An alternative approach would have been to remind her that your town is really conservative, she's beautiful in her goth clothing, and you've got her back. She would have changed her clothes if she weighed the risk of comments more than her personal expression. It would have been her decision entirely. Now the damage is done. Explain your intentions (to protect her), apologize, and tell her you will do better in the future. You weren't trying to be a jerk, so hopefully she will understand.", "NTA. You made a suggestion, that's all. If you insisted or kept pestering her about changing her clothes, then YWBTA", "NAH.\n\n You were trying to protect her, you thought you made the right choice but it wasn't. \n\nI'd also be upset if my partner didn't back me, even if it was just how I dress. My hubby is not confrontational but if someone was nasty to me he would stand up for me and build me back up.\n\nWe can't give into cruel people's wants by dressing a certain way, acting a certain way etc. We need to be ourselves proudly or the world will never change", "You sit her down and tell her you love her and what she wears, and you were only trying to protect her not control her.\nBut she can\u2019t be mad at you and upset at comments for what she wears when out. She has to have enough spine not to care about comments when out.", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA.\n\nIf your reasoning had been something along the lines of \"I don't want my parents judging her\" or \"I would be embarrassed walking around a conservative town beside her dressed goth\" YWBTA\n\nBut it sounds like your reasoning is \"she gets upset when people make comments, so I made the suggestion to help avoid a situation where she'd get upset\". Basically sounds like you made the recommendation in an effort to be caring, not controlling.", "NTA as an older punk/goth girl in her late 30s your girlfriend needs to have a bit more spine and a idgf what people think additude. You were being kind growing up in a small conservative town myself I know people can be crule and say mean things when you don't dress like a girly girl or have a souther girl style. You were trying to look out for her because she hasn't grown the back bone yet to go with her style. Instead of her not dressing goth completely she can try and tone it down some a pair of jeans, a jack skeleton t-shirt or one of her favorite and a pair of running shoes. Having her tone down instead of not dressing herself at all should give her the comfort of being herself but toning down the stares. But also remind her how you love her dark charm you were just trying to protect her from the small town minds. Good luck from old goth mom.", "NTA\n\nIn life we have to realise that we need very tough skin to dress flamboyantly, if you can't handle it then don't do it! \nWe also need to understand occasion and culture won't change just because we show up dressed flamboyantly, when in Rome as they say...\n\nYour gf is sensitive about comments on her flamboyant dress style, your intentions were good, you are both young and it takes time to get used to the fact that expressing yourself will get you noticed and not everyone has nice comments to make.", "NTA, I get where you\u2019re coming from, it doesn\u2019t sound as if you\u2019re being controlling in this instance however I\u2019m sure she\u2019d prefer you to back her up and let her express herself how she wants, rather than her feeling like she has to change because other people can\u2019t cope with seeing someone a bit different. People staring are rude, and not her problem and she should not have to change for them. And you should have her back!", "NAH, maybe it came across differently from how you meant it", "Presuming that you really did it out of care for how she would feel, NTA. But regardless of your intentions, I can see how it might come across more negative.", "NTA. When you have a distinct, unique, eccentric style you kind of have to get used to the looks and comments and learn to deal with them, because it's going to happen. (I'm not a goth, but I do have a unique look that often gets comments and looks, especially when not in my home of NYC).\n\nSince you know from experience that currently comments such as those upset your girlfriend greatly, it makes sense to sit her down and explain the vibe of the town where your parents live. That she can expect that if she wears her normal goth clothes, she may get weird looks and comments, and you love and appreciate her style, and if she wants to accept the possible outcome, well then, yay! Keep that head held high and strut (or skulk more gothily)! But if  your gf feels that the looks and comments you expect she'll experience there will upset her, especially while with your parents, she may want to find a way to tone it down a notch. She doesn't have to completely abandon her look, but maybe more goth-light. That also comes with the nature of eccentric styling -- being able to read the room and occasion and work your style accordingly.", "NTA", "NTA - it\u2019s a communication issue. maybe explaining to her that the area you live in has a lot of judgey type people so its better to dress conservatively. sometimes we have to do these things For example, if you travel abroad to a foreign country you\u2019d want to adhere to their dress code . It\u2019s the way of life etc. work on the communication and give her ur reasonings", "NTA. You didn\u2019t have bad intentions and you didn\u2019t dictate anything.", "NAH. It sounds like you were just trying to protect her. Maybe she has experienced somebody trying to control her in the past and it brought back bad memories. Also, most people who dress in goth fashion have experienced bullying or at least stares and weird looks for it at some point, so it\u2019s possible that she is \u201cused to it\u201d and doesn\u2019t care, and thinks that for some reason you do. Maybe it\u2019s best to just clarify that you only said it to protect her and not because it would bother you in any capacity. Tell her you are proud of her and that you look forward to showing her off just the way she is, no matter what she is wearing, but it was only ever to protect her.", "NTA. It is a fact that people have eyes, opinions and mouths to say such things to her and if that is something that very much bothers her then she should make a change to make her life better. You noticed she is unhappy because of something and offered a solution to prevent her from further suffering, there\u2019s nothing offensive or controlling about that. Controlling would be TELLING her she must do something, not just suggesting something with the intention of helping her. If she wants her life to be better she has to be the one to make changes, she can\u2019t continuously blame other people for the consequences of her own actions. People notice things that don\u2019t blend in and she\u2019s going to have to like that if she doesn\u2019t want to blend in.", "YTA but not on purpose. Your intentions were good, but she's an adult and knows people will stare. Let her deal with it. If she wants your help, she will ask for it.", "NTA, the real world for actual grown ups sucks", "NTA and you made a sensible suggestion considering she\u2019s getting upset when she hears these comments. You\u2019re not being controlling, you\u2019re trying to find a solution for her upset.", "NAH u had good intentions simple as that. But ur gf probably took it as an attack, u could try and make her see that u do love the way she dresses and it was a suggestion for the betterment of her mental health not an attempt to change who she is or control her, this is just a bit of miscommunication \ud83e\udef6", "YTA. You were clearly not being malicious but that's not the point. When you see people bully someone, in this instance your girlfriend, the correct response isn't to tell her she should capitulate to the harassment. Which is what you did. \n\nExpecting people to change perfectly normal, benign behaviour in order to avoid being treated in a negative manner by peoole who's behaviour is actually rude and inappropriate is not ok. Don't police your girlfriend, support her.", "NTA she over reacted. It was a suggestion, you didn\u2019t command her, shes welcome to say no thanks, and do whatever she wants", "It seems like a good time to point out the difference between intention and impact. \n\nI believe you when you say that your intention was to spare her from judgmental comments. Your words were intended to protect her and support her. Unfortunately, the impact of those words were the opposite of what you intended. Instead she felt like you were trying to control her and change her so she could fit in to this judgmental small town. \n\nApologize for your unintended impact. Don\u2019t get caught up in defending your intentions. That often comes across as though you don\u2019t care that you hurt them if they can\u2019t acknowledge that you didn\u2019t mean to. \n\nTry something like: \u201cI love you and I\u2019m sorry that what I said didn\u2019t come across as supportive. Is there anything I can do to help if people make comments?\u201d", "NTA. Simply there are places where you should dress accordingly.", "NAH towards mild YTA due to lack of tact; you shouldn't tell her to change her outfit because people will give her shit about it, you should ask her if she is mentally/emotionally prepared to deal with shit from other people despite the two of you thinking she looks great", "Damned if you damned if you don't. Whatever you do don't tell her I told you so when it happens.", "YTA. She should be allowed to wear what she likes without being told to change or getting comments about it", "YTA\n\nShe should be able to leave the house however she wants without some assholes harassing her about it.", "Yta. What you should have done was warn her that unfortunately your hometown is very old fashioned and stuck and so people won\u2019t understand and possibly be assholes.", "Light YTA, I know your intentions weren't meant maliciously but telling her to change her clothes almost feeds into the narrative that there's something wrong with her and not those people picking on her", "YTA - she's an adult\n\n> A few months ago when we were out together some old guy said something mean to her about what she was wearing and it really upset her.\n\nAnd you didn't say anything to him about minding his own business?
