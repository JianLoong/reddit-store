I can't imagine not comforting someone I loved when they were in terrible pain.", "YTA\n\nLol. I brush, floss and use mouthwash twice a day and still end up with cavities. \n\nDo you even love this guy? He's in pain and you're just...annoyed with him. You can't even bother yourself to care about or minimally support this person that you supposedly want to spend your life with. I seriously hope he opens his eyes and ditches you because you are one cold asshole.", "Tooth pain is some of the worst that you can actually have, just so you know. It is also not completely preventable by brushing and/or seeing a dentist. \n\nSo...yeah, YTA for telling him it was all his fault instead of comforting him. Even if it was preventable, \"I told you so\" is an AH thing to say to someone you allegedly love when they're in pain.", "YTA he\u2019s doing more than most people. How can you be annoyed someone you\u2019re suppose to love is in pain. Where\u2019s your compassion. You have no idea his pain was avoidable - he hasn\u2019t been to a dentist, unless you\u2019re one - you don\u2019t know why he\u2019s in pain. Youre acting heartless.", "YTA - okay, he doesn't go to the dentist like he should, but you're completely wrong to say \"he doesn\u2019t do any preventative care\".  According to you, he brushes, flosses, and uses mouthwash.  That's a lot more than many people.\n\nAs far as you, you wouldn't take him to the ER in the middle of the night, you don't have compassion, and sound ridiculously judgmental.\n\nI kind of hope he comes to his senses and ends it with you, because you sound unbearable.", "Do you want to be right, or do you want to be a supportive partner? ESH, he needs to make the appointment but being actively mean to him as he is likely experiencing a walking nightmare while avoiding a major fear as long as possible isn't going to help anybody.", "I only brush my teeth once a day (in the morning) and I have impeccable teeth. Even the dentist said so.  Don't judge everyone the same.\n\nHowever I would say that cancelling your dentist appointments and not scheduling emergency ones is down right idiotic and I can sort of see why you don't have sympathy. On the other hand, he may have a fear of dentists that he doesn't want to talk to you about as you seem to be quite vocal about his habits!", "I'm gonna go ahead and vote EHS. He actually does a lot more than most people. Sure they might brush their teeth twice a day, but how many people can say they floss regularly AND use mouthwash daily? That is actually preventative care. Some people are more prone to dental issues regardless of the precautions they take as well. He also has a very valid fear of the dentist, as many, many people do.\n\nYou might be right that brushing an extra time a day might have prevented this, but this certainly isn't an \"I told you so\" moment. Kicking a person while they're down isn't helpful. Hopefully he learns from this.", "YTA, Fear of Doctors is a thing. \n\n\"He does nothing to prevent this... proceeds to list things he does to prevent this\"\n\n\"He is pain... I Don't care, not my prob\"\n\nWhat??????", "YTA. Holy shit. Like. You're dating. Presumably in love. And your response to him being in literal pain is to be annoyed at him? Bruh. What the fuck.", "ESH.  He let this go and is responsible for his own suffering.  Him brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash is probably more oral care than most people do, FYI.  That being said, you suck as a gf.  You're well within your rights to not go to the ER with him and brush him off when he's miserable.  I suspect he will be brushing you off soon as well.  It's called proper relationship hygiene.", "ESH. \n\nRather than being an ass to him, you should have set boundaries. \"I'm sorry your teeth hurt, but I don't want to keep hearing about something where there's a solution you can pursue to fix it. I will not talk to you about going to the dentist anymore, but if you complain to me, I will leave the room. I'm happy to go with you to the dentist for support if you want help from me in that way.\"\n\nHe's an asshole for not just going to the fucking dentist to get it addressed. The fact that he went to the ER multiple times with his mom for the pain and still hasn't gotten around to addressing it is not acceptable behavior.", "YTA, imo this is a time when you internally know you were right, but also support him and help him. Not every thought has to be spoken.", "ESH, but this is about more than the toothache.  You're sick of mothering a grown man (understandable) but you're responding by being pretty mean (not ok).\n\nYou two need to sit down after this an hash out whether you two can make it work.", "Flossing is actually better than brushing teeth. YTA and don't deserve to be in a relationship where you don't like your boyfriend", "YTA. He's taking decent care of his teeth, and even if he wasn't he wouldn't deserve to be in pain. There are many reasons why people have trouble keeping up with hygiene that aren't just laziness. In addition, things like cavities and tooth problems in general can have genetic factors as well! One of my best friends has lost several teeth not due to poor hygiene but simply because tooth problems run in his family. Also, tooth pain can be exquisitely awful, some of the worst out there bc of the sensitive nerves. Show some compassion. How would you feel if you were in terrible pain and your loved ones refused to comfort you?", "YTA. I hope you get all ll of your preventive check ups otherwise if you get cancer he can just blow you off, like oh well you did it to yourself.  Geez. You say you love this guy.", "NTA. I have a zero-tolerance policy for people who won't see to their own health, so I sympathize with you. \n\nHowever, at some point you either need to 1) realize this is a dealbreaker for you; or 2) accept the situation and offer a minimal level of basic support (or at least neutrality instead of a lecture).", "YTA. Dentists are incredibly judgemental and they tend to shame patients for the slightest things, and a lot of childhood trauma can come from seeing the dentist. He does more preventative care than most people.", "YTA. Tooth pain is vile. I can understand you're not happy with him now after, but the fact that you didn't assist him to the ER last month, which seems to be his first dental emergency from your story, is awful.", "... summarize my thoughts with YTA", "I guess NAH or ESH \n\nSo you\u2019re not wrong that this was probably preventable. But I also think if you can\u2019t be bothered to sit in the emergency room with your partner when they\u2019re in terrible pain, or say anything other than \u201cwhat did you expect?\u201d when they pain comes back, they will start to feel resentful that they can\u2019t rely on you for comfort. If you don\u2019t feel like he deserves that in that scenario, that\u2019s fine. But maybe you\u2019re just not the right fit for each other. My partner has had bad pain as a result of something they could have prevented or they directly caused before and my first reaction usually isn\u2019t \u201cI told you so!\u201d", "YTA for the simple fact that you lack empathy for your partner. You seem like you don\u2019t even like this person and his tooth pain is now a way for you to express that. \n\nHe probably has full intent to be better with his dental care since humans usually learn from the consequences of our actions, which probably doesn\u2019t matter to you because you\u2019re basically glad he\u2019s in pain because it proves you were right.", "YTA. I get where you're coming from with the frustration on him not doing like he should (going to the dentist) but to simply \"Sucks to be you, get over yourself\" really demonstrates a lack of compassion. Regardless if someone's pain was preventable, you're acting like a callous asshole", "NTA- he is responsible for his current situation and it was preventable.", "NTA. I am a problem solver type person so obviously I too would be pissed if someone wanted sympathy for something they could take care of. He cannot expect you to want to listen to him whine all the time or go to the ER where they cannot actually fix the issue. How can you go to the ER a bunch but not an actual tooth specialist lol?\n\nAs for your bf, I get it- I hate dentists and after being an addict for over 10 years have horrible teeth. I am talking the majority of my teeth are broken. Had an abscess once. But I have been told more than once that dental pain can be the cause of an infection that can travel through your bloodstream to your major organs and can KILL YOU. \n\nI went to a pharmacy clinic a couple times for antibiotics for what I assumed was an infected tooth from bad tooth pain, and the clinic nurse told me that a family member of hers died from a blood infection, which fully freaked me out. Now I do not avoid appts I used to cancel out of anxiety, bc death is much worse. \n\nI have an anxiety disorder and panic attacks, and when I have to see a dentist it is all triggered badly, but when I explained this to my dentists and also discussed my past with drugs etc he was so very nice about everything, didn't judge me for my horrible teeth, and even prescribed me a valium for the next few appointments until I became more comfy with the routine of all the work, bc it was a fuckton of root canals, some extractions, and crowns. Now I am way more at ease, and only experience anxiety like the morning of the appt and am fine by the time I am seated in the dentist chair.\n\nIt could be an infection or an abscess which is dangerous. If something is broken or a cavity it could be nerve pain he is experiencing which is the most painful. Please make him see a dentist, get him a valium or an ativan from his primary care dr if he needs it first to chill out, but he can also try sensodyne toothpaste and there is nubing mouth wash you can buy too. Take the sensodyne toothpaste and rub it on the gum and painful tooth like a salve, don't rinse it out. That's only a minor solution though, he needs to see a dentists and likely get antibiotics.", "NTA\n\nTough Love!!", "YTA He might be an idiot, but he's your boyfriend and if you love him you should comfort him. I'm not saying stop riding his ass to see his dentist, but if your in a relationship you should be in his corner. You would want the same for you and whatever dumbass decisions you make, and we all make them.", "Info: Why\u2019d his dental care stop being your business once he started experiencing pain? \n\nIf you actually cared you\u2019d still care now.
