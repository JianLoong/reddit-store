I brush, floss and use mouthwash twice a day and still end up with cavities. \n\nDo you even love this guy? He's in pain and you're just...annoyed with him. You can't even bother yourself to care about or minimally support this person that you supposedly want to spend your life with. I seriously hope he opens his eyes and ditches you because you are one cold asshole.", "Tooth pain is some of the worst that you can actually have, just so you know. It is also not completely preventable by brushing and/or seeing a dentist. \n\nSo...yeah, YTA for telling him it was all his fault instead of comforting him. Even if it was preventable, \"I told you so\" is an AH thing to say to someone you allegedly love when they're in pain.", "YTA he\u2019s doing more than most people. How can you be annoyed someone you\u2019re suppose to love is in pain. Where\u2019s your compassion. You have no idea his pain was avoidable - he hasn\u2019t been to a dentist, unless you\u2019re one - you don\u2019t know why he\u2019s in pain. Youre acting heartless.", "YTA - okay, he doesn't go to the dentist like he should, but you're completely wrong to say \"he doesn\u2019t do any preventative care\".  According to you, he brushes, flosses, and uses mouthwash.  That's a lot more than many people.\n\nAs far as you, you wouldn't take him to the ER in the middle of the night, you don't have compassion, and sound ridiculously judgmental.\n\nI kind of hope he comes to his senses and ends it with you, because you sound unbearable.", "Do you want to be right, or do you want to be a supportive partner? ESH, he needs to make the appointment but being actively mean to him as he is likely experiencing a walking nightmare while avoiding a major fear as long as possible isn't going to help anybody.", "I only brush my teeth once a day (in the morning) and I have impeccable teeth. Even the dentist said so.  Don't judge everyone the same.\n\nHowever I would say that cancelling your dentist appointments and not scheduling emergency ones is down right idiotic and I can sort of see why you don't have sympathy.

He actually does a lot more than most people. Sure they might brush their teeth twice a day, but how many people can say they floss regularly AND use mouthwash daily? That is actually preventative care. Some people are more prone to dental issues regardless of the precautions they take as well. He also has a very valid fear of the dentist, as many, many people do.\n\nYou might be right that brushing an extra time a day might have prevented this, but this certainly isn't an \"I told you so\" moment. Kicking a person while they're down isn't helpful.

What the fuck.", "ESH.  He let this go and is responsible for his own suffering.  Him brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash is probably more oral care than most people do, FYI.  That being said, you suck as a gf.  You're well within your rights to not go to the ER with him and brush him off when he's miserable.  I suspect he will be brushing you off soon as well.  It's called proper relationship hygiene.", "ESH. \n\nRather than being an ass to him, you should have set boundaries. \"I'm sorry your teeth hurt, but I don't want to keep hearing about something where there's a solution you can pursue to fix it. I will not talk to you about going to the dentist anymore, but if you complain to me, I will leave the room. I'm happy to go with you to the dentist for support if you want help from me in that way.\"\n\nHe's an asshole for not just going to the fucking dentist to get it addressed. The fact that he went to the ER multiple times with his mom for the pain and still hasn't gotten around to addressing it is not acceptable behavior.", "YTA, imo this is a time when you internally know you were right, but also support him and help him.

YTA and don't deserve to be in a relationship where you don't like your boyfriend", "YTA. He's taking decent care of his teeth, and even if he wasn't he wouldn't deserve to be in pain. There are many reasons why people have trouble keeping up with hygiene that aren't just laziness. In addition, things like cavities and tooth problems in general can have genetic factors as well! One of my best friends has lost several teeth not due to poor hygiene but simply because tooth problems run in his family. Also, tooth pain can be exquisitely awful, some of the worst out there bc of the sensitive nerves. Show some compassion.

Dentists are incredibly judgemental and they tend to shame patients for the slightest things, and a lot of childhood trauma can come from seeing the dentist. He does more preventative care than most people.", "YTA. Tooth pain is vile. I can understand you're not happy with him now after, but the fact that you didn't assist him to the ER last month, which seems to be his first dental emergency from your story, is awful.", "... summarize my thoughts with YTA", "I guess NAH or ESH \n\nSo you\u2019re not wrong that this was probably preventable.

If you don\u2019t feel like he deserves that in that scenario, that\u2019s fine. But maybe you\u2019re just not the right fit for each other. My partner has had bad pain as a result of something they could have prevented or they directly caused before and my first reaction usually isn\u2019t \u201cI told you so!\u201d", "YTA for the simple fact that you lack empathy for your partner. You seem like you don\u2019t even like this person and his tooth pain is now a way for you to express that. \n\nHe probably has full intent to be better with his dental care since humans usually learn from the consequences of our actions, which probably doesn\u2019t matter to you because you\u2019re basically glad he\u2019s in pain because it proves you were right.", "YTA. I get where you're coming from with the frustration on him not doing like he should (going to the dentist) but to simply \"Sucks to be you, get over yourself\" really demonstrates a lack of compassion. Regardless if someone's pain was preventable, you're acting like a callous asshole", "NTA- he is responsible for his current situation and it was preventable.", "NTA. I am a problem solver type person so obviously I too would be pissed if someone wanted sympathy for something they could take care of. He cannot expect you to want to listen to him whine all the time or go to the ER where they cannot actually fix the issue. How can you go to the ER a bunch but not an actual tooth specialist lol?\n\nAs for your bf, I get it- I hate dentists and after being an addict for over 10 years have horrible teeth. I am talking the majority of my teeth are broken. Had an abscess once. But I have been told more than once that dental pain can be the cause of an infection that can travel through your bloodstream to your major organs and can KILL YOU. \n\nI went to a pharmacy clinic a couple times for antibiotics for what I assumed was an infected tooth from bad tooth pain, and the clinic nurse told me that a family member of hers died from a blood infection, which fully freaked me out. Now I do not avoid appts I used to cancel out of anxiety, bc death is much worse. \n\nI have an anxiety disorder and panic attacks, and when I have to see a dentist it is all triggered badly, but when I explained this to my dentists and also discussed my past with drugs etc he was so very nice about everything, didn't judge me for my horrible teeth, and even prescribed me a valium for the next few appointments until I became more comfy with the routine of all the work, bc it was a fuckton of root canals, some extractions, and crowns. Now I am way more at ease, and only experience anxiety like the morning of the appt and am fine by the time I am seated in the dentist chair.\n\nIt could be an infection or an abscess which is dangerous. If something is broken or a cavity it could be nerve pain he is experiencing which is the most painful. Please make him see a dentist, get him a valium or an ativan from his primary care dr if he needs it first to chill out, but he can also try sensodyne toothpaste and there is nubing mouth wash you can buy too. Take the sensodyne toothpaste and rub it on the gum and painful tooth like a salve, don't rinse it out. That's only a minor solution though, he needs to see a dentists and likely get antibiotics.", "NTA\n\nTough Love!!", "YTA He might be an idiot, but he's your boyfriend and if you love him you should comfort him. I'm not saying stop riding his ass to see his dentist, but if your in a relationship you should be in his corner. You would want the same for you and whatever dumbass decisions you make, and we all make them.", "Info: Why\u2019d his dental care stop being your business once he started experiencing pain? \n\nIf you actually cared you\u2019d still care now.

I also just think you suck in general tbh like even if my boyfriend was suffering from something truly self inflicted I\u2019d comfort him cause yknow I love him.", "INFO - You said you've voiced your disgust with his brushing habits, does his breath smell? If you've been dealing with that, trying to get him to change to no avail, I'd be pretty annoyed too.", "ESH. I can see both points of view but at the end of the day,\u2019partners are expected to be supportive and not just blame the victim. \n\nAre you perfect? Ie could you say you\u2019ve always worn sunscreen and prevented all forms of skin cancer (although can strike regardless!), can you say you\u2019ve never smoked anything and prevented all forms of lung cancer?, can you say you always eat healthily and exercised and there\u2019s no way you\u2019d have any heart problems? What if something went wrong regardless\u2026.would bf comfort you?", "ESH.  BF should take better care of his teeth, and is in fact suffering a self-inflicted L.  OP, being in a relationship usually implies that you're in your boo's corner, and can be sympathetic even if the situation is his fault.  \"Well, he deserved it, oh well\" is a more typical reaction to a stranger's distress.  Could be that the recriminations could wait until after BF actually gets his teeth fixed, eh?", "NTA, but just book him an appointment the moment he first mentions pain. First, tooth pain never just goes away. It subsides, but continues to get worse over time. Second, he is having mental health issues. He is an adult, but he obviously isn't doing the one thing everyone around him knows he should be doing.", "NTA \n\nI am surprised and disgusted by the number of people who think brushing once per day is adequate, but the fact that he has rejected everything you\u2019ve don\u2019t to try and get him to a dentist before it became a catastrophe is just, well\u2026 what does he expect?", "ESH. If your boyfriend is already doing that much dental care, it is likely there are risk factors outside of brushing that triggered the cavity. Everything from the amount of and type of saliva people produce to how much sugar and acidic foods they eat to genetic dispositions that make cavities more likely. I think you don't like that he only brushes once a day and are using this situation to prove yourself correct and make him change his behavior without actually addressing how important this is to you.\n\nOn the other hand he has known about this problem for quite a while but didn't work to solve it when he could so I understand being frustrated at his self inflicted pain. But using this type of situation to \"I told you so\" him while he is suffering is a great way for everyone to build resentment and find yourself on the receiving end of the same treatment one day. And as much as anyone \"deserves\" the logical result of their actions, pain sucks and most people would be really hurt by their partner dismissing them. People in pain aren't going to react calmly or rationally because they are busy focusing on the pain. Bring this up some other time if you actually want to talk about it rather than just rub his nose in it.", "ESH\n\nI get the frustration. He missed an appointment from **last year**, so at least 6 months ago. Still hasn\u2019t rescheduled it, but is in this much pain. I\u2019d be annoyed too. However, I have a fear of the dentists as well, so if that\u2019s why for him, I get it. BUT, if I was experiencing pain like that I\u2019d be there quick af.\n\nBut, damn, he\u2019s still your boyfriend. Idk. I\u2019m not sure what else you can say to make him go\u2026..? Offer to go with him? Idk. Because, I think you should comfort him, but is it just gonna be the same song and dance for x amount of time?", "NTA unless it\u2019s a money issue. Dentist is EXPENSIVE but if he\u2019s going to the ER, I doubt money is the issue. If he\u2019s got a fear of the dentist, he needs to go to therapy and deal with it. This isn\u2019t just a \u201coh this issue just popped up and he can\u2019t go to the dentist\u201d it\u2019s \u201che\u2019s avoiding the dentist and the solution to his problem\u201d op is just tired of consoling someone who refuses to address and solve the issue. I\u2019d be pretty upset too.", "Start comforting him for being unable to follow directions from medical personnel after visiting the emergency room...\n\nNTA", "NTA. I can see why you\u2019re annoyed if this has been an ongoing problem. He needs to go see a dentist. To all the people saying he is doing enough by brushing and using mouthwash, he\u2019s obviously not doing enough if he\u2019s having pain in his tooth. Doing enough would be going to the dentist to get it taken care of the moment he felt discomfort. I was once in his shoes. I had not been to a dentist in about 15 years and had 3 broken teeth. It was scary to go in and hear what else needed to be done and it was also expensive. But now I can eat without worrying about my teeth falling apart and I can enjoy cold foods now, which I couldn\u2019t with the broken teeth. Now I go regularly and am still fixing past issues but nothing major anymore.", "NTA.  But I also suck at comforting people when they could have prevented an issue.  I once told my ex I hoped his leg fell off because he wouldn't go to a doctor for a non-healing wound on his calf. It is very annoying when you're supposed to have sympathy for someone who is partly to blame for their situation.\n\nThat said, I don't floss daily and only brush once a day...I do see a dentist twice a year, but save for a couple cavities over the years my teeth are in fine shape. So maybe don't judge so harshly that he doesn't do \"any\" preventative care...flossing regularly is more than many people do even.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like he has been asking for your comfort a lot. The only comfort he needs is an initial sympathetic ear from you, maybe some help scheduling an appointment if you're feeling generous and actual treatment from the dentist. Expecting you to continue emotionally supporting him for an issue that's very easily fixable is going to drain you and the relationship.\n\nYou're allowed to experience compassion fatigue and that doesn't make you a bad person.", "Clove oil - $6 @ any convenience store, \n\nTemporary relief, but effective.", "YTA. I don't care if he literally only splashed some mouthwash once a day. You're supposed to care about this person and it's very clear you only care as long as he's obeying you and living to your standards. I hope he wises up, leaves you, finds someone who isn't so selfish.", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019re going to act this shitty towards him then you might as well break up. What a shitty way to treat your partner.", "Nta. But please brush 3x a day", "yta", "Downvote me if you want, but NTA.\n\nThis has been going on for a month now. It\u2019s no longer an emergency, it\u2019s a habit. There is an obvious solution here\u2014*see a goddamn dentist*. Boyfriend is refusing to enact that solution. In your position, I\u2019d be fed up too. I mean, three ER visits in one night? Sorry but if you have the money and the wherewithal for that you have the money and the wherewithal for a dentist. This cycle of pain/comfort/no change isn\u2019t working for anyone. \n\nGranted, I think you should focus less on the \u2018I told you so\u2019 part of this and more on the \u2018you need to stop fucking around and actually try to solve this\u2019 part. But I also understand being fully tapped out wrt comfort, and not wanting to mother a grown man, so on that front, I get it.", "Yta. I hope you never experience the pain of that. If you do I hope you have huge regrets.", "I have horrible teeth due to some medical conditions and also guzzling diet coke for 40 years. I am currently in excruciating pain after having an extraction earlier in the week. If I would have had a gun last night I probably would have shot myself in the face. It's miserable and you can't even think straight when your mouth hurts that bad. Some people are dead afraid of the dentist and don't go. Also, some people can't afford the dentist. $3000 for a root canal and a crown? Well I guess $450 to have it pulled is going to be the way to go, especially when you have a few bad ones to deal with.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. I do feel like he is doing a fair amount of prevention except for one major thing, going to the dentist. Yes tooth pain freaking sucks. It can be incapacitating. But when it happens, you call the effing dentist. If he is just straight up not doing that then he really isn\u2019t doing anything to help himself. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s going to the ER but not the dentist. \n\nSome people are genetically predisposed to having weak enamel and yea can have more tooth problems. The answer to this\u2026.GO TO THE DENTIST! If he doesn\u2019t have dental insurance that\u2019s different. But if he does then yea NTA.", "Yta, and you should get off of your high horse. Your routines are nearly the same. You aren't better than him, although you clearly think you are.", "OP perhaps your boyfriend is afraid of the dentist. Have some compassion for him. YTA", "YTA. Anyone who unironically says \u201cI told you so\u201d or anything like it is a big AH. It accomplishes nothing and makes you look bad for not caring.", "Yta.  Break up with this poor guy so he can find someone with empathy", ">He was given a number to call to schedule with an emergency dental office and he never called.\n\nQuote from the OP. This is what changes OP from TA to NTA. The boyfriend was literally told by medical professionals that he needed to schedule an appointment with a dentist, and did not.", "Genetics can also play a factor. Sometimes you can do everything right and it still just doesn't work out. I too can't imagine not supporting someone in pain!", "I thought twice a day was the norm, I hope once a day is still okay I dunno", "Or imagine if she gets a sports injury or gains a bunch of weight.  BF could be merciless then.  Unless he's a good partner.", "I can't imagine his breath could smell that bad if he's flossing regularly, brushing once a day and using mouthwash. I mean, yeah he should be brushing more, but with him doing at least a single brushing and mouthwash daily unless he has a disease his breath should be fine.", "but OPs a bad partner for not being there for for her boyfriend when he was in pain. it doesnt matter if you were right or not. there is a right time to tell someone something like this, this time was not.", "what if the pain is being caused by something else. he brushes, flosses and uses mouthwash, that is enough. ya maybe he could brush twice a day, but he does more than what a lot of people do. and if someone you love and care about is in pain, youre going to comfort them, not tell them that they should have done this, this, and this. you can tell them that later, its not the right time. OP is YTA", "unfortunately tooth care doesn't trump genetics. some people can do the bare minimum and be fine- others can do everything right and have horrible teeth", "In fairness, you aren't responsible or really involved with a cousin or uncle like you are with a partner.  A partner's health problems affect you far more.", "I agree. He had to go to ER for the pain. Was given referral but chose not do anything. So this pain is the consequence of his inaction. I mean don\u2019t be an ass, but at this point it would be hard to drum up any sympathy.", "Yup. I would be *pissed* if my boyfriend insisted on waking me up at 2am to escort him to the ER for a problem that he straight-out refuses to solve. Especially in the US, where the cost of care is so high. Like you want me to get out of bed and spend hundreds of dollars so you can get temporary pain relief and more advice that you refuse to follow? That\u2019s not compassion, that\u2019s enabling.", "It depends on the mouth really. Many people get by with once a day, particularly if they floss and mouthwash, just fine. Twice is recommended more because people don't usually brush well enough to do less. Some people have bad mouth chemistry, just born that way, and need to brush every time they eat something.", "In this economy?", "A lot of people don't have dental insurance and can't afford to pay for that without it.", "Yeah, it shouldn't be that suprising. It's those of us in good relationships where we care about our partners even when they fuck up.", "I go go the dentist twice a year. I brush once a day, rarely floss, never use mouthwash\u2026.never had a single cavity or any other issue. My wife brushes 2-3 times a day\u2026always deals with cavities. We eat the same foods. Genetics trumps anything else we do.", "Very true. I have one of each for parents and I took after the one who can do anything right and still get cavities. My partner is the type who has flawless teeth no matter what. Siiiigh", "Yep I inherited the bad teeth genes. I brush, floss, and use mouthwash but I\u2019m still at the dentist at least once a year with a cavity or root canal. My teeth also grow in weird. My wisdom grew in sideways and was pushing the other teeth away and one molar was growing into my cheek. \n\nMy husband on the other hand has great teeth genes. He didn\u2019t go the dentist for like ten years and didn\u2019t have a single cavity. He only brushes no flossing or mouthwash.", "This sounds more like he\u2019s just too scared to go, not that he cant afford it.", "Also, a lot of people went longer than normal between dentist visits because of the pandemic.", "Okay but if you have a tooth infection, schedule a dentist appointment rather than just thinking it not hurting anymore means it\u2019s cured.", "It is. Consult your dentist. Most people don\u2019t even brush daily. Let alone use floss ever.", "He missed 1 appointment. That's no excuse for A) not taking your partner who is in pain, to a medical professional and B) have no sympathy for them when they are in pain. Even if he went to his appointments some medical issues aren't preventable, even oral health. \n\nHe learned his lesson. You can brush 2x a day and see your dentist regularly and still get cavities or have oral issues. It's not am end all be all.", "To be fair, I've heard that over brushing weakens the enamel.", "She says \"His pain was 100% avoidable.\"", "No, he failed to follow up after going to the ER MULTIPLE TIMES."]}
