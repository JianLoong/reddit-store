That must suck for him.  I feel for him and his relationship with his kids even more if you initiated the divorce, less if he's the reason.  Either way, it happened, and he needs to figure out his own place in his kids new lives.  You agreeing that the kids will keep their things at your place is a good compromise.  Not one that will work out well, I think, for Kyle in the long run, but one that shows your willingness to compromise now when co-parenting your kids.

Your ex isn't wrong, your husband IS buying the kids' affections at this point. And you're really happy about it too, you want to replace your ex with your current husband. And he might take you to court for parental alienation. Which is what it feels like, reading this post. You're being awful to Kyle, he doesn't deserve it. He's their father, not your current husband. YTA", "I\u2019m going rogue and saying YTA. New gaming systems are generally a pretty big deal for kids, and while the two of us can afford to buy/replace gaming systems as soon as they come out for each house for our kid, we do not because we are on the same page with our parenting. \n\nThere are many solid reasons to not just buy your kids every little thing they want, regardless of income. And by telling Kyle he can spend money full bore on the kids, you\u2019re effectively throwing down the gauntlet for a competition to buy the kids affection. I get you\u2019re salty about the Jeff rumors, but don\u2019t let your pique translate into bad parenting.", "You put \"spoiling\" the kids in quotes and also wrote that the new guy's way of showing love is through giving.

Maybe he is trying to win their affection with material goods that dwarf what their dad can afford. \n\nSo maybe you are a bit of an asshole, and it should be you, not the ex, who should ask your husband to ease up a bit on the gift deluge, so the kids really aren't spoiled.", "It sounds to me like you enjoy bragging about the fact that you got married a man who makes more money, YTA", "YTA, you\u2019re flaunting new husband\u2019s money as if it were yours.

Though I'm also considering E S H (with the exception of Jeff, who just seems like a golden retriever of a person)\n\nKyle absolutely needs to work on his insecurities. If you're being 100% honest and you and Jeff didn't get back into contact until you were divorced, then it just feels like Kyle is trying to make up some sort of cheating story in his mind to excuse improving himself post-divorce. \"I wasn't the problem! I don't have anything to work on! She just cheated on me!\" and then started grasping at straws.\n\nI get it... parents get all competitive in this situation. But he's not even giving his kids enough credit to love him as a person, as their dad. He thinks his kids will only love whoever can buy them things. And he clearly doesn't think well enough of himself that his kids would still love him if he didn't spoil them. That being said...\n\nEven though he's being a jerk about it, I don't think it's constructive to entirely dismiss his insecurities. It's just going to escalate any bad vibes between you. Everyone struggles with insecurities so he shouldn't be treated like a crazy person for feeling like he's slipping out of his kids' life. So for that, I do need to ding you. Continue being firm, but don't be dismissive. After all, Kyle is still *trying* to be their dad which is a lot more than some divorced parents try to be. He's just going about it... clumsily.

You should be concerned about that also.\n\nJeff sucks because he's spoiling your kids and not respecting, or even acknowledging, the need for reasonable boundaries and thoughtfulness about it.\n\nYou suck, OP, because you are condescending and dismissive of Kyle's reasonable concerns, and are therefore blind to the real risk that Jeff's money will turn your kids into spoiled, entitled assholes (and that they will hate Kyle for trying to bring some appropriate balance into their lives).

Your kids are at a very vulnerable age right now, and tbh I think it\u2019s really shitty you aren\u2019t making more of an effort to let them see their dad more frequently. If you think he\u2019s a fine parent, why such resistance to 50/50. As a child of divorced parents, the single most important thing they did for us was shared custody. An hour drive is hard, but not too hard to give him only \u201cvisitation.\u201d He\u2019s trying really hard to stay in their lives, and now they have a new figure coming in with lavish gifts?

I\u2019d honestly be shocked if new guy\u2019s ploys with expensive gifts ISN\u2019T having the kids want to see their dad less because they have better toys with you.

In either case Kyle is entitled to have an opinion about this and I think that you should be willing to engage with his opinion, up to a point.

It would be reasonable to agree on boundaries for things like tech in advance and have shared plans for keeping kids humble & healthy. There are also legitimate reasons to want boundaries on gift giving for the kids development. Also it is reasonable for him as a parent to get a heads up about some of these purchases in case he is planning to give the same/similar item himself, and to even have the right to veto it occasionally if he wants to be the one to give the big present. He is their parent too, these decisions are not yours to make alone despite your attitude!\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you are supporting your kids relationship with their dad at all, fighting against his custody, delighting in him being out done with presents, not involving him in these decisions etc.", "NTA but you must realise that it would make dad feel some type of way.

Thanks for pinpointing that word :)", "They are hand held gaming systems so it\u2019s really not weird for each kid to have their own. My 7 year old has a Nintendo switch and I have one myself as well.", "K.", "Deleted comments disappear from your history. Reddit might be glitching and not letting them show up on this post.", "Baring him being a shitty parent, which she didn't really say anything about in the post, I think it's super gross for one parent to purposely try to take away time from the other parent. Assuming he's a good Dad and you want your kids to have a good relationship with him you should do 50/50. And hour is a bit of a hop but it isn't really that far.", "He prevented a more balanced custody arrangement by moving himself away. \n\nOP was the main caregiver before the divorce and remains that way because Kyle moved away.", "yup, she says step dad is a better dad than he ever was.  Well of course she thinks that he is spoiling them with expensive gifts.  Buying their love. And she says that dad needs to mind his own business about how they knew each other, Well he has every right to inquire since they were old friends.  Hes not slandering her he wants to be ensured that she in fact didnt cheat on him, which could change the outcome of custody.\n\nDad telling the kids to put away the toys that step dad bought is fair too. Since dad only gets limited time he wants to have that time.  Not the kids playing games.  He is trying to be a good dad and she is preventing it 100%\n\nShe is YTA", "I agree with you, this sounds to me very very manipulative", "Kids know that shit, though.  I'll bet they see right through Jeff and are using him.  If OP isn't careful they will resent her too for keeping them from their Dad and bad mouthing him.  \n\n\nBut I'm gonna go with INFO since I didn't see her comments and say it depends on whether she's making sure they get as much time from Kyle as possible and she only speaks kindly of him in their presence.", "I would agree if that was *all* he does for them, but it doesn't sound that way.", "unless I missed it, she doesn't say he moved an hour away. just that he lives an hour away. she could have been the one to move.", "No worries, everything else was perfect! I read it a few times and was confused before I realized, haha.", "I\u2019m going back and forth as idk if I have enough details to go one way or the other. But I will say I think the comment section is being way to hard on the SD. I from personal experience know what it\u2019s like to be a step parent. Sometimes you do use gifts as a way to connect. It\u2019s not about taking the place of their dad , but more so trying to find where his place is. I am not sure how long OP and SD have been married so that makes a difference as well. One thing I have learned though is in post divorces, in the paper work it will clearly state that when the kids are at one house the other parent does not have say, unless there is something illegal or harm coming to the children.", "I suppose my opinion comes from a place of having poor parents. The nintendo switch is also more versatile than a nintendo DS as it can be played by more than one person when docked at a TV. If they were each the lite version, I suppose I may have a different opinion.", "Easy way to test that theory, u/kanwic, if you want to delete your comment above and check if it's still showing in your comment history.", "Kids their ages can\u2019t live 50% of the time an hour away from their school and activities.", "Devils advocate, depending on location, Kyle may have not had a choice but to move away for himself due to jobs, housing, etc things that come along with divorce", "I agree she is the asshole cause I was gonna side with her untill I read her comments I really wanna hear the ex husband side of things.", "I do not know their situation so I won\u2019t assume but if I were to buy my other child once he is old enough he would have a lite just like his sister.", "Yeah so I wrote a comment (testing\u2026), saw it on my comment history, deleted and then it was no longer on my comment history u/kanwic is correct. Plus to add to their theory of Reddit glitching, I am on the actual app and keep having to exit and go back into posts due to it saying \u201csomething went wrong. Try again\u201d and it keeps randomly not allowing me to upvote or downvote comments", "I\u2019ve done it a few times in the ten years I\u2019ve been here. Removed comments will sometimes show for a while but self-deleted ones are gone. Reddit glitches or catches comments in filters all the time though.", "Do we know that Kyle is the one who moved an hour away? All I can see is that he lives an hour away. It could have been OP who moved and is then using that as an excuse not to share more custody time.  That might be a bit of a reach, but in this case I can also see it being plausible.", "And of course, to each their own, whatever works best for your family. :) I just wanted to put in my 2 cents and how I feel about it.", "[deleted]", "Yeah of course ! Lol a nice pleasant Reddit convo \ud83d\ude02 doesn\u2019t happen often", "Removed comments will still show up on your profile, not deleted ones.", "We need more care and compassion in the world so thanks for agreeing to disagree! \ud83d\ude1c"]}
