That must suck for him.  I feel for him and his relationship with his kids even more if you initiated the divorce, less if he's the reason.  Either way, it happened, and he needs to figure out his own place in his kids new lives.  You agreeing that the kids will keep their things at your place is a good compromise.  Not one that will work out well, I think, for Kyle in the long run, but one that shows your willingness to compromise now when co-parenting your kids.

I read your response to one of the comments, and your condescension for your ex is practically dripping. I thought it was just in the post. Your ex isn't wrong, your husband IS buying the kids' affections at this point. And you're really happy about it too, you want to replace your ex with your current husband. And he might take you to court for parental alienation. Which is what it feels like, reading this post. You're being awful to Kyle, he doesn't deserve it. He's their father, not your current husband. YTA", "I\u2019m going rogue and saying YTA. New gaming systems are generally a pretty big deal for kids, and while the two of us can afford to buy/replace gaming systems as soon as they come out for each house for our kid, we do not because we are on the same page with our parenting. \n\nThere are many solid reasons to not just buy your kids every little thing they want, regardless of income. And by telling Kyle he can spend money full bore on the kids, you\u2019re effectively throwing down the gauntlet for a competition to buy the kids affection. I get you\u2019re salty about the Jeff rumors, but don\u2019t let your pique translate into bad parenting.", "You put \"spoiling\" the kids in quotes and also wrote that the new guy's way of showing love is through giving.

Maybe he is trying to win their affection with material goods that dwarf what their dad can afford. \n\nSo maybe you are a bit of an asshole, and it should be you, not the ex, who should ask your husband to ease up a bit on the gift deluge, so the kids really aren't spoiled.", "It sounds to me like you enjoy bragging about the fact that you got married a man who makes more money, YTA", "YTA, you\u2019re flaunting new husband\u2019s money as if it were yours.

Though I'm also considering E S H (with the exception of Jeff, who just seems like a golden retriever of a person)\n\nKyle absolutely needs to work on his insecurities. If you're being 100% honest and you and Jeff didn't get back into contact until you were divorced, then it just feels like Kyle is trying to make up some sort of cheating story in his mind to excuse improving himself post-divorce. \"I wasn't the problem! I don't have anything to work on! She just cheated on me!\" and then started grasping at straws.\n\nI get it... parents get all competitive in this situation. But he's not even giving his kids enough credit to love him as a person, as their dad. He thinks his kids will only love whoever can buy them things. And he clearly doesn't think well enough of himself that his kids would still love him if he didn't spoil them. That being said...\n\nEven though he's being a jerk about it, I don't think it's constructive to entirely dismiss his insecurities. It's just going to escalate any bad vibes between you. Everyone struggles with insecurities so he shouldn't be treated like a crazy person for feeling like he's slipping out of his kids' life. So for that, I do need to ding you. Continue being firm, but don't be dismissive. After all, Kyle is still *trying* to be their dad which is a lot more than some divorced parents try to be. He's just going about it... clumsily.

You should be concerned about that also.\n\nJeff sucks because he's spoiling your kids and not respecting, or even acknowledging, the need for reasonable boundaries and thoughtfulness about it.\n\nYou suck, OP, because you are condescending and dismissive of Kyle's reasonable concerns, and are therefore blind to the real risk that Jeff's money will turn your kids into spoiled, entitled assholes (and that they will hate Kyle for trying to bring some appropriate balance into their lives).

Your kids are at a very vulnerable age right now, and tbh I think it\u2019s really shitty you aren\u2019t making more of an effort to let them see their dad more frequently. If you think he\u2019s a fine parent, why such resistance to 50/50. As a child of divorced parents, the single most important thing they did for us was shared custody. An hour drive is hard, but not too hard to give him only \u201cvisitation.\u201d He\u2019s trying really hard to stay in their lives, and now they have a new figure coming in with lavish gifts?

I\u2019d honestly be shocked if new guy\u2019s ploys with expensive gifts ISN\u2019T having the kids want to see their dad less because they have better toys with you.

I know if I\u2019m \u201cbitching\u201d about my ex it would be as you say \u201cdripping\u201d and condescending. If you have never been thru adverse relationship break up (divorce or long term partner cheating or abuse) then it comes off that way sometimes. It seems you went looking for something and found it", "I think she deleted it but it\u2019s still on her account.", "The goal of divorced  parents should be to make sure their children continue to have a good relationship with their parents while fostering a healthy relationship with any new family members.  It is not to try and replace their parent with a step parent. \n\n\n\nIf a parent loves their child they should understand that just because you dont love their other parent doesn't mean the kids dont or shouldn't.\n\n\n\nParental alienation is just evil.\n\n\n\nIf Op is doing that, she is TA big time.", "it does sound like Kyle\u2019s emasculated and insecure because his kids got presents from their step-dad.\n\nit\u2019s extremely normal to have family ( family friends in my case) who are rich and would buy expensive gifts. it\u2019s not a slight but people who have money - they also spend more money on others as they have disposable income ( there are of course cases where this is not the case*)", "That doesn't really sound very condescending, tbh.", "Yeah, read them on her profile. Just like I thought. She thinks she\u2019s sth better now cause she managed to latch onto a guy with money. Yet none of it is hers.", "I mean, Kyle arranged a talk to discuss his uncomfortableness with the gift giving. \n\nShe dismisses all of it and says it's just 'Jeffs love language', tells him he can buy gifts himself, then tries to lecture him on his insecurities. Like no shit lady, that's why he wanted to talk to you about it in the first place?\n\nShe sounds terrible at basic communication and compromise, so it's no wonder they're divorced. Kyles no better because he resorts to calling her a bitch, but only because he can't express himself - whereas she is probably much better at using her words to put him down.", "Go up to her username and click on it.

She\u2019s deleted them.", "This is a weird take", "It's not a weird age to have electronics.", "And she is extremely insulting to Kyle. She\u2019s something\u2026", "Ask how an unemployed mom will provide basic necessities - housing, meals.  Oh wait just find a rich new husband.", "Sure. A stay at home mom (or perhaps any mom) is gonna do better on those questions. But what about asking how far can they throw a ball, or what level they can beat on some videogame? Or what about asking the kid what custody arrangements they would prefer?", "That may well be the case, and OP may be an AH for various other reasons, but not for the content of this post.  As the facts are, the kids are being given gifts and treated well by the stepdad, he's spending his own money to do so, and she's the custodial parent who's allowing it.  Nothing about that is being an AH.  As for why she's got custody and he doesn't that's a matter for the courts, but even if they had 50/50 custody the stepdad wouldn't be an AH for giving the kids gifts in their own home.  So by the rules I had to vote as not TA, despite liking OP or not.", "Buying gifts for kids does not automatically make them spoiled. Kyle's issue also sounds like it has more to do with the fact that he thinks his wife got together with Jeff while they were still married. He needs to get over himself and trying to control the relationship his ex-wife has with Jeff, or that Jeff has with his kids. \n\nOP was honestly being nice to Kyle, and offered to have the kids leave their devices at home when they visit him. He then called her a bitch. He's 100% TA.", "That is ridiculous. You can't buy kids off, and no amount of money can help you replace the bio dad.", "An implication is not a smear campaign.

Parental alienation exists.", "That's because deleting comments removes them from the post, but the comment history in your account doesn't get deleted that way.", "She put spoiling in quotation marks which suggests she doesn't really think they're spoiled.", "To me, the quotes mean that she is mocking their dad for being concerned about that.", "If I didn\u2019t think my kids were being spoiled, I wouldn\u2019t use the word to describe how they\u2019re treated at home.", "Is that you Kyle? You seem way too personally invested.", "I\u2019m not invested at all. I\u2019ve just seen this game played so many times and it\u2019s wrong."]}
