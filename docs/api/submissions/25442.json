He's obviously some sort of addict and it sounds like this is just the last straw in a long line of shitty behavior.  You have every right to cut him out of your life.  Forgiving him would just be enabling his addiction and criminal behavior further.\n\nYou were a little extreme with your Mom, but I see where you're coming from.  She's babying and defending the artistic addict and trying to use his addiction as a reason why you should forgive and support him.  It doesn't work that way.  It can hurt a lot when you're the \"good son\" and yet you're the one that gets crapped on because the one that breaks the law is \"more vulnerable\".\n\nSet a clear boundary that you will not acknowledge or discuss your brother and anytime she tries you will hang up on her/leave the place (if in person).  No other ultimatum is needed.  Just hold firm and enforce your boundary.  Let her know you love her, but you will not get sucked into your brother's drama and trauma anymore.  You have to protect your wife and kids from his criminal activity.", "NTA - It doesn't sound like there is a point in your brother's life in which he isn't vulnerable and your mother is probably enabling his crappy behavior. Just because he is family does not mean he is automatically forgiven. In fact, it sounds like he missed the last stop on the train to redemption. I agree with cutting him out of your life and your mother is going to have to accept a new normal if she wants to maintain a relationship with you.

I think as a parent it\u2019s inherently difficult to stop enabling the behavior so I\u2019d cut some slack to your parents but remain firm on your boundaries.

If they start insisting that you forgive him and let bygones be bygones, then they're assholes bc redemption has to be earned.

Your wife is heartbroken and that is understandable.  I don't think it's ok to try to force people to choose in this situation.  I have a similar situation with a cousin.  I have been NC with him since 2016.  I don't force that on anyone, even my children.  They can make their own choices, they are individuals.  I think it would be different if there were violence involved, but under these circumstances I think you are wrong to tell your mom to choose between you.  It's impossible to do as a parent.

It's easier said than done, but here is my advice take it how you wish. I grew up with a druggie brother and a very physically abusive father. In that, I have a metal arm, and my brother stole things that can never be replaced. He's clean now and has fixed his life at the age of 43. Anyways, I say this as a person who was angry and bitter. Forgive, but don't forget that doesn't mean to let him back into your life, not at all. But for your own sake, do not dwell on it, and don't let him live rent-free in your head. Consider the sculpture as a good thing now, you know, to cut him out of your life. Don't become bitter over it. It took you that sculpture to realize who your family is, and that's a godsend at this point before he does something extremely heartbreaking.

As hard as it may be, the best thing for everyone, especially him, would be to cut contact.", "NTA.  Report it stolen.", "NTA, fuck with my wife and I\u2019ll fuck with your life. Simple as", "We're only allowed to put one judgment in the comment so I have to say NTA, but there are two conflicts here. Cutting your brother out of your life is justified because you need to protect your family, but from the information provided in this story your ultimatum towards your mother was completely unwarranted.", "BUT, if he is an addict, he has a disease. Addicts aren\u2019t bad people, they are sick people.  As someone in recovery I can tell you that I am nothing like the person I used to be, and I have to carry the shame and guilt of that sick shit.   \n\nIf he is able to get clean, please consider forgiving him.", "This. My father's mother was a really bad alcoholic while he was growing up. I don't really know all the stories. He doesn't talk about it much. But when she was in the hospital, dying, and wanted to see him and us, he refused. I never saw my grandmother, who had sobered up years before, before she died. Only saw her a handful of times when she was alive. I still have some resentment in me from that. From being denied saying goodbye to a family member. He regrets it now, too. Not for himself but for us.\n\nDon't make your children choose. When they are old enough, support their decision to learn about their family members themselves. Regardless of how you felt or feel about them.", "NC with parents is a bit over the top don't you think? At least you don't have enough information to reach that conclusion.", "> got out of rehab for the millionth time\n\nGuess", "Purely conjecture, but I assume that the people who he didn't pay in full beat him up. Especially since debt was mentioned as an issue.", "How is this not higher? I guess everyone was too busy whipping up a hate mob to be curious", "I remember a cop friend telling me about a mom trying to protect her son from being arrested for beating his wife so badly she was in a coma. Because a \"mother's love is unconditional\". Bullshit.", "I love that you frame confronting a lying addict who just committed a crime as \"harassment\".", "Right, he didn\u2019t do anything. Except lie. And steal. And deeply hurt OPs wife. And then play victim. And then run crying to mummy like a bloody child.", ">YTA imo as you're still assuming he's not making something else for her.\n\n\n\nOh, let's stop this noise. \n\nHe sold the very item he was supposed to fix. They don't want a new one. They want that one. Not a new one. \n\n\n\nYou:\n\n>You're even calling it a shitty piece of art, if my brother in law made such a comment... \n\n\nOP's brother:\n\n>He was at our house a month ago and he saw his sculpture. He said that he was embarrassed by how shitty it was compared to what he makes now. \n\n\nSo he acknowledged that his work was embarrassing to him. He had the issue first.", "So it is too much effort for her not to use his name?", "Mom confronted OP and put herself in the middle of it. What a weird take.", "OP didn\u2019t put mother in the middle of it. She had done it herself.", "Yes, his lovely, kind, trusting, forgiving wife\u2026 or his lying, thieving, selfish, addict brother. However shall he choose?", "Well, the brother betrayed the trust of OP\u2019s wife. And mother is supporting that.\n\nSo both clearly don\u2019t care for family.", "This is a great idea. I know it can be hard for new artists to break into the art world even when they are amazing. Maybe you and your wife can do that for someone.", "[removed]", "You should post about this situation on legal advice. You can\u2019t get blood from a stone as they say, but you can at least get a judgment against him.", "Your children don\u2019t need to be hurt or have their mother hurt by him. Having grown up with an addict I can assure you they know more than you think they do. Good luck and stay firm in your decision, turning a blind eye is giving permission.", "You seem to be thinking very clearly to me, op. You're protecting your family, which is your wife, not the brother who severed those ties. You're not even asking your mother to sever ties, just to never speak of him to you because HIS actions severed those ties.\ud83e\udd14 NTA in any way, shape, form, or fashion. May you and your wife heal and thrive.", "Exactly. You\u2019re a good man and husband.", "I think that's part of the problem your, and really most, family has. It's an obsessive notion that \"relative = family\". But it doesn't. I have some relatives I will never see again and honestly never think about. i have friends who are actually family. \n\nThe moment we stop obsessively worshiping the notion of blood relation, is the moment a LOT of this crap stops being enabled in my opinion.", "Thank the amazing Carnac, he had soooo many of those.  https://www.nightscribe.com/Politics/carnacquotes.htm", "He didn\u2019t scream at his brother; his mother screamed at him. And I think telling addicts what their behavior costs them is important and needs to be said, so I don\u2019t think he was wrong to do that. Everyone sounds emotionally invested - except the brother - but OP sounds livid enough to torpedo his relationship with his parents.", "Yes, let's not jump to NC.\n\nOP has most likely dealt with his brother shitty behavior all his life.\n\nBut hey, we shouldn't be so quick to cut him off. He has 30+ years that he could endure lies, crime and manipulation. The poor brother needs a break, right?", "I mean, doing bad things doesn't mean  they aren't loved.  That mom may still love her son even if she doesn't agree with what he did.", "The dude was in the hospital, so if there was no need to go down there at that time, yes, its harassment. \n\nJust because someone did something wrong, doesn't mean someone else's behavior isn't harassing them.", "Fair I mean I guess that's a bit better but it's still just the threat... at penalty of not getting to see her grandkids? Why involve them. \n\nAnyhow it just seems like you're punishing the wrong person. \n\nYou're totally fair to be done with your brother it's just taking it out on others that I don't think is warranted.", "You asked for peoples opinion and take it personally when they disagree completely with you.\n\nTheres no reason for you to be mad if there was no money involved you wouldn't be mad.\n\nPeople when theres 15k in the middle change completely I saw another horrible post about 15k just now ,\n\nThe girlfriend gambled her boyfriends 100 dollars which he gave cause he wanted her to have fun too made 15k , didn't give him half and broke up with him , when money gets involved people get weird.", "There was nothing said about \u201cfixing\u201d. The artist/sculptor could just make a whole new piece.\n\nIm an artist and have gifted/lent siblings artworks of that value. The explicitly kind thing to do (in his desperate case) would\u2019ve been to be upfront about wanting to sell an older sculpture but with the promise of replacing it with something new. Hell it could even be more reflective of their sibling relationship than his past addictions. \n\nI am not on OPs side, they are neglecting this artists circumstances and the full picture of the gesture being to make something new for his sibling. I doubt the argument would even be here if the artist had gifted something new before selling the old one.", ">Making the kids choose is to extreme.\n\nYeah, what if the kids chose their grandma lol", "Bot", "Uh OK but is no one going to call OP on being an asshole re: involving his kids in his ultimatum? To me this is very obvious asshole behavior, even if it comes from a place of exhaustion and grief:\n\n> if she ever mentioned him to me again I would tell my kids to choose between her and me. \n\nHow old are his kids? Do they know OP's history with his brother and their parents? Does that history affect their relationship with their grandparents? Does OP *really* intend to one day tell his kids, \"Grandma mentioned your uncle to me, so if you don't tell her she's dead to you, *you're* dead to *me*\"? Jesus Fuck.", "I'm not sure OP would want it back, it's not the sculpture that's the issue, it's the betrayal, and it would be a continual reminder of it.", "They need a police report for it.", "Lawyer here. Getting an irrecoverable judgment is honestly a waste of time, money, and resources.", "The DA doesn\u2019t even need to be smart. I\u2019m a former criminal defense attorney, and cutting a brake line is pretty textbook attempted murder. (A DA would charge multiple offenses in case a jury thought attempted murder was a stretch, so there\u2019d almost certainly still be a conviction.)", "It had nothing to do with old work crap. He saw a sucker and was able to steal it!", "Maurizio Castel\u00e1n is your brother?!! Wow. Press charges, get that art work back. Forgive me for saying this, but when he dies, that $15k piece will be worth a lot more!  Your wife Can later sell it and do charity work or what ever she wants with it!!!

Going off the info given and not doing reddit sleuthing of what may or may not be.", "This is a straw that broke the camels back situation, if it was the first offence then forgive but bro has been ducking up for years and OP is done. They are entitled to not want to know/hear anything about someone who\u2019s has repeatedly hurt them", "I don't know your situation but maybe you don't understand the dynamics of parents with vastly different children. My brother was an addict and my mom defending him to death. You know what resulted in her constantly forgiving him and defending him? All my dad's life insurance money being stolen, along with one of his cars, leaving my mom penniless and having to move in with me. That was followed by him tracking me down 12 years later after my mom died then assaulting me to a bloody pulp looking for HER life insurance. I had to call the cops, get a restraining order, move out of my apartment and into a hotel, and leave all my stuff behind because I couldn't go back there because one night he sent his girlfriend and friend over there who tried to break in. I basically had to start my life entirely over and it wasn't cheap. So in a way he stole much of her life insurance from me anyways. It's insane that you would say HE's the one torching relationships. It's his f\\*cking brother with the gasoline and matches in his hand.", "Buddy, you said that it\u2019s a good thing that OP\u2019s wife is suffering now because this makes her understand OP\u2019s perspective.\n\nHow was OP not supposed to feel this personally?\n\nYou are essentially saying that it\u2019s a good thing that the wife was hurt.", "And there goes the guilt trip. \n\nWhy do you guys always assume that, somewhere down the line, cutting off an abusive or toxic family member is going to cause you regret?\n\nIt\u2019s like saying that someone should keep the parasite in their intestines just because you might regret removing it one day.", "I hear you. But if this guy actually is selling his pieces for $15k, won\u2019t he have money to pay it back in the future?", "That sounds more like a sociopath than just abusive.", "It's hard to fathom how rich some people are.\nUnfortunately only rich families like this people can actually pursue these alternatives careers and fail over and over again until they get it", "And if the mechanic sold your car to someone else you would be fine with that? Brother had zero intention of giving her something new.", "Nonsense. You expect the mechanic to fix your own car, not suddenly swap it out for a subjectively \"better\" one.", "I totally hear you. People don't know what the hell they are talking about. They don't understand what it's like to have a constant screw up addict sibling with a mom who constantly defends them.", "Dude that's your story.\n\nAll OP mentioned is a stolen sculpture. Not violence or theft against his family. That's obviously a different situation.", "Really that's what I said?\nWhere was she hurt exactly ?", "Wouldn\u2019t reporting it stolen be able to bring the statue back though?", "If prosecuted and convicted the brother could end up in prison for a while, and that may be the wake-up call he needs to get clean.  Part of making an addict hit rock bottom so his life sucks and he wants to change is ensuring he feels the full negative consequences of his actions.\n\nIf the only repercussion for him stealing is that his brother is mad, his brother and mother stop talking, and he paid of $15k in debts, he'll just steal from someone else because he got away with it the last time.", "Buying stolen merchandise is a crime. You have to return it to the rightful owner.", "He might!  But it sounds like OP doesn\u2019t need the money, and litigation is always stressful and generally sucky.", "He died laughing, I'm sure!", "It has a lot of money laundering.  Art still is a skill and some is worth more then others based on factors.", "Why aren't you exoring why your eifevliked him so much in the first place...\nI think your a tad too trusting...", "These debates are conjecture unless we know what kind of material it is.
