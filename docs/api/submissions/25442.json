He's obviously some sort of addict and it sounds like this is just the last straw in a long line of shitty behavior.  You have every right to cut him out of your life.  Forgiving him would just be enabling his addiction and criminal behavior further.\n\nYou were a little extreme with your Mom, but I see where you're coming from.  She's babying and defending the artistic addict and trying to use his addiction as a reason why you should forgive and support him.  It doesn't work that way.  It can hurt a lot when you're the \"good son\" and yet you're the one that gets crapped on because the one that breaks the law is \"more vulnerable\".\n\nSet a clear boundary that you will not acknowledge or discuss your brother and anytime she tries you will hang up on her/leave the place (if in person).  No other ultimatum is needed.  Just hold firm and enforce your boundary.  Let her know you love her, but you will not get sucked into your brother's drama and trauma anymore.  You have to protect your wife and kids from his criminal activity.", "NTA - It doesn't sound like there is a point in your brother's life in which he isn't vulnerable and your mother is probably enabling his crappy behavior. Just because he is family does not mean he is automatically forgiven. In fact, it sounds like he missed the last stop on the train to redemption. I agree with cutting him out of your life and your mother is going to have to accept a new normal if she wants to maintain a relationship with you.

I think as a parent it\u2019s inherently difficult to stop enabling the behavior so I\u2019d cut some slack to your parents but remain firm on your boundaries.

If they start insisting that you forgive him and let bygones be bygones, then they're assholes bc redemption has to be earned.

You should speak to your parents and tell them that it broke your trust and belief in him, what he did to you guys. Your parents shouldn't have tried to inch into the situation, but they aren't who you are actually upset with.

Just my two cents.", "[deleted]", "You're not the asshole for being livid.  YTA for turning on the rest of your mother (and presumable everyone else that chooses not to write him off).  Your wife is heartbroken and that is understandable.  I don't think it's ok to try to force people to choose in this situation.  I have a similar situation with a cousin.  I have been NC with him since 2016.  I don't force that on anyone, even my children.  They can make their own choices, they are individuals.  I think it would be different if there were violence involved, but under these circumstances I think you are wrong to tell your mom to choose between you.  It's impossible to do as a parent.  I could never adhere to your ultimatum under the circumstances you described if you were my sons.

It's easier said than done, but here is my advice take it how you wish. I grew up with a druggie brother and a very physically abusive father. In that, I have a metal arm, and my brother stole things that can never be replaced. He's clean now and has fixed his life at the age of 43. Anyways, I say this as a person who was angry and bitter. Forgive, but don't forget that doesn't mean to let him back into your life, not at all. But for your own sake, do not dwell on it, and don't let him live rent-free in your head. Consider the sculpture as a good thing now, you know, to cut him out of your life. Don't become bitter over it. It took you that sculpture to realize who your family is, and that's a godsend at this point before he does something extremely heartbreaking.
