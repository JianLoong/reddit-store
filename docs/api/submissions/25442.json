Her sculpture is one of the very first ones he made after he got out of rehab for the millionth time. \n\nHe was at our house a month ago and he saw his sculpture. He said that he was embarrassed by how shitty it was compared to what he makes now. He asked if he could take it and rework it to make it better. \n\nMy wife agreed because she is an amazing and trusting woman. \n\nHe sold it. He sold it for $15,000 which wasn't enough to pay off the people that he owed money to. He could have asked me for the money and I would have paid it. Instead he broke my wife's heart and I fucking hate home for doing that. \n\nI went to see him in the hospital and told him he was dead to me and to never come near my family again. \n\nMy mom called me to scream at me for putting more stress on him when he is in such a vulnerable point in his life. I told her that if she ever mentioned him to me again I would tell my kids to choose between her and me. \n\nI know it seems extreme but you have not idea what this did to my wife. \n\nMy father called me to talk about it and said my mother was inconsolable. I told him that his other son stole not just a shitty piece of art but my wife's belief in his redemption.

He's obviously some sort of addict and it sounds like this is just the last straw in a long line of shitty behavior.  You have every right to cut him out of your life.  Forgiving him would just be enabling his addiction and criminal behavior further.\n\nYou were a little extreme with your Mom, but I see where you're coming from.  She's babying and defending the artistic addict and trying to use his addiction as a reason why you should forgive and support him.  It doesn't work that way.  It can hurt a lot when you're the \"good son\" and yet you're the one that gets crapped on because the one that breaks the law is \"more vulnerable\".\n\nSet a clear boundary that you will not acknowledge or discuss your brother and anytime she tries you will hang up on her/leave the place (if in person).  No other ultimatum is needed.  Just hold firm and enforce your boundary.  Let her know you love her, but you will not get sucked into your brother's drama and trauma anymore.  You have to protect your wife and kids from his criminal activity.", "NTA - It doesn't sound like there is a point in your brother's life in which he isn't vulnerable and your mother is probably enabling his crappy behavior. Just because he is family does not mean he is automatically forgiven. In fact, it sounds like he missed the last stop on the train to redemption. I agree with cutting him out of your life and your mother is going to have to accept a new normal if she wants to maintain a relationship with you. Your parents may feel like they signed up for this and are obligated to deal with it, but you and your wife sure as hell did not.", "NTA. I had brothers and was nearly killed when I fell through an attic that my brother deliberately made me fall through, then when the brake line was cut on my car and I almost hit an 18 wheeler. My mom excused because \"family\"", "NTA Addiction in the family means you have to set boundaries. I have a brother who\u2019s an addict and I\u2019m working through the same thing with my Mom. I think as a parent it\u2019s inherently difficult to stop enabling the behavior so I\u2019d cut some slack to your parents but remain firm on your boundaries. He cannot contact you or your family and they need to respect your wishes. If they continue to push it then perhaps some boundaries with them but I wouldn\u2019t totally cut contact.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nBut, if your family is anything like mine was, prepare for escalation.\n\nI'm talking ambushes, be it your home, your place of work, or even your children's school. Harassment of not only you, but your wife and children too.\nAnd in worse cases, physical assault.\n\nIt took me moving to an other country to finally gain a semblance of peace. \n\nDo whatever you need to keep your nuclear family safe.", "NTA for going no contact, but maybe take it easy on your parents and kids. If they start insisting that you forgive him and let bygones be bygones, then they're assholes bc redemption has to be earned. I'd suggest pologizing for being mean to your parents, but stick your ground on cutting the brother off. He needs to learn that hurting people means losing people.", "NTA\n\nProbably won't get any money but I'd still sue him over this.", "I understand you are heartbroken and angry, he took something special from you guys. He shouldn't have sold the sculpture, and that was wrong, but I don't think it warrants a \"you're dead to me.\" \n\nYou should have him personally apologize to your wife and offer to create something personalized for her if he still can. I would understand if you didn't speak to him for a while as well, I wouldn't either. You should speak to your parents and tell them that it broke your trust and belief in him, what he did to you guys. Your parents shouldn't have tried to inch into the situation, but they aren't who you are actually upset with. I can't tell you to cut off your family or not, but it doesn't seem like your parents had bad intentions in trying to talk to you, they just went about it wrong. Just my two cents.", "ESH\n\nHe was wrong, yes, he stole a treasured piece of work and flipped it for his own gain. However, he\u2019s also not thinking straight himself and obviously in a dark and desperate place.\n\nIf you would\u2019ve helped him before he stole, the right thing to do would be to still help him, even if he stole from you out of desperation. \n\nAfter all, he is the artist, yeah? So have him repay you with a new sculpture, a recreation of the original he sold off. Free of charge, it\u2019s repayment for his wrong action. Not the same, but it\u2019s the thought that counts, because what is done is done.\n\nTake it from someone who\u2019s buried a lot of family members, mate, a couple of them were addicts that tried and failed and tried again, but ultimately fell to their depression and addiction. I may be biased in my experience, but there\u2019s my input all the same. \n\nMaybe the compassionate route doesn\u2019t seem like the best right now, but please do not give up on your family over a materialistically-rooted issue.", "You're not the asshole for being livid.  YTA for turning on the rest of your mother (and presumable everyone else that chooses not to write him off).  Your wife is heartbroken and that is understandable.  I don't think it's ok to try to force people to choose in this situation.  I have a similar situation with a cousin.  I have been NC with him since 2016.  I don't force that on anyone, even my children.  They can make their own choices, they are individuals.  I think it would be different if there were violence involved, but under these circumstances I think you are wrong to tell your mom to choose between you.  It's impossible to do as a parent.  I could never adhere to your ultimatum under the circumstances you described if you were my sons.  I would respect your choice to be NC and you need to give her the time to respect your decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Cutting the brake line in your car?? Like in the movies?? Surely, that\u2019s illegal", "Not worth it.", "It sounds like this is the pointy end of a long series of betrayals and failures from the brother, if he's been in and out of rehab that often.

I think the name thing is still extreme.  I think you should make it clear you don't want to speak of him or be around when others do.  If you want to go so far as to say you will not be around and/or will leave if others talk about him around you that is still kind of extreme but acceptable.  See how you feel about it after a while.  Your strong stance might even make things worse for your wife.", "Why does he have to go somewhere else because he doesn't want to sue his brother?
