He's obviously some sort of addict and it sounds like this is just the last straw in a long line of shitty behavior.  You have every right to cut him out of your life.  Forgiving him would just be enabling his addiction and criminal behavior further.\n\nYou were a little extreme with your Mom, but I see where you're coming from.  She's babying and defending the artistic addict and trying to use his addiction as a reason why you should forgive and support him.  It doesn't work that way.  It can hurt a lot when you're the \"good son\" and yet you're the one that gets crapped on because the one that breaks the law is \"more vulnerable\".\n\nSet a clear boundary that you will not acknowledge or discuss your brother and anytime she tries you will hang up on her/leave the place (if in person).  No other ultimatum is needed.  Just hold firm and enforce your boundary.  Let her know you love her, but you will not get sucked into your brother's drama and trauma anymore.  You have to protect your wife and kids from his criminal activity.", "NTA - It doesn't sound like there is a point in your brother's life in which he isn't vulnerable and your mother is probably enabling his crappy behavior. Just because he is family does not mean he is automatically forgiven. In fact, it sounds like he missed the last stop on the train to redemption. I agree with cutting him out of your life and your mother is going to have to accept a new normal if she wants to maintain a relationship with you. Your parents may feel like they signed up for this and are obligated to deal with it, but you and your wife sure as hell did not.", "NTA.

My mom excused because \"family\"", "NTA Addiction in the family means you have to set boundaries. I have a brother who\u2019s an addict and I\u2019m working through the same thing with my Mom. I think as a parent it\u2019s inherently difficult to stop enabling the behavior so I\u2019d cut some slack to your parents but remain firm on your boundaries. He cannot contact you or your family and they need to respect your wishes.

If they start insisting that you forgive him and let bygones be bygones, then they're assholes bc redemption has to be earned. I'd suggest pologizing for being mean to your parents, but stick your ground on cutting the brother off. He needs to learn that hurting people means losing people.", "NTA\n\nProbably won't get any money but I'd still sue him over this.", "I understand you are heartbroken and angry, he took something special from you guys. He shouldn't have sold the sculpture, and that was wrong, but I don't think it warrants a \"you're dead to me.\" \n\nYou should have him personally apologize to your wife and offer to create something personalized for her if he still can. I would understand if you didn't speak to him for a while as well, I wouldn't either. You should speak to your parents and tell them that it broke your trust and belief in him, what he did to you guys. Your parents shouldn't have tried to inch into the situation, but they aren't who you are actually upset with. I can't tell you to cut off your family or not, but it doesn't seem like your parents had bad intentions in trying to talk to you, they just went about it wrong. Just my two cents.", "[deleted]", "You're not the asshole for being livid.  YTA for turning on the rest of your mother (and presumable everyone else that chooses not to write him off).  Your wife is heartbroken and that is understandable.  I don't think it's ok to try to force people to choose in this situation.  I have a similar situation with a cousin.  I have been NC with him since 2016.  I don't force that on anyone, even my children.  They can make their own choices, they are individuals.  I think it would be different if there were violence involved, but under these circumstances I think you are wrong to tell your mom to choose between you.  It's impossible to do as a parent.  I could never adhere to your ultimatum under the circumstances you described if you were my sons.  I would respect your choice to be NC and you need to give her the time to respect your decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife feels betrayed as well she was cheering him along. sadly.\nNow this I would suggest just because I went through a similar situation, and I learned the hard way. It's easier said than done, but here is my advice take it how you wish. I grew up with a druggie brother and a very physically abusive father. In that, I have a metal arm, and my brother stole things that can never be replaced. He's clean now and has fixed his life at the age of 43. Anyways, I say this as a person who was angry and bitter. Forgive, but don't forget that doesn't mean to let him back into your life, not at all. But for your own sake, do not dwell on it, and don't let him live rent-free in your head. Consider the sculpture as a good thing now, you know, to cut him out of your life. Don't become bitter over it. It took you that sculpture to realize who your family is, and that's a godsend at this point before he does something extremely heartbreaking. You can always get your wife sculpting classes so she can make something of her own, and you can cheer her on, and it would be even more sentimental. <3", "Fantastic response, and super helpful... am in a similar situation with a family member.", "WHAT????", "Agree.

Just that's what brother said to get ops wife to allow him to take it back.\n\nThat said I'm going to say that a lot of artists are insecure.

I just added that bro will likely end up in prison soon anyways.", "Make it a demolition project and call the remains \"broken family\"", "Get it back, sell it, treat wife to holiday...", "I would probably still let the buyer know. If this is a habit for brother there are consequences to buying stolen art, that's why there is specific paperwork for high cost pieces.
