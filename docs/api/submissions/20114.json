{"id": 20114, "submission_id": "14dx01m", "title": "AITA for wanting to kick my mother-in-law out for how she handled the loss of her husband?", "selftext": "I (45F) and my husband (47M) live with my husband's mother, and our three kids, aged 6, 13, and 16. I am a hard working mother who has a stable job at an office, making around 80k a year. My mother in law has always resented me and has never told me thank you or appreciated anything I've done. We have let her live with us at no charge many times in these past 10 years, and yet she never shows any appreciation towards me or even tries to speak positively about me.  \n\n\n4 months ago, my father in law passed away due to sickness in a different country. Me and my family had to leave the country to go to his funeral and see my mother in law, who was completely distraught over the loss of her husband. I showed her much sympathy for the entire week, cooking for her and supporting her whenever she needed to let it all out. Even so, she had never appreciated my efforts or told me thank you for helping her.  \n\n\nAt the end of the trip, she asked if she could come back to the US and stay with our family. Me and my husband both accepted this, as we have a large house with an extra room and space for her to stay. We told her she could stay with us for as long as she needed to grieve. For the first 2 months, she was coping with the loss smoothly, me and my husband and my two older children constantly talked to her so she didn't feel alone. We cooked for her, helped her clean, and even offered for her to go on some outings with us, which she never accepted. Dealing with a loss can be a long process for some, so I didn't mind it and let her stay in peace.  \n\n\nNow, my only problems have began to come up these last few weeks. She has begun to talk to my 6 year old son about the loss of his grandfather, which we have tried to sugarcoat due to him being so young and not quite understanding it. Sometimes, she will sit with him while he's watching TV and start talking about the death to him, which even brings him to tears sometimes since he still doesn't actually know what has really happened. We've told her many times to not project it onto him, but she continues to do it.  \n\n\nShe is also coming into the room of my 13 year old daughter in the night and just standing and staring at her. She sometimes walks over and touches her, even though my daughter hates being touched by everyone including her family. Again, we've told her this but the message isn't getting through to her. My husband has tried to talk to her as she needs to control herself, especially around his children, but she claims that it's not her, it's the other version of her.  \n\n\nShe has bad-mouthed me to many people, and I'm currently receiving backlash from some family memebers who are claiming that I'm shaming my mother-in-law for grieving, even though I have never said that at all. I would never shame anyone for coping, but I feel like the way she dislikes me and the way she's projecting her grief onto my children, especially my 6 year old son, is just really getting to me.", "created_utc": 1687224323, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dx01m/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_my_motherinlaw_out_for/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By withholding the information when it\u2019s obvious that something has happened, you are instilling anxiety in him about the unknown, and are implicitly communicating the message that whatever happened is too scary for him to be able to cope with.

This sounds like potentially some form of psychosis, which can happen with grief sometimes. OP NTA but I think you (actually your husband) need to get her to see a doctor.\n\nEdit: Also as a mother your most important job is to protect your children, not MIL. If she keeps doing stuff like this and you keep her in the same house as your children, hurting them or worse, then you would be an AH.", "In many countries parents go visit their children that live abroad for months at the time, that\u2019s probably what she means", "I was suspect about this as well. Doesn't make sense.", "It sounds like they DID explain it to him - but MIL is harping on it to the point it's upsetting. So no, it's not OP who is upsetting her son.", "OP said the 6 yo still doesn\u2019t know what really happened.", "She says they 'sugarcoated it'. Which likely means something to the effect of telling him that grandpa died, but not going into how he got sick and that caused him to die, etc. There is zero benefit in allowing a 6yo to start thinking things like \"What if the next time I get a cold, I die?\"\n\nThat's part of the 'age appropriate' limits you yourself mentioned. Sugarcoating death is 'age appropriate' for 6yo.", "Lots of child development experts would disagree with your approach.  But keeping what happened so vague, the child is left with no idea why the death happened, which makes it feel like a random thing that could happen at any time with no wanting (which it can, but as we agree, it should be kept age-appropriate).  Depending on how he died, there are age-appropriate ways to communicate what happened that won\u2019t leave the 6 yo afraid he (or his parents) will be next.  For instance, if he died of cancer or another illness, part of the explanation can be that his body was very old and therefore not strong enough to fight off the illness.  \n\nBut more generally, kids tend to do best when you follow their lead.  If the 6 yo has questions about what happened to his grandfather, then his parents should be answering those questions.  You give a simple, straightforward, age-appropriate answer, and then see what the child has to say about it.  If they have more questions, you answer them.  If not, then you\u2019ve likely reached the limits of what they are emotionally prepared to handle.  \n\nIf OP\u2019s son is in tears over this, he probably has questions that need to be answered.", "You're tossing in a whole hell of a lot of assumptions about what OP said or didn't say to her son. OP told him what she felt he could handle for his age and his personal development. Grandma is oversharing to a disturbing extent.\n\nYour armchair-quarterbacking of what OP shared is, frankly, quite weird when you've never met her, her son, or even read an accounting of what was actually said.\n\nAnd it's not at all relevant to the post, either."]}
