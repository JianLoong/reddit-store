She wants a future with you but there might not be one if you don\u2019t quit smoking. She did it and knows how hard it is and is trying to support you to be healthy. If you continue smoking you will miss out on the future. My dad was a 20 year smoker and it caught up to him after another 20 years. He died from small cell lung cancer due to his smoking. Quit now and get ct scans as you age for preventative care", "YTA. You put in the comments that you\u2019re in your 30s. This paints the story in a very different light. Your response to her concern was childish. Since when is being concerned about your partner slowly poisoning themselves lame?", "YTA: She clearly cares about you and wants you to be healthy and live a long life. Ignoring the facts about smoking and the long term health implications isn't the smartest idea, so perhaps you should listen to her.", "YTA \n\nYou couldn't have approached that conversation like a grown up? She's bringing up real and valid concerns about your future together and your health. She didn't do it in the best way but your response was childish", "YTA, maybe it's cliche but she's telling you that she cares about you and wants to be with you for a long time. It's like if you proposed to her and she called you lame.", "INFO: What are your ages?", "YTA. She wants a partner who cares enough about their health to be around as long as possible. You mocked her for it. Sounds like y\u2019all aren\u2019t compatible.", "How is it lame to want a future with you? Cliche? No no what she wants is fine and normal and you had to be mean?\n\nHard yta", "YTA - Name calling is for assholes", "YTA and too immature to be in a relationship.", "YTA she needs to leave your ass", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The new information from her speech was that she's thinking about a long term future with you, and she wants you to stay healthy. Your response makes me wonder if you value your gf, and also if you really like/love yourself. You're far from the biggest YTA on this sub but I hope you take some time to think about this situation.", "Info: when in the convo did she tell you to quit cold turkey?", "I mean, ngl I would find that cheesy although most of my gender loves that shit, but she wants you to be alive- which is fair, so NAH", "Yta . It\u2019s nothing worth than a self aware addict. \u201cI know I\u2019ll die so what\u201d like it\u2019s so lame and I hope she leaves you with someone who does want a future", "YTA.  Please advise your gf that reddit thinks she can do better.", "YTA, just by the immaturity in your post. You said yourself that she was right", "I agree, being in a relationship with someone who acts like you is pretty lame. \n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nYou don't talk an addict into not being an addict.   You quit when you're actually ready to quit and anyone trying to bully or sweet talk you into it is just wasting their breath.", "YTA. Quit smoking.", "She probably didn\u2019t realize those things were obvious to you considering the fact that anyone that DOES know those things and still chooses to smoke is nothing but a massive, useless asshole. YTA.", "NAH. Don\u2019t date smokers if you don\u2019t want them to smoke.", "Yta- i question some emotional maturity here to be honest. Sure it was \" cliche\" but it was coming from a real place for her, real concerns and her very real hopes for your shared future\n\nYou also keep using the excuse of \" its an addiction\" . Thats an explanation not an excuse to not get help like you seem to be using it.\n\nI've had these conversations with my father whose reacted the way you have and its hurtful but also its leading to some real consequences for him. Medical advice is to not let 2nd or 3rd hand smoke around infants so when he can't hold his grandson in a few weeks it will be heartbreaking", "NAH if she wants you to quit smoking she just should\u2019ve started with that. \n\nI think a lot of the Y T A are coming from people who dislike smokers. I smoke weed not cigarettes but I think people should do as they please. \n\nShe was also a smoker and you didn\u2019t make her quit she stopped for her own reasons. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a conversation asking you to stop but the whole story leading to it is a lot and not necessarily needed. Just have the talk. \n\nI also don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve called her lame", "YTA\n\nJust because it's a clich\u00e9 doesn't mean it's not true or sincere. And sometimes knowing something can be different than hearing the person you love say it. Just because it didn't end up having a personal impact on you doesn't mean it was cool to dismiss her feelings or act like she was stupid for telling you things you already know deep down.", "YTA. she sat you down to have a serious talk with you and you acted like a skater kid from a shitty sitcom in the 90s. you\u2019re a grown man. get your shit together", "YTA\nShe is bringing up a real issue with serious consequences, and you acted like her concerns are stupid.", "Okay addiction and logic don\u2019t always agree. Her response was gold though", "It was", "It was sweet but ending it the way she did just cheapen the whole thing.", "32m 33f", "Nta, just curious about the name calling he's doing.... was there an edit?", "Yeah that\u2019s why I thought I might have been the asshole.", "Thank you sir! She comes from a family of addicts to and knows this. My initial response should of been better though.", "I don't know why this comment is getting downvoted. I'm an addict, and this is exactly right. \n\nEvery addict, in the course of being an addict, has gotten twelve million lectures that weren't in the least helpful.", "You should understand that saying \u201cit\u2019s an addiction therefore I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d is also the addiction talking.", "You cheapened it by calling her \u201clame\u201d. You\u2019re in your 30s. What\u2019s your excuse?", "The ending was the whole point.", "It didn't cheapen it.\n\nIt made you feel uncomfortable, because you don't want to change. \n\nThat's *your* fault, not the results of her \"cheapening\" it. She was heartfelt and genuine and *vulnerable*, and you were an AH.", "Well she isn't wrong...so who cares if it's cheap.", "You think it's lame to talk about quitting smoking at 33?\n\nDude, and I say this as a smoker, it is time to grow up. \n\nShe's telling you she doesn't see a future with someone who's still smoking. You're not listening, and instead laughing about it. If you want to see a future with her, you need to think about your priorities and have a grown up conversation instead of reacting like a teenager.", "YTA. Maybe she was a little bit cliche about it, but she obviously cares about you, and you responded like a sulky teen.", " No I just called her lame", "Yes", "100% my thought. I was expecting OP to reply with 18/19. YTA.", "I know but it just cheapened everything she said.", "So stop using it as a crutch. Quitting smoking is not hopeless because you\u2019re addicted. Your cruelty toward your partner should be a wake up call\u2026", "And there is help all over the place for it...", "The ending didn\u2019t cheapen what she said, you just didn\u2019t like it. First step is admitting that you don\u2019t want to quit smoking and have no intention of quitting. Don\u2019t lie to your GF, don\u2019t lie to yourself", "I fail to see how. She was asking you to quit in a heartfelt way and being vulnerable about where she was coming from. \n\nMaybe you don't feel like you're in a place to quit right now, that doesn't make you an asshole. It might make you incompatible since for many people smoking is a dealbreaker, but doesn't make you an asshole. But huge YTA for your reaction to her and allowing your defensiveness to see what she was saying in the most uncharitable light possible."]}
