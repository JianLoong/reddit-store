I know some people find it very sweet and endearing when close freind\u2019s or family get engaged at their wedding and that\u2019s what I was told by many people at the time. I don\u2019t feel that way however and thought it was very rude to announce something like that at a wedding and take the attention away from the couple. My husband disagrees and says that it was okay because he gave them permission but had somehow never thought to tell me even though it was my wedding too???? His excuse was that I might have told the fianc\u00e9 which I wouldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t even know her well. What made me even more furious was that I felt they were taking advantage of our wedding, the decor, venue, props, photographer etc. which we had put out hard earned money into and worked hours overtime for. People were obviously very excited for them and were swooning over them the whole night and I felt that they were intentionally showing off which just pissed me off even more. I am not mad at my husband anymore, since it was almost a year ago but I guess I still have not forgiven the couple.\n\nI was also friendly with Luke before also we weren\u2019t as close and to me he was always my \u201chusbands friend\u201d and not \u201cmy friend\u201d. Since that whole situation at my wedding I have not talked to him except to explain how I felt about him proposing at my wedding but my husband still contacts and meets Luke often. Luke and his fianc\u00e9 announced that they were getting married mid next year and invited my husband and I. I really don\u2019t want to go and don\u2019t feel comfortable going but said that my husband could go if he wants to. Their wedding is also kind of far from us so we would have to drive quite a bit and book a hotel for the day before and after. I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth it to spend my time and money for that but my husband can if he wants. \n\nMy husband said that I was being petty and self centred I have to go because because my husband is the best man and would look odd without a date and. He also said that I should just support the couple on their big day even if I don\u2019t like them it would le be rude because they came to our wedding. I just told him that was funny considering how they \u201csupported\u201d us on our big day. If i\u2019m being honest I don\u2019t care about being rude to the couple I just don\u2019t want my husband to think I\u2019m intentionally trying to be rude I just don\u2019t want to go because I don\u2019t feel comfortable going to the wedding of people I don\u2019t like.\n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t go?\n\nedit1: yes Luke had my husbands permission but he asked my husband not to tell me for the reason that i might let it slip to the fianc\u00e9. I wouldn\u2019t tell her at all because I have no contact with her no phone number socials etc. I think that he didn\u2019t want to tell be because he knew I wouldn\u2019t not like it.\n\n\nedit2: no they never apologised they were kind of just like \u201cyour hubby said yes so it\u2019s fine, you never had a say it\u2019s not your decision to make bc im your husbands best friend not yours so it\u2019s his decision etc.\u201d\n\nedit3: for the people asking what they did at the wedding they just hogged a few tables with a bunch of close friends (who are also a few of out close freinds) and did their own thing I guess and from what i heard when I went over it was all about their engagement. they also hogged the photographer for a bit.\n\n", "created_utc": 1702985022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lzng7/wibta_if_i_dont_go_to_my_husbands_best_friends/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
