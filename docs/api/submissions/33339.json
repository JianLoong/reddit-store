I know some people find it very sweet and endearing when close freind\u2019s or family get engaged at their wedding and that\u2019s what I was told by many people at the time. I don\u2019t feel that way however and thought it was very rude to announce something like that at a wedding and take the attention away from the couple. My husband disagrees and says that it was okay because he gave them permission but had somehow never thought to tell me even though it was my wedding too???? His excuse was that I might have told the fianc\u00e9 which I wouldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t even know her well. What made me even more furious was that I felt they were taking advantage of our wedding, the decor, venue, props, photographer etc. which we had put out hard earned money into and worked hours overtime for. People were obviously very excited for them and were swooning over them the whole night and I felt that they were intentionally showing off which just pissed me off even more. I am not mad at my husband anymore, since it was almost a year ago but I guess I still have not forgiven the couple.\n\nI was also friendly with Luke before also we weren\u2019t as close and to me he was always my \u201chusbands friend\u201d and not \u201cmy friend\u201d. Since that whole situation at my wedding I have not talked to him except to explain how I felt about him proposing at my wedding but my husband still contacts and meets Luke often. Luke and his fianc\u00e9 announced that they were getting married mid next year and invited my husband and I. I really don\u2019t want to go and don\u2019t feel comfortable going but said that my husband could go if he wants to. Their wedding is also kind of far from us so we would have to drive quite a bit and book a hotel for the day before and after. I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth it to spend my time and money for that but my husband can if he wants. \n\nMy husband said that I was being petty and self centred I have to go because because my husband is the best man and would look odd without a date and. He also said that I should just support the couple on their big day even if I don\u2019t like them it would le be rude because they came to our wedding. I just told him that was funny considering how they \u201csupported\u201d us on our big day. If i\u2019m being honest I don\u2019t care about being rude to the couple I just don\u2019t want my husband to think I\u2019m intentionally trying to be rude I just don\u2019t want to go because I don\u2019t feel comfortable going to the wedding of people I don\u2019t like.\n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t go?\n\nedit1: yes Luke had my husbands permission but he asked my husband not to tell me for the reason that i might let it slip to the fianc\u00e9.

But this is how you support someone you love. You and your husband and his friend are very young. As time passes his relationship with his friend may become less important, and his relationship with you should only grow more important and stronger. You don\u2019t have to be friends with the best friend or his fiance. But if you love your husband and value your marriage, my advice is to go to the wedding as his date and be there for him. \n\nAlso\u2026if you don\u2019t go people may wonder why and you may think that this will be an effective way to punish the friend and his bride. But this is going to be their wedding where everyone in attendance is their friends and family and those people are going to support them and their opinion is not going to be that you are the wronged party, if they think about you at all they will think you are being petty. I really do think the best way to handle the situation is to go to the wedding, look fantastic, be polite, and in general give the impression that you are the bigger person. Sometimes I think it can be quite satisfying to give the impression of being the bigger person even if inside your own mind you are still quite mad at someone.", "One of the biggest red flags here is that hubby agreed to keep a secret from you - and not a little harmless secret like what someone is getting for Christmas, but a major element of your own wedding.

Also time for a very serious discussion with you husband about secret keeping in the marriage and betrayal of your trust. \n\nI am also of the opinion that there isn\u2019t a finite amount of attention available. Luke did not steal anything from you. This issue of attention is in your head - people celebrated you AND they celebrated Luke.

Also Luke\u2019s bride had nothing to do with this, so it might be helpful to think of attending as an act of empathy for her, so she doesn\u2019t have to get married while the groom\u2019s best man sulks because his wife is mad at him and hates the groom.

That\u2019s not getting permission, that\u2019s hiding it from her intentionally.", "It is lunacy to me that you're comparing greenlighting a proposal comparable to disagreeing on centerpieces. Proposals/pregnancy announcements are one of the most widely known huge deals when it comes to wedding planning.", "Happy cake day! Now you\u2019ve got a second \ud83d\ude0c", "Happy Cake Day! \ud83c\udf82 and a happy holidays!", "Bahahaha evil genius here", "The fact that your fiance / husband didn't tell you is a bad start to the marriage. Aren't you meant to honour each other above all others.", "That's also bad. But still I think your husband is even worse then Luke for that. He is the one that is supposed to aleays have your back and he should know you enough to know you can keep a secret. He could have even ask you \"what would you do if somone proposed on yout wedding\" in casual conversation. Then he would know you wouldn't like IT and he then could refuse Luke without spillinh the secret to you. Really Luke did bad but your husband totally fucked up.", "You seem to be looking for a reason to let your husband off the hook. It is totally on him. His friend is a socially inept moron.This is on the men. You and the new fiance are blameless. Your husband is the big problem. He said yes and ignored your feelings before and after.", "But your husband allowed it. He also disrespected you by not asking if it was okay with you. They both hid it from you because they probably knew you'd say no, and not because you'd tell the fiancee. I mean, how hard is it to say \"don't tell fiancee, the one you don't ever contact\"? You can dislike Luke and not want to go to his wedding but you have a husband problem, not a Luke problem.", "Your husband agreed to honor Luke's request so he prioritized Luke over you. You came in second. You continue to come in second. No apology. Your husband only wants you at the wedding because he will be embarrassed if you don't go. He doesn't care if you are uncomfortable. He just doesn't want people to know you are angry about your own wedding being hijacked. His attitude is that your feelings are irrelevant. \n\nIs that how you want to live your life? I suggest, since you are already married, that you get couples counseling. If your husband refuses then don't go to the wedding. Do get yourself counseling so that you can learn how to bring things like this up to discuss them with your husband. Even if your husband goes for counseling it doesn't mean you need to attend the wedding.\n\nI'd tell him something like, \"The proposal at our wedding, without asking me ahead of time, showed me that I come second to your friend. I was disappointed in you and your lack of respect for me. I am still disappointed. I've tried to put it behind me but it is still there festering. None of you have apologized. You've decided that my feelings are irrelevant to you and your decisions. I cannot go and support their wedding. Just the idea of their wedding reminds me of how they took over our wedding and reminds me that my wedding day sucked due to all three of you. I won't go to their wedding. I am still seriously disappointed in you.\"", "You know what makes me 100% believe that? The fact that you didn\u2019t get mad or offended that I asked - which tells me you\u2019re secure and confident and I appreciate that so much. \n\nI think just don\u2019t go and see what comes of it. Lots of people are gonna tell you to be petty but the best thing is to let the trash take itself out, you\u2019re too mature for that bullshit imo.", "Husband could\u2019ve stood by her with the half a$$ apology. He didn\u2019t. He just told her to get over it. Neither of the men care that OP is upset. The clear message is for her to get over it.", "Admitting to yourself that the person you\u2019ve chosen to share your life with is a jerk face can be really hard.  Honestly what she did can be healthy, doing her best to put something behind her so she doesn\u2019t poison her life.  Also the past can\u2019t be changed.  She\u2019s doing just right, refusing to hangout with a couple numpties, I\u2019ll wager everyone will talk shit about her though.  What a mess, hopefully she books a luxurious spa day for herself.  NTA", "The husband did not have to agree to ANY part of this.  Hubby owes his wife the respect to give her a choice.  His reason is junk.  There's no evidence to support the fact that OP would run and tell the bride-to-be.  They don't talk, and OP as a bride has more than enough sense and recent experience to understand that you don't blow the surprise.  The husband pulled a fast one on her.  He knew OP would veto the suggestion.  It was HIS idea to keep it to himself in order to do this for his buddy.", "Hold a grudge at best friend for asking but not at husband for actually saying yes? \n\nThat's messed up logic", "My best friend straight up asked me to propose to my girlfriend at his wedding. Friendship dynamics and wedding expectations are all over the place. (Especially in OP's marriage, sounds like!)", "There's nothing wrong with asking, but he shouldn't have gone through with it without asking the both of them and the husband shouldn't have signed off on it on his own either.", "Irrelevant once hubby said yes. Not everyone has the best common sense to now what you think is right and wrong.", "Absolutely. I'm not defending your husband at all. But you claim you've forgiven him for that.\n\nMaybe asking whether you'd be an asshole or not is the wrong question. Your husband was unquestionably an asshole for what he did and you have every right to be angry about it. The question now is whether punishing him in this way is going to lead to a better outcome for you than attending the wedding despite still being angry. To me, assuming you want to stay married to this man, you're better off supporting him by attending. All this tit-for-tat, you did this so now I have the right to do this other thing in return stuff is a recipe for divorce.", "Yes, if you end up not liking someone for something someone did to you, thats a grudge. If you dont agree, take it up with Miriam Webster.", "Exactly this. The correct response to \u201ccan I do this thing at your wedding but please don\u2019t tell your fianc\u00e9e I\u2019m going to do it\u201d is \u201cOP and I are partners. I can\u2019t make a decision about our wedding without running it by her first.\u201d\n\nOP, your husband isn\u2019t treating you like you\u2019re his partner in this, and that\u2019s what I find most concerning.", "haha thanks i don\u2019t think that i will go but we\u2019ll see", "Yeah, agreed, he\u2019s a bag of dicks and should be called out as such.", "I disagree - because now this will start a separate argument with her husband over not going to the wedding. Reddit saying she\u2019s not the AH does not mean the husband wont be pissed she\u2019s not going. \n\nSo now all she\u2019s done is prolong this fight into a whole other issue because she misplaced her anger about the engagement.", "That's honeymoon-period \"logic.\" You see your person with rose-colored glasses, and you miss the red flags.", "In this case, there IS something wrong with asking. There are two HUGE unwritten rules for ALL weddings:\n1. Do not wear white to someone else\u2019s wedding \n2. Do NOT hijack someone else\u2019s wedding for your own shit (engagement, pregnancy announcement etc).\n\nTo even ask makes the friend an AH. To agree makes the husband an AH.", "It's common courtesy to pop the question on your own time and not someone else's. Why are basic manners elusive these days?", "She shouldn't have to force herself to go when it's making her uncomfortable for the husband who started this in the first place.  He's a big boy and can go by himself.\n\nEdited to respond.  He's done nothing to take accountability. She can't save the marriage by herself.  If she goes to please him, she's just continuing a pattern where he walks all over her.  Moreover, the friend committed his own offense to her when he asked her husband not to tell her and made no apology either.", "You know what I can\u2019t stop thinking about this, so I\u2019ll add one more thing. Next time he gets upset that you\u2019re not going, maybe you can use this script or something like it??\u2014 \n\n\u201cHubby what are you upset or worried about happening? The worst thing that could happen is just that people notice I\u2019m not there and make small talk about it wondering why - and really that\u2019s only a problem in that it takes away attention from the couple. But me protecting my peace and therefore excusing myself from their wedding and that unfortunately leading to chatter isn\u2019t the same as them inserting themself - with your blessing mind you- into our wedding and purposely yearning for that chatter. And at the very least if you can\u2019t see that those things are different you can admit that I\u2019m doing no worse to them than they did to me. At this point I\u2019m just concerned you seem to care more about your friend\u2019s feelings than mine, as that much is very clear.\u201d", "I don\u2019t think you had any intention of going but wanted to be validated by this sub, so I guess have fun listening to him bring this up in every fight.", "I agree with you, but the fact that they're unwritten rules means not everyone is aware of them and different people can have different opinions on whether they're good rules or not. As the OP said in her post, some people think it's cool to share a life event with a close friend like that. OP might have thought it was cute as well, honestly, if she liked the best man and his girlfriend more.", "They\u2019ve been best friends since they were 6 years old. I get that. Some people sincerely enjoy their loved ones proposing at their wedding at the after party.\n\nThe problem is the husband doesn\u2019t respect or give a shit about OP when she might disagree. EVEN ON THEIR WEDDING DAY.\n\nAnd the best friend clearly doesn\u2019t respect or give a shit about OP either. \n\nAsking your best friend since you were 6 is forgivable, that\u2019s a person that should know the person getting married well enough. \n\nBut that generally will hinge on giving any fuck at all about the person your best friend is marrying and knowing them well enough that they *might* be happy and completely fine with it, otherwise don\u2019t even ask the best friend.\n\nSolid guess that OP is like a random small aspect of her husbands life to the best friend. Like a pet or a hobby they do occasionally but they\u2019ve never really talked about.", "What does \"uncomfortable\" mean in this case? That's such a meaningless word. She doesn't want to go because she's still pissed off and wants to punish her husband and the couple. Which is understandable! But that doesn't mean that it's the best decision to make. \n\nSure, he's an adult man who is physically capable of going by himself, but this isn't a trip to the grocery store. It's an important life event for him. His best friend is getting married and he's the best man. Whether you think he deserves to be punished in this way or not, it's not going to make her marriage better to do it.", "I think Reddit sometimes forgets that there are infinite variables and complex dynamics in any situation. My best friend and his fiancee asked me to propose to my GF at their wedding. They were disappointed when I didn't. Maybe OP's husband and his friend had that kind of relationship. (Obviously, OP didn't share the feeling.)", "maybe reload it"]}
