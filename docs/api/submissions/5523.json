My family (31M, 31F, 7F, 3F) is ready to move further north and out of the state to get out of the same old routine and exponentially growing suburban area that we\u2019re in now, to go out to the country with acreage and less noise, more outdoor activity in a cooler environment.\nWe live 5 minutes from my dad whom we haven\u2019t seen in 6 months. I try to make plans and he\u2019s busy, doesn\u2019t make an effort to see his grandchildren, before the last visit, it was months. We didn\u2019t see him for almost a year once. After my youngest daughter was born, he didn\u2019t come see her until she was 4 months old. He\u2019s not a loner, goes out and does stuff and has his new wife\u2019s family over all the time (not my stepmom, they got married a few years after I did, my mom and him divorced when I was 7, he took custody of my brother and I, I\u2019m still close with my mom)\nI\u2019m thinking about just leaving and not telling him about it. The last test to see if he cares or not. The whole thing really bothers my wife.\n\n*EDIT* more info:\nI spent 2 years in Italy while enlisted in the military, during that time (I was still single with no family) he and my long-term stepmom (I was 7 years old when they were married, 20 in Italy, so 13 years as a parent figure) got a divorce without telling me. Also they tossed most of my shit, my long distance girlfriend (now wife, lived in the same city as my dad) had to go over and salvage what she could that I still had left there when they emptied the house that I lived in from 2003 - 2011. \nI\u2019ve tried sitting down with him and talking on the phone and texting him about the status of our relationship, he just blows it off as \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong, we\u2019re completely fine! Love ya!\u201d\nWhich is more frustrating than anything. \nI will likely end up taking him next week, not 100% committed yet, and it will probably end up with me being angry and upset or maybe he\u2019ll underreact and treat it like no big deal. Which would also be upsetting. I haven\u2019t fully decided yet\nThank you all for your differing opinions and viewpoints. I really appreciate it all. I\u2019m ok with being the asshole if that\u2019s what it comes down to, or being the bigger person maybe. Idk but I\u2019ll talk with my wife about it, she usually helps me with difficult decisions like this when I can\u2019t decide.

Didn\u2019t tell my father that I moved across the country. \n\nSome weeks after my move, he called me and told me he will be near me in a few months and that he could visit for an hour. (He only visited me when his new wife had business in my city once a year)\n\nAnd my answer was: \u201eWell, I haven\u2019t been to CITY for a few months now. Have a good time there!\u201c \n\nSo worth it. \n\nHe tried to throw a fit but I stopped him with a \u201eHuh? I thought you knew? After all, you talk to my sister all the time?

Nothing can justify that. \n\nBut also acting the same way your father do is not right. You can inform him either by text or call it is your choice but not telling him just out of spite doesn't sit well with me. You totally have right to be mad with your father because he isn't putting any efforts from his side.\n\nIt is your call honestly. Whatever you choose shouldn't make you regret.", "I went through a similar experience with my dad growing up. He didn\u2019t have any custody, he was a weekend dad who saw me on his time. He would consistently blow off our plans, and go months without checking in on me. As a kid I would be so excited when I did get to see him, just for the sheer novelty that he was my dad. But as a teen/adult, I realized he was barely putting in any effort at all, and I stopped trying all together. I reached out to him on his birthday, Father\u2019s Day, and general holidays, but that was about it.  He died unexpectedly when I was 26, and I never resolved those feelings with him.\n\nWhen I look back with hindsight, as an adult I did not want much from him. I wanted a dad that would call me before a snow storm to make sure that I was all set up, or someone who would call me when they knew I had something important happening to reflect back on how it went. It was all kinda basic dad stuff that I felt he should have instinctively known to do for me; I was always resentful that he didn\u2019t just do it on his own, that I never took the time to sit with him and tell him clearly what I wanted and the things that bothered me. My dad and I never talked about anything important when we saw each other, it was always the same clipped small talk on repeat.\n\nCommunication is key. How important is it to you to have him in your life and your kids lives? How hard do you really try with your dad - on the days where he\u2019s busy, do you just get mad at the fact he\u2019s busy again and drop it, or do you try and make a rain date for another time with him? My advice would be to sit down and talk with him, just you and him; about how his actions have made you feel neglected. Give him the chance to make things better, he might actually try to make more of an effort, or he might not - but you\u2019re already used to the disappointment anyways, so how could it hurt things?\n\nNTA, you do you and what\u2019s best for your family. It does not sound like your dad has done much to deserve to be a part of your life. However, if you do want a relationship with him in the future, keep in mind that relationships are a two way street, and just being direct and clear with him about how his actions have made you feel, may go a long way.", "first NTA,,   \n2nd, if he is a non-aggressive person (physically),,   \nhe don't showup,, but if your partner is worried,, just tell your father", "YTA never do these stupid ass ultimatums or tests.

Let him know now that are planning to move, then tell him that you are disappointed that he never made any effort while you've lived close by and that it saddens you a little to know that he prefers his new family over his grandchildren.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Otherwise you'd be in a different situation.\n\nDon't not tell him to test him, don't tell him because he isn't really part of your lives and doesn't need to know.

Just go and don't feel bad.", "Thank you for that", "I really appreciate this, it sounds a little similar, the big difference is my dad was definitely there as a kid, just emotionally unavailable. Now it\u2019s just excuse after excuse, this new wife he\u2019s been with for years and years now has kept him from seeing his own kids, even my three younger brothers, I still hold a lot of resentment towards him for pushing my only full-blood little brother away. He moved to California a few years ago and my dad never really accepted him for being gay. Wasn\u2019t hateful really, but he let his wife make everything super awkward when his husband was around (his husband is a self absorbed, opinionated, controlling asshole, but that\u2019s another story for later) and it made it really shitty when we would hang out. \nWe used to see them often when my oldest was young, but the. My wife and his got into a big argument because she\u2019s a bit selfish and blamed my wife for something, idk. But he took her side and we haven\u2019t really seen him since, after that very brief period. I\u2019ll try, maybe this could be the one thing that can bring him back. Now that I have kids, I can honestly say I would divorce a wife that I have no kids with to be with my own kids and especially my grandkids. My kids mean more to me than anything and it just frustrates me that he doesn\u2019t feel the same way about any of my brothers and I. \nThank you for your input so much.

As long as he is in this relationship he will continue to prioritize her, as it appears she won\u2019t have it any other way. It\u2019s great that you have a perspective on how toxic his behavior is and can\u2019t imagine doing it yourself, seeing the patterns and breaking the cycle is a battle in itself. I think the question you should be asking yourself here is, do you really want him and his wife (because as of right now, they are a packaged deal) in your life and kids lives? After their treatment of your bio brother and his husband, they don\u2019t sound like a very positive or nurturing influence for your kids to be around.\n\nI do still think that talking with him about the past, and what you wish the future to look like, may help the situation more than hinder it. But there are also some fundamental issues at play here. If there\u2019s no willingness to change the way things are; at the end of the day you have done what you can do. \n\nBest of luck to you and your family. Even if your dad continues to be an absent part of your life, you can always build new connections, and found family can be just as crucial and meaningful as bio family.", "Considering both your answer and your edit, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole no matter what you decide. It sounds like your dad has never really been emotionally present. His shortcoming isn\u2019t a slight against you or your family. Only you can decide if his involvement in your life and your family\u2019s life is worth the effort you have to expend to facilitate it and the hurt of knowing that if you don\u2019t expend the effort, he won\u2019t. \n\nMy advice is that you\u2019re excited to move and start a new chapter, which is terrific. Don\u2019t darken that excitement by turning it into a test you already know he can\u2019t pass. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure you already know this, but his current wife is most likely doing all the coordination and labor for him to spend time with her family. He probably just shows up, putting no more actual effort into seeing them than he does for seeing you. NTA. Best of luck with the move, I hope it\u2019s a great new experience for your family.", "It's hard to struggle with. We want our parents to realize what we need and provide it. It's a natural want, and all these warm and fuzzy stories make it feel like everyone has something we don't.\n\nI finally started to take a deep dive to look into it once I started seeing it affect people that had nothing to do with what may be among the core causes for how I feel.\n\nYour experience is yours, but I wanted to share my ongoing experience because something about your post rang very true for things I'm working on.", "This is one of those situations where the father can pull out any number of excuses if OP asks them directly on why they have missing.", "Really appreciate this comment, it\u2019s more to think about, I feel bad for my two youngest brothers as well because he\u2019s just repeating the cycle with them, he made no plans to see us for Christmas, but his wife\u2019s entire family will be there today and tomorrow, just like every year.  At this point I don\u2019t even know if I want an invite, guess I\u2019m just hurt we didn\u2019t get one.", "Thank you very much", "Your story definitely hit a chord with me, more so on the absenteeism, just translated to his lack of emotional support for all of us. You had it worse for sure, but your views on how you wish you could go back and try harder range pretty loud for me too."]}
