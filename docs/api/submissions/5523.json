It\u2019s disappointing to say in the least that your father hasn\u2019t made much of an effort to spend any time with his grandchildren.\n\nPerhaps it is a good idea if you tell him that you are moving far away because it might make him realise that he hasn\u2019t been involved with his grandchildren much and he might change for the better but if he doesn\u2019t respond how you hope at least then you will know whether it\u2019s worth having any sort of relationship with him. Most importantly, it will ensure that he doesn\u2019t have any excuses to justify why he can\u2019t spend time with his grandchildren.\n\nIn any case, I wish you and your family all the best.", "NTA You have to live where is best for you and your family. But take the high ground here and tell him you're moving.

Didn\u2019t tell my father that I moved across the country. \n\nSome weeks after my move, he called me and told me he will be near me in a few months and that he could visit for an hour. (He only visited me when his new wife had business in my city once a year)\n\nAnd my answer was: \u201eWell, I haven\u2019t been to CITY for a few months now. Have a good time there!\u201c \n\nSo worth it. \n\nHe tried to throw a fit but I stopped him with a \u201eHuh? I thought you knew? After all, you talk to my sister all the time?

Nothing can justify that. \n\nBut also acting the same way your father do is not right. You can inform him either by text or call it is your choice but not telling him just out of spite doesn't sit well with me. You totally have right to be mad with your father because he isn't putting any efforts from his side.\n\nIt is your call honestly. Whatever you choose shouldn't make you regret.", "I went through a similar experience with my dad growing up. He didn\u2019t have any custody, he was a weekend dad who saw me on his time. He would consistently blow off our plans, and go months without checking in on me. As a kid I would be so excited when I did get to see him, just for the sheer novelty that he was my dad. But as a teen/adult, I realized he was barely putting in any effort at all, and I stopped trying all together. I reached out to him on his birthday, Father\u2019s Day, and general holidays, but that was about it.  He died unexpectedly when I was 26, and I never resolved those feelings with him.\n\nWhen I look back with hindsight, as an adult I did not want much from him. I wanted a dad that would call me before a snow storm to make sure that I was all set up, or someone who would call me when they knew I had something important happening to reflect back on how it went. It was all kinda basic dad stuff that I felt he should have instinctively known to do for me; I was always resentful that he didn\u2019t just do it on his own, that I never took the time to sit with him and tell him clearly what I wanted and the things that bothered me. My dad and I never talked about anything important when we saw each other, it was always the same clipped small talk on repeat.\n\nCommunication is key. How important is it to you to have him in your life and your kids lives? How hard do you really try with your dad - on the days where he\u2019s busy, do you just get mad at the fact he\u2019s busy again and drop it, or do you try and make a rain date for another time with him? My advice would be to sit down and talk with him, just you and him; about how his actions have made you feel neglected. Give him the chance to make things better, he might actually try to make more of an effort, or he might not - but you\u2019re already used to the disappointment anyways, so how could it hurt things?\n\nNTA, you do you and what\u2019s best for your family. It does not sound like your dad has done much to deserve to be a part of your life. However, if you do want a relationship with him in the future, keep in mind that relationships are a two way street, and just being direct and clear with him about how his actions have made you feel, may go a long way.", "first NTA,,   \n2nd, if he is a non-aggressive person (physically),,   \nhe don't showup,, but if your partner is worried,, just tell your father", "YTA never do these stupid ass ultimatums or tests. Either be an adult and talk to him about it or just go full on NC with the expressed desire to not talk to or see him again.", "**YTA**\n\n>The last test to see if he cares or not.\n\nYour plan is a passive-aggressive test and you are going to be disappointed when he fails your *test* and it's not going to make you feel any better about cutting him out of your life.    Let him know now that are planning to move, then tell him that you are disappointed that he never made any effort while you've lived close by and that it saddens you a little to know that he prefers his new family over his grandchildren.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
