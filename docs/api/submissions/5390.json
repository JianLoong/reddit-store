{"id": 5390, "submission_id": "zsosyt", "title": "UPDATE--AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to go to a sports game?", "selftext": "I showed my boyfriend [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm95ym/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_go_to_a/) thread, and to my surprise, he actually strongly did not believe I was TA or being manipulative, but he also didn't think he was TA either--which he's not. As someone who has actually been in the relationship for the last 5 years, he knows me pretty well and he knew I'd be upset, but he also knew it was a conversation to be had in person.\n\nThe next day he left work early and came to town to surprise me and also make sure I was alright. We had dinner, watched a movie, and then had a serious conversation about what had happened the day prior. He understood why I reacted the way I did, and he wasn't upset but wanted us to talk about our communication and our individual needs. He compared me to my cat with his abandonment issues (which was cute, I'll admit) and explained that he's sad he can't always physically be there for me when I'm going through a depressive episode, but that he also needs time to himself to enjoy the things he does too, and that it's not a reflection of how much he loves me if he chooses to spend the day somewhere else.\n\nCan we take a second to appreciate how good he is with words? As someone who (clearly) struggles with putting my feelings into words, I feel like being with him is a breath of fresh air. God, I really do love him.\n\nAnyways, I apologized for my reaction, cried for a while in his arms, and told him I loved him.\n\nAs a result of this, and coming to terms with how alone I really feel. I've spoken to my manager and been cleared to call out of work next week until after Christmas and am going home as soon as I can. I realize I'm not in a good headspace and I don't want it to affect my relationship or work performance any more than it already has. If my mental health continues to decline, I'll look into therapy.\n\nAlso, for those wondering, my cat is a rescue and becomes very destructive when left alone for longer periods of time due to stress of abandonment. I'm specialized in rehabilitation for animals from abusive households, so I'm doing my own work with him to get past these abandonment issues and stress responses. But a 4 year old cat who was abused for the first 3 years of his life is bound to have problems that are going to take a lot of time to work through. Not that this information means anything to any of you, but I'm tired of being told I chose my cat over my boyfriend when my cat had nothing to do with it, and my boyfriend was not happy with those accusations either.\n\nFor those who offered genuine advice and guidance, thank you, it means the world.", "created_utc": 1671723189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsosyt/updateaita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_go_to/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Well, all well that ends well I guess. BUT do not wait until your mental health declines. I read your original post and to be honest, I didn't see an AH there, I saw a cry for help. You are already not in a good headspace and while spending time at home will alleviate the symptoms it will not treat the root cause. Be well.", "Glad you both have a healthy relationship. Many well wishes.", "I read the original post and I don't think either of you are TA. I had an ex do something similar to me once, his plans for the day fell through so we made other plans, and were just about to act on said plans, when his previous plans somehow ended up being reinstated, so he chose to ditch me (and his kids) to go golfing. I was pretty choked about that. I also struggle with depression and completely understand needing to have that special someone around when you're feeling particularly low. He wouldn't have missed the game either which really rubs me the wrong way.", "Glad it was resolved well, OP! And that you have each other.\n\nJust gently noting, though, I wouldn't wait for your mental health to decline further to look into therapy. What you described is already a decline. I worked at a psychotherapy clinic for a while, and one of the things we said often and to everyone was that therapy isn't just for when you're in a crisis - it's to prevent you from ever having one.\n\nThat isn't to say you can't pursue it when you're feeling worse, of course, or that it isn't useful at any stage. It's just saying that why reach that point at all? See someone now, especially since it sounds like you have these low points regularly around this time, and reap the benefit of learning coping mechanisms before you actively need them.", "Bro \n\n>. Not that this information means anything to any of you,\n\nI do care. Can you post a few more updates about his r\u00e9habilitation ? :( i hope he gets better :(("]}
