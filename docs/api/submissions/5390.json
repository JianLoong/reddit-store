{"id": 5390, "submission_id": "zsosyt", "title": "UPDATE--AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to go to a sports game?", "selftext": "I showed my boyfriend [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm95ym/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_go_to_a/) thread, and to my surprise, he actually strongly did not believe I was TA or being manipulative, but he also didn't think he was TA either--which he's not. As someone who has actually been in the relationship for the last 5 years, he knows me pretty well and he knew I'd be upset, but he also knew it was a conversation to be had in person.\n\nThe next day he left work early and came to town to surprise me and also make sure I was alright. We had dinner, watched a movie, and then had a serious conversation about what had happened the day prior. He understood why I reacted the way I did, and he wasn't upset but wanted us to talk about our communication and our individual needs. He compared me to my cat with his abandonment issues (which was cute, I'll admit) and explained that he's sad he can't always physically be there for me when I'm going through a depressive episode, but that he also needs time to himself to enjoy the things he does too, and that it's not a reflection of how much he loves me if he chooses to spend the day somewhere else.\n\nCan we take a second to appreciate how good he is with words? As someone who (clearly) struggles with putting my feelings into words, I feel like being with him is a breath of fresh air. God, I really do love him.\n\nAnyways, I apologized for my reaction, cried for a while in his arms, and told him I loved him.\n\nAs a result of this, and coming to terms with how alone I really feel. I've spoken to my manager and been cleared to call out of work next week until after Christmas and am going home as soon as I can. I realize I'm not in a good headspace and I don't want it to affect my relationship or work performance any more than it already has. If my mental health continues to decline, I'll look into therapy.\n\nAlso, for those wondering, my cat is a rescue and becomes very destructive when left alone for longer periods of time due to stress of abandonment. I'm specialized in rehabilitation for animals from abusive households, so I'm doing my own work with him to get past these abandonment issues and stress responses. But a 4 year old cat who was abused for the first 3 years of his life is bound to have problems that are going to take a lot of time to work through. Not that this information means anything to any of you, but I'm tired of being told I chose my cat over my boyfriend when my cat had nothing to do with it, and my boyfriend was not happy with those accusations either.\n\nFor those who offered genuine advice and guidance, thank you, it means the world.", "created_utc": 1671723189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsosyt/updateaita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_go_to/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Well, all well that ends well I guess. BUT do not wait until your mental health declines. I read your original post and to be honest, I didn't see an AH there, I saw a cry for help. You are already not in a good headspace and while spending time at home will alleviate the symptoms it will not treat the root cause. Be well.", "Glad you both have a healthy relationship. Many well wishes.", "I read the original post and I don't think either of you are TA. I had an ex do something similar to me once, his plans for the day fell through so we made other plans, and were just about to act on said plans, when his previous plans somehow ended up being reinstated, so he chose to ditch me (and his kids) to go golfing. I was pretty choked about that. I also struggle with depression and completely understand needing to have that special someone around when you're feeling particularly low. He wouldn't have missed the game either which really rubs me the wrong way.", "Glad it was resolved well, OP! And that you have each other.\n\nJust gently noting, though, I wouldn't wait for your mental health to decline further to look into therapy. What you described is already a decline. I worked at a psychotherapy clinic for a while, and one of the things we said often and to everyone was that therapy isn't just for when you're in a crisis - it's to prevent you from ever having one.\n\nThat isn't to say you can't pursue it when you're feeling worse, of course, or that it isn't useful at any stage. It's just saying that why reach that point at all? See someone now, especially since it sounds like you have these low points regularly around this time, and reap the benefit of learning coping mechanisms before you actively need them.", "Bro \n\n>. Not that this information means anything to any of you,\n\nI do care. Can you post a few more updates about his r\u00e9habilitation ? :( i hope he gets better :((", "If you're a full-time student, your college/university may have a mental health center, including free therapy. I saw a free therapist at my college weekly for my entire sophomore year, and it was a lifesaver.", "Honestly people were kind of brutal on the last post, it seemed like an overreaction. It sounds like there is a lot of love between you guys!!", " INFO: Why are you waiting until your mental health gets worse to get help? \n\nYou are not at fault for having a mental illness. Depression is a mental illness. \n\nAs someone who also struggles with one and who waited until they had a breakdown and ended up attempting hurting themselves at 2 AM 10 years ago. \n\nI am begging you to seek help now. Going home is a temporary fix. You\u2019ll feel great, come back refreshed, and then it\u2019ll happen again. Only this time, it\u2019ll be worse. \n\nYou deserve so much more, you deserve care and love and support. Your partner also deserves a partner who is taking their mental health seriously and exploring all available avenues and not *waiting until you have a major breakdown* in order for you to seek the help you know you need. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard I know. You are a wonderful person, and your partner is too. If you can\u2019t get therapy for yourself then get it for him. \n\nOP, before my breakdown, I would go home, feel amazing, come back, and repeat the cycle. All the time going \u201cI\u2019m not fine but I\u2019m not horrible!\u201d Until I was. \n\nOne of my relationships with a fantastic person ended because that. They told me \u201cI can\u2019t keep watching you refuse to help yourself, I can\u2019t force you to get the extra help you need. I need to put myself first here, I love you but I can\u2019t support you when you insist on continuously throwing yourself into the deep end, begin drowning, and then claim hanging on to the edge is good enough\u201d \n\nThey are still a wonderful person and I am now with an equally fantastic partner that I\u2019m able to support too. \n\nYou are a good person Op. But you keep clinging to the edge of the pool and convinced yourself that so long as you\u2019re not in the middle, your not drowning.", "Just know that his mental health matters too and I hope it\u2019s not always going to be about you and your mental health.", "I read the original post and didn't think you were the asshole. You just have some things you need to work through and I think people were very quick to jump on you. Glad you're getting things sorted.", "I am gad you have had a happy outcome. I would have voted if I'd seen your first post a NAH, simply because you got upset, but I don't think you were manipulative. My impression was that you were trying to sort out your feelings and gain perspective. Your conflict seemed an ordinary sort of thing between two people working out their relationship and I'm happy for you both that you had the ability and desire to do so. Have a happy Christmas!", "I thought the same thing its better to go to therapy now to get coping mechanisms etc before it gets to a point that will be too hard to handle"]}
