Ryan\u2019s other siblings clearly do like me, it\u2019s just Jack. He\u2019s recently married (December 2022) and has a wife that I rarely see either.\n\nOn Friday Ryan\u2019s family had a gathering, they hadn\u2019t seen everyone together for a while.\n\nWe were all sitting on the floor on a sheet eating dinner (in my culture it\u2019s normal, arab-pakistani Muslims who are not traditional, but we are from the UK), and Jack was sitting near me next to his wife.\n\nKeep in mind that Jack has very curly hair up to his upper shoulders. It was in front of his face and I saw a strand of it on the floor so I very politely asked if he should tie it back to prevent it getting into the food.\n\nI don\u2019t know why this got to him, but he didn\u2019t even LOOK at my direction and he said \u201cno\u201d. So I VERY politely said I saw a strand on the floor and I don\u2019t think anyone wants to be getting hair in their teeth. It\u2019s pretty gross. Again, he simply said \u201cno\u201d without looking at me and Ryan told me to be quiet. \n\nAfter that Jack whispered something to his wife and they sneakily left earlier than they were supposed to?? \n\nI would appreciate some insight.

Seems like there\u2019s other reasons to why he doesn\u2019t seem to like you, are you always this pushy?", "YTA.  \n\nYou clearly don\u2019t like this person, and I think it\u2019s obvious that your feelings about him being \u201cawkward, extremely scrawny\u201d and \u201cscary\u201d colored your interaction here.\n\nDid you ask everyone with long hair to tie it back?", "YTA - this was someones home, not a restaurant. Unless everyone else\u2019s hair was tied back and the people with short hair were wearing hairnets, there was no reason to target him.", "YTA. You don't like him and are looking for things to criticize about him. How does one \" sneakily leave early \"? Did they leave without saying goodbye? Did they tell you how long they were staying when they arrived? Or did you just make up another instance where you could insult them?", "YTA - I think Jack\u2019s demeanor and his dislike for you makes you extra sensitive towards him. Leave him and his wife alone. Be polite and move away. You could have very well moved your plate or avoided the food you were concerned about. Let his incident go and leave him alone.", "Yta. If he was the one preparing the food it would be different, but he was literally just sitting there eating his plate. If your plate was close enough to him for his hair to get on your plate then maybe you shouldn't be basically sitting in his lap for meals. \n\nAlso yta for how you described him, the heck does being scrawny and quiet have to do with anything??", "Was Jack the only one with untied long hair? Do you always ask long haired people to tie their hair before eating together? If the answer to either is \"no\", YTA. If it is \"yes\" to both, you might still be a bit of an AH. Or, at least you have some problems (germ phobia or the like) that should be just that: your own. It would be understandable that you'd ask people to tie their hair every time, but still not a very nice thing to do. \nHair falls from everyone's head, even short haired people. The short hair is just less often noticed. If you saw a hair of someone you like on the floor, would you have been equally compelled to ask them to tie their hair? Or was it perhaps just because Jack creeps you out?", "YTA, based on this post I have no doubt that Jack doesn\u2019t like you and more than likely he\u2019s justified", "INFO: Were there communal dishes on the sheet? Did other people have long hair not tied back?", "He probably doesn't like you, because you're an asshole lmao. YTA", ">extremely scrawny\n\nYTA. This detail is so completely unnecessary that you clearly just hate him for no reason. He scares you because he's scrawny? You keep saying you always have felt he dislikes you but haven't provided one single example of him being rude to you or anything. You've just described your own petty, childish dislike for him (for being too small?), maybe he senses what a bad person you are and is rightly standoffish to you.", "YTA You don\u2019t get to tell people how to wear their hair. It\u2019s not a normal precaution to tie your hair while eating. Question: Is this something you often ask people you eat with or did you single him out? Was he the only one not wearing his hair tied back? I\u2019m sorry but if this is how you normally act among friends and family, I understand why he doesn\u2019t like you.", "Info...did everyone have to wear a hairnet...\n\nYTA here, weird thing to say. I see a glimpse of why he might not like you", "I think its the other way around. I think YOU don't like him, he senses that and that's why he is with you how he is. But you're so self-centered that you turned this around, about him not liking you.", "weird dynamics. \n\nNAH.... i wouldnt ask someone to tie up thier hair. Many women eat with thier hair down, it would be super wierd/controling to ask them to tie up thier hair. If jack doesnt mind hair in his own food, then let him eat in peace.", "YTA.", "Yta for critiquing your guest while at the dinner table.
