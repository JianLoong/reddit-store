Which means ... because I don't know how common a prix fixe menu is  ... that you get a predetermined meal for a fixed price. For example, cheese plate, rack of lamb, choice of veg and dessert for, IDK, $100 per person. People go with prix fixe choices because they're often cheaper than ordering everything a la carte.  If this is the case, you should NOT ask the restaurant to switch out the cheese plate for something else. If you don't like what's offered on the prix fixe, shell out the extra $$$ to order everything a la carte.

If there\u2019s a strict \u201cno changes policy\u201d the restaurant can tell you in that call and you can proceed with the previous plan for her to attempt to try the cheeses.

This must happen all the time. Many people have problems with cheese in general. I don't know about your gf. How much she really cares about it.", "Yeah you'd be the AH. Just very simply and plainly, no matter what context: she said no, don't do it. So don't so it. You're coddling your own girlfriend, she's not a 2 year old with lack of discernment, she's a fully capable adult that's open to try things and doesn't need your protection from.. /checks notes/.. cheese.", "YTA. **Listen to your girlfriend.**", "If you are planning on ordering hte coursed meal, I believe this will be difficult for them to  modify.\n\nDon't do this.", "Gentle YTA. You asked and she answered. Its a no so please listen to her. No need to start an unnecessary fight. Shit you can eat the cheese if she doesnt want it. Its all good", "Yes. Good intentions don't absolve you of negative impact.\n\nIf you do something your girlfriend has clearly asked you not to do, the message you are sending is that even when she states her preferences you will disregard it and do what you want to anyway.

YTA", "YWBTA she said no so stop. Simple.", "She can just tell them when you arrive that she doesn't want it. They might bring her something else, they might not. But she won't go hungry.\n\nI too, do not eat cheese like that. My husband and I went to a two Michelin star restaurant in Paris last year, and had the most amazing experience.  I let them know I did not wish to have the cheese. They still brought me a plate, just didn't put anything on it. When the waiter came back, he took my empty plate and joked \"oh look,  you did such a great job cleaning your plate!!\" It made my night! He confided is us that his wife skips out on the cheese as well. \n\nAnd honestly,  other than Daniel in NYC, I've never been to a Michelin star restaurant that would not alter a meal, tasting menu or not. When you are spending a thousand dollars or more for two meals, you're allowed to ask!", "YTA of you go explicitly against what your girlfriend asked. You asked to be nice, she said no.

Your reasoning doesn't matter because she's asked you not to contact them and you're \"considering doing it anyway.\" YWBTA\n\nShe doesn't want to bother them more than she wants different cheese. Accept her personal choice even if you would have chosen something different for your own person.", "I LOVE cheese and am a hard no on Blue Cheese. Listen to her. She sounds willing to try it. I\u2019d be disappointed if my partner ordered something else when I asked him not too", "so she doesn't want to annoy the restaurant staff, and you think the proper solution is to annoy the restaurant staff?", "If you've eaten a lot of cheese, you know plenty of cheese isn't pungent. If she doesn't normally like cheese, chances are she hasn't tried anywhere near all of them. You've doubled down on telling me what you think she thinks as an excuse to ignore what she actually said. No means no. Convincing yourself it means yes when you want it to is an AH move.", "Sometimes, it's 'no substitutions', but if you're at a 2 star place, I guarantee you that at several hundred dollars per person, they will almost certainly accommodate any dietary restrictions (gluten free, lactose intolerant, no pork, etc) and, mostly, are willing to work around strong personal preferences as long as they aren't excessive. \n\nOP is not wrong and wouldn't be an AH for asking the restaurant if they could switch. It would be him going against the GF's explicit wishes that would do it.", ">This. The menu is carefully curated in many michelin star restaurants like a work of art or a performance.\n\nThis very much depends on the restaurant. My favourite Michelin-starred restaurant, that I take time to go to if I'm ever nearby, serves locally-sourced ingredients with a constantly changing menu and a fairly relaxed presentation.\n\nBut even the more \"curated\" restaurants will surely have something pre-made in the kitchen, an amuse bouche or a little tartlette maybe, that could be switched in for someone who doesn't like cheese at little-to-no effort.\n\nIf I was the OP I wouldn't override his gf's wishes, but I might ask for a compromise: let me enquire if they offer such a thing.", "It's part of a trip we're going on, it's the nicest restaurant in Geneva, there are many other courses and when booking it I thought she wouldn't mind if we asked to swap out the cheese plate. In fact, I started the conversation saying \"I'm sure we can swap out the cheese plate\" and she said she didn't want to do that.", "Whether they can accommodate a change, or not, is not pertinent to the OP's question. His GF already told him to \\*not\\* ask for a substitution, if he asks now he WBTA because he would be ignoring her stated preference.", "> completely, totally and entirely negates\n\nAll three!\n\nAlmost any fine dining restaurant will swap out a whole course. It\u2019s easy for them, much easier than making a small change.", "It depends what the OP means by \"set menu\". If it's a multi-course tasting menu, it's probably not cheaper than ordering a starter, main and dessert from the a la carte menu.", "No, being fussy isn't an allergy. But being able to pay a well in excess of $100 per person for a meal ALSO buys you a certain amount of indulgence. Additionally, places like this with set menus will often ask customers at the time they book their reservation if you have any dietary restrictions or strong preferences. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with asking any restaurant, even a VERY fancy one with a fixed menu, if they can accommodate changes. At worst, you will be told 'no'.", "Your intentions are honourable but she already said no. Respect it. YWBTA.", "She expressed her wishes. Respect it.", "So it's about what you want not what she wants? Yta", "I would call and ask but not change anything.  If they would willingly do it, mention it again to your GF and go with that what she says then.", "As others have said, ywbta to go ahead and have them swapped out the cheese plate since your gf has asked you not to. Although it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to ask them if they\u2019re able to swap it out due to dietary restrictions and then let her make that decision herself if they can. Unrelated to the restaurant, but related to her overall dislike of cheese, maybe she should test for casein intolerance,  casein is a protein found in milk. Anecdotal, I\u2019ve always hated milk and most dairy products, and would only ever eat sheep or goat cheese and yoghurt, and as an adult finally got tested to find that I am intolerant to most cow dairy products \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "Why are you even here, she told you not to do it. Don\u2019t do it. Why do men seem to need other people to repeat for them what their SO already said. Show some respect. YTA because her words weren\u2019t enough for you.", "This is accurate! Don't control her by making the decision for her, but you can make the call to ask if it's possible, ask how much of an inconvenience it would cause to the staff, and if it would make anyone's job harder. \n\nYou don't have to explain which one of you dislikes cheese, if that's what she's worried about. \n\nIf you have gathered this information and she still chooses the cheese, let her have the cheese.", "Yeah I'm guessing they probably have alternatives because being lactose intolerant or having some sort of dairy allergy is fairly common.", "Every time I've gone to a Michelin starred restaurant with a degustation menu, they have asked if there are any allergies or intolerances. So the restaurant could definitely do it, especially if told ahead of time.", "Absolutely false.", "This has certainly never been my experience. And I\u2019d argue that\u2019s *not* why you go there. My friend and I requested a change halfway through a meal once when we realized we did not, in fact, like oysters and didn\u2019t want any more dishes with oysters in them. They prepared a delicious alternative happily. Since Michelin star restaurants have some of the best chefs and staff in the world and everything is made extremely fresh, it makes sense that they can accommodate people. Part of the fee of these restaurants is the world class service. I\u2019ve made requests for no shellfish (out of preference) for each one I\u2019ve ever been to (around five at this point) and had no issue", "I may be your husband (though I\u2019m definitely not!). Thankfully my husband would happily have double cheese so wouldn\u2019t be much of an issue, but I generally hate food waste and would normally just ask to skip that course rather than it just get binned. Maybe someone who works in the kitchen may get a cheese bonus from me!", "Bruh with my lactose intolerance, offering me an alternative is more for everyone around me than it is me. They know this.", "PLEASE please don't do anything. I'm the same way as your girlfriend and even though you THINK you're doing something nice just no... please listen to her lol", "Don't do something your partner had explicitly asked you not to. Simple.", "This can be a good reason to use OpenTable and the like to make reservations. My friends and I all do this because we list out what we are allergic to (mild to bad), what we don't LIKE, and what we prefer. And nearly every Michelin star restaurant, including the ones with set meals, sub out because a lot of chefs enjoy the challenge of coming up with something else.\n\nI'm allergic to shellfish (mild) so I often get a completely different little amuse bouche or starter than the almost always some damn thing with crab or shrimp. One friend dislikes the texture of nuts. One is allergic to dairy like milk but not butter. We are a fun bunch for sure, but we get some *amazing* meals at the nice restaurants.\n\nLuckily our city does a twice a year restaurant week where you can get a smaller set meal for much less than the usual price so we get to test out places we can't normally afford.", "There are NO SUBSTITUTIONS AT HAWTHORN!!!", "NTA I have similar anxieties as your girlfriend. She\u2019s too scared to displease, and she might realize that too. Calling the restaurant ahead and asking if a substitution is possible is not bothering anybody. They\u2019ll say yes or no and that\u2019s it. You can then transmit that info to your girlfriend and voil\u00e0. Next time, don\u2019t ask her just do it and give her the info. One step of potential anxiety entirely skipped.", "YWBTA since she specifically asked you not to, and I'm guessing would be mortified when she found out you did.\n\nIt would 100% be acceptable to do this otherwise. I'm sure 'I dont like cheese' is one of the easiest and least ridiculous requests they accommodate daily. 2+3 star places will generally bend over backward to make the guest happy. It's pretty much required to get the 2nd and 3rd stars.", "\u201cIt\u2019s for her own good\u201d means \u201cI don\u2019t trust her to know what\u2019s best for her\u201d. Or worse, \u201cI don\u2019t trust the decisions she makes\u201d.", "Maybe you can get her to agree to calling the restaurant to ask anonymously if they would do this at all without specifically mentioning your reservation, only mentioning your reservation if they say it would be fine. Quite a few people have dairy allergies or other food intolerances and even fine dining restaurants usually allow for some adjustments.", "I\u2019ve been to many one-, two- and three-star restaurants and several of the top 50s with my husband who, like your girlfriend, is disgusted by any cheese but mozzarella. The cheese course is very casual and often caters to each specific diner\u2019s tastes, and it\u2019s almost always optional. So your gf can pass and will be served something else or have an open course that I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be charged for. We\u2019ve had the same debate about telling vs not telling his cheese preferences and have decided not to after he missed out on some amazing courses because he said no cheese, considering restaurants like this tend to serve more balanced dishes rather than the overpowering cheeses that he hates.", "I can't eat dairy and fine dining restaurants are usually excellent at finding alternatives.", "Every single coursed meal I\u2019ve ever had, ranging from no stars to 3 stars, has begun with the server asking about dietary restrictions.", "YTA- just no. Do not bother the restaurant for this petty shit. It\u2019s not an allergy.", "If she may have a physical reaction, let the people fuckin know so they can accommodate her dietary restrictions. I love tasting menus and frequent Michelin star restaurants. If you just asked to change a course bc you don\u2019t like something, YTA and should just go eat somewhere else/skip that course, but you just said cheese has made her sick in the past. You\u2019re NTA, and I\u2019m sorry she is too anxious to advocate for herself.", "If she wants to cut the cheese, let her, lol", "Maybe she should do the research herself and call around. She is the one with food aversions. Is this place so fancy that you can\u2019t take leftovers for later? If not then you can eat the cheese that she doesn\u2019t want. This just sounds like rich people\u2019s problems.", "You both WBTA if you went to a 2 michelin star restaurant and your gf doesnt even touch the cheese plate or only tries a little and leaves the rest untouched (unless youre planning to eat two plates then you do you). It's a waste of food and effort by the chefs. \n\nThere is honestly no harm in asking the restaurant if its possible to swap it out. They would have received worse requests.", "No restaurant will earn 2 Michelin rosettes if it is unwilling to make a very easy accommodation like this.  And if called in advance they will happily do so. Girlfriend should not be worried about this causing undue grief to a server.\n\nHowever for OP to overrule her would be treating her like a child and would make OP the asshole.", "Nobody here has an allergy or intolerance", "But the point is that they have other options available to substitute, so it's unlikely they would refuse such a request.", "If I had that strong an aversion to a food, I'd consider that an intolerance. It's not \"technically\" an intolerance, as in it's not something you have issues digesting. But it sounds like OP's gf threw up after tasting blue cheese. I'd call that an intolerance. It's no one's business that the intolerance is to a flavor.", "Yes assuming the girlfriend wants to ask for one", "Correct. He shouldn't do it against her wishes."]}
