Which means ... because I don't know how common a prix fixe menu is  ... that you get a predetermined meal for a fixed price. For example, cheese plate, rack of lamb, choice of veg and dessert for, IDK, $100 per person. People go with prix fixe choices because they're often cheaper than ordering everything a la carte.  If this is the case, you should NOT ask the restaurant to switch out the cheese plate for something else. If you don't like what's offered on the prix fixe, shell out the extra $$$ to order everything a la carte.

Caveat: he stated that his capacity to forgive me is huge, so it depends on how you think your girlfriend would react!\n- as she has clearly stated that she doesn't want you to call and ask the question, then you definitely should NOT call. His reasoning: this is one course out of probably several, if there are crackers she can still eat them, you can eat the cheese. She isn't really missing out (if it were an issue with the entire meal, that would be different).\n- HOWEVER..... he also thinks your girlfriend is completely wrong: while turning up on the day and asking to make a change might be a mild annoyance to the staff, calling in advance is absolutely fine (and if they say no, see the reasoning in the point above).

If there\u2019s a strict \u201cno changes policy\u201d the restaurant can tell you in that call and you can proceed with the previous plan for her to attempt to try the cheeses.

I agree with everyone that you should not go behind your girlfriend\u2019s back and make changes as she should have the right to make the decision.", "As a foodie, I can tell you a restaurant like that will not be happy about menu changes.

Going outside those options is not really the \"done thing\" at fine dining restaurants.\n\nI would suggest just going and enjoying the experience. \nYour gf is OK with the menu, you both might be pleasantly surprised. \n\nA cheese course on a tasting menu is very small and can be anything. I once had an amazing grilled cheese toasty as a cheese course. Other places it's just been a choice of a couple small pieces of cheese with some dried fruit and jams. One place served a nut cheese.
