You and your wife are second rate according to her and her parents. Your wife\u2019s parents don\u2019t even recognize him as their grandchild, and yet still your wife sides with them in this matter? She wants to keep the peace?? What about her standing up for you and your son?", "NTA. (Editing to fix this because my sleep deprived ass used the wrong judgement acronym.)\n\nYour SIL wants to have her (homophobic) cake and eat it too - don't let her win. Tell her to fuck off. I honestly can't believe she expects you to participate in her special day when she openly condemned your relationship with your wife, refused to attend YOUR wedding and hasn't actually put in any effort to remedy the situation or be a part of your life. SIL isn't entitled to your son as a ring bearer just because she's related to your wife. And SIL shouldn't be allowed to pick and choose when to be nice and have you in her life to suit her needs.\n\nWhat makes me sad is that it sounds like your wife is willing to do anything to have her family in her life and be a part of their special moments, even if it means tolerating their homophobic ass beliefs. Your wife clearly loves her family despite what they've put both of you through. I feel like your wife has been putting issues on the back burner to avoid conflict with her family for a long time, so it may be all she knows.\n\n But you should not be expected to do the same; her family has made it clear how they feel about your relationship with your wife, and you are under no obligation to be nice to people who tell you you're going to burn in hell, even if they're your in-laws.\n\n I think your wife needs to realize that the way you feel about the situation matters, as it is also your child, and that you shouldn't be expected to set aside your feelings just to appease her family, especially when they've been so awful and disrespectful to you. You both shouldn't have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.\n\nMaybe ask your wife how she would feel if the roles were reversed, and it was your family doing this. Perhaps that would put things into perspective?", "NTA - Your child is not a prop! That\u2019s what it seems they view him as. A prop for photos. You\u2019ve already said they don\u2019t approve of your marriage, they don\u2019t recognize him as family, and the person who has repeatedly told you you\u2019re going to hell is the one that wants to use him. If they\u2019re comfortable being blatantly homophobic in front of you they aren\u2019t going to censor themselves in front of your son. I don\u2019t know how old he is, but he\u2019ll start to ask questions and understand eventually. Is your wife ok with that? I hope she is seeking therapy if that is an option for you or even a support group. I know some still hold zoom meetings, so maybe if there isn\u2019t one locally you could try that.", "NtTA - I'm sick of this must respect people's religious rights BS. If your religion requires bigotry, misogyny, or disrespect of other human beings *your religion is wrong.*", "NTA\n\nYour wife is willing to tolerate that her family discriminate her - not good, but ok, her choice.\n\nYour wife is willing to tolerate that her family discriminate her partner and children? Hell no. \n\nWhat are you gonna do when SIL or grandmother tell your son that his parents are perverts, they will go to hell, his a \"sin child\" and his family is not real family at all?", "NTA. Your sister is free to go, but I guess your SIL not only hurt her on your wedding day but also did she hurt and also discriminate you. Therefore I wouldn\u2019t go there either and I would expect an apology not only for your wife but for yourself too. And I think it\u2019s ridiculous that she somehow abandoned your family ever since and now wants your son to be the ring bearer because it\u2019s \u201ecute\u201c? Damn, your child is a human being and she thinks it\u2019s alright to use him for her wedding so everyone thinks she\u2019s the great bride by letting him being part of the wedding although her religion is against  your \u201elifestyle\u201c, I mean what the fuck. This is literally disgusting.", "NTA. Your SIL just wants to use your child because it is 'so cute' and not even because it is family. If your wife wants you to go to the wedding - okay. You might could get along with them for the ceremony. But don't let them use your child, who they not even acknowledge as their nephew or grandchild.", "NTA. This would be a real dealbreaker in any relationship I was in. If they can't accept a marriage I'm in then they are out of my life. It's a pity your wife wants to give in for the sake of peace, that's rarely an answer to this sort of problem. And if someone told me I'm going to hell that would be the exact same answer I would give in regards to this request. Hypocrites, don't you just love them?", "NTA never bow to AHs just to keep the peace", "Your wife desperately wants to have/keep a relationship with her family. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t realize they are insincere\u2026they only want all of you there so your son can be the cute ring bearer. Ask your wife what she thinks is going to happen after your son\u2019s performance in the wedding? Does she think all will be normal? Her own parents don\u2019t even acknowledge their grandchild! You say wife is in therapy\u2026maybe ask if the two of you can go together to discuss this particular issue. I\u2019m going to say NAH because I think your wife is hoping this is the thing that will fix her relationship with her family.", "NTA. Your son is not a prop.", "NAH (between you & your spouse, your inlaws are assholes). These situations are so difficult & I understand how she's being pulled in her heart.  \n\n\nBut it would be a cold day in hell before I let my son be around those people & you wouldn't be the asshole if you said your child can't participate. I have a family member I had to put my foot down & say I didn't want our child left alone with ever again because I couldn't trust them not to say really vile things to my kids. Things in the similar vein of \"you're not our real grandchild.\" Protecting my kids from that crap was more important than those people liking me or things never being awkward.", "NTA, you and your wife both have valid points. Her family is trash and cherry picking aspects of \"religion\" as an excuse to discrimate and be hateful. Wanting to tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine isn't an unreasonable response. \n\nBut, expecting anything by way of an apology from them is just going to raise hell for your wife, and ultimately if she's not ready or willing to cut ties with them it might just be better to keep the peace.\n\n**However, I don't agree with having your son be the ring bearer, he's not a part of this and shouldn't be put in the middle.** Demanding an apology from your wife's family? Not gonna get anywhere. Declining a request to use your son as an ornament in a wedding? Entirely reasonable, though will likely still start a fight.\n\nGood luck OP, family sucks sometimes.\n\n(edit to add bold around the last bit because it's apparently necessary)", "YTA, but only because you should do it for your wife.

Your wife is an adult and can choose harmful relationships if she wants (I'm glad she's working on this), but it's not ok to expose your son to their nonsense.

So if they want a cute ring bearer they should probably hire a child actor.\n\nIt would be different if they'd had a change of heart and wanted to treat you differently, and you're right to want some evidence of that in the form of an apology.\n\nWhy is your wife trying to keep the peace? There's no peace to keep, just open warfare.", "NTA. Stick to your decision. If your wife wants too  go fine. But not with you are your son. If she does attend maybe she should go for consoling.", "Your son is not a prop. NTA and stand your ground.", "Why would your son who doesn't exist to them, isn't part of their family and a product of \"sin\" be in their bigoted wedding? NTA. Who TF cares about peace, you and your son will never have peace as long as your wife allows this.", "NTA, why would you even go to a wedding where the bride believes you guys are basically from hell and or sinners? Obviously your son is also a sinner because he comes from gay parents. Stand your ground and don't go. You would be disrespecting yourself, your partner, and your son if you go and let him participate.\nIf she asks why are you not coming? Just tell her you know the reason.", "NTA\n\nWife needs a spine.", "NTA. This is a hill you should choose to die on. They're homophobic, you can't let them trot out your family when it's convenient for them.", "What peace? They have already wrecked the relationship with you and don't deserve one with your son. This is a no and your wife needs to accept that. NTA.", "You're not expecting people to go against their religious beliefs. They believe you're going to hell and don't want to acknowledge you as a part of the family, so you're staying away. How much more can you respect their beliefs?\n\nIf they want to start treating you like family, they have to put *their own* beliefs aside, and if they're willing to do that, an apology to you seems like a great place to start.\n\nNTA.", "Thank you!", "What peace could there be to keep?", "The kid also deserves to not experience a situation where people can be mean to his mom and still expect something from him when it suits them. No need to carry the religious trauma forward into the next generation."]}
