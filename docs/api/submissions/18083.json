We get along really well and I think my mom is jealous of her sometimes.\n\nProm was last weekend and I was at my dads for the weekend so he was taking me. I originally was going to wear a red dress that I bought with my own money. My stepmom pulled me aside before I was suppose to get ready and showed me her kimono she owned. She said if I want I could wear this if I want. It was gorgeous so I said yes\n\nWe had a good time getting me ready and I brought the other dress to wear during the main party. All the official pictures were taken in the kimono. I had a great times.\n\nMy mom got all pictures today and was not happy. She asked why the hell I would wear that and it wasn\u2019t appropriate. We got in an argument and I got grounded. I know she laid into my dad for it. I asked my friend (she has Japanese heritage) about what she thought of the dress and she wasn\u2019t happy with new wearing it either. AITA my mom and friend were unhappy.\n\nEdit: so my school has a large Asian population, just found out most people think I did this for attention since they don\u2019t know about my stepmom. Probably should have thought about that before hand so that gossip is gonna suck for a bit. Damage control it is\n\nOn a side note I now know why mom was so upset, basically she has been getting calls about it basically asking wtf, which makes her explain, which brings up the divorce and that stepmom is much younger.

A Japanese woman, with which you have a close, familial relationship offered you their kimono for a special occasion.  I don't think there is anything wrong with wearing a piece of clothing from another culture and being respectful of the attire and culture itself.  \n\nIf I had to guess, your mother is upset because she feels like she is losing you to your step-mother.  As for the friend, why would they be upset with what you wore to prom? Did you arrange to match? Or did they think you wearing the kimono was some form of cultural appropriation?", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, kimono is pretty much \"regular\" clothing with no deeper meaning (unlike Native American war chief's headdress for example). Aslong as you were acting \"normal\" and were not using it to perpetuate an ethnic stereotype, there is no issue.\n\nSecond, a freaking Japanese person was the one who offered it to you in the first place.\n\nYour biomom is a jealous asshole and the reason she is upset is because she hates idea of you getting close to your stepmom.", "I am also a non-Japanese person but I lived in Japan for a few years, took kimono kitsuke classes (the art of learning how to wear one) and have worn them several times. Solid NTA. This is a super fun thing and special thing that you got to do with your stepmom, and you are very lucky! Kimono are rarely worn even in Japan. They're usually just reserved for SUPER formal shit like weddings/coming of age ceremony/graduation (although the informal cotton version, yukata, are much more common at summer festivals).\n\nYour mom is just jealous quite frankly, and your Japanese friend probably just doesn't know the full context (that it was a special thing between you and your Japanese stepmom who offered in the first place).\n\nFun fact - you'll never look like you're out of style in those pictures. Kimono are pretty much forever. A poofy ugly prom dress, on the other hand...............", "NTA! There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with wearing something so precious to both you and your stepmom. Clearly your mom is just jealous", "NTA. You were given the kimono by a Japanese woman - your stepmother wanted you to wear it. That's enough of a permission to wear it.", "Why are the ppl who are not part of the culture the most upset about someone wearing something from another culture ? It was offered to you so the person from this culture felt proud to share her culture with you . Sharing culture gets ppl closer. There is obviously a difference between mocking another culture or appreciating differences variety and beauty", "NTA.  Anyone can wear a kimono.  Japanese people tend to encourage sharing of their culture.  There are plenty of people who are not Japanese who enjoy wearing or making kimonos.  The fact your stepmother gave it to you is all the acceptance you really need, if you feel you need any at all.  The only way I'd think YTA is if you wore it as a random cosplay or didn't respect the culture that is kimono wearing.  Seems like you are fine.", "NTA. You were literally offered a kimono by your stepmom. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nWear it because you and your stepmother like it. You were gifted it by a Japanese person.", "nta, your stepmom who you\u2019re close to is japanese and gave you teh lovely gift of letting you wear her kimono.  it\u2019s not inappropriate at all.", "NTA- wow. mom has a real issue.   What you did was not wrong. You wore what you found to be beautiful.  Your friend is most likely jealous.   Im sorry you got grounded for standing up for yourself.  Kimono IS formal wear so it totally is something you can wear to a prom!", "NTA. My best friend is currently on holiday in Japan and the hotels have their own hotel-issue kimono to be worn by guests. You were offered a kimono by a family member who loves you and wanted to share it with you. I bet you looked beautiful", "NTA. Americans are really weird about race.", "NTA. Your step-mom wanted and allowed you to wear something that means something to her. Your mom is jealous of her, and she is taking her feelings of her out on you. Your friend probably thought you were  culturally appropriating the kimono, but that friend doesn't understand the link to that outfit and how your step-mom's culture plays into it. There was no disrespect, and if your friend understands anything about many Asian cultures, respecting your elders is paramount.", "NTA, I don't think it's appropriation, your stepmom shared a part of her culture with you. There's nothing wrong with it IMO.", "NTA.  On the whole, wearing clothing which is from a different culture may be cultural appropriation.  And if someone who was Japanese got upset, well, I would at least think about that.\n\nBut in this case, a Japanese person with whom you have a personal relationship loaned you a.particular item for you to wear specifically.   That isn't cultural appropriation - that is a sweet gesture from your stepmother to you.", "NTA.  Your mom grounded you for wearing a gorgeous dress to prom??  Why on earth were people not happy?  If you looked good and felt good about what you were wearing, you are good.", "You even bought the dress,  so your mom doesn\u2019t have the excuse that you wasted her money. NTA\n\nThe friend isn\u2019t worth bothering about. \n\nYou mentioned that your mom was feeling jealous.  Talk to her about it.  People often react on instinct, and get stubborn.  Reassure her that her that a step, no matter how kind isn\u2019t going to replace her. \n\nMaybe ask her if she wants to get dressed up , and take pictures of the two of you in your original dress.  An hour of hair and makeup is well worth the effort.", "I can tell you already, you\u2019re NTA. If your stepmother initiated it, then that would be on her. Your mom being upset is her own problem. Now if your stepmom is actually Japanese, compared to your friend who has Japanese heritage(there is a difference), and your mom encouraged it, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem there, either.", "Unless you agreed to match with your friend, NTA. No way. A gift and option from the person within the culture for YOUR prom was presented and you both wore and appreciated it.", "NTA. You wore a beautiful kimono that was given to you as a gift to wear by a Japanese woman. Hers is only opinion that matters here.\n\nAs for \"standing out\"...yeah? That's why people buy extravagant prom dresses, so they can stand out. That's the point.", "Your friend might be of Japanese heritage but she's showing that she's not culturally Japanese.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with non-Japanese people wearing kimonos.  Go to Japan and you'll be asked and given some by locals because they want to see you wear then. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Wear what ever you want.", "NTA", "NTA It's just cloth who gives a fuck about someone else's clothes? What harm is that going to cause?", "NTA", "The unofficial rule with cultural appropriation is if a person from that culture gives you permission then it\u2019s ok.

Your mom is jealous that you wore your step mom's dress.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's your prom. Nobody else's", "NTA but I can see how this could look like cultural appropriation out of context. Your step mom made a nice gesture by offering the dress that means a lot to her for you to wear and that\u2019s what really matters. It\u2019s all the acceptance you need here.", "Prob NTA here considering the facts given. Could be ESH since I don't understand the motivations for the dress being offered or you accepting it. Speaking for myself, I would probably role my eyes if I saw someone with no ties to Japan rocking a kimono at all, much less to prom lol. At the end of the day if you liked it then that's cool and really the most important thing. But not expecting any eye rolls (i.e. sour grapes) is kinda naive.", "NTA", "NTA has your mother seen some of the outfits people wear to prom nowadays? Titties out, guys freeballing in silk pants, open chests with no button downs, exposed legs. These are all acceptable in today's society, and as for your friend I think if she has a cultural issue she should address your stepmother, not you. I bet you where the star of the prom wearing that lovely kimono, and your stepmother probably felt really excited for you and happy that you two are close.", "NTA but your mom and step-mom both are.\n\nYour step-mom set you up for criticism about cultural appropriation.  She was trying to get closer to you by offering you the kimono.  She was OK with it, but she failed to consider the feelings of other Japanese people, such as your friend.  \n\nYour mom is making a big deal about it because your step-mom was involved, and it makes it clear that you are getting closer to her.  Mom jealousy pure and simple.\n\nYes, you should have known better than to wear a traditional costume from a culture you are not part of.  But you were given bad advice from a trusted adult, so you aren't the a hole.", "NTA", "Esh it's not cultural appreciation. A Japanese person lent you their kimono. Also, the majority of Japanese people, not Japnese America, don't give a shit if non Japanese people wear kimono.  I did a study abroad and the older ladies seemed to love dressing me up like their own life sized Barbie doll. \n\n~~However, your mom had already bought you a dress so I'd be annoyed at the wasted money.~~\n\nYour step mom also kinda sucks bc why would she wait until literally the day of to offer?\n\nEdit mom didn't buy the dress, so there was no wasted money", "Yta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They also have only been married for a year so that doesn\u2019t help", "I'm not sure I agree that the stepmom is an AH here. To make a very general statement here, Japanese people in Japan tend to view non-Japanese people wearing traditional kimono/yukata as a compliment, as it's pleasing to see others take an interest in the beauty of their culture. In fact you can do formal photoshoots in places like Kyoto where people dress you up in kimono and take pictures for you as souvenirs, and also as a way of learning what it's like to style and wear a kimono (which is a very complicated garment). It's not really viewed as cultural appropriation in Japan.\n\nNow if the stepmom was raised in America where we have more nuanced ideas about cultural appropriation, I'd have a slightly different opinion here, but she just said the stepmom was Japanese, so I am guessing she was raised in Japan.", "Yeah I think I agree with that, it doesn\u2019t help people don\u2019t know my stepmom is Japanese.

You have a strong tie to Japan - your stepmother. The lack of willingness to acknowledge this strong tie is the problem.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Cultural appropriation is a really complicated area, but wearing a kimono that you were appropriately invited to wear is not it. What your mom is probably upset about is that your stepmom's role in your life was made visible to all, when she would prefer it didn't even exist.", "a) You did follow the dress code. The dress code is the black tie/formal dress. If it's a formal kimono, that is indeed a formal dress. I guess it was the colorful one with long sleeves? That's called furisode, and is indeed considered to be a very formal wear for a young lady. You can tell your mother that even Noble Prize committee considers kimonos to be formalwear. \n\nb) You do have ties to Japan. Your stepmother is Japanese. She is the one who welcomed you and offered you a kimono. Your mother is trying to invalidate this bond out of jealousy.", "But you are very close to your step-mother, who thought it would be amazing for you.

Google Gwen Stefani 2004.", "O. That changes things then!", "Yes, this is it exactly. Provided she didn\u2019t do any form of yellow face makeup or changing her hair, wearing the kimono was perfectly appropriate.

And this is why I was hesitant to post that.", "No they don\u2019t.

And Harajuku isn't \"traditional.\"  Her defense had to do with how her father \"traveled to Japan extensively\" and told her about their fashion.  Which is a lot flimsier than having a Japanese person offer you their kimono.\n\nMy point was that cultural appropriation has been an public issue since before OP was born.", "Not only loaned it, but first offered it, and then helped her get ready.\n\nJoyous bonding, and true blending of cultures.", "That\u2019s a good idea.", "I'm not disagreeing with your point but your examples are horrible, as they're two universally-worn types of attire.\n\nI can see why someone of Japanese descent would consider this cultural appropriation if they didn't have context, which OP admits she didn't provide. \n\nStill NTA tho.", "I don't think the root issue is whether Gwen Stefani was interested in traditional or non-traditional Japanese fashion. There's nothing wrong with non-Japanese people being inspired by Japanese street style.\n\nThe problem is that she profited off of it. She made \"Harajuku\" into her own brand. She created all of this merch and perfume and crap under the name Harajuku with dubious Japanese \"kawaii\" influences, hired Japanese backup dancers and turned them into her silent entourage, hell she even called her entire tour Harajuku Lovers Tour. She turned it into her identity while profiting off of it.\n\nNow, this all MAY have been slightly less nauseating if at any point Stefani demonstrated some kind of actual fascination with Japanese culture beyond plaid poofy skirts from Harajuku, but, no not really. She doesn't speak Japanese, she was not formally educated on anything related to Japan or East Asian studies, she does not have Japanese family members (like OP), I doubt she has any experience living in Japan beyond being there on vacation or for touring. So the whole thing was really gross. Just reinforced stereotypes about Asian women being cute and silent while Gwen the white lady got to be the center of the stage and profited massively off of a foreign culture she clearly had nothing but superficial, tenuous connections to.\n\nAnyway hope you don't mind my rant hahaha. TLDR Gwen Stefani was a WAY worse example of cultural appropriation than a local girl wearing a kimono to prom that her Japanese stepmother lent her.", "But really the Japanese American friend doesn't need the whole story.", "Even W/o contect. IDC if OP bought it in a thrift shop. Cry more.", "I agree what Stefani did was way worse.  I'm not even calling OP the AH here, while Stefani definitely was.\n\nMy sole reason for the Stefani reference is that it is memorable to me 19 years later, and we are long past the time when adults should be able to claim ignorance of the concept of cultural appropriation."]}
