We get along really well and I think my mom is jealous of her sometimes.\n\nProm was last weekend and I was at my dads for the weekend so he was taking me. I originally was going to wear a red dress that I bought with my own money. My stepmom pulled me aside before I was suppose to get ready and showed me her kimono she owned. She said if I want I could wear this if I want. It was gorgeous so I said yes\n\nWe had a good time getting me ready and I brought the other dress to wear during the main party. All the official pictures were taken in the kimono. I had a great times.\n\nMy mom got all pictures today and was not happy. She asked why the hell I would wear that and it wasn\u2019t appropriate. We got in an argument and I got grounded. I know she laid into my dad for it. I asked my friend (she has Japanese heritage) about what she thought of the dress and she wasn\u2019t happy with new wearing it either. AITA my mom and friend were unhappy.\n\nEdit: so my school has a large Asian population, just found out most people think I did this for attention since they don\u2019t know about my stepmom. Probably should have thought about that before hand so that gossip is gonna suck for a bit. Damage control it is\n\nOn a side note I now know why mom was so upset, basically she has been getting calls about it basically asking wtf, which makes her explain, which brings up the divorce and that stepmom is much younger.

A Japanese woman, with which you have a close, familial relationship offered you their kimono for a special occasion.  I don't think there is anything wrong with wearing a piece of clothing from another culture and being respectful of the attire and culture itself.  \n\nIf I had to guess, your mother is upset because she feels like she is losing you to your step-mother.  As for the friend, why would they be upset with what you wore to prom? Did you arrange to match? Or did they think you wearing the kimono was some form of cultural appropriation?", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, kimono is pretty much \"regular\" clothing with no deeper meaning (unlike Native American war chief's headdress for example). Aslong as you were acting \"normal\" and were not using it to perpetuate an ethnic stereotype, there is no issue.\n\nSecond, a freaking Japanese person was the one who offered it to you in the first place.\n\nYour biomom is a jealous asshole and the reason she is upset is because she hates idea of you getting close to your stepmom.", "I am also a non-Japanese person but I lived in Japan for a few years, took kimono kitsuke classes (the art of learning how to wear one) and have worn them several times. Solid NTA. This is a super fun thing and special thing that you got to do with your stepmom, and you are very lucky! Kimono are rarely worn even in Japan. They're usually just reserved for SUPER formal shit like weddings/coming of age ceremony/graduation (although the informal cotton version, yukata, are much more common at summer festivals).\n\nYour mom is just jealous quite frankly, and your Japanese friend probably just doesn't know the full context (that it was a special thing between you and your Japanese stepmom who offered in the first place).\n\nFun fact - you'll never look like you're out of style in those pictures. Kimono are pretty much forever. A poofy ugly prom dress, on the other hand...............", "NTA! There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with wearing something so precious to both you and your stepmom. Clearly your mom is just jealous", "NTA. You were given the kimono by a Japanese woman - your stepmother wanted you to wear it. That's enough of a permission to wear it.", "Why are the ppl who are not part of the culture the most upset about someone wearing something from another culture ? It was offered to you so the person from this culture felt proud to share her culture with you . Sharing culture gets ppl closer. There is obviously a difference between mocking another culture or appreciating differences variety and beauty", "NTA.  Anyone can wear a kimono.  Japanese people tend to encourage sharing of their culture.  There are plenty of people who are not Japanese who enjoy wearing or making kimonos.  The fact your stepmother gave it to you is all the acceptance you really need, if you feel you need any at all.  The only way I'd think YTA is if you wore it as a random cosplay or didn't respect the culture that is kimono wearing.  Seems like you are fine.", "NTA. You were literally offered a kimono by your stepmom. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nWear it because you and your stepmother like it. You were gifted it by a Japanese person.", "nta, your stepmom who you\u2019re close to is japanese and gave you teh lovely gift of letting you wear her kimono.  it\u2019s not inappropriate at all.", "NTA- wow. mom has a real issue.   What you did was not wrong. You wore what you found to be beautiful.  Your friend is most likely jealous.   Im sorry you got grounded for standing up for yourself.  Kimono IS formal wear so it totally is something you can wear to a prom!", "NTA. My best friend is currently on holiday in Japan and the hotels have their own hotel-issue kimono to be worn by guests. You were offered a kimono by a family member who loves you and wanted to share it with you. I bet you looked beautiful", "NTA. Americans are really weird about race.", "NTA. Your step-mom wanted and allowed you to wear something that means something to her. Your mom is jealous of her, and she is taking her feelings of her out on you. Your friend probably thought you were  culturally appropriating the kimono, but that friend doesn't understand the link to that outfit and how your step-mom's culture plays into it. There was no disrespect, and if your friend understands anything about many Asian cultures, respecting your elders is paramount.", "NTA, I don't think it's appropriation, your stepmom shared a part of her culture with you. There's nothing wrong with it IMO.", "NTA.  On the whole, wearing clothing which is from a different culture may be cultural appropriation.  And if someone who was Japanese got upset, well, I would at least think about that.\n\nBut in this case, a Japanese person with whom you have a personal relationship loaned you a.particular item for you to wear specifically.   That isn't cultural appropriation - that is a sweet gesture from your stepmother to you.", "NTA.  Your mom grounded you for wearing a gorgeous dress to prom??  Why on earth were people not happy?  If you looked good and felt good about what you were wearing, you are good.", "You even bought the dress,  so your mom doesn\u2019t have the excuse that you wasted her money. NTA\n\nThe friend isn\u2019t worth bothering about. \n\nYou mentioned that your mom was feeling jealous.  Talk to her about it.  People often react on instinct, and get stubborn.  Reassure her that her that a step, no matter how kind isn\u2019t going to replace her. \n\nMaybe ask her if she wants to get dressed up , and take pictures of the two of you in your original dress.  An hour of hair and makeup is well worth the effort.", "I can tell you already, you\u2019re NTA. If your stepmother initiated it, then that would be on her. Your mom being upset is her own problem. Now if your stepmom is actually Japanese, compared to your friend who has Japanese heritage(there is a difference), and your mom encouraged it, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem there, either.", "Unless you agreed to match with your friend, NTA. No way. A gift and option from the person within the culture for YOUR prom was presented and you both wore and appreciated it.", "NTA. You wore a beautiful kimono that was given to you as a gift to wear by a Japanese woman. Hers is only opinion that matters here.\n\nAs for \"standing out\"...yeah? That's why people buy extravagant prom dresses, so they can stand out. That's the point.", "Your friend might be of Japanese heritage but she's showing that she's not culturally Japanese.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with non-Japanese people wearing kimonos.  Go to Japan and you'll be asked and given some by locals because they want to see you wear then. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA.

What harm is that going to cause?", "NTA", "The unofficial rule with cultural appropriation is if a person from that culture gives you permission then it\u2019s ok.

Your mom is jealous that you wore your step mom's dress.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's your prom. Nobody else's", "NTA but I can see how this could look like cultural appropriation out of context. Your step mom made a nice gesture by offering the dress that means a lot to her for you to wear and that\u2019s what really matters. It\u2019s all the acceptance you need here.", "Prob NTA here considering the facts given. Could be ESH since I don't understand the motivations for the dress being offered or you accepting it. Speaking for myself, I would probably role my eyes if I saw someone with no ties to Japan rocking a kimono at all, much less to prom lol. At the end of the day if you liked it then that's cool and really the most important thing. But not expecting any eye rolls (i.e. sour grapes) is kinda naive.", "NTA", "NTA has your mother seen some of the outfits people wear to prom nowadays? Titties out, guys freeballing in silk pants, open chests with no button downs, exposed legs. These are all acceptable in today's society, and as for your friend I think if she has a cultural issue she should address your stepmother, not you. I bet you where the star of the prom wearing that lovely kimono, and your stepmother probably felt really excited for you and happy that you two are close.", "NTA but your mom and step-mom both are.\n\nYour step-mom set you up for criticism about cultural appropriation.  She was trying to get closer to you by offering you the kimono.  She was OK with it, but she failed to consider the feelings of other Japanese people, such as your friend.  \n\nYour mom is making a big deal about it because your step-mom was involved, and it makes it clear that you are getting closer to her.  Mom jealousy pure and simple.\n\nYes, you should have known better than to wear a traditional costume from a culture you are not part of.  But you were given bad advice from a trusted adult, so you aren't the a hole.", "NTA", "Esh it's not cultural appreciation. A Japanese person lent you their kimono. Also, the majority of Japanese people, not Japnese America, don't give a shit if non Japanese people wear kimono.  I did a study abroad and the older ladies seemed to love dressing me up like their own life sized Barbie doll. \n\n~~However, your mom had already bought you a dress so I'd be annoyed at the wasted money.~~\n\nYour step mom also kinda sucks bc why would she wait until literally the day of to offer?\n\nEdit mom didn't buy the dress, so there was no wasted money", "Yta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In fact you can do formal photoshoots in places like Kyoto where people dress you up in kimono and take pictures for you as souvenirs, and also as a way of learning what it's like to style and wear a kimono (which is a very complicated garment). It's not really viewed as cultural appropriation in Japan.\n\nNow if the stepmom was raised in America where we have more nuanced ideas about cultural appropriation, I'd have a slightly different opinion here, but she just said the stepmom was Japanese, so I am guessing she was raised in Japan.", "Yeah I think I agree with that, it doesn\u2019t help people don\u2019t know my stepmom is Japanese.

You have a strong tie to Japan - your stepmother. The lack of willingness to acknowledge this strong tie is the problem.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.

The dress code is the black tie/formal dress. If it's a formal kimono, that is indeed a formal dress. I guess it was the colorful one with long sleeves? That's called furisode, and is indeed considered to be a very formal wear for a young lady. You can tell your mother that even Noble Prize committee considers kimonos to be formalwear. \n\nb) You do have ties to Japan. Your stepmother is Japanese.

There's nothing wrong with non-Japanese people being inspired by Japanese street style.\n\nThe problem is that she profited off of it. She made \"Harajuku\" into her own brand. She created all of this merch and perfume and crap under the name Harajuku with dubious Japanese \"kawaii\" influences, hired Japanese backup dancers and turned them into her silent entourage, hell she even called her entire tour Harajuku Lovers Tour. She turned it into her identity while profiting off of it.\n\nNow, this all MAY have been slightly less nauseating if at any point Stefani demonstrated some kind of actual fascination with Japanese culture beyond plaid poofy skirts from Harajuku, but, no not really. She doesn't speak Japanese, she was not formally educated on anything related to Japan or East Asian studies, she does not have Japanese family members (like OP), I doubt she has any experience living in Japan beyond being there on vacation or for touring. So the whole thing was really gross. Just reinforced stereotypes about Asian women being cute and silent while Gwen the white lady got to be the center of the stage and profited massively off of a foreign culture she clearly had nothing but superficial, tenuous connections to.\n\nAnyway hope you don't mind my rant hahaha.

Having feelings is fine.  Being conflicted is fine.  \n\nMaking statements that it's against the culture when it's widely accepted by that original culture is not fine.

That's no different than being upset that native foods that are readily shared got spread.   \n\nNow if someone wanted to be upset that something happened on a smaller subset of that culture, then that's reasonable.  For example it would be normal to be upset at changing a regional recipe to something and claiming its authentic.   The friend could speak towards OP wearing the kimono being less acceptable in her subculture she experiences.   \n\nBut non-Japanese people wearing kimonos is as acceptable in the root culture as eating peanut butter in Europe is.

THAT'S cultural appropriation. It's a real thing - the term is just WILDLY misunderstood.\n\nIt is not a term that applies to gifts from members of that culture, or applies when someone is financially supporting members of that culture.

It isn't.\n\nI have spoken to quite a few Japanese people, enough to know many Japanese people tend to like it when they are able to export their culture. There's a couple of Japanese cultural festivals where I live, and it seems that they are pretty open to sharing their culture. Those who I have spoken to see it as continuity, and growth. And they appreciate it when the beauty of the cultural items, such as kimonos, are appreciated and are worn. Because even if the person wearing it does not appreciate it, someone will. And it still will be out there for the world to see.\n\nAlso, the making of traditional Kimonos is dying out  (just one example: [https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/kimonos-a-dying-art/2007050834590](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/kimonos-a-dying-art/2007050834590)). In order for there to be supply , at least in this case, there has to be demand. Lovers of traditional Kimonos around the world buy and trade in such a way that the market for these kimonos remain alive.  I don't know if your friend with Japanese heritage actually knows that.  And as a person of mixed cultures and history, I don't know enough about, let's say Chilean people to say what the people in Chile wear traditionally or know how people in Chile would feel about someone outside their culture wearing their traditional clothes.\n\nIronically, I know more about Japanese culture than any of the cultures in my history. SO, yeah.\n\nEdit: Just be clear - I mostly deal with Japanese people from Japan. I have encountered 2nd and 3rd generation Japanese people living in the States, but culture wasn't usually the topic of discussion. I imagine that it would be quite different for those living in the States - because I have seen a lot of sucky racist, fetishist ideas from this side of the house. \n\nAlso, just because I know Japanese people doesn't mean I know what every one of them feels about Kimonos, and other cultural things being shared with those foreign to the culture.", "Frankly, there would be nothing wrong with it even if her stepmom wasn't Japanese. White people are allowed to wear kimonos.", "Assuming OP is in the US. The reason why is right now in the US anyway, \"Cultural Appropriation\" is all the \"rage\" to be a hot button issue on.\n\nNo one seems to care, or understand Cultural Appreciation, which is in essence what we have happening here now. Kimonos are not \"gatekept\" part of culture. It's the most common gift when you visit places like Japan.\n\nA good example of this would be [https://www.boredpanda.com/girl-accuses-sony-cultural-appropriation-shakuhachi-bamboo-flute-cornelius-boots/](https://www.boredpanda.com/girl-accuses-sony-cultural-appropriation-shakuhachi-bamboo-flute-cornelius-boots/) \n\nThis is a \"outrage\" that happened when Sony had Cornelius Boots in a traditional Japanese garb playing a traditional Japanese instrument. One of the few masters of said instrument, the shakuhachi.", "They are probably in America and do not want to draw attention to their Asian heritage. This is typical. It might make them self-conscious. They just want to be accepted and not just seen be seen as Asian. They believe dressing Western would make them identify as American.", "I'm so glad this is the top comment. OP is NTA. People love getting mad about shit without bothering to understand the context and reasoning for a person's actions.", "Agreed. There's actually a huge non profit in Japan that focuses on spreading kimono and kitsuke outside Japan. We run a small club in Canada for them. There's hundreds of the clubs now where people can learn and share kimono. There's a club in most cities in Europe and North America. It's super fun and interesting to learn about. \n\nJapanese kimono artisans and the industry LOVE that kimono is international. For kimono to be sustained and the art form to continue they want change, new people interested and practising, and international buyers. \n\nThe only way it's appropriation is if someone wears a cheap fake kimono or some kind of odd cosplay that's disrespectful.", "True but read the update/edit, a lot of people from the culture in the school disliked as well\u2026", "People shouldn\u2019t get offended on the behalf of other people.", "[deleted]", "Humans are really weird about race. It's not just an American thing.", "Also going to disagree with this comment. They are in Japan, hence they are going to want to see you in local culture wear.\n\nHowever, if a Japanese-American/Canadians/etc does not greenlight every occasion as a time to wear a kimono, that does not make them culturally less nor does that make their experiences less valid.", "If you had very big ties it would be more like a Korean hanbok, no? \n\nJoking. Your stepmother gifted this to you, it's a big and special connection. You'll remember your connection with her when you're looking at these pictures decades from now.", "If anything, it shows a great level of bonding and respect between you both that your stepmother offered it to you to wear. \n\nI think it's a good thing that people are trying to have conversations about culture and appropriation because of how harmful it can be.\n\nBut as people say, context matters and there is a difference between appropriation and appreciation. In your case, I think it is a good example of allowing people from different cultural backgrounds to bond and share what they find beautiful and important. Positive and respectful cultural exchange is a good thing!\n\nIt sounds like your mom is triggered (which is valid, for her), but that's not your responsibility to fix and as for the Asian kids at school, they just don't understand the context. But I'm sure many of them have been hurt by people who have appropriated their cultures before and instead of stressing yourself out more or putting yourself on the defensive when you don't need to be by thinking of it as damage control, think of it instead as just showing that you are a good ally by making it clear what you did came from a place of respect and appreciation, not appropriation.\n\nEdit: I'm generally very sensitive to cultural appropriation due to bad experiences as a kid with my own culture, as well as what other friends have been through too with their cultures. This story is not one of those that makes me want to throw hands.", "your stepmom let you borrow it- I see no issues. maybe if she hadn't and you just happened to find and wear it then yeah, but this woman you have a close relationship to let you wear something deeply important from her heritage...so nta", "Fuck all of that noise. A person from the culture that is legally your family invited you to wear it. That\u2019s not cultural appropriation. It\u2019s cultural *amalgamation* and amalgamation is a beautiful thing. You\u2019re a more cultured person for it. The world is ours and we all deserve to partake in everything humanity has to offer.\n\nThat\u2019s why they call america a melting pot. \n\nYour mom is just jealous that you\u2019re forming a relationship with your step mom. It\u2019s totally normal, and you can just ignore her as much as possible when she\u2019s able to ground you, but maybe question how that\u2019s supposed to help her relationship with you in the end.\n\nYou are not the asshole. Damage control at school and let people know your Japanese step mom (yes, specify) invited you to wear it and that you\u2019re learning the culture.\n\nThen go learn some more culture.", "When I went to Japan on exchange, one of the first things my host family did was take me out for a formal photo in a kimono with my hair and makeup done. It was a wonderful experience for which I am very grateful! I can't imagine how I would have felt if, when I'd gone back, people had insulted me and said I had no right to wear it.\n\nThat said, the lived experience of racism by those living in hegemonically white countries is different and as others have said a lot more complex. I feel for OP and she's not the AH at all; it saddens me that she's being demonized by others even after explaining, too. But I can't fault people for their initial reaction either!", "I think they mean more that it doesn\u2019t hold any religious or ceremonial significance that would make it inherently wrong for someone not of a certain ethnicity or status to wear it (such as a Native American war bonnet).  \u201cKimono\u201d literally means \u201cclothes\u201d, and while it\u2019s not worn daily in Japan by most people now, there\u2019s nothing about the garment that precludes anyone from wearing them.", "People go shopping in kimonos all the time. Granted, they are very plain material 'regular' style kimonos, not the intricate designed ones you see. It's usually older women, but it's common enough. It also might be a more rural thing to do", "How you react to it makes you an asshole. No mature adult acts this way. It's beyond childish, and frankly baffling if she actually cares about her daughter. Parents are supposed to love and support their kids unconditionally; not only if they never get close to another middle-aged woman.", "\nWow, a non Japanese person trying to police what a Japanese person has to say about the kimono, even as I defended a non Japanese person wearing it in an appropriate context! Have you considered kicking rocks?", "No, Americans are extra sensitive about it. Cultural appropriation etc.", "By who? Chinese would call it spring festival.", "If we're going to be strictly pedantic in our chastisement, it really should be Spring Festival, since that is what it's called in China.", ">AND the experience of first and second (or sometimes more) generation American Japanese peeps is different than that of Japanese people living in Japan. \n\nThis is so important! But I also think it doesn't really matter in this situation as far as OP's intent goes.\n\nBut I think it's fair for the Asian-Americans to feel some kind of way about it. It should have been expressed in a better way by them and their families, though.", "The experiences of Americans and Canadians of Japanese heritage are indeed very different from the experiences of someone who grows up in Japan.\n\nBut regardless of how they feel watching someone without (apparent) Japanese heritage engage in (appropriately respectful) cultural activities, that feeling doesn't justify harassment and abuse. That feeling merits compassion and empathy, but it doesn't mean the person whose actions provoked that feeling did anything wrong.\n\nIn other words, the other students aren't wrong to feel the way they feel...but once it graduated to harassing the family over it, that crossed a line into inappropriate behavior, especially when they had no information on which to base their snap judgements about OP's decision to wear the kimono. I can understand them being angry, especially when they don't have context, but BEING angry and ACTING on that anger in abusive ways are two very different things. The latter places them into AH territory regardless of how understandable their feelings might be.", "Are all the Asian people Japanese people? Because each culture views these sort of things differently.", "Fuckin preach. HAPA to HAPA, I hate these kinds of bullshit. Asian Americans have very different experiences with White/western people  than do people living in Asia, and that will shape our perspectives.", "Hear me out: each time you were invited to partake in cultural attire, you were in the country of origin where the context is understood and accepted by the majority. (When in Rome, yadda yadda)\n\nIn cases like this, OP was invited but the context is unclear and not understood by the majority. Japanese stepmom and OP thinking you can just wear anything super fancy to prom, Japanese friend probably growing up and thinking kimonos are for significant events and prom is more of a dress-up party, and peers generally  wondering why a traditional Japanese garb was worn to what I'm guessing is a Western prom.\n\nI don't think OP had any malicious intent, but that's just my take.", "As a white person, I have no clue what the meanings of any of these are.  If a Japanese woman gave me a kimono and said I should wear it to a party with a high population of Japanese people, I would decline so people don't look at me weird.\n\nOP is clearly NTA but a little naive that other people wouldn't think it's weird.\n\nAlso, I'm a dude so it might be weirder for me.", "I\u2019m offended that you\u2019re offended. Where is *your* manager?!", "Jeez, careful you might hurt yourself with that reach.", "Those people need to mind their business to be honest. I find it frustrating that people with families of multiple cultures have to justify their cultural appreciation, or scenarios like OP's, to those who either don't have the full story, or simply don't care to know the story and will attack people like OP because it gives them internet brownie/karma points.", "I don't think jer mom is doing that, she is just saying that to make OP feel bad and blaming the stepmother.", "Her friend is of Japanese descent. That may mean her mother is from Japan or her 12-th great grandmother. It may mean she\u2019s worn a kimono all her life or never at all.\n\nAlso, no matter what the friends connection, it\u2019s not the same as the stepmother who is the owner of the article of clothing. Oh, and also from Japan, not of descent. \n\nThe other Asians? Are they Japanese? \n\nNot all Asians think the same on this. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge issue in several groups in which I am a member about whether or not all the different Asian groups can actually work and lobby together given both the cultural differences and the history. And whether or not non-Asian allies can and should be part of the groups, in leadership roles, etc. \n\nSo it\u2019s far from settled in the activist communities who gets to speak on these issues, when, and how. \n\nMaybe stepmom needs to go do a presentation on the kimono for the school. Could clear up a few things. \n\nThat is, presuming there are actual issues and not simply something Mom is drumming up b/c she\u2019s jealous. \n\nPersonally, I have been gifted quite a few very nice articles of traditional Japanese clothing. Including a quite historically significant Obi. Every Japanese person who knows of it and all the Japanese Americans and Americans of Japanese descent are thrilled and happy I have it. \n\nThe ONLY people who have ever said anything were non-Japanese Asians and some very vinegary white women. I ask them all where they got their expertise on the history and appropriate use of the Obi. That pretty much shuts them up.", "Japanese people are fine with it. It's only Japanese-descended Americans that want to gatekeep Japanese-ness.", "I've always felt that a lot of people from other cultures are thrilled when somebody else shows.interest in their culture. As long as it's done in a respectful manor and not mocking that culture then go for it. \n\nSlightly related: I'm a middle aged white guy and when I went to Korea and went to a bunch of kpop shows with my Asian wife I stood out like a sore thumb, however people were always so welcoming and glad that somebody clearly from a different culture was interested in their culture.", "That's when you just double down into a real argument and bring up Taiwan. \n\nSame bullshit tactics Russia does when it tries to claim everything Slavic as Russian.", "Great that you wouldn't get mad about jeans, you must recognise there is a different power dynamic due to the fact that white people colonized India for hundreds of years, killing, looting and generally enslaving a nation.", "No I don\u2019t think it matters so much here. OPs edit says she\u2019s aware of that she might have to address their feelings in person. I was replying to people saying her peers have no right to have opinions.", "From what I understand, and I could be wrong here, but its fairly common for Japanese people to give kimonos as gifts to non japanese people when they visit Japan.", "Also really nice kimono can be so expensive!\n\nSo there\u2019s also a level of trust in letting her wear what is presumably a very nice kimono if it was appropriate for prom as most proms are semi-formal at the least and majority are formal.", "Agreed. It\u2019s ok to appreciate and celebrate other cultures. We\u2019re all so easily offended.", "OP indicated that she witnessed her mom getting calls and having to defend OP, so I'm going to go with what OP witnessed.", "\u201c It's only Japanese-descended Americans that want to gatekeep Japanese-ness.\u201d\n\nThis is ABSOLUTELY untrue. A large chunk of my extended family is Japanese American. In the multiple decades I\u2019ve been deeply embedded in the community, I have never, ever had any of them accuse anyone else of cultural appropriation for wearing a kimono, happi coat, etc. Not once. \n\nNow, what I have seen is plenty of white people or other Asians say things about kimonos. It may well be that the friend that made a comment is white knighting without having a deep cultural tie. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen both Japanese friends and family AND \\[j\\]apanese American and Japanese \\[a\\]Americans\\* get upset with people dressed as geishas for halloween, with people wearing kimonos with kamon, people wearing religious symbolism, etc.\n\nA kimono is not something that would per se cause a reaction. Some iterations would And would be appropriative.\n\n\\*If  any of you don\u2019t automatically know the difference between big J, little A and big A, little J, in terms of culture and history then this isn\u2019t something you should be commenting on. Not all Americans of Japanese descent share a common history. It\u2019s not as simple as to divide this between Japanese born in Japan and those who were born and live in the USA now. There is a huge cultural difference between  big J, little A and big A, little J but also between the big A, little J who are Issei, Nisei, Sansei and the generations that have now followed. \n\nSo anyone lumping all these different groups and generations into one hopper is really, really oversimplifying a very complex history and very different people with very different POVs. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAll this being said, she was told by her Japanese step-mother this was ok and encouraged to do so.

If you went wearing a hanbok, maybe it's comparable.", "Surely any Japanese dispora in western countries count?", "Also English, Millennial, and I thiiiink it's only relatively recently it's become understood as pejorative? It can certainly be used like that (can think of a lot of examples in English literature with negative connotations or portrayal of a character), but would also have been used without negative intent - my grandmother used to claim we had 'g**** blood' (we have no proof at all of the truth of that, she may have just thought it was romantic or been mistaken, although we do have some darker colouring than is typical), and while she probably shouldn't have said so, she wasn't saying it thinking it was a slur, either - not meaning to say that makes it Ok to use, either, just that it wasn't pejorative by default? Or it was used to describe the opera heroine Carmen (of course racial/cultural prejudice and fetishisation is a part of her tragic story), or refer to 'g**** caravans'. The older generation also sometimes don't know the term Native American is used now so I guess I thought it was similar, maybe less negative than the older term there, even? (again not saying it's Ok for non-Roma people to use)\n\nGenerally deciding to give someone a random lecture like that, without trying to engage with them, is super-Americanised anyway. Once I learnt it could be considered a slur by some Roma people I've just aimed to spread awareness of that when I heard it used.

It\u2019s still Spring by the Japanese calendar. So you are two weeks early.\u201d Now this was a person who really knew the various patterns and traditions.
