We get along really well and I think my mom is jealous of her sometimes.\n\nProm was last weekend and I was at my dads for the weekend so he was taking me. I originally was going to wear a red dress that I bought with my own money. My stepmom pulled me aside before I was suppose to get ready and showed me her kimono she owned. She said if I want I could wear this if I want. It was gorgeous so I said yes\n\nWe had a good time getting me ready and I brought the other dress to wear during the main party. All the official pictures were taken in the kimono. I had a great times.\n\nMy mom got all pictures today and was not happy. She asked why the hell I would wear that and it wasn\u2019t appropriate. We got in an argument and I got grounded. I know she laid into my dad for it. I asked my friend (she has Japanese heritage) about what she thought of the dress and she wasn\u2019t happy with new wearing it either. AITA my mom and friend were unhappy.\n\nEdit: so my school has a large Asian population, just found out most people think I did this for attention since they don\u2019t know about my stepmom. Probably should have thought about that before hand so that gossip is gonna suck for a bit. Damage control it is\n\nOn a side note I now know why mom was so upset, basically she has been getting calls about it basically asking wtf, which makes her explain, which brings up the divorce and that stepmom is much younger.

A Japanese woman, with which you have a close, familial relationship offered you their kimono for a special occasion.  I don't think there is anything wrong with wearing a piece of clothing from another culture and being respectful of the attire and culture itself.  \n\nIf I had to guess, your mother is upset because she feels like she is losing you to your step-mother.  As for the friend, why would they be upset with what you wore to prom? Did you arrange to match? Or did they think you wearing the kimono was some form of cultural appropriation?", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, kimono is pretty much \"regular\" clothing with no deeper meaning (unlike Native American war chief's headdress for example). Aslong as you were acting \"normal\" and were not using it to perpetuate an ethnic stereotype, there is no issue.\n\nSecond, a freaking Japanese person was the one who offered it to you in the first place.\n\nYour biomom is a jealous asshole and the reason she is upset is because she hates idea of you getting close to your stepmom.", "I am also a non-Japanese person but I lived in Japan for a few years, took kimono kitsuke classes (the art of learning how to wear one) and have worn them several times. Solid NTA. This is a super fun thing and special thing that you got to do with your stepmom, and you are very lucky! Kimono are rarely worn even in Japan. They're usually just reserved for SUPER formal shit like weddings/coming of age ceremony/graduation (although the informal cotton version, yukata, are much more common at summer festivals).\n\nYour mom is just jealous quite frankly, and your Japanese friend probably just doesn't know the full context (that it was a special thing between you and your Japanese stepmom who offered in the first place).\n\nFun fact - you'll never look like you're out of style in those pictures. Kimono are pretty much forever. A poofy ugly prom dress, on the other hand...............", "NTA! There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with wearing something so precious to both you and your stepmom. Clearly your mom is just jealous", "NTA. You were given the kimono by a Japanese woman - your stepmother wanted you to wear it. That's enough of a permission to wear it.", "Why are the ppl who are not part of the culture the most upset about someone wearing something from another culture ? It was offered to you so the person from this culture felt proud to share her culture with you . Sharing culture gets ppl closer. There is obviously a difference between mocking another culture or appreciating differences variety and beauty", "NTA.  Anyone can wear a kimono.  Japanese people tend to encourage sharing of their culture.  There are plenty of people who are not Japanese who enjoy wearing or making kimonos.  The fact your stepmother gave it to you is all the acceptance you really need, if you feel you need any at all.  The only way I'd think you would be the issue is if you wore it as a random cosplay or didn't respect the culture that is kimono wearing.  Seems like you are fine.", "NTA. You were literally offered a kimono by your stepmom. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nWear it because you and your stepmother like it. You were gifted it by a Japanese person.", "nta, your stepmom who you\u2019re close to is japanese and gave you teh lovely gift of letting you wear her kimono.  it\u2019s not inappropriate at all.", "NTA- wow. mom has a real issue.   What you did was not wrong. You wore what you found to be beautiful.  Your friend is most likely jealous.   Im sorry you got grounded for standing up for yourself.  Kimono IS formal wear so it totally is something you can wear to a prom!", "NTA. My best friend is currently on holiday in Japan and the hotels have their own hotel-issue kimono to be worn by guests. You were offered a kimono by a family member who loves you and wanted to share it with you. I bet you looked beautiful", "NTA. Americans are really weird about race.", "NTA. Your step-mom wanted and allowed you to wear something that means something to her. Your mom is jealous of her, and she is taking her feelings of her out on you. Your friend probably thought you were  culturally appropriating the kimono, but that friend doesn't understand the link to that outfit and how your step-mom's culture plays into it. There was no disrespect, and if your friend understands anything about many Asian cultures, respecting your elders is paramount.", "NTA, I don't think it's appropriation, your stepmom shared a part of her culture with you. There's nothing wrong with it IMO.", "NTA.  On the whole, wearing clothing which is from a different culture may be cultural appropriation.  And if someone who was Japanese got upset, well, I would at least think about that.\n\nBut in this case, a Japanese person with whom you have a personal relationship loaned you a.particular item for you to wear specifically.   That isn't cultural appropriation - that is a sweet gesture from your stepmother to you.", "NTA.  Your mom grounded you for wearing a gorgeous dress to prom??  Why on earth were people not happy?  If you looked good and felt good about what you were wearing, you are good.", "You even bought the dress,  so your mom doesn\u2019t have the excuse that you wasted her money. NTA\n\nThe friend isn\u2019t worth bothering about. \n\nYou mentioned that your mom was feeling jealous.  Talk to her about it.  People often react on instinct, and get stubborn.  Reassure her that her that a step, no matter how kind isn\u2019t going to replace her. \n\nMaybe ask her if she wants to get dressed up , and take pictures of the two of you in your original dress.  An hour of hair and makeup is well worth the effort.", "I can tell you already, you\u2019re NTA. If your stepmother initiated it, then that would be on her. Your mom being upset is her own problem. Now if your stepmom is actually Japanese, compared to your friend who has Japanese heritage(there is a difference), and your mom encouraged it, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem there, either.", "Unless you agreed to match with your friend, NTA. No way. A gift and option from the person within the culture for YOUR prom was presented and you both wore and appreciated it.", "NTA. You wore a beautiful kimono that was given to you as a gift to wear by a Japanese woman. Hers is only opinion that matters here.\n\nAs for \"standing out\"...yeah? That's why people buy extravagant prom dresses, so they can stand out. That's the point.", "Your friend might be of Japanese heritage but she's showing that she's not culturally Japanese.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with non-Japanese people wearing kimonos.  Go to Japan and you'll be asked and given some by locals because they want to see you wear then. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA.

What harm is that going to cause?", "NTA", "The unofficial rule with cultural appropriation is if a person from that culture gives you permission then it\u2019s ok.

Your mom is jealous that you wore your step mom's dress.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's your prom. Nobody else's", "NTA but I can see how this could look like cultural appropriation out of context. Your step mom made a nice gesture by offering the dress that means a lot to her for you to wear and that\u2019s what really matters. It\u2019s all the acceptance you need here.", "Prob NTA here considering the facts given. Could be ESH since I don't understand the motivations for the dress being offered or you accepting it. Speaking for myself, I would probably role my eyes if I saw someone with no ties to Japan rocking a kimono at all, much less to prom lol. At the end of the day if you liked it then that's cool and really the most important thing. But not expecting any eye rolls (i.e. sour grapes) is kinda naive.", "NTA", "NTA has your mother seen some of the outfits people wear to prom nowadays? Titties out, guys freeballing in silk pants, open chests with no button downs, exposed legs. These are all acceptable in today's society, and as for your friend I think if she has a cultural issue she should address your stepmother, not you. I bet you where the star of the prom wearing that lovely kimono, and your stepmother probably felt really excited for you and happy that you two are close.", "NTA but your mom and step-mom both are.\n\nYour step-mom set you up for criticism about cultural appropriation.  She was trying to get closer to you by offering you the kimono.  She was OK with it, but she failed to consider the feelings of other Japanese people, such as your friend.  \n\nYour mom is making a big deal about it because your step-mom was involved, and it makes it clear that you are getting closer to her.  Mom jealousy pure and simple.\n\nYes, you should have known better than to wear a traditional costume from a culture you are not part of.  But you were given bad advice from a trusted adult, so you aren't the a hole.", "NTA", "Esh it's not cultural appreciation. A Japanese person lent you their kimono. Also, the majority of Japanese people, not Japnese America, don't give a shit if non Japanese people wear kimono.  I did a study abroad and the older ladies seemed to love dressing me up like their own life sized Barbie doll. \n\n~~However, your mom had already bought you a dress so I'd be annoyed at the wasted money.~~\n\nYour step mom also kinda sucks bc why would she wait until literally the day of to offer?\n\nEdit mom didn't buy the dress, so there was no wasted money", "Yta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In fact you can do formal photoshoots in places like Kyoto where people dress you up in kimono and take pictures for you as souvenirs, and also as a way of learning what it's like to style and wear a kimono (which is a very complicated garment).

You have a strong tie to Japan - your stepmother. The lack of willingness to acknowledge this strong tie is the problem.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.

The dress code is the black tie/formal dress. If it's a formal kimono, that is indeed a formal dress. I guess it was the colorful one with long sleeves? That's called furisode, and is indeed considered to be a very formal wear for a young lady. You can tell your mother that even Noble Prize committee considers kimonos to be formalwear. \n\nb) You do have ties to Japan. Your stepmother is Japanese.

There's nothing wrong with non-Japanese people being inspired by Japanese street style.\n\nThe problem is that she profited off of it. She made \"Harajuku\" into her own brand. She created all of this merch and perfume and crap under the name Harajuku with dubious Japanese \"kawaii\" influences, hired Japanese backup dancers and turned them into her silent entourage, hell she even called her entire tour Harajuku Lovers Tour. She turned it into her identity while profiting off of it.\n\nNow, this all MAY have been slightly less nauseating if at any point Stefani demonstrated some kind of actual fascination with Japanese culture beyond plaid poofy skirts from Harajuku, but, no not really. She doesn't speak Japanese, she was not formally educated on anything related to Japan or East Asian studies, she does not have Japanese family members (like OP), I doubt she has any experience living in Japan beyond being there on vacation or for touring. So the whole thing was really gross. Just reinforced stereotypes about Asian women being cute and silent while Gwen the white lady got to be the center of the stage and profited massively off of a foreign culture she clearly had nothing but superficial, tenuous connections to.\n\nAnyway hope you don't mind my rant hahaha.

Having feelings is fine.  Being conflicted is fine.  \n\nMaking statements that it's against the culture when it's widely accepted by that original culture is not fine.

That's no different than being upset that native foods that are readily shared got spread.   \n\nNow if someone wanted to be upset that something happened on a smaller subset of that culture, then that's reasonable.  For example it would be normal to be upset at changing a regional recipe to something and claiming its authentic.   The friend could speak towards OP wearing the kimono being less acceptable in her subculture she experiences.   \n\nBut non-Japanese people wearing kimonos is as acceptable in the root culture as eating peanut butter in Europe is.

THAT'S cultural appropriation. It's a real thing - the term is just WILDLY misunderstood.\n\nIt is not a term that applies to gifts from members of that culture, or applies when someone is financially supporting members of that culture. Your Japanese stepmother wanted to share something of her culture with you of her own free will.

It isn't.\n\nI have spoken to quite a few Japanese people, enough to know many Japanese people tend to like it when they are able to export their culture. There's a couple of Japanese cultural festivals where I live, and it seems that they are pretty open to sharing their culture. Those who I have spoken to see it as continuity, and growth. And they appreciate it when the beauty of the cultural items, such as kimonos, are appreciated and are worn. Because even if the person wearing it does not appreciate it, someone will. And it still will be out there for the world to see.\n\nAlso, the making of traditional Kimonos is dying out  (just one example: [https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/kimonos-a-dying-art/2007050834590](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/kimonos-a-dying-art/2007050834590)). In order for there to be supply , at least in this case, there has to be demand. Lovers of traditional Kimonos around the world buy and trade in such a way that the market for these kimonos remain alive.  I don't know if your friend with Japanese heritage actually knows that.  And as a person of mixed cultures and history, I don't know enough about, let's say Chilean people to say what the people in Chile wear traditionally or know how people in Chile would feel about someone outside their culture wearing their traditional clothes.\n\nIronically, I know more about Japanese culture than any of the cultures in my history.

The friend specifically said \"it doesn't follow dress code.\"\n\nYou don't know if they wanted to wear a Kimono or something similar and were specifically refused. They also suspect that if they wore a Kimono, they'd be mocked for it (and they'd probably be right). So I can see how someone would be annoyed that a white person can wear it and get nothing but praise that a Japanese-American wouldn't get away with.\n\nOP's stepmom may be from Japan, but if you're Japanese from Japan, you're not going to get mocked for wearing a Kimono (probably). People aren't going act like you can't speak English or make fun of your name. It's not the same experience.\n\nI'm mixed race actually but I look mostly white. I live in a country where there aren't many foreigners and very few non-white foreigners and I finally understand how people like OP's friend feel.\n\nI've had people ask me \"where are you from\" and not take \"America\" as an answer. They want to know where my parents and their parents are from. People periodically call me a foreigner and talk about me openly because they think I don't understand. I've seen people surreptitiously try to take photos of me in public. \n\nIt can be really annoying that it happens over and over. Each moment is not THAT big of a deal, but other people don't always see how many monents are stacked on top of each other. Sometimes when I finally get annoyed at the 100th time someone calls me a foreigner or points at me, people are like \"why are you upset? They are just happy to meet a foreigner because they think you're cool.\"\n\nSo again, I'm not saying OP was TA but OP should understand that her experience is not the same as her friend's experience which is not the same as her stepmom's experience. OP should ask her friend to share her experiences and listen - really listen. I'm sure that's all friend wants. Not \"get over it, snowflake.\"", "Candidly I feel like Asian and Latinos think the cultural appropriation is bull shit.  Every Latino I have ever met has been like you want to wear a sombrero or some other piece of our culture well imitation is the best form of flattery so you do you.  I get the same vibe with Asian culture as well.  They know they have a cool heritage and culture.", "I think this is specifically why friend was annoyed. If Japanese-American friend wears a Kimono, she knows and we all know she probably gets made fun of in a racial way to SOME extent. At minimum, people laugh. At worst, she'd get straigh up racial abuse. Both born-in-Japan stepmom and white OP haven't had that experience. \n\nOP isn't wrong, I think, but OP could stand to listen to her friend about why her friend isn't happy about it. Maybe OP would learn something interesting, or maybe not.", "My very not Asian daughter wore a kimono she found at the thrift store to church. All the Asian women complimented her on it, though not all are Japanese.  They seemed thrilled it was so authentic.\n\nI think it varies by person.", "I understood their comment to mean that your experience wearing a kimono in Japan is very different than an Asian-American person\u2019s \n experience wearing a kimono. You didn\u2019t have to worry about racism whereas Asian-American people may be hesitant to embrace their ancestral culture because it would put a target on their backs and draw negative attention from bigots.", "Oh please , Americans are no more sensitive about race than others. Many countries have violent racial issues and refusing to call that out or even acknowledge it under the guise of oh this is an American issue is absolutely insane.", "Absolutely. It is traditional in Japan that if a westerner does a home stay that they often give them a kimono as a gift.", "Are they Japanese American though? Or are they actually Japanese? I can\u2019t imagine the Japanese people I know reacting this way and even less can I imagine them calling the OP\u2019s mom directly to complain (very unJapanese behaviour), but the Japanese Americans sure would.\n\nI think this is a gate keeping issue rather than cultural appropriation.", "OP also stated her mum then had to explain to those parents that OP has a Japanese step mum who gave her the kimono, which was an issue she didn't want to talk about for personal reasons. Including the step mum being younger. So I'm sure once the offended parents understood the nuance, they wouldn't have been bothered.", "OPs mom should be telling them to mind their own business. \n\nIt's absolutely okay to wear cultural clothing when a member of that culture invites you to do it and shows you how to do it properly (her stepmom gave her a kimono so it wasn't done cheap knock off of a traditional garment, and presumably helped her dress in it properly). \n\nThe \"angry Asians\" are angry because they don't know about OPs stepmom, and they don't know that OP was invited to wear the garment by a close Japanese family member. \n\nAll mom should be saying is \"OPs stepmom is Japanese and wanted to share her clothing and her culture with OP, and no-one should be standing in the way of that\". Then they will know that it was done properly and with respect, and probably won't be angry anymore (and if they are they are being unreasonable). \n\nOPs mom isn't stepping up and doing that because she doesn't like the stepmom, which is a shitty reason to not support your daughter.", "They can all get over themselves.", "So they are bullying a child over a stupid fuckin dress? How pathetic.", "I think the mom is being overly dramatic about the calls and complaints.  If it was inappropriate, no one would want to mention it for fear of being rude.", "Chinese communities in Anglophone countries have been calling it Chinese New Year for a very, very long time. Not that it stops white people on Reddit from yelling at Singaporeans for being racist by excluding the Vietnamese, when the Singaporean Chinese guy was talking about his own celebrations (an actual series of posts I had the displeasure of seeing).", "My partner got me a traditional dress from their culture, and I'm afraid to ever wear it without them because I feel like people will assume I'm being *that\" person. Makes me sad because it's beautiful and makes me think of them when I wear it.", "Ok so, I don't really agree with most of the sentiments here. First of all, Asian Americans are likely to meet with racist comments like \"wow, your English is amazing!\" regardless of how they dress. That's kind of the issue. It doesn't really matter how \"American\" they present themselves as because the bottom line here is that narrow-minded Americans assume that people with Asian facial features are, by default, born and raised in Asia.\n\nSecond of all, the issue isn't whether a white person or a person of Asian descent wears a kimono in the U.S. The issue is stereotyping of kimono, period. A lot of Japanese clothing suffers from inaccurate stereotyping in the U.S. People don't understand that in Japan kimono are this very beautiful, traditional clothing that you wear on special occasions, whereas here it's been devolved into \"geisha\" and \"cosplay\" type imaging. This is not the case.\n\nWhen people are stereotyping you, you honestly cannot really win when you wear kimono in the U.S. Sure, if you're a person of Asian origin, then perhaps people will assume that you're \"fresh off the boat.\" But if you're NOT a person of Asian origin, then guess what? The assumption is usually going to be that you are a weird anime nerd, you're trying to be a Halloween geisha, or that you are guilty of cultural appropriation, which is the problem that we're dealing with. It didn't matter that OP had a Japanese stepmother, or that OP was actually wearing kimono on an appropriate occasion (a special milestone party). People went ahead and made assumptions that she was just goofing off in a costume in an act of cultural appropriation. In fact, I find it pretty interesting that the Japanese American friend who was upset by it didn't even know the background with the stepmother (from OP's comments). Why didn't they think to ask? The average American person does not generally own, or even know how to WEAR one (look up the number of steps to wear it and the required undergarments, it's insane; clearly OP had help from someone knowledgeable).\n\nI've worn kimono in both the U.S. and Japan. Obviously, in Japan people don't really notice it as anything odd (just something beautiful, if they notice at all), but in the U.S. it's much more likely I'll get a side eye or people looking confused (like, what the hell is that? type looks). The point I'm trying to get at here is, whether you are Asian American or white or Japanese, these stereotypes are completely counterproductive. Kimono are just beautiful and wearing them is an incredibly rare opportunity. OP is lucky to have a stepmother who offered that to her.", "Managerception", "If her mom is from Japan, the Japanese experience in Japan is not the same as being Japanese American. There's a good chance any Japanese-American wearing a Kimono to prom gets mocked and racially abused. That wouldn't happen in Japan so OP's stepmom may not understand either. Those parents are wrong, but again OP doesn't know their experiences.\n\nI remember one of my best friends in high school found out my biodad is black, and the very next time I see him he starts out making n-word and black jokes. You can call me a snowflake but you don't know what experiences other people have, so don't be so quick to say everyone is just too sensitive.", "I don't know, but I've heard that native Japanese and Japanese American may not see eye to eye on this issue.", "Well I don\u2019t think saying that will win them over at school.", "There's a video on YT of a white guy wearing traditional Chinese attire, in China.  He asks a bunch of other tourists, mostly caucasian, what they think of his outfit.  Lots of responses that its inappropriate or offensive. He also asks a bunch of the locals what they think of his outfit. Happy beaming responses about how lovely he looks. He then asks the locals if they think it's at all offensive for him to be wearing these clothes. The locals, mostly older people, say they like seeing people appreciate the clothing, that it's nice to share it & see visitors actually want to wear it. Cultural appreciation,  not appropriation.\n\nContext is important, & in a rush to express offence, people forget this. Wearing traditional attire as a fancy dress costume or at Halloween, is definitely more inappropriate. Intention is key. Btw, it sounds like your trip to Korea was really great & memorable. I'd love to go one day.", "Jeans weren't invented by the people who colonized India.  Stop conflating all European-descended cultures, yo.", "Is this to me\u2026? If it is, okay \ud83d\udc4d? You said that didn\u2019t understand the other comment so I tried to help by sharing how I feel it was meant to be interpreted. But since you typed that all out, to be quite blunt, I don\u2019t care about a non-Japanese person\u2019s opinion when it comes to appropriating or appreciating Japanese culture. I also don\u2019t really care if a non-Japanese person gets accused of cultural appropriation for wearing a kimono.", "I\u2019ve got a kimono my mum was gifted for me when she visited Japan 35 years ago. It\u2019s a bit worn out now but I still have it on display as it\u2019s so pretty. When I was younger I wore it around my house and often got told how beautiful it is.", "Yup, the experiences of diaspora vs people who just immigrated & grew up as the majority in their country of origin are very different. It's pretty common with these cultural appropriation debates that you have (for example) Japanese people saying something is fine and Japanese-American people saying it's not. When you grow up as the \"outsider\" and as the minority \"exotic\" culture, your relationship to that culture is going to be very different than for people for whom that culture is literally the societal norm.", "Or the parents are jealous bc their own kids won't wear traditional clothing and aren't interested in learning about their own culture, as a father once confided to me when I was running a ramen booth for my high school's anime club. He was so happy to see a white kid wearing a \"ganbare\" headband, even though I was a total weeb.", "Not to veer too far off topic but I hope you punched that motherfucker in the mouth for that.", "I think you hit the nail on the head in the second paragraph there. In the context of this thread OP was doing something suggested to her by somebody from that culture. It was done respectfully and people are getting offended for no Good reason.\n\nIf you want to go to Korea then definitely do it. I spent a month there and loved it despite not speaking korean, almost always there was somebody who spoke English nearby, even the time we got lost and ended up in the suburbs somewhere about 2 hours away from where we wanted to be. We found one of the best restaurants we went to on the whole trip because of that. We were like well we are hungry now that place looks busy so the locals must like it let's go.", ">I also don\u2019t really care if a non-Japanese person gets accused of cultural appropriation for wearing a kimono.\n\nDid you read OP's post at all \ud83e\udd23", "Exactly. I don't even think anyone did anything wrong, but acting like the Japanese-American friend just has no idea what is going on and must be misguided is completely ridiculous. I think that person knows more about the context and the experience than anyone here including OP and stepmom.\n\nIf OP's friend wears a kimono in school, people will act like she must really not love America and just wants attention and doesn't want to fit in. If she ignores her culture, she'll get called a sellout or people will say she just wants to be white. While she's trying to thread the needle of being Japanese and Americans, she sees her friend wear a kimono and everyone loves and praises it. It has to be annoying, even if no one was wrong.", "What if i don't need their permission?", "I was going by the tone of OP'S responses though, unless I misinterpreted them. She says her mom wasn't lashing out at OP, but was just stressed at receiving multiple calls. OP is defending her mom in the comments, so I don't want to attack her mom.", "Also, don't forget that OP \\*did\\* ask said friend about her opinion of it. I assume that friend held her tongue when OP initially wore the kimono, but gave her honest opinion and feelings about it when asked. I don't think we can really fault her for giving an opinion when specifically prompted on it, especially when said friend was not aware that OP was lent the kimono by another Japanese person.", "Also this subreddit has a bad habit of assuming the worst of people and then s******* on them for it.  Not to mention the interchangeable misogyny and misandry that permeates it.", "It's not about being allowed, you can wear whatever you want. Other people are free to judge you. It's up to you on if you care about their judgement.", "Ya, but why would her mom lay into her dad over the kimono? Why is the mom even angry about it in the first place?", "It's still an insanely weak comparison. Wearing a kimono in Japan... is not an every day occurance like eating peanut butter. Peanut butter is like 3 dollars for a jar, kimonos are significantly expensive and tourism is a pretty big industry in major metropolitan cities. Of course they would have a vested interest in getting foreigners to wear kimonos in Japan? \n\nI kind of get the impression that your take is essentially that Japanese Americans aren't really Japanese though? If that's not your intention, my bad, but that is definitely what it feels like. \nBut, no offense, it's quite cocky to assume just because someone is Japanese American they wouldn't know anything about the \"root culture\" (assuming there is one unified culture and opinion in a country with over 100 million people). Just because they don't live in Japan doesn't mean they regularly visit/talk with relatives in Japan.", "I don't know, but I saw it as a normal response to being put on the spot and on the defensive from multiple calls. It can't be pleasant having to defend daughter's actions repeatedly, not to mention million questions about the marital status. I highly doubt people would've stopped after finding out OP has a Japanese stepmother. I can absolutely imagine nosy people digging deeper. Must've been a deeply uncomfortable situation having to discuss something that personal with random strangers."]}
