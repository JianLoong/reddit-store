I invited a good amount of people, but my mom needed a list of approximately how many people are coming for how much food she\u2019s gonna cook and how many drinks my dad needs to get. Plus, my house is not big at all.\n\nSo, I invited 5 of my aunts and 7 of my friends. However, I texted 1 of the 7 friends saying \u201cHey! I\u2019m having my 21st birthday party on Saturday and I\u2019d really enjoy it if you came!\u201d So she texts me back \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be there!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just thinking\u2026who\u2019s \u201cwe?\u201d\n\nI then asked her what she meant by that and if she was referring to her and her husband, she says yes. I had to break it to her that there\u2019s only a certain amount of people allowed to come over because I already have a list planned out. Plus, there\u2019s not gonna be any guys at the party except my dad, and I\u2019m sure my friends husband would feel out of place. I have absolutely nothing against the guy, he\u2019s chill and has always been nice to me\u2026but like I said, there\u2019s only so many people that can come. I asked my friend to please not be mad.\n\nMy friend texted me back, giving me a bit of an attitude. She said \u201cI\u2019m not mad, I\u2019m just upset. Because when you gave me the invitation, I automatically assumed you meant me and [husband] could come.\u201d So I had to break it down to her and say \u201cDude, I\u2019m not trying to be a jerk, but if I wanted to invite you and your husband, I would\u2019ve said that I wanted \u2018you AND him\u2019 or \u2018both of y\u2019all\u2019 in the invite. But I said \u2018you\u2019. It\u2019s not that I have anything against him, it\u2019s just that I invited you ONLY and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nI sent her that text, and she hasn\u2019t answered. AITA in this situation? I mean, not to be that person, but my God, it\u2019s my party, my list and everything. What the heck do I do?! Thanks to everyone\u2019s answers in advance.\n\nEDIT: Hey y\u2019all, so I\u2019ve gotten a good 50% of people saying I\u2019m NTA, and another good 50% of people saying I am TA. Either way, the people on the second 50% made some good points and I tried to follow the advice they gave. So, I texted my friend, saying: \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make myself clear enough. And I\u2019m really sorry if I came off as rude/disrespectful. I\u2019ve come to realize that now these days that when a couple is married, \u201cyou\u201d is plural for both people, which I didn\u2019t know at first. You no longer have to come if you don\u2019t want to, but regardless I just wanted to own up and apologize. Have a good night.\u201d I hope this helps settle everything.

You sent an open invite to a married woman. There's a presumption that the invite is for she AND her husband.\n\nTaking back the invite as you did and inviting just her likely put her off.

I don't get this need for (mostly monogamous) couples to be extremely codependent and have to go to events together.", "NTA\nQuick questions for clarification,\n\nHow have invites to events/outings been phrased previously? Do they normally attend all events as a couple or is it normal for the two of you to hang out without the husband? \n\nI assume they are not always around or you might also consider them a friend too. I think it is totally reasonable to exclude partners of friends if they are not also your friends. If that husband was the only partner being excluded you might be the bad guy but that doesn\u2019t sound like the situation. \nThe second text was a little harsh but often times that can be due to lack of tone. I\u2019m sure if you were face to face it might have gone over a little better. \nAlso, why would the husband want to attend if you aren\u2019t friend friends and none of their friends are attending besides their partner?", "NTA. Tbh 21 is young and if your friend is in the same age range I think this sorta thing wouldn't be common, or even expected. And I think some here are forgetting that. Also you were being genuinely considerate knowing other than your Dad he'd be the only guy there and not likely not fun for him and would change the dynamic of a 'girls night', which is considerate of your other guests.\n\nI've known my best friend since I was 7 but her homophobic ass partner is not welcome at events around my gay & lesbian friends because he's got small pecker syndrome and seems grossed out by gays and bizarrely emasculated by lesbians so idgaf anymore. Their comfort is prioritised over his inclusion.\n\nHe can stay home and look after the lovely kids he had with her out of wedlock. (Still hasn't put a ring on it). Such an upstanding religious man, very outspoken on his patriarchal 'Christian' values. Thought no sex before marriage was one of those but I digress. Gay is the only real sin apparently/s\n\nI don't necessarily like how married people always expect to be included as one no matter what. You can do things separately. Less applicable to the ones at 40 years old, having had kids and married for many years type thing where it's average for that demographic. Especially in the country/rural areas and everyone knows everyone. But more *specifically* at such a young age when the family/close female friend only mix IS a common birthday set up, as one is still breaking out from the residual teen/young adult stuff to fully fledged mature adult and you don't really have a relationship with this person outside of your friendship and it's a very close, small event for you. Enjoy.", "NTA", "NTA. You invited her, not her husband. It would be more appropriate for her to ask, \"Hey, would it be okay if my husband came as well?\" But an invite is not automatically extended to S/Os.", "NTA. Why would she assume? It\u2019s like she never heard \u201cwhen you assume you make an ass of u and me\u201d.", "YTA. Married couples are usually a package deal unless clearly stated otherwise. Your message didn't say anything about it being a girls thing or that nobody else was bringing their bf/partner.

No one respects our boundaries when they step on OUR PROPERTY! My (now ex) wife was using her cellphone in my company, so I calmly threw it away! After we divorced, I now make sure my friends (some may call them my \u201cemployees,\u201d but most who did that subsequently committed fireable offences) do not bring their spouses into my home for our parties in order to maintain the atmosphere of \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d I aspire to maintain.", "YTA mostly for failing to realize that in English \"you\" is both singular and plural.", "YTA Your response was rude. That's not how you should have handle that confrontation. When inviting someone that's married the assumption is that both of them are invited unless specifically stated otherwise.

It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to lose our friendship, but if she\u2019s able to be blunt and automatically assume her husband is allowed to come, surely I can be bold right back.

Unless she's from a culture where people regularly get married at 18-19, then this situation has probably never come up before. The fact that married couples are often \"units\" when sending invites is not etiquette she was likely aware of. I feel this situation is either NAH or ESH because of the lack of clear communication.

BUT alsoo, when your friend said that their husband was coming, you might as well had said something like \u201cOfc! He can come as well!\u201d- it\u2019s polite. You don\u2019t have to however, as that\u2019s just out of politeness.                                                            \nFrom your comments, it seems that you want to understand this better next time, so I suggest try that next time you want something like this, be like \u201cYou are invited for a fun girls\u2019 hangout for my 21st birthday party!\u201d This shows that you don\u2019t want the husband to come, but it\u2019s also fun and polite.     \nEdit: but considering the fact that you\u2019re just 21, it\u2019s not that bad. Some of the comments said that you can\u2019t be expected to know about the inviting as a pair thing, but I think you should have, but that doesn\u2019t even matter really. But the thing is, when I imagine husband and wives going to parties together, they\u2019re like dinner parties and stuff, if you guys are that young, the husband and wife going together thing doesn\u2019t apply as much in my eyes. This is a birthday party after all, and I guess they just still expected to go together.", "Why didn\u2019t you reach out to her saying you were having a girls thing for your birthday? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re an asshole for not inviting him, but once people are married it\u2019s common courtesy to invite both to a party unless you specify ahead of time you\u2019re \u201cjust having some girls over, it\u2019s going to be a small party\u201d. You could have also responded by saying, \u201caww I\u2019d love to do something together with both of you another time, but I was just thinking it could be girl time for my birthday and have a small group over. Hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d I doubt she would have gotten very upset.", "Yta", "NTA. I agree that married/long term commitment couples are a unit. However, it's a birthday party, and of a 21 year old. On top of that, if you're not friends with spouse or close, why would you want their spouse on your closed birthday party? And lastly, personally, as a married person, I believe people should ask and clarify if they can bring their spouses along because what if the host can't/don't want to host them?", "I see a lot of people saying that you're the a** but I would have done something similar and would have only meant that person when texting that person. My friends and I are in our 30s and an invite to one of them is not an invite to their SOs. They ask if they can bring them, or we specifically and explicitly invite both the friend and their SO.

You explained that you invited her and not her husband, and that's what you meant.

From what you originally said, it doesn't seem like she would know that and was probably assuming it was a big open party where significant others were welcome. \n\nSo when you realized the confusion you should have just explained what you explained here about limited space and no men will be there.

My wife's friends and I are not specifically friends even if we are cordial. If they invite my wife to something, it's not assumed that I'm invited as well, unless it's specifically mentioned. Same goes for my friends and my wife, though more of my friends are married couples and tend to extend invitations to include my wife, though that's been more of a \"more's the merrier\" vibe since our get togethers tend to be \"booze and Cards Against Humanity\" types of affairs. But when a buddy invites me over to watch a wrestling event, my wife is not assumed to be invited, even if my friend's wife and any other non-interested friends will be there while my buddy & I watch the show.
