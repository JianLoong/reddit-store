I invited a good amount of people, but my mom needed a list of approximately how many people are coming for how much food she\u2019s gonna cook and how many drinks my dad needs to get. Plus, my house is not big at all.\n\nSo, I invited 5 of my aunts and 7 of my friends. However, I texted 1 of the 7 friends saying \u201cHey! I\u2019m having my 21st birthday party on Saturday and I\u2019d really enjoy it if you came!\u201d So she texts me back \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be there!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just thinking\u2026who\u2019s \u201cwe?\u201d\n\nI then asked her what she meant by that and if she was referring to her and her husband, she says yes. I had to break it to her that there\u2019s only a certain amount of people allowed to come over because I already have a list planned out. Plus, there\u2019s not gonna be any guys at the party except my dad, and I\u2019m sure my friends husband would feel out of place. I have absolutely nothing against the guy, he\u2019s chill and has always been nice to me\u2026but like I said, there\u2019s only so many people that can come. I asked my friend to please not be mad.\n\nMy friend texted me back, giving me a bit of an attitude. She said \u201cI\u2019m not mad, I\u2019m just upset. Because when you gave me the invitation, I automatically assumed you meant me and [husband] could come.\u201d So I had to break it down to her and say \u201cDude, I\u2019m not trying to be a jerk, but if I wanted to invite you and your husband, I would\u2019ve said that I wanted \u2018you AND him\u2019 or \u2018both of y\u2019all\u2019 in the invite. But I said \u2018you\u2019. It\u2019s not that I have anything against him, it\u2019s just that I invited you ONLY and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nI sent her that text, and she hasn\u2019t answered. AITA in this situation? I mean, not to be that person, but my God, it\u2019s my party, my list and everything. What the heck do I do?! Thanks to everyone\u2019s answers in advance.\n\nEDIT: Hey y\u2019all, so I\u2019ve gotten a good 50% of people saying I\u2019m NTA, and another good 50% of people saying I am TA. Either way, the people on the second 50% made some good points and I tried to follow the advice they gave. So, I texted my friend, saying: \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make myself clear enough. And I\u2019m really sorry if I came off as rude/disrespectful. I\u2019ve come to realize that now these days that when a couple is married, \u201cyou\u201d is plural for both people, which I didn\u2019t know at first. You no longer have to come if you don\u2019t want to, but regardless I just wanted to own up and apologize. Have a good night.\u201d I hope this helps settle everything.

You sent an open invite to a married woman. There's a presumption that the invite is for she AND her husband.\n\nTaking back the invite as you did and inviting just her likely put her off.

Since it\u2019s women only, it would have been best to say \u201chey! I\u2019m having a girls night for my 21st birthday! I\u2019d love it if you came.

I don't get this need for (mostly monogamous) couples to be extremely codependent and have to go to events together.", "NTA\nQuick questions for clarification,\n\nHow have invites to events/outings been phrased previously? Do they normally attend all events as a couple or is it normal for the two of you to hang out without the husband? \n\nI assume they are not always around or you might also consider them a friend too. I think it is totally reasonable to exclude partners of friends if they are not also your friends. If that husband was the only partner being excluded you might be the bad guy but that doesn\u2019t sound like the situation. \nThe second text was a little harsh but often times that can be due to lack of tone. I\u2019m sure if you were face to face it might have gone over a little better. \nAlso, why would the husband want to attend if you aren\u2019t friend friends and none of their friends are attending besides their partner?", "NTA. Tbh 21 is young and if your friend is in the same age range I think this sorta thing wouldn't be common, or even expected. And I think some here are forgetting that. Also you were being genuinely considerate knowing other than your Dad he'd be the only guy there and not likely not fun for him and would change the dynamic of a 'girls night', which is considerate of your other guests.\n\nI've known my best friend since I was 7 but her homophobic ass partner is not welcome at events around my gay & lesbian friends because he's got small pecker syndrome and seems grossed out by gays and bizarrely emasculated by lesbians so idgaf anymore. Their comfort is prioritised over his inclusion.\n\nHe can stay home and look after the lovely kids he had with her out of wedlock. (Still hasn't put a ring on it). Such an upstanding religious man, very outspoken on his patriarchal 'Christian' values. Thought no sex before marriage was one of those but I digress. Gay is the only real sin apparently/s\n\nI don't necessarily like how married people always expect to be included as one no matter what. You can do things separately. Less applicable to the ones at 40 years old, having had kids and married for many years type thing where it's average for that demographic. Especially in the country/rural areas and everyone knows everyone. But more *specifically* at such a young age when the family/close female friend only mix IS a common birthday set up, as one is still breaking out from the residual teen/young adult stuff to fully fledged mature adult and you don't really have a relationship with this person outside of your friendship and it's a very close, small event for you. Enjoy.", "NTA", "NTA. You invited her, not her husband. It would be more appropriate for her to ask, \"Hey, would it be okay if my husband came as well?\" But an invite is not automatically extended to S/Os.", "NTA. Why would she assume? It\u2019s like she never heard \u201cwhen you assume you make an ass of u and me\u201d.", "YTA. Married couples are usually a package deal unless clearly stated otherwise. Your message didn't say anything about it being a girls thing or that nobody else was bringing their bf/partner.

No one respects our boundaries when they step on OUR PROPERTY! My (now ex) wife was using her cellphone in my company, so I calmly threw it away! After we divorced, I now make sure my friends (some may call them my \u201cemployees,\u201d but most who did that subsequently committed fireable offences) do not bring their spouses into my home for our parties in order to maintain the atmosphere of \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d I aspire to maintain.", "YTA mostly for failing to realize that in English \"you\" is both singular and plural.", "YTA Your response was rude. That's not how you should have handle that confrontation. When inviting someone that's married the assumption is that both of them are invited unless specifically stated otherwise. Thats just a social norm..... it was your mistake for not being clear.

She\u2019s gonna be 23 soon, and I\u2019ll be 21 tomorrow.

It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to lose our friendship, but if she\u2019s able to be blunt and automatically assume her husband is allowed to come, surely I can be bold right back. I don\u2019t have anything against her husband, but I wished she had understood when I said \u201cI\u2019d really enjoy it if *you* came.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m in the wrong, who knows, but I guess this goes to show that we both assumed two completely different things.", "You know what?

An invitation to a couple has pretty much always included both people in the relationship.\n\nYTA. Still.", "I feel like a lot of comments are glossing over the fact that OP is literally just turning 21. Unless she's from a culture where people regularly get married at 18-19, then this situation has probably never come up before. The fact that married couples are often \"units\" when sending invites is not etiquette she was likely aware of. I feel this situation is either NAH or ESH because of the lack of clear communication. Sounds like OP has learned from this and will know for future events, hopefully her friend will accept the apology and be understanding of the mistake, especially if they're the only married couple in the friend group.\n\nSide note, everyone saying they'd never go to a party their spouse wasn't invited to is a little cringey.

So I guess NAH?", "I'm just echoing people in here already, and by your edit you already get it. Nobody's really an asshole here, she assumed, and you couldve phrased things differently. I'm married and if that text was sent to me honestly  yeah I probably would've at first assumed both of us were invited to your 21st bday. Big event and can be gender neutral.

But if I got invited to a party, I\u2019d assume my husband would also be invited. However, if I *then* found out it was a ladies night, we\u2019d both chuckle and I\u2019d still go. If my husband got invited to a guys only thing, I wouldn\u2019t *want* to go, much less get upset I wasn\u2019t invited.", "Especially if we had booked a babysitter or similar", "It's not unhealthy to do everything with your spouse either. My husband and I have been married for almost 20 years and we do things without each other but it's rare. We are each others best friends. I don't want to do things without him but will when necessary. \n\nIn this instance, the way the invitation was presented and the response, I also wouldn't want to go without my spouse. That doesn't mean I would have minded had it been presented as girls only from the start. But it was more along the lines of \"I have limited room and your spouse doesn't make the cut.\"\n\nMost married couples would find that rude and not want to go.", "OP did not make it clear that it was a girls only party.\n\nOnly an uncivilized person would word an invitation to a married or long term couple like that.", "If she had specified its a party with girl friends and Aunts  that would have made it more clear.  A birthday party typically is not gender specific .      \nEdit.  Typo.  A birthday party isn\u2019t gender specific", "I think you're going about it the wrong way. Instead of saying \"only a certain amount of people are allowed to come due to certain situations\" your invitation should have said something like \"It's my Birthday and I'm having a Girls' Night Party!\" which would make it clear that it's women-only, not an \"I'm picking and choosing who gets to come and excluding partners\" thing.\n\nIf anyone shows up and makes a comment about your Dad being there and not being a woman, you can just say, \"Of course he's here, he lives in this house, and he's my dad.\"", "You\u2019re young but this is 100% true. I\u2019m not going to a party without my wife. I signed up for it.", "Then she\u2019s a bit of a butt for acting like the husband not joining was an issue when he normally doesn\u2019t.", "Do you mean single sex?", "Hey, you\u2019re right. I messaged her and apologized. I wrote down everything in the edit/update.", "If you would have started the invite with girl friends and aunts. This would have been more clear.", "Sorry, yes I do.  Thx for pointing out"]}
