I invited a good amount of people, but my mom needed a list of approximately how many people are coming for how much food she\u2019s gonna cook and how many drinks my dad needs to get. Plus, my house is not big at all.\n\nSo, I invited 5 of my aunts and 7 of my friends. However, I texted 1 of the 7 friends saying \u201cHey! I\u2019m having my 21st birthday party on Saturday and I\u2019d really enjoy it if you came!\u201d So she texts me back \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be there!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just thinking\u2026who\u2019s \u201cwe?\u201d\n\nI then asked her what she meant by that and if she was referring to her and her husband, she says yes. I had to break it to her that there\u2019s only a certain amount of people allowed to come over because I already have a list planned out. Plus, there\u2019s not gonna be any guys at the party except my dad, and I\u2019m sure my friends husband would feel out of place. I have absolutely nothing against the guy, he\u2019s chill and has always been nice to me\u2026but like I said, there\u2019s only so many people that can come. I asked my friend to please not be mad.\n\nMy friend texted me back, giving me a bit of an attitude. She said \u201cI\u2019m not mad, I\u2019m just upset. Because when you gave me the invitation, I automatically assumed you meant me and [husband] could come.\u201d So I had to break it down to her and say \u201cDude, I\u2019m not trying to be a jerk, but if I wanted to invite you and your husband, I would\u2019ve said that I wanted \u2018you AND him\u2019 or \u2018both of y\u2019all\u2019 in the invite. But I said \u2018you\u2019. It\u2019s not that I have anything against him, it\u2019s just that I invited you ONLY and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nI sent her that text, and she hasn\u2019t answered. AITA in this situation? I mean, not to be that person, but my God, it\u2019s my party, my list and everything. What the heck do I do?! Thanks to everyone\u2019s answers in advance.\n\nEDIT: Hey y\u2019all, so I\u2019ve gotten a good 50% of people saying I\u2019m NTA, and another good 50% of people saying I am TA. Either way, the people on the second 50% made some good points and I tried to follow the advice they gave. So, I texted my friend, saying: \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make myself clear enough. And I\u2019m really sorry if I came off as rude/disrespectful. I\u2019ve come to realize that now these days that when a couple is married, \u201cyou\u201d is plural for both people, which I didn\u2019t know at first. You no longer have to come if you don\u2019t want to, but regardless I just wanted to own up and apologize. Have a good night.\u201d I hope this helps settle everything.

I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the Ahold either to be honest. I am just wondering if there\u2019s an age gap between you and your friend. You did ask so I\u2019m just going to say she sounds more mature than yourself. Would it really be so bad if her husband was there maybe a bit of male company for dad if everyone else is female. Dads don\u2019t usually get involved in these things but he\u2019s paying and mum is doing the catering.

Instead you were kinda being mean and condescending when she simply expressed her feelings and the mistaken assumption she previously made.", "NAH.\n\nFriend admits her own assumption is why she's upset, she's entitled to feel like that.\n\nHowever, for future, I suggest throwing the invite out as a \"girls night\" or \"ladies and they-dies only\" (holla to the NB homies) if you don't want your married friend to assume your use of \"you\" which can be either singular or plural.", "YTA,\n\nMostly because of the second text you sent.

If you invited me and not my spouse, I wouldn\u2019t come. Not everyone feels that way. But it\u2019s better to be safe.", "NTA. You explained you were only allowed a certain amount of people and you were only hoping to have the ladies.  She assumed wrong.", "NAH.  It is usually assumed that married couples are both invited, you have to make a special contact if not.  If you invited me and not my wife, I would not come to your event.  I would not be upset about it, I just would not come.", "NAH to slight Y T A - This is mostly miscommunication, but I don't think most would assume there were hard limits on the number of guests when presented as just a \"21st birthday party\". Parties for adults are generally pretty much an open house sort of thing (at least in my area) unless otherwise specified.

You sent an open invite to a married woman. There's a presumption that the invite is for she AND her husband.\n\nTaking back the invite as you did and inviting just her likely put her off. She'll likely just decline at this point.", "INFO\n\nDid you previously know she was married?", "NAH,\n\nBut what you need to understand is \"You\" can be plural and a married couple is likely to assume that's what you meant.", "YTA. I was all NTA until I hit your second text saying your weren't trying to be a jerk while being a total jerk.

She had no way of knowing it would be a girls only deal unless to told her.", "NTA\n\nThough your last text was a bit rude. She shouldn't be assuming things you didn't explicitly say, especially with things like parties when it very much so matters if you have a +1 so you have enough food.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t have assumed it was an invite for them both. Sounds like you were clear in your original text when you invited just her, and even more clear when you explained your reasoning for it. It doesn\u2019t make much sense for her to be upset about it.", " NTA.", "NTA. Next time you should maybe make an effort to stress who exactly is invited, b/c married couples do tend to assume that if ones invited the other is as well (packaged deal kinda thing). But like you said, its your party, your rules and you're totally fine to just invite your friend w/out her husband.", " NTA. But it would have benefited to tweak your communication skills a bit. Since it\u2019s women only, it would have been best to say \u201chey! I\u2019m having a girls night for my 21st birthday! I\u2019d love it if you came. Don\u2019t worry about bringing anything since my moms preparing the food and my dad is buying the drinks. Let me know if you can make it!\u201d\nBy specifying that it\u2019s a girls night, she may understood her husband isn\u2019t welcome.", "NTA. I don't get this need for (mostly monogamous) couples to be extremely codependent and have to go to events together.", "NTA\nQuick questions for clarification,\n\nHow have invites to events/outings been phrased previously? Do they normally attend all events as a couple or is it normal for the two of you to hang out without the husband? \n\nI assume they are not always around or you might also consider them a friend too. I think it is totally reasonable to exclude partners of friends if they are not also your friends. If that husband was the only partner being excluded you might be the bad guy but that doesn\u2019t sound like the situation. \nThe second text was a little harsh but often times that can be due to lack of tone. I\u2019m sure if you were face to face it might have gone over a little better. \nAlso, why would the husband want to attend if you aren\u2019t friend friends and none of their friends are attending besides their partner?", "NTA. Tbh 21 is young and if your friend is in the same age range I think this sorta thing wouldn't be common, or even expected. And I think some here are forgetting that. Also you were being genuinely considerate knowing other than your Dad he'd be the only guy there and not likely not fun for him and would change the dynamic of a 'girls night', which is considerate of your other guests.\n\nI've known my best friend since I was 7 but her homophobic ass partner is not welcome at events around my gay & lesbian friends because he's got small pecker syndrome and seems grossed out by gays and bizarrely emasculated by lesbians so idgaf anymore. Their comfort is prioritised over his inclusion.\n\nHe can stay home and look after the lovely kids he had with her out of wedlock. (Still hasn't put a ring on it). Such an upstanding religious man, very outspoken on his patriarchal 'Christian' values. Thought no sex before marriage was one of those but I digress. Gay is the only real sin apparently/s\n\nI don't necessarily like how married people always expect to be included as one no matter what. You can do things separately. Less applicable to the ones at 40 years old, having had kids and married for many years type thing where it's average for that demographic. Especially in the country/rural areas and everyone knows everyone. But more *specifically* at such a young age when the family/close female friend only mix IS a common birthday set up, as one is still breaking out from the residual teen/young adult stuff to fully fledged mature adult and you don't really have a relationship with this person outside of your friendship and it's a very close, small event for you. Enjoy.", "NTA", "NTA. You invited her, not her husband. It would be more appropriate for her to ask, \"Hey, would it be okay if my husband came as well?\" But an invite is not automatically extended to S/Os.", "NTA. Why would she assume? It\u2019s like she never heard \u201cwhen you assume you make an ass of u and me\u201d.", "YTA. Married couples are usually a package deal unless clearly stated otherwise. Your message didn't say anything about it being a girls thing or that nobody else was bringing their bf/partner. English is dumb in that \"you\" can be singular or plural and you didn't give any indication that you meant singular.\n\nApologize for giving her attitude and be more clear in your words next time.", "NTA. No one respects our boundaries when they step on OUR PROPERTY! My (now ex) wife was using her cellphone in my company, so I calmly threw it away! After we divorced, I now make sure my friends (some may call them my \u201cemployees,\u201d but most who did that subsequently committed fireable offences) do not bring their spouses into my home for our parties in order to maintain the atmosphere of \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d I aspire to maintain.", "YTA mostly for failing to realize that in English \"you\" is both singular and plural.", "YTA Your response was rude. That's not how you should have handle that confrontation. When inviting someone that's married the assumption is that both of them are invited unless specifically stated otherwise. Thats just a social norm..... it was your mistake for not being clear. When sending invites that's why they say \"No plus 1\" or include a tactful sentences like 'space is limited therefore no additional parties please' or something like that.", "Yeah, you\u2019re kinda right ngl. She\u2019s gonna be 23 soon, and I\u2019ll be 21 tomorrow. I get what you\u2019re trying to say, but then again, like I said, only a certain amount of people are allowed to come due to certain situations. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to lose our friendship, but if she\u2019s able to be blunt and automatically assume her husband is allowed to come, surely I can be bold right back. I don\u2019t have anything against her husband, but I wished she had understood when I said \u201cI\u2019d really enjoy it if *you* came.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m in the wrong, who knows, but I guess this goes to show that we both assumed two completely different things.", "You know what?

And yeah, I believe I could\u2019ve been a little nicer. Thank you.", "I was thinking the same. To me sounds like OP came off as a smart ass in that message.  I probably wouldn't respond either.  \n\nI am leaning more NAH though but that message seemed kinda insulting.", "> It\u2019s blatantly a girls thing\n\nOP didn't necessarily make that clear in her initial invite though.....tbh I've never been to a \"girls only\" 21st birthday party. Unless otherwise stated, I'm gonna assume an adult's birthday party is gender-neutral.", "Wow, projection much? Where in that one sentence text message did it \"blatantly\" say it's a girls thing?", "Yes. She\u2019s been married for two years now.
