They had dated for about three months when my mother found out she was pregnant, so it wasn't much of a surprise to mostly anyone when he wasn't ready to be a father, but he went far beyond that. He left my mother and went NC with her and his family, who loved her, and never even paid a little child support to her. Despite my grandparents' help, we still grew up poor as hell, so I ended up getting a job at a locally-owned fast food place when I was 14 to help with the bills, even though it barely paid anything.\n\nWhile working there, I met a lot of the people who worked in the kitchen and was one of the few people who talked to them a lot even outside of work, since we lived in a small town and I was one of the, like, two other employees who spoke Spanish. I eventually met this guy who worked there named Luis (31m). He was the sort of 'laid back older guy' type, who messed with me a lot but also taught me a lot that I never learned because of my father. I invited him to my quincea\u00f1era and he danced with me for the father-daughter dance, he was the person I first called when I got my first flat tire since I had no idea how to fix one, I taught him a lot of the English he knows, and we generally grew really close over the years I knew him. He was sort of like an older brother/father figure to me, and since he also had a daughter, even though she was really young, like 5-ish, he treated me like his own kid. \n\nLuis and I have a thing where I call him 'pap\u00e1' or 'viejo' while he calls me 'la ni\u00f1a' or 'mi hija/mija', mostly as an inside joke thing, so it wasn't that weird to do it between us sometimes.\n\nAt my 17th birthday party last week (my mother is huge on celebrations and birthdays), my father somehow magically showed up after seventeen years of absence and started playing daddy with me. At this point, my mom had gotten a way better job through one of her friends, so I think he probably was just coming back hoping she would let him back in our lives so he could get something from her. (Probably money for drugs, which he claimed to have quit, but I'm pretty sure he never did.) I was mad at him for leaving me for so long, like I should be, and Luis was at the party, so I made it a point to call him 'pap\u00e1' more often than usual during the party, while I mostly just ignored my father, just to rub it in his face. I was angry at him and talked about Luis like he was my dad, but yesterday, my grandmother (father's mom) called and told me that he had come to stay with her and told her everything I did, and that it hurt him a lot, and that he only wanted a chance to make it up to me. Now I feel guilty for pushing him away and being petty when he wanted to reconnect with me.
