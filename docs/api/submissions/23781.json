So I went to my favourite restaurant restaurant to treat myself to my favourite meal. \n\nIt was all great at first. I had my laptop and got some work done as I waited for my food. I had just started eating when a family of four with kids around the age of 4 and 2 sat at the table beside mine. I was surprised because It's not an environment known to be hospitable to kids overall. \n\nInitially, the kids were quiet. It got progressively worse as they sat there. The little one was crying, the older one was shouting. And they went on and on. My sound cancelling earbuds didn't help me much. So I asked to move to a different table.\n\nThe restaurant isn't very big so I could still hear them crying and shouting. I barely enjoyed my food and was really angry because I very rarely get to have time for myself and I really wanted to enjoy this. \n\nAs I was paying, I told the father that I hoped they enjoyed their meal, because I barely could. He got mad and said I had no right to say anything about them, and went on to say he had barely had the time to eat out as a family and that I was being rude for no reason.\n\nI said sacrificing social events is part of parenting and that their kids were particularly loud.

It's becoming increasingly common for parents to not only bring their children to not-child-friendly locations but also to let them act ridiculous while there.  And they won't care that *your* day or experience was ruined.", "INFO: How do you say that the restaurant is not an environment known to be hospitable to kids overall?", "NTA - but going out in public always means we may have to interact with the more annoying people of that public.  We are all part of a society and unfortunately society also contains a lot of inconsiderate and annoying people.  I wouldn't blame the kids in this situation, but rather the parents. Kids are small, loud and their brains and social behaviors are not fully developed.  If I'm out in public with my kids and they are being annoying, I tell them to stop...and if they don't, I'll remove them from the place.  Not all people are like that though.  Just yesterday we were having a bite to eat and the people at the table next to us started chatting with us.  One of their kids was the rudest, least pleasant little shit I have ever met.  Like this 6-7 year old kids was a straight up asshole.  If one of my kids spoke to strangers (us) and other kids (mine) the way this kid did, I would  be appalled and there would be consequences.  These people didn't give a fuck. Some people just don't care about how they impact others around them.", "NTA, you could\u2019ve been more polite, and that\u2019s the route I would\u2019ve taken personally, but there is a limit. While it\u2019s reasonable in a clearly family friendly restaurant to hear children, even that has an expectation of some respectful noise level. The wait staff really should\u2019ve been the ones to politely ask them to rein the situation in so other guests could enjoy their meals, but they failed to do that and frustration is not an uncommon outcome. Next time I would try saying something to the staff first, and more politely to the family if that didn\u2019t resolve it. It won\u2019t work but it\u2019s worth a try.\n\nEdit: So everyone knows, but \u201cchildfree\u201d spaces legally don\u2019t and can\u2019t exist. This is very frustrating because parents will say \u201cif you don\u2019t like it, you need to go somewhere where kids aren\u2019t allowed.\u201d The only places that can legally bar children from coming in are places that include things like smoking and nudity. It\u2019s even more difficult if food is served. This is why kids are in casinos, even with smoking. People without children (and parents looking for a night off) don\u2019t necessarily want to be in bars and strip clubs every time they go out. When people have attempted to lobby for childfree spaces, parents have shut it down with protesting and cries of discrimination. So one of two things has to happen: either allow childfree spaces legally, or don\u2019t bring children to spaces clearly geared toward adults as a matter of courtesy. Yes, \u201cthey have as much right to be there as everyone else\u201d because it has been made deliberately impossible for people to have a space where kids aren\u2019t. \n\nSo you\u2019re literally saying \u201cget your own space!\u201d Then we try and you say \u201cyou\u2019re discriminating! You can\u2019t have your own space!\u201d This is why it\u2019s hard to have sympathy when I read an article about how adults are ruining Disneyland or whatever for kids, or about how someone got frustrated with your kids in a fancy restaurant. You\u2019re the one excluding us (and by us, I mean any adult that wants to spend an evening in the company of other adults, including parents) from public life, not the other way around. Bottom line: \u201callows children\u201d is not the same as \u201cfor children.\u201d\n\nEdit: to be clear, this varies by state. While age and familial status are not federally protected, many states choose to add them, the discrimination that is alleged when businesses attempt to age restrict their patrons is that parents of children are excluded or placed under undue burden, so they would be protected against discrimination based on having children, and the children themselves can be protected by age. This means that businesses open themselves up to costly lawsuits that many cannot afford by attempting to be adults only. I should\u2019ve clarified. Apologies.", "NTA ignore all the shitty parents in the comments", "YTA unless it was a bar or a particularly fancy restaurant. The kids were not running around creating chaos, they were just loud at their own table.", "NTA. I think your comment was a bit too snippy and you could have been more direct with them sooner but it sounded like they couldn't control their children. Of course children are going to make some noise but if the parents can't stop them from repeatedly shouting they should find a more child-friendly place or not eat out.", "YTA because you really had no need to complain to the father other than wanting to pick a fight with him. \n\nAt those ages, it's not even a question of parenting that determines how noisy they are in public, even the most angelic little darlings will fidget and make noise in any environment. What are parents supposed to do, confine themselves at home for 18 years?\n\nThe father's comment about not being able to eat out as a family sealed the deal for me. You were both in that restaurant under special circumstances, your dinner was inadvertently ruined because you couldn't ignore some kids, so you decided to PURPOSEFULLY ruin theirs by picking a fight. Total AH move.", "YTA.   Your in public, you dont get to control others.   I don't have kids and find them annoying in restaurants too but it's part of going out.   Besides, if it's the type of place you have a laptop open and earbuds in I don't think we are talking a fine dining establishment here.   People with kids get to exist too.", "NTA I am a parent of 5, when your kid starts acting like that you leave.  \n\nIt's such selfish and entitled behaviour to disturb everyone else's peace.", "Honestly, ESH. I understand your frustration, but unless the restaurant is specifically labeled as child-free, they have as much right to be there as you do, and at 4 and 2 kids are not yet at the age where they completely understand the rules of the place, especially the two-year-old one. Had they been older, it would be completely on the parents, but at early toddlerhood, it's just how kids are.", "Nta. You put on headphones and even moved, while I wouldn\u2019t have told him anything and just kept thinking that the kids were loud that\u2019s maybe where you\u2019re getting the Y T A. These sound like abnormally loud children, and while children are allowed to exist in places being abnormally loud is a different thing. I have 20+ cousins ranging from literal 1 year old to the oldest being 26, and I spent a good amount of time with them all as I was a teen and they were babies and toddlers. I can count in a single hand the number of times any and all of them behaved badly in a restaurant, because their parents helped socialize them to restaurants and their social expectations early. They all play with each other, but never so loud that anyone has complained. There\u2019s a difference between kids being kids and the parents just straight up being noise blind to their spawns screeches. For some odd reason you see babies and toddlers and children of all ages in nice upscale restaurants in Europe and South America, maybe it\u2019s a social expectation, maybe it\u2019s cultural, I don\u2019t know. But a good majority of them are all behaved, eating \u201cgrown up\u201d food, and know well enough to not be yelling in restaurants.", "I\u2019d say YTA. I understand your frustration but you\u2019re in a public place. If you can\u2019t withstand noise, stay at home. Children need to learn how to act appropriately in public and going to restaurants is one of the ways they do. From what you\u2019re saying, the children were quite young, so it is normal that they will shout or cry. They didn\u2019t seem to run around like spoilt brats. I assume the parents did their best to control them but that age is very challenging. I\u2019ve been to restaurants with entitled drunk adults, and their behaviour is always a lot worse than toddlers. In short, that family had as much right to go out to the restaurant as you did.", "Yeah you\u2019re a bit of an AH here. It\u2019s frustrating, but they\u2019ve got as much right to be there as you do. Get over yourself. YTA.", "NTA - ignore the pissy parents\n\nNO ONE wants to go out for ANYTHING and have to deal with the immense pleasure of screaming crying kids. \n\nUnfortunately, the only thing you can do is go to places that are just patently not kid friendly.\n\nBut, I've seen geniuses bring kids to bars, so...", "ESH, they decided to have kids, not the whole world. Kids shouldn't seize to exist in public, but their paretns should be mindful of disturbing others. I mean, if your kids are this loud - get a sitter and go out in piace or at least TRY to keep them quiet.\n\nAs for OP, you didn't need to escalate. You already made your position clear when asking to switch the table. Saying it out loud and directly once when paying was okayish, but going full out arguing wasn't necessary.\n\nI do belive a tone of people would give this down votes but here's my position: if there was a full grown up being that loud, society would come at him with pichforks, but when there is a KID whose parents don't give a shit about screaming / crying / being loud in public it is the same. It is a disturbance. Mind you, if parents at least tried to calm kids down it's perfectly fine, but some parents think if they need to suffer their monster screaming matches - so should everyone in public. That is not an okay mindset.", "YTA. Kids are part of the general public. If you are somewhere the general public can be, you need to accept that kids will be there too. Yes they could have taken the kid out when they started crying but the reality is sometimes kids end up crying and being a dick to them or their parents is not appropriate.", "NTA But next time complain to management first.\n\nI'm guessing it's much easier for them to caution/remove a family if guests have complained. Management does not like have their other guests pissed off by this.\n\nSorta reminds me when I was in an elegant rural restaurant, and the waitress asked me if I minded if the other table had an after dinner smoke. I was a bit bemused and said: But aren't you none smoking?\n\nYes but they told me to ask you.\n\nDo you want to let them smoke?\n\nNo\n\nThen I refuse. I don't want them smoking.", "ESH, assuming this truly was not a child-friendly restaurant.  The family should have used better judgment about where to bring their young children for dinner, but you went out of your way to be a jerk about the situation when it was too late for the family to do anything to address your concerns.", "YTA for the way you did it. If you would have politely asked during your meal if they could be a little quieter, that\u2019s okay. \n\nYou waited until after to make a snide comment.\n\nI find it hard to believe that any restaurant okay with you working on your laptop is also going to be a high end restaurant it is inappropriate to take kids too.\n\nGet over yourself.", "I need more info, does this establishment have a child\u2019s menu?", "YTA.  You were lashing out at him in anger and there was zero reason to confront him.  What did it achieve other than making yourself feel momentarily better?\n\nNext time talk to management and see what they can do.", "You\u2019re both the asshole tbh.", "YTA. Children exist and they do make noise. And parents are perfectly entitled to go out to a meal with their children. Who may well make noise. \n\nIf you have a problem with kids that's not the parents issue.\n\nIf you want a silent meal get a takeout and eat it at home where children can't offend you.", "YTA they have a right to be there.", "YTA - I hate when people go to public places and then complain about other people making noise. Get take out and go home if you want to ge able to control the noise. That family had the same right as you to be there. And while missing *some* social events is apart of parenting, this restaurant does not sound like it was an adults only venue\u2026.so this would not be one of them.", "YTA learn to mind your own business.", "ESH\nYou didn't speak up until you were leaving. You could have asked them to be more quiet when it became uncomfortable, when improving the situation was possible. Instead, you waited until you were leaving to complain to the parents.\n\nIn future, consider asking your server to be moved to a quieter area of the restaurant. That's a possible and realistic solution that doesn't rely on other patrons changing their behavior.", "AH.. at least you came across a fairly nice parent cause if it was me I wouldn\u2019t have been nice.. being a parent does not mean they have to sacrifice going out.. kids are loud.. so what?? Deal with it or leave.. but to approach that family like you had some right.. I would\u2019ve made you think twice before you ever did that again.. it\u2019s already hard enough being a parent without AH like you making them feel terrible for being out in public with their kids..", "YTA you need to realize that the same way you don\u2019t go out often and want to enjoy your meal, the family ALSO might not get out often.

Yes you have a right to be there, sure. But did you have a right to stand up and disturb another family having dinner? Nope. It essentially puts you on par with the noisy toddler. You can\u2019t control yourself to be quiet either, can you?\n\nWith that being said, kids are assholes. I have two of them. They are not miniature adults. They are human beings with the attention span of 2 minutes and in a constant state of some sort of psychosis.

But they didn\u2019t choose their exact circumstances. For example, when I had my children, I could always rely on a dear friend of mine to watch my kiddos for me when I wanted to go on a date or needed to get out of the house. She was their godmother and I trusted her to love my girls as she\u2019d love her own. But her life was extinguished in three days when she got covid. Living somewhere where we don\u2019t have a lot of family, we don\u2019t have a lot of babysitter options and the person I trusted my children with is no longer with us. Yes I chose to have children, but I didn\u2019t choose to lose their godmother who was young and vibrant and had her whole life to live. Circumstances change.\n\nPerhaps they were celebrating. Maybe the mother got a promotion too or maybe it was the dad\u2019s birthday. Maybe they were celebrating an anniversary and wanted their whole family together. \n\nWhatever reason they were there at the same time as you, they had every right to be there just as much as you. It is our jobs as parents to raise good humans. And we can\u2019t do that without taking them out into the world to practice. To teach them manners and to be quiet. But kids are psychotic and don\u2019t listen. So it\u2019s an everyday reminder kind of thing until they\u2019re adults and move out. \n\nEven you, my dear young entitled, OP, were once a shitty, snotty, noisy toddler, disturbing others in public and I\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve wanted random strangers to show your mother a little grace and empathy, during a moment that was probably rather embarrassing for her.

Apologies for not being more clear from the start. Federal law protects the basics of protected characteristics. States can expand on these where they feel it is appropriate. Many states choose to add that any place which provides lodging, food, or what could be considered an essential service, cannot discriminate based on familial status or age. Familial status is the state of having children usually. So the discrimination alleged is that parents are put under undue hardship by being denied access to these essential services. While a business could choose to fight this, it would not be cost effective, so threats and lawsuits are usually enough to keep businesses from instituting such policies.

As booze is not an essential service and restriction is based on the inability of children to actually be patrons. They can\u2019t be served.\n\nEdit: I can also institute a rule for my business that says \u201cno one with brown eyes will be served\u201d and as long as no one says anything I\u2019ll get away with it.

Plus, if my kids were crying, screaming, etc. I would attempt to quiet them down, and if that didn\u2019t work I would bring them out. I would then calm them down and try again. If it didn\u2019t work a second time, then I\u2019d leave to be respectful of others, as that\u2019s my nature. However, there is also a huge difference between my kids being loud because they\u2019re upset vs them just laughing and being happy (though there is still a noise level that I try to keep it under when they\u2019re happy). So the way this family handled it was not ok. They should have also been respectful towards the other people and brought the kids out if they were too loud and wouldn\u2019t quiet down.

Its that simple. Its part of the price of parenting.", "You are  50 / 50, I understand you wanted a quiet meal and felt frustrated that the kids were too loud for your taste, even after you moved to another table.  However, you kind of are the asshole for the smart-ass comment at the end with the dad.  It sounded like you said that to try and bait them into an argument.  From reading it looks like you did.   Did you not think he wouldn't say anything back? Use a little more tact and common sense.", "ESH.  You moved tables but you could still hear them\u2014get over it.

Nice to see you!", "I worked in a Thai place once and a lady called asking for sweet and sour pork.\n\nMe: sorry we don't sell sweet and sour pork\n\nHer: well what do you have that's like sweet and sour pork\n\nMe: uh, I'm not really sure that's a pretty specific dish. We're a Thai restaurant.\n\nHer: well I've got 15 ten year olds to feed! What are they meant to eat? They don't like spicy food!\n\nLike?? Call a fucking Chinese restaurant if you want Chinese food? I also don't have bouillabaisse or borscht. I have Thai food because that's what we sell.", "Lol! I personally also find crying children in public horrible. I find most people in public horrible.

I get that you were hoping for a peaceful quiet meal and that didn\u2019t happen but you get into AH behavior for starting an argument with total strangers because you didn\u2019t get to have the environment you were hoping for in a public space. I get being annoyed. I ride the NYC subways and eat at NYC restaurants so I get how your expectations can really be dashed but it\u2019s not helpful to just go add your chaos to the void. There might have been someone in that restaurant who didn\u2019t want to hear two strangers arguing but they did. Being in public is wild.", "Info: why are you on your laptop in a nice restaurant?

I don't know, does some of that guilt carry over for people? Lots of guys here chat for a day or two them poof and never meet up regardless how it's going.

If we can't do early bird we skip to rule 2 call to reserve and and advise of children and request to be seated so.ewhere that will be least disruptive and or close to kid zone if available.\n\nEven with those rules we never go anywhere more fancy than the pub, club (Aussie so retired services club), or occasionally hogs breath cafe. It is also the only time we allow electronics at the dinner table (when no kid zone). \n\nI hate it when my kids interrupt or disturb others and do my best to find a medium ground (they need to practice their manners in the real world) but if they are too restless we leave as quickly as possible.

We finally ordered a bottle of wine so we didn\u2019t have to keep flagging staff for a drink and it came room temperature with no ice bucket and 2 glasses instead of 3, I had to seek out a member of staff for another glass. \nIt had taken so long for the food to come we skipped our usual puddings and my friend usually had Irish coffee, we then had to get up again to chase someone for the bill. \nWe were rushing as my friend had a train to catch and were told to sit and wait\u2026 10 minutes went by and I had to get up and chase someone again to ask. \n\nWe usually left a \u00a310-\u00a315 tip but agreed we weren\u2019t leaving anything that night. The bill came with it added on and we were planning on paying on one card. \nI was mortified to ask for them to take it off and my partner and best friend weren\u2019t comfortable either. \nThe bill was \u00a3108 so my partner quickly went to the cash machine and we left \u00a3110 in cash. \n\nI went back there last week with just my partner and we withdrew cash first in case it happened again, the service was much better and I noticed that the gratuity wasn\u2019t included on the bill anymore. \n\nI have been on the other side as well and worked in hospitality for years, I never expected a tip they were just a great bonus. \nThe funniest thing was that my last job was as a restaurant manager and I was in charge of the tips - the worst tippers were American! \n\nWhen I first started the staff used to get so excited when we had American customers thinking they would get a big tip. \nWe didn\u2019t get many but the ones who did visit either left nothing or more then often just change. \n\nI knew it wasn\u2019t the service as I would closely monitor staff service and there would be plenty of other tips on the same night. \nIt was like some Americans would look at tip etiquette in the UK and see it wasn\u2019t expected and leave nothing, that\u2019s fair enough the staff were paid very well. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t an issue as no one expected it, but they also hardly ever ordered drinks and just had the tap water we automatically provided. \n\nThis is of course just what I observed.

Never had a problem.\n\nBut I see so many kids that are just sitting there with nothing to entertain them.  It's boring sitting at a table when you are a kid, until you get old enough to enjoy conversation whilst you wait for food etc.  And those are the kids that end up acting out.", "Same thing happened to my spouse and I. 8:30pm reservation at the fancy French restaurant in Mickey\u2019s fanciest hotel. Seated next to a family of 4 with a clearly distressed toddler having a meltdown and a roughly 7 year old child literally asleep in their chair. Parents just carried on with their meal (and wine) without a second thought to how selfish they were being towards their own children, let alone another diners."]}
