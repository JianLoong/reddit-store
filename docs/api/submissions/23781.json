So I went to my favourite restaurant restaurant to treat myself to my favourite meal. \n\nIt was all great at first. I had my laptop and got some work done as I waited for my food. I had just started eating when a family of four with kids around the age of 4 and 2 sat at the table beside mine. I was surprised because It's not an environment known to be hospitable to kids overall. \n\nInitially, the kids were quiet. It got progressively worse as they sat there. The little one was crying, the older one was shouting. And they went on and on. My sound cancelling earbuds didn't help me much. So I asked to move to a different table.\n\nThe restaurant isn't very big so I could still hear them crying and shouting. I barely enjoyed my food and was really angry because I very rarely get to have time for myself and I really wanted to enjoy this. \n\nAs I was paying, I told the father that I hoped they enjoyed their meal, because I barely could. He got mad and said I had no right to say anything about them, and went on to say he had barely had the time to eat out as a family and that I was being rude for no reason.\n\nI said sacrificing social events is part of parenting and that their kids were particularly loud.

It's becoming increasingly common for parents to not only bring their children to not-child-friendly locations but also to let them act ridiculous while there.  And they won't care that *your* day or experience was ruined.", "INFO: How do you say that the restaurant is not an environment known to be hospitable to kids overall?", "NTA - but going out in public always means we may have to interact with the more annoying people of that public.  We are all part of a society and unfortunately society also contains a lot of inconsiderate and annoying people.  I wouldn't blame the kids in this situation, but rather the parents. Kids are small, loud and their brains and social behaviors are not fully developed.  If I'm out in public with my kids and they are being annoying, I tell them to stop...and if they don't, I'll remove them from the place.  Not all people are like that though.  Just yesterday we were having a bite to eat and the people at the table next to us started chatting with us.  One of their kids was the rudest, least pleasant little shit I have ever met.  Like this 6-7 year old kids was a straight up asshole.  If one of my kids spoke to strangers (us) and other kids (mine) the way this kid did, I would  be appalled and there would be consequences.  These people didn't give a fuck. Some people just don't care about how they impact others around them.", "NTA, you could\u2019ve been more polite, and that\u2019s the route I would\u2019ve taken personally, but there is a limit. While it\u2019s reasonable in a clearly family friendly restaurant to hear children, even that has an expectation of some respectful noise level. The wait staff really should\u2019ve been the ones to politely ask them to rein the situation in so other guests could enjoy their meals, but they failed to do that and frustration is not an uncommon outcome. Next time I would try saying something to the staff first, and more politely to the family if that didn\u2019t resolve it. It won\u2019t work but it\u2019s worth a try.\n\nEdit: So everyone knows, but \u201cchildfree\u201d spaces legally don\u2019t and can\u2019t exist. This is very frustrating because parents will say \u201cif you don\u2019t like it, you need to go somewhere where kids aren\u2019t allowed.\u201d The only places that can legally bar children from coming in are places that include things like smoking and nudity. It\u2019s even more difficult if food is served. This is why kids are in casinos, even with smoking. People without children (and parents looking for a night off) don\u2019t necessarily want to be in bars and strip clubs every time they go out. When people have attempted to lobby for childfree spaces, parents have shut it down with protesting and cries of discrimination. So one of two things has to happen: either allow childfree spaces legally, or don\u2019t bring children to spaces clearly geared toward adults as a matter of courtesy. Yes, \u201cthey have as much right to be there as everyone else\u201d because it has been made deliberately impossible for people to have a space where kids aren\u2019t. \n\nSo you\u2019re literally saying \u201cget your own space!\u201d Then we try and you say \u201cyou\u2019re discriminating! You can\u2019t have your own space!\u201d This is why it\u2019s hard to have sympathy when I read an article about how adults are ruining Disneyland or whatever for kids, or about how someone got frustrated with your kids in a fancy restaurant. You\u2019re the one excluding us (and by us, I mean any adult that wants to spend an evening in the company of other adults, including parents) from public life, not the other way around. Bottom line: \u201callows children\u201d is not the same as \u201cfor children.\u201d\n\nEdit: to be clear, this varies by state. While age and familial status are not federally protected, many states choose to add them, the discrimination that is alleged when businesses attempt to age restrict their patrons is that parents of children are excluded or placed under undue burden, so they would be protected against discrimination based on having children, and the children themselves can be protected by age. This means that businesses open themselves up to costly lawsuits that many cannot afford by attempting to be adults only. I should\u2019ve clarified. Apologies.", "NTA ignore all the shitty parents in the comments", "YTA unless it was a bar or a particularly fancy restaurant. The kids were not running around creating chaos, they were just loud at their own table.", "NTA. I think your comment was a bit too snippy and you could have been more direct with them sooner but it sounded like they couldn't control their children. Of course children are going to make some noise but if the parents can't stop them from repeatedly shouting they should find a more child-friendly place or not eat out.", "YTA because you really had no need to complain to the father other than wanting to pick a fight with him. \n\nAt those ages, it's not even a question of parenting that determines how noisy they are in public, even the most angelic little darlings will fidget and make noise in any environment. What are parents supposed to do, confine themselves at home for 18 years?\n\nThe father's comment about not being able to eat out as a family sealed the deal for me. You were both in that restaurant under special circumstances, your dinner was inadvertently ruined because you couldn't ignore some kids, so you decided to PURPOSEFULLY ruin theirs by picking a fight. Total AH move.", "YTA.   Your in public, you dont get to control others.   I don't have kids and find them annoying in restaurants too but it's part of going out.   Besides, if it's the type of place you have a laptop open and earbuds in I don't think we are talking a fine dining establishment here.   People with kids get to exist too.", "NTA I am a parent of 5, when your kid starts acting like that you leave.  \n\nIt's such selfish and entitled behaviour to disturb everyone else's peace.", "Honestly, ESH. I understand your frustration, but unless the restaurant is specifically labeled as child-free, they have as much right to be there as you do, and at 4 and 2 kids are not yet at the age where they completely understand the rules of the place, especially the two-year-old one. Had they been older, it would be completely on the parents, but at early toddlerhood, it's just how kids are.", "Nta. You put on headphones and even moved, while I wouldn\u2019t have told him anything and just kept thinking that the kids were loud that\u2019s maybe where you\u2019re getting the Y T A. These sound like abnormally loud children, and while children are allowed to exist in places being abnormally loud is a different thing. I have 20+ cousins ranging from literal 1 year old to the oldest being 26, and I spent a good amount of time with them all as I was a teen and they were babies and toddlers. I can count in a single hand the number of times any and all of them behaved badly in a restaurant, because their parents helped socialize them to restaurants and their social expectations early. They all play with each other, but never so loud that anyone has complained. There\u2019s a difference between kids being kids and the parents just straight up being noise blind to their spawns screeches. For some odd reason you see babies and toddlers and children of all ages in nice upscale restaurants in Europe and South America, maybe it\u2019s a social expectation, maybe it\u2019s cultural, I don\u2019t know. But a good majority of them are all behaved, eating \u201cgrown up\u201d food, and know well enough to not be yelling in restaurants.", "I\u2019d say YTA. I understand your frustration but you\u2019re in a public place. If you can\u2019t withstand noise, stay at home. Children need to learn how to act appropriately in public and going to restaurants is one of the ways they do. From what you\u2019re saying, the children were quite young, so it is normal that they will shout or cry. They didn\u2019t seem to run around like spoilt brats. I assume the parents did their best to control them but that age is very challenging. I\u2019ve been to restaurants with entitled drunk adults, and their behaviour is always a lot worse than toddlers. In short, that family had as much right to go out to the restaurant as you did.", "Yeah you\u2019re a bit of an AH here. It\u2019s frustrating, but they\u2019ve got as much right to be there as you do. Get over yourself. YTA.", "NTA - ignore the pissy parents\n\nNO ONE wants to go out for ANYTHING and have to deal with the immense pleasure of screaming crying kids. \n\nUnfortunately, the only thing you can do is go to places that are just patently not kid friendly.\n\nBut, I've seen geniuses bring kids to bars, so...", "ESH, they decided to have kids, not the whole world. Kids shouldn't seize to exist in public, but their paretns should be mindful of disturbing others. I mean, if your kids are this loud - get a sitter and go out in piace or at least TRY to keep them quiet.\n\nAs for OP, you didn't need to escalate. You already made your position clear when asking to switch the table. Saying it out loud and directly once when paying was okayish, but going full out arguing wasn't necessary.\n\nI do belive a tone of people would give this down votes but here's my position: if there was a full grown up being that loud, society would come at him with pichforks, but when there is a KID whose parents don't give a shit about screaming / crying / being loud in public it is the same. It is a disturbance. Mind you, if parents at least tried to calm kids down it's perfectly fine, but some parents think if they need to suffer their monster screaming matches - so should everyone in public. That is not an okay mindset.", "YTA. Kids are part of the general public. If you are somewhere the general public can be, you need to accept that kids will be there too. Yes they could have taken the kid out when they started crying but the reality is sometimes kids end up crying and being a dick to them or their parents is not appropriate.", "NTA But next time complain to management first.\n\nI'm guessing it's much easier for them to caution/remove a family if guests have complained. Management does not like have their other guests pissed off by this.\n\nSorta reminds me when I was in an elegant rural restaurant, and the waitress asked me if I minded if the other table had an after dinner smoke. I was a bit bemused and said: But aren't you none smoking?\n\nYes but they told me to ask you.\n\nDo you want to let them smoke?\n\nNo\n\nThen I refuse. I don't want them smoking.", "ESH, assuming this truly was not a child-friendly restaurant.  The family should have used better judgment about where to bring their young children for dinner, but you went out of your way to be a jerk about the situation when it was too late for the family to do anything to address your concerns.", "YTA for the way you did it. If you would have politely asked during your meal if they could be a little quieter, that\u2019s okay. \n\nYou waited until after to make a snide comment.\n\nI find it hard to believe that any restaurant okay with you working on your laptop is also going to be a high end restaurant it is inappropriate to take kids too.\n\nGet over yourself.", "I need more info, does this establishment have a child\u2019s menu?", "YTA.  You were lashing out at him in anger and there was zero reason to confront him.  What did it achieve other than making yourself feel momentarily better?\n\nNext time talk to management and see what they can do.", "You\u2019re both the asshole tbh.", "YTA. Children exist and they do make noise. And parents are perfectly entitled to go out to a meal with their children. Who may well make noise. \n\nIf you have a problem with kids that's not the parents issue.\n\nIf you want a silent meal get a takeout and eat it at home where children can't offend you.", "YTA they have a right to be there.", "YTA - I hate when people go to public places and then complain about other people making noise. Get take out and go home if you want to ge able to control the noise. That family had the same right as you to be there. And while missing *some* social events is apart of parenting, this restaurant does not sound like it was an adults only venue\u2026.so this would not be one of them.", "YTA learn to mind your own business.", "ESH\nYou didn't speak up until you were leaving. You could have asked them to be more quiet when it became uncomfortable, when improving the situation was possible. Instead, you waited until you were leaving to complain to the parents.\n\nIn future, consider asking your server to be moved to a quieter area of the restaurant. That's a possible and realistic solution that doesn't rely on other patrons changing their behavior.", "AH.. at least you came across a fairly nice parent cause if it was me I wouldn\u2019t have been nice.. being a parent does not mean they have to sacrifice going out.. kids are loud.. so what?? Deal with it or leave.. but to approach that family like you had some right.. I would\u2019ve made you think twice before you ever did that again.. it\u2019s already hard enough being a parent without AH like you making them feel terrible for being out in public with their kids..", "YTA you need to realize that the same way you don\u2019t go out often and want to enjoy your meal, the family ALSO might not get out often.

You can\u2019t control yourself to be quiet either, can you?\n\nWith that being said, kids are assholes. I have two of them. They are not miniature adults. They are human beings with the attention span of 2 minutes and in a constant state of some sort of psychosis.

She was their godmother and I trusted her to love my girls as she\u2019d love her own. But her life was extinguished in three days when she got covid. Living somewhere where we don\u2019t have a lot of family, we don\u2019t have a lot of babysitter options and the person I trusted my children with is no longer with us.

It is our jobs as parents to raise good humans. And we can\u2019t do that without taking them out into the world to practice. To teach them manners and to be quiet.

Apologies for not being more clear from the start. Federal law protects the basics of protected characteristics. States can expand on these where they feel it is appropriate. Many states choose to add that any place which provides lodging, food, or what could be considered an essential service, cannot discriminate based on familial status or age. Familial status is the state of having children usually. So the discrimination alleged is that parents are put under undue hardship by being denied access to these essential services. While a business could choose to fight this, it would not be cost effective, so threats and lawsuits are usually enough to keep businesses from instituting such policies.

As booze is not an essential service and restriction is based on the inability of children to actually be patrons. They can\u2019t be served.\n\nEdit: I can also institute a rule for my business that says \u201cno one with brown eyes will be served\u201d and as long as no one says anything I\u2019ll get away with it.

That will mean less turnover for tables and will cut into the amount of money the server will make during his/her shift.  \n\nCoffee shops or anyplace where you order/pay at the counter and then can sit or leave are fine to bring a laptop.  Restaurants where you are seated and served by a server, it's frowned upon.", "Yeah I'd agree with you there. Although my niece has two boys similar age to ops table neighbour. She is totally oblivious, it can be a nice restaurant or a cafe or a burger king and they will just run around and shout and do what they want and as long as no one's crying she ignores it.  When pulled up on it she has the attitude of it's only kids, it's only a burger king, it's just life with kids etc....  Nope. It's mortifying. Kids end up beyond it. Everyone's stressed. And as I said to her. A burger king meal for one is a full hour's wage for a lot of people.

Getting a tip is much less important in the UK because there's a minimum wage, so there's less rush to clear the table which means you more frequently see people eating at a casual restaurant and working on their laptop. \n\nI think it's part of the reason that some American visitors to Europe and the UK are confused by how slow they find service in restaurants. There's just not the rush to turn the table over, outside of very busy tourist spots where the waiting staff absolutely will hover and ask if you \"want anything else, are you sure? no, really? absolutely sure? not even a coffee?\" to subtly tell you to fuck off so they can seat someone else.", "Of course it does.
