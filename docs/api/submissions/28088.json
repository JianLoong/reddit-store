She said he's my daddy at work. They are friends on FB and from what I can gather she has only friended my husband from work since 2017 since he and I share almost all of our friends including his work friends. Am I the AH for thinking this is inappropriate work behavior? He literally said that the term daddy in this case was used as a term of endearment. Either I'm over reacting, my husband is cheating or he's an absolute idiot. To be fair she did seem genuinely protective of my feelings (but side chick like, even if there isn't anything going on) and she is single which is not a mark against her. I feel like this is my husbands fault more than anything and that is why I laid into him so hard, just utter dissapointment.", "created_utc": 1696287238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yba9l/aitah_for_laying_into_my_husband_because_his/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s super cringy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s cheating, and I\u2019m not even sure he\u2019s aware of how odd that is, but it\u2019s definitely a weird situation.

Highly inappropriate", "Daddy, and she\u2019s 26??? I think she knows damn well.", "She\u2019s (at minimum) flirting by using Daddy\u2026.

It's wildly inappropriate and he's a first-rate idiot if he doesn't see that. You know the man... is he really that oblivious?", "NTA. I have my work mom, and that\u2019s my supervisor. She\u2019s awesome and a wonderful supervisor/friend. And I call her mom when she protects me from any bs.

He yells at anyone who does that. I\u2019m the expert, he\u2019s the boss), bc we work together a lot, and we\u2019re all very close.

It\u2019s a term of endearment from me to them bc they are so protective of me. \n\nBut if I ever called them mommy and daddy, that would just hit different.

The word she is looking for, and he needs to correct her with, is \u201cmentor.\u201d I\u2019ll chalk it up to them both being oblivious based on your own take, but \u201cdaddy\u201d is a very problematic word to be flinging around in a professional context, no matter what the intent.", "NTA. It's totally inappropriate and if your husband doesn't get that, you have a bigger problem.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband certainly is.

He should have had the awareness and smarts to tell Ms. EZ Breeze not to use that term of endearment in front of you and to be professional.

Ron White said it best...you can't fix....you know.", "NTA- but she could just be hella immature too.

Inappropriate, attempted flirting she can laugh off as \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that\u201d if it\u2019s not reciprocated.
