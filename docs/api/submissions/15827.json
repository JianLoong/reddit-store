There are four of us in this close friend group and we usually do something fun celebrating both of us and that sometimes includes trips. I really wanted to go to Miami for the weekend and everyone was on board until Toph announced she was going to Cabo for her birthday weekend and her parents are covering lodging for all of us. We definitely couldn\u2019t afford two trips, both financially and taking time off from work, but I\u2019m amenable and while I was irked Miami wasn\u2019t going to happen I was on board with Mexico. \n\nNow for whatever reason flights at this time to Mexico are like a grand (compared to the ~$300 it\u2019d be to get to Miami) but I figured okay no problem since lodging is covered it\u2019s kind of a wash. Everything\u2019s going fine until Toph texts us that her parents can no longer pay for lodging bc it\u2019s some all inclusive type of place and too expensive for them. It was jarring for that to be offered then taken back but these things happen. \n\nSo now the 4 of us have been discussing what we should do. Toph and one of the other friends, Azula, say that no matter what they\u2019re still going to the same all inclusive place in Cabo and that we should just pay for it ourselves. Already this birthday weekend is getting out of hand financially and the fourth friend, katara and I are not about it. We\u2018ve been trying to tell toph and azula that we should get some affordable place to stay mainly for financial reasons but also because if we do an all inclusive place we\u2019re going to want to just stay there the whole time to try and get our moneys worth and it won\u2019t be as fun. Toph and Azula convinced us the place would be worth it and splitting it four ways wouldn\u2019t be that bad so katara and I conceded. \n\nThen after we\u2019ve booked everything Azula says in the group chat, \u201cwait, it\u2019s Toph\u2019s birthday, she shouldn\u2019t have to pay for it.\u201d Toph almost immediately starts thanking us for offering to pay for her which is super awkward for Katara and I. We didn\u2019t offer to pay for her, Azula did for us. We didn\u2019t even want to go to Mexico in the first place, we only conceded to going since lodging was supposed to be included. Then on top of that we have to pay our own share of lodging and pay for tophs as well. \n\nSo katara and I said we\u2019re just not going to go at all. Toph and Azula are livid at us for deciding not to go and calling us bad friends for leaving them on the hook financially. It\u2019s caused a lot of turmoil and this whole friend group is about to implode because of what was supposed to be a fun trip.

NTA  I would have just booked Miami.", "The whole situation sounds like a convoluted bait and switch...\n\nWe're going to Cabo, and lodging is paid for!\n\nNope, sorry, but lidging is not included, but we've all agreed to go there, so we're still going!\n\nOh, hey... you all get to pay for Tophm and we all agreed to go and you will be an AH if you pull out!\n\nI am curious... have you confirmed that the parents ever offered to pay for lodging? It all sounds a bit suspicious...\n\nNTA", "*So katara and I said we\u2019re just not going to go at all.*\n\nGood.  That's putting your own needs first, and it's what you should be doing.\n\n*Toph and Azula are livid at us for deciding not to go and calling us bad friends for leaving them on the hook financially. It\u2019s caused a lot of turmoil and this whole friend group is about to implode because of what was supposed to be a fun trip.*\n\nThis group is imploding because of their behaviors, not yours.  You had an original plan that was affordable for everyone and everyone was on board with it.\n\nToph changed the plans, insisted it was affordable because of parents' support, withdrew the parent support.\n\nThen Toph and Azula insist this plan go forward anyway, that splitting costs will make it work, and they get the two of you to agree.  Then they change the plan again, to get you two to pay more.\n\nAre you sure that they aren't working as a team here to do this to you two?  Every step has been manipulating the two of you into this trip.  Are you sure that Toph's parents were ever even asked to pay for this?  Have these two done things like this to you two before?  Forgotten wallets?  Made you pay for the cab?\n\nYou two are right to stop this trip happening.  And if the group implodes, it's time to let it.  Maybe to even have the two of you stop talking to them for month or so, if they are going to blame you two for the manipulative things they did, or tried to do, to you both.\n\nHere's the thing.  They knew that this trip wasn't affordable for you two.  They knew.  And insisted on it from the beginning.  And every step since then, they are adding more financial burden to the two of you, knowing that you only agreed in the first place because of the supposed parent financial support.  That's not a thing good friends do to you.  Good friends don't try to ruin your finances and make you use up your emergency fund to fund their amusement.  Good friends respect your needs.\n\nLet them go.  Block them.  \n\nEdit:  NTA.", "It sounds like 'Toph' set you up and knew that her parents WEREN'T going to pay for the Cabo trip at all and just wanted you to cancel your Miami trip.  I'd be major league ticked off, SHE is the AH, not you.  I'd bail on that trip and reconsider my friendship with her.", "Plus, OP and Toph were born around the same time, and this was supposedly supposed to be a joint birthday trip. So why would OP take on the extra cost of paying for Toph, when no one's willing to pay for OP?", "Miami is governed by evil?", "definitely not Mai. wouldn't care enough whether people thought she was an AH or not.", "I'm surprised something about these guys isn't higher up.\n\nBut yeah OP is NTA. You already changed your plans because of their promise of covering it, then they didn't cover it so you're overspending, and now you pay for her? No. Was she going to pay for you to go to Miami? No.", "I don't doubt it. Sneaky-Sneaker McSneakerstein...or so she tried to be.", "I was actually wondering if Toph was lying the entire time and just didn\u2019t want to go to Miami, they sound toxic. \n\nThe text about them all paying for toph sounded planned and calculated.", "She switched the trip to match her date, didn't she? You were originally going to Miami at a slightly different time, and she got everyone to abandon that plan and travel after your birthday and on her birthday so now it's not your birthday trip or your combined birthday trip, it's all about her. Correct me if I'm wrong?", "I always thought it was Toth, not Toph, so it took me a minute... lol.", "This was my very first thought!", "Fire nation in shambles over a trip to Cabo", "NTA. Toph sounds like a bad friend, as does Azula. I would go to Miami with Katara just the two of y\u2019all", "NTA\n\nToph and Azula can get (earth and fire) bent.", "NTA. You should have stuck with your original plan. Toph handled this whole thing really badly and should be apologizing to everyone for all the churn she caused.", "NTA and I love the Avatar names", "NTA. Um no. I went to Miami for my BFF\u2019s 40th birthday, the only thing that she didn\u2019t pay for at all was her birthday dinner and drinks on her actual birthday. Everything else she equally paid for with the rest of the group. It was her idea, not like a surprise gift of something.", "NTA \n\nThere was a lot of bait and switch happening here. Toph and  Azula don't sound like great friends TBH.", "NTA\u2026I do not think Toph was honest from the beginning.  She knew her parents were not going to pay for it.  She wanted to go and thought she found a way to do it. And I do not buy for a second that she was not behind having everyone pay for her.  Stay firm and say that you only conceded to the trip because your lodging was paid for and would help offset other costs.  That is no longer on the table and sorry, but not sorry, not paying for anyone else.  You did not leave anyone on the hook financially.  Toph did that all by herself.  If the two girls are mad, so be it.  It sounds like you and the other girl would have an amazing time in Miami.", "NTA. They kept shifting everything on you and you definitely shouldn\u2019t have to pay for what is essentially also your birthday trip. Also I love the fact you used names from Avatar the Last Airbender.", "Life is way too fucking short for this shit. Happy birthday.", "NTA\n\nThey had that planned. Take your money and your friend and go on a trip that you actually want to go on.", " \r  \nNTA. It's not fair for Toph and Azula to expect you and Katara to pay for Toph's birthday trip, especially when it wasn't even your idea to go to Mexico in the first place. You were willing to compromise and go to Mexico because lodging was supposed to be covered, but now that it's not, it's understandable that you and Katara don't want to spend a lot of money on a trip you didn't even want to take. It's not your responsibility to cover Toph's expenses just because it's her birthday. Toph and Azula are being unreasonable and should not be guilting you and Katara into paying for something you don't want to do.", "NTA.\n\nI very much doubt there was ever an offer from Toph's parents to pay for lodging. Toph and Azula wanted to go to Cabo and this was the bait and switch to get you and Katara to abandon your Miami plans and go with them, and further to try and pay for them. The whole bit about Azula saying 'Wait..' in group chat as if she just thought of it is also likely something she and Toph agreed on trying and doesn't ring as genuine with me.", "NTA\n\nNo one gets to spend your $$$ but you.  Toph and Azula deciding they wanted to spend LOTS of your money makes them the AH here.", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry your mid 20s are rough with friendships, especially older ones that you\u2019ve clearly outgrown. It\u2019s easy to brush thing aside when stakes are low, but you\u2019re trying to establish yourself, become financially sound, and these games put you in jeopardy.  This probably isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve been selfish but this is probably the most drastic example and you\u2019re seeing their true colors. Good luck and stand up for yourself, true friends will understand and apologize for their misstep.", "NTA... just say that at every turn the trip got more expensive and that it reached the point where it was no longer feasible.  If the costs had been planned and laid out, you would have declined at the first step.", "NTA, I smell something fishy.", "NTA- sounds kind of like Toph engineered this whole thing from the start.", "Nope, NTA. I\u2019ve done international birthday trips with friends before \u2014 heck, I did it last year for mine (and fyi, I paid for myself to get across the Atlantic and lodging). The **first** thing my friends and I did was discuss budget/location preferences and then we worked together to find places that worked for everyone who was interested. Some people had to drop out for various personal reasons and that was a shame, but there was never any fighting over the issues your friend group is imploding over. Why? Because we actually like and respect each other. \n\nHonestly, Toph and Azula sound like dreadful/selfish friends. I\u2019m skeptical Toph\u2019s parents even offered to pay for the all-inclusive in the first place \u2014 seems far more likely that Toph just wanted to hijack the birthday plans because she was mad your birthday would get the most attention and decided to make her day extra special at everyone else\u2019s expense. I personally think you should just go to Miami with Katara as originally planned and let Toph and Azula enjoy their extravagant money sink.", "NTA (either you or katara). I don\u2019t know what is up with those other two but they\u2019ve been baiting and switching you all along. Suckering you in with the \u201cparents are paying\u201d, oh wait..no they are not\u2026.and it\u2019ll be cheap split 4 ways\u2026oh wait, no, three ways with birthday girl going for free. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Toph and Azula cooked this up between them.", "Also so this is a \u201cbig trip\u201d (because of the more financial aspects.) Toph and OP\u2019s birthdays are two weeks apart they typically do things to celebrate THEM. Why is Toph special because it\u2019s /their/ birthday and not OP who\u2019s birthday would technically also be included? Based on OP stating they do birthday trips together.", "To be fair, OP *did* agree on paying for the all inclusive resort after it became clear the parents weren't going to pay. That's when everything got booked. So with that in mind, OP should just stick to what she agreed to. She can easily say she agreed to go and pay her own share, that's her gift to Toph, but she won't be paying Toph's share as well.", "The governor of Florida is Ron DeSantis. He is quite literally fascist, and instilling fascist laws and policies in Florida counties and districts. So yes, Florida is governed by evil.", "It does have Disney World, Carl Hiaasen, and Tim Dorsey going for it, but that's not enough.", "You need to wipe some of that froth from your mouth.  Good grief.", "fascist in your opinion, but fascists don't have state legislatures.  So...", "I dunno, maybe they think OP should get Azula scheming for their benefit?", "Yeah, hate is hate no matter if your left or right.", "Mussolini had a Parliament.", "Whatever makes you happy."]}
