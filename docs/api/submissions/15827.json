There are four of us in this close friend group and we usually do something fun celebrating both of us and that sometimes includes trips. I really wanted to go to Miami for the weekend and everyone was on board until Toph announced she was going to Cabo for her birthday weekend and her parents are covering lodging for all of us. We definitely couldn\u2019t afford two trips, both financially and taking time off from work, but I\u2019m amenable and while I was irked Miami wasn\u2019t going to happen I was on board with Mexico. \n\nNow for whatever reason flights at this time to Mexico are like a grand (compared to the ~$300 it\u2019d be to get to Miami) but I figured okay no problem since lodging is covered it\u2019s kind of a wash. Everything\u2019s going fine until Toph texts us that her parents can no longer pay for lodging bc it\u2019s some all inclusive type of place and too expensive for them. It was jarring for that to be offered then taken back but these things happen. \n\nSo now the 4 of us have been discussing what we should do. Toph and one of the other friends, Azula, say that no matter what they\u2019re still going to the same all inclusive place in Cabo and that we should just pay for it ourselves. Already this birthday weekend is getting out of hand financially and the fourth friend, katara and I are not about it. We\u2018ve been trying to tell toph and azula that we should get some affordable place to stay mainly for financial reasons but also because if we do an all inclusive place we\u2019re going to want to just stay there the whole time to try and get our moneys worth and it won\u2019t be as fun. Toph and Azula convinced us the place would be worth it and splitting it four ways wouldn\u2019t be that bad so katara and I conceded. \n\nThen after we\u2019ve booked everything Azula says in the group chat, \u201cwait, it\u2019s Toph\u2019s birthday, she shouldn\u2019t have to pay for it.\u201d Toph almost immediately starts thanking us for offering to pay for her which is super awkward for Katara and I. We didn\u2019t offer to pay for her, Azula did for us. We didn\u2019t even want to go to Mexico in the first place, we only conceded to going since lodging was supposed to be included. Then on top of that we have to pay our own share of lodging and pay for tophs as well. \n\nSo katara and I said we\u2019re just not going to go at all. Toph and Azula are livid at us for deciding not to go and calling us bad friends for leaving them on the hook financially. It\u2019s caused a lot of turmoil and this whole friend group is about to implode because of what was supposed to be a fun trip.
