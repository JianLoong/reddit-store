I actually had someone do this at my wedding. While my wife and I were off taking some photos, a longtime friend I had invited decided to make some homophobic remarks in front of a gay family member. He was asked to keep them to himself, and instead repeated them. A couple of my other guests took it upon themselves to tell him to leave, which he did while only telling me that he was leaving and that so-and-so was \u201cbeing an asshole\u201d (he was, in fact, the asshole).\nI didn\u2019t find out why he left early until later, but I was (and am) thankful that my friends stood up for my family member when I was out of earshot. I bought them beers after the fact and still consider them among my closest friends.\n\nTo me, you called out unacceptable behavior and dealt with it appropriately. I would have been more disappointed if you had waited any longer to deal with it. I think once the bride and groom have a few more days to think about it, they\u2019ll realize resting on formalities here was unnecessary: Even though it is their wedding, there\u2019s no way they would have made a different call (right?), so you saved them the headache of having to be involved in an embarrassing incident on an already stressful day.\n\nNTA, and it really isn\u2019t that hard for me.", "You made a tough call and I would\u2019ve handled it exactly the same. NTA", "NTA! I kicked someone out of my sisters wedding, too drunk, loud rude to family.", "It\u2019s everyone\u2019s duty to shun and remove creeps (and Nazis), from any and all venues. NTA.", "You should have advised them . It\u2019s their guest. Not yours. You could have asked Jessica to steer clear or move away instead before telling the wedded couple.", "This is a difficult judgement call, because there are people who genuinely would be grateful that you tried to handle this for them. Clearly your cousin and his wife aren't in this set. You did kick out one of their guests, and while you have the benefit of being family to all affected parties (which would give you the right at my wedding/party), it probably would have been best to check with one of the bridal party first. While no one should have to endure sexual harassment, at all, were things urgent enough that you couldn't have raised it with the best man first? Soft YTA", "YTA\n\nI think you handled it well and from a good place, but it wasn\u2019t your call to make. I think the bride/groom had the right to be aggravated that you kicked a guest out. To be fair, I probably would have done the same thing and been TA with you.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have the right to kick a guest out of someone else\u2019s wedding. The couple decided who stays and who leaves their wedding.", "YTA. You were well-intentioned, but I think you over-reacted. There were better ways to handle this.", "YTA. We didn\u2019t even get near the sexual harassment because you decided to get the guy kicked out because 1. You obviously don\u2019t like him for whatever reason and 2. He literally just said he liked her and nothing else happened. \n\nYou caused a scene, this could have been handled better and you could have gone discreetly to the husband at least with a heads up.", "YTA at the end of the day, you were a guest. You had no authority to do that, and should have told the bride and groom about the issue before moving forward. We\u2019re not excusing what Johnathan did, but you went about it wrong.", "N T A\n\nN T A \n\nN T A \n\nYou will never be the asshole for protecting women.
