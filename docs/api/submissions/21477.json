I actually had someone do this at my wedding. While my wife and I were off taking some photos, a longtime friend I had invited decided to make some homophobic remarks in front of a gay family member. He was asked to keep them to himself, and instead repeated them. A couple of my other guests took it upon themselves to tell him to leave, which he did while only telling me that he was leaving and that so-and-so was \u201cbeing an asshole\u201d (he was, in fact, the asshole).\nI didn\u2019t find out why he left early until later, but I was (and am) thankful that my friends stood up for my family member when I was out of earshot.

Same to everyone here saying it's not your \"place\" (in the physical or metaphorical sense lol). Stopping sexual harassment from escalating is EVERYONE'S duty, idgaf. \"Well it's MY wedding not yours\" \"well it's MY house not yours\" \"well it's MY pub not yours\" all those excuses and obsession with protocol tell me is that you're the type of person who'd let that attitude slide.\n\nLeaving this link here.

And frequently people with certain types of disabilities will say things out loud that many people would not and might even flirt in such a way.  It is quite harmless and people who know him know this.  \n\nSo I actually feel bad for Jonathan because on its face, I do not know why he would behave in such a way and I would not assume he is a typical person and would give him latitude, spend more time with him, talk to his closer family, and try to understand more.  I might have intervened in a different way.  \n\nI think it is important for people to understand that not everyone is typical and the \"disappearing\" thing could be another clue.  When you look at this situation as if Jonathan is a typical person, the behavior looks different to you than a person with social issues related to a disability.  \n\nYou probably should have talked to the bride and groom if you didn't know Jonathan's full situation first.  Because if this had happened to me and my family, the bride and groom in my family would have been mortified and really upset that someone threw my son out.  Then again, I probably would have been there with him at the time.", "Soft YTA. NTA for intervening, you absolutely did the right thing there, but after that you should have tipped off the bridal party and let them decide how to handle it.

Asking if she was single does not constitute a threat. You could have approached Jessica and warned her that Jonathan was her cousin and to keep and eye out for him. Surrounded by family and friends I expect she could easily have kept him at bay if he became obnoxious. \n\nIt is not all that unusual that a man would be interested in a girl he didn't know was his cousin. That doesn't mean he would have acted on it once he had been told (other to admire her from a distance). Unless something happened that you haven't told us about, you had no right to kick Jonathan out.

You see something like that you tell the people whose party it is. It is not your obligation nor right to play bouncer at their wedding.", "NAH, as I see both sides. I don\u2019t think you were out of line for kicking him out given that you are part of the family, but I can see how the bride & groom got to their position as well. Some couples want to know everything that\u2019s going on, weirdly. It was a difficult call to make and you made the call you thought was best for everyone, and you\u2019re not an asshole for that. \n\nNeither are the groom & bride out of line for feeling a bit miffed, too, since whatever happened at their wedding will end up reflecting upon them and I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re a bit embarrassed about creepy cousin making a scene. I would hope that they would come around to see your point, though. I suppose you could have gotten backup from a closer family member or bridal party member, but you were trying to handle it discretely and that means handling it simply & quietly.

Yeah, ok, they're *technically* correct, but who cares about that once they find out the reason? \n\nEven if you're *clearly* doing the right thing, if the bride/groom find out after the fact, they then have to worry for a moment that you made a mistake, totally misread a situation & just created drama they'll have to deal with later.

It\u2019s just a ridiculous perspective of OP\u2019s cousin and his new wife to have. Yes it\u2019s their big day but they\u2019re also not puppet masters controlling all the strings.

If he\u2019s that weird the situation needs to be addressed quickly. I had something slipped into my drink once and was out in ten mins(my friends got me thank god).

Also, maybe they felt like it was a drunken altercation, but again, it was justified. He\u2019s a major creep. \n\nMaybe he went to jail for years and that\u2019s where he was?", "YTA", "I don't think you were an ah here. I get that you didn't follow protocol but he needed removed.

You should have gone through the proper chains of authority. \n\nI agree with your actions, but ultimately, you did not pay or plan any part of the wedding.

Especially over another cousin!  \n\nYour cousin should be appreciative, not mad.", "I mean...ugh. \n\nLook, I sort of understand why you felt the need to cut in front of your cousin, whom you clearly dislike, but at the same time an early-2os woman can probably tell her own cousin to fuck off without too much issue.\n\nSo, it's a little weird that you had \"alarm bells\" going off--what does that even mean? There was nothing hidden about his agenda; he literally just thought she was hot (I guess), and said so, and that's not what \"alarm bells\" means.\n\nAll of which to say: I think you were looking for a reason to confirm your dislike, and you were a little too aggressive in taking it upon yourself to tell him to leave when he hadn't actually done anything. \n\nSo YTA, even if your heart was in the right place. The couple is right and you *didn't* \"have to get security\"; you *decided* to take that on yourself when plenty of other people were available to make that call and whatever advances Jonathan was gonna make weren't on a minor.", "Nta.

Everyone is staying or camping in the houses/trailers/tents. Day goes off wonderfully and we move to the reception. At the reception it\u2019s open bar, literal bathtub of canned beer/coolers and people are getting into the libations. Everyone is jolly and happy drunk with the understanding that we want you to imbibe but keep the vibes good and make sure it\u2019s fun and safe for everyone\u2026.\n\nEveryone, that is, except my husbands one troubled friend (sounds exactly like OP\u2019s cousin tbh). He gets belligerent wasted. He ends up finding the one black person there, a child of around 6-7 years old, and starts saying racist shit to him. What he didn\u2019t know is dad is white and was right beside him and hears it all.  He yelled at him but otherwise held back, then comes raging up to me to tell me my friend is being an asshole. I ask him to point out who it is and I\u2019m not surprised to see who it is. I tell my husband to handle it, he tells his biggest cousin and they remove him from the wedding. He cried on my in-laws couch for the rest of the night and disappeared before the sun came up. We\u2019ve never spoken to him again and I hope he is ashamed forever.

I think, having the experience of being in-the-know, that I would have preferred to not have to deal with that shit at all. I spent the rest of the night checking in with my new cousin and his child to make sure they were ok and having fun. I kept looking over my shoulder expecting mark the loser to wander his way back in.

There was ample opportunity to do so, since no offense had actually been committed other than creepy talk. She wasn\u2019t in imminent danger. There was time to take a breath and consider the best approach. OP\u2019s reaction feels knee-jerk, but I applaud him for not letting it slide.
