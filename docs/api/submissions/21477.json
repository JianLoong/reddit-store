I actually had someone do this at my wedding. While my wife and I were off taking some photos, a longtime friend I had invited decided to make some homophobic remarks in front of a gay family member. He was asked to keep them to himself, and instead repeated them. A couple of my other guests took it upon themselves to tell him to leave, which he did while only telling me that he was leaving and that so-and-so was \u201cbeing an asshole\u201d (he was, in fact, the asshole).\nI didn\u2019t find out why he left early until later, but I was (and am) thankful that my friends stood up for my family member when I was out of earshot.

Same to everyone here saying it's not your \"place\" (in the physical or metaphorical sense lol). Stopping sexual harassment from escalating is EVERYONE'S duty, idgaf. \"Well it's MY wedding not yours\" \"well it's MY house not yours\" \"well it's MY pub not yours\" all those excuses and obsession with protocol tell me is that you're the type of person who'd let that attitude slide.\n\nLeaving this link here.

And frequently people with certain types of disabilities will say things out loud that many people would not and might even flirt in such a way.  It is quite harmless and people who know him know this.  \n\nSo I actually feel bad for Jonathan because on its face, I do not know why he would behave in such a way and I would not assume he is a typical person and would give him latitude, spend more time with him, talk to his closer family, and try to understand more.  I might have intervened in a different way.  \n\nI think it is important for people to understand that not everyone is typical and the \"disappearing\" thing could be another clue.  When you look at this situation as if Jonathan is a typical person, the behavior looks different to you than a person with social issues related to a disability.  \n\nYou probably should have talked to the bride and groom if you didn't know Jonathan's full situation first.  Because if this had happened to me and my family, the bride and groom in my family would have been mortified and really upset that someone threw my son out.  Then again, I probably would have been there with him at the time.", "Soft YTA. NTA for intervening, you absolutely did the right thing there, but after that you should have tipped off the bridal party and let them decide how to handle it.

Asking if she was single does not constitute a threat. You could have approached Jessica and warned her that Jonathan was her cousin and to keep and eye out for him. Surrounded by family and friends I expect she could easily have kept him at bay if he became obnoxious. \n\nIt is not all that unusual that a man would be interested in a girl he didn't know was his cousin. That doesn't mean he would have acted on it once he had been told (other to admire her from a distance). Unless something happened that you haven't told us about, you had no right to kick Jonathan out.

You see something like that you tell the people whose party it is. It is not your obligation nor right to play bouncer at their wedding.", "NAH, as I see both sides. I don\u2019t think you were out of line for kicking him out given that you are part of the family, but I can see how the bride & groom got to their position as well. Some couples want to know everything that\u2019s going on, weirdly. It was a difficult call to make and you made the call you thought was best for everyone, and you\u2019re not an asshole for that. \n\nNeither are the groom & bride out of line for feeling a bit miffed, too, since whatever happened at their wedding will end up reflecting upon them and I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re a bit embarrassed about creepy cousin making a scene.

I suppose you could have gotten backup from a closer family member or bridal party member, but you were trying to handle it discretely and that means handling it simply & quietly.

It\u2019s just a ridiculous perspective of OP\u2019s cousin and his new wife to have. Yes it\u2019s their big day but they\u2019re also not puppet masters controlling all the strings.

If he\u2019s that weird the situation needs to be addressed quickly. I had something slipped into my drink once and was out in ten mins(my friends got me thank god).

Go away.\n\nI think the bride and groom has got too much of that \"it's our function, our call\" juice.", "Wait, did you invite a known homophobe and ask him to keep a lid on it, or did you ask your gay family member not to repeat homophobe\u2019s remarks?", "I\u2019ll play devils advocate. Should have gone to the bride or grooms family to handle. The way OP describes Jonathan he could easily be on the spectrum. Doesn\u2019t excuse his actions but best to let family deal with it. Also the bride and groom think OP over stepped. It\u2019s their wedding so in their mind OP over stepped. Internet strangers responses don\u2019t change the fact the people that count think OP was  out of line. I\u2019d apologize. OP did have to do something, just apologize for not giving them an opportunity to handle the situation.", "To make it worse he made his way to a bar near by as it was St. Patrick\u2019s day ( yes he came to the wedding I\u2019m a green flyer jacket) and a bunch of us ended up there after the reception. He through a bottle at the glass and shelves behind the bar shattering them and getting cops called. To avoid him being attested a friend of the groom offered to take him to his hotel. Dude didn\u2019t remember where it was so said friend let him crash and his brand new condo! Big shock, when he woke up in the morning the guy was gone and had peed and vomited all over his new bed and new carpet! Needless to say he was cut off from the friend group!", "Curious if the unexplained absence to no one knows was just a secret stint in jail somewhere....", "They didn\u2019t tolerate it though, the only thing they seem to be pissed about is that someone other than them kicked the creep out, but they confirmed to security that he should leave.", "Yeah, what the advances were and also what Jessica's response was, because OP doesn't say that she had a problem with it. If Jessica and Jonathan were mutually interested then it's not up to OP to interfere with a consensual adult hookup just because it's taboo in Western society and he personally thinks it's icky. Cousins are genetically not that much closer than the random population, there's no practical reason they shouldn't have a relationship. They are legally allowed to get married if they feel like it.", "This.", "No, you let the bride and groom have a nice day and don't bother them with issues like that.\n\nLimo got a flat? Sure.\n\nBut not creepy cousin being creepy.", "OP stated that he asked again if she is single directly after being told they are cousins AND started making advances toward her. Weird take btw", "That\u2019s what does it for me too. He was behaving like a predator. I can\u2019t speak for the cousin but I\u2019d be grateful. NTA.", "Neither\n\nJerk made homophobic comment at gay guest\n\nThird person said hey jerk keep that shit to yourself/keep your mouth shut it's not nice\n\nJerk said it again anyway\n\nThird person and a few others made the jerk leave\n\nJerk told the bride third person and others were being assholes on his way out\n\nBride had everything explained later and was thankful they handled it", "I took it as the person who made the remarks was admonished once by being told to keep those comments to yourself (perhaps by those who overheard). Instead he decided to repeat whatever homophobic thing again. That was when he was asked to leave. Just guessing though.", "But if things had gone their way, a sexual harasser would have had free reign to actually confront someone, make a move, etc for a lot longer. Even just 5 minutes more could have led to something much worse....Idk why they think that's okay. \n\nEvery moment can't be perfectly proper when safety is on the line, especially when you invite the weird cousin that was gone randomly for years.", "I said bridal party. Brides maids, grooms, hired security, parents of the bride and groom. Alert them and let them decide. Not you as a guest.\n\nYou should absolutely let the bride and groom have a nice day.", "That is pretty ambiguous wording, and drunks do tend to take offense easily. Op admits he was drunk. He may have created just as much disturbance as Jonathan.  Years of experience makes it possible to see how this scene could\u2019ve really played out.", "Yeah, they should have at least expected something like this from the creepy guy who just disappears and reappears on a whim."]}
