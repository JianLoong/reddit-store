You never got a speeding ticket?!?!??? She was not in the car with him. I would imagine he drives extra cautious with her in the car\n\nAlso, that\u2019s just more stress in your husband", "Almost everyone has driven 15 over the speed limit.  How's his driving in general?  Context of the ticket matters.", "YTA. Listen you can make any decision regarding your child\u2019s safety you want and I stand behind that 100%. But your husband is the only other option and you are throwing it all on him without discussing it with him.", "I'll start by saying you're the parents and it's your responsibility to keep your children safe. Buuuut I, also, believe there's a bit of helicopter parenting going on here. It was a speeding ticket, not a DUI or a road rage incident, and you child wasn't in the car.

You found out he got a ticket and assumed that he was deliberately endangering his niece? When he's been getting up early and driving her to school?

I never drive that extreme when there's other people in the car and NEVER when there's higher risk passengers like animals, children, elderly etc. \n\nYour mother is right. Most people speed. Google \"what percentage of drivers speed\" and you'll see this is not an abnormal occurrence. You should apologizing to your brother for making unfair assumptions about his character based on a single ticket and likely hurting his feelings. You had no proof he was putting Jessie in danger.

One day he was pulled over and ticketed for not keeping up with the flow! He probably could have won if he contested the ticket, but did not want to go through the hassle, so just paid.\n\nAnother example: I was driving on a highway and approaching a town driving 80 mph. I very carefully drove past a police car and was shocked when he  pulled me over. Apparently they had recently moved the reduced speed limit further out of town and I did not see the new sign saying 60 mph. \n\nMoral of the story: anyone can get ticketed once. You only have to worry if it is careless driving or repeated offences.\n\nIf your brother is normally a decent driver, I think you should give him another chance - if he is willing.\n\nMild YTA.", "Was Sarah in the car when Jacob got the ticket? No? Then, YTA. I am guessing he drives like a granny with his niece.\n\nPlus 15 over can be BAD (school zone, neighborhoods), but it can also happen ( keeping up with traffic, coming off a hill, or simply not realizing) 15 over 60mph is 75, which is about 7 mph slower than most people drive where I live.\n\nJacob did you a solid, and you called him unacceptable. You are lacking in goodness and grace.", "YTA don\u2019t ever bite the hand that feeds you other wise your going to be driving your daughter to school your own self or she\u2019s going to have to take the bus which happens to be things y\u2019all can\u2019t do no more", "I mean, personally I think you're an AH, but if you're within your rights to stop him from driving your kid to school if a speeding ticket on a highway at +15 is a dealbreaker for you.

I'm sure he would never willingly put your daughter in harms way.", "Is your brother a regular traffic offender, like is he in general a bad driver , cutting lanes, regularly overspeeding, driving rashly and has been fined multiple times ?\n\nIf the answer is NO, then probably YTA as it seems your bro is going out of his way to help you and your husband and all he gets an earful from you on a trivial traffic offence.\n\nI understand that you are concerned about your child's safety but then lashing out on your brother doesn't exactly seem helpful.", "You're not an AH for caring about your daughters safety.

Bigger question, 15 over in a 25 (so 40mph)? 35 (so 50 mph)? When you start talking about the ACTUAL mph, it\u2019s a lot. There is a lot of work that goes into posted speed limits. Taking into account road type, conditions, pedestrian/bike traffic, etc. yes, some speed limits may need to be raised as the area changes and developed, but there is a lot of work that goes into them.

Don\u2019t your highways have fast and slow lanes??  Bit weird if they don\u2019t", "Lol. Here you don\u2019t even need a cop to pull you up for speeding. A camera can be set up anywhere and you get sent a ticket in the mail. But then I\u2019m from a country that cares about its citizens. \n\nETA just because something is \u201cnormal\u201d does that mean it is right??", "Alberta?", "We\u2019re not talking about special circumstances such as construction area or a merge zone or a cop is beside you or bad weather, in normal driving conditions I\u2019ve never seen most drivers do the speed limit and I drive on highways daily and have been driving for 35 years lol. You sound confused.", "In the cities maybe. There's a lot of 40 km zones popping up in my local area which is normal in a school zone but annoyingly slow in less residential areas. I lived in the NT for a while. Stuart Highway meant no speed limit. \n\nNot being contrarian but just to add to your comment. \ud83d\ude01", "The thing is that you don't have to go blind or get severely vision impaired if you're on time with treating the condition. \nSo even though a large part of the population with diabetes does get retinopathy (I looked it up. It's 40% in my country) it doesn't have to lead to severe vision loss or blindness. And the same goes for the other eye conditions that you can get from diabetes. So to me the fact that she did get severe vision loss is a sign of a failing medical system. \n\nI must say I did learn stuff while looking this up, so thank you for that. If I ever get diabetes I'll be sure to get regular eye check-ups.", "I have seen a lot of people with diabetes in my career and many long-term and not well controlled. It is rare that someone has eye sight bad enough to lose their privilege to drive. Especially at 39 even with type 1 diabetes.", "How often are you getting caught speeding!?!", "All these people downvoting us because it\u2019s ok for them to break the law apparently lol. My late husband used to cut people out of car wrecks. Believe me most are caused by speed and usually not speeding by much. It seems like some of these people don\u2019t care about the lives they are putting in danger. It seems that because they do it, it must be ok.", "Speeding cameras are horrible. What country are you from?", "You may not be talking about those things now, but it's pretty convenient to claim that at this point. And nothing I said was confusing or suggests that I am. Feel free to use more ad hominems to try and make a point though.", "There was a bad year over a decade ago when I got pulled 3 times in the same year. All 3 were brought down. 2 speeding reduced to another charge as I mentioned earlier, and the last was technically reckless (at the time in my state \"reckless\" was over 80mph regardless of speed limit) but it reduced to speeding 14mph over limit. None of them went to court otherwise likely would have been dismissed or reduced further by judge/DA. \n\nBut that was a past life. Knock on wood, haven't been pulled over in the last 7-8 years luckily.", "Australia and the statistics show they have saved many lives so how can that be stupid. Is it stupid to keep people safe", "No but fuck speeding cameras.", "We also have red light cameras and cameras that can see if you are wearing a seatbelt or not or if you are using your mobile phone while driving.", "Red light cameras are ok, the seatbelt thing seems extreme, I  have never met anybody that doesn't wear one."]}
