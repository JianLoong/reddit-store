You never got a speeding ticket?!?!??? She was not in the car with him. I would imagine he drives extra cautious with her in the car\n\nAlso, that\u2019s just more stress in your husband", "Almost everyone has driven 15 over the speed limit.

I never drive that extreme when there's other people in the car and NEVER when there's higher risk passengers like animals, children, elderly etc. \n\nYour mother is right. Most people speed. Google \"what percentage of drivers speed\" and you'll see this is not an abnormal occurrence. You should apologizing to your brother for making unfair assumptions about his character based on a single ticket and likely hurting his feelings. You had no proof he was putting Jessie in danger.

I very carefully drove past a police car and was shocked when he  pulled me over. Apparently they had recently moved the reduced speed limit further out of town and I did not see the new sign saying 60 mph. \n\nMoral of the story: anyone can get ticketed once. You only have to worry if it is careless driving or repeated offences.\n\nIf your brother is normally a decent driver, I think you should give him another chance - if he is willing.\n\nMild YTA.", "Was Sarah in the car when Jacob got the ticket? No? Then, YTA. I am guessing he drives like a granny with his niece.\n\nPlus 15 over can be BAD (school zone, neighborhoods), but it can also happen ( keeping up with traffic, coming off a hill, or simply not realizing) 15 over 60mph is 75, which is about 7 mph slower than most people drive where I live.\n\nJacob did you a solid, and you called him unacceptable.

Bigger question, 15 over in a 25 (so 40mph)? 35 (so 50 mph)? When you start talking about the ACTUAL mph, it\u2019s a lot. There is a lot of work that goes into posted speed limits.

Then they say they\u2019re gonna give me a break and give me a ticked for going 80. \n\nSounds nice but it was still 5mph over what I was going. I had the cruise control set and was one of the slower vehicles on that part of the freeway.", "Chill tf out", "You are totally within your rights to make decisions for the safety of your child.  If you think he's not a safe enough driver to drive your child, that's the end of it.", "Please take note of your downvotes. 15 mph over the speed limit isn\u2019t viewed as particularly alarming by most of the US society - especially if he wasn\u2019t with your kid. \n\n80 mph in a 65 mph zone is pretty normal in many places and for many drivers.\n\nIt\u2019s rude and insulting to ban him over a completely unrelated ticket (outside of drunk driving). That said, you could\u2019ve used that to warn him not to do that when your kid is with him rather than banning him.\n\nThat said, just let your kid Uber with a stranger if you\u2019re concerned about speeding. That sounds way safer! /s, but still ok.", "I mean I think so? My car odometer  says 220", "She stated in an earlier comment that it was on a highway, those are typically 55 or over", "I've driven in some pretty high stress traffic situations in my life (eg metro NY City) and I'm always impressed how fast Canadians blast al ong in southern Ontario. It's great, bc usually I'm just passing thru, so it shrinks the transit time.", "I've known that for over 50 years, but I'm spelling it out for the non Canadians in the audience.\n\nNot everyone has had the experience of driving over the Welland Canal at light speed.", "I have never heard it called QEW.  QE2 or just hwy 2 is the shorthand phrase I've heard growing up.", "Regional is irrelevant. The danger is when you are going 10mph over or under the flow of traffic, whatever the flow of traffic is, regardless of what the actual speed limit is.", "Where did I say that everyone is going the speed limit? Oh right. I didn't.", "That too! \n\nNot even mentioning said child wasn\u2019t even in the damn car \ud83d\ude2d", "That's pretty judgmental. Sometimes diabetes is unmanageable. Also, while maintaining good control of your blood glucose levels can reduce the risk of eye damage, retinal damage is also related to the length of time you have had diabetes. After 15 years of having diabetes, 98 percent of those with type 1 diabetes and 78 percent of those with type 2 have some degree of retinal damage. While fewer than 5% suffer severe vision loss, diabetic retinopathy is still the leading cause of blindness in people between the ages of 20 and 60.", "I thought this too.  At age 39 how do you  even get to the stage where your diabetes is that poorly managed that you are losing your sight?\n\nMy mum is 66 and has had type 1 diabetes for 55years. Over the last 10 years it has become harder for her to control and she has had to have laser surgery on her eyes for the last 2 years. However even her sight is still ok enough for her to be able to drive\n\nOP how is your child getting to school now that you won\u2019t let your brother take her?", "Same. Where I am from the left hand lane on the highway is basically NASCAR tryouts. \n\nOP, the decision is yours, it is your kid, however I don't see how your kid is getting to school. Also, why doesn't your district provide an aide for your child on the bus? They should be legally required to if your child needs it.", "I feel like keeping a 5-6 second following distance and keeping with the flow of traffic is more important for safety than going the exact speed limit. In fact, I've been in plenty of situations where I feel it is safer to go over the speed limit than to be that much slower than the rest of traffic.\n\nIt sounds like your decline in eyesight was gradual, is it possible you're associating your negative driving experience with this event?\n\nI get it, she's your baby but I think it was probably worth having a conversation with your brother about why it makes you nervous rather than immediately shutting him out. That would make me feel untrusted and like my sibling didn't even respect me enough to talk to me about it", "No they don\u2019t. In some cases they openly admit they estimated your speed. And the DA is not involved at all in the vast majority of the cases.", "And thank you so much for not participating in THE REDDIT INSANITY that everyone all over the globe has the slightest idea what their acronyms and abbreviations mean. SPELL IT OUT! It doesn't take that much longer, and not everyone in the world was born in your neighborhood...", "I appreciate you spelling it out, lol. If you had said QE or QEW, most non-Canadians (me) would be like, \"Wtf are you talking about?\" Lol Thanks!", "That's my point, some places the flow of traffic is 15mph over the speed limit and others it might be the speed limit", "> on the highway when everyone else is going the limit", "Not sure where OP is, but most transportation districts where I am are severely understaffed and literally can't provide a 1-1 aide.   \n\n\nSay OP's district is in the same boat and the district needs 200 drivers, well in this situation? they'll only have half of that at best.", "Don't the majority tickets come from radar instead of cops estimates?", "But the comment I was responding to was suggesting \"it was only 15mph\" as if that is the mitigating factor. 15 mph over in a school zone would be dangerous regardless of traffic flow. 15 mph on the highway is only dangerous if you are going 10mph faster than the flow of traffic. If the traffic normally is 80mph, but the limit is 65, going with the flow wouldn't be dangerous, but if the flow slowed to 65mph for any reason, continuing at 80 would become increasingly dangerous as the rest of the traffic slowed.", ">or even 5 miles over the limit\n\nIf you're going to quote something, quote the whole thing. The context there is key. I was making a point about the 10mph difference, not suggesting that people drive at exactly the limit. It was a hypothetical. \n\nThe same would be true if a person was doing 60 and the flow of traffic was 70-75 in a 65mph area. The person going 60 would be the hazard. This is also true when people are in a 65 and driving at 50 due to traffic and some idiot is driving at 40 or 60. \n\nGoing 10 mph over or under the flow of traffic is the problem, not the actual speed of the flow of traffic or the speed limit.", "Drivers and aides do not have the same qualifications. But yes I do understand that most districts are understaffed.", "Not where I\u2019ve lived.
