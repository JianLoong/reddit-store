But you need a new husband because the one you have is TAH.", "I salute you. Would have done the same thing.", "NTA", "NTA but you have a MUCH bigger problem than Christmas gifts here. First of all, parenting should be a team effort. His instituting punishments without consulting you is definitely out of line. Also, I am suspicious about his definition of \"misbehaving\" and his decision to punish the kids. What can they have done that is so bad? And what led to your daughter swearing at him? And one more thing: He returned the gifts?  Where is the money? Is he having financial problems he is also not discussing with you?", "NTA.  Him calling anyone else childish is laughable.

Store them away in a safe hidden place preferably outside of the home. I mean it\u2019s kinda ridiculous that you are married to a person who is a blatant thief and sees nothing wrong with what he\u2019s doing. NTA for now but you should really think this entire situation over. He used the gifts as a way to punish your children and control them. Then he took a gift you purchased for your child and stole it. You used his gift to make up for the one he stole from your daughter and he decided to throw a tantrum and get his family to harass you. Is this the type of person you want to be with?", "NTA! He went running and crying to his family that you took away his PS5 \ud83d\ude02. Are you dating a teenager? \n\nSeriously though, he stole from you by refusing to give you the money from the return. And it\u2019s clear you guys don\u2019t agree on how to discipline the kids, and that gets more dicey when you have a blended family.

Please tell me this a joke.", "NTA but he\u2019s calling you childish when he\u2019s the one tattling on you to his family???", "No, your not. He is a huge asshole, and maybe has some deeper problems. If he didn't pay for the gift, he should have either talked with you about it, or gave you the money back.\n\nSounds like he is just a dick with control problems. You did the right thing in my book.", "NTA", "NTA. If my SO did this I would seriously consider leaving them. Effective punishments/consequences are directly related to the issue at hand. Not only is this form of punishment ineffective and stupid, it's psychologically abusive to the kids, and financially abusive to you (at a minimum). I would insist your partner take some type of parenting class, unless you are happy for your kids to go LC or NC when they're older.", "NTA but you will be if you don't divorce someone who is literally stealing from you and your child. You returned his gift for your own money, but he still stole the money from her gift. Dump him and fast, before he does something else super controlling that is hard to escape. He showed you who he is, believe him.", "NTA why is your husband taking gifts away from kids and even you and keeping the money? Total jerk move. I\u2019m more concerned at how is it that your kids can cuss at him? What is really going on at that household???", "So he refused to give you your own money? And why did she swear at him did you ask her that? Nothing but Red Flags", "NTA and please see this for the huge red flag that it is.", "Your husband is failing at parenting here.", "nta. although i feel that part of the problem is your husband wanting presents as well. i would go out and get him a nice present (like divorce papers) and give it to him!", "Tell him to buy himself a new one with the money he stole from you.", "NTA Removing children\u2019s presents from under a Christmas tree is cruel.

There\u2019s so much poor parenting going on here.  He\u2019s a control freak and mean.  The kids are going to grow up hating him and resenting you for allowing it.

NTA for what you did but honestly letting your husband treat your children that way makes you a little bit of an ah.", "NTA and you husband is on a power trip. Why are you with him? You can tell him if he keeps it up, his kids will hate him when they are older. Any thoughts of walking daughter down the aisle or meeting grandchildren can be kissed goodbye too.", "NTA. Your husband is abusive and his behavior is going to affect both kids for the rest of their childhoods and beyond.", "NTA. Wow, the fact he started taking away his presents instead of addressing the problem is the first issue. Then when his presents weren't enough he took away yours, not for a short lesson, but actually took it back and then kept the money is theft and shows an immaturity that should be over by the time you're 30. \nAnd as far as him saying he wants his present, he got a present. The stolen money from your daughters gift. \nI would think seriously about being with a person that steals gifts from children and then has his family harass you over his gift.", "NTA Taking kids presents is peak AH behavior already but taking and returning a present he didn\u2019t buy and keeping the money when confronted is, wow, that\u2019s top 1% AH behavior. Add on shamelessly complaining to his family about it and getting them to bully you and I am wondering if this is a real person, like do people this blazingly awful really exist and, whoa, why are you married to the top unicorn of AHs? Is he green? Does he live in a cave above town with his small abused dog? Does he hate Christmas?

Please leave this man. Take your daughter and leave.  He\u2019s not someone you want to raise your child.  Who does this with Christmas gifts. Geez; sounds like a hateful man.  Oh and NTA!!

Your husband is.\nI read your post to my older son and husband.  \n\nYour private funds, you get the money back. If it was household money, then it goes back to the household account.  Your husband stole from you.\n\nGet your family to spam him for what he did without discussing with your wife first. Since the daughter swore, why didn't he tell you?\n\nMy husband was aghast.

Good on you for taking away his stuff and seeing how he likes it.", "You really need to rethink your relationship because wow oh wow", "Oh hell no, that would not fly with me. That is not co-parenting, consequences should be discussed and agreed on by both parents.

So many red flags here!", "NTA \nFirst of all he should not have any say regarding your daughter with out discussing it with you first as he is not her parent you are(not sure if her father is in the picture or not) \nSecond he should have informed you of her swearing at him and why she did that kids don\u2019t just swear for no reason\nThird that present was something you worked hard for and he had no right to return something he did not purchase especially to deny you of your money back \nI\u2019m glad you got rid of his present that he does not deserve for being so cruel and controlling to innocent children. Your husband going out of his way to punish innocent children for misbehaving and then to go to his family to complain about you making you out to look like the bad one is not only childish but he is gaslighting you for his actions.

He sounds childish and he is a thief. That was your money, and your present for your daughter. He stole the present without asking you, stole your money and got upset that his actions got consequences. And his family callong you, that is another level of child-like behavior.

I'm astonished he think it's acceptable to outright bully the kids like this while simultaneously getting upset at the same being done to him; an adult who actually earns cash.\n\nPerhaps on a more serious note... You not buying the presents is not a valid reason to not have a say/speak up. It's this kind of overreaction that creates traumatic memories that stay with kids forever. As a parent, you need to be your children's biggest advocate as they cannot advocate for themselves. Idk whether he is incredibly misguided or just downright cruel, but do not back down. As a parent, this is a hill you need to die on.", "NTA! Taking away their presents permanently is an extreme punishment that does not befit anything an 8 or 6year old could have done!

Don\u2019t take anything his family say to heart, they\u2019re either the reason he thinks this is an appropriate way to treat young children or have been told an untrue version of events.\n\nI think you need to do some serious thinking. Stuff like this can leave some serious emotional scars on young children. Don\u2019t let their childhood memories be of their father/stepfather being such an ass and their mother/stepmother seemingly enabling him!
