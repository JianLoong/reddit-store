You are a monster for denying him become he's a man.  And men have needs. He's so nice to you and loves you so much. How could you dare not love everything he does?\" Everyone around me was tainted by him.  If I'd had reddit back then I'd have totally posted here all the time.  \ud83d\ude05", "I would suggets watching movie \"Enough\" starring Jennifer Lopez. It does a really good job of showing how any woman can get into this situation. The end is pretty unrealistic, just a heads up, but the beginning half of the movie does a very good job. It will help add visual context for the previous comment.", "Unfortunately it is because many persons who have abusive tendencies can hide behind the mask of being a good person until it is too late. Then there are other abusers who are so subtle that the victim does not realize they are being abused until it is too late.\n\nAs a survivor of childhood abuse I swore to myself that when I grew up I would never allow myself to be abused again. I then proceeded to make the mistake of marrying an abuser at a young age. It took me 4-1/2 years before I got divorced. \n\nA few months after my divorce while thinking I had learned my lesson Imet then started dating an \"older, more mature & charismatic\" man who convinced me he would never hurt a woman. I was still young & niave enough to fall for it because in the beginning he treated me so much better than any one else ever had. The only good thing I can say about my 2nd husband is that he was never physically violent. That mistake cost me another 11 years of my life before ending up divorced again. \n\nMy 3rd serious relationship never made it to marriage {he did propose fairly early on but I didn't accept}. He turned out to be a serial cheater. We were on/off for 12 years. In my defense even though he made a crappy partner for a serious relationship he was very very talented in the bedroom. \n\nMy 4th (& most likely) final serious relationship of almost 5 years has been finished for over 1 year now. He turned out to be a lazy slob who had no interest in fixing his issues. Luckily I wised up to what was going on & canceled the wedding to him.\n\nI am now throughly opposed to marriage for myself. Occasionally I do get lonely but it is not worth the risk for me. Maybe someday I might find someone who is right for me or maybe I won't. For the time being I am not even trying because I believe that my relationship \"picker\" has a massive default. Instead I am committed to therapy & working on myself for now.", "Some people love power. They can use that power to be the big hero, to be the romantic, to make someone feel special. They can also flip it, and make someone feel small, be a bully, show that they are unmoved by sympathy for others.", "Cuz where else would we get assholes?!?", "because these are all fake.", "I'm so with you. Decisions about the family should be family decisions. Instead 'he bought', ' my daughter' and 'his son' presents. You've been married since the kids were 5 and 3. If they aren't both your kids and his kids, then dont get married. The trauma these kids must feel!

I hope it's not the case with OP's partner, but something to look out for.", "The little girl is probably tired of his shit.", "She was allowing it to happen under the guise of \"well he bought the gifts so I don't get a say.\" No OP, you're mom to at least one of those kids, arguably both.

It should be tight for him. This is wrong on so many levels.", "Not the person you initially responded to but I kind of get their point. OP is not juvenile because of the story we get here, but you can infer some things from the context provided. \n\nReturning the PS5 and buying a new switch is absolutely not juvenile and was the right thing to do for her kid.\n\nOn the other hand, jumping into a marriage with someone who clearly has major personality issues  is. The OP mentioned they have been with their husband 3 years. That probably means he proposed after 2, maybe even less time. Seems kind of irresponsible to get married that quickly when you have a 5-7 year old child you need to look out for.
