My friend and I have been buddies for years and his sister and my sisters are also friends.\n\n\nWe also allowed his girlfriend to come with us, even though she was originally not invited. His girlfriend, who I\u2019ll name Eva, and me aren\u2019t on good terms. This is because we used to be in a short relationship awhile ago, but I broke up with her because of her controlling behavior. \n\n\nSo it was a bit awkward when my friend started dating her, but I was fine with it. It seems Eva never forgave me though.\n\n\nA bit of background info is necessary here. My bio father left my mom and me when I was 3 and never returned. My mom eventually remarried and had my sisters, who are in fact my half-sisters, even though we never call each other as such and because it is obvious. \n\n\nMy mom and I are white and my stepdad is black. So my sisters are biracial. I have a very good relationship with my stepdad but don\u2019t really see him as a father figure. \n\n\nThis all started when Eva and my eldest sister (I\u2019ll call her Shanice) were arguing over were to go on one of our outings during the week. Really minor stuff. Eva was upset that it wasn\u2019t going how she wanted it to. Not to mention she never really liked my sisters.\n\n\nOut of nowhere Eva called Shanice a \u201cfat n-word bitch\u201d (hard R). I was speechless. Eva wouldn\u2019t apologise and doubled down. Many more offensive things were said. \n\n\nAfterwards we decided (everyone minus my friend and Eva) that Eva would be kicked off the trip. Both my sisters weren\u2019t really comfortable around her anymore. \nWe told my friend and Eva and she got really angry, my friend understood but was angry at Eva considering everything was paid and they aren\u2019t getting their money back. Eva demanded their money back but I told her no can do. \n\n\nShe called me an asshole. \n\n\nYesterday I was talking with some friends and they told me I should at least try to get their money back, considering it was quite a lot. I told them no way. Some thought it was a bit asshole-ish. However, I am done with Eva.\n\nETA: The vacation reservation is in my name. It would be a week to Europe. The vacation is already paid. However, plane tickets and hotel tickets are still in their name. They could still go on their own, but we wouldn\u2019t go as a group. Because we would run into each other and because my friend wanted to go as a group, he didn\u2019t want to go anymore.", "created_utc": 1689294491, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14z1axh/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_and_his_gf_off_our/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Eva obviously. You for one, thinking you are even allowed to kick someone from a vacation and two, for not returning their portion of any joint activities or places to stay.
