His girlfriend, who I\u2019ll name Eva, and me aren\u2019t on good terms. This is because we used to be in a short relationship awhile ago, but I broke up with her because of her controlling behavior. \n\n\nSo it was a bit awkward when my friend started dating her, but I was fine with it. It seems Eva never forgave me though.\n\n\nA bit of background info is necessary here. My bio father left my mom and me when I was 3 and never returned. My mom eventually remarried and had my sisters, who are in fact my half-sisters, even though we never call each other as such and because it is obvious. \n\n\nMy mom and I are white and my stepdad is black. So my sisters are biracial. I have a very good relationship with my stepdad but don\u2019t really see him as a father figure. \n\n\nThis all started when Eva and my eldest sister (I\u2019ll call her Shanice) were arguing over were to go on one of our outings during the week.

Many more offensive things were said. \n\n\nAfterwards we decided (everyone minus my friend and Eva) that Eva would be kicked off the trip. Both my sisters weren\u2019t really comfortable around her anymore. \nWe told my friend and Eva and she got really angry, my friend understood but was angry at Eva considering everything was paid and they aren\u2019t getting their money back. Eva demanded their money back but I told her no can do. \n\n\nShe called me an asshole. \n\n\nYesterday I was talking with some friends and they told me I should at least try to get their money back, considering it was quite a lot. I told them no way. Some thought it was a bit asshole-ish. However, I am done with Eva.\n\nETA: The vacation reservation is in my name. It would be a week to Europe. The vacation is already paid. However, plane tickets and hotel tickets are still in their name. They could still go on their own, but we wouldn\u2019t go as a group.

Because we would run into each other and because my friend wanted to go as a group, he didn\u2019t want to go anymore.\n\nI was on the verge bc of the money. But this makes it obvious. You kicked them out of your group, but they still can go on their own. So NTA beyond reasonable doubts", "NTA she needs to learn a lesson.", "Ah, the joys of not paying for refundable tickets, reservations, or trip insurance.\n\nIf they don't go, it's entirely up to them to work on getting any sums reimbursed. Op does need to be somewhat careful that if they're canceling their room, it's not all the rooms being cancelled.", "but he didn't, he is still with Eva, not cool", "Agreed. It\u2019s showing OP what his values are. I could never date a racist or misogynist. My values are respecting loving organisms and I would never accept being with someone like that.  Sticking w a person like that means you\u2019re cool with it.", "they all agreed to give her the boot. having a little compassion of the cost is hardly sus regardless of whether she deserves it or not.", "She's already ruined their holiday, and on her way to sever his friendship ties. I doubt it will get better from here, but if that's what he wants.... a racist gf and no friends.", "Why should he pay it back nahhhh", "Lmao violent racists don't deserve refunds", "Racist behavior or not she can piss off, she's jot welcome, who cares about her racist ass money, she doesn't deserve anything from op for being a jagoff to their sister", "I hate that saying. The best weapons against discrimination/racism is respect, empathy, and education. If you shun one Nazi your still going to have one Nazi in the world. If you sit down have a respectful and educational discussion. You might have one less Nazi in the world by conversations end. But that can never happen if the simple act of sitting at a table with one gets you condemned too.", "I suspect he won't be for long thou.\n\nOP I would put your 'friend' in a time out/no contact as he is condoning racism, while he stays with her.   And that is not someone you should want around your family.", "i will NEVER understand anyone who willingly dates someone who has shown how racist they are.\n\nI immediately cut ties with racists, friends, so's, family members.", "This. The most reasonable response would be to dump her right there and then continue the trip. At most I would help her move up the return flight", "To be fair, op stated she\u2019s controlling. His friend might need time to properly extricate themselves depending on how much damage she\u2019s done.", "Quick google search says \"The average human punch generates around 120-150 psi or 360-450 pounds of force in total\"", "360-450 pounds of force give or take \n\nYes I did Google that.", "Only 30lbs?", "The only time violence is justifiable is for self-defense. Words (even racism and other vitriol) are never good enough reasons for violence unless those words cause people to feel unsafe and threatened (no, being uncomfortable doesn't count).\n\n\nNot to mention, if you could just punch anyone you labeled a Nazi or racist, then that opens up many more avenues of violence and makes the world a worse place. You'd so make it much easier to shut-down discussion around any sensitive topics and make people afraid to talk which leads to less solutions. In the worst case, people get slandered with labels and lies all the time, so now you'd be justifying your violence wrongly.\n\n\nDon't punch Nazis. Prove them wrong, don't hurt minds, change them.", "It might be more a legal issue they're worried about, or dealing with more of that ignorant drama.", "It might be more of a \"I don't agree with what she said, but I still think you should give her her money back since she's not going on the trip anymore.\"", "This was the first thing that sprang into my mind! Love it.", "so let me get this straight: you got *yourself* kicked off a trip because you made everyone else uncomfortable, and now we have to open our wallets to pay you back for what you did? We have to pay you for the pleasure of you experiencing the consequences of your own actions? We have to make you whole for your mistake? With cold hard worked for cash, lol no. Regardless of the raging racism, that wasn't going to fly. The racism just makes her even less sympathetic. In this case, the  'compassion' is def sus lmao", "Wait, wait a minute. If their tickets are in their name and they're able to go on their own, why do they need you to get their money back?", "Please make sure you can't get into legal trouble for accepting money for plane tickets from her, but not giving her the plane ticket that's on her name. This is the only reason why you should consider returning her her money. Just to make sure you are safe.", "What is the \"vacation reservation\" if not the flights and hotels? What, exactly, is in your name that you are unwilling to refund? And how much is it?\n\nGiven what happened, you're obviously NTA (which means this isn't really an ethical conundrum, but rather a rant). \n\nHowever, you are probably not legally entitled to withhold whatever services they paid for. To avoid a lawsuit, I'd try to return anything that's refundable, or resell it to someone else and return their money. No court is going to let you just pocket their cash.", "That\u2019s not the intent of the saying. You\u2019ve misunderstood the context and history. \n\n\u201cSitting at the table\u201d is a metaphor for working together with someone. \n\nIt means that if you have ten people not challenging the Nazi then they are implicitly supporting the Nazi.\n\nIt\u2019s like men not calling out sexist behaviour in other men.\n\nThe saying came from the historical shame of Germans in not speaking up against Nazis.\n\nThe point potentially applies to the boyfriend. If he is saying/doing nothing about the girlfriend\u2019s racism then he\u2019s condoning it.", "How morally virtuous of you and your tall horse.", "Eva sounds like she's got an absolute gripper down there", "They say don't stick your dick in crazy though, he gotta hit it and quit it before the condom breaks", "The existence of Nazis is a literal threat to the existence of numerous people.

I'm definitely lean to the not.

Even if said human beings are complete garbage.", "ummm read it again", "I think he paid for the activity part under his name, so nothing owed to them legally. And they could get refunds on the stuff in their name.", "Not dating someone who is openly racist is hardly high-horse moral behavior, though? It's like basic decency as well as common sense - their prejudice and a lack of empathy is going impact everyone they have a relationship with, subtly or not, not just members of the race they've decided to openly target.", "Can you provide examples of recent Nazis making people dead? If you can, then I'm all for those Nazis facing justice. \n\n\nBut the \"literal existence\" of a Nazi is not a threat to other people. If someone keeps that view entirely to themselves and simply never associated with anyone of another race because they believe they are superior, they're a Nazi but they are not a threat. Ideas don't warrant violence.\n\nIdeas can be dangerous, I'm not arguing that. But you have to use your own words and ideas to help other people be safe.", "Eva paid money to OP, reservation is on her name, OP witholds her tickets... What did I miss?", "LOL"]}
