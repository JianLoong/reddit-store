{"id": 30275, "submission_id": "17nbmtt", "title": "AITA for wanting to kick our friends and their newborn baby out of our house?", "selftext": "My husband(23M) and I(23F), just bought our first home together in April of this year where we live with our two dogs and our toddler who is almost 2. In June, we had discussed the possibility of letting our friends, we\u2019ll call them Seth(25M) and Lisa(26F) also married, stay with us for a little while (rent free) so that they can get on their feet and save up some money. I agreed, and we let them know.\n\nNot long after that, they told us they were pregnant. Shockingly, considering she has PCOS and a double uterus, being told it would be extremely difficult for her to conceive. This was a blindside for us, but we decided we would still let them stay up to a year if needed. \n\nThey moved into our house in July. Since then things have gone off the rails. Seth had quit his job when they moved and still currently doesn\u2019t have one. He spends all day every day on his computer playing video games and smoking pot. Lisa works from home making phone calls. On top of this, neither of them ever do any housework. Basic cleaning, taking out the trash, unloading the dishwasher, nothing. They also take our food without asking and use other items as well  and never replace items that they\u2019ve used. They have made themselves extremely comfortable at our expense. Lisa has also complained about our dogs barking and our toddler being \u201ctoo loud\u201d while she\u2019s taking phone calls for her job. \n\nThey also have 8 cats. I told them that the cats cannot come into our house because I am allergic and the dogs wouldn\u2019t get along with them. They purchased a small building and got it put in our backyard for the cats to stay in. This building has electricity and supplies heating and cooling for the cats. Not necessarily an issue, just something to consider.\n\nShe also hasn\u2019t had any prenatal care. She used the excuse of not having insurance, but even after she got insurance she still hasn\u2019t made a point to get checked out. She\u2019s visited the ER once because she was having pain, but that\u2019s it. She\u2019s had multiple 3D/4D scans done for fun, but nothing medical. I\u2019ve also seen her smoke weed on one occasion while being pregnant.\n\nLisa is also a very negative person. She complains about my husband not being finished with the attic because she needs somewhere to put her things so she can get them out of the nursery. She complains that our floor isn\u2019t level. She complains that yard work isn\u2019t done. All while she and Seth are doing nothing about it either. \n\nTwo nights ago Seth and Lisa went to the ER again because Lisa was having pains. She was diagnosed with preeclampsia and admitted to the hospital. They\u2019re currently in the hospital and are going to have their baby in the next couple days. I feel like I\u2019m at my breaking point and can\u2019t handle the weeks to come. My husband feels the same, but doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize his friendship with Seth. Them being here is taking a serious toll on my mental health and my relationship with my husband. So, am I the asshole?\n\n*edit to add that her assumed due date was December 9, so they\u2019re having the baby a month earlier than expected ", "created_utc": 1699064357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nbmtt/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_our_friends_and_their/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is the reason for them even moving in with you? They must've clearly had their own place if they had 8 bloody cats?\n\n2. You literally sound like you didn't know them before they moved in? The 8 cats Never got taken into consideration when you were discussing moving in?\n\n3. The fact that they contribute nothing to your overall household when knowing that they were moving in just sounds like you literally had no idea what they were like personally? And the fact that you're letting them move in? Must mean you're pretty close friends, yet you're surprised at all this\n? You've never been to their place in the entire time you've known them or something?\n\nIf this story is actually genuine then you are both the AH, them for being what you have explained and especially you and your husband for literally not doing your due diligence before letting people who you clearly don't know well enough at all move into your home?", "They moved in, in July, when Lisa was already 3-4 months pregnant. Seth quit his job and didn't start job hunting for a new one. They contributed nothing meaningful to the house, and it's only now, that Lisa has gone into hospital that you're at your breaking point?\n\nThe lack of jobs, gaming and being high all day, not contributing to the household etc should have been raised as a problem in August! ESH.\n\n\"Begin as you mean to continue\" is an important adage. If you needed them to contribute more than they were after the first couple of weeks settling in, you should have started raising that then. This has been an important life lesson if you ever agree to take in strays again in the future, tell them upfront what you expect of them. You expect them to find and maintain jobs, you expect them to contribute to x% of the bills. You expect them to do their fair share of housework etc.\n\nMeanwhile, you can still have that conversation. Not with Lisa, obviously, while she's in hospital but with Seth.\n\n\"Seth, when we invited you to move in with us, we were hoping that it would be an opportunity for you to save up some money and get on your feet. This isn't working out for us financially. We understand we would be utter AHs if we were to kick you out the moment Lisa comes back with your newborn, but we do need to discuss changes in how this is working so we don't come to that. We need you to start pulling your weight around here. Until you get a job, your job is to do all the housework and yard work. You also need to start paying for 30% of all the utilities. When you get a job we will discuss how to more equitably share the housework and yard work. We cannot continue to host you, Lisa, your baby and your cats without you contributing both financially and to the household.\"", "NTA, why is your husband so concerned about his friendship with a deadbeat?", "I have never been so reluctant to say ESH. They are raging aholes. They absolutely deserve to be kicked out. It is *undeniable* that they are taking ruthless advantage of your family.  Yet something in me refuses to agree with even the *thought* of kicking them out (or starting the eviction process, if they refuse to leave on their own) while their in the hospital having a baby. So, with great reluctance, you are also an ahole, but your mentality is easily understandable. \n\nAlso have to give your husband an ahole rating of his own for still being concerned about this toxic friendship. A one-sided price like this is too high to be concerned about straining the friendship.", "There's a lot to unpack, and I'm pretty sure others will discuss the bigger points. Here's mine: If your husband's reluctance to lose Seth's friendship is the only thing stopping you from asking them to leave, I have some thoughts. Your husband values Seth's friendship, but does Seth value your husband's friendship? He doesn't look like he does: he's squatting in your house, content to play games, while everyone else works around him.  \n\n\nOP: you're NTA for wanting the life you had before to be returned to you.", "What were you thinking? Eight cats, oh hell no!", "OP this is what you signed up for and this is your responsibility to remove this problem from your house.  The freeloaders, the cats, and the welcome mat from any potential future guests.  They saw a golden opportunity and took advantage of it and since it's November and you've still not said anything to them about kicking them out for not changing their ways, why in the world would they change?  I mean the bf actually quit his job without any repercussions.  You and your husband worked together to build a life for your family and you need to work together to take that life back.  They'll find somewhere else to lay their heads down and someone else to put them up for free - just not in your house as long as you choose not to put up with it no more.  The sooner you learn to say no early in life the easier it gets.", "NTA\n\nThis is a horrible situation, honestly you and your husband should have never agreed to let them live there rent free without a definite move out date, it's a setup for disaster if people decide to take advantage. The whole thing sounds like a circus, Lisa working from home on the phone and complaining about noise from your toddler and dogs. It's your new house, your toddler and your dogs should be able to be as they are, also, I've had toddlers and a dog and there's basically no way to stop noise. It must make you all very stressed out. Seth being extremely useless playing video games and smoking pot and not helping at all with the household chores is inexcusable since he's home all day/unemployed. Not to mention 8 cats and using up your food and supplies. It's a bad situation and about to get worse probably since she's going to have a preemie and you can't exactly kick them out right now but somehow you have to decide on a move out date. Seth needs to get a job pronto.", "NTA\n\nYour husband doesn't care about you.", "NTA It's clear that they took advantage of your generosity and were terrible guests. You have to put your family and your peace of mind first.\n\nThey had almost a year to prepare and save for the arrival of their baby, so they should have money for their own place.\n\nWhat's wrong with your husband? Why is he wants to keep these awful people in his life?", "Where is the \"friendship\" with Seth if all he does is loaf,  do no house/yard work,, and pays for nothing?", "YTA for waiting until the baby's on the way. You had *months* to confront them about their behavior and say \"if you don't change x and y by [date], you will need to move out by [month after that date].\"  Now that the baby's here, you're gonna have to give them some more leeway and time to prepare to move if you don't want to be the biggest AH ever. Instead of kicking them out, set a move-out date (ideally at least two months from now, hopefully longer, since job and apartment searching and everything are much more difficult with a newborn), make it clear they will need to leave on that date no matter what, and remind them every week or two if it seems like they're not making progress.", "NTA. It's obvious they are using you both and have no intentions of getting their act together, especially with a baby on the way. They seem to be relying on the fact that you are friends and probably know you both don't want to ruin the friendship. On top of that, eight cats is just ridiculous, seriously WTF. With all that complaining and having the audacity to not even do anything around the house to begin with, I would have gotten rid of them a long time ago. Maybe that's a bit harsh, but your mental health is way more important than dealing with people who are abusing your kindness.", "Why in the hell have you put up with this for so long? There is friendship and there is taking advantage also known here as taking the piss.  \n\nGood luck getting them out because it sounds like they will use every available trick in the book to stay. Grow a shiny spine and start eviction.  You cannot be the only people on the planet these two moochers know.", "ESH. Your \"friends\" are terrible, but you have enabled them every step of the way.  Not just your husband, but you. I don't know why you're here asking if you're cool to kick a newborn baby to the curb as if you could do such a thing when you're not even capable of saying \"you need to do some dishes\" or \"that's a firm no on the 8 cats.\"\n\nStart looking for a new job out of state and find a good realtor, because my prediction is that you and your family will move out before them.", "I stopped at 8 cats.  You might not be an asshole but you\u2019re definitely a dumbass for letting them stay with nothing in writing.  All because you probably hate any kind of conflict and expect things to either work perfectly or resolve themselves if you ignore it up to the boiling point.  Hopefully you update this post\u2026.", "NTA. \n\nI would ask them to move out as soon as you realistically can. I bet this situation will drag on for a very long time otherwise.", "You are very justified in wanting them to leave, but your timing is not good. She got diagnosed with a potentially fatal pregnancy complication and they are about to have a preemie. There is a high probability that the baby will be in the NICU for a while. It would be horrible of you to kick them out right now. You need to at least give them some warning. You've also got to think about legalities. They have established residency at your home so they are essentially your tenants. It's likely you will have to legally evict them, which also includes a notice period. I hate to say it but YTA. You should have done this long before it got to this point.", "ESH. Their behavior is way out of line and needs to be dealt with, but right now is not the time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good Luck getting them out of your house.", "Info: do they seriously have no family they can go to?\n\nThis isn't your job or responsibility, and they are abusing the situation.", "NTA.  Kick them out.  Personally I wouldn't let them back in the house.  I'd give the cats to a no kill shelter and put their stuff in it.  I'd give them 30 days to collect.  Then pay for a storage unit for 30 days and give them the info so they can pick up their belongings or not.  If you're feeling particularly generous you can find low income housing and shelters for them.  That's assuming they can't stay with family or other friends.  Anyone complaining gets told they just signed up to house them and you'll pass along their information.  Please note I don't know about the legalities and am only saying what I'd do. \n\nI'll point out my situation wouldn't be the same as the one about.  Because I would have insisted on a written agreement spelling out their costs and responsibilities along with what I and my husband would be responsible for.  I'd also have a month to month lease, even if there's no or little rent paid.  The lease still protects you if you have to evict.  And if you had that I'd be saying start the eviction process.  You didn't which is why I'd not allow them back in.  (Yes YWBTA to outsiders because of the baby.  The real assholes are your friends though.  I'd rethink the friendship.)", "FYI: If you think things are hard now, just wait til they come back home with the baby. It\u2019s sad that your husband cares more about his friendship with a \u201cfriend\u201d than his own wife\u2019s mental health. Please update us once they\u2019re gone. They are going, right? You\u2019ve tolerated this BS for far too long. Why, no one knows. ESH", "If this is real, NTA.\n\nStart the eviction process. You will need to formally evict them.\n\nThe problem with the early 20s is that people are idealistic. You went into this in good faith thinking you were helping them with no idea as to the depths of their laziness and how problematic this would be.\n\nDo NOT allow them a nursery. They get the room they are staying in only while you go through the eviction process. Only their bedroom. Pile their stuff in there.\n\nDo not make living in your home comfortable for them. He is playing video games all day? That console better be in the bedroom they share. Same with her work from home set up. Everything needs to be in that bedroom. They do not get access to the rest of the house as they are not tennants. \n\nThese guys are freeloaders and the load needs to be put back on their shoulders ASAP.", "Wait, they think they are getting another room for the baby?", "NTA. Ask your husband what is he getting from his friendship from Seth and is it worth you moving out with your child to keep that friendship? Is it worth exposing your toddler to secondhand pot smoke (no judgement on adult choices, but your child is not choosing to smoke). Read up on the current studies on the subject.\n\nYou agreed to one year based on good faith that they would be working towards saving for their own place. That isn't happening and you are no longer able to live in chaos. You need to decide what your plan is if your husband says his friends stay. Can you and your toddler move in with family until next August? Can you afford a one bedroom apartment? Is your husband worth the headache of figuring this all out (kind of joking on this last one, but I would be questioning my marriage heavily).\n\nEven if your husband says they have to go, you may have to evict them as it doesn't sound like there was a lease or written agreement. Your husband's act of kindess has created a nightmare.\n\nCan they live in the back with the cats?", "NTA for wanting that. You need to tell them immediately what you are thinking and how it is making you feel. And that they need incomes and to do their share of things around the house, or they are out even with a newborn baby. You aren't the welfare department, you are not their parents taking care of them, you won't take their abuse any more. Lay it out for them so they cannot possibly misunderstand what you mean. Then throw them out next week.", "O.P take some more writing classes, cause this script is awful.", "You should have said something sooner. (I know you thought you had another month, before they baby arrived) if something goes wrong (with this being a high risk pregnancy and a month early) you would be the worst people if you kicked them out after that.\nAnd with a new born they will be occupied with the baby, and again you would be the bad guy if you kicked them out right away.
