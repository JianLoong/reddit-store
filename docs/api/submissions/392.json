All of this is done in front of people whether it be people we know or complete strangers.

Only thing is you have to be physically fit. I put in the work to get into shape because I was told that one of the employees (who happens to be her friend)\u00a0 wanted my cv and that he could possibly get me a position because he heard that I wanted to go into that line of work.

I haven't told her that though. She's been asking me constantly when I'm going to go again because she wants to as well and honestly I do not want to. I just don't feel the need to deal with her at home and somewhere else where I feel that I'd be at peace even if it's for an hour or two five times a week. I only know that if we go together I'd stop going within a week because I wouldn't be able to put up with her comments. If that's not bad enough I know she'd say it loud enough for everyone around us to hear. What comes from this is that if my appearance starts improving she'll take credit for it which wouldn't be the case at all because I've noticed that in some areas I'm more disciplined than she is. \n\nThe problem now is that I want to start going to the gym soon but if she finds out she'll ask me why I didn't include her and I won't know what to say because I'd have to tread lightly as well. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667204016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi4n34/aita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_any/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can choose to go low or no contact if it would be healthier for you.  The universe has given you permission.\n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s a devastating person to be around, and some of what you\u2019re describing are narcissistic traits.  When someone has a lot of narcissistic traits, limiting contact with them and putting them on an information diet often helps a lot with the mental health of their target/victim.\n\nNTA", "NTA Do you have different gyms around you area? If so go to one you know your mother wouldn't like to go to cause it's too far or too shabby and tell her you go with a friend and make sure it's always at times when she works or isn't free. You can say that you're adapting to your friend's schedule so you can't change the time you go and anyways she would feel left out since you guys have such a good relationship. This is only a bandaid solution though. In the future you really need to have a talk with your mother and set boundaries. I know it's not easy but when you are independent and financially strong enough to have your place and your life you need to tell her you won't see her again unless she respects you and your life choices without embarrassing you in public constantly and undermining your life opportunities. You don't have to put up with her crap, if she doesn't want to understand then you're better off without her in your life.", "Sounds like your mother is emotionally abusing you. Not only does she neg and humiliate you, but she also cost you a job because she somehow couldn't give his friend your CV and giving you his email so you could do it yourself is a problem (?).\n\nNTA. I would advise you to seriously think about whether you want your mother to be a part of your life going forward. You are definitely entitled to weed out whoever you want from your life if they're causing you emotional distress. Even if it's your own mother. Even if it's your only living relative.", "NTA.
