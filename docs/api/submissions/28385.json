She attempts to talk to them but doesn't really say anything. She tried to get closer to them but they don't like it when she does that. \r It wasn't surprising to me.\r When we went to visit once, we talked about our kids and theirs including Josh's sister. If she had friends she wouldn't have tried to befriend younger kids. \r  \n\r  \nOne day, our kids were having a sleepover at Josh's, in addition to another friend (Sara). We dropped them off, said hi to the parents, and left. Clara is a very light sleeper, if anyone walks into the room she'll wake up. Since Josh sometimes snores, his parents prepared the guest room for Clara to sleep in (the guest room is beside Josh's, his sister and the parents' rooms). \r  \n\r  \nSo, during that sleepover, Clara woke up and saw that Josh's sister was in her room standing by the door. The girl said that the air conditioner didn't work in her room and she felt hot. She apologized and left.

She walked and saw the girl leaving Josh's room, where Josh, Jack, and Sara were sleeping. The girl said she forgot her charger in there (she was holding a charger) so Clara didn't think she was lying, but it was scary at night. She told Clara to go and sleep unless she didn't like the guest's room she could sleep in her parents' room, or hers.\r Clara said \"Thanks, but I'm comfortable in the guest's\".

Did you just say sleepovers and play dates at your house are off because your daughters weird and unsettling? Or did you explain what happened and that it is concerning behavior and scary obviously for a child to be woken in the middle of the night like that. Depending on what you said and how it was said it could be  understandable for the other parents to be upset by you. Think about how you might feel if someone spoke about your kids that way. But at the end of the day keep your kids safe even if it hurts someone else\u2019s feelings. You are definitely not wrong for not allowing them over there as the other comments mentioned if this were a boy would you even be questioning this? \n\nHopefully it was a knee jerk reaction to protect their daughter in the moment but they actually sit and think about what you\u2019re telling them and get that girl some help or at least don\u2019t let her around any of their sons other friends\u2026", "This is the fakest thing that ever faked.", "How old are the twins?", "YTA for how you said it\nNTA for protecting your kids", "I don\u2019t understand how you can ask us to judge this without giving the age of your kids.

All of what you posted is extremely troubling. I would have done the same thing.\n\nOn a different note: why should their child's comfort mean more than your child?

The wording wasn\u2019t great. Calling a teenager \u201cquestionable and unsettling\u201d is pretty harsh. You could have gone with \u201cthis happened and we aren\u2019t comfortable with that\u201d  but you called their child a creep instead. Especially post global-lockdowns people across all ages suck at social norms as we\u2019ve been home for awhile, kids (which does include teenagers) have missed out on key social phases so some of them will be a little stunted and weird. The fact that she didn\u2019t act like she was \u2018caught\u2019 does lean towards she may just not realize it was weird. \n\nThat being said, nta for listening to your sister. I\u2019m a firm believer that when the spidey-sense tingles, especially when it involves children, it is always better to be seen as rude or over-protective then to ignore the feeling and find out it was right.

I waited tables 7 days a week, 4 12-14 hour shifts, 3 8 hour shifts from Dec to April. Restaurant servers rarely have a chance to pee during a shift, and we rarely make it through a glass of soda or water during a shift, too. I thought I was prone to UTIs but eventually discovered restaurant servers, nurses, and flight attendants tend to have chronic UTI issues because they are chronically dehydrated and rarely urinate during the shift. \n\nAnyway I had a UTI and had to hoof it down a mountain (In the Rockies!) to get to the ski town at base, where there was a single doctor's office/ER in a tiny building (like a single-wide mobile home), with a nurse and a doctor and the ski patrol wilderness EMTs.\n\nThe doctor decided to insist I had chlamydia, despite my having not had sex in 4 years at that point. There was an argument, and he ended up leaving a bottle of UTI antibiotics pills and a bottle of chlamydia medication on the end of the bed and told me he'd leave the room while I made my choice. I grabbed the antibiotics and begged some AZOs off the nurse, then had to walk all the way back up the mountain (class 4 road from base to 10,000 feet to my ski-to restaurant) with a swollen, infected bladder, angry and ashamed and in truly incredible pain with every shuffling step.\n\nThe restaurant I worked for was styled after an authentic Bavarian ski haus, and the girls wore dirndls to serve while the guys wore lederhosen. \n\nTwo days later, my bladder still swollen and screaming with every step, the doctor shows up in my section during the lunch rush. He stays until we close the patio at apre. I had 25 tables outside that all needed bottles of mustard and glass bottles of water cleared off before the sun dipped below the mountains and everything froze (literally minutes after sunset any liquid would develop a thick ice crust, not great for housemade mustards). The mustards all went into a giant hutch in a heated vestibule. There were massive wooden doors that lead into the main indoor dining area, kept closed for warmth, and another set that lead onto the patio, kept open so I could shuffle-hustle bottles of mustard off the tables and into the hutch. \n\nI was standing on my tiptoes loading mustards into the hutch, putting them onto shelf above my head. My arms were raised and I was leaning into the hutch.\nThe doctor grabbed me from behind. He put his hands on my hips and slammed his crotch into my backside, grabbed at my front and then ran his hands up my body. His head was on my shoulder and he whispered into my ear \"I've always wanted to do that\" and he shoved his hands into my bra and grabbed my breasts, and left money there when he pulled his hands out, and I was so shocked I screamed \"It is not chlamydia, I am not a hooker!!\" and he slammed into my backside again and left.\n\nA few weeks (August 2023) back I had to have a breast exam and requested a female doctor instead of my male primary. My primary had offered a female doctor if I wanted one, and I said absolutely, yes. Then he came out to the front desk and told me, in front of everyone, that he understood women wanted a female gyno, or at least of course a female nurse in the room with a male gyno, but he never understood why some women felt the need to request female doctors for something as simple as a breast exam.\n\nIf he had breasts, he told me, he wouldn't be so concerned about them. \"If I were a woman I would probably want a female gynecologist, but I wouldn't care who I had for a breast exam. It just doesn't seem like it should matter. It wouldn't matter to me, if I had breasts.\"\n\nI don't have health insurance. I have an excellent trade job but no union. I go to a charity teaching clinic associated with a university.\n\nThere are no other primary care doctors, so now when I need to be seen I get to sit with this jilted doctor, who would never need a female doctor for a breast exam, so I must be overly sensitive and reactive to everything.\n\nThere is no escaping it.

This incident with the ski town doctor was not the most violent assault from a customer( that broke bones and inflicted a major TBI), but then this was not a customer.\n\nThis was a doctor who came to my work to have me serve him food and drink in my beer-girl outfit and then intentionally and specifically assault me, knowing that I was ill and he was the only doctor in town.
