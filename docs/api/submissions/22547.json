I wouldn't want someone anywhere, especially when drinking is involved, they didn't approve of. \n\nIf the family is taking his side, it means they're just as unsupportive as he is, they just don't vocalize it. Id apologize to Zo\u00e9 for not talking with her first about what course to take BUT she should understand that anyone opposed to your wedding shouldn't be there, family or not. That is just a powder keg waiting to go off. Like I can clearly see the dad sitting there drinking ready to launch onto a fully homophobic rant during his speech making everyone uncomfortable, especially you and Zo\u00e9", "NTA.\n\nAsk Zoe why she cares so much about people who do not love or respect her?\n\nHer father is homophobic, his family members who are currently supporting him are homophobic.\n\nAnd as hard as this is to hear - if Zoe can\u2019t understand that, then maybe she doesn\u2019t deserve to be in a relationship with you, as she doesn\u2019t really respect you or herself.", "You should have talked to Zo\u00e9 first, perhaps, but her family's catering to her father's homophobia isn't your fault. NTA.\n\nBut, it's likely the wedding is ruined. Possibly the relationship. Which, ironically, is I suppose what the old bastard would want.", "ESH\nShould of been a joint decision. This wedding is going to be awful for Zoe now. That\u2019s if it still goes ahead.", "ESH - you don't unilaterally decide something for both of you as a couple. That's not cool no matter how much her father deserved it.", "Uninviting a guest that you've both agreed on should have been decided by both of you. You may get the wedding you want, too bad your wife can't have hers. If you had allowed her to handle it, you may not have had her entire side of the family pull out.", "NTA Nah fuck all of them. You will be better off. I'd personally reach out to each member of her family and ask them if their bigotry will stop them from coming to your wedding. If they are unwilling to come, then they don't respect you, don't deserve to celebrate with you, and certainly don't deserve money spent on them.", "NTA for sticking up for your relationship, but you should have discussed it with Zoe before uninviting her father. At the end of the day, you hurt Zoe\u2019s feelings the most, and maybe even your relationship with her.", "NTA for putting him in his place but, yes, a little YTA for not discussing it with Zoe. \n\nJustified though you may be, this could impact her relationship with her family for much longer than just the wedding day. You may be happy to not have much to do with them but families are complicated and she may want to keep a good relationship with them despite everything. Bottom line is that the fallout will affect her more than you.", "INFO: How does Zoe feel about your actions?  Is she happy you put him in a box or is embarrassed by it?", "You should not uninvite anyone from your partner\u2019sside. If you don\u2019t want someone, you can express that to your partner and she may or may not entertain your request. Problem is you have not only ruined the wedding day for her but also severely impacted her relationship with her family. At the end of the day, it is her family and let her handle their bigotry. For this soft YTA", "Over 50% end in divorce. Think extremely carefully before cutting off family. Sorry if that sounds awful but this is the fact. \n\nHowever, the Dad is bang out of line. Maybe he will come round after sitting him down and talking everything through. \n\nNTA.", "YTA\n\nI understand where you're coming from. But he's Zoe's father, not yours. It wasn't your place to uninvite him. It's purely Zoe's decision.\n\nEdit: just to make it clear, her father is a big AH, a bigot. And I'm not saying you shouldn't have spoken up. I'm just saying it wasn't your place to uninvite him. You could have discussed it with Zoe but ultimately it would be her decision as it's her father.", "YTA, you unilaterally made the decision for Zoe, tanking her relationship with her family and ruining the wedding for her. You should have discussed it with her first.", "NTA\n\nTell Zo\u00e9 that she might be okay with having homophobic people at her wedding, but you have too much self-respect to tolerate hate on the happiest day of your life. Having said that, there is room for a conversation, because I'm sure Zo\u00e9 is aware of her dad's feelings and has her own logic and feelings on it. You can also be empathetic to her feelings and talk about future boundaries. Not everyone's family is as accepting and supporting as I assume yours are. Maybe Zo\u00e9's dad is doing his best, which apparently had been not protesting until he went on homophobic tirade.", "NAH, except her dad obviously. You don\u2019t have to put up with being disrespected but Zo\u00e9 is. Within her right to be upset that the man who raised her won\u2019t be attending, I don\u2019t k is if she agrees with you or not either. It\u2019s not as easy as \u201coh he\u2019s homophobic 123 you\u2019re dead to me\u201d, lots of the straight cis people in the comments don\u2019t truly understand what it\u2019s like to be alienated from a family you still love, and neither do I because my family was really accepting but I still can understand how she feels.", "Mind if I make a suggestion? In my experience as an extremely old lady in a happy marriage,  I find it best to let each partner deal with their own side of the family.  Your FIL to be was an AH, but there would have been less drama all around if your fiancee stepped in to talk to him, and both of you probably should have been on the same page about disinviting a parent, before announcing it to the group. Like I tell the poor beleagued Mr Pisces in Sweden, *even if you're right, you're wrong if you make a big decisions involving both of us without discussing it with me first*.", "NTA he's clearly discriminating. And even tho it's Zoes dad, you're her future and she should respect your decision that you've made on the behalf of both of your relationship and happiness. \n\nNo likey, no invites is what I say!", "It looks like you may have missed a teaching moment.\nHe showed up. So he may not be beyond redemption.\nYou have to remember the world is moving a lot faster than it ever has before. Traditionally most ways of life go generation to generation giving people a really long time to adapt and change culturally. The last 100 years, heck even the last twenty years has socially evolved rapidly. I don\u2019t even like all of the changes and I\u2019m a nineties kid so I can see how he still has one foot stuck in tradition.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have made the decision like you did. That was for your wife to do had she felt it appropriate. I understand you were hurt and insulted and embarrassed for yourself and your wife.\nYou were right to feel that way. You went wrong when you disregarded how your fianc\u00e9 may feel with your decision making.\n\nI get really frustrated with the mentality these days that we should throw people away when we disagree with their morals. He disagreed with his daughters values but still loved her enough to show up. He can still be taught and given time and patience he may still come around.\n\nBest of luck to all of your family, I hope you all find a way to move on with love and acceptance for all of your differences \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA. Don't get me wrong, he's definitely an arsehole. But did you consider how Zoe feels at all? Or the impact this would have on her relationships with her family long term? You don't get to unilaterally make that decision.", "YTA. You're putting your wife in an immediate position to either choose for you or your family. Which is an extremely egoistic thing to do. Yes, her father is an AH and a bigot, but he is still the father of your wife. Those decisions should be made together. Instead of supporting her to deal with her asshole family (which is extremely hard), you're burning bridges.", "Nta. He disrespected u and your fiance.  Your relationship is a joke to him then why should he be a part of it.   \nHe will undermine you both and his prejudice will ruin your relationship over time.", "NTA for standing up to a bigot but you could have asked Zoe first. And the mature way would have been to have a detailed talk with her and explain to her your reasons for doing this and come to a conclusion together.", "I mean I would not marry a person that is close to their family, when their family doesn't respect me. I would not want to put up with that shit for the rest of my life.", "NTA, he left you with no other option.  But and this is a big but it is still probably going to create strife in your marriage which isn\u2019t fair.  You need to figure out how best to handle with your wife she is what is important.  Fuck him.", "ESH\n\nIt's pretty obvious that they're AHs for being homophobic and backing a homophobic person's behavior.\n\nBut you cannot make unilateral decisions for your wedding about Zoe's family without Zoe's input, OP. You charged in, white-knighted, and took over, and you helped to upset Zoe at her own engagement party. This is not an auspicious way to begin your engagement, already making decisions on your own instead of as a couple showing a united front.\n\nYou need to apologize to Zoe and ask what she wants to do next and if you really don't like it, you need to express your concerns in a way that doesn't attack her but still ultimately go with what Zoe wants to do.", "nta", "NTA", "NTA for telling off future father-in-law, but YTA for not discussing with your wife first.", "ESH. Maybe yor FIL is inconsiderate person, but you can't force people to change your feelings about you. And I say just one thing that makes you and many other people instantly hate me - I have nothing against LGBT people, I also could be friends with them,  but LGBT marriages is a sick joke.

The answer is always going to be \u201cbecause he\u2019s my father and I still love him.\u201d That doesn\u2019t just shut off immediately because he doubled down on his bigotry.

The goal of the OP isn't \"fixing\" those parents: that's their job to fix their own backwards views. The OP's goal is their own safety and peace of mind, which is and should be non-negotiable.

Why is it down to her to have to be the one to reach out to those who don't accept her? This isn't some petty disagreement, nor is it a both sides issue. It's an issue where the homophobic parent is 100% unequivocally in the wrong, and the family is also in the wrong for defending them. And they should both know better. These are adults in 2023.
