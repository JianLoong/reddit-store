In my experience as an extremely old lady in a happy marriage,  I find it best to let each partner deal with their own side of the family.

Instead of demonstrating love for Zoe and demonstrating that your love is like any love between 2 people, you responded in an aggressive way to someone who may be ignorant, but loves his daughter.

She's the one who has to make the call whether or not to invite him. It's up to her to call out her family when they are disrespecting your relationship as well. I know that's easier said than done, but you need to strongly consider if she wants her dad around if you want this man in your life.

It doesn't work both ways.\n\nI do feel for Zoe though, finding out that she doesn't have the support of a loving family simply because of a sexual orientation she can't control.  She might need more help than you can give, because it looks like she's going to lose much of her family and maybe her whole immediate family.  She's going to need TLC from you and perhaps therapy from an expert to confirm that she didn't do anything wrong and isn't unworthy.\n\nHow does your family feel?  Do they accept you, and are they taking her into the fold so that she's not alone except for you?  That would help immensely.", "ESH - Obvious he's an asshole, but it's sort of a rule that you deal with your side of the family and your partner deals with her side of the family.

Hurt Durr... Do you realise that a person can be wrong on one thing, right at other places ? \n\nAs I said before:\n\n1. Homophobia is completely unjustifiable.\n\n2. Not accepting who your own daughter is and her relationship is not a small thing. It is a dealbreaker. You can't have a functional relationship with someone who fundamentally does not accept or respect a core part of who you are.\n\n> The father might be a homophobe but he also might have loved his daughter to the core, might have sacrificed for her upbringing. \n\nYou don't know the father, so this is just you searching for reasons he isn't the bad guy.\n\nI could just as easily speculate that he was a deadbeat dad, or abusive, or neglectful, or any number of negative things.\n\nAnd if he loves her so much, why can't he accept her as she is?\n\n> When you get married, you accept the good and the bad side of your loved one. \n\nExactly. This is why if I was OP, I wouldn't marry that person. Because marrying that person also means welcoming homophobes into her life.\n\n> Standing up to the bigotry of father was the job of his daughter, not op's. \n\nThen she should have done it herself.\n\n> Nobody is asking anyone to be the bigger person, but there is a way of handling things. \n\nWell yes, the person I replied to was operating on \"be the bigger person\" logic, which puts the burden on the wronged party to make things right.\n\nMy belief is that if you are in the wrong, then it is on you, and not the person you wronged, to reach out to make amends.\n\nHomophobia is wrong. The father was wrong to make a disparaging comment on his daughter's relationship with her fiancee. Therefore, he should be the one to make amends. Instead he dug in his heels on some parental authority nonsense when his daughter and her fiancee are fully-grown adults.\n\n\"Be the bigger person\" logic is so frustrating because it simply perpetuates bad people when the people they wrong are either pressured to let it go, or to be the ones to come to them to repair the relationship they damaged.\n\n> Putting down your in-laws, irrespective of right or wrong reasons,\n\nWhat do you mean \"irrespective\"? Of course who is right and who is wrong matters.\n\n> without consulting your spouse results in no winner as has happened with op... Who do you think came out as winner in all that thing .... The bride ? Op ? The father ? Or his family ?\n\nI'd say the OP. Now she knows where she stands with her fiancee's family. She'd certainly be the loser if she welcomed and accepted homophobia into her life.
