Either 1) the father learns his lesson, 2) he doesn\u2019t and OP doesn\u2019t have to deal with his crap at her wedding, or 3) worst case, there is no marriage and OP doesn\u2019t have to deal with homophobic abuse forever.  Maybe it won\u2019t feel like a victory short term, but even in the worst case scenario, she finds out about her fianc\u00e9, finds her inner strength and it is always a victory when bigots get put in their place.", "> Father not like gays, father bad... Hurt Durr... Do you realise that a person can be wrong on one thing, right at other places ? \n\nAs I said before:\n\n1. Homophobia is completely unjustifiable.\n\n2. Not accepting who your own daughter is and her relationship is not a small thing. It is a dealbreaker. You can't have a functional relationship with someone who fundamentally does not accept or respect a core part of who you are.\n\n> The father might be a homophobe but he also might have loved his daughter to the core, might have sacrificed for her upbringing. \n\nYou don't know the father, so this is just you searching for reasons he isn't the bad guy.\n\nI could just as easily speculate that he was a deadbeat dad, or abusive, or neglectful, or any number of negative things.\n\nAnd if he loves her so much, why can't he accept her as she is?\n\n> When you get married, you accept the good and the bad side of your loved one. \n\nExactly. This is why if I was OP, I wouldn't marry that person. Because marrying that person also means welcoming homophobes into her life.\n\n> Standing up to the bigotry of father was the job of his daughter, not op's. \n\nThen she should have done it herself.\n\n> Nobody is asking anyone to be the bigger person, but there is a way of handling things. \n\nWell yes, the person I replied to was operating on \"be the bigger person\" logic, which puts the burden on the wronged party to make things right.\n\nMy belief is that if you are in the wrong, then it is on you, and not the person you wronged, to reach out to make amends.\n\nHomophobia is wrong. The father was wrong to make a disparaging comment on his daughter's relationship with her fiancee. Therefore, he should be the one to make amends. Instead he dug in his heels on some parental authority nonsense when his daughter and her fiancee are fully-grown adults.\n\n\"Be the bigger person\" logic is so frustrating because it simply perpetuates bad people when the people they wrong are either pressured to let it go, or to be the ones to come to them to repair the relationship they damaged.\n\n> Putting down your in-laws, irrespective of right or wrong reasons,\n\nWhat do you mean \"irrespective\"? Of course who is right and who is wrong matters.\n\n> without consulting your spouse results in no winner as has happened with op... Who do you think came out as winner in all that thing .... The bride ? Op ? The father ? Or his family ?\n\nI'd say the OP. Now she knows where she stands with her fiancee's family. She'd certainly be the loser if she welcomed and accepted homophobia into her life.

Your spouse may love their family, despite their flaws, and want to maintain relationships with them.", "If my partner didn't kick him out immediately id call off the wedding", "If someone is hurling an insult towards me in real time (and previously to my mother about me), I'm not going to pause until someone else can deal with the person, much less in a party where I'm responsible for invitations.\n\nI'm pretty sure those would be fighting words for my father for example (again, not gay, but I don't think many decent parents would let that kind of behavior slide, OP's mother certainly didn't).\n\nIt's an absolute disrespect of such monumental size, that the only reason I think everyone else didn't act, was because they didn't even know how to react to someone making such a clown of themselves.", "Nobody\u2019s saying that Zoe\u2019s father isn\u2019t damaging, but the whole point is that OP should have not made such a knee-jerk decision. She should have at the very least talked with Zoe first. This was a huge decision that far more negatively impacts Zoe than OP. OP was being reactive instead of thoughtful and honestly selfish instead of being considerate of her partner.", "True, I just feel OP shouldn't have to put up with bigotry and homophobia just because it's attached to family of the woman she loves. She should get a say in  her fiancee's famly not being invited to the wedding, and she is justified in feeling that way. Compassion shouldn't go at the cost of herself, it should be alongside her boundaries.", "Where was Zoe's compassion when her father was treating OP like shit?!\n\nWhere was Zoe's compassion when she sat there and let her father ruin their engagement party?!\n\nEveryone is telling OP to have compassion when Zoe is letting this shit happen. \n\nWhere's compassion for OP?", "Yeah OP definitely should have talked to her partner first, I think that's a conversation they should have had in private first.\n\nI just don't understand all the comments saying that the dad isn't homophobic and just needs to learn. They're getting married, this is the time for them to celebrate, but future FIL is just shitting all over their relationship and it isn't okay. But by not allowing her fiance to come to that conclusion herself and making the decision without consulting her, OP completely changed the dynamics about how the conversation is going to go.\n\nIt's definitely going to be a sticking point that either makes or breaks the marriage, that's for sure.", "Bare minimum expectation for your spouse is to stick up for them in front of their family. OP did nothing wrong but fianc\u00e9e sounds like a bad partner", "But why does OP have to be subject to all that disrespect and abuse at her OWN wedding?", "I\u2019m having trouble blaming OP for this.  OP shouldn\u2019t have to put up with someone actively hating and disparaging her at her own wedding, and it\u2019s too much for Zoe to ask her to have such a person at the wedding.  I get that Zoe is upset over this, but if Zoe hadn\u2019t backed up OP, it would\u2019ve been the end of the relationship.  I think OP and Zoe should have a convo, but the dad\u2019s exclusion from the wedding is a fait accompli - Zoe never had a reasonable choice other than disinviting her father.", "It is also OP\u2019s wedding. As a bride, she deserves to feel safe and comfortable on her own wedding day. She deserves to be surrounded by people who love her and support her marriage.", "OP though has a right to be at her own wedding, without having to deal with homophobia, insults and being bullied or abused. \n\nThis is a HUGE topic, with lots of intricacies. Maybe seek some couples therapy regarding setting boundaries that OP can live with, and Zoe can live with. OP should not subject herself to hate, simply because her GF refuses to set boundaries with her family. And Zoe should not have to get married without people she wants there. If those people are incompatible with her partner then Zoe needs to decide who or what is more important. (Maybe a courthouse wedding, with a party later on?)", "No, it doesn't mean accepting his presence at the wedding.  The wedding is for both of them and the OP isn't saying Zoe can never contact her father, they are saying that he will not be present on a day that is a huge deal for both of them. \n\n She is right to do it and Zoe can repair or tolerate her relationship with her family on her own time.", "OP for SURE knows what's better for Zo\u00eb than Zo\u00eb does here, Future FIL in absolute ass, the \"don't rock the boat\" family members going along with future FIL are ass, and Zoe needs to wake up and smell the coffee (or ass) already.", "Sticking up for yourself and your partner is different than making a unilateral decision. OP could've stood up for them and not mentioned attending the wedding, then talked with soon to be wife and they jointly proceeded from there. It's not all or none, there are so many options available in between. Honestly, OP could've just kicked dad out of the party and been done with it for the night. From OP's comments, they're still figuring out whether dad is attending or not, so yeah, clearly they needed to talk about this before a public proclamation was made.", "Exactly. You can apply this to all dysfunction families. People need to stop gatekeeping or nothing will ever change. So the person from the dysfunctional family just had to be alone forever because things aren't easy with their family. My family can be a nightmare too but my husband deals with it because he loves me and we try to work it out, set boundaries and understand each other's point of view on it.", "Yep.  Totally agree. Internalized homophobia is all over this comment section.", "So much abuse is perpetuated under this \u201cI must take care of everyone and make everyone else feel happy, to my detriment\u201d which is exactly what you described. \n\nSome of us are ok letting our abusers rot, and moving on to our best lives without their toxicity.", "I am pointing out that leaving an abusive relationship is a lot harder than just leaving the boat. Abusers tend to financially, socially, and emotionally isolate their victims, leaving the abuser as the only source of support the victim has. This becomes more true when the victim has a child or children with the abuser.  The victim feels compelled to stay to protect and economically support their children.\n\nThe family, especially Zoe's mom could be under the thumb of her dad, and do not see a means of escape.  If Zoe has younger siblings that are still living at home, they may feel compelled to do as they are told, otherwise they lose whatever financial support they have.", "If he was racist and OP was black or Asian or Indian would you say the same thing?", "> but the fiance's family is attempting to erase the existence of the OP.\n\nHow do you figure?", "Someone can be Black with a white parent. \"Your mother was one of the good ones but I wanted you to marry white so the grandkids would look like me.\" It's bigoted and it's okay for OP to not want anything to do with someone who is hateful against her.", "Good for you!", "Yeah I do not get it. I grew up in a very liberal household and my main childhood babysitter was my elderly gay cousin. No one in my family  thought twice about it then or even before   in the 1950s and 60s when he was happily partnered. My daughter is not straight- we are not sure if she is non-binary, a lesbian or which direction life will take her. Anyone who does not accept her wholly for herself can not just GTFO but go straight to hell, \u201cfamily\u201d or not.", "If he stood there and said it was not natural for his daughter to marry a black man, would you still push for \u201cfamily dynamics\u201d to be the priority?", "Yes. I would.\n\nZoe, the op's fiance needs to be the one dealing with this.\n\nDon't get me wrong. If she is choosing not to, I wouldn't be progressing with the relationship.\n\nIf she doesn't deal with it, it shows she is open to her father. That will turn into bringing eventual kids to see him. That's even worse as the kids would be black ir Asian or Indian.\n\nIf the father was racist and I'd be saying the same thing. Zoe needs to deal with the father.", "It is not just the wife\u2019s wedding. It is OP\u2019s wedding too.", "I'm sorry but I've broken up with a gf in the past because she wouldnt stop her homophobic family from lashing out at us. My family were also bigots and I got sick of dealing with them so we are very very very very LC. Yeah they're family, but if they're assholes I'm putting my foot down about not being around them. My now ex cut her family out after they were also terrible to her next gf. I'm happy she was finally strong enough to do so, but bitter that I wasnt important enough to her for her to do it for me.\n\nIf someone is being homophobic to me I am going to stand my ground, regardless of who they are related to.", "Nah, dad is just going to go, sneer, and make increasingly loud, bigoted comments as he gets more and more loaded throughout the evening.\n\nOP is allowed to defend herself. Dad can attempt to make amends.", "You serious?\n \nThe word dad used was \"unnatural.\"\n \nLots of folks running cover for homophobes here.", "Well in the actual example the father is insulting his *own* daughter and calling *her* unnatural, so I think we can take this one on its own merits. It's really bad!\n\nIn both cases, I would be sympathetic to both the partner's kicking the dad out *and* the (adult) child having a big intense emotional response to it because of the intensity of family dynamics and irrational loyalty. Both are totally normal and expected responses to atrocious behavior!"]}
