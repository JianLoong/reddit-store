He\u2019s been a father figure for me at different points in my life and my niece and nephew are like younger siblings to me.  It was important to me for him to be there.  \nI did not share with her that I was inviting him, because I wanted her to not be dramatic about it and I wanted her to still show up.

You knew she'd react badly, so you can't really complain that she literally reacted that way. This could have been avoided if you had just told her and then she could have chosen not to come to your wedding.", "I guess she's more upset you hid from her the fact he was attending your wedding. Why else would she be fine with still spending time with him after the divorce, going on vacations with him? \n\nThe last part could be explained by their kids going with them as well, but still, she's fine being around him for days during a vacation, but couldn't \"suck it up\", as they say, for a few hours at your wedding.\n\nMy point is she's most likely mad at you for inviting him without telling her, not asking her permission, but informing her. I still think NTA because she could have expressed her being upset at you without making a scene and getting others involved in a matter that didn't concern them.", "YTA.", "NTA - im sorry for the loss of your FIL.

It's your wedding, you can invite anyone but you should be honest so your sister can decide not to attend if she doesn't want to. It's rather rude to ambush like that. \n\nYour ex BIL, your sister and their children is still consider a family unit, even after divorce. So her being  okay with him in their children's life is normal isn't it? But him still chummy with her siblings is a different story. It might be irrational on her side but you did make a lot of assumptions. \n\nShe's an AH for trying to be dramatic and not being tactful when you are dealing with your FIL passing.", "NTA overall, you can invite whoever you want and it's your day and not your sister's.

Why keep dragging it out it was someone you wanted there.", "Kinda low-key ESH you knew that she will be pissed off at you once she got to found out and you kept it to yourself till the the wedding, but I kinda get why you did it.

I also am military and have a pretty stressful job, so I did that for myself.  \n\nShe also talks to him regularly enough because she found out I had been talking to him this summer (which should have been the indication I was inviting him) FROM HIM, and didn\u2019t talk to me for a month.

What I'm talking about is that the OOP called you out for blindsiding her and you answering like you didn't know it would matter to her, when in reality, you knew full well it would be a big issue for her and you deliberately decided to be manipulative. \n\nAnd no, paying doesn't mean you get who you want. It means you invite who you want. People should still get to choose whether to come or decline, without you hiding the truth to manipulate them into coming.", "Then why withhold it if it was such a nonissue? \n\nOr telling her would threaten her even showing up to begin with.\n\nBecause it can\u2019t be both", "So I see what you mean. Where I\u2019m coming from specifically why I think \u201cit wouldn\u2019t matter\u201d, my niece-who is basically like my little sister, has invited them both to her graduation, and she (my sister)  has sucked it up and dealt with being around for the event.\nMy nephew invited them all for Christmas, she managed to square it away and handle 9 days in Europe with him.\nI figured-ok-neph got her to deal with it, niece got her to deal with it, and now for my event, she\u2019ll be able to deal with it.  She and my BIL adopted me when I was 15, so that relationship is very parental to me, so I suppose I had the expectation she would react the way she did for them and just be angry or have her attitude and let it go. This is obviously not the case. \nDid I think it wouldn\u2019t matter because she talks to him still-yes a little bit. But-I\u2019m learning she is the only one who wants contact with him out of me and my siblings. We all apparently have to cut contact. \nDid I think she would be dramatic? Also yes, because she is dramatic about just about everything.  There\u2019s a lot to the story, and I\u2019m sure maybe it seems like I\u2019m just trying to paint myself in a better light-I know I suck for not telling her prior and maybe giving her the option to not show up\u2026but damn\u2026you get to cut your family out for not removing someone from their life for you?", "I can see your point. But the additional response from her after at this point seems extra dramatic for no good reason.", "She can only define HER relationship with her ex. Defining anyone else\u2019s is not her privilege. There is a possibility all the other interactions worked because she had time to prepare herself, and you denied her that. Which is problematic.", "For sure, it's inappropriate. More than that in fact. It's heartless and self-centered.\n\n(I'm talking about her texts. Her behavior at the wedding is run-of-the-mill asshole but her texts on the day before the funeral is really next level asshole).", "I understand. And agree. It\u2019s frustrating."]}
