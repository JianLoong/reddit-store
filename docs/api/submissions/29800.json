They will grow up and realize their parents gave them something really cool and how they acted like a brat about it because they didn't sit there and watch.", "Where was it said that they watch everything else? I\u2019m sure OP has left out some info but my response was based on what I read. Especially saying they would come but then changed their mind. The whole \u201cwe paid for all this stuff so it\u2019s ok for us to tell our child we\u2019re going to a winery instead of watching you go around in circles for an hour and a half\u201d is shit \n\nAnd classic judgement about me without having a clue. I am a parent of 2 teenagers, coached their sport and watch them play every chance I get (literally typing this waiting for my son\u2019s basketball to start). I\u2019m well aware of what it was like to be a teenager and not have your parents come and watch and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to have my kids go through that .", "Where was the part that said OP\u2019s parents paid for everything?? Because I paid for my dance classes and my parents barely showed up to my recital. So it Frickin happens.", "No.", "That\u2019s not how parenting works. Every parent knows that.", "Mate\u2026parenting is not just paying for shit and driving them\u2026quality time is part of it too. OP literally said his parents knew how much this race meant to him and they decided to go elsewhere. This is an asshole move and the kid will never forget it", "Also, they went back on their promise.  Sure, parents aren't required to be able to make every race, and since OP is not on a team, likely no one else to fall back on, but that response + going back on their promise seems like pretty AH things to do.", "So what now, parents are not allowed to have fun once in a while? So poor 15 yo would not suddenly realize that not in his parents life is about him? Oh how cruel /s", "You don't have to support a hobby like this and drive your kid around the province.", "I am not white. So I always wonder why white parents want to kick their kids after 18. Now I understand. Living with a bunch of entitled ingrates is quite miserable. Kicking \ud83e\uddb6 them out at 18 makes sense now.\n\nI have 3 kids who are doctors and lawyers. None of them shows even a tiny sense of entitlement as you online redditors. What a stupid generation!", "Not going to the race is not bad parenting, it sounds like they go to enough for this spoiled child to be able to go all over, what a child. How is this 15yr olds today. Weak.", "They drive him around to all the other races that aren't close to home. That's plenty of effort, giving up weekend after weekend.", "Save this post on the off chance you ever have kids.", "Why is it Taylor swift fans are mostly female? Just wondering.", "You probably had the privilege of cussing at your parents and going to your room without them beating your ass", "All while ignoring calls from their kid in his late 20's asking for money again.", "Not necessarily, throwing money and providing material things is not enough for being a parent.", "\"I go all over the province of Ontario racing and my parents will take me to any race I want\"\nThats an area almost double the size of Texas.\n He doesn't just play cheap, easily accessible, popular and exciting basketball. OP RACES VEHICLES AS A HOBBY. NOT EVEN COMPETITIVELY.\n\nThe fact OP threw such a tantrum over it and how it's obviously the first time it's ever happened, this is obviously a \"fuck around and find out\" scenario. Guarantee he did the same thing to a sibling, or another family member and this was a taste of OPs own medicine. They didn't ban him from competing, they didn't refuse to take him, they didn't cut his funding.\n\nAnd now we've got a 15Yo OP trying to validate his tantrum online through strangers like you.", "You think dance classes cost the same as purchasing, fuelling, maintaining and transporting racing vehicles? And you think a 14/15yo child can fund that themselves?", "Chest you have no clue how expensive carting is, people who aren't rich have to secure sponsors just to be able to compete, OP ain't even competing.", "So because they didn\u2019t go to this race they just automatically spend no quality time with him at all ever? Reddit moment \ud83d\ude02", "I agree, the first Dad probably has a truck and trailer just to pull this kids shit around. He\u2019s doing more than most dads ever would.", "You liberal beta.", "That\u2019s called BEING A PARENT!!!! Don\u2019t have kids if you\u2019re not willing to!!!!", "I think you are in the wrong subreddit", "No not at all", "\u2026. So that falls under more info\u2026\n\nAll we know is they are spending a ton of time driving this kid around and potentially spending 30k a year on a single hobby\u2026.\n\nAlso notice I said likely ESH\u2026.\n\nThat\u2019s why I asked for multiple pieces\u2026\n\nPeople don\u2019t randomly shell out 10ks of dollars then don\u2019t show up to a big event\u2026", "WOW. \"Not even competitively...\" This was important to him. Obviously, go-karting isn't a career path, but this was important to him. So if your kid plays football/soccer/cheerleader/basketball/\"play cheap\"/etc., you go? Just not if it's a more expensive hobby? That you let your kid have?", "Ok champ. The fact you think because parents pay for things or drive him to other races it makes it entirely ok to just \u201cwe were gonna go to your race but we decided to go to a winery instead because watching you would be boring\u201d speaks massive volumes. Hope you never have kids", "Sir, I did dance and figure skating. \nMy coach got $100 an hour back then. \nMy dance classes cost $185 a month. \nMy session fees were $12 for 45 minutes and I had to have at least four hours a day. \nMy skates were $600 and the blade was $350. \nMy dance shoes were $85 and I needed a new pair every two months. \nMy tights for skating were $15-22. \nI skipped tights for ballet mostly and got away with wearing shorts. Teach knew I was broke. \nMy competition fees were about $85-95 for the first entry and about $40 for every additional entry in the same weekend and I always had to compete in 2-3 categories. \nMy dress cost around $100\nMy Swarovski stones for my dress cost about $85\nThe glue was $8 and yes I had to put them on myself. \nMy competition jacket/sweatshirt was around $50. \nThe pictures were $45 for the basic pack. \nThe video was $35. \nI learned how to edit my own music before any of my friends knew what garage band was so I saved a good $60 there. So that\u2019s nice, right??\nKindly sit down.", "Being a parent doesn\u2019t mean giving up your entire life and other relationships for your child. I go to everything I can go to, ballet recitals, plays, gymnastics competitions, football tournaments etc. But there are times that I want to go away with my siblings and do my own thing or go away with my husband and do our own thing. So I might miss one or 2 things every now and then. It isn\u2019t a big deal if your kids aren\u2019t spoilt/you are there for most things. I get one of my siblings or parents to watch them and they\u2019ll go to the events instead.", "Oh, sorry! I saw people had tried in the Taylor swift subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/s/uFTpN8zKKS) but they didn\u2019t get an answer there, so I decided to try my luck!", "What do you mean you say thanks when you can? Does that mean you don't thank them for each thing they do or give you?", "I feel like all of this is irrelevant because they told him they were gonna come to his race and then they didn\u2019t tell him they weren\u2019t. From how I understand this  that means he had a moment there where he was looking for his parents to share with them his enthusiasm for what he just did, just to search for them and then probably realise they are not there. Then he calls them and they tell him \u201ewe decided to do something for ourselves.\u201c hello\u2026.. try empathy. Obviously OP feels like shit here, everyone would be hurt by this lol. \nIf you don\u2019t want to go somewhere you can let the person know, especially your child Lmao.\nIt\u2019s not cool to treat people like this. And now OP being a teenager he\u2019s definitely not the asshole here. Regardless of how much money his parents spend on him, they still owe him a minimum of respect \ud83d\ude43\n\nI can come to all shows and miss one and I can still say sorry because I care about the fact that the person would have wanted me there.", "You're thinking emotionally instead of logically.\n\nYou don't think something may have triggered this?\nThey supported him completely the whole time u till this one specific time when their entire response flipped out of the blue?\nYou don't think a behaviour may have caused that?\nThey didn't stop him from doing what he loved in any way, they just changed one single action.", "Thats awesome. \nBut still wayyyy cheaper than the cost of being in motorsports lol\n\nBut good on you for funding yourself.", "It\u2019s a big deal because OP\u2019s parents made and broke a promise. A good parent should understand why that\u2019s unacceptable. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "O lol haha that was actually me that posted that I think", "Okay but my point was that yes, it does happen where a kid can work so hard to pay for everything and the parents couldn\u2019t care to show up to a race or show. So why are you picking on me?? Seriously. Why.", "I agree if you promised you should fulfil it. But in general, giving up every weekend for your child isn\u2019t the requirement to being a parent."]}
