Would you switch into clothing that isn't appropriate to wear at work at work while on lunch? Even if you're off the clock?\n\nI'm abit conflicted on this. While I wouldn't change out of my clothes during lunch break, if for whatever reason I had to come back to office after working hours (aka unpaid), I would absolutely not wear office-wear there. Maybe it's a cultural thing but if i'm lets say picking up some documents from the office on a weekend, I would just go and pickup my documents from my office in just a simple tshirt and jeans.\n\nI guess the main argument would be that how is napping and not disturbing anyone on my lunch break different than other coworkers who watch shows/tv/netflix at their desk during lunch? I could understand my colleagues argument if I was napping and other people were working beside me but this is a mandated 90 minute break where there is no obligation to work. If people wanted to, they could go home and sleep and as long as their back in the office by 1.30pm, no one would bat an eye.\n\n>how you feel about people in the break room is how people feel about you napping in the office. Break room behavior is not conducive to you napping, but you are takingyour break Behavior to a space specifically for working\n\nI think it's a bit different. I'm actively taking up a seat for someone who might want to sit down and eat in the breakroom as the seats are for anyone.
