It sounds like both of you were in different places and had different expectations about the situation. I don't think she was ready for a bomb this size, and misjudged the severity of the emotional impact saying it out loud had on you. And so did you, I think, or you wouldn't have made plans to go out and gotten reservations instead of just sitting together and talking.", "ESH / NAH\n\nYou had plans to go out. At some point, you easily could have noticed the time & communicated your feelings. Also, if you knew you were planning to have this conversation then, again you could have communicated that... \u201care you okay with staying in tonight because I would like to talk about some heavy stuff with you & don\u2019t know if I will be able to go to dinner\u201d \n\nYour friend should have been more empathetic to your situation but who knows what kind of day she had. She may not have been prepared to do more than relax & eat. \n\nThis seems like a simple miscommunication. I understand you\u2019re going through some stuff but your friend had no expectations other than going out to dinner & having an enjoyable night with you. You went in a different direction without letting her know you were potentially going to change the plans. Sounds like you were both just disappointed with each other\u2019s reactions.", "[removed]", "ESH. She should have handled it with more class, but it\u2019s also kind of frustrating and uncomfortable when you plan to go out and have fun with your friends and then they drop a bomb like that and suddenly your expected to just stop your plans and stay home. \n\nYes she was dismissive, but also, have some tact maybe? I mean who waits until right before the reservation, not even dressed and ready for drinks, and then drops something like that with the expectation their friend stops the plans and stays with you? Did you communicate that you were wanting to stay home and talk about it? She drove 40 minutes to go out and have fun with you and wanted to make your reservation. Why couldn\u2019t you keep talking about it in the car and at drinks? \n\nIt seems like your friend was just wanting to make it on time for the reservation. I don\u2019t understand what exactly you wanted from her here\u2026?", "NTA. She seems incredibly insensitive.", "NTA.\n\nYou trusted her with a serious problem and as your friend, she shouldn\u2019t dismiss you and try to be there for you. She only seems to care about herself and doesn\u2019t seem to be a caring, supportive friend at all.", "NTA. Your friend is more of a superficial friend. She apparently doesn't want to deal with the REAL work of being a friend.  I am personally sorry that you are going through this difficult time in your marriage. I am curious, and you certainly don't have to elaborate for random person's curiosity--did he know about the child all this time or did he just find out? Because if he just found out himself, then I think you might be able to come to terms. But if he knew and kept it from you; that is a different story. Anyway, I am sorry!", "Oh no she\u2019s not a great friend I\u2019m sorry NTA", "NTA. \n\nI can understand your friend wanted to go out but as a friend I would put your feelings above mine when you are hurting or need extra support. She could have offered to get takeout and a bottle of wine or something. Life is hard and we have change plans sometimes. She might be a great friend but in this moment she wasn\u2019t.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also found out not from my husband and it\u2019s whole story that\u2019s why It was taking time to tell my friend", "Exactly", "Oh wow so sorry ur dealing with that I don't understand why that would be kept from u. Plenty of ppl have kids from before their current relationship. Friend seems very insensitive. NTA. Things happen. A real friend would just say ok let's just hang out here then or would ask u what u wanted to do not get mad and dismiss ur feelings. Some Ppl rly have some nerve. Take care of yourself \ud83d\udc96", "NTA.  \n\nMy friend had exactly the same situation.  When she found out her husband had a child with someone else and attended the birth, she called me before I was due to spend time at the hospital.  She called me everyday for 3 hours, crying, wailing and wanting advice.  \n\nI gave her my time and interrupted my time in hospital to be there for her.  I thought I was being a supportive friend \n\nSo when I recently needed some help from her, she was the most patronising and unhelpful person you could imagine.  So much so that I want to remind her of this previous issue but I don't want to be as awful as she's been to me.  I'm considering torching the friendship.   But I realise that she'll need me when her other kids find out about their half sibling (she has limited friends because of her controlling  husband) ...... still considering torching the friendship though.  \n\nFind better friends, you can do better.  Everyone needs good friends.  Thats what I intend to do.  Good luck.  If you need someone to talk to DM me xx"]}
