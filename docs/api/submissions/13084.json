When I was 6 or so, she divorced our dad and decided to \"relive her lost youth and started partying and was never home. My brother had school and work so he could buy us meager amounts of food, so I was home a alone a lot, and had to cook for myself at that age when there was food, or scrounge change from mother's dresser so I could ride my bike along the highway to wendys so I could get a triple stack burger amd have a full stomach for a day. Or eat MLM energy bars we had when all else failed. \n\nWhen my mother WAS home, she would yell and scream and verbally abuse us. She hit me once, and my brother almost hit her with a frying pan in response. \n\nSuffice it to say,  I raised myself During that time, until i was 10 and moved in with my dad and step mother (he got cancer and wanted us to spend more time together, because or mother had made it hard before than) and while dad and step mother did their best the 3 years I was there, I was given enough freedom to continue developing on my own (with a loving watchful eye from my dad incase I needed it) but after he died when I was 13 and my step mother turned out to be a nightmare, I went back to living with my mother who immediately decided she could start parenting me as if I hadn't raised myself, ketp my own hours and took care of my self. Suffice it to say our relationship deteriorated after that due to the above, which got worse at 18, plus being queer (wasn't out as trans yet either) didn't help. It was at the point that even I was 22 and set move out when my roommate bailed, I told her to her face I'd rather live in my car than stay with her when she suggest I stay longer. Combine that with her reaction to being trans, her conspiracy bs and religious psycho shit, and yeah, you get me and my brother. Who are NC and not only will we make sure she's a ward of the state if she ever needs our help,  but won't even be at her funeral whenever that happens. \n\nIt should be a lesson to all parents that your children owe you nothing and that if they want nothing to do with you,  it's probably your fault.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. 100%.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of people are better grandparents than they were parents. I hear my younger friends say this a lot. Like, \"I barely recognize my mom when she's with my kids! Who is this woman?!\" Being a parent is hard but being a grandparent is easy. There's no real responsibility there. I felt how you feel, too. \n\nThat said, your mom is still pretty damaging. She isn't acting like a grandparent. She's trying to parent your baby and she's disparaging you.

You have no idea how many times I've heard \"I did my best\" from my own abusive mom. Well, her best wasn't good enough. You deserved better, and so does your baby. Just because she's throwing baby clothes at your child and a roof over your head doesn't mean she gets to think of your child as hers.\n\nI'm glad you're already doing what you can to get out of this situation, and wish you weren't there in the first place. Good luck.", ">\u201cI\u2019m just a terrible mom, I should\u2019ve just left you with grandma and grandpa\n\nYes and yes.\n\nI'm so sorry that you have to deal with this, and best wishes for finding your own place.", "That sounds awful. I can\u2019t imagine something like that happening. I\u2019m not jumping to conclusions, but please tell me your daughter isn\u2019t anywhere near that witch.", "When she buys stuff give it back, if she cries says why tell her cause you will throw it in my face later on.  Is there no where else you can stay while saving up for a place of your own?", "We\u2019re just going back to renting for now. I\u2019m going to go back to work full time and use my income as savings.", "[removed]", "Don\u2019t hate her. and I already acknowledged it a while ago but your absolute refusal to understand why I\u2019m not kissing her feet and rubbing her back every day for letting me stay here is why I\u2019m getting pissed. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be worshipped for doing the bare minimum.", "NTA, everything you said was correct and your mom needs to take a step back", "Nta.   Your kid not hers.  Act in the kids best interests", "You need to get out of there asap. Do you have any other friends or relatives you can stay with while you look? BFs family?\n\nThe longer you stay the more likely your mom can fight for visitation and gpr, and that would be without you. Your family would be better away from her. Not knowing a family member is better that being around one who abused your own parents.", "NTA. Dont you love it when abusive people try to play revisionist history.", "NTA - I had a lot to unpack with my mother about some of the stuff she did to me after my son was born. She was there and present, and a decent mom, but there was manipulation, and mental abuse splattered in.", "I had the same problem with my mom. What helped was when my children grew up and still resented my mother for her treatment of me.. was me telling them that I would of rather had a bad mom and good grandma for them than the other way around. I also realized that my mother did do the best she could at the time. She also came from bad parents so she hadn\u2019t known better. She was very codependent on men, and it was taboo to seek therapy back then. She is 70 now & I am the only person she has. My siblings, her grandchildren, and great grandchildren have nothing to do with her. It\u2019s much more difficult to carry a grudge on you than it is on the person who did wrong. Karma comes back around eventually. Good luck! I feel your pain!", "My mom was like this and we didn't start talking again until I told her I was pregnant with my daughter almost 5 years ago. I told her what I expected if she wanted to be in our lives and for the most part she has done that. I do think she is a wonderful grandmother to her grandkids. We do live in different states thought. She has done some things for my kids i wish i could do so badly. I look at as she is helping to give my kids a better life then i could do at this point.\nNTA I would set some hard and fast rules on these things, but still make it sound that you are appreciative for the things she has done. It is a very hard spot to be in.", "Things you make up aren't apparent, no.\n\nApparently a banana avatar indicates someone operating in bad faith.", "More like you struggled but she got by.", "What you said here reminds me a lot of my parents. My dad's family has all sorts of intergenerational trauma in it and he was having his own health issues as my brothers and I were born/growing up. Having parents there that know the cycle needs to end and are working towards that, like my own and you and your husband, is the only way to really break the chain. My parents were no contact with a lot of my dad's family and I didn't have grandparents on that side, but I'm better off for it now and sometimes removing those presences from our life is the best way to get through it.\n\nI just wanted to say you and your husband are doing wonderful, and I have no doubt that when you move out of your mother's house if you keep up this up the both of you and your son will flourish.", "Not just in contact.. they live with this crazy woman.\n\nAfter being completely ruined by her, she decided that the best place for her baby to live would be the same place she got ruined.\nWhats that disaese called again, munchhausen by proxy ( where you begin to love the abductor/abuser )\n\n\nI don't know what the financial situation is with you and your husband OP.. but please get the fuck away from her.", "Stockholm syndrome", "Yuck.\n\nIt does NOT sound like OP is making their child ill to get attention from their mother. You don't even know what the words mean, and are offering a diagnosis?\n\nIt sounds like you have that thing, what's it called...? Oh yeah, bullshit.\n\nOP should get away from their mother for sure. You, on the other hand... yikes.", "Why would you ever even consider putting your child in her house? \nWe probably know of 1/100th of the things she did to you and clearly see how bad a person she is. \nWhy can't you see that?\n\nHave you ever considered going to therapy to teach you how to get away from abusive relationships?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
