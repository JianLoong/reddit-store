It sounds like she is crossing some boundaries and could easily cross more. You should set those boundaries.

There is nothing you can do to change that but is it better or worse for your kid to take away contact? I'm not saying you shouldn't try to move out and get more space and boundaries but all the top comments are that she is abusive and you should leave and go NC.

My concern is that OP gets out, because when B gets older and starts doing the frustrating things that newly mobile babies and toddlers do, I don't think that the Mom is going to be all sunshine and rainbows.

I've seen this in my own family-- that person has never been allowed to meet our son.
