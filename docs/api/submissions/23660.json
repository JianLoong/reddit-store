She's been through things so she doesn't like people going in her room without asking. For example if she comes home and see's an item in her room in a different spot than she left it this can cause great panic in her. We don't go in her room but she has a tendency to keep mugs and cups in her room for days. She'll get a new cup, carry it in her room and eventually there will be like 7 cups on her desk. We used to just walk inside and take them to the dishwasher but now we'll just text her. However letting her know these things can still annoy her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPretty much warning her or doing something for her can cause her stress. I understand she has her issues and I don't want this come off like she is cold and mean. We have a great relationship and we hang out and do things together all the time. She's one of my best friends she just has these spots where she draws the line. If she uses a pan and doesn't wash it and someone else washes it. This will bother her. If we ask her to wash it this will bother her as well. So pretty much I've stopped getting involved in things she is doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEarlier in the week she was making some kind of pork dish in the slow cooker. 8+ hours had passed and she was asleep in her room. Usually she sets alarms for things like this but she must have forgotten. Knowing that anything I do would bother her, I just carried on and eventually went to bed. She woke up in the morning upset and asked me why I didn't wake her up or turn off the slowcooker. I said \"because you'd be upset still.\" Yesterday she was baking something but was in a rush and took it out of the oven and set it on the counter and left the house. I guess she shout she'd be back in time but she was out until the next day and we left those potatoes in the stove all night and until she came back. This bothered her as well. I'm not quite sure how she thinks I am the asshole for following her instructions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT for those saying I put the house at work. It's a slowcooker. I've let broth cook in a slowcooker for much longer than what her pork cooked for.

If so, then NTA.\n\nThe reason I ask is going into her room to collect dirty dishes and turning off food are completely different. However, I also think your sister is using anger along with her anxiety and depression to hold the rest of the family hostage. It\u2019s unfair to you that she leaves dirty dishes and food lying around. She seems to control the shared space in ways that are unfair to the rest of you.", "NTA - It's exhausting to walk on eggshells around someone. In cases like this, you're damned if you and damned if you don't. In this case I probably would have turned it off simply for the safety aspect, but I get why you didn't want to get involved.", "Nta she has mental problems that caused this isdue.  You explained why you ignored the food.  Now ignore her. Her fault.", "I had a roommate who left the oven on all day one time. The oven was on for over 8 hours in an unattended house. The electric bill that month was almost $300. When I confronted her about it she told me I was being dramatic.

I\u2019m sorry she struggles with mental health issues. I know it sucks. But YOU need to set boundaries wirh her. Things you are willing to anccept and things you aren\u2019t willing to accept. \u201cSister you don\u2019t like it if we ignore the situation and you don\u2019t like it if we remind you or try to help. This is unacceptable. You need to decide which bothers you the least and accept it. I will not allow you to burn the house down because you forget your cooking. So how fo you want these situations to go? We need to find a compromise\u201d", "NTA.  Your sister sounds exhausting.  You ask her to take care of something: she's stressed.  You take care of it for her: she's stressed.  Tip-toeing around all of her rules as not to cause her stress is in fact stressful to all of you.   Time for a family meeting.", "NTA. She can't have it all three ways. She needs to figure this out for herself and communicate if she wants you to start warning her in advance and very clearly and unambiguously", "ESH\n\nSince she's going to be upset no matter what you do, I would go the route that doesn't waste food. Is she in therapy? Because it sounds like she needs to be.", "YTA because you put everyone in the house at risk.", "INFO: Is there a reason you couldn't turn it off such as not knowing how?", "YTA\n\nYou knew she forgot to set an alarm, you did something shitty and use the excuse you \u201cknew\u201d she would be upset", "YTA, because you left a cooking appliance on all night. A fire could have started!\n\nI know it's a low chance of that happening with a slow cooker, but there's still a chance.", "ESH. Mental health problems or not, your sister can\u2019t make her shit everyone else\u2019s problem. Especially not to the point that she has. Like y\u2019all can\u2019t even function normally in your home anymore. She can\u2019t create an environment in which every possible helpful course of action is punished and still expect a helping hand. \n\nYou suck because you prioritized her being upset over your house literally burning down. And don\u2019t come in and say \u201cit\u2019s a slow cooker dude\u201d AGAIN like you have to everyone else who has pointed out this fact. Slow cookers can start fires too.", "ESH leaning YTA\n\nYou could banged loudly on her door without going into her room haha.\n\nYou also could have just turned the appliance off, and if it was still edible put it in the refrigerator because not wasting food is an environmental issue and way bigger than just the two of you..", "ESH.

She should get some help and tools for dealing with her mental health issues.\n\nYour household needs to have a conversation about these things. This is a shared living space. I would say something like if someone is cooking and leaves the house or is asleep and others notice that the food is done cooking the expectation is that we will shut it off/store it safely and send you a text letting you know. This applies to everyone in the house.  Maybe some rules about dishes for everyone. Dishes need to be brought to the kitchen once a week to be washed. Pans need to be cleaned the same day. If you want to use the shared dishes they need to be washed in a timely manner to be available to everyone.\n\nI would refuse to not ever upset her about this stuff. Living with other people means you take care of stuff. You don\u2019t let someone\u2019s food get wrecked and you don\u2019t get pissed over people washing a dirty dish you left behind. If she doesn\u2019t like it then she needs to move out.", "Yes. If she has a dirty pan on the stove and I or someelse washes it for her, this upsets her.

So stop giving advice about crock pots.  This is all her sister fault. Sister's mental problems are not OPs responsibility.  OP just did what is normal considering her sisters mental state. Sis need to get help.", "It's a slow cooker dude. I've left them on to make broth for like a whole day before", "Am I the only one who has used slowcookers for like 24 hours to make broth? I swear there are tons of recipes for it online. This is just common practice. She had the slowcooker on the low setting I would use to make broth", "Did you read the post? If I knocked on the door and warned her, she'd be upset. If I turned off the machine, she'd feel upset that I did something to something she was working on. All options would end with her being upset with me so I chose the one with inaction that I could pass of as me just being in my room and not noticing", "My family has used slowcookers for 12 hours or more to make broth for as long as I can remember. If it were an oven or something on the stove or like a toaster oven or something. I'd definitely cut it off", "Wow. It sounds like she expects everyone around her to be a mind reader. She wants you to turn off her food when it suits her, but becomes angry if you don\u2019t do it. How are you to know?\n\nI\u2019m not trained to work with people with mental health problems, but, as I wrote before, her behavior is unfair to the rest of you, and I hope her problems are being addressed.", "These are completely different things.\n\nHer room is her private space. In my room, the physical arrangements of objects has significance: if you move something while I'm out, that's almost the same as you rummaging around inside my brain and moving things about.\n\nThe food she's cooking is a task she's in the middle of. Do you know that the timer meant \"this food is ready now\", and not \"start to think about whether the food is ready\" or something else? If she's not in the kitchen, telling her that her timer is going off should be OK.\n\nBut I don't understand why she'd get upset about you washing up a dirty pan. That's not \"her\" pan, and she's not using it any more.", "So you'd risk setting your damn house on fire??

No electrical device with a heating element should. I'm not judging OP's sister.", "I said it's a low chance, but the risk is still present. It doesn't take a whole lot to short out an electrical circuit, and if it's not a GFCI outlet...", "Someone didn\u2019t watch \u201cThis is Us\u201d\u2026.", "Are the chances small? Yes. Are the chances 0? Absolutely not. People have died in fires started by slow cookers. \n\nThere\u2019s also a bit of a difference between simmering broth, a liquid that would take some effort to set on fire; and meat, which is much more easily set on fire.", "I apologize, I did read those details but I'm saying that you guys suck and/or you're the asshole because you (two) care more about each other's feelings than about the environmental issue of wasting food.\n\nLike not to be rude and it's definitely not meant as an insult because neither of you guys are even 25 yet, but this shows emotional immaturity because things like saving money, saving food/ being environmentally friendly should be prioritized over little things like feelings and nap and sleep cycles and such.\n\nSome advice I have since you seem to maybe be a little conflict avoidant or something otherwise you would continue to press the issue is maybe next time something like this happens if you feel like you would like to save the food, do it but then here's what I would do after:\n\nPhysically write a letter or email or text something so that there's a proof of time sent even if it's just to a different friend or or one of your own accounts so that way when she wakes up you can say here I would like you to read this without getting upset here are the reasons why I did what I did and if you think there's issues with that then you either need to seek more treatment for your mental health issues or be more understanding when I'm trying to help.\n\nSometimes seeing things written down especially when you know they weren't said in reaction to something else can really help overly sensitive people understand the issue with more clarity. Maybe even in the letter or in conversation ask what she would do in a similar situation or what the perfect actions should have been?", "Separately, I would say if your sister doesn't want to seek out medication or therapy or some type of help, you need to give her an ultimatum.\n\nIf she doesn't want you interfering with things like washing pans that you need to use to cook, or stopping food from being wasted then she needs to be the one to invest in appliances that can automatically turn off, and she needs to buy the extra cups and pots and pans so that you guys can have separate ones so that you don't have to break her rules of washing a pan she used but you can still cook yourself dinner.\n\nAlso it sounds like you guys haven't really tried to talk about this with each of you having a pen and paper or something to take notes to show both of each other that you're listening in good faith?", "She got upset because someone else loaded her plate into the dishwasher when she was out of the house before", "Everyone in these replies needs to google \"24 hour slow cooker recipes\" and will quickly realize that hers being on overnight is no big deal.", "My family has used slowcookers to make broth for 12+ hours for as long as I can remember", "Isn't the entire point of slow cookers that you turn them on, and can leave the house and go do whatever? How would leaving it on make that any more unsafe than it normally is?", "Did the plate come from her room, or from the kitchen counter? Was it a special plate that wasn't dishwasher-safe?", "**YOU** need to realize that the risk of fire is still present.", "And I've walked across the street to get the mail a thousand times. It doesn't mean that if I do it tomorrow I *wont* get run over.", "It would depend on the recipe. OP\u2019s comparison to broth is apples and oranges. It would take actual talent to set broth on fire, meat is much easier to burn and cause smoke and fire. \n\nLike I said the chances are pretty damn low with a slow cooker, but they are NOT 0. People have literally died, [you can fact check me on that](https://blog.gitnux.com/slow-cooker-fire-statistics/).", "Just a normal plate that we put in the dishwasher sitting on the kitchen table. I just don't involve myself in things she is doing because she'll get upset", "How is it any more present than the normal usage of a slow cooker?", "So theres a chance of me being struck by lightning when i go outside so should i always be careful and try to hide from the imaginary lightning?", "Recipes and recommended cooking times are determined based on what's being cooked, to include water content of ingredients. If you leave the slow cooker on for longer than the recommended cooking time, then you run the risk of the food drying out and the possibility of a fire if left for too long."]}
