He 100% needed to be removed...but that's the job of the best man and the groomsmen if you don't have security. The father and sisters? A million times more AH than you :P", "NTA. How would he know what a good man is?", "This 100% depends on if your wife thinks you\u2019re an asshole or not. Sure, you could have handled it better, but if she\u2019s happy about how you handled it then you did the right thing.\n\nTwist my arm for a rating and I say NTA", "Not a great way to handle it, but definitely not the worst. You should never have had to be in that position to start with. He wasn't invited. He had no right to be there. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour wife didn't want him there, you made it so he wasn't.", "Info: What was your wife's reaction?", "NTA It is wonderful that you honored your wife's wishes. I am so glad someone stood up for her.", "NTA and the old \"like it or not they are family\" does not mean a damned thing. Someone who does nothing more than contribute half of a person's DNA throughout their childhood has no inherent right to participate in their adult life. This is particularly true when it has been expressly stated that the DNA contributor is not welcome or wanted in the adult child's life. Please keep respecting and honoring your wife's wishes and being a wonderful example of what a good spouse does for their other half. Good luck!", "NTA, she didn't want him there and communicated this very clearly to her half sisters beforehand. They fucked around and found out.", "You're a hero.  NTA.", "NTA , you did what every girl wants their man to do, and thats honor her . He lost his rights the moment he walked away , and just because now he feels like it wants to be part of this beautiful event . The half sister is the one who should be classified as ah, she went and disrespected the wishes of your wife and made her day sad . You in the other hand im sure you became her hero .", "What matters is what your wife thinks. If she feels like you stood up for her, then nothing more needs to be said. \n\nPersonally, I think you're NTA.", "NTA. You are going to be a good husband.", "NTA. Your fiancee didn't want him there. You stood up for her when she needed. Not all heroes wear capes and apparently some show up in a tux. Good on you!", "Nta. But true, you shouldn't make a scene.", "Listen, you\u2019re right. Her dad is and always will be an asshole, but at least he showed up to see his child walk down the aisle to start an entirely new journey with her future: that\u2019s *you*.\n\nRemember, at the end of the day, he may have brought her into the world, and maybe he didn\u2019t love her the way a real parent should, but *you* have a special bond with her that she has only known with you. Her dad missed out on most of her life, and that\u2019s his fault. You will never be able to unbreak the bonds he broke in her childhood, but you can build an entirely new one that is so much stronger.\n\nYour job now is to start a new chapter in life with her and to give her the love and respect that she deserves. If her dad wants to be involved in her life and she wants that or she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s her choice, but you are now her protector and her future, and with you, she won\u2019t ever have feel the pain that he put her through anymore.\n\nIf you kicked him out, it\u2019s too late to turn back now, and no, you\u2019re NTA for it, but you need to let old wounds seal up so that you can make way for a better future.", "This is one of those situations where looking back on it, it would have been nice if they hired security, just in case. But that's easy to say after the fact.", "She wishes I had shown more restraint but she said she understood why I reacted the way I did. After the wedding she told me that she felt safe and loved. I love her so much I would do anything for her.", "This is the only question that really matters. Assuming Wife is ok with it it's clearly NTA.", "I was about to write the same, totally agree. I think NTA too, well done on looking after your wife.", "Hell to the fucking no did you not even read the post? His wife broke down crying at the site of her father. She told her sisters NOT to bring him and they did anyway. Nah OP did exactly what he should have done in that scenario", "I did read it but I missed that part. They shouldn\u2019t have brought him if it hurts her this way, especially on her wedding day. That\u2019s pretty shitty.", "Yeah ok thank god. I was worried you were insane for a second ngl", "Yep. Basically dear old dad had an orgasm. That\u2019s pretty much his sole contribution to \u201cbringing her into this world.\u201d\n\nOP, you are NTA.", "Ohh, nope lol.
