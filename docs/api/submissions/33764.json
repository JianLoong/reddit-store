OP owes nothing to anyone. I wouldn\u2019t dream of buying tickets for everyone without making sure everyone was on board.", "Are you serious?", "NTA but I think its good practice to be generous accomodating small stuff with friends as good will gestures if you can.

Ofcourse, \u00a315 isn't necessary \"small stuff depending on your budget", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe anyone. \n\nNobody reasonable expects someone else to pay for something unless there's a clear understanding that the other person is going to do just that.\n\nYou said you'd already got your ticket.", "NTA\n\nYou should always check before you spend money on someone else's behalf. \n\nWording is also important though, so if the question was 'we are going to watch a movie, want us to get you a ticket ' then the fault for accepting the offer without also specifying that you wouldn't need a ticket is yours. If the question was 'we are going to the cinema, want to come', then the onus would be on them to specify they were buying the tickets.\n\nAnd in any case, the ticket could have been returned as soon as they discovered you wouldn't be needing it, so there shouldn't have been an issue if they were smarter about it.", "ESH: Three parties went into a situation making assumptions regarding everyone else and no one bothered to communicate these facts despite ample opportunity to do so. You have an unusual situation with your subscription and should have told your friend that you had your ticket. Your friend should have told you that their friend was planning on buying the groups tickets, or told their friend they would ask you. Your friends friend should have communicated before buying all of the tickets.  \nYou don't owe them anything but an apology for your contribution to the failure to communicate.", "NTA. Theaters are usually pretty reasonable about giving refunds for this kind of thing.

OP is not required to check in to make sure another party isn't a moron.", "By that logic, the guy should eat the 14.50 as a lesson to not assume obligations for others in the future.
