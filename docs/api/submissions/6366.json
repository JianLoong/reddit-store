He's expecting you to suffer so he doesn't have to. Unless you can sleep in separate rooms it's not healthy to go on like this. He should probably also see a doctor to rule out any medical reasons for the snoring", "NTA. My boyfriends snoring has recently gotten really bad so I went to sleep on the couch the other night.  He immediately felt so guilty. He told me I should have woken him up but I said I felt bad. He said he will do whatever it takes to stop the snoring. He reached out to his mom who uses a machine at night and started googling what he can do. \nIf he knows his snoring is a problem he should be doing his due diligence to rectify the situation.", "NTA. If his snoring is so bad that you cannot sleep than communicate it. Talk about possibilities how to minimize his snoring and at first to find out where his snoring comes from. It is definitely not cool to kept awake because of his snoring but waking him up everytime he snores is not a solution either. \nJust talk about it and find a solution together", "NTA - He should be reasonable and love you enough to realize that him snoring is his problem, not yours.\nYou can easily get rid of the snoring by getting rid of him, therefore he should consider treating the snoring before its too late to save the relationship.\n\nBtw - He might not realize it, but snoring can cause health problems / is caused by health problems. It would not only be better for your relationship, but also for his health, to treat it soon.\n\nI hope he only lashed out because he was grumpy due to the lack of sleep and makes it up to you and tells you that he's sorry for his behaviour.", "NTA, and this level of snoring is not good for his and your health.\n\nHe really should get checked for sleep apnea. It isn't as simple as just being a noisy sleeper, but sleep apnea increases your risk of cardiac arrest amongst other health issues. I bet he also doesn't feel rested in the morning despite a full night of sleep. When you have sleep apnea your quality of sleep is actually very poor. Either way, get him to get checked out!", "NTA, I've been where you are. SO many times I have ended up on my sofa because of my husband's snoring, been exhausted for days on end due to lack of sleep. It starts to affect physical and mental health.\n\nI understand it is frustrating for him to be repeatedly woken up. In his mind it is a choice you are making when you could let him sleep. What he's not putting together is the fact that YOU are being repeatedly woken up. It can't be essential that he is allowed to sleep peacefully, but not you.\n\nIs he overweight? Does he drink too much? If so, these can be contributing factors that should be addressed. In the short term, he needs to be willing to try something like breathe right strips. You could also try silicone earplugs. Otherwise he needs to go home until this can be resolved.\n\nIn the longer term, he needs to deal with the issue. See a doctor for sleep apnea. It may be a medical issue, but if so he needs to actually address it. This is a relationship killer if unresolved.", "If it is that loud, I think he should be looking into ways to clear his airways, there are plasters that help in keeping the nostrils open, sprays, etc. You should also look into earplugs, there are some that don't block sounds totally, but rather contain the noise, they maybe useful to keep sleeping, but still let you hear your allarm clock in the morning. Remember it's you two against the problem, not against one another.", "NTA. I was your bf at one time. I kept waking my husband by snoring and while it was annoying to be woken up by him to roll over (I was comfy) I decided to figure out why I was snoring and do what I could to fix it.

I feel awful that it wakes my partner up so I told him to make sure he wakes me up so I can turn over or move. \n\nI get that it is annoying for him to be woken up but what does he expect? you to just lie there awake with him snoring in your ear. \n\nIf it helps we found a combination of me sleeping with an extra pillow to relieve some of the snoring (snore strips don't work for me) and him wearing soft ear plugs to bed, has really helped and now we both sleep through most nights.", "NTA\nI'm in a similar situation and as much as I love my husband and enjoy spending time with him, I was not sorry to have a quiet night after he left again on Sunday.\nHe's (bf) an asshole for thinking that he deserves uninterrupted sleep but you have to put up with his snoring.\nI also recommend loop earplugs.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think anyone is an AH in this situation. Obviously he isn\u2019t trying to snore and it\u2019s annoying to be woken up multiple times in the night, but the exact same thing goes for you.

Can you live with same argument for the next year? 5 years? 10? \n\nI've been dealing with a snorer for 20 years and it's only gotten worse as we age. Even when we share a bed we have to sleep with our heads at opposite ends of the bed, but bedsharing is a thing of the past. We can't go on vacations that involve single rooms. I have had literal breakdowns in the middle of the night due to the ceaseless noise. Noise so loud even the kids need white noise to drown him out on another floor of the house.\n\n We have had years of arguments because if \nhis snoring doesn't wake him up it's not a problem. He has been salty for years because He feels like I should make the effort to deal with the snoring. But the chronic lack of sleep has caused depression, anxiety, mental fog, tanked my libido to non existence. I've been on a regime of drugs to manage all the symptoms  my husband's snoring has brought on.", "NTA. I dealt with my husband's abominable snoring for years.  I begged him to see a doctor,  but he always put it off. Meanwhile,  I was suffering because I wasn't getting anywhere near enough sleep.  In the end,  I gave him an ultimatum.  Get it checked out and dealt with by medical professionals, or I'm moving out.  He grumbled and complained and said I was being unfair,  but he loves me, so if he went to get a sleep study done.  He has severe sleep apnea. Life threatening,  especially as he's overweight and has a family history of heart disease.  He was shocked to the core, especially when the doctor told him my demands  saved his life.  He has a cpap machine now and is no longer at high risk of the sleep apnea causing a heart attack and killing him in his sleep. In  no way are you the arsehole,  and your partner needs to fix the issue before it threatens his life, too.", "Hmmm tough one but I feel like NAH.

If the snoring is bad -and until my SO decides to finally do a sleep study/see ENT- he sleeps in the other room or a sofa. NTA", "NAH you're both grumpy because your sleep is being disrupted. It's nobody's fault. You now know that nudging him awake bothers him , or maybe after staying together for longer than you're used to being together it's starting to bother him , so you're going to have to figure out a new strategy together. But it makes sense that in the middle of the night isn't the easiest time to do that. Lots of couples don't sleep together because of things like snoring. Earplugs can go a long way towards eliminating that sound. There might be interventions he can take to reduce this time, but he can certainly learn to sleep facing away from you. I hope you can sleep some more, and when you're both rested I hope you are able to find a good resolution", "NTA. You have written my life story. I wake my husband up about 3-5 times a night and tell him to roll on to his side. He accepts this is his problem and is pretty compliant. In his case, he snores when he is unfit /carrying weight so I don\u2019t feel in the least bit guilty because he knows what he needs to do. Two suggestions: \n1) record the snoring on your phone. My husband didn\u2019t believe how bad it was until I started doing this. He was actually shocked and apologetic once I did this. Had to do it a few times to make my case. \n2) buy yourself a good pair of earplugs. I like Queies Foam the most\n\nHe needs to pay attention. This is not your problem- its his.", "NTA\n\nHis snoring is an issue he has to deal with.  He is waking you up.  Neither one of you are sleeping.  \n\nTry earplugs and a sound machine.  \n\nMy boyfriend used to tape something to his left arm so he wouldn't roll over onto that side and snore in my face.", "ESH two people who don't communicate well. You are both adults and know that he snores and you are a light sleeper. You say you've been dating a few YEARS so how do you not have a battle plan down for sleeping?", "ESH, though him only mildly.\n\nYou need your sleep. If you've made him aware in the past that his snoring is an issue for you, he should be assessed at least to see if any of it can be addressed. If he hasn't had it checked out to see if there is a larger problem or if something could be helped, that is on him, but it is the only part that makes him at all the ah.\n\nThat said, you're treating snoring like it's a behavioral thing, which it very much isn't. It's nearly always related to either medical things or structural abnormalities, sometimes serious, sometimes minor. I myself snore (fairly quietly I'm told) depending on my body/face position due to structural issues in my sinuses, which I've already had surgery on to address what they could (not for the snoring, but for other related problems 2 birds). It's not harmful, and there is nothing more I can do about it, as I move in my sleep, so I can't guarantee I won't move into a position I will snore.\n\nIf his snoring is caused by something that can be reasonably addressed, he should do so, especially if it's something potentially dangerous like sleep apnea, though I must point out that often involves using noisy machinery during sleep.\n\n However, if his issue is something like mine, where there is nothing that really can/should be done, and you're picking at him, that would be straight out mean on your part. \n\nTalk with him about this when you're both awake, and ask if he has been checked out by a medical professional. If there is something that should be addressed, it is reasonable for you to ask that he do so. If there is nothing he can reasonably address, though, you need to make the decision on whether you want to sleep with the man as is or break up, but you can't be mean to him about something he can't fix.", "I\u2019m surprised at how many people are not aware that snoring is involuntary.

You need to decide if this is a hard line or not in regards to loving him.", "NTA. Snorers just shouldn't sleep in the same room. It is unpractical and stupid. You needn't share a bedroom in order to \"prove\" that you love each other.", "NTA, but I\u2019d get sneaky to avoid the row, rather than talking I\u2019d nudge gently til he rolls over or wakes just enough to stop snoring. There are little pressure point rings to wear if he can\u2019t roll, or get some ear plugs. Don\u2019t let snoring cause issues for you both.", "Video it, and show him the next morning. \n\nI never snored in my life, but then one of the meds I started taking had that side effect. \n\nHonestly it took me ages to believe how bad it was - mostly because I didn\u2019t want to believe it. \n\nHave the conversation during the day sometime when you\u2019re not both sleep deprived. You\u2019re definitely NTA and he\u2019s completely in the wrong - but we\u2019re not always rational in the middle of the night being abruptly woken up.", "Living with my BF for 10 years. We sleep in different rooms. Happy live happy sleeps. Makes living together more easy. I first also woke him up when he started to snore but but he would fall asleep again and start again. Well our current solution works out.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend wants to be able to sleep, but doesn't care if you can't sleep. \n\nYou should suggest that he have a sleep study. I used to snore so badly that my spouse had difficulty sleeping. A sleep study showed that I have severe obstructive sleep apnea, which can have serious health consequences. I now use a CPAP machine, which eliminated my snoring entirely. Both my spouse and I sleep much better now.", "NTA, I wake my husband up when he snores and tell him to shift. It's always a certain position that makes him snow. So it's easy to just do a quick nudge and say roll over before i gets horrendous. I am a light sleeper and the beginning of his snoring usuallywakes me. . He accepts it.", "Sleep study time! He MIGHT need a CPAP, but there could be other stuff he can discuss with his doc. I snored really badly and came to find out that I was also not breathing quite often during the night, putting more stress on my heart and not getting good sleep at all, feeling tired during the day, etc. It can really help.", "Tell him to talk to his family dr and get tested for sleep apnea.", "If it's that loud he needs a sleep study, full stop. It needs to be checked to see if the snoring is a symptom of sleep apnea or not.", "no AH = NAH", "Thank you ! I will suggest this to him !", "That's so unspeakably selfish of him. I'm sorry.", "NTA. Does he have the ability to have a sleep study done? If there\u2019s a medical reason, that means he needs to seek out help, not expect you to just deal with it. Neither of you should be waking the other up all the time.", "buy another bed", "NTA. That's an overblown reaction! I gently nudge my snorer, and they move \u2014 no discussion needed, and they rarely even recall the event in the morning.", "My Mom used to be like: \"Stop snoring\", and my Dad would stop, even though he was still asleep. Lol It was wild. \n\nTheir relationship sucked otherwise, but he at least listened in his sleep lol \n\nAnyways, my husband just did a sleep study to test for sleep apnea. Def not necessary, but it doesn't hurt to test for it and it was really easy. Took home a small machine that strapped to his chest and had a little tube that monitored his breathing, like one of those that slightly goes into your nostrils that they would use in the hospital. Took 4 hours of a (broken sleep due to our dogs getting up a couple times, which was fine, and accounted for) sample and he returned it the next day. It was dope.", "NTA but ask if he remembers all these convos. If all he consistently does is groan and roll over he might not be aware of how much its happening. I know that I'm such a hard sleeper people have to be triple sure I'm away when I'm talking with them because I can (and have) cancelled plans or confirmed plans and had literally no memory of the combos at all. \n\nWhile he obviously has to remember some (like when he's in the living room) he might not be aware its happening as much as it does", "NTA. I gained weight during the pandemic and started to snore. My GF nudged me awake all the time. While it wasn't pleasant for me, it was much worse for her (I've since lost the weight and the snoring has decreased dramatically). \n\nHe likely has untreated sleep apnea--it's his responsibility to look into solutions. While snoring isn't \"his fault,\" you shouldn't be the one who suffers for it. NTA", "NTA\n\nSpeaking as a snorer who was often woken by his wife.\n\nI didn't even care if she kicked me or elbowed me,  because I understand the root cause was ME disturbing HER sleep.\n\nI did draw the line at being hit over the head with a pillow, which sounds insignificant,  but left me with a head ache all day.", "Somepeople sleep in separate rooms for this reason. NTA. If you love eachother youll finger it out.", "NTA it always seems like the snorer is the usually the one who acts like they\u2019re the one being victimized \u2014 he\u2019s the one causing problems. He needs to get that checked out. Next time, he gets the sofa.", "NTA - Snoring boyfriend here, maybe I can help a bit with this situation:\n\nI\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for 5 years now, and whenever we sleep together my snoring can get weirdly loud and she\u2019ll easily be woken up. I believe the first thing that you should address with your SO is the fact that snoring is a problem he is causing - despite any medical conditions he may have (it is worth nothing that he should get himself checked out! Sleep amnea is a real issue, but it is possible that the snoring will not go away regardless), and it is heavily impacting your quality of life. On the other hand, you should also understand that this is a problem that he has little to no control on. In other words, the solution is to find a way to best accommodate both parties, and no one should be put to blame over the issue. \n\nNow, on to the practical stuff, here\u2019s some stuff that has helped us over the years:\n\n- I sleep on my side rather than face up. I tend to snore the loudest face up, and sleeping on my side will often quite the sound by a big margin. What also helps to stay on my side is to tug a pillow between my legs, it will prevent me from trying to re-accommodate while asleep. \n\n- My SO will sometimes try to roll me over while asleep, and, if I\u2019m too loud, will even wake me up with a nudge. Here I\u2019ll just try to stay awake for 10-20 minutes to let her get back to sleeping, and then I\u2019ll go back to sleeping too.\n\n- if none of the above work, ear plugs are a great option! I\u2019ve had some friends over who wear them due to street noice at their place and my snoring was never an issue for them. Not everyone finds them comfortable though, so they may not be your best fit. You can pick up some cheap ones at Amazon, and they have a wide variety of sound reduction levels so you can still be aware of your surroundings. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that I\u2019m a very heavy sleeper, so waking up multiple times during the night does not bother me. I hope you found some of this helpful :)", "YTA, earplugs exist.", "HAHAHA ummm he did it first? Where does he get off thinking it\u2019s ok to wake YOU up??", "NTA\n\nHe should look into a sleep study. He might have sleep apnea", "NAH\n\nI think being woken up several times a night turns everybody into berserks. That means you as well as him. \n\nOf course he is the snoring culprit, but that doesn't change he has been woken up. \n\nTalk to him that he has to get his reactions under control at night or remain in the living room if it's a snoory night.", "NTA. If he is frequently tired during the day get him evaluated for sleep apnea. The main symptoms are fatigue and loud snoring. With a cpap machine he will be well rested and quiet at night.", "NTA my husband snores too and we tend to sleep in separate rooms more often than not. I'm a light sleeper and if he wakes me within 30 mins of first falling asleep then I can struggle to fall asleep again for hours. Since we've got small children and I don't get the opportunity to lie in or nap I can get really stressed about it. \n\nOne thing we have tried is an acupressure ring which does help to some extent but not so much if he's congested with a cold. Might be worth a try?", "I guess this is an unpopular opinion, but Y kinda are TA.\n\nSleep deprivation is very serious. It sucks that you\u2019re experiencing it because of his snoring, but it\u2019s not nice of you to wake him up every time he does it. Why should he also have to suffer? The snoring is probably something he\u2019s ashamed of and not something he can really help (there is maybe some kind of surgery but if you\u2019re in the US it\u2019s probably unaffordable). Instead of letting this constantly be an issue between you, I suggest you find a permanent solution for not having to sleep in the same room anymore. Ever. Otherwise you\u2019ll both just resent each other. This will increase over time.", "People can have a hard time being decent human beings when woken.\n\n\nDoesn't change that you have every ridge to wake him to roll over when he snores at you. NTA.", "NTA. I'm surprised none of the comments I've seen have mentioned sleep apnea. My dad has had it forever and the snoring is ridiculously loud. Does he hit a hard wall in the afternoon and **needs** a nap no matter what? Like clockwork sometime 3:30-4pm my dad would sleep, almost narcoleptic-like. Doesn't matter if he's driving, evergy drinks, coffee, etc. He'd need to take a nap right then or basically pass out. He wasn't getting any complete sleep. \n\nHave you ever noticed him stop suddenly and take a deep breath and continue sleeping (with or without snoring)? That is his brain waking him up enough to not suffocate in his sleep. Ask him to get a sleep study done to see if there is something medically wrong. Sleep apnea keeps you in limbo sleep where you aren't getting into deep or REM stages, the most important ones. When my dad went to the study they woke him up because he stopped breathing for almost a minute at a time, 60-100 times. They asked how his sleep was going, \"I'm sleeping like a log, one of my better ones this week.\" They got him a CPAP machine which is basically just a wind tunnel that forces the flap that causes snoring(and sleep apnea suffocating) open. It's not comfortable, and takes some getting used to, but it's the only way my dad can get any restful sleep. They also make less intrusive/loud versions now.", "NTA.\nMy husband snores unbearably.  Know what he tells me? Punch me if you have to so I roll over so you can sleep.\nHe knows I'm a light sleeper, I know he can't help the snoring. That attitude of someone basically kicking you out of your own bed is unfucking unacceptable .", "NTA, dude should do a sleep study because this isn't sustainable for either of you if you did end up moving in together.", "NTA my mom couldn\u2019t take my dads snoring, he went in and they told him his sleep apnea was so bad he could fall asleep one night and not wake up. He will be thanking you when he can still breathe in the morning even if he can\u2019t see that rn, I\u2019m sorry sleep deprivation makes you go crazy and isn\u2019t anything you can control or do to make yourself NOT need restful sleep. Maybe together invest in a pull out couch ?", "ESH. It's not something he can control. He is not doing it maliciously. Waking him is not a solution. You'll need to find a solution to his medical problems. \n\nHe probably needs to lose weight, do lung exercises and use nasal strips.\n\nYou need to find earplugs and maybe even sleep in separate beds till his snoring gets better.", "THIS. My husband's snoring is really bad, but he only went to see a doctor after he'd been so tired he almost dropped one of our twin babies from his arms sitting up, and after I'd told him he stopped breathing several times a night!\n\nDiagnosis: severe sleep apnoea. He stopped breathing about 20 times a night for over half a minute, and he was so tired because his body HAD to wake him up halfway to save him from suffocating. \nHis doctor compared him driving a car as tired as he was with driving under the influence for months.\n\nNow he's got a breathing machine, which is loud, too, but not as loud as the snoring, and at least I know he'll wake up in the morning!", "Similar here. I complained over 1 year, almost every night I shook him and I got really pissed off during the night because of his snorring. Last straw of me: I moved into the guest room. He realized, that I am serious, that I am not coming back in our bed, unless he does something against it (previously he told me \"I cant do anything against it\" \"stripes dont wotl - its just money-making for the company\"). After a couple of weeks, he had an appointment at the sleep-research-center to get checked out. NTA", "This is on him to fix - he\u2019s the one with the problem interrupting her sleep, and he shouldn\u2019t get grumpy that he\u2019s now also getting woken up.", "Yep, when my ex groused about me wanting to sleep apart I recorded his snoring and showed him how unbelievably loud it was.", "Have you ever tried to sleep with earplugs? It\u2019s a miserable experience. I think OP just needs her own bedroom.", "You listed steps he can take to reduce/eliminate snoring sooo it DOES seem to be quite able to be controlled.", "You're lucky, my parents went through the same thing when I was a kid and my dad straight up refused to do anything about it. He also didn't give a crap when my mum moved permanently to my old room after I left. Nor when she slept on the sofa multiple nights before there was a spare room. He never once offered to take the couch and said no when she begged.", "This is so accurate.  I was a terrible snorer.  Was always tired.  Turned out that after I had a sleep study, I had very bad sleep apnea.  It raises your blood pressure if you are not breathing properly, and snoring is indicative.  Now, I use a CPAP machine some nights, plus I've lost weight and my wife says I almost never snore any longer.  I wake up refreshed too.  OP needs to have her boyfriend get a sleep study.  It could save his life.", "Yes, I sleep with earplugs half of the time because sounds annoy me when I'm trying to sleep. It's not so bad when you get used to it.", "It's something he can work towards fixing he can't just stop snoring cause she woke him up. That's why ESH she is an AH for waking him which is not a helpful solution and he is AH for not taking active steps.", "More common issues that may cause (or aggravate) snoring\n\nBeing overweight\nBeing intoxicated \n\nWorth resolving these before looking for expensive medical solutions", "Also, you can try using earplugs\u2026 and/or putting a pillow between you, so he\u2019s snoring into that.", "My husband is having his second sleep study to determine if he needs a CPAP. He was diagnosed with it the first time but he couldn't afford the mouth guard they wanted him to get as insurance wouldn't cover it.", "What do you suggest she do??", "Yeah he\u2019s definitely not overweight but we were drinking that night haha. Not to the point of intoxication. A couple of beers. We can see how he is when we\u2019re not drinking \ud83d\ude01", "Wow so many suggestions thank you so much !", "Use construction communication. use earplugs or sleep in a separate bed till the issue is resolved.
