He's expecting you to suffer so he doesn't have to. Unless you can sleep in separate rooms it's not healthy to go on like this. He should probably also see a doctor to rule out any medical reasons for the snoring", "NTA. My boyfriends snoring has recently gotten really bad so I went to sleep on the couch the other night.  He immediately felt so guilty. He told me I should have woken him up but I said I felt bad. He said he will do whatever it takes to stop the snoring. He reached out to his mom who uses a machine at night and started googling what he can do. \nIf he knows his snoring is a problem he should be doing his due diligence to rectify the situation.", "NTA. If his snoring is so bad that you cannot sleep than communicate it. Talk about possibilities how to minimize his snoring and at first to find out where his snoring comes from. It is definitely not cool to kept awake because of his snoring but waking him up everytime he snores is not a solution either. \nJust talk about it and find a solution together", "NTA - He should be reasonable and love you enough to realize that him snoring is his problem, not yours.\nYou can easily get rid of the snoring by getting rid of him, therefore he should consider treating the snoring before its too late to save the relationship.\n\nBtw - He might not realize it, but snoring can cause health problems / is caused by health problems. It would not only be better for your relationship, but also for his health, to treat it soon.\n\nI hope he only lashed out because he was grumpy due to the lack of sleep and makes it up to you and tells you that he's sorry for his behaviour.", "NTA, and this level of snoring is not good for his and your health.\n\nHe really should get checked for sleep apnea. It isn't as simple as just being a noisy sleeper, but sleep apnea increases your risk of cardiac arrest amongst other health issues. I bet he also doesn't feel rested in the morning despite a full night of sleep. When you have sleep apnea your quality of sleep is actually very poor. Either way, get him to get checked out!", "NTA, I've been where you are. SO many times I have ended up on my sofa because of my husband's snoring, been exhausted for days on end due to lack of sleep. It starts to affect physical and mental health.\n\nI understand it is frustrating for him to be repeatedly woken up. In his mind it is a choice you are making when you could let him sleep. What he's not putting together is the fact that YOU are being repeatedly woken up. It can't be essential that he is allowed to sleep peacefully, but not you.\n\nIs he overweight? Does he drink too much? If so, these can be contributing factors that should be addressed. In the short term, he needs to be willing to try something like breathe right strips. You could also try silicone earplugs. Otherwise he needs to go home until this can be resolved.\n\nIn the longer term, he needs to deal with the issue. See a doctor for sleep apnea. It may be a medical issue, but if so he needs to actually address it. This is a relationship killer if unresolved.", "If it is that loud, I think he should be looking into ways to clear his airways, there are plasters that help in keeping the nostrils open, sprays, etc. You should also look into earplugs, there are some that don't block sounds totally, but rather contain the noise, they maybe useful to keep sleeping, but still let you hear your allarm clock in the morning. Remember it's you two against the problem, not against one another.", "NTA. I was your bf at one time. I kept waking my husband by snoring and while it was annoying to be woken up by him to roll over (I was comfy) I decided to figure out why I was snoring and do what I could to fix it.

I feel awful that it wakes my partner up so I told him to make sure he wakes me up so I can turn over or move. \n\nI get that it is annoying for him to be woken up but what does he expect? you to just lie there awake with him snoring in your ear. \n\nIf it helps we found a combination of me sleeping with an extra pillow to relieve some of the snoring (snore strips don't work for me) and him wearing soft ear plugs to bed, has really helped and now we both sleep through most nights.", "NTA\nI'm in a similar situation and as much as I love my husband and enjoy spending time with him, I was not sorry to have a quiet night after he left again on Sunday.\nHe's (bf) an asshole for thinking that he deserves uninterrupted sleep but you have to put up with his snoring.\nI also recommend loop earplugs.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think anyone is an AH in this situation. Obviously he isn\u2019t trying to snore and it\u2019s annoying to be woken up multiple times in the night, but the exact same thing goes for you.

Can you live with same argument for the next year? 5 years? 10? \n\nI've been dealing with a snorer for 20 years and it's only gotten worse as we age. Even when we share a bed we have to sleep with our heads at opposite ends of the bed, but bedsharing is a thing of the past. We can't go on vacations that involve single rooms. I have had literal breakdowns in the middle of the night due to the ceaseless noise. Noise so loud even the kids need white noise to drown him out on another floor of the house.\n\n We have had years of arguments because if \nhis snoring doesn't wake him up it's not a problem. He has been salty for years because He feels like I should make the effort to deal with the snoring. But the chronic lack of sleep has caused depression, anxiety, mental fog, tanked my libido to non existence. I've been on a regime of drugs to manage all the symptoms  my husband's snoring has brought on.", "NTA. I dealt with my husband's abominable snoring for years.  I begged him to see a doctor,  but he always put it off. Meanwhile,  I was suffering because I wasn't getting anywhere near enough sleep.  In the end,  I gave him an ultimatum.  Get it checked out and dealt with by medical professionals, or I'm moving out.  He grumbled and complained and said I was being unfair,  but he loves me, so if he went to get a sleep study done.  He has severe sleep apnea. Life threatening,  especially as he's overweight and has a family history of heart disease.  He was shocked to the core, especially when the doctor told him my demands  saved his life.  He has a cpap machine now and is no longer at high risk of the sleep apnea causing a heart attack and killing him in his sleep. In  no way are you the arsehole,  and your partner needs to fix the issue before it threatens his life, too.", "Hmmm tough one but I feel like NAH.

If the snoring is bad -and until my SO decides to finally do a sleep study/see ENT- he sleeps in the other room or a sofa. NTA", "NAH you're both grumpy because your sleep is being disrupted. It's nobody's fault. You now know that nudging him awake bothers him , or maybe after staying together for longer than you're used to being together it's starting to bother him , so you're going to have to figure out a new strategy together. But it makes sense that in the middle of the night isn't the easiest time to do that. Lots of couples don't sleep together because of things like snoring. Earplugs can go a long way towards eliminating that sound. There might be interventions he can take to reduce this time, but he can certainly learn to sleep facing away from you. I hope you can sleep some more, and when you're both rested I hope you are able to find a good resolution", "NTA. You have written my life story. I wake my husband up about 3-5 times a night and tell him to roll on to his side. He accepts this is his problem and is pretty compliant. In his case, he snores when he is unfit /carrying weight so I don\u2019t feel in the least bit guilty because he knows what he needs to do. Two suggestions: \n1) record the snoring on your phone. My husband didn\u2019t believe how bad it was until I started doing this. He was actually shocked and apologetic once I did this. Had to do it a few times to make my case. \n2) buy yourself a good pair of earplugs. I like Queies Foam the most\n\nHe needs to pay attention. This is not your problem- its his.", "NTA\n\nHis snoring is an issue he has to deal with.  He is waking you up.  Neither one of you are sleeping.  \n\nTry earplugs and a sound machine.  \n\nMy boyfriend used to tape something to his left arm so he wouldn't roll over onto that side and snore in my face.", "ESH two people who don't communicate well. You are both adults and know that he snores and you are a light sleeper. You say you've been dating a few YEARS so how do you not have a battle plan down for sleeping?", "ESH, though him only mildly.\n\nYou need your sleep. If you've made him aware in the past that his snoring is an issue for you, he should be assessed at least to see if any of it can be addressed. If he hasn't had it checked out to see if there is a larger problem or if something could be helped, that is on him, but it is the only part that makes him at all the ah.\n\nThat said, you're treating snoring like it's a behavioral thing, which it very much isn't. It's nearly always related to either medical things or structural abnormalities, sometimes serious, sometimes minor. I myself snore (fairly quietly I'm told) depending on my body/face position due to structural issues in my sinuses, which I've already had surgery on to address what they could (not for the snoring, but for other related problems 2 birds). It's not harmful, and there is nothing more I can do about it, as I move in my sleep, so I can't guarantee I won't move into a position I will snore.\n\nIf his snoring is caused by something that can be reasonably addressed, he should do so, especially if it's something potentially dangerous like sleep apnea, though I must point out that often involves using noisy machinery during sleep.\n\n However, if his issue is something like mine, where there is nothing that really can/should be done, and you're picking at him, that would be straight out mean on your part. \n\nTalk with him about this when you're both awake, and ask if he has been checked out by a medical professional. If there is something that should be addressed, it is reasonable for you to ask that he do so. If there is nothing he can reasonably address, though, you need to make the decision on whether you want to sleep with the man as is or break up, but you can't be mean to him about something he can't fix.", "I\u2019m surprised at how many people are not aware that snoring is involuntary.

You need to decide if this is a hard line or not in regards to loving him.", "NTA. Snorers just shouldn't sleep in the same room. It is unpractical and stupid. You needn't share a bedroom in order to \"prove\" that you love each other.", "NTA, but I\u2019d get sneaky to avoid the row, rather than talking I\u2019d nudge gently til he rolls over or wakes just enough to stop snoring. There are little pressure point rings to wear if he can\u2019t roll, or get some ear plugs. Don\u2019t let snoring cause issues for you both.", "Video it, and show him the next morning. \n\nI never snored in my life, but then one of the meds I started taking had that side effect. \n\nHonestly it took me ages to believe how bad it was - mostly because I didn\u2019t want to believe it. \n\nHave the conversation during the day sometime when you\u2019re not both sleep deprived. You\u2019re definitely NTA and he\u2019s completely in the wrong - but we\u2019re not always rational in the middle of the night being abruptly woken up.", "Living with my BF for 10 years. We sleep in different rooms. Happy live happy sleeps. Makes living together more easy. I first also woke him up when he started to snore but but he would fall asleep again and start again. Well our current solution works out.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend wants to be able to sleep, but doesn't care if you can't sleep. \n\nYou should suggest that he have a sleep study. I used to snore so badly that my spouse had difficulty sleeping. A sleep study showed that I have severe obstructive sleep apnea, which can have serious health consequences. I now use a CPAP machine, which eliminated my snoring entirely. Both my spouse and I sleep much better now.", "NTA, I wake my husband up when he snores and tell him to shift. It's always a certain position that makes him snow. So it's easy to just do a quick nudge and say roll over before i gets horrendous. I am a light sleeper and the beginning of his snoring usuallywakes me. . He accepts it.", "Sleep study time! He MIGHT need a CPAP, but there could be other stuff he can discuss with his doc. I snored really badly and came to find out that I was also not breathing quite often during the night, putting more stress on my heart and not getting good sleep at all, feeling tired during the day, etc. It can really help.", "Tell him to talk to his family dr and get tested for sleep apnea.", "If it's that loud he needs a sleep study, full stop. It needs to be checked to see if the snoring is a symptom of sleep apnea or not.", "no AH = NAH", "Thank you ! I will suggest this to him !", "That's so unspeakably selfish of him. I'm sorry."]}
