You made everyone aware there was meat in the chili. Jill ate it anyway. I don\u2019t know what else you were supposed to do. And I don\u2019t know how you could get through three bowls without realizing it\u2019s got meat!\n\nBTW, the chili must be good. I want the recipe!", "NTA as you said you specifically told Jill that your chili had meat in it.\n\nYou might want to ask Jill her opinion in the situation as her involvement, as you tell it, seems to end with eating the chili and that's pretty weird.", "NTA. You told your coworker it wasn't vegan so that was on her to still eat the chili. She isn't a 5 year old that has to be told not to do something. You pre warned her and she still ate it. Your boss is also an asshole for wanting to write you up. You didn't make your coworker do anything.", "NTA and how TF is this culminating in a write up?  Jill was warned it was not vegan. JILL stuffed three bowls in her face, on her own. You don't mention her getting sick from consuming meat.  Usually if a long time vegan ingests animal protein they get sick.  I wonder if Jill isn't as strict a vegan as she purports herself to be....", "NTA\n\nSounds like Jill isn't as confirmed a vegan as you thought. Perhaps her gf is pushing it on her. Nonetheless she has free agency, she knew the chili contained meat and she chose to eat it - three bowls full!", "INFO: I feel like there's information missing from this story. Was all the food that was brought in vegan? Was there any indication yours had meat in it? What does \"pushing my beliefs\" mean? \n\nIt does feel like a ridiculous work environment where people are getting reamed out over something like this and that's why I feel like this is incomplete.", "NTA, you informed everyone ahead of time that the chili contained meat. Sounds to me like Jill wanted it and is trying to use you as a scapegoat. It\u2019s not your job to make sure adults know what they are or aren\u2019t eating. Especially after being informed of the ingredients ahead of time.", "Dafuq? No. \n\nDid anybody else bring non vegan foods to the potluck? Were they written up for attempting to force her to eat them? Was it advertised as a vegan potluck for Jill's sake? I'm trying to figure out how this is on you. \n\nNTA for bringing a dish that you clearly identified as having meat in it and not babysitting her to stop her from eating it.", "NTA\n\nI'm vegan and I find their behaviour very odd. If you told her it's not vegan and she still ate it, there's not much else you can do. The only thing I can think of is maybe she misheard you saying \"it's not vegan\" and thought you said \"it's vegan\" in which case you could have told her before she got to her third bowl but it's still on her to be aware of what she's eating and that isn't your responsibility.", "NTA-  now for next time\u2026.I would not participate in the potluck or I would post a very big sign in front of my dish stating the ingredients", "Info needed: \n\nIs everyone else in your company vegan? Why were you the only one that brought a non-vegan item? \n\nIs your boss her dad or some sort of relative to Jill? By your explanation it sounds like the girlfriend and your boss are trying to force Jill to be vegan.", "NTA. I suspect Jill is mainly vegan to keep peace at home. \n\nThis reminds me of my husband\u2019s old workplace. He was a supervisor and occasionally asked me to make a pan of brownies or sweets and a tray of fruit for him to take in and treat his crew. I was happy to do so. One of the crew members was notorious for rushing to the table for sweets.  The guy never touched the fruit. Everyone laughed about it. Turned out his wife insisted on a super healthy household: vegan, no white sugar, no white flour, etc. At work was his escape to eat whatever he wanted.", "NTA you warned her and she still choose to eat it. Maybe she should rethink her belief if she choose to eat 3 bowls.

Must have been amazing stuff to get a hardcore vegan to eat three bowls of it. Hats off to you.", "NTA. You informed her that it wasn\u2019t vegan, she made the choice to eat multiple bowls.

Head her off at the pass? Erect a 'no Jill zone' around the pot of chili?", "NTA. Absolutely not.", "NTA you stated it was non-vegan.", "NTA...can I have your chili recipe though? If a vegan will eat 3 bowls of it at a potluck, I gotta try it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReport this to HR.", "NTA\n\nJill was clearly in the wrong, however it might be best to offer an apology for the miscommunication for the sake of your job.

I'm vegan and if someone told me a dish had meat in it I would NOT fucking eat it. Is she a fake \"trendy\" vegan or just a complete idiot?", "NTA- how many vegetarians & vegans do you work with? Perhaps next time put the non-vegan/vegetarian dishes on one table and/or labeled. That way no one can blame you for miscommunication. Was she sick to her stomach after eating meat?", "I\u2019m curious\u2026 how did Jill react after all this? Lol", "If your boss continues to push the issue, you could always take his concerns at face value. What would he like you to do in the event you see Jill eating meat again? Wrestle it away from her? Tackle her to the ground? Call the vegan police and have her license revoked? Since you don't want to be a troublemaker, ask him what specific actions he's asking you to take in order to control the eating choices of a grown woman you barely know.\n\nNTA, of course, and while I don't seriously recommend you say any of this, sometimes people don't realize what they're asking unless it's laid out this plainly. If your coworkers continue to pressure you for an apology, ask how they would feel if you were tasked with controlling their food intake.
