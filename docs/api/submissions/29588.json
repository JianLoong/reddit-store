I told her to mind her own business, and that if she was uncomfortable she should consider not watching me inject the medication that literally allows me to eat. She said she was going to ask her waiter to speak to a manager, and I completed the injection before she even returned to her seat. She did not end up speaking to a manager as far as I know, I'm guessing that the fact that I already finished before she had a chance to kind of rendered it moot.\n\nSo, anyway, AITA?

I\u2019m not diabetic but it runs in my family, and I do have a condition that makes me more likely to pass out if I have to stand still or walk; if I ever do need insulin, getting to the bathroom before my injection could be actively difficult, rather than inconvenient (and I know of people who are diabetic and have this condition). And beyond that, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s best not to do injections in a setting as potentially-filthy as a bathroom. \n\nNot everyone has the courage to stand up to people like her, so thank you for helping normalize medical needs and shut down assholes.
