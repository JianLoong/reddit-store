There is NO need for you to clean up someone else's kid when the parent is RIGHT THERE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd what kind of asshole won't wipe their own kid's butt if he needs it?", "NTA. The idea that you should have done this is only based on your being a woman. And that is sexist bullshit! Everyone should wipe their own child's behind.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t matter how bad of a day someone is having\u2026. You still have to be a parent to your own child. In no world should that be your responsibility as a friend unless you are babysitting.

Someone else's child is not your responsibility at ANY time unless you've explicitly stated you'll take said responsibility. Especially poopy messes. I don't have kids. A choice I've made. Part of that choice involves not wanting to deal with poop from another human being. So definitely not going to have people talk like I'm the AH if I continue that choice.

I can't even imagine how you could mess up cleaning a school aged child so badly that you get poop on your clothing. Based on his wife's response, however, it's clear that this man has no experience caring for his kid's basic hygiene. That isn't your problem, though. It's not reasonable to expect your friends to take care of your kid and it's way out of line that he's mad about this.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your responsibility!

And the wife berated you for not cleaning the child up because your friend was going through a hard time, is depressed, and needed to clear his head by spending time with you.

You weren't babysitting. The Dad wasn't doing anything that works have prevented him from being able to clean up his own kid. (Like if the dad was cooking and handling raw meat or something, I world have seen it as a reasonable request for help) But also,  this is a school-age kid, why the heck isn't he wiping himself? As a teacher and a mom,  unless the child has some developmental issues, a child this age should be pretty self-sufficient in the bathroom.", "NTA. You don't ask other people wipe your kids ass. Though a lot of kids do have trouble at 5/6 still.", "What on earth?! Absolutely NTA.", "Your vagina doesn't make you a magical child care giver. I'm glad that dude left. Don't invite him again and I'd drop the husband and wife. I'm not touching a kid that isn't mine. Especially for something like that. NTA.", "NTA. That\u2019s the parent\u2019s job, 100%.

Wiping the kids butt at 5?!\n\nI'd so dump this friend.", "NTA. I have had parents (family and friends) hesitate to even ask me to change their baby\u2019s diaper if I\u2019m holding them and they are busy, but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m wiping someone who\u2019s shit looks and smells like mine!!

He lost his job and was depressed (I didn't know that) and visited me to clear his head.\n\nlol. It's still not your job to wipe your friend's child's ass.

Did it seem out of character for your friend to act this way? if so it seems like he\u2019s having a tough time with his work problems and so if it is out of character then maybe let it slide and try and be there as a friend in relation to his present mental health.
