We were hanging out and decided to play some Mario Kart in the living room, while his son was playing a game on his Ipad.   \n\n\nHis son then wanted to use the bathroom. He's been here before and knows where to go. I don't have hildren, but I feel like children, around 5 or 6, should be able to wipe themselves, however my friend and his wife still clean him up and wipe him.    \n\n\nWe have since stopped playing and were talking when we hear Jacob call out that he's done (meaning that he's waiting for someone to help him wipe). My friend groaned and didn't get up. He asked me if I could go clean up Jacob. I looked at him with a blank stare which pissed him off. He scoffed and got up to go see Jacob. After a 10 minutes they both emerged from the bathroom. My friend looks livid and says that he has shit on his shirt because of me. (I don't even want to know HOW he ended up with shit on his shirt) and that I should have done it for him. He hates doing it and feels like it's his wife's job. I told him well thankfully I'm not his wife and I'll never clean up his son. He ended up cutting his visit short and left. I don't think i was the asshole but his wife texted me later berating me for not doing this because my friend was having a very rough time. He lost his job and was depressed (I didn't know that) and visited me to clear his head. I felt bad because maybe I should have noticed that his demand was out of the ordinary and done it, now that I know how he felt.\n\n\nEdit: holy shit. I didn't expect this amount of comments! I'm a bit overwhelmed but i'll try to read most comments. This situation is just so mind-boggling and bizzare that it kind of still feels surreal to me. Thank you for all the comments. I'll try to answer some questions I saw. \n\nJacob is not disabled. His mother is really overbearing and just decides to do everything for him, my friend follows suit. Jacob will start school in September (he was homeschooled before). \n\nMy friend has made sexist jokes before, but he did apologize profusely when it made me and his wife uncomfortable. This situation makes be believe that he was always inherently sexist.", "created_utc": 1682863414, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133step/aita_for_not_cleaning_a_helping_a_child_wipe/", "score": 7780, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone else's child is not your responsibility at ANY time unless you've explicitly stated you'll take said responsibility. Especially poopy messes. I don't have kids. A choice I've made. Part of that choice involves not wanting to deal with poop from another human being. So definitely not going to have people talk like I'm the AH if I continue that choice.

I can't even imagine how you could mess up cleaning a school aged child so badly that you get poop on your clothing. Based on his wife's response, however, it's clear that this man has no experience caring for his kid's basic hygiene. That isn't your problem, though.

You weren't babysitting. The Dad wasn't doing anything that works have prevented him from being able to clean up his own kid. (Like if the dad was cooking and handling raw meat or something, I world have seen it as a reasonable request for help) But also,  this is a school-age kid, why the heck isn't he wiping himself? As a teacher and a mom,  unless the child has some developmental issues, a child this age should be pretty self-sufficient in the bathroom.", "NTA. You don't ask other people wipe your kids ass. Though a lot of kids do have trouble at 5/6 still.", "What on earth?! Absolutely NTA.", "Your vagina doesn't make you a magical child care giver. I'm glad that dude left.

At that age, most kids will accidentally shit their pants and lie through their teeth rather than ask us for help. Most will insist on changing themselves. \n\nThere's also some parents who won't LET their kid do it on their own, even at that age. Toilet training is often also training the parents to take the training wheels off.", "Also, OP was supposed to read his mind to know that some tough stuff was happening and therefore be extra nice, without him needing to confide what was going on...", "It is not possible for some kids that age.

Kids by 4-5-6 should definitely be wiping themselves.", "It all depends on arm length. Some kids have smaller arms so they actually can\u2019t reach there. I had a family member who couldn\u2019t do it till they were like 7 because their arms were legit too short to reach fully and they\u2019d either fall in the toilet trying or just overall make a mess and it was easier for the parents to just wipe their butt for them", "The best part is that his way of asking was childishly sighing loudly and complaining that he doesn't like doing it, much like the average 5 year old being told to do something they don't like.", "YES THE MISOGYNY! Everyone saying it\u2019s the parents job is missing the point. People help parents with care for their children all the time.

I could barely poop at home.", "Or the one who thought wiping was gay lol", "Struggling with wiping, as in not being very good at it, is still, like... *developmentally* way better than *literally* not doing it yourself.", "> His incompetence is not your responsibility.\n\nI like this line a lot.", "I'm feeling for you.  I hope your PTSD becomes a little less crippling and the chronic injuries become a little less painful, week by week and month by month.\n\nYour kids lucked out in the Mom department.", "12 months in to this shit show and it gets easier but the PTSD is absolutely savage. \n\nIm a dad but thank you for the compliment regardless", "Thanks for confirming this. My friend was still wiping her kids even after they turned 6/7 and purposely kept them out of school so she didn\u2019t have to train them to wipe on their own. No special needs either.", "So sorry to misgender you.  \n\nI hear you on how savage the PTSD can be.  It took me until after I retired to come to grips with the CPTSD I have.  I took care of my mom before her death and EVERYTHING came up.  Nothing to do but deal with it.\n\nWishing you the best, including some much needed relief.", "No need to apologise at all :)\n\nMines from a car accident and I'm still constantly haunted by nightmares. Therapy and time has helped but those wounds run deep.\n\nThank you, you also! Have a lovely day.", "My kiddo used to get naked to poop \ud83e\udd23 cut to him one day running out of the bathroom bare assed and yelling \u201cMOM! MOM! Come look at this big poop I made!\u201d", "Would it maybe help him to get one of those hand-held mirrors so he can check himself? Or have a mirror in the bathroom on the floor?", "Mine too. Until 7 years old. He\u2019s a freaking genius, but he was too grossed out to do it himself. It made him gag.", "aaahhh childhood", "Omg \ud83d\ude33 forbidden hand warmer", "To his credit, it was a *gigantic* turd", "Yes, yes they are. And let\u2019s not forget the ones who have shit covered undies because they don\u2019t wipe.", "Oh dear...\n\n\nFrankie (greyhound, they have guts like Pratchett swamp dragons) once paused to crap by a tree and sprayed it with diarrhoea to about waist height.\n\n\nIn the middle of a plaza full of children, right after lockdown lifted.\n\n\nThere was literally nothing I could do.", "I am fairly certain it would end up in the drink\u2026it\u2019s still cool for now. He\u2019s come a long way!", "Same with my cousin, was age 8 and mad at ma for not wiping his butt OR bathing him after the mess. Never invited back to our house after that (or our uncle & aunt) lmao\ud83e\udd23", "Wow, that\u2019s so childish. \n\nClearly the mature thing to do is rock, paper, scissors. \ud83e\udd2a", "TIL about shower shitters \ud83d\ude33 \n\nI wonder what the venn diagram of shower shitters and dudes who don't wash in between their buttcheeks looks like", "My dad would do that... to my mom. He'd yell for her, all frantic-like, to come into the bathroom, only to show her his latest creation. She was never impressed."]}
