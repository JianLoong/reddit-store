{"id": 1988, "submission_id": "yrm5q8", "title": "AITA for not letting SIL stay over with 1.5 week old baby?", "selftext": "For some context, my husband and his sister(SIL) have over a 5 year age gap and they are very different from one another and so they do not really have much communication besides SIL only messaging him when she needs something. Never once has she wished him Happy Birthday or Congrats for something, and so she already is not my favorite person. After no communication from her for over 7 months she is asking to stay in our guest room overnight before going to a family event.\n\nMy husband and I live in a 2 bedroom apartment. The spare room is used as an office and for guests so there's a large desk and a bed in there. This weekend we have a family event that is roughly 30 min from our apartment. SIL lives an hour from us and so her drive to the event would be 1.5 hours. She asked if her, her husband, 4yo daughter and 1.5 week old infant can stay with us before the event. Her reasoning was that she did not want to drive the extra hour and would rather drive in parts.\n\nMy husband was on the fence about it since he hasn't seen our niece in over a year and has yet to meet the baby but I flat out said no. My reasoning was that we share a wall with the bedroom and I am a light sleeper, I would be super sleep deprived being woken up every few hours by a 1.5 week old baby and we have 3 events to go to the next day. I also did not feel comfortable with them staying all in one room. Its not a large room and  I do not own a crib/bassinet and do not have an extra bed for the 4yo to sleep in.\n\nI am being told by some friends that I'm TA, that its only one night and they it would have been nice bonding time for us and our nieces, but I just don't think its practical or safe for her to come with a 1.5 week old when we are not set up for that. I'm starting to think that maybe I made too big of a deal about it, so am AITA?\n\nEdit:  She went pretty much no contact with us after we let her stay with us last summer cause she was going to divorce her husband. We watched our niece for free while my husband and I WFH full time. During that time she provided no food, clothes or toys for her daughter while we watched her. We instead bought everything for her. She then left to reconcile with her husband, not thank you at all, just quietly left. Came home one day and all her and our nieces stuff were gone. The last time she contacted us was when she sent a picture of her pregnancy test to my husband. No comment, just a picture. My husband tried to reach out and she never replied back. So no I dont think she would have brought a bed with her.

Seriously 1.5 hrs is NOT very far. That\u2019s almost a one way trip to the city for me. My kids have been making that almost weekly since birth rofl. Sometimes multiple times a week for specialty appts. It\u2019s not a big deal. Now had you told me a 3+ hr drive I would be singing a different tune. With that said...SIL did just give birth a week and a half ago. Also...a week old baby going to a family event during flu and cold season with covid in the mix? Is it even a wise decision for them to be 1. Traveling and 2. Going to a large gathering with a baby who has minimal immune system?", "NTA The drive is only an hour and a half, who asks to stay over to avoid a drive that short?? She asked, you answered, that should be the end of that. People have daily commutes that are longer than that. I'm also assuming you only have one bathroom right? For 6 people? Hell no would be my answer \ud83d\ude02. I'd maybe offer to pay half the price for a hotel for them if it's that important.", "NTA you have no room to accommodate that many people. Where does she think everyone will sleep. It\u2019s not safe for the baby either.", "NTA.  All things considered, IMO you made the right call.  SIL can stay in a hotel/motel if she wants to make the trip in two steps.", "Nta good on you for watching out for that baby", "NTA. It would be different if she actually had any kind of relationship with her brother and you, but she doesn\u2019t. From what you say, it sounds like she doesn\u2019t really care to, unless she needs something. Considering you were kind enough to let her stay with you before, and that she just left without a word and ghosted you since then except to send your husband a picture of a pregnancy test, it makes sense to say no. Besides, 90 minutes is not a long drive at all, even with a newborn.", "I think that SIL has a devious plan here.  She will show up without her husband, and say that she has left him again, and will be homeless unless they let her stay. \n\nShe plans to come and live with OP and her husband until they make up again, or she finds another man.\n\nIf she does come to the family events, I bet that OP will find out that she has found another place to stay, and won't be going home.\n\nNTA  Hold your ground or you will never be rid of her.", "Nta", "NTA.   She can get  hotel.  You do not owe her anything.", "NAH, your reasoning makes sense. You don't have enough space for them, you don't have a crib, and a 4 year old and newborn baby is very loud in the house, especially an apartment. Could they compromise with a hotel or other accomidation nearby? \n\nI could understand their reasoning for staying with you if they're on a budget. Driving over an hour with a newborn might be difficult. But on the other hand, breaking it up as she suggested doesn't seem like it'll make *that* much of a difference.", "A little hard to say. On the one hand, I get not wanting to be kept up by a bebe half the night. On the other hand, if they're alright with the cramped conditions, one night doesn't seem too awful and it might well be a chance to make the relationship better. On the other-OTHER hand, I don't think a 1.5 hour drive is anything major. \n\nI think I'm gonna go with a technical NTA, but that a single night isn't necessarily a huge ask either. Sometimes we do things for others that make us less comfortable that we might like to be, and that's okay; that kind of thing tends to come around when we need it, if we do. Just food for thought.", "NAH - You're not the AH for not wanting 4 extra people, one being a crying infant staying the night. Personally, I'd rather drive the extra hour than unpack all the kid stuff and crash in an office/guestroom, but that's me. \n\nI do question your bitterness towards her. I have two half-sisters both 20+ years younger than I am. We didn't grow up together, and they were always the child on the receiving end of the gifts from me their adult older sister.  It never occurred to either of them to reciprocate.  It annoys me, but I'm not mad about it.   If it doesn't bother your husband, leave it alone.  Even if it does bother him, leave it alone.  Not your fight.", "INFO: Did you explain the space issue to her, and make it clear that all 4 of them would be in a room that also has a big desk? Also, do you have 1 or 2 bathrooms? \n\nAsking because IMO it would be good to say yes to them, but set boundaries: 1) you and DH will be in your usual room and they'll have to make do in the room with the desk; and 2) make it clear when you need to use the bathroom to get ready for the family event. \n\nThen, earplugs. (I'm also a light sleeper, and earplugs help.) It's only 1 night! But the repercussions of not letting them stay would probably last much longer.", "Are hotels not a thing in your area?\nNTA", "NTA, but... who in their right mind would rather spend a whole night with 4 people in one bedroom than drive for 1.5 hours in a car together? And one of them is a newborn? Nobody is getting any sleep in that room.", "NTA  You don't exist unless she wants something from you.  Far too many people especially a tiny one.", "INFO\n\n>After no communication from her for over 7 months\n\nShe would have been 3.5 months pregnant at the the time of last contact. Since then did you or husband make any effort during that 7 months to ask about her pregnancy or her health?\n\nWhy are you assuming she would not bring the requisite things for her baby to safely sleep?", "NTA : that's a lot of people in a 2 bdrm apartment. They can get a hotel room.", "So let me get this straight: you want your husband to have a relationship with his sister but you don't want to put her up for a single night to a family event you're all going to? NTA but you're basically ensuring you don't have a relationship with them.", "NTA, but still wrong. If mom feels it would be safe and practical, it\u2019s not your judgment call to make, and pinning it on that is a massive reach. If you\u2019re just uncomfortable with it and don\u2019t want 3 extra humans in your house, that\u2019s completely justified and no is a complete sentence, but there\u2019s nothing unsafe or weird about them all being in one room.", "Your friends are right, YTA and making a big deal over this. It\u2019s one night", "NAH but it would be nice for you and your husband to meet the baby and spend time with the niece. If your husband wants them to stay and you refuse then you'd be TA.", "NTA,  it's your house, but a baby under 2 weeks old is not likely to need a whole lot of stuff. She will only eat, sleep, and dirty diapers. You may be having exaggerated expectations of how inconvenient that would be.", "[deleted]", "YTA for not chatting with the sister in law to let her know the challenges of the room and what your reservations are.\n\nShe sucks, and doesn\u2019t value you guys very much. That said, if your husband wants to meet the baby and see his niece, it\u2019s worth putting up with the parents and having one rough night of sleep even if you have \u201cevents\u201d the next day (depending on what they are).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even her request to stay overnight to breakup a 1.5 hour drive -- like 1.5 hours is not that long of a drive. But whatever, maybe she is is using that as an excuse for some bonding time. Just for the opp to bond, I would not consider it a big deal to let her stay.  You seem to be holding on to some resentment over her past (admittedly, odd) behavior.  Your excuses are flimsy; she could bring a bassinet & have the 4 year old sleep in a pack & play or inflatable toddler bed.", "YTA it is just one night and for the bigger picture.

It sounds like your SIL has been going through it and the way you worded it made her sound like she's not the nicest person. I get that your frustrated with the situation, but she was on the verge of going through a divorce, she could've just been stressed and forgot everything while she was in a hurry to leave, as well as probably embarrassed about her situation. Your husband and his sister could just very well be content with having minimal contact. Driving an hour and a half isn't that big of a deal unless you have toddlers and a newborn. That 1.5hr drive could turn into a lot longer drive.. Stopping to feed, and change diapers. It's one night, and if your husband wants to spend time with his nieces, let it happen.
