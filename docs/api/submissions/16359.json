Debbie even sees him as her dad and she calls them both dad.\n\nWhen we got married we had to find a home very close to my BIL's home because of Debbie. Because of this we didn't have many options and ended up with a 2 bedroom house. We could buy a bigger house with more rooms elsewhere but Debbie wouldn't live anywhere that wasn't close to her uncle's home.\n\nThis has made some problems for us. We have a 4 years old son and Debbie won't share a room with him and won't let us move to another home.\n\nI finally got tired of her attitude and when she was at school I put all of my son's stuff in Debbie's room. When she came back home she started yelling at us saying she won't share. I said fine then you can have the couch. She ran to her room and called her uncle. Her uncle took her to his home and she is saying she won't come back unless we put my son out of her room. I told my husband he should just let her live with her uncle. He is like a dad to her and his home is very close to us and he can see her whenever he wants.

When you marry someone with a kid, they come as a unit,\n\nHaving said that, the degree to which your family\u2019s life is being constrained is ridiculous.  I think the best option may be to move farther away so that you can buy a house big enough for your whole family.  That will mean she sees her uncle less, but that\u2019s a less bad option than breaking up your husband and your stepdaughter.  The bit where she \u201cwon\u2019t let\u201d you move to a different house is giving a child too much control over your household.", "YTA and so is your husband. \n\nYou both created this ridiculous situation by letting *checks notes* a child determine where you live. Imaging letting a 14 year old make these decisions for you. Be an adult, grow up, move, and she can visit her uncle frequently. If she throws a fit and says she wants to live with her uncle once you move, it is your husband's choice as to how to manage that.", "YTA: You shouldn't try to force a 14 year old girl to share her room with a 4 year old boy. The way you handle the whole situation seems a bit immature. Remember you're the adult. You should never argue with children on their level. Also telling your husband that he should let his daughter go live with her uncles is a shitty thing to say. Even if she sees the uncles as a second dad.\n\nHOWEVER, it's not fair to you all that you should live in a 2 bedroom house when you're 4 people. You and your husband need to sit down and make some tough decisions. I get your step daughter wants to be near her uncle but your living situation is just not feasible once your son gets older. It's not going to be a fun decision but you need to move somewhere that has room for all of you. Just don't handle it in an immature manner like you have done so far (e.g. moving your son's stuff in her room).", "YTA. Obviously. You\u2019ve essentially forcibly displaced your step-daughter.

If you fell in love, presumably discussed having kids like a couple should, thought you were on the same page and then got roped into a two bedroom house because it's the only thing close enough, the dad is a massive AH. It's not right for you to resent Debbie, but your feelings are misplaced, not unfounded.\nUncle/Dad has way too much control unless he has custody or is fighting for custody. Your husband needs to put his foot down.

Maybe Uncle/Dad is the one who should be moving close to you to maintain things if that's what you all think is best. Your current situation isn't sustainable though. I feel for your son too. If your husband doesn't put his foot down about all this, best case scenario she moves when she's 18 and he is a 9 year old just getting to transition out of his parents' room.

Her father and her uncle should have both backed you up on it.

If that involves telling the uncle to back off a bit, tell him. \n\nAs for her not wanting to share a room, that\u2019s fair enough imo.

You choose to have a kid you couldn't afford to house in the area you're forced to live in. You've pandered to your SD's demands for so long that now your 4 year old is paying the consequences.\n\nLook, you can't just offload a kid onto someone who doesn't have legal custody. You can't demand that your husband abandon his daughter. You can't take it out on SD the fact that all three adults can't effectively parent together. But your son also can't grow up without a room and kids 10 years apart in age are never going to be able to share. Where the heck is he sleeping now?\n\nYou have to move to a bigger home, and it's time to put SD in therapy, both individual and family, to help her understand and process her family dynamic. I'd actually include BIL, as he doesn't sound like the best co-parent when he's allowing SD to weaponize their relationship against your husband. (Which you are also doing, btw.) This whole dynamic sounds toxic AF.", "Yta. It\u2019s not Debbie\u2019s fault you are in a two bedroom. It\u2019s yours and your husbands. You both agreed.

You knew you needed to find a bigger house in the area of your step daughter\u2019s other parent figure. Yet you chose to go ahead and have another kid. This is your problem, not hers. Pushing her out will lead to huge resentment and likely seal the deal with your divorce. It doesn\u2019t sound like you even like her anyway.", "YTA. \n\nI absolutely despise people who marry someone with a kid without the intention of treating that child as well as they would their own. No kid asks for a step-parent. They are forced upon them. It's obvious you see Debbie as your husband's daughter. She's nothing to you. \n\nIt's madness that you and your husband allowed a child to determine where you live. Obviously with two children you'd need a 3 bedroom home. Some families can't afford that, but you made it clear that yours can. You guys should have bought a house that was right for your family regardless of how far Debbie's Uncle was. After all, the Uncle is the Uncle, and your husband is the father.  Uncle could have visited and vice versa. Maybe even a split custody arrangement. \n\nYou said, \"Debbie won't share her room.\" Once again; Debbie is the child. You and your husband are not obligated to follow her every order. I shared a room with my sister, and Debbie could have shared it with her brother. But that was a matter to be dealt with as a family and as soon as you moved in.\n\n Waiting until Debbie has become accustomed to her own space and then taking it away from her without discussing it with your husband and without a formal sit down with Debbie was wrong in every way. Just changing her space while she's gone is sinister and shows a desire for a type of \"revenge\" against an actual child in your care. Leaving your husband out of the decision entirely seems especially malicious. \n\nWorst of all, you actually requested that your husband give up custody of his daughter. It's apparent you don't care about Debbie at all. You'd rather have her out of the picture so you and your husband can focus on YOUR kid and YOUR family. You don't see Debbie as your daughter, and that's the biggest issue here. \n\nYour parenting is crap. You treat children like shit. You don't consult your husband on manners involving his own child and his home. In what possible way are you not the asshole? \n\nImagine how Debbie would feel if her dad ditched her cause step-mom said so. Dad has already made her life significantly worse by bringing you into it, and now you want him to give her up entirely. You're a nightmare. And your husband isn't much better. I feel really bad for Debbie. Something tells me this is just one bad incident in a long list of being treated as the unwanted step-kid.", "NTA but your husband and your stepdaughter are.  You gave her two options move farther away from uncle or share with her brother. It\u2019s not that crazy for siblings to share a room.

If you need more space, as the adult you make that decision and then discuss it with your family.  It\u2019s definitely not going to be easy but hey, neither is parenting.  You are the asshole because instead of doing the bare minimum (which again is TALKING to her and setting healthy boundaries) you are trying to forcibly remove her from her home and isolate her from one of her main supporters.  Additionally, a 14 year old needs privacy more than a 4 year old child so yeah, I can see why she doesn\u2019t want to share a room.  I wouldn\u2019t want to either if I was 14.  I don\u2019t see how you typed this whole thing out and still thought \u201cyeah, all the decisions we are making are good and healthy for this child\u201d AND how you are doubling down in the comments.

But you don\u2019t have to be.\n\nSimilar to other comments on this thread, your house and letting a 14 year old child make decisions on where you live is not fit-for-purpose for your family. You and your husband are adults and are capable of making a decision that benefits all of you. If I was in that situation, I would talk to the uncle and ask him to have a chat with your step-daughter about how they will still see each other and can visit even though they live further away. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s being vindictive for wanting to be close to her uncle and have her own bedroom, those two things are her safety net.

Debbie even sees him as her dad and she calls them both dad.\n\nWhen we got married we had to find a home very close to my BIL's home because of Debbie. Because of this we didn't have many options and ended up with a 2 bedroom house. We could buy a bigger house with more rooms elsewhere but Debbie wouldn't live anywhere that wasn't close to her uncle's home.\n\nThis has made some problems for us. We have a 4 years old son and Debbie won't share a room with him and won't let us move to another home.\n\nI finally got tired of her attitude and when she was at school I put all of my son's stuff in Debbie's room. When she came back home she started yelling at us saying she won't share. I said fine then you can have the couch. She ran to her room and called her uncle. Her uncle took her to his home and she is saying she won't come back unless we put my son out of her room. I told my husband he should just let her live with her uncle. He is like a dad to her and his home is very close to us and he can see her whenever he wants. This will solve all of our problems but my husband thinks I'm an asshole and my IL's all agree with her\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes, it\u2019s not fair to you or your son but, again, your hubby has primarily made this dynamic between the three of them (Uncle, hubby, and step daughter) possible.

That\u2019s the thing, this is a dynamic that has existed long before you came into the picture and will persist so long as Uncle and Dad stick to it. Even if you get Hubby in gear and he starts putting his foot down, the dynamic already established in his child will mean she will push against it. Uncle supporting the status quo/established dynamic means step daughter can/will resent both you and Hubs for the change. I don\u2019t believe this would be a primarily sinister reaction on her part either. The current dynamic is what she is familiar with and was raised with. To move away from it, without the support of who she views to be her primary parental figure will make her uncomfortable and uncertain.
