I suspect that the stylist just wants to make sure you don't complain at the end of the hair cut - I could imagine parents saying do what they want and then just playing on their phone and being shocked at the end of the cut.", "NTA\n\nAs a woman I cannot count the number of times I've gone in for a cut or color and the stylist has tried to refuse what I ask. Then I see people go into salons and walk out with rainbow hair or bright neon blue but my asking for blonde or a pixie cut is unreasonable somehow? A few years ago I got sick of the BS. If I want to cut off all my hair or go platinum or whatever, do what I ask you to do. If you refuse, say that you refuse instead of beating around the bush and trying to talk me into something I don't want. But in the end, it's my damn head. Now, if a stylist starts trying to talk me out of something, I walk out and go somewhere else. \n\nI'm not sure why stylists think they have some god given right to tell customers they're wrong for asking for what they want. I get it. SOME people get upset. But ffs, give Women the benefit of the doubt that yes, we know what the hell we want. Stop treating us like we're too ignorant to know what's best for Us. If its that huge of a deal, start making people sign Non-Complaint Disclaimers--like an NDA. But don't just assume I have no idea what I'm doing or that I'm going to automatically freak out over a stupid haircut. \n\nNext week I'm going back to get a pixie and have it dyed platinum. No regrets. It's just hair--it'll grow out if I don't like it.", "Nah \n\nI get why after the 3rd and 4th pushback from the hair dresser that you were over it. You weren't rude, you didn't yell or swear. \n\nI also get her re-checking with you because I'd say the hairstylist has probably copped more than a couple of sprays from parents peeved that their kid has gone and done something nuts to their hair. The \"more feminine\" line sucked, but I get her checking the rest.  \n\nNot all kids are lucky enough to have a parent who understands body autonomy.", "NTA, I get being frustrated. Yes you were a bit rude, but I get where\u2019s it coming from. And I\u2019d have been annoyed when they made the comment about it \u201cbeing more feminine\u201d. That being said, this is why it is good to always go to a regular stylist. It\u2019s so much easier when you have one you have a good rapport with, and they can start anticipating what you want.", "NTA\n\nI know it's not always financially feasible, but as a woman who has had non-traditional hairstyles for most of my nearly 50 yrs (including shaved head, undercuts, high & tights, pixie cuts, a rainbow of colors, etc) it makes life MUCH better when you find a good stylist who you go to regularly. It is totally normal for them to verify that you really want shorter/more unusual things since it's not like they can glue it back on, but moving it into the sexist BS of them trying to argue that traditional feminine styles are better was absolutely unacceptable. They might as well have just said out loud \"can't have men thinking you're lesbians or trans\"...I'd have lost my shit at that.", "NTA.  \"They tried to argue that it looked more feminine at the length it was at.\" Oh hell no. I would not be giving them my money. It's good of you to tell them to not ask you, ask them! It's their hair!

She just covering her own ass.", "NTA you told the stylist multiple times and it should have been pretty obvious that you were ok with tour girls making their own decisions. They even showed a picture and you said it was fine! It seems like the stylist was being judgmental of what they wanted and wasn't comfortable doing the cuts for that reason.", "NTA. You reiterated several times throughout the same visit that your daughters can get whatever they want. The stylist kept asking you the same exact question, several times.

There was no need for you to get upset", "YTA. You were rude. Let's take a step back and ask ourselves why this hairdresser might obsessively check in on the parent before making what could be drastic changes to the child's hair. I promise you they've been yelled at, or their friends/coworkers, after they received \"permission\". Is it annoying? Sure. But that's what they likely need to do to prevent a full meltdown in their shop. No need to give them a hard time when responding doesn't actually take any effort.", "Nta, but you do need to understand that they ask you so many questions, and if everything is ok because they've probably had really bad experiences in the past with parents.", "Honestly, YTA they're both minors . Sure you meant what you said, but ppl are a holes and I'm sure the stylist has dealt with plenty of \"do what you want \" then gotten shit for not checking in more. She was protecting herself and you still gave her shit cause you couldn't be bothered to say yes a few more times than you thought ? Maybe think about it from her perspective for a second. Damned if you do and damned if you don't with customer service.", "YTA Many stylists have been given crap and even threats and nonpayment cutting kids hair. They are doing due diligence. Suck it up and stop being so rude.", "ESH, you did clearly state multiple times that your kids had free choice, and the hairdresser should have stopped, but I can also understand exactly why they kept asking and making sure the job is done correctly. I'll be honest I don't see a scenario where it would have been smooth sailing, it's just a personality and precaution clash.", "You\u2019re mad because you\u2019re telling them about bodily autonomy and they\u2019re not respecting your views. Understandable. NTA", "YTA. \n\nYes, you had to repeat yourself multiple times. Yes, that\u2019s REALLY frustrating. It\u2019s a big pet peeve of mine, too. \n\nThere was no need to treat them that way for being thorough and checking for parental consent in today\u2019s world of posting everything on social media at the slightest upset or misunderstanding. The service industry is rough.", "YTA - But this is mild at best. I can certainly understand that it can be frustrating to be asked the same thing repeatedly. And sometimes, our emotions can get the better of us, and we lash out. Does that make it right? No.\n\nIn the future, you could always let them know at the beginning of the haircut that whatever the kids want is okay with you.", "YTA\n\nYou were rude. Clearly this habit of asking repeatedly came from their experience of parents being pissed at stylists.  I remember a post here a few months back of a woman who berated a stylist for cutting her daughter's hair the way the daughter asked for it to be cut. \n\nI feel bad for the stylist, they must dread cutting children's hair at this point, they can't win..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My hair was pretty standard for the mid-90s - long, straight, a few layers, with bangs. One day, shortly after graduating high school (not quite 18), I was frustrated with it and wanted it cut to my shoulders. I made an appointment, drove myself to the salon of my choice (my mom used a different salon), had my own money in hand, and asked the stylist to cut it. She refused, claiming she needed my mom\u2019s permission. I walked out with un-cut hair because I wasn\u2019t playing her game. She still called my mom\u2026at work\u2026and my mom was PISSED that the stylist disturbed her at work because, as she said, it was MY hair and MY choice. I never had my hair done in that town again.

I would send my kids to the barber shop by themselves if they would speak real English. My kid went to a new person without me and asked for them to cut his triangle. My only rules for them right now are that they need to do the daily maintenance by themselves and they can\u2019t make drastic changes on a whim. But my kids are also a lot younger than yours.", "YTA. Both your girls are minors, and as such, the stylist has a responsibility to make sure the parent is OK with what they are doing. I would bet that they have been confronted before by iirate parents in their career, for doing what their minor client has aske, even though the parent has said do what you want.", "NTA\n\nI had this exact same problem once my daughter decided she was over having waist length hair.\n\nThe first two cuts were to her shoulders & then her chin. Same salon. Both visits it was like pulling teeth to get the damn stylist to do her job & cut her hair the way we BOTH asked for.\n\nShe even said \"Well, how's her daddy gonna feel about this?\" MORE THAN ONCE & I kinda wanted to commit a felony right then & there. (Her daddy btw doesn't GAF how she does her hair so long as she's happy.)\n\nSo we found a new, better salon. (It\u2019s actually one I used to go to 20yrs ago, so maybe not so new. LOL) It's a town over, but she gets her own dedicated stylist (Mr. Jacob. We love him.) & after our 1st visit when I said \"It\u2019s her hair. She\u2019s the boss. Give her whatever she wants.\", he hasn't asked for my permission or whatever once & it's great. (He did ask if I'd thought about her having an undercut because her hair is insanely thick, which I thought was a great idea. So we showed her pictures & she loved it. Been rocking a chin length bob with an undercut for going on 2yrs now.)\n\nWe also started taking her little brother there & he has his own very nice stylist that he's declared he will marry someday. (He's seven, so it's cute. Not creepy. I promise.)\n\nAlso also, we all have AuDHD & they actually have sensory sensitivity training which is freaking glorious. Silent appointments are SO restful.\n\nTotally worth the extra miles & money.", "Mild YTA.

It was senior year and most of us seniors were getting professional portraits done, so a few kids decided to go all out for silly school ones. Well, the photographer has a fit and refused to take their picture because they were beautiful girls and he refused to photograph them looking so ugly or something (they had silly hats and stick on moustaches). Eventually someone has to get the principal who was like, \"Just take the damn pictures, why am I here?\" He eventually dud but grumbled the whole time.

She did an Elvis face that was so hilariously bad I said we HAD to do it. But the guy kept pushing showgirls. Even made us take extra pictures so he could show us how the showgirls would look. He seemed genuinely upset when we still took the Marilyn and Elvis one home instead.\n\nSome people get oddly offended, and seem to take it personally, when women or girls do something that makes them seem less feminine or traditionally attractive. It's gross.", "I have a friend who\u2019s a stylist - she is so talented, can do miracles with a cut and color. But she is also super sensitive. She got in this career to help women feel better about themselves\u2026and in the rare moment when her clients don\u2019t like their cut or style, it kills her. Like, for real, it takes her time to get over feeling guilty that her client feels badly.  Because for good or for ill, women\u2019s confidences are deeply affected by their feelings about their hair, and she\u2019s in it to build women up.\n\nI agree women should totally get what they want, it use to bug me to be questioned, too.
