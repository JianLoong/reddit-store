I suspect that the stylist just wants to make sure you don't complain at the end of the hair cut - I could imagine parents saying do what they want and then just playing on their phone and being shocked at the end of the cut.", "NTA\n\nAs a woman I cannot count the number of times I've gone in for a cut or color and the stylist has tried to refuse what I ask. Then I see people go into salons and walk out with rainbow hair or bright neon blue but my asking for blonde or a pixie cut is unreasonable somehow? A few years ago I got sick of the BS. If I want to cut off all my hair or go platinum or whatever, do what I ask you to do. If you refuse, say that you refuse instead of beating around the bush and trying to talk me into something I don't want. But in the end, it's my damn head. Now, if a stylist starts trying to talk me out of something, I walk out and go somewhere else. \n\nI'm not sure why stylists think they have some god given right to tell customers they're wrong for asking for what they want. I get it. SOME people get upset. But ffs, give Women the benefit of the doubt that yes, we know what the hell we want. Stop treating us like we're too ignorant to know what's best for Us. If its that huge of a deal, start making people sign Non-Complaint Disclaimers--like an NDA. But don't just assume I have no idea what I'm doing or that I'm going to automatically freak out over a stupid haircut. \n\nNext week I'm going back to get a pixie and have it dyed platinum. No regrets. It's just hair--it'll grow out if I don't like it.", "Nah \n\nI get why after the 3rd and 4th pushback from the hair dresser that you were over it. You weren't rude, you didn't yell or swear. \n\nI also get her re-checking with you because I'd say the hairstylist has probably copped more than a couple of sprays from parents peeved that their kid has gone and done something nuts to their hair. The \"more feminine\" line sucked, but I get her checking the rest.  \n\nNot all kids are lucky enough to have a parent who understands body autonomy.", "NTA, I get being frustrated. Yes you were a bit rude, but I get where\u2019s it coming from. And I\u2019d have been annoyed when they made the comment about it \u201cbeing more feminine\u201d. That being said, this is why it is good to always go to a regular stylist. It\u2019s so much easier when you have one you have a good rapport with, and they can start anticipating what you want.", "NTA\n\nI know it's not always financially feasible, but as a woman who has had non-traditional hairstyles for most of my nearly 50 yrs (including shaved head, undercuts, high & tights, pixie cuts, a rainbow of colors, etc) it makes life MUCH better when you find a good stylist who you go to regularly. It is totally normal for them to verify that you really want shorter/more unusual things since it's not like they can glue it back on, but moving it into the sexist BS of them trying to argue that traditional feminine styles are better was absolutely unacceptable. They might as well have just said out loud \"can't have men thinking you're lesbians or trans\"...I'd have lost my shit at that.", "NTA.  \"They tried to argue that it looked more feminine at the length it was at.\" Oh hell no. I would not be giving them my money. It's good of you to tell them to not ask you, ask them! It's their hair!

She just covering her own ass.", "NTA you told the stylist multiple times and it should have been pretty obvious that you were ok with tour girls making their own decisions. They even showed a picture and you said it was fine! It seems like the stylist was being judgmental of what they wanted and wasn't comfortable doing the cuts for that reason.", "NTA. You reiterated several times throughout the same visit that your daughters can get whatever they want. The stylist kept asking you the same exact question, several times. Anybody would\u2019ve gotten annoyed by the end of it.", "NTA", "NTA.

There was no need for you to get upset", "YTA. You were rude. Let's take a step back and ask ourselves why this hairdresser might obsessively check in on the parent before making what could be drastic changes to the child's hair. I promise you they've been yelled at, or their friends/coworkers, after they received \"permission\". Is it annoying? Sure. But that's what they likely need to do to prevent a full meltdown in their shop. No need to give them a hard time when responding doesn't actually take any effort.", "Nta, but you do need to understand that they ask you so many questions, and if everything is ok because they've probably had really bad experiences in the past with parents.", "Honestly, YTA they're both minors . Sure you meant what you said, but ppl are a holes and I'm sure the stylist has dealt with plenty of \"do what you want \" then gotten shit for not checking in more. She was protecting herself and you still gave her shit cause you couldn't be bothered to say yes a few more times than you thought ? Maybe think about it from her perspective for a second. Damned if you do and damned if you don't with customer service.", "YTA Many stylists have been given crap and even threats and nonpayment cutting kids hair. They are doing due diligence. Suck it up and stop being so rude.", "ESH, you did clearly state multiple times that your kids had free choice, and the hairdresser should have stopped, but I can also understand exactly why they kept asking and making sure the job is done correctly. I'll be honest I don't see a scenario where it would have been smooth sailing, it's just a personality and precaution clash.", "You\u2019re mad because you\u2019re telling them about bodily autonomy and they\u2019re not respecting your views. Understandable. NTA", "YTA. \n\nYes, you had to repeat yourself multiple times. Yes, that\u2019s REALLY frustrating. It\u2019s a big pet peeve of mine, too. \n\nThere was no need to treat them that way for being thorough and checking for parental consent in today\u2019s world of posting everything on social media at the slightest upset or misunderstanding. The service industry is rough.", "YTA - But this is mild at best. I can certainly understand that it can be frustrating to be asked the same thing repeatedly. And sometimes, our emotions can get the better of us, and we lash out. Does that make it right? No.\n\nIn the future, you could always let them know at the beginning of the haircut that whatever the kids want is okay with you.", "YTA\n\nYou were rude. Clearly this habit of asking repeatedly came from their experience of parents being pissed at stylists.  I remember a post here a few months back of a woman who berated a stylist for cutting her daughter's hair the way the daughter asked for it to be cut. \n\nI feel bad for the stylist, they must dread cutting children's hair at this point, they can't win..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My hair was pretty standard for the mid-90s - long, straight, a few layers, with bangs. One day, shortly after graduating high school (not quite 18), I was frustrated with it and wanted it cut to my shoulders. I made an appointment, drove myself to the salon of my choice (my mom used a different salon), had my own money in hand, and asked the stylist to cut it. She refused, claiming she needed my mom\u2019s permission. I walked out with un-cut hair because I wasn\u2019t playing her game. She still called my mom\u2026at work\u2026and my mom was PISSED that the stylist disturbed her at work because, as she said, it was MY hair and MY choice. I never had my hair done in that town again. Hair grows back. There are bigger issues in the world. Thanks for letting your kids express themselves.", "I don't want to call you The Asshole because I applaud you letting your kids express themselves and your full support of that. But you have to realize your support is extremely rare and the poor stylist was just trying to give you respect as the mom to make the final decisions.

I would send my kids to the barber shop by themselves if they would speak real English. My kid went to a new person without me and asked for them to cut his triangle. My only rules for them right now are that they need to do the daily maintenance by themselves and they can\u2019t make drastic changes on a whim. But my kids are also a lot younger than yours.", "YTA. Both your girls are minors, and as such, the stylist has a responsibility to make sure the parent is OK with what they are doing. I would bet that they have been confronted before by iirate parents in their career, for doing what their minor client has aske, even though the parent has said do what you want.", "NTA\n\nI had this exact same problem once my daughter decided she was over having waist length hair.\n\nThe first two cuts were to her shoulders & then her chin. Same salon. Both visits it was like pulling teeth to get the damn stylist to do her job & cut her hair the way we BOTH asked for.\n\nShe even said \"Well, how's her daddy gonna feel about this?\" MORE THAN ONCE & I kinda wanted to commit a felony right then & there. (Her daddy btw doesn't GAF how she does her hair so long as she's happy.)\n\nSo we found a new, better salon. (It\u2019s actually one I used to go to 20yrs ago, so maybe not so new. LOL) It's a town over, but she gets her own dedicated stylist (Mr. Jacob. We love him.) & after our 1st visit when I said \"It\u2019s her hair. She\u2019s the boss. Give her whatever she wants.\", he hasn't asked for my permission or whatever once & it's great. (He did ask if I'd thought about her having an undercut because her hair is insanely thick, which I thought was a great idea. So we showed her pictures & she loved it. Been rocking a chin length bob with an undercut for going on 2yrs now.)\n\nWe also started taking her little brother there & he has his own very nice stylist that he's declared he will marry someday. (He's seven, so it's cute. Not creepy. I promise.)\n\nAlso also, we all have AuDHD & they actually have sensory sensitivity training which is freaking glorious. Silent appointments are SO restful.\n\nTotally worth the extra miles & money.", "Mild YTA.  I allow my kids the same choice and I've managed to never be snarky or blow up at stylists who want to double check with me.

It was senior year and most of us seniors were getting professional portraits done, so a few kids decided to go all out for silly school ones. Well, the photographer has a fit and refused to take their picture because they were beautiful girls and he refused to photograph them looking so ugly or something (they had silly hats and stick on moustaches). Eventually someone has to get the principal who was like, \"Just take the damn pictures, why am I here?\" He eventually dud but grumbled the whole time.

She did an Elvis face that was so hilariously bad I said we HAD to do it. But the guy kept pushing showgirls. Even made us take extra pictures so he could show us how the showgirls would look. He seemed genuinely upset when we still took the Marilyn and Elvis one home instead.\n\nSome people get oddly offended, and seem to take it personally, when women or girls do something that makes them seem less feminine or traditionally attractive. It's gross.", "I have a friend who\u2019s a stylist - she is so talented, can do miracles with a cut and color. But she is also super sensitive. She got in this career to help women feel better about themselves\u2026and in the rare moment when her clients don\u2019t like their cut or style, it kills her. Like, for real, it takes her time to get over feeling guilty that her client feels badly.  Because for good or for ill, women\u2019s confidences are deeply affected by their feelings about their hair, and she\u2019s in it to build women up.\n\nI agree women should totally get what they want, it use to bug me to be questioned, too.

I didn't have the backbone to be as blunt as you are and I wish I was like that sometimes.

You have no idea the number of raging asshole parents cosmetologists deal with on a daily basis. You get to count yourself among their number now. \n\nWhen there is a parent present for a cut they always defer to the parent and make sure they are happy because the parent is paying and 6 times out of 10 they will fly off the handle for most minor of things. Not to mention the heavy number of parents that try to micromanage the cut and start getting pissed because the hair doesn't look right when they're a third or more through the cut.\n\nMy mom has been a cosmetologist for most of my life. She's done everything from the cheap mall salons (anyone old enough to remember that Sears had a salon?), to owning her own shop and everything in between. These days she works in a kids salon. Some of the stories I've heard over the years would make your blood boil while others would just make you shake your head at the rapid decline of human decency.\n\nIt's because of shit like that many cosmetologists have learned to try to be proactive and try to prevent the absurd reactions from parents by keeping them involved in the process. Even then they can't fucking win. You should be grateful that they cared enough to take their time and make sure it was right as most chain salons don't give a shit about quality. They want quantity and pressure their staff to speed through cuts to meet quotas.\n\nI hope you at least tipped them well.

I don\u2019t think I was happy with a haircut because they never did what I asked for. \n\nI hate conflicts and telling people they\u2019re wrong so it was always so extremely uncomfortable for me to go, so I stopped. I learned how to cut my own hair. It might not be perfect every time but it\u2019s better than paying 60-100\u20ac to argue with them and not getting the look I asked for.", "When my friend had short hair, she went to a barber. Said it was 10x easier getting the cut she wanted and was cheaper too!", "I didn't. It sounded more like they didn't want to get chewed out for not giving their daughter \"a more feminine look\" as they almost certainly have been a million times.", "I guess I don't find that scenario likely for a few reasons. \n\nOf course, even asking for INFO about the picture could create a biased response. \n\nSo going by what was already given... \n\n>My girls are 14 and 17. The both have short hair.\n\n>So my 14 year old said she needed a haircut as her hair had grown out for a few months. \n\n>but you could tell daughter 14 already had that cut, it was just grown out.\n\n>The 14-year-old already had the hairstyle she wanted just grown out and just wanted it shortened up *again.*\n\n>Then they tried to change my 14-year-olds to make it look more feminine.

Chances are the picture was something on her phone that she had used to get the previous cut, or a picture of her with the previous cut from social media. \n\nThe 14yo *already* had short hair. The hair style already included an obvious undercut even after a few months. \n\n14yo's hair can grow fast, but not that fast. \n\nChances are all she needed to begin with was 2.5 to 3\" to get back to the previous style. \n\n2\" is also a *huge* discrepancy with short hair. It's the difference between chin and ear length. \n\nAnd for the stylist to say her way is more feminine, that's probably the discrepancy we are talking about. \n\nI find it really hard to believe that a 14yo, who already had the haircut she wanted, it just grew out, would bring in a picture with that much discrepancy. \n\nSure she is 14, but she already had the haircut she wanted. She knew exactly what she wanted. OP says she just wanted the same cut again, not shorter. \n\nThe OP made it abundantly clear that the child was in charge of her hair and the child's opinion was the only one that mattered. The stylist still tried to impose her own viewpoint.", "The same thing happened to me when I tried to get mine cut short at 23. The woman at the salon *refused* to use a trimmer and insisted on scissors, and I was too non confrontational at the time to demand it. She straight up said \u201cOh, you don\u2019t want to look like you went to your boyfriend\u2019s barber\u201d \n\nMa\u2019am. I am gay. That is exactly what I want.

I can understand a little more concern with the younger daughter but the stylist thinking a 17 year old is not going to be specific about what she wants and what she\u2019s willing to look like at school, around other teens is ridiculous. The stylist clearly needed that push to just do her job. \n\nI say this as someone who went to get my hair cut from waist length to chin length. I planned to donate it. I asked the stylist to cut it like the picture I had (of myself) and she took about 6 inches off before brushing the hair off and removing the cape. I asked her why she didn\u2019t finish and she said because that was enough. I paid my bill and asked the stylist standing next to her if I could book an appointment. Surprised she asked when and I said \u201cfirst available booking. Confused she asked what I meant so I asked what she was doing right then. She said nothing so I asked her to put me in the computer for a haircut. She moved slowly and did as I asked. Walked me to her chair and asked how she could help me. I showed her the same picture and asked for that chin length cut. She said ok and started cutting with hesitation. I told her it\u2019s just hair so get rid of it. She did and when it was done it was an amazing cut. My hair is very fine but I have a LOT of it so the floor looked like a massacre. The other stylist was fuming but I paid for the second cut and tipped the stylist. She did an amazing job and it was a lot of work. The first stylist got mad and wanted a tip.

It's cheaper and faster and they do what you actually want and well. I've been seeing my small town UK barber once a month for years. I pay for a 'gentleman's cut' as a woman and he sees no issue with that because that's the cut I want. \nI've had a spiky crew cut and now an undercut and my only problem now is that the top is long enough I probably need a hairdresser to properly shape it just once a year or so.", "NTA.

I get that they want to make sure you're not going to change your mind. \n\nAfter the second time, you checked, do what is asked.", "You were the A for the attitude. Not all mothers are like you and dont let their kids have the hair style then want, so to avoid problems the woman was making sure that you were consenting. Aldo i do think is cool you let your daughter express themselfs.", "Slight AH for snapping a bit but honestly sounds like that\u2019s not a salon you have a report built with so they don\u2019t know how you feel about your children having total reign over their hair. See some parents will say \u201cI don\u2019t care whatever they want\u201d but then would be pissed if their daughter came out of the chair looking like Cindi Lauper with half a shaved head because to them that\u2019s considered super outlandish for a girl and the hair stylist is then berated for not being able to read minds and know that\u2019s how the parent feels or something. Now depending on how the stylist acted with your one kid commenting on what would be more feminine I can\u2019t say if they were judgy with that comment or not since I wasn\u2019t there, but that\u2019s why my overall point matters. Find a place you like, with stylists you like and frequent them so they get to know you and your kids a bit. Knowing your clientele on a more personal level means that the stylist will already know your freedom of expression attitude on hair and will be able to ask for specified questions of your kids based on their hair track record and their general vibe. A good stylist will know more or less what you probably want done with what you currently have, and a great stylist will be able to spitball some ideas that seem at least in your wheelhouse (without being pushy and listening to your ultimate decision obviously). That and ensuring whatever you get done will last as long as possible by providing good care tips. So while this might not be the stylist for you in this instance, shop around a little and you\u2019ll find the spot that can keep tabs on all the details of y\u2019all\u2019s hair care and expression needs", "NAH.", "Sounds like the hairdresser was just being accommodating and covering their ass if you didn\u2019t approve\u2026 but your 14 yr old daughter calling you out for being rude?

They were asking for a style the salon wasn't comfortable with.", ">the stylist objected and said it would be more feminine if it wasn\u2019t shorter.\n\nAnd if the cut is less feminine than a dumb-ass parent realizes it would be, that parent could also use it as a reason to blow up.", "From the title I thought *you* were getting the haircut.  I could relate. Just cut it, let me nap.", "The stylist was likely following the salon rules- most places I have been to make sure to ask consent of a parent or guardian before any drastic changes which it sounds like your girl\u2019s haircuts would qualify as since they involve buzz and undercuts and being very short. They will also ask adult clients several times if they are sure before doing a drastic change because it\u2019s easy to be shocked when you see it in the mirror for the first time. There is an art to cutting short hair well, the salon needs to cover itself so that if the customer isn\u2019t happy then they did already ask permission. \n\nUnless this was a regular salon for your family, which it doesn\u2019t sound like it is, then the stylist doesn\u2019t know that your daughters enjoy short and dramatic hairstyles or that you are comfortable with them doing as they wish with their hair. Since your daughters enjoy having very different hair then I\u2019d suggest their finding a stylist they like and sticking with them so the stylist will know exactly what they like and how to do it plus can suggest other short or dramatic looks which they might really love. In my experience stylists love when a client is open to very different and dramatic looks, it allows them to be creative and do something fun, I\u2019d chalk this up to the stylist not knowing your family rather than being annoying.", "NTA but the stylist may have had some bad experiences with other parents in the past where they repeatedly told them to do what the child wanted only to flip out at the end. But I do see why it would be annoying after several times of saying this.", "You think people haven't been pricks to the hair dresser for illogical reasons before? They just want to cover their bases", "Honestly I\u2019m 100% sure people have complained unreasonably at some point and used the excuse \u201cbut they are under 18, they can\u2019t decide\u201d as a reason not to pay at some salon! Even when it seems absurd, that can happen. Do you know these stylists? They might feel a legitimate need to double check with you. You could avoid in future by maybe making a clear statement upfront that your daughters pick their hairstyle and you\u2019re fine with whatever they do (but kindly to the stylist and not impatient).\n\nThe feminine comment rubs me the wrong way *but* I can also see that coming from some past issues with a customer in theory so it depends. It\u2019s hard to say with minors because I could 100% see some one going off on a stylist because obviously they didn\u2019t want their daughter to have that hair style and they should know not to make it less feminine or whatever, even if the kid has almost the same hair already frankly.", "I get that it is annoying\u2026.but maybe the stylist has cut the hair how the teenager asked before and got crap from the parents. It honestly sounds like she was just protecting herself. Next time just take a moment and explain a bit more why you are okey with what your kids want. It costs nothing to be kind.", "The hair stylist was being extra cautious probably because parents get mad at them. So you got mad at her about it lol", "But for every parent who is like you (and me for that matter, I\u2019ve never understood being controlling about a kid\u2019s hair) there are probably 4-5 who would lose it on the stylist for not doing it their way. \n\nA little empathy for those working in service jobs please.", "After I graduated high school I chopped my hair off. It was mid back to shoulders and my mom cried but she didn\u2019t say boo to me, because it\u2019s my hair ..", "Lots of people will say stuff like this but then act all surprised at the end to try to get out of paying. I\u2019d be willing to be she\u2019s had a more than a few experiences like this. NAH", "You\u2019re pretty cool. NTA", "Put yourself in the stylist's position, though...\n\nIf she doesn't ask, and then the parent has an issue, it can't be sorted after the fact, and would likely cause a scene, and be a big problem. \n\nEasier just to ask, even if it has to be multiple times.", "Not a asshole. Best Mom ever", "Or alternatively, the kind of parent who might blow up might not have realized what the haircut they were approving would look like, and it not being feminine would be a reason in that kind of parent's eyes to get mad.", "yeah, but that's easy for us to say when we're not the one the parent is blowing up at or refusing to pay.", "I know of a few places that won't cut under 16 hair without a parent or adult there. It's mainly for child protection but it also is a CYA policy over hair style as it means the parent is there the whole time - so it's not a surprise.", "I can imagine that scenario as well as the parent not paying attention and becoming furious over the hair cut.", "Nah, stylist is just a sexist prick. Listen to your customers and stop projecting your world views on them.", "NTA\n\nWhat I can't figure out is, why do people who *don't* get the most vanilla ass haircuts keep going into those places?\n\nI would never go back lol", "You were so freaking rude. There was no need for it, they were being cautious and considerate, and you stomped all over their good intentions.", "I was a teenager and I said I don't like blunt ends so could she make the ends come to more of a V shape. Literally had one side about 2 inches longer than the other because she didn't understand, I guess. I went home and immediately fixed it myself. Same place was curling my hair for graduation. The lady doing it left halfway through  and the next lady used completely different products and methods. I haven't paid for someone to touch my hair since. My motto is \"I can fuck it up at home for free\"", "This is why having a 15-30 min consult before your service is so helpful. I\u2019ve figured out over the years that it is SO easy to miscommunicate with your stylist. Having a back and forth about expectations and realistic results helps you feel more apart of the process for sure.", "Ooh are you me. Exactly my issue, from the straight/blunt bangs to layers anywhere. Blunt cut bangs are the only ones that suit, I need the weight for them to sit right, while layers in general make my (already thin) hair flat and gross. Last time I explicitly said what I wanted, showed previous pics from just after a cut, and confirmed all was clear. Dude then picked up the scissors and before I could even comprehend what was happening he\u2019s randomly hacking into one side of my bangs \u201cjust thinning them out!\u201d.  I was absolutely furious and looked patchy and bald for weeks.", "Not a hair stylist, but I've worked with kids aged 03 to ~65, and their parents. \n\nWhen someone, especially a kid wants to do something questionable, double-check.\n\nEven after a double-check, if they don't know me well, and they don't like the outcome they will complain. \n\nThe stylist has probably had a lot of kids, teenagers, or parents say they are okay with a cut, double-check, and then complain the cut isn't *adjective* enough. \n\nIn this case, OP and the kid are okay with it. Others say they are, and maybe they mean it when they said it. But when their hair isn't how they pictured it. They can complain, refuse to pay, to tip, etc. \n\nStylist was covering their ass.

Gen z is the embodiment of the John mulaney joke about someone spilling soup on them and them apologizing to the person who spilled the soup", "Yup! I could tell from the way OP described how the stylist kept asking and checking meant the stylist has had to deal with some crazy customers being too critical and contradictory. Stylist wanted to cover their butt so OP doesn't freak out at them when the haircut is done.", "I have heard stories of the male partners going to the salon to yell at stylists for cutting \u2018their woman\u2019\u2019s hair short or dying it.

But I trust her to do literally whatever she wants to my hair because never once has she overstepped a boundary, never once have I felt pressured, and never once have I walked out of her studio feeling worse than when I came in. I\u2018ve been on a mission to grow my hair long (21 inches from the crown!) and I get trims every two months to keep the ends looking full.", "Confirm yes, once maybe. Not repeatedly. Not after being told over and over again that the one in the chair is the client they have to listen to. At some point it becomes obnoxious.\n\nI get it, I have empathy for the stylists, but it is annoying as fuck to have to keep redirecting the stylist to the person in the chair.", "Yes, this is the part that made the stylist the AH.", "Maybe they didn\u2019t want others to think she looked like a boy?  They were looking out for her?", "Or they\u2019ve experienced women asking for shorter cuts only to complain about it not looking feminine enough, so they wanted to cover their own ass.", "This is exactly what makes the OP NTA here", "No, that's just making sure the clients understand what they're asking for.", "From the way the stylists kept asking OP to be sure if it's ok--especially since they work at a chain salon--tells me they've experienced many instances of other parents blankly telling them to do whatever their child wants then turning around blaming the stylists if the parent doesn't like the end results of the hair cut.  Particularly, if the parent is going to remain present during the hair cut, the stylist is going check in with the parent to be sure what the child wants is ok.  The parent may say whatever their child wants is fine but they most likely experienced parents contracting that through out the haircutting process.  If the stylists didn't check in, the parent will blame the stylist why they didn't say going shorter would make their daughter more masculine looking, their face looks rounder, looks weird, etc.  And, a stylist is going to do their best to provide what their client wants, but will also provide their professional opinion if a client wants to go shorter, etc. to let them know about things they may not realize may occur--like the length may not be very flattering to their face shape, etc.  Since this is a chain salon and it doesn't sound like OP has an established relationship with the stylist, it was probably hard for the stylist to gauge if the parent really means it when they say whatever the child wants so they were extra careful.  But yeah, your suggestion for OP to tell stylists anything their child want and to ask them directly is good.  I'd add that OP could've have then left the salon after saying that so the teens could then deal with the stylist themselves. (Sorry, I didn't mean for this comment to be so long!)", "I'd say that was their professional opinion being offered because some people care about that and it doesn't sound like the stylist and OP has an established relationship for them to know whether that really matters to them.", "Except the daughter, as OP stated in a comment, clearly had that same cut already, it had just grown out. It was misogyny, pure and simple.", "Yes, exactly, because it doesn't sound like there is an established relationship between OP and stylist.  Stylist doesn't know if they've considered if it's too feminine or masculine or if that is an issue they care about; hence, stylist provided their opinion.", "I am so glad to hear someone else say this.  I constantly have hairdressers giving me the haircut they think I should have instead of the one I am asking for, no matter how explicit with directions or how many pictures I have.

I would assure them they really couldn't go too short and yet they'd always wimp out until I'd get frustrated and say it was good enough just to get out of there. Now I just cut my own.
