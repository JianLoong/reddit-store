Blonde, tall, slim, big boobs ect.\n\nShe never dated anyone in high school which was weird to me because almost everyone in our school did, including myself.  When we were in college and she was still turning guys down I asked her why and she said she wants someone who is financially stable.  I laughed it off at the time.  I should also mention she grew up poor, as in her mother was going to the food bank poor.\n\nAfter we graduated, she got a job at a gym teaching Yoga, I continued my education to be a teacher.  She eventually met someone at the gym and he's RICH, like I can't even comprehend the kind of money this guy has.  Fast forward to now, they're married, with two kids and I believe she signed a prenup when they married.\n\nWe were out to dinner on the Saturday that just passed with two other friends from college, and she wanted to go to a very expensive place.  Her treat.  She does this a lot.   Flaunts her money, clothes, trips ect ect.  I always try to smile and ignore it but it was been slowly bothering me.  The dinner was going fine until one of our friends \"Amanda\" asked \"Jill\" what she was planned for her birthday.  \"Jill\" said her and her husband are going to Greece for 3 weeks.  \"Amanda\" and \"Sharon\" both made comments about how nice and lovely that is and I kind of scoffed at it.\n\nWhen \"Jill\" asked me what was wrong...I admittedly lost it.  I told her I'm tired of her faulting her money at everyone all the time and everyone knows she only married her husband for money.  It got really quiet for a couple of seconds and to my surprise \"Jill\" very calmly asked if thats what everyone really thought.  I said yes.  \"Jill\" then asked if it was at all possible that she initially dated him for his money but fell in love with him along the way.  Both our other friends said \"of course\" at the same time I said \"no\".  I told her she fell in love with what he can provide for her.\n\nShe then asked me if I love what my boyfriend provides for me, which I was was different because I never started dating him for those things.  She countered that with \"of course you did, if you were just attracted to him but he wasn't loving, providing, caring, you wouldn't still be in a relationship with him and if you were it would be an unhappy and unhealthy one\"  I argued its still not the same thing.\n\nShe then stood up and said she has other places to be and not to worry about the bill.  She left and the three of us finished our meal in silence.  When the server came around, he handed me the bill FOR MY MEAL ONLY.  She paid for herself and  the other two but left me to pay for an almost $50 meal that I really couldn't afford.\n\nI texted her and called her an asshole, she replied saying not to message her again until I apologize for my earlier comments.

Who's the gold digger now?\n\nYou did a lot of things wrong but at the end of the day you can learn from it. It's best that you see your negative opinions aren't facts, they are just one of many ways you can interprete a situation. You see her answering a question about what she's doing on her birthday as \"flaunting\", many people (including your other friends) see it as her answering an normal question truthfully. \n\nDo some self reflection and don't take your issues out on others, because that makes you an asshole.\n\n(Just putting it out there, this is very similar to a post about a jealous friend and an expensive wedding dress from yesterday)", "YTA. Jill could not have handled that situation more perfectly. She is not only more beautiful than you and wealthier than you, she has more class in her pinky finger than you possess in your entire body. And the jealousy is consuming you. That must be a terrible way to live.", "YTA - You sound insanely jealous of Jill. Her \"flaunting her money\" is just her (trying) to buy you lunch. She didn't bring up money. You and your friends did. She tried to do something nice for you, you blew up at her for no reason, and so she left you with the bill.", "Jealous much ?

She offered to take you out to lunch that\u2019s hardly flaunting it.  I\u2019d have made you also pay.  You insulted her in more ways than one.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA. You come across as jealous.

You seem to have a lot of animosity towards her.", "YTA\n\nJealousy is ugly.", "YTA, you're petty and jealous and not a good friend.  She should axe you from her life,  she doesn't need your toxic bullshit", "YTA. You seem perfectly happy with accepting her gifts under the guise of being her friend while also not actually liking her. Maybe you're a gold digger in this friendship?\n\nGood for her for defending her relationship. Why does it matter to you if she's happy? It doesn't sound like there's any manipulation or abuse happening here, so what's the problem?", "YTA. Why do you spend time with her if her life choices bother you so much? And then to have the nerve to get pissed at her when she won\u2019t pay for your lunch???", "YTA, and a terrible friend. You like her money when she's paying for YOU, but otherwise want her to be broke? Get some therapy, other people living their lives should not make you this jealous.", "YTA. You came at your friend out of the blue simply because she said her husband was taking her to a Greece for a 3 week vacation.  Jealous much?", "YTA for yelling at her for not paying for *YOUR* meal after you insulted her for paying for you and your friends.\n\ni dont think you're inherently asshole for thinking she married her husband for the money. you're entitled to have your opinion, badly informed opinion since it seems like you never talked together about it.\n\nbut you're definitely TA for the way you presented your opinion on her relationship. you couldve said it way more nicely while still get your point across.\n\nbut lady, youre almost 40 why were you reacting like 13yo girl?", "YTA and a jealous loser at that!!!!! 39 y/o and a $50 lunch breaks the bank? Maybe you should have been smarter, like Jill. LOL", "Not dating was her choice. Knowing what she was looking for was smart. Growing up financially unstable is fucking awful. I grew up that way and financial stability is still always, always on my mind. I am not rich but I fought really hard for stability. \n\nYou didn\u2019t give any actual examples of her flaunting her wealth so I am going to assume it\u2019s a lot of things coming up and Jill being truthful. Sort of like the Greece thing. Answering a question honestly when someone asks is not flaunting. \n\nIf you cannot afford a restaurant do you make a different suggestion? Or do you just let her treat and quietly fume about it over the fancy napkins? \n\nJill chose a different path. Dating in high school is not a requirement. Financial stability was important so she prioritized that. \n\nYour jealousy isn\u2019t cute. YTA", "YTA. So you have issues with her \"flaunting\" her money when she spends it on you, and you have issues with her \"flaunting\" her money when she doesn't spend it on you. Mmkay. I think you just have issues.", "You sound jealous. I like the part about the mom going to food pantry. I think your mad it isn't you since you clearly grew up with more than she did. I grew up poor. It led me to be responsible with my assets. Yea. You a jealous shitty friend. Jealous of the looks and the money.", "Of course YTA. Offering to treat friends to a meal occasionally is certainly not \u2018flaunting\u2019 anything, get a grip.", "Lol you're the asshole and you know it, and to try and say anything otherwise is delusional. Jealousy doesn't look good on you babe, grow up.", "YTA and Jill is a fucking legend for paying only for her  two actual friends. \n\nAlso, who the fuck has the balls to have a huge argument with their friend during lunch, then continue to order a meal? I would be absolutely mortified and probably leave the restaurant instead.", "YTA. Wow what an outburst, her life choices put her in the position she is in if you wish you done the same you should not take your regret out on her", "YTA. Your post screams angry and jealous. Even if she married for money, what do you care? Her marriage is her business. You also gave no examples of flaunting wealth. She spends money on her friends and spoke about a trip that someone asked her about.", "YTA. This is the weirdest behaviour i have seen, go to expensive restaurants with her and use her money and then complain that shes a golddigger when she talks about her vacation?\n\nYou also mention that its weird that she didnt date in high school because she was looking for someone that fits her preferences, why is this a weird trait in any way?? \n\nOP your definitely the AH here.", "LMAO", "YTA. Why are you friends with her and going out with her if you really don't like her? Oh, and you started crap with her at dinner, then got mad when she didn't pay for it?? What the hell?", "Oh honey, jealousy doesn't look good on anyone and it's looking particularly bad on you.  You owe this person (you aren't her friend so let's just get that out there right now) an apology and yourself some serious self reflection.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, it was wrong that Jill only started dating him for the money, that\u2019s gross. But Jill loves him, has a family with him, and got a great life because of him so of course she brags about what he can do for her. You are jealous, the concerns would be much more valid if Jill did only nice things for HERSELF and only bragged about HERSELF but it seems she enjoys treating her friends and talking about how great her family is.", "YTA if you think she\u2019s always flaunting her wealth why do you mooch off her when she invites your broke ass to dinner. Mind your business next time and be happy that your friends are doing well. You seem to benefit from her being rich so what\u2019s the problem?", "YTA\n\nYou sound super jealous. \n\nOn the flip side, she stop \"flaunting\" her money to you. She allowed you to pay your own bill,", "YTA and a hypocritical one at that. She\u2019s a gold digger bc she treats her friends to lunch and you have such a problem with that you got a meal you can\u2019t afford bc you assumed she\u2019d pay LMAO", "The moment I saw the title I knew of course YTA. You sound extremely jealous of Jill. You're jealous because she's beautiful, you're jealous because even though she grew up poor she married someone who was financially stable which is all she ever wanted. You and the guy who's jealous of his coworker because he's gone to 150 countries should get together and commiserate on your jealousy. \nI'm so glad Jill didn't allow you to be an AH and still pay for your meal.\n\nYou probably thought you were better than her just because you didn't grow up poor and went to college to become a teacher. Jealousy is a disease that will eat you up until you're ugly and empty inside. Get well soon.", "YTA and obviously very jealous of her. You can\u2019t be happy for your friend because her husband is taking her on vacation? She was asked what her biplans were, and she answered. That is not flaunting.", "YTA\n\nYou should be prepared to cover your own tab. You don't get to call her out, then use her like that.", "YTA \n\nYou let your obvious jealousy spill over into the dinner and your friend was not having it", "YTA. Doesn't seem like she's flaunting any of her wealth at all. She's being cared for and she's caring for her friends. You reek of jealousy and anger. Also makes me wonder who the gold digger is when she takes you out and you order $50 on her dime. Do better.", "Ew YTA and have a gross attitude. You even tried to speak on behalf of others when she asked if others felt that way and you said yes\u2026. with others sitting right there!\n\nIf I was her I would\u2019ve cut all ties with you and blocked your number immediately.", "YTA - You're jealousy is showing. Also you expected her to pay for your meal after those rude comments and actually got mad that she didn't? Lmao way to complain and look down on someone for having money but then when she didn't pay for you, you turn around and get pissy about it, you're not entitled to her money for the free meal that you literally complained about her 'flaunting'. Also your 2 other friends did not say anything and ate in silence after she left meaning they know your an AH for saying such things and no one agreed with you.", "YTA - And I hope Jill knows that you are not her friend.", "YTA and a shit friend. Why can\u2019t you be happy for her? Sounds like you need to do a LOT of self-care and I wish you all the best on this journey of introspection.", "Jealous much? YTA", "YTA - and you reek of jealousy.", "Yta. And if you feel this way, why are you friends? And she's 100% right. Its not *just* attraction that goes into any romantic relationship.  And just because she wanted different things than you want out of yours, doesn't mean she doesn't love him.\n\nEta.

She had high standards and met them. A gold digger is a 19 married to a 60 year old for money.

None of this is overly ostentatious, by the way. \n\nShe grew up in poverty so of course finances were going to matter to her more than you. BUT she is totally right - if he wasn't a good caring person, she wouldn't have gotten married to him. \n\nAnyhow - I am glad that you showed your true colours and she can get rid of a hater in her life.

Unless you think Jill is planning to kill him for insurance money, why in the world would a gold-digger sign a prenup? Your bitterness & jealousy are toxic & ugly. Jill handled this entire situation PERFECTLY! Like, chef\u2019s kiss, mic drop, shut it down perfectly.

That's like 1 Applebee's entree anyway lol. Neither is a trip to Greece really. She may be better off than you, but she's not rubbing anything in your face.

Sorry she got a different job than you did, and enjoyed it.  Sorry she met somebody that ticked her checkboxes.  Sorry they're married, and have children.  Sorry she decided to treat you and your other friends to dinner.  Sorry she's nice to you.  Sorry she gets to travel when you don't.  Sorry you're not happy with your own boyfriend.\n\nBut whatever is going on in your life that you're unhappy with, it's your responsibility to either fix, or come to terms with.  That is literally the only way you can ever be happy in life; decide what's worth fixing, then do the work, and decide what's not actually that important, and let it go.\n\nBeing jealous of other people will guarantee you a life of misery.", "Not only are YTA but you just did yourself out of a lovely, generous friend because of petty jealousy", "YTA.

Even if Jill married her partner for money, that's not your business.  If it's so morally reprehensible to you, stop being Jill's \"friend\" and letting her take you out to free meals.\n\nYou are making a lot of assumptions in this post.  I saw no flaunting of her money.  You assume you can speak for your whole social circle and tell her \"everyone\" thinks she's a gold digger, when your other friends don't seem to agree.  You assume you know her relationship with her husband better than she does herself.\n\nYou're jealous, spend that energy on improving your life rather than destroying a friendship just because your friend has it better than you do.", "YTA and clearly seething with jealousy.

You sound like you might still be stuck in high school given your attention to detail in the beginning of your post.", "YTA and so jealous. Jill's handling of the situation was so classy and way more gracious than you deserved.", "Envy is a dangerous feeling. \n\nFunny how she said she didn't want to settle, one day long ago....that she wanted someone financially STABLE (Stable and rich have 2 different meanings) which is valid due to her childhood struggles....why shouldn't she want more in life?\nDidn't sleep or date around....just waited. Met a man that happens to be rich....married and had kids with him. They are still married.....and going on trips so possibly happily married at that. She treats all of her friends to meals....that's not flaunting. She answered a specific question that led to yall knowing her husband is taking her away for her birthday....just answering honestly.....also not flaunting. You disrespected her publicly and in front of friends, tried to get them to join in....bully behavior, called her out of her name....btw, you haven't shown anywhere where she ever behaved like a gold digger other than her admitting she initially dated him for his financial status and even that is a small reach, she handles your disrespect with grace and dignity and then you stay and eat the expensive food you thought was free for you and get mad that you must pay your own way? Seriously?! You sound like such a gem \ud83d\ude44", "YTA\nIn addition to the jealousy I am picking up a lot of pick me vibes.

You are jealous of Jill so much is dripping from my phone. Its also cute how you think you can insult her constantly but still feel entitled to her money", ">she wants someone who is financially stable.\n\nMost people want someone who is financially stable. This is not odd at all. \n\n>her mother was going to the food bank poor.\n\nThis makes it actually scary for her to date someone without financial stability. She wants her kids to have a better more stable life than she had. \n\n>she wanted to go to a very expensive place. Her treat. She does this a lot\n\nSo she wanted her friends yo experience the food there, and knew you couldn't  pay. She was generous.\n\n>Flaunts her money, clothes, trips ect ect.\n\nYou mean she lives a lifestyle she can afford, but you cannot. And you condemn her for it. \n\n>I believe she signed a prenup when they married.\n\nSo she is not out to marry him, get divorced, and take his money, like you enjoy thinking. \n\n>. \"Jill\" said her and her husband are going to Greece for 3 weeks. \"Amanda\" and \"Sharon\" both made comments about how nice and lovely that is and I kind of scoffed at it.\n\nThey were friends being excited for a friend. You were wondering how this girl, that was so much \"less\" than you in high school, deserves so much more than you know. \n\n>. I told her I'm tired of her faulting her money at everyone all the time and everyone knows she only married her husband for money.\n\nFlaunting her money would be saying I am going to eat at this 5 star restaurant that you can't afford. I will see you later. Or asking if you got your new dress at Walmart. \n\nAlso, she was very choosy in who she dated. Money was only one thing on her list. It helped attract her to him, but that doesn't mean she doesn't love him. \n\n>provide for her.\n\n>She then asked me if I love what my boyfriend provides for me, which I was was different because I never started dating him for those things.\n\nBut in a non-financial relationship,  what your bf brings to the table still matters to you. Why is it wrong for that to matter to her? \n\n>, if you were just attracted to him but he wasn't loving, providing, caring, you wouldn't still be in a relationship with him and if you were it would be an unhappy and unhealthy one\" I argued its still not the same thing.\n\nSo there ARE other qualities she demands of a man she dates! You just refuse to see that. \n\n>When the server came around, he handed me the bill FOR MY MEAL ONLY. She paid for herself and the other two but left me to pay for an almost $50 meal that I really couldn't afford.\n\nSo she was trying to provide for you something you could not afford on you own. You just made it into something offensive. So she left you on your own.\n\nThen you texted she is an asshole? Because she didn't want to pay for someone that insulted her, her husband, and their marriage. \n\nFace it, you are very jealous of her situation. You wish you had the money, too. Money is a part of her life now. It was opposite in school, but she never held it against you. Yet, you secretly despise her for doing better than ypu without having to go to college. \n\nI believe in her gym she likely had several men after her. She chose one she liked, and grew to love him. There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nYta", "YTA - Wow, can't believe you actually posted this. You sound jealous. Her relationship is non of your business, just be happy for her. You never look into someone else's bowl to see if they have more than you, just to make sure they have enough. You yelled at her at a lunch she was paying for for gods sake. She's better off without you.", "YTA. \nSounds like you\u2019re still only Jill\u2019s friend because she has money. \nYou have a problem with the way she acts, but you don\u2019t mind going to eat on her dime? \nYou\u2019re the gold digger in this relationship, not her. \nJill did the right thing by leaving you with your check.", "You just sound jealous and hateful and mean. And every opportunity you had to stop and think about the points she was making- you just doubled down. And then you wrote all this, posted it, and honestly expected people to agree with you. It blows my mind. YTA. Big time. She deserves a better best friend. I hope you do some serious soul searching and self reflection- because you need help. She didn't flaunt anything. She said what her plans were. That's it.", "YTA and jealous af. You are initially invited to a meal and then showed your ugly face. Good riddance for Jill because I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like you either.", "Keep your jealousy in check. YTA this woman has done nothing wrong by how you describe it.

This judgement is so obvious... are you sure you aren't \"jill\" writing this?\n\nShe handled it like a mature adult, You were just a jealous friend. I see nothing wrong with what she did. Gold digging means you are with someone JUST for their money. \n\nIf money is one requirement, but not the sole reason, that's not gold digging. That's just having a standard. Sounds like if you cannot afford a 50$ meal, you aren't doing well financially - which can explain why you are so jealous.", "Definitely the A-hole", "Jill is me because I absolutely would do that", "YTA.\n\nJill doesn't even sound like she was \"flaunting\" her money, she just wanted to treat her friends to a nice meal.\n\nYou sound incredibly jealous. Also, $50 isn't that much for a meal. Get your money up.", "OP clearly doesn't think too highly, or care much, about this so-called friend.

Maybe stuff is missing, but I don't see Jill flaunting money. She has the means, so she wants to treat her friends (If Jill didn't treat, I wonder if OP would be complaining that her rich friend is being stingy with her money).

She invites you to expensive places and offers to pay. She talks about a trip she is going on.   \n\n\nI'm guessing it feels like flaunting because you have it tougher financially, since you say paying $50 for a meal is more than you can afford.

You should apologize to your friend.", "Yeah, I feel like it would be more of a \u201cflaunt\u201d if Jill had said something like \u201cI know what what he\u2019s getting me, but I don\u2019t want to say what it was because OP would get jealous\u201d\n\nShe was asked, she answered.
