Blonde, tall, slim, big boobs ect.\n\nShe never dated anyone in high school which was weird to me because almost everyone in our school did, including myself.  When we were in college and she was still turning guys down I asked her why and she said she wants someone who is financially stable.  I laughed it off at the time.  I should also mention she grew up poor, as in her mother was going to the food bank poor.\n\nAfter we graduated, she got a job at a gym teaching Yoga, I continued my education to be a teacher.  She eventually met someone at the gym and he's RICH, like I can't even comprehend the kind of money this guy has.  Fast forward to now, they're married, with two kids and I believe she signed a prenup when they married.\n\nWe were out to dinner on the Saturday that just passed with two other friends from college, and she wanted to go to a very expensive place.  Her treat.  She does this a lot.   Flaunts her money, clothes, trips ect ect.  I always try to smile and ignore it but it was been slowly bothering me.  The dinner was going fine until one of our friends \"Amanda\" asked \"Jill\" what she was planned for her birthday.  \"Jill\" said her and her husband are going to Greece for 3 weeks.  \"Amanda\" and \"Sharon\" both made comments about how nice and lovely that is and I kind of scoffed at it.\n\nWhen \"Jill\" asked me what was wrong...I admittedly lost it.  I told her I'm tired of her faulting her money at everyone all the time and everyone knows she only married her husband for money.  It got really quiet for a couple of seconds and to my surprise \"Jill\" very calmly asked if thats what everyone really thought.  I said yes.  \"Jill\" then asked if it was at all possible that she initially dated him for his money but fell in love with him along the way.  Both our other friends said \"of course\" at the same time I said \"no\".  I told her she fell in love with what he can provide for her.\n\nShe then asked me if I love what my boyfriend provides for me, which I was was different because I never started dating him for those things.  She countered that with \"of course you did, if you were just attracted to him but he wasn't loving, providing, caring, you wouldn't still be in a relationship with him and if you were it would be an unhappy and unhealthy one\"  I argued its still not the same thing.\n\nShe then stood up and said she has other places to be and not to worry about the bill.  She left and the three of us finished our meal in silence.  When the server came around, he handed me the bill FOR MY MEAL ONLY.  She paid for herself and  the other two but left me to pay for an almost $50 meal that I really couldn't afford.\n\nI texted her and called her an asshole, she replied saying not to message her again until I apologize for my earlier comments.  I admit I might have been too hard but I don't think I'm wrong.

Who's the gold digger now?\n\nYou did a lot of things wrong but at the end of the day you can learn from it. It's best that you see your negative opinions aren't facts, they are just one of many ways you can interprete a situation. You see her answering a question about what she's doing on her birthday as \"flaunting\", many people (including your other friends) see it as her answering an normal question truthfully. \n\nDo some self reflection and don't take your issues out on others, because that makes you an asshole.\n\n(Just putting it out there, this is very similar to a post about a jealous friend and an expensive wedding dress from yesterday)", "YTA. Jill could not have handled that situation more perfectly. She is not only more beautiful than you and wealthier than you, she has more class in her pinky finger than you possess in your entire body. And the jealousy is consuming you. That must be a terrible way to live.\n\nEdit: thank you for the kind words and awards!

She offered to take you out to lunch that\u2019s hardly flaunting it.  I\u2019d have made you also pay.  You insulted her in more ways than one.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA. You come across as jealous. I don\u2019t think you really like this girl so I think you should reconsider hanging out with her. You seem to have a lot of animosity towards her.", "YTA\n\nJealousy is ugly.", "YTA, you're petty and jealous and not a good friend.  She should axe you from her life,  she doesn't need your toxic bullshit", "[deleted]", "YTA. Why do you spend time with her if her life choices bother you so much? And then to have the nerve to get pissed at her when she won\u2019t pay for your lunch???", "YTA, and a terrible friend. You like her money when she's paying for YOU, but otherwise want her to be broke? Get some therapy, other people living their lives should not make you this jealous.", "YTA. You came at your friend out of the blue simply because she said her husband was taking her to a Greece for a 3 week vacation.  Jealous much?", "YTA for yelling at her for not paying for *YOUR* meal after you insulted her for paying for you and your friends.\n\ni dont think you're inherently asshole for thinking she married her husband for the money. you're entitled to have your opinion, badly informed opinion since it seems like you never talked together about it.\n\nbut you're definitely TA for the way you presented your opinion on her relationship. you couldve said it way more nicely while still get your point across.\n\nbut lady, youre almost 40 why were you reacting like 13yo girl?", "YTA and a jealous loser at that!!!!! 39 y/o and a $50 lunch breaks the bank? Maybe you should have been smarter, like Jill. LOL", "Not dating was her choice. Knowing what she was looking for was smart. Growing up financially unstable is fucking awful. I grew up that way and financial stability is still always, always on my mind. I am not rich but I fought really hard for stability. \n\nYou didn\u2019t give any actual examples of her flaunting her wealth so I am going to assume it\u2019s a lot of things coming up and Jill being truthful. Sort of like the Greece thing. Answering a question honestly when someone asks is not flaunting. \n\nIf you cannot afford a restaurant do you make a different suggestion? Or do you just let her treat and quietly fume about it over the fancy napkins? \n\nJill chose a different path. Dating in high school is not a requirement. Financial stability was important so she prioritized that. \n\nYour jealousy isn\u2019t cute. YTA", "YTA. So you have issues with her \"flaunting\" her money when she spends it on you, and you have issues with her \"flaunting\" her money when she doesn't spend it on you. Mmkay. I think you just have issues.", "You sound jealous. I like the part about the mom going to food pantry. I think your mad it isn't you since you clearly grew up with more than she did. I grew up poor. It led me to be responsible with my assets. Yea. You a jealous shitty friend. Jealous of the looks and the money.", "Of course YTA. Offering to treat friends to a meal occasionally is certainly not \u2018flaunting\u2019 anything, get a grip.", "Lol you're the asshole and you know it, and to try and say anything otherwise is delusional. Jealousy doesn't look good on you babe, grow up.", "YTA and Jill is a fucking legend for paying only for her  two actual friends. \n\nAlso, who the fuck has the balls to have a huge argument with their friend during lunch, then continue to order a meal? I would be absolutely mortified and probably leave the restaurant instead.", "YTA. Wow what an outburst, her life choices put her in the position she is in if you wish you done the same you should not take your regret out on her", "YTA. Your post screams angry and jealous. Even if she married for money, what do you care? Her marriage is her business. You also gave no examples of flaunting wealth. She spends money on her friends and spoke about a trip that someone asked her about.", "YTA. This is the weirdest behaviour i have seen, go to expensive restaurants with her and use her money and then complain that shes a golddigger when she talks about her vacation?\n\nYou also mention that its weird that she didnt date in high school because she was looking for someone that fits her preferences, why is this a weird trait in any way?? \n\nOP your definitely the AH here.", "LMAO", "YTA. Why are you friends with her and going out with her if you really don't like her? Oh, and you started crap with her at dinner, then got mad when she didn't pay for it?? What the hell?", "Oh honey, jealousy doesn't look good on anyone and it's looking particularly bad on you.  You owe this person (you aren't her friend so let's just get that out there right now) an apology and yourself some serious self reflection.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, it was wrong that Jill only started dating him for the money, that\u2019s gross. But Jill loves him, has a family with him, and got a great life because of him so of course she brags about what he can do for her. You are jealous, the concerns would be much more valid if Jill did only nice things for HERSELF and only bragged about HERSELF but it seems she enjoys treating her friends and talking about how great her family is.", "YTA if you think she\u2019s always flaunting her wealth why do you mooch off her when she invites your broke ass to dinner. Mind your business next time and be happy that your friends are doing well. You seem to benefit from her being rich so what\u2019s the problem?", "YTA\n\nYou sound super jealous. \n\nOn the flip side, she stop \"flaunting\" her money to you. She allowed you to pay your own bill,", "YTA and a hypocritical one at that. She\u2019s a gold digger bc she treats her friends to lunch and you have such a problem with that you got a meal you can\u2019t afford bc you assumed she\u2019d pay LMAO", "The moment I saw the title I knew of course YTA. You sound extremely jealous of Jill. You're jealous because she's beautiful, you're jealous because even though she grew up poor she married someone who was financially stable which is all she ever wanted. You and the guy who's jealous of his coworker because he's gone to 150 countries should get together and commiserate on your jealousy. \nI'm so glad Jill didn't allow you to be an AH and still pay for your meal.\n\nYou probably thought you were better than her just because you didn't grow up poor and went to college to become a teacher. Jealousy is a disease that will eat you up until you're ugly and empty inside. Get well soon.", "YTA and obviously very jealous of her. You can\u2019t be happy for your friend because her husband is taking her on vacation? She was asked what her biplans were, and she answered. That is not flaunting.", "YTA\n\nYou should be prepared to cover your own tab. You don't get to call her out, then use her like that.", "YTA \n\nYou let your obvious jealousy spill over into the dinner and your friend was not having it", "YTA. Doesn't seem like she's flaunting any of her wealth at all. She's being cared for and she's caring for her friends. You reek of jealousy and anger. Also makes me wonder who the gold digger is when she takes you out and you order $50 on her dime. Do better.", "Ew YTA and have a gross attitude. You even tried to speak on behalf of others when she asked if others felt that way and you said yes\u2026. with others sitting right there!\n\nIf I was her I would\u2019ve cut all ties with you and blocked your number immediately.", "YTA - You're jealousy is showing. Also you expected her to pay for your meal after those rude comments and actually got mad that she didn't? Lmao way to complain and look down on someone for having money but then when she didn't pay for you, you turn around and get pissy about it, you're not entitled to her money for the free meal that you literally complained about her 'flaunting'. Also your 2 other friends did not say anything and ate in silence after she left meaning they know your an AH for saying such things and no one agreed with you.", "YTA - And I hope Jill knows that you are not her friend.", "YTA and a shit friend.

BUT she is totally right - if he wasn't a good caring person, she wouldn't have gotten married to him. \n\nAnyhow - I am glad that you showed your true colours and she can get rid of a hater in her life.

I told her I'm tired of her faulting her money at everyone all the time and everyone knows she only married her husband for money.\n\nFlaunting her money would be saying I am going to eat at this 5 star restaurant that you can't afford. I will see you later. Or asking if you got your new dress at Walmart. \n\nAlso, she was very choosy in who she dated. Money was only one thing on her list.

I have a friend that family became wealthy over the last 30 years.

Also, it\u2019s absolutely 0% your business WHY she married husband. Zero. Percent. You owe her - and the others there - massive apologies, but don\u2019t be shocked if they\u2019re not accepted or even acknowledged. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want a friend like you in my life.\n\nAlso: The word is flaunting, not faulting.", "YTA.\n\nFlaunting her money? She takes you and others out.

It isn't a good look", "YTA- Ma\u2019am, asking for financial stability with your partner is a big deal for her because she came from financial instability. She found a husband that makes her happy and is financially stable. She is now doing things she couldn\u2019t as a kid( like most adults that grew up poor.) She signed a prenup, meaning she didn\u2019t really care about the amount of money he made.", "YTA \nUnfortunately, you are jealous and do not see it. Jill didn't say: hey friends, my family and I are going on yet another long, expensive vacation you can not afford. She answered another friend's questions.\n\nI have a sibling who is that kind of wealthy. When my sibling wants to do something with me and is also willing to pay, I am grateful. Or I don't go if I can't be grateful. Instead of enjoying the treat of good restraunts, you wouldn't normally get to try, you are wasting energy being mad that your friend has this as an option. \n\nAlso, there is nothing wrong with taking a pragmatic approach to relationships. Love and security are not mutually exclusive. Love without security is hard, and it frequently doesn't work out because you are too tired to make it work. If Jill is providing her husband with what he wants and needs in a wife and visa versa and they are happy, what is the problem? All relationships have understood or unspoken rules.

Well you were benefiting from the fact she married the wealthy guy, but not anymore. I bet if you do apologize she's not going to take up paying for you anymore so you screwed the pooch on that one.

In Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth is telling Jane if she wants to marry for love make sure she falls in love with a wealthy man. They're joking about it but that's basically what your friend did. She knew what she wanted and she held out for it yes it's a big gold diggery but she was open about it. How or why she married a wealthy guy is really none of your business as is if she signed a prenup or not I'm sure she had to, if the guy was smart. But like that first comment said you can't have it both ways you can't bash her for it then expect her to pay for your lunch at a fancy restaurant. If you couldn't afford to be there you shouldn't have gone just in case she says one day oh I forgot my credit card or oh my husband told me I have to cut back on my spending so I'm sorry I won't be able to cover lunch for any of you.

She's pretty clear about the fact that the first thing she looks for in a guy is how much money she makes. Also similar story in terms of being good looking. Your friend's dating choices and who she ended up with, as well as her now \"flaunting\" her wealth is all a result of the insecurity of having grown up poor. She wants the validation that she's made it now.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have your own insecurities around having a friend who was better looking than you and was able to essentially end up more financially successful than you because of it. You worked hard for your career, she just used her looks to marry rich, and yet she can afford to treat your entire friend group to a dinner you had a hard time affording for just yourself. I can't imagine that being an easy thing to deal with either.\n\nBut YTA for lashing out at your friend like this. She grew up with different advantages and disadvantages than you. Life isn't fair. You're supposed to look at what you have in your life, be grateful for the things you have, and work for the things you want to have.

Would you rather have grown up on food stamps so you could one day trade in your looks to be a trophy wife? From the sounds of it you have a loving relationship and a good career, which is a lot more stable of an option than being a trophy wife for a rich guy (rich men who want trophy wives usually don't want the same one for the rest of their life). Look at your life and be grateful for what you have rather than wishing your friends didn't have what they have.

Not a large or expensive home but still- at 21 he was able to get a bank to loan him money for a mortgage! I'd never even paid rent and here he owns a whole ass house.\n\nAt the point when we started dating he was already on the starting rung of his chosen career. But before he able to get hired, he worked a full time job during the week. Went to school full time and had a part time job on the weekends. At the time he was also married and I don't think she worked. If she did it was only part time. All that and the only debt he had was the mortgage and a car payment.\n\nThe monetary value of the house or the size of his income wasn't important. It just revealed his character. Someone who will set a hard/lofty goal and worked his butt off to achieve it. Someone who took care of his business and made sure all his bills were paid. Someone so stable and fiscally responsible that a bank was willing to loan him a chunk of change. I mean, in a lot of places you can't even rent a car or a hotel room if you're under 25.\n\nIt he had still been living in his parents home working a fast food job with no career goals would I have dated him? Probably. Would I have said yes when he proposed after only 4 months of dating? Hell no. Would we have stayed together and gotten married? Maybe, but most likely not. It probably would have been a really fun fling and then moved on.\n\nMaybe about a year later my best friend from High School started dating a guy that was at least 5 years older than her. He was settled in his careee, owned a home, etc. Know why she broke up with him? He was too stable. In particular the already owning a house. \n\nShe thought a couple should by their first house together but he already had one. I get it if there's a worry about it being HIS house and never becoming THEIR house. I pointed out to her that down the line they could sell the house and buy one they chose as a couple. But she thought a couple should experience the first house hunting and the very first home purchase together. She proceeded to break up with him.\n\nWhat I said to her was \"Seriously???\".

How dumb can you be and WTF is wrong with you????\".", "The main issue I\u2019ve encountered is where to actually go.
