Your school counselor should be able to help you navigate this situation with your attendance and missed assignments. F the school council that shit is meaningless once you graduate.", "NTA. Oh my gosh OP, you have been carrying such a burden for so long. What are these people thinking? You had primary care for your dying brother, and they are worried you skipped a term! First, you are not to blame for your brother's death, he was ill, that illness was going to kill him, and in his last months his sister put a halt on her own life to care for him. He will have felt that love, and he will have been so greatly comforted by it. Your school, your friends and especially your parents should be supporting you, comforting you, thanking you for your love and the care you gave to Lucas. Now you must try to get back into your life again. But you will need help. Talk to the school counsellor, tell them what has been happening. They may well have access to therapists who can help you work through your feelings. They will sort out the stupid school council, get it off your back. \"Irresponsible and unreasonable?\". For shame, that person has no idea what you have been through and has no business talking to you like that. OP, you are a wonderful person and a loving sister and daughter. I applaud you, and wish you all the very best. You deserve it.", "NTA and your school supervisor is a dick. See to it to get some support or mental health professional if necessary, because you blame yourself when there is nothing to blame, it just sucks. And i am sorry your brother died :(\n\nTechnically however, your supervisor is right that you should have stepped down from your office (even if temporarily). Politicans fo it, so why not you. But this is more of a technicality and not really relevant for the issue at hand.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents should have contacted the school. It's also very possible that they handled the whole situation of you taking care of your brother poorly, but you didn't give enough information on that.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "I presume that the SC knew about your brother, in which case they are the AH.\nI'm sorry for your loss.\nI suggest you speak with the school's councillor as you need help.\nI know of a similar case and it almost didn't end well as the trauma and grief were never treated on time.\nNTA", "NTA - fuck the student council, they're suffering from a deplorable lack of empathy and understanding. They could use some mediation and sensitivity training, report them to your guidance counselor. I'm honestly surprised the school didn't identify your truancy sooner- if they can't be bothered about your attendance for three months, I wouldn't worry too much about their scolding. It sounds like it was important for you to spend that time with your brother, and I doubt you'll regret that later in life. Good for you for prioritizing your needs, I am so sorry for your loss, honey. Hang in there.", "I don't know what it's like where you are but most hospitals in the UK offer bereavement support for family members. There are also charities that specialise in this too is money if a worry. You've had to grow up far too fast. Don't isolate yourself from the people who love you.", "Geezus. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and the insensitive adults around you. Everything will get better. Promise", "This seems too fantastic to be real and true.", "I am begging you to call out this school by name. Everyone needs to know how selfish and unsympathetic they are. NTA", "TA. I am in no way invalidating what happened to you but you could've reached out. You could've told them that you would be distant so they wouldn't be left worrying about you.
