If you went back to eating the same way you did before you lost the weight, you'd gain it all back. It's a bit of semantics, but given how much diet culture has invaded peoples' lives and made it make so many people feel like they can't lose weight, I think they matter here.

The latter is how people lose weight and keep it off. It can't be something you go on and go off.", "Every body is different, but not as different as we like to think, especially not in this context. For the vast majority of people, dieting fails. Some people can do a major cut and then come back to a new maintenance level, but that's rare for that to work long-term, and it certainly isn't going back to the diet before it was done. Maintenance before and after weight loss like that is a big change.
