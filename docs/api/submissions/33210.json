When I meet my \"Daniel\" 29, 4 year's ago, we instantly connected. He asked me out and we were together for 3 years before he asked me to marry him. We do have our ups and downs, and one of the downs is my mil. To give some background, mil adopted my Daniel from her sister, because she can't have babies. So Daniel is her only child. When Daniel first introduced me to mil she was nice enough and I liked her. But even then, now that I think about it, I could sense she didn't like me.\n\n It started with her trying to change me into someone I was not. Told me I would look better with short hair and that Daniel had a thing for women with short hair, which made me raise a brow at that, because my long hair is what my Daniel told me he first noticed and liked about me. This is just one of the many examples she started doing. Everytime I refused she got more unpleasant towards me. Daniel cousins would tell me that she was talking nasty about me behind my back and that she was saying that she hated me and I was no good for her son. She eventually said it to my face in front off her son when we told her we were engaged. There was a big fight and me and Daniel left. He apologized to me and got upset when I told her what she had been doing to me. \n\nIt was during the time we weren't speaking to mil, is when I got curious about Daniel bio mother. I asked questions and he told me about her and that she only lived a town away. When I asked why he never introduced me to her, he said mil and bio mother had a fall out year's ago and they don't speak anymore. I asked would he be okay with me telling her about our engagement? He said he was fine with that. So I rang her and told her and she got excited and asked if it was okay if we could meet? By the end off our meeting I loved her, she's a beautiful soul. I invited her to our wedding and she was thrilled and cried and thanked us. Daniel even started speaking to her the more she came around. \n\nMil found out that I had contacted bio mother. She rang him up crying asking why did we invite her sister he got annoyed and told her it's our wedding and we can invite whoever we want. She screamed at him. He hung up. I know he was hurting. She rang again few days later and he went into another room and returned and put her on loud speaker and she apologized to me for saying what she said. I just shook my head not saying anything because it was just sounded fake and handed the phone back to him. He knew I wasn't accepting her apology and he ended the call. I asked if he was okay and said he's conflicted because she is his mother and he does love her but he feels torn between the two of us. I feel bad now for not accepting her apology.

It is ok not to forgive her.\n\nI agree her apology sounds fake, however at some point you will need to have a relationship with her.\n\nI would tell her, you do not accept her apology, as she has said too many very nasty things about you. But you do need to be cordial with each other for Daniels sake. Set some ground rules with her especially about the things she says about you and should it happen again there will be no contact, ever!\n\nDaniel is currently in the middle of this and probably does not know which way to turn. You probably need a heart to heart with him, he needs to understand his mother cannot keep treating you like this.

She seems like the type who does not approve any females in her sons life and l doubt that will change.\n\nRelationships dont need to be black and white, when it comes to in-laws. It is possible for you not have that woman in your life but for your husband to still continue his relationship with his mother.\n\nI understand that it is crappy being the person between two loved ones who hate eachother. But you cant force relationships. So the only way this will ever work is if he visits his mother without you and lets you have your peace of mind. And like this, he doesn't need to be the mediator.\n\nIt is not the norm, but you can make it work if you want to.", "It might sound fake because she\u2019s not used to apologizing. But she\u2019s making the effort and you should acknowledge that. It\u2019s important to your husband, so give it a shot.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, she sounds pretty horrible and odds are against this being a long term change.

People who blast bile like a dragon breathing fire usually lack the self-control for sustained and successful manipulation.\n\nBut if she is, so what?

Yay either way.", "I know you don't want to hear this, but you should consider pausing your wedding. Your husband needs to sort out his Mummy issues. \n\nI've read so many posts on here from woman who were being treated unkindly by their boyfriends/husbands mother's, who chose not to tell their partner about the comments until the Mum said something in front of him. Always the women had the same fear that their partner wouldn't believe them because they get defensive around their Mum. Always after a period of No Contact or Low Contact, their partner starts feeling bad, contacts their Mum again. And it always get much worse before the partner can see their Mum is toxic. Usually the relationship ends before the partner can accept their Mum raised them in a manipulative way. \n\nYour future husband needs to do some individual counselling and reflecting. He doesn't sound ready for marriage. NTA", ">mil adopted my Daniel from her sister, because she can't have babies.
