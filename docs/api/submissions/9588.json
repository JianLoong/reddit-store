Which she did, then she got to go to culinary classes where she almost failed cause she couldn't crack an egg. She passed anyway \nOur family hosts a dinner every 2 months on the first day of the second month. No excuses, you had to be there. \nEveryone had to bring a side dish, while mom cooked the main meal. \n\nWell a few nights ago, anna and walter came with two things: cornbread and ham. \nSee, if nothing else, anna makes AMAZING cornbread. Its the tastiest the family has ever had. Father made a joke that if nothing else, the cornbread was worth the thousands he put into her schooling. \n\nAnna works at some three star restaurant and it shows, her food is almost the same as something from olive garden or ruby Tuesdays. \nSo she sets the cornbread down and right away i could tell it looked different. But shrugged it off. \nMother was upset about the ham, because she had made a chicken, and the ham had pineapple on it?? So no one really ate it. \n\nWhen it came time for the cornbread however, everyone was in shock at how BAD it was. It was dry and bland, even our brothers (25m 24m) started pretending to gag on it. \nOur mother asked her how could she make the bread so disgusting, since she had done it right so many times. \n\nAnna broke down and said it wasn't HER corn bread, it was BOXED cornbread. Like, the 1.00$ box at whole foods.\n\nWell needless to say everyone got upset and our father asked her what good was her cooking courses if she wasn't going to cook. Anna got real silent and walter snapped that anna had been working a double shift at the restaurant and didn't have time to get all the ingredients.\n\nWell anna broke down in tears. Our parents just started clearing the table and i told her that if she needed ingredients she could have just borrowed some from work. \nWalter snapped at me, calling me and the family ungrateful, and then picked up anna and carried her out to the car. \nMother waited a few days and called, asking for an apology for ruining our nice family dinner but walter told her to screw off and to not contact anna unless WE wanted to apologize. \nWell, anna had already made our parents disappointed with her schooling, so she simply told us that our sister was no longer welcomed into the house until she apologizes and breaks off things with walter. \n\nIts been like, 9 days how can i tell her that she just needs to grow up and apologize for the cornbread?", "created_utc": 1676000399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yf99a/aita_because_my_sister_couldnt_make_cornbread/", "score": 610, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The point of her degree is to work at the restaurant not to keep your family fed with homemade cornbread.\n\nAnd your parents suggested she just steal the ingredients from work if she didn't have time to pick them up?  \n\nAnd Pineapple on ham is pretty common, the pineapple juice makes the ham extra tender.", "YTA.\n\n1.

Which she did, then she got to go to culinary classes where she almost failed cause she couldn't crack an egg. She passed anyway \nOur family hosts a dinner every 2 months on the first day of the second month. No excuses, you had to be there. \nEveryone had to bring a side dish, while mom cooked the main meal. \nWell a few nights ago, anna and walter came with two things: cornbread and ham. \nSee, if nothing else, anna makes AMAZING cornbread. Its the tastiest the family has ever had. Father made a joke that if nothing else, the cornbread was worth the thousands he put into her schooling. \nAnna works at some three star restaurant and it shows, her food is almost the same as something from olive garden or ruby Tuesdays. \nSo she sets the cornbread down and right away i could tell it looked different. But shrugged it off. \nMother was upset about the ham, because she had made a chicken, and the ham had pineapple on it?? So no one really ate it. \nWhen it came time for the cornbread however, everyone was in shock at how BAD it was. It was dry and bland, even our brothers (25m 24m) started pretending to gag on it. \nOur mother asked her how could she make the bread so disgusting, since she had done it right so many times. \nAnna broke down and said it wasn't HER corn bread, it was BOXED cornbread. Like, the 1.00$ box at whole foods.\nWell needless to say everyone got upset and our father asked her what good was her cooking courses if she wasn't going to cook. Anna got real silent and walter snapped that anna had been working a double shift at the restaurant and didn't have time to get all the ingredients.\nWell anna broke down in tears. Our parents just started clearing the table and i told her that if she needed ingredients she could have just borrowed some from work. \nWalter snapped at me, calling me and the family ungrateful, and then picked up anna and carried her out to the car. \nMother waited a few days and called, asking for an apology for ruining our nice family dinner but walter told her to screw off and to not contact anna unless WE wanted to apologize. \nWell, anna had already made our parents disappointed with her schooling, so she simply told us that our sister was no longer welcomed into the house until she apologizes and breaks off things with walter. \nIts been like, 9 days how can i tell her that she just needs to grow up and apologize for the cornbread?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Cleaning the plates?", "It\u2019s all totally made up! Lol", "I got as far as Anna works at a 3 star restaurant and it shows, her food is like something from Olive Garden. WTH? Nothing 3 star about Olive Garden.", "The only thing I can think of is that the \"family profession\" isn't actually psychology, but OP has changed that detail to avoid identification.\n\nThey're probably actually all accountants or engineers.  If they exist, that is.\n\nThe idea that the family described in the OP specialises in the understanding of human psychology is just laughable.", "I'd be giving them jiffy every damn time after that", "Walter sounds like a stand up guy that cares about Anna.

How can a family of people in the mental health industry be totally unable to have any sort of accountability for their emotionally abusive behavior toward their loved one? They should all know that by dismissing Anna\u2019s love of cooking and belittling her choices and abilities they are negatively impacting her self-esteem. One of the basic lessons taught in Psych 101 is that negative familial interactions can impact an individual\u2019s social, emotional, and behavioral skills through their life. Clearly, the lack of support provided from her family unit is causing Anna distress which can lead to anxiety and depression or cutting off her family completely. OP is TA and the whole family should take a hard look at the different ways their behavior has led to this outcome.", "But OP also equates Anna\u2019s ability to making dishes that are as good as any Olive Garden or Ruby Tuesday but yet she works in a 3 star restaurant.  3 star restaurants don\u2019t hire people that cook like someone at Ruby Tuesday.

OP also your family just sucks.", "It's a bit 80s, but yea ham and pineapple is absolutely a thing, and delicious. Hence the pizza", "Right? Like, how have they never seen that? We do it a lot in the south.", "Dont usually eat the pineapple?!? The pineapples are the best part!", "Oh, I read that as a snide comment about it being mediocre.

I am a fine dining chef. Op I never heard such a lack of understanding on food! I am speechless.\n\nAnd a double shift in a restaurant is what it sounds it is. Two whole shifts, back to back without break. \n\nYTA and so is the whole family. To the degree that I hope Anna and Walter \"won't broke down\" and go no contact to live happily ever after.\n\nLike literally, people ARE PAYING YOUR SISTER TO COOK and your father wondered why he had to pay for the courses if she doesn't bring cornbread to a bunch of arrogant people who can't tell the difference between  \"The fat duck\" and \"Ruby Tuesday\".\n\nEdit: And I don't know if your sister can break an egg or not but all the family has no clue about phycology.", "It absolutely terrifies me to think that such out of touch people could be someone's therapist one day", "Thank god someone else picked that up, that's the perfect way to get fired.", "This.

Well said, indeed.", "I noticed that too. I hate ham with pineapple on it, it's not something I saw until I was an adult.
