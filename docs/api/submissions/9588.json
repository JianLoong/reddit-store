Which she did, then she got to go to culinary classes where she almost failed cause she couldn't crack an egg. She passed anyway \nOur family hosts a dinner every 2 months on the first day of the second month. No excuses, you had to be there. \nEveryone had to bring a side dish, while mom cooked the main meal. \n\nWell a few nights ago, anna and walter came with two things: cornbread and ham. \nSee, if nothing else, anna makes AMAZING cornbread. Its the tastiest the family has ever had. Father made a joke that if nothing else, the cornbread was worth the thousands he put into her schooling. \n\nAnna works at some three star restaurant and it shows, her food is almost the same as something from olive garden or ruby Tuesdays. \nSo she sets the cornbread down and right away i could tell it looked different. But shrugged it off. \nMother was upset about the ham, because she had made a chicken, and the ham had pineapple on it?? So no one really ate it. \n\nWhen it came time for the cornbread however, everyone was in shock at how BAD it was. It was dry and bland, even our brothers (25m 24m) started pretending to gag on it. \nOur mother asked her how could she make the bread so disgusting, since she had done it right so many times. \n\nAnna broke down and said it wasn't HER corn bread, it was BOXED cornbread. Like, the 1.00$ box at whole foods.\n\nWell needless to say everyone got upset and our father asked her what good was her cooking courses if she wasn't going to cook. Anna got real silent and walter snapped that anna had been working a double shift at the restaurant and didn't have time to get all the ingredients.\n\nWell anna broke down in tears. Our parents just started clearing the table and i told her that if she needed ingredients she could have just borrowed some from work. \nWalter snapped at me, calling me and the family ungrateful, and then picked up anna and carried her out to the car. \nMother waited a few days and called, asking for an apology for ruining our nice family dinner but walter told her to screw off and to not contact anna unless WE wanted to apologize. \nWell, anna had already made our parents disappointed with her schooling, so she simply told us that our sister was no longer welcomed into the house until she apologizes and breaks off things with walter. \n\nIts been like, 9 days how can i tell her that she just needs to grow up and apologize for the cornbread?", "created_utc": 1676000399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yf99a/aita_because_my_sister_couldnt_make_cornbread/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The point of her degree is to work at the restaurant not to keep your family fed with homemade cornbread.\n\nAnd your parents suggested she just steal the ingredients from work if she didn't have time to pick them up?  \n\nAnd Pineapple on ham is pretty common, the pineapple juice makes the ham extra tender.", "YTA.\n\n1.

Which she did, then she got to go to culinary classes where she almost failed cause she couldn't crack an egg. She passed anyway \nOur family hosts a dinner every 2 months on the first day of the second month. No excuses, you had to be there. \nEveryone had to bring a side dish, while mom cooked the main meal. \nWell a few nights ago, anna and walter came with two things: cornbread and ham. \nSee, if nothing else, anna makes AMAZING cornbread. Its the tastiest the family has ever had. Father made a joke that if nothing else, the cornbread was worth the thousands he put into her schooling. \nAnna works at some three star restaurant and it shows, her food is almost the same as something from olive garden or ruby Tuesdays. \nSo she sets the cornbread down and right away i could tell it looked different. But shrugged it off. \nMother was upset about the ham, because she had made a chicken, and the ham had pineapple on it?? So no one really ate it. \nWhen it came time for the cornbread however, everyone was in shock at how BAD it was. It was dry and bland, even our brothers (25m 24m) started pretending to gag on it. \nOur mother asked her how could she make the bread so disgusting, since she had done it right so many times. \nAnna broke down and said it wasn't HER corn bread, it was BOXED cornbread. Like, the 1.00$ box at whole foods.\nWell needless to say everyone got upset and our father asked her what good was her cooking courses if she wasn't going to cook. Anna got real silent and walter snapped that anna had been working a double shift at the restaurant and didn't have time to get all the ingredients.\nWell anna broke down in tears. Our parents just started clearing the table and i told her that if she needed ingredients she could have just borrowed some from work. \nWalter snapped at me, calling me and the family ungrateful, and then picked up anna and carried her out to the car. \nMother waited a few days and called, asking for an apology for ruining our nice family dinner but walter told her to screw off and to not contact anna unless WE wanted to apologize. \nWell, anna had already made our parents disappointed with her schooling, so she simply told us that our sister was no longer welcomed into the house until she apologizes and breaks off things with walter. \nIts been like, 9 days how can i tell her that she just needs to grow up and apologize for the cornbread?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
