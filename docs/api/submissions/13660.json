She went on to say would i be asking the other bridesmaids or even the groomsmen if they were going to cover up their tattoos. \n\nI said probably not because none of them had a naked woman (nipples and a coochie slit visible.) about the size of their hand. \n\nShe said well then she won\u2019t be a bridesmaid. I said that\u2019s fine and I understand but she won\u2019t be at the wedding period if she doesn\u2019t cover it up. If anyone has anything crude or explicit at the wedding they will be asked to leave. There will be children in attendance and people me and my fianc\u00e9 work with.\n\nWe are getting married in October. By no means will she be in the sweltering heat. The bridesmaids dresses also ensure that it would be mostly covered to an extent but you would still see the bottom half of the very bared naked lady. \n\nShe\u2019s not backing down and I\u2019ve asked the wife, Paige, of a groomswoman to just please be on standby if she can and she can just escort her wife down the aisle.", "created_utc": 1680288410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127v1cl/aita_for_asking_my_bridesmaid_to_cover_up_or_shes/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m pretty sure having that tattoo visible at a wedding is insanely inappropriate, especially if kids will be there", "Nta it's a graphic tattoo and there will be kids at it , plus the attitude problem", "NTA. She\u2019s welcome to the wedding if she covers up her naked lady tat. I love tattoos, I think they\u2019re beautiful art, but, if you have a full on naked woman you have to understand that when children are present this is just not acceptable.

I understand completely where you are coming from. NTA.", "NTA. That doesn't sound like a family friendly tattoo. Most people aren't going to want to have  their kids exposed to that.", "NTA", "Another NTA. I usually am against asking to cover tattoos, as they are a key piece of who someone is, but graphic nudity is an exception.", "NTA for not wanting pornography on display at a wedding hosting children. This wasn't the hill for this woman to choose to die on.", "NTA because the tattoo is literally a naked woman I'd love to see it though", "NTA. tattoo is graphic and there's children in attendance. if it were an adults only event maybe it would be more debatable but otherwise I don't think it's unfair at all to ask that", "NTA", "NTA and congrats on having one of the few AITA posts about asking someone to cover up that doesn't automatically make you TA", "NTA it's an \"offensive\" tattoo and she will be showing it off around children.\n\nLike I get it express yourself, don't make nudity super taboo etc but come on, have some boundaries.", "NTA", "NTA. Can\u2019t she just get some eyeliner and draw some undies on the tat for the night??", "NTA.\n\nNever heard of a woman having a naked chick tattoo though. Very intriguing.", "She could use make up to cover it. \n\nOr paint a tasteful evening dress it. Make her a mermaid?\n\nNTA.\n\nFamily and friends I assume know her and love  her as is. \n\nBut if your bosses will be there, and they are not open people, well it\u2019s not fair, but you get painted  by the same brush.", "NTA. Don\u2019t forget it being visible in wedding photos too. I\u2019m not one for asking something like that, but the design is a fair reason to ask. Got married recently and we didn\u2019t do the bridesmaids/groomsman stuff (I don\u2019t have any friends, and my wife didn\u2019t want the drama mom her end) so I didn\u2019t have to worry about that.", "NTA - tattoos are one thing. Explicit tattoos are something else entirely.\n\nHowever, I would encourage you not to make a scene over it if she decides to show up with the extra boobs hanging out.

Kids will have seen more boobs and vaginas than any kids in the entirety of human history due to the internet.

Think like rockstars on their knees playing guitar", "This is a bad take. The tattoo isn\u2019t natural nudity of a real human. It is a sexualized depiction of a women with her legs spread open. It is not appropriate for children to be exposed to nudity in a sexual context. Seeing your moms boobs when she gets in the shower? Fine. Seeing a naked vagina being sexualized? Not fine.", "Can I ask how?", "It\u2019s on her calf.

Would she be the kind of person to make a scene if she were to come just as a regular guest? I'd change my opinion if you think she'd show up with a new naked tat on her neck or something lol", "That's fair enough, and you seem to be reasonable about it, so I'll just ask: do you focus on this more because you know it's there? Like, would I, not knowing her, see the tattoo only instead of woman? Or would I go: woman. Body. Dress. Some tattoo. Woah now, that's a bit much in tha order? Like, tunnel vision?", "Sounds like an other people problem, though. What's the next step? Your hair doesn't suit my aesthetic beliefs, you have to wear a hat, because I don't want to explain to my kids that, no, they're not getting Dreadlocks?", "Ok... \n\nShe is obviously not shy about it, are you saying that your family hasn't seen it at all?", "Wait wait wait - she hid the tattoo for nearly two years, but thinks your wedding is the place to showcase it? \n\nGood grief", "Just so long as the tattoo has a *very small* naked lady draw on to jt!", "That is genius! LOL!", "Me as well.", "That also amused me. What a fabulous idea.", "Nah. She\u2019s a brat, but she doesn\u2019t do public confrontation and she\u2019s still living off of our parents so if she gets anymore they are cutting her off.", "They have tea length dresses.

In southern USA, maybe someone has an AR-15 tattooed. I'd think they are idiots but who am I to tell them to cover it up. That's what people are like and if you have issues with that become a hermit or something.", "Because she was only doing it to hide it from our parents. She got the tattoo underage. Our parents don\u2019t care about tattoos, I have two but it\u2019s a lot even for them", ">People have paintings on them\n\nIt's not that OP minds tattoos in general; it's the explicit content in particular.", "So it's rather important to her, from what I gather.. to me, people are more important than their looks and I kinda think you feel similarly about that. I will retract the yta but I think if she turns up with the tat, it'll be less buzz than you think now. Without knowing the art, obviously."]}
