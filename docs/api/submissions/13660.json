Why on earth does she expect other people to be ok with this?", "There are times when I REALLY wish Reddit had a \"laugh\" reaction option.", "no, but you can't expect to walk around holding a photo of a nude person everywhere you go, so why would it suddenly be fine if that photo was tattooed onto you?\n\npublic indecency is a thing, others didn't consent to seeing someone naked, which is why you can't just walk around nude, so why should the logic be different when it comes to tattoos at a wedding???", "She should draw a little bridesmaids dress on her.", "You're not very familiar with Christian art are you? Lots of paintings of biblical scenes depict nudity. I live in New Zealand and I am a Christian.", "You're right. Christians notoriously HATE [nude art](https://images.app.goo.gl/apzctgXF8TrQqn8d7)!", "They don\u2019t like explaining themselves. They just like being self righteous.", "Oh cool,! Mine is on my arm lol", "If she'd agree to this, that would be WONDERFUL!!!!", "I love this!!", "Make a little bikini out of bandaids!", "And that would have been so easy to cover, maybe just one more button \ud83d\ude02", "You know, if I had taken a second to see the \"Colo-rectal Surgeon \\[39\\]\" under your username, that would have told me that you didn't need someone to tell you shit you already knew XD", "I really hate when people get some naked/pervy tattoo somewhere where you can't cover it up. I used to know a guy years ago who got a naked nymph with boobies tattooed on himself and I was all, dude, what about jobs? He was all \"I'm an artist and I'm going to move to San Francisco\" about it, which tells you all you need to know there.", "By definition it isn\u2019t.", "Lol my five year old has come home from school very upset before because a boy in her class showed her his underwear. She has discovered her right to privacy and gaurds it jealously. She has a ton of questions about her anatomy and why certain things are supposed to be private. \n \nA five year old would see a tattoo of a naked woman and probably loudly declare to everyone how inappropriate it is. \"MOM I CAN SEE HER NIPPLES AND HER VULVA. THAT'S RUDE.\" is not something I would want to hear at my wedding. \n\nNot to mention, it's highly unlikely the tattoo isn't provocative. A body can absolutely be sexual without being explicit- that's pretty much the definition of provocative. It sounds like it's done in pin up style, not an anatomy study. Judging by the attitude of the tattoo owner, it's likely meant to be provocative and shocking.", "You can't go walking full cock and balls out in public around children for a reason.", "Okay, once you described what the tattoo looks like, I agree you\u2019re NTA.  I will say, though, that I also live in the southern US, and if you don\u2019t think it can be sweltering here in October, you\u2019re mental. :)", "I'm all for tattoos, I have 5 myself. I also believe everyone should do whatever makes them happy. However, if you're going to get a tattoo like that you have to be prepared to have to cover it up sometimes. A setting with children is a prime example. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about tattoos, it\u2019s about decency. This is a professional setting with family and friends where a level of appropriateness is expected.", "She stays at home. End of. Don\u2019t give it anymore thought. She may say she\u2019s going to cover up and then not, don\u2019t risk it if this is important to you.\nNTA", "NTA: Your wedding, your rules.", "NAH. It\u2019s your wedding. Do what you want, but either invite or her don\u2019t. Don\u2019t dictate what she wears as a guest, and if it\u2019s such a big deal pick a bridesmaid dress that covers the whole thing and make them all wear it. I personally get my tattoos because I don\u2019t like the way I look without them, and yes some could be considered offensive to others but I think each one is a piece of art. Your sister is probably the same way.", "NTA.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t have anything about it being a tattoo. But the image.\n  I would have kicked anyone out of my wedding who showed up wearing a shirt like that, whats the difference?", "NTA. I was all set to be up in arms against some prudish anti-tattoo stupid bullshit, but graphic tattoos are different, especially at a classy event. And your sister needs to know that they will need to cover it up or lose the opportunity to participate in many situation.", "Ask her to be a groomsman", "NTA. Totally get why you'd be sensitive especially with children and coworkers in attendance. However and in the spirit of compromise, instead of covering the whole tattoo maybe they can get a temporary tattoo cover or even hand ink to censor the genitalia.", "NTA you tried comprising she wouldn\u2019t take it and the kids that would be there aren\u2019t just family as you said some are kids you nanny for!", "NTA\n\nAnd, as Reddit loves to say ... Your wedding, your rules.  If doesn't like them, stay home.\n\nApparently she's been hiding it from your parents. Even she knows how it will be recieved.  It sounds trashy, to me, but it's not on my body, so not my decision.", "NTA\nIn general I\u2019d say you would be, but given this specific tattoo and the fact that children will be present, it doesn\u2019t seem appropriate.", "NTA\nIn general I\u2019d say you would be, but given this specific tattoo and the fact that children will be present, it doesn\u2019t seem appropriate.", "NTA.  You gave options, it's your wedding.  Standard stuff.", "NTA, when you described the tattoo, I got it. Also its your wedding, so you set the rules.", "She should hire a makeup artist to paint a little bikini on it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you are going to decorate yourself with graphic porn and not cover up, you have to live with the fact that you will not be welcome to many places and occasions", "Shouldn't you normally always have the full context before giving a decision?", "I love this comment. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Temperatures for our specific date range from 49.5-70.7.

Like American traditional is not very detailed and I feel it gets more leeway for being an older style, but a realistic style would be questionable.", "1) She requested to be a bridesmaid. 2) I offered for her to wear a suit one of the grooms women are wearing. \n\nHaving a tattoo of a woman\u2019s legs spread topless isn\u2019t body shaming, but okay \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Probably 3-11 because she nanny\u2019s them these are kids of the parents she nanny\u2019s for", "I didn\u2019t think about it until lady. She could just blur it out. But the tattoo is basically a naked woman in a rockstar on their knees, leg spread pose.", "She can wear a suit, a long dress or a suit of armor. I don\u2019t care. I just don\u2019t want my 5-10 year old nanny kids to see it.", "Yeah I'd think with a tattoo like that you'd make sure to have things ready to censor it if necessary. Like bandaids, or some people are really good at covering tattoos with concealer.", "Lmao how old is she?", "I mean, I agree. Also, what is the placement? Is it on her back? Face?", "So, if it doesn't reflect on you, then why are you policing it?\n\nLke this person said, I think you crossed to AH territory by banning her from the wedding altogether, not just the bridal party...", "Whatever, like I said, just rip the bandaid off and tell her not to come.  Stop beating around the bush, no pun intended.\n\nSpeaking of which, we all literally come into this world from a pair of spread legs.  It's the first thing you see before you take your first breath.  Nobody cares about this until you teach them to care about it is my point.", "if it's on her calf, can't you just get her a longer dress that fits the colour scheme?", "Can\u2019t really be sure because like half of the kids in middle-highschool that i knew had a babysitter/nanny. Don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just a Christian thing or if it\u2019s universal", "All I\u2019m saying is you\u2019re not being an asshole here but you are in the wrong trying to dictate how someone presents themself. Your sister likely views it as art, where you view it as pornographic in nature which is your right to do. It\u2019s not your body or your choice, however it is your choice to invite or not invite and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to come down to.", "I was thinking that using bandaids as censor bars might be funny too.", "I don\u2019t get it either, but the tattoo artist who did my dog\u2019s memorial tattoo does a LOT of tattoos of naked women pleasuring themselves, performing oral, etc.  Not my cup of tea, and didn\u2019t stop me getting work by him, because his style is freaking amazing, but \u2026 his NSFW stuff is really popular.  To each their own, I guess.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "19. She\u2019ll be 20 in august. She got it while she was underage so the work on it looks terrible to be honest. Like you can tell it\u2019s a naked woman but one nipple is definitely misshapen and the woman\u2019s face has lopsided eyes", "According to OP it's on her calf.", "I\u2019m policing it because I know the parents who will have children in attendance don\u2019t expose their children to lewd images of women.\n\nThese are families I actively work for as a nanny. It has nothing to do with how it reflects me but this isnt the environment to have a frankly soft core pornographic tattoo on display", "But if I am being TA tell me why.

Some of them are dumber than shit, but they're cute and tasteful. My derpy wizard cat is a huge crowd pleaser.", "Ack, who will notice?", "Without seeing the tattoo, hard to be sure of judgment...\n\nBut I saw your comment that its a calf tattoo... I initially imagined it was like on her arm or back; ie somewhere really visible at eye level...\n\nSo more than before, I think you're the AH for banning her altogether...\n\nBut hey, it's your wedding... congrats!

Did you get that tattoo to play the perpetual victim? Was that the goal, or are you just that clueless? \n\nMost people don\u2019t want to see tits and puss grocery shopping or at work.
