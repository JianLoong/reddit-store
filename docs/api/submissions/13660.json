At a wedding last summer, my friend asked why the bride didn't ask me to cover up all of my tattoos but had asked *her* to cover up *her* tattoo. Her tattoo was a giant vagina.

Is Michaelangelos David pornography?\n\nAnd let's not pretend that there is extra pearl clutching because it's on a woman not a man.", "??? Right well if you want nude men and women around your kids or at your wedding that's you. Most people do not want that, whether it's a tat, or being themselves or even images etc. Nobody here brought up gender but you - yes women are way more sexualised but in this scenario a naked man would illicit the same damn response. \n\nPerfectly reasonable to find it inappropriate, explicit and sexual, even if it isn't two people having sex. Can't believe you think that's the only criteria.\n\nWillingly ignoring context and what people really mean is just grating.\n\nAlso I said sexual or AT LEAST explicit.", "A 5 year old won\u2019t but a 13 year old would probably. I agree with you that a naked body is beautiful and can be complete art without anything sexual about it. But there is a time and place for these things.
