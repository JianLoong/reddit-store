She has a bunch of potted flowers, succulents, and cacti on the balcony and in the backyard. She's very attached to them and calls them her 'babies.'\n\nI'm not a big fan of plants, but I promised her that I would water them every day. However, I got distracted with work and other things and completely forgot about the plants. When she returned yesterday, she was horrified to see that some of them were wilted, dried out, or dead.\n\nShe got furious with me and accused me of being irresponsible, careless, and insensitive. She said I don't respect her hobby and that I don't care about her feelings. She said the plants were important to her, and I should have been more attentive.\n\nI apologized and tried to explain that it was an honest mistake, but she didn't want to listen. She's been giving me the silent treatment since then and refuses to speak to me. She said she'll continue to do so until I make things right.\n\nI think she's overreacting and being dramatic. The plants are cheap and easily replaceable. She can buy others just like them or even better ones at the gardening store. I don't understand why she's so upset over something so trivial.\n\nI know I messed up by forgetting to water the plants, but I didn't do it on purpose. They're just plants, not people.

She has a bunch of potted flowers, succulents, and cacti on the balcony and in the backyard. She's very attached to them and calls them her 'babies.'\n\nI'm not a big fan of plants, but I promised her that I would water them every day. However, I got distracted with work and other things and completely forgot about the plants. When she returned yesterday, she was horrified to see that some of them were wilted, dried out, or dead.\n\nShe got furious with me and accused me of being irresponsible, careless, and insensitive. She said I don't respect her hobby and that I don't care about her feelings. She said the plants were important to her, and I should have been more attentive.\n\nI apologized and tried to explain that it was an honest mistake, but she didn't want to listen. She's been giving me the silent treatment since then and refuses to speak to me. She said she'll continue to do so until I make things right.\n\nI think she's overreacting and being dramatic. The plants are cheap and easily replaceable. She can buy others just like them or even better ones at the gardening store. I don't understand why she's so upset over something so trivial.\n\nI know I messed up by forgetting to water the plants, but I didn't do it on purpose. They're just plants, not people.

Mine unfortunately died when it got dropped and the pot she had custom made for me broke and someone stepped on it. Her\u2019s is still thriving. My dad complains about taking care of it all the time but he never stops watering it and checking it every day to make sure it\u2019s thriving. Mom died in 2019 so that cactus is really special to both of us. I may not have the sibling to it anymore but we still have hers that she nurtured and cared for and it\u2019s really branched and gotten so big for a little window cactus.

He has pretty severe ADHD but hates the meds because they make him feel like a zombie and I\u2019ll never try and make him take them. However, when my mom died and I was in a really bad place, he meticulously watched over my aloe and cacti that I had sitting in my dorm window and would move them around if he thought they were looking a little dry and crispy from the direct sunlight coming through the window and would water them just slightly with a spray bottle every two or so days to keep them from shriveling. He handled both his class schedule and mine and made up a rotating schedule for our friends so I\u2019d never be alone after he caught me trying to OD a week after my mom\u2019s funeral. He did so much for me when all I wanted to do was die and I\u2019ll never be able to thank him enough. \n\nIf they love you, they\u2019ll make the effort without you ever having to say a word. \n\nOP, YTA, massively.", "Liars are *so* exhausting aren't they?", "Nah let's not blame video games for someone being careless.", "Starfield came out this month.", "Amen.
