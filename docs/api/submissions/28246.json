She has a bunch of potted flowers, succulents, and cacti on the balcony and in the backyard. She's very attached to them and calls them her 'babies.'\n\nI'm not a big fan of plants, but I promised her that I would water them every day. However, I got distracted with work and other things and completely forgot about the plants. When she returned yesterday, she was horrified to see that some of them were wilted, dried out, or dead.\n\nShe got furious with me and accused me of being irresponsible, careless, and insensitive. She said I don't respect her hobby and that I don't care about her feelings. She said the plants were important to her, and I should have been more attentive.\n\nI apologized and tried to explain that it was an honest mistake, but she didn't want to listen. She's been giving me the silent treatment since then and refuses to speak to me. She said she'll continue to do so until I make things right.\n\nI think she's overreacting and being dramatic. The plants are cheap and easily replaceable. She can buy others just like them or even better ones at the gardening store. I don't understand why she's so upset over something so trivial.\n\nI know I messed up by forgetting to water the plants, but I didn't do it on purpose. They're just plants, not people.

She has a bunch of potted flowers, succulents, and cacti on the balcony and in the backyard. She's very attached to them and calls them her 'babies.'\n\nI'm not a big fan of plants, but I promised her that I would water them every day. However, I got distracted with work and other things and completely forgot about the plants. When she returned yesterday, she was horrified to see that some of them were wilted, dried out, or dead.\n\nShe got furious with me and accused me of being irresponsible, careless, and insensitive. She said I don't respect her hobby and that I don't care about her feelings. She said the plants were important to her, and I should have been more attentive.\n\nI apologized and tried to explain that it was an honest mistake, but she didn't want to listen. She's been giving me the silent treatment since then and refuses to speak to me. She said she'll continue to do so until I make things right.\n\nI think she's overreacting and being dramatic. The plants are cheap and easily replaceable. She can buy others just like them or even better ones at the gardening store. I don't understand why she's so upset over something so trivial.\n\nI know I messed up by forgetting to water the plants, but I didn't do it on purpose. They're just plants, not people.

You did not skip a day or two, but TWO WHOLE WEEKS!!\n\nInstead you\u2019re being a small gaslighter, belittling her hobby and searching validation from Internet strangers by calling her dramatic. I\u2019d be absolutely devastated if something important to me got ruined because of my partner\u2019s lack of understanding and responsibility.\n\nYTA\n\nOffer sincere apologies and try replace her loss if it\u2019s that easy, as it is your doing.", "This must be fake, because nobody could be so stupid as to ignore/forget such a simple task for 14 days in a row *and* remain oblivious to how upsetting it would be for his wife. Dumb post by a dumbass.", "I wonder how old OP and his wife are because OP at least sounds like a particularly self-absorbed teenager.", "Sounds like a spouse from the gardening store would know exactly how to take care of her\u2026plants \ud83d\udc40", "i believe this dude isnt helping out at home at all.", "I mean, it's pretty clear he didn't think about those plants once, I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility he has no idea what kind of plants she has, or what instructions she gave.", "To add to this, many people who have lots of plants have some that were given to them by people they care about, like a cutting of a hoya from your mum's plant, or the lily bulbs I have from my great grandfather's garden. Just because they're not an expensive variety doesn't mean they're low-value.", "Exactly, it's not about the plants. What really makes him the AH to me in this case is his lack of remorse. Sure he apologized but his attitude suggests that he doesn't think it's that big of a deal and doesn't actually feel bad. I bet the wife is picking up on that too.\n\nETA: OP, don't get a dog.", "Exactly, you don\u2019t need to water cacti for 2 damn months.  Op is taking shit.", "This is so true. And if this post is real, I strongly suggest OP read the article\u2018My Wife Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes by the Sink\u2019 by Matthew Fray https://matthewfray.com/2016/01/14/she-divorced-me-because-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink/", "The calling her dramatic and the situation trivial is just about the worst part of this - OP, like all assholes, is allergic to taking the slightest responsibility for his own actions, or lack thereof.\n\nI bet that AH never even truly apologized, just made excuses for why she was wrong to expect him to give a shit about anything but his own interests.\n\nYTA OP.", "For two weeks! It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t do it for one day or something. He killed them and is acting like it\u2019s no big deal", "Bigtime Ahole.  Imagine leaving this guy your cat or dog", ">completely forgot\n\nLike, dude, put a reminder in your phone. It's not hard. YTA.", "He's got a bad case of the missing missing reasons.\n\nWife: I'm upset and here's why.  Husband: I have no idea why she's mad. It's a complete mystery. Science may never know the truth.", "You can't expect to remember something like that if you don't make a conscious effort to do it. Maybe try making yourself a reminder or putting a Post-It note near the plants to remind you to water them? It could help you get into a routine.", "Oh, she\u2019ll leave.", "Also, didn\u2019t they talk while she was away? I\u2019m not blaming her at all, but I find it highly unlikely that she didn\u2019t send him reminder texts. It seems almost impossible that he completely forgot the one thing he had to do while she was away. What does seem possible is that he remembered late at night while he was in bed and just didn\u2019t do it and then that continued to happen the whole time.", "Even that doesn\u2019t work as an excuse. I play video games every day and still manage to keep a garden alive.", "Please forgive yourself. Your mom's plan of not asking, not providing instructions to people who don't regularly care for plants, and then expecting it would get done was doomed to fail.", "This is where my mind immediately went. I would be reconsidering ever reproducing with this negligent dodo.", "Apologies generally consist of taking accountability for your actions and making amends. Dude here did neither.\n\nThis idiot is dodging any accountability (she\u2019s overreacting/being dramatic, the plants are replaceable) AND he won\u2019t even go through the effort of replacing the plants himself.", "Oh yes they can especially if the weather is warm", "The succulents, sure, but there are absolutely other plants that will die in that time as I have unfortunately been the killer lol I\u2019ve seen it", "I have plants that would be dead in two *days* without water.", "There was probably a video game release.", "Happy cake day!", "Happy cake day!", "I agree 100%.  I have a jade plant that I started from a leaf 15 years ago.  I have a Pothos that is 26 years old.\n\nI have 15 Amaryllis plants that I started from seed.\n\nSure I can replace all the above with new plants, but they will not be the same plants.", "Not to mention all the time and effort she's put into her garden! At minimum months, but it could have been years that she's been cultivating these plants, and all that work went down the tube and husband is just like \"whatever, you can just buy more\". I'd be pissed too!", "Honestly, if he watered succulents and cacti every day, they\u2019d probably be pretty sick (maybe not dead).", "Every smartphone has the ability to set alarms or reminders.\n\nOP is TA", "That's kind of the point, he didn't make a conscious effort to remember even though the plants are important to her.", "Uh, yeah, that's why he's the TAH. He didn't do ANYTHING to remind himself to do the thing he said he would.\n\nHe isn't even smart enough to make a fucking post it note.\n\nHe doesn't even love her post it note amount.", "But here's a thing: If I would ask my partner to water my plants, he wouldn't just do it, but most likely he would send me funny pictures of him doing it or pictures of the plants with texts like \"we miss you\". So it's not just about the plants, she just realized (or this was the final straw) that her boyfriend doesn't really care about her that much.", "I am not a plant person. In fact I suspect I am the opposite of a green thumb. I'm pretty sure I'm a blackhole that can take the life force of plants I try to grow. I can tell you now I can speed run accidentally killing a plant down to a week while honestly trying to keep it alive.", "My friend group is still big on Baldur's Gate 3 and the Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk came out then too. Both pretty damn solid and fun.", "They did just shut down the ARK servers forever last week. Everyone I knew that played were getting on to say good bye etc."]}
