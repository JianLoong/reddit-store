You know it's not yours so, it's stealing but no clue if it is from a legal standpoint. At the same time you plan to return it. So, that puts you in the clear either way.

However, big picture is, you know it would be stealing in some form even if it's not legally stealing..., Which I think you weren't going to do either way..you just wanted to. Which is fair. I want you to have it too... And I want you to be mad at your mom because I am.

So I don't even understand the legal aspect of that. How can it be proven that it wasn't meant for you? I'm inclined to believe that you would be in the clear in this scenario. \n\nRegardless, do NOT give your mom any money. She's been treating you like garbage for too long.

I'm doing this anyway because the cost of not doing so is too high for me now   \n\nadding in your emotional experience in this (honestly) may help as well. even if those emotions include things you'd like to not acknowledge\n\nyou're in a horrible position and I wish you the best of luck navigating it\n\nETA - if you're struggling with going no contact, one thing that can help is writing down all the costs of staying and the costs of leaving   \n\nthose things can be practical and emotional. they can financial, they can be physical. never getting to see your childhood home again. never getting to have relationships with certain family members. maybe you'd lose insurance. maybe the family that is abusive to you also does provide a certain amount of support. if you got sick would they be there for you? do you have a medical history for your family? this list can include potential futures. like not having a mother to walk you down the aisle at a wedding, or never being able to introduce a future child to grandparents from your side. your future children not having an aunt. missing the funerals of your parents. this list can include things that will never come to pass. like having a mother who was truly your mother. often children going NC with abusive family our house mourning the reality of what they lost and half morning the relationships that they never had and were never going to get to have\n\ntake the time to write down everything. and make sure to write down all of the costs of keeping the relationship as well. monetary costs, stress costs, self love costs, self respect, etc. not having a mother to walk you down the aisle is half of the story, but not having a mother to ruin your wedding and make your entire wedding about her is the other half. most of your losses will also be gains. it's messy, complex\n\nif and when you do decide to go no contact, doing something like this can help you mentally and physically prepare. it also gives you the opportunity to mourn each of the things you'll be losing and create the space for a goodbye. maybe the next time you go home you know that it's your last time being in that home and you take the time to mourn it or do some ritual to say goodbye. maybe you prepare physically by taking items, or pictures. maybe before you take the step of blocking family on social media you go through their Facebooks and download all the photos that you want or might one day want\n\ngoing no contact does not have to be sudden or abrupt. it can be intentionally planned and cultivated and that planning can give you the space to say goodbye and to mourn in the present", "If your mom won't give your sister anything even slightly used, that is your mom's problem.
