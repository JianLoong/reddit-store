She's learning a basic rule of business: \"dress for the job you want\". People can complain about 'superficiality' when potential customers/bosses judge them on how they choose to present themselves, but...what the hell are they supposed to do? Drop everything and stalk you to find out if the impression you gave off is accurate?\n\nIf you want to be taken seriously as a professional you'll have to consider how your target audience thinks - and if they think you look sloppy, it's your job to present yourself in a way that speaks to them. It's not their job to be sold to - it's your (partner's) job to sell.", "NTA If bro can't *design* a good looking outfit, no one is gonna want him to *design* anything for them. It's facts.   \n\n\nYou can dress comfy when you're at home, but if you're meeting with people, you need to look the part. Dress for the job you want, not the job you have.", "NTA - It\u2019s like going to a hairdresser and they have hair that\u2019s in bad condition or is a style that looks bad on them, in certain industries where you are trading on your skills around style and aesthetics, how you look and act really reflect your abilities in this area.\n\nIt\u2019s also perfectly possible to have an alternative or eclectic look without looking mismatched or like you put on the only clothes that weren\u2019t in the wash that day. The fact that the designer can\u2019t evolve their own style into something that\u2019s going to suit them whilst also looking a bit more polished and profession, is an issue, because she needs to understand what clients want, not what she likes and she\u2019s falling at that first hurdle.", "INFO: How on Earth did it come up that these orgs you pitched to disapproved of your partner's clothes? \"We would have gone with you but your partner's sneaks are atrocious.\" Is that a sentence that has ever been said? Either you're forcing this issue to be brought up with your clients in an unprofessional manner, or youre imagining confirmation of your biases, or you're making this up. Either way YTA.", "NTA. i dont care how good you are if you dont respect me enough to attempt to dress up for a meeting. it doesnt have to be expensive clothes (i bought my dress clothes at a good will on the nice side of town). the effort is what i appreciate.", "dressing professionally is just what the real world entails when you need to do it in order to seem presentable so people will engage. NTA. appearance is important and idk why people try to deny that lol.", "I\u2019m an interior designer (with a degree) and the best designers I know dress like utter shit unless we\u2019re at an industry event. \n\nI wore crocs to a client\u2019s house today and no one gave one shit.", "If she's the designer and you're just the front man then it's probably her way or the highway, right? The business wouldn't exist without her skills but men in suits who took an SAT prep class or two are a dime a dozen.", "NTA\n\nHow about suggesting you do an experiment? Do a couple of clients meetups/presentations with her wearing her normal attire and some wearing something more fitting for the situation and see if there's a difference in success rate.\nIf indeed it seems her normal style is costing you business she could keep a change of outfit at work so she feels comfortable in her regular work tasks. This is normal in IT and some engineering jobs.", "sounds like ur the business side of things here so I\u2019m gonna say YTA for not seeing the simple solution of keeping the designer seperate from sales presentations and pitches. Go have your meetings in a suit and whatever, relay the project expectations back to ur designer and present them (alone)when ready.", "NAH.  The two of you have different fashion sense.  While some student groups may have been turned off by her dress, your more polished appearance may turn others off. What you see as feedback, she sees as judgmental criticism.  Either the two of you should see a third-party mentor who works with entrepreneurial start-ups or you should split now and go your separate ways.", "NTA, but you are not entirely right either. Personal presentation in business is a bit of a game, some people care, some don\u2019t, and you can choose to use that to your advantage or not. Your partner needs to realise this and possibly make some more strategic choices when meeting (or not meeting) potential clients, the rest of the time it shouldn\u2019t matter how they present themselves. Once you are established and have a reputation that speaks for itself it won\u2019t make much of a difference anymore.", "ESH -- you for asking your partner to dress up when interacting with college clubs, and her for completely blowing you off.\n\nExpecting a better mode of dress would make sense if you're presenting to professional organizations, but let's face it... that doesn't describe most college clubs.", "NTA.  Dress for the job.", "YTA! The more i read you answers here, that more you proof that you are a major AH. You are either only giving half the information to us or are lying so that you get nta votes.", "YTA. Let them dress how they want and feel comfortable. Dressing in basic clothes hasn't caused any issues for Mark Zuckerberg.", "YTA. She's your partner not your employee. You don't get to dictate her appearance. And many graphic designers I know (I've hired several for various projects) dress exactly like your partner. Maybe they channel their aesthetic sense into their art instead of their outfit? Either way, it sounds like she needs to find a business partner more compatible with her, and you need to go work at a bank.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m not sure why that gap exists between our two experiences, but it empirically does exist.", "Plenty of people would care. I certainly would. I run a successful business and part of the reason why is looking and acting professional.", "I promise you that people do give a shit but most of the time people are too nice to say something", "I used to think this way, but it\u2019s actually the other way around. You can find people with technical ability all day long, but extremely few of those people have any business sense at all. It is a simple thing to dress professionally while sticking to a personalized style. It\u2019s also one of the few things you can easily control. A lot of my success as a business owner has been related to knowing how to differentiate with simple things like that.

My issue isn\u2019t so much her level of formality, more so that she\u2019s showcasing a lack of fashion.", "Dressing professionally is not a turn off. This is bad advice.", "To clarify, most of these clubs are professional business/engineering/etc organizations that generally are selective, have dress codes, participate in competitions in their respective field, and such. So dressing up wouldn\u2019t be completely out of the ordinary.", "How so? All OP has done is clarify that it isn\u2019t a matter of formal vs casual wear, it\u2019s just that their partner has that \u201curban\u201d Gen Z street wear style and honestly? I wouldn\u2019t hire a person in crocs to design a pamphlet.", "There\u2019s a difference between \u2018basic\u2019 and looking not put together.

I don\u2019t think the issue is even the fact that she dresses casual it\u2019s the fact that while presenting you guys don\u2019t look like a unified unit which to me would be more off putting than if you both were in very casual clothes", "  Well then.

It\u2019s possible to look like you know what you\u2019re doing and like you got dressed in the dark, both with formal wear and casual clothes.

But I digress.", "In the OP, I\u2019ve simply stated what she wears, not their fit, condition, etc. Hence neither stating that she\u2019s sloppy or that she\u2019s *not* sloppy. Why are you assuming that she\u2019s not sloppy? \n\nAnd given that as I said in the OP multiple people have stated her sense of dress have diminished their opinion of her and I\u2019s design skills, clearly there is something wrong with that.", "Yes and that comes down to taste. And lucky for the world, everybody has a different taste. Imagine what a boring place this would be if everybody would like the same things.", "We can only go by your post, which has no mention at all of fit, wear or sloppiness. Why would I instantly assume that she looks like she has just emerged from a swamp when there is no evidence of that? I am simply going by your description, and that is cargo pants, graphic tees and shoes.\n\nHer outfit sounds very similar to what I wear on Frisay to the office, or when working from home. I am a IT manager for a big company, and have meetings like this daily. No issue.\n\nWe also interview numerous companies for big projects. Guess what isn't on our selection criteria? Yep, what clothes they are wearing. In fact, if they turn up in Amani suits we simply know we are getting taken for a ride. We often end up going with those who are dressed more casual as they typically have the better offer on the table and tend to know more than the suits.", "Yes and no. Each person has individual taste, yes, but more often than not people\u2019s tastes align pretty closely. Hence common beauty standards and people considered attractive.", "Lengthy monologue aside, your personal experiences with standards of dress aren\u2019t very relevant to a entirely different industry and entirely different context, especially when empirically people have expressed a problem with how she dresses", "So crocs or Armani suits are the only options? Business casual is what professional people wear.", "You\u2019re right on this one. Let it be.", "So everyone else is wrong.
