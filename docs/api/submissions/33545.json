People with relevant technical ability are literally the service and value being exchanged. \n\nClients usually just want the job done well in my experience and it's not the \"simple things\" that get the job done well.\n\nBusiness sense is important but it's simple things as you said. It's easy to train people to wear a uniform, communicate politely and to weigh returns appropriately. \n\nIt's why Sam Altman is still calling the shots over at openAI, because the actual value of the company threatened to leave when the business side wanted to get rid of him.\n\nThe business side is literally nothing without the service it's selling.\n\nEdit: this is also why strikes work...", "Multiple people were like \"the art is great but I could never work with someone wearing such an ugly shirt?\"", "They really don\u2019t but sure, if you say so \u2026", "Never seen \"no crocs\" on an RFP.", "Guess we\u2019re that good. Their neighbors are about to sign a contact \u2026 crocs and all \ud83d\ude2c", "I've never known my crocks to impede my ability to draw, but hey what do I know. Personally I'd let their work not their shoes do the deciding for me.", "It's possible that they can't use your services anyway. Can student organizations at your school really use design materials from randoms? At mine, you have to go through the school's marketing department if you're not just doing it yourself.", "This is not true at all. lmao.", "It very well could be the case. It could also be simply us being in a different section of the design industry than the person above is. Either way, there\u2019s a chance that dressing better will help us get more clients, so I don\u2019t see why not to take it. Even if the attempt fails, she loses nothing", "Right, this dude is full of shit", "Yes, it\u2019s a design agency so obviously people would expect you to have a good sense of taste", "It\u2019s my problem too when we\u2019re not getting any clients", "It\u2019s not their ability to draw; it\u2019s the way you present yourself (especially if you\u2019re selling your \u201cstyle\u201d).\n\nPeep the likes, dude.", "Actually when I was studying advertising we were told the people managing the business had to dress well, but creatives could get away with whatever clothes because they are allowed to be eccentric.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in a position to tell me what organizations at my college, that I\u2019m a member of, have as a dress code", "oh whoops my bad", "I\u2019m also a woman, and so are the leader of a lot of these organizations who I am friends/connected with and pitched to. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.", "Well yea, I was replying about a different case.", "Problem is this company is so small that she's actually serving both roles. So the rule doesn't really apply to her at this point. When she meets potential customers, she is serving as the face of the business, not the creative talent.", "I work in advertising. Can confirm. Young acount folks dress businessy. The rest of us (media, creative, production etc) look like whatever we want.", "That would be the case if she didn\u2019t insist on going to presentations too. If she worked behind the scenes I wouldn\u2019t have a problem however she dressed", "Ehhh I\u2019d say  they can get away with styled eccentric clothes, but it\u2019s still got to be a look even if it\u2019s not formal", "Fair enough", "Your bad-faith argument implied the existence of two options. You the based the rest of your comment on that assumption."]}
