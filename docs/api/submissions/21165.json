This has always been an issue but as of lately since he moved out it\u2019s skyrocketed. During the wedding I noticed he was eating an abnormal amount of food. First he went to an all you can eat candy table and filled his plate to the top with candy. Then he ended up going back and forth from the candy table to the buffet. \nI noticed he went back and forth at least 3 times with full plates. I decided to walk over to him and say something because it was out of control. I went over to him and warned him that he\u2019s over eating and that he might get sick again like he has in the past. He got mad at me for bring up his past and told me to mind my business. I decided to ignore him and go to the dance floor. \n\nA half hour later I see him briskly walking over to me with a horrified look on his face. He pulled me aside and right away I noticed something was wrong and he smelled. He told me to follow him to the bathroom and I realized as we were walking there that he was holding his ass walking weird and smelling like shit. I immediately scolded him and flat out asked if he shit his pants. He said wait until we get in the bathroom but I snapped and started saying what the hell is wrong with you. \n\nOnce we got to the bathroom he told me to block the door and I said no other people need to use this. He said he has to clean his pants and if I can\u2019t block the door while he does it then to get someone else to help him. At the point I was so mad I said fuck no I\u2019ll just mind my own business then and went to walk out. As I was walking out, our grandpa walked in and saw him taking off his pants to run it under the sink. Our grandpa just looked at us both and walked out. I walked out too  because I was so embarrassed to be associated with this. \n\nSomehow it spread and I heard people whispering about it and some even laughing. He ended up leaving and not going to the family brunch today. I never wanted to be involved in this and I tried to warn him, I\u2019m upset because he\u2019s not answering my texts and just want this to be forgotten.", "created_utc": 1688322126, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ov946/aita_for_not_helping_my_little_brother_out_when/", "score": 349, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He refused to listen to your warning. Having an incredibly embarrassing moment may be his rock bottom to realize he needs some help. You didn\u2019t announce it over the DJ microphone, it sounds like grandpa may have let it slip which that\u2019s on him.", "NTA. That's disgusting. He 19, not a freaking toddler. This is on him and you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. You weren't kind, but not an asshole. You tried to tell him not to eat so much. You've tried to tell your parents there is a problem. They chose not to listen. You didn't have it in you at that moment to deal with the actual shit.\n\nHopefully this will be dealt with now.  After this the problem is out in the open. Give your brother a time to get over the embarrassment.", "Are you sure he doesn't have an undiagnosed medical condition? If he's eating that much, he should start to feel sick before it gets to that point. If he feels the need to keep eating, he may be lacking something in his diet.\n\nI used to get awful stomach aches and bouts of nausea, even when eating very little. It turned out I wasn't getting enough protein. Your brother needs to see a doctor, maybe a GI specialist.\n\nINFO: Is your brother on the skinnier side, or is he bigger? Being underweight and eating that much and having GI issues is a major red flag, and a sign he needs a doctor.\n\nETA: People have mentioned brother is overweight. He should still see a specialist to see if he has IBS or another digestive disease, because this is not normal for overeating. Others have said the candy may have been sugar free which is usually like a laxative- OP, can you reach out to your family and check what kind of candy was served?", "NTA though it does sound like your brother needs medical attention. 19 year olds don't just poop themselves, especially not with toilets readily available", "Why didnt you go tell your parents? He's their kid, he had a problem they could have helped him ?  He's got an eating disorder - and yes you warned him and yes he bought it on himself but people with mental health disorders can't help it. So instead of just walking away - you should have warned your parents he was over-eating and when he did have a problem you should have told them to go sort it out and get him cleaned up. Its their kid even if he is an adult now. \n\n Someone has to get him the right intervention. His parents failed him if this is long standing issue that he faced when he was under 18 and in their home and not just when he moved out.", "Eating disorder alert!!!", "NTA - Wow. That\u2019s tough.", "Info: was this plate of candy the \"sugar-free\" kind?

YOU want it to be forgotten?--don't you think he does too?  It's much more embarrassing to him.\n\nYou didn't owe him to help him, esp. after warning him, BUT don't expect that he's going to be happy about your refusal or be ready to forgive you for not doing so.", "NTA, He got mad at you for trying to help earlier and then went to you for help? People saying \u2018he\u2019s your brother and you betrayed his trust\u2019 you never agreed to help him so how could you betray his trust? Anyway at 19 he isn\u2019t a kid anymore he needs some help but if he\u2019s not willing to seek it and your parent are in denial this isn\u2019t your issue!", "NTA, you tried to help him by heading it off. He told you to back off. You weren't kind, but you weren't cruel. Further He and your parents refuse to seek help for it. He shat his pants and he can sit in it. Maybe this will be a wake up call.", "NAH. It's a difficult situation. It really looks like your brother might have an eating disorder (it's possible there were laxatives involved here, not just overeating). So I'm reluctant to call him an AH.\n\nIn the moment, walking out was okay - he was sick but is also an adult and you warned him. It was just bad timing that grandpa saw it. That part was not intentional, and I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that YOU wouldn't have gone and talked about the incident with other guests", "NTA\n\nHe's a big boy. Actions have consequences.", "Your brother needs 1. an intervention about his eating. 2. a therapist who works with overeaters. 3. a doctor who will see past the fat because that he soiled himself isn't normal.\n\nI'm not a therapist but I may have some insight as to why. Weddings are stressful, cause, you know, family. With this incident, it's not going to be easier for him. He may also be thinking that he's going to be alone forever, cause weddings do that. So he was comfort binge eating. That voice in your head that says stop, your full, a lot of larger people don't have that anymore.\n\nSo, you should visit your brother. Make sure he's okay mentally. Let him talk and listen without judgement.\n\nI'm not giving you a judgement.", "Nta", "NTA but you could have blocked the door\u2026not your responsibility and you\u2019ve discussed it w him.

Please talk to your parents, they need to attempt to intervene asap.", "Any chance he's abusing laxatives as part of his ED? If so, he needs specialized help.", "NTA live your life let him deal with it", "YTA. That's your brother. He didn't deserve it, but that's your brother.

If what you say about his overeating being an issue, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s suffering from an eating disorder. it\u2019s very normal for people, especially 19 yos, to get upset and defensive when told about their eating habits.\n\nwhat your brother needs is help and some empathy, and you couldn\u2019t find it in you to give either of it to him. even when he was in a troublesome situation and trusted you to help.", "YTA. I totally understand how this situation could be irritating for you, but it sounds like your brother is dealing with a severe undiagnosed eating disorder and he doesn\u2019t know how to come to terms with it. The best thing you can do for him, besides suggesting that he go to therapy or talk to his family about this, is to be there for him in embarrassing moments like this. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a massive asshole because sibling dynamics can be annoying and it can be hard to deal with repetitive unhealthy behavior, but what your brother needs above all else is support right now.", "NTA. \n\nIts her wedding. Hes an adult.\r  \n\r  \nNot her responsibility to literally clean up his mess on one of the most important days in HER life.", "YTA. Whatever your brother\u2019s medical or mental health issues, he asked you for help and you abandoned him.

He's got a eating disorder as someone else said and needs help, professional help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's your brother and he trusts you but you've betrayed that trust.

People aren\u2019t perfect (ie can be assholes) sometimes, and you just fucking bailed on him. \n\nIf my family bailed on me in my depths of alcoholism I might not be here right now. \n\nI was certainly an asshole to them at my worst, but they didn\u2019t fucking bail on me. \n\nBe better.", "YTA, he clearly has BED or a similar issue, was mortified, and you refused to even make sure nobody saw him for a few minutes while he cleaned himself up.", "YTA.\n\nHe probably has some sort of mental health problems or eating disorder. It's not like he pooped himself on purpose either. You are his brother, and you should have helped him. Instead you were mean to him and did nothing to help him.

So is OP.\n\nI would never bail on my brothers like this. Sorry ass family.", "No but he clearly isn't listening that he needs help, sometimes the way to help is to let them fall a little.

I\u2019m not letting my brothers embarrass themselves in front of everyone like that. We\u2019d never bail on one and other like that. \n\nWe got eachothers backs and would talk more about this.

And bailing on your brother to \u201cteach them a lesson\u201d won\u2019t be the solution.", "You \u201cain\u2019t\u201d right. Brother is a grown up and knows what will happen when he gorges. It\u2019s quite revolting. He needs to take responsibility for the well known consequence of his gluttony, ie shitting his pants."]}
