People shouldn\u2019t be grateful because someone else has it better than them.", "You are assuming the care for him is out of affection. It might just be that they are doing it for social appearances. How it would reflect on them should their son appear destitute. Some people do \"good\" things not out of pure intentions. At the end of the day, the reality is that your friend is sad because there is a need (genuine and authentic affection from his parents) that is not being met, and just because you feel that it is not a need for one to be happy doesn't make it go away. What is your definition of a friend anyway... A little understanding and empathy can go a long way. Mental health is real you don't know what thoughts take space in someone else's head.", "I\u2019m sensing that you might not feel emotions\u2026.the same way other people do.", "If someone I loved and cared about didn't want to spend the holidays with me, yes, I would be sad.

YTA. It's not a competition. Because he doesn't have to worry about the things the rest of us do, he's not allowed to experience or express pain? Based on that logic, none of us are allowed negative feelings because there is always someone,  somewhere, who has it worse.", "Do you get to spend holidays with family?", "This sounds like textbook depression. He needs help. Are you not interested in helping him at all? \n\nHere are some thing you could do instead of being all judgy on reddit:\n- ask him to go put for a coffee\n- suggest people go over to his appt for dinner\n- send him a positive text now and then\n- suggest he talk to a therapist", "The Jerk store called, and they're all out of him!", "My own parents ignored me too, I did not resent or field sad about it.

Maybe because I am lower in my pyramid I can't conceptualize the need for validation that comes from parental figures.

People are more complex than that. People can feel several emotions at the same time. I'm not entirely convinced you weren't emotionally scarred by your parents' neglect, because you absolutely sound resentful, only right now you're pointing it at your friend.\n\nIf your friend were complaining that his new car isn't comfortable enough or whatever, knowing that money is tight for you, then he'd be an inconsiderate jerk. But he's not. Being fulfilled in one area doesn't mean you can't have emotions about lacking in other areas. And one should feel safe talking to a friend about that, but clearly your friend can't open up to you.", "So why exactly did you post here? You clearly don't want to be told you're in the wrong.

Who are you to degrade someone for feeling alone or being in a different position? \n\nAt first I was going to say you had poor wording but I've read your replies in this thread.

What a myopic / self involved way of thinking.", "Okay but just because it does not make you sad does not mean it can't/shouldn't make him sad. \n\nBut honestly you seem like an outlier, i think most people rich or poor would be upset sad if their parents didn't want to spend time with them.", "Compared to them, yes.

I don't understand that.", "He means that in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, he is still struggling at the bottom, to meet his physiological needs and his need for safety. Love and esteem are above those. So he believes his friend has the luxury of missing those because his needs for safety, food, shelter, are met, without the friend needing to worry about them.\n\nSo he seems to say that he cannot feel empathy for someone higher on the pyramid when love and esteem are not on his radar on a day to day basis.\n\nWhich I can see. But humans have the ability to reason so even if he can't truly empathise, he could sympathise and recognize that though they have different needs right now, his friend has needs that are not being met. But he's not.", "Ok, help me understand then?", "You\u2019re missing the issue. You completely invalidated how they were feeling because some people have it worse than him.", "So why are you complaining then\n\nYou have no real problem.\n\nThat's your own standards\n\nYou don't think he would give every penny to just have someone who loves him unconditionally? \nHe doesn't give a fuck about the money because he is a decent human being \n\nYou only care about money and it shows that he is ten times the man you can dream of", "Because normal people have feelings and express them. It's NORMAL to be sad that someone you love and care for who is SUPPOSED TO love and care for you... Doesn't. It's NOT NORMAL to not have even the slightest semblance of emotion.

Reading some of your responses, it sounds like you've shut down a lot of your own feelings, which is a completely natural self preservation response for someone who was ignored and neglected as a child - can't get hurt if you don't have feelings! That probably protected you emotionally when you were little, but it does seem to be making it harder for you to connect and empathize with others as an adult.", "Np. Here\u2019s the definition of empathy \u201cthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.\u201d As you read, it has nothing to do with an \u201cimpulse to hurt others.

If you had empathy for him, you wouldn\u2019t be saying stuff like \u201cit could be worse\u201d or even telling him that he\u2019s privileged to his face.

But sometimes like today, I speak my mind.", "Why the insult at the end if you perceive that I can't empathize? Is it to make you feel better? Does hurting others bring you elation?
