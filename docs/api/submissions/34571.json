On our return trip, the first plane we had to take had only 4 seats per row (2 on either side of the aisle), so the seating arrangement that we had would sit my girlfriend and her sister next to each other, and I would sit right behind them next to somebody else (or, if I was lucky, next to an empty seat!). My girlfriend's sister has a fear of flying, so my girlfriend had to sit next to her, and I was okay with sitting outside of their row. We booked these seats in advance.\n\n  \nAt the airport while we were at our gate waiting to board, literally about 5 minutes before boarding started, the gate agent called me up and told me that my assigned seat had been moved 9 rows up in order to accommodate a family that had to sit together. I was not asked beforehand at all if I wanted to move my seat, and when I got to the gate agent they already had a new boarding pass printed out for me.\n\n  \nWhen I returned to my girlfriend and her sister to tell them that my seat had been moved, my girlfriend asked me why I didn't complain that they moved me and demand my original seat back, and I reply that I just didn't think to in the moment. She then tells me to go back up to the gate agent to complain, to which I say that I didn't want to, as the flight was going to be boarding *very* soon.\n\n  \nI am not a confrontational person, my girlfriend knows that, as we have been dating for over a year. We had a tight connection after this flight (less than an hour), and the flight itself was rather short (also less than an hour), so I did not think it was that big of a deal to cause a scene or risk delaying the flight even by a moment, as I was nervous about missing the connection. Not to mention that I had only found out literally 5 minutes before boarding the plane.\n\n  \nAfter this, my girlfriend got very mad at me, saying things like \"I don't know why you can't stand up for yourself\" and \"I'm pissed off that we have to sit in the back of the plane and we're not even sitting by each other\" (when I booked the flight, the back half of the plane was the only spot where all three of us could sit in close proximity, due to other seats being booked, etc; she and her sister okayed the arrangement before I booked the seats, and I did not foresee myself getting moved).\n\n  \nAfter we boarded the plane, before takeoff, my girlfriend texted me \"the 'family' behind us is a couple. good job \ud83d\udc4d\", to which I replied \"they just told me it was a family\", to which she said \"mhm\".\n\n  \nAfter the plane landed, my girlfriend didn't talk to me and seemed to ignore me for most of the rest of the day, even when I talked to her. I was seated next to her on our next flight which was much longer, and she barely talked to me or acknowledged me, which made me sad.

She needed to chill.", "NTA... it's not like you were going to be beside her. It was a short flight. She had her friend to talk to. This isn't a big thing.  It sounds like she is upset about something else.  Why would you confront the airline when you are ok with it?  It wasn't you not standing up for yourself.  But it does sound like she thinks that is an issue.  Maybe after you both get home and rest, she will have a different perspective.

Good grief.", "You need to point your girlfriend towards r/delta or r/americanairlines or r/unitedairlines, where she will see that this is extremely common (especially if you are not a frequent flyer on that airline). Once you have that new boarding pass handed to you, the decision made by the gate agent is final.  The contract of carriage - all that legalese you accept when you buy the ticket - allows the airline to change your seat to any seat they want on the plane at any time, up to and including not allowing you to board at all (involuntary bump).  Another common example: they can change equipment to a plane with fewer first class or comfort plus/premium economy seats on the new plane, and people who paid full fare for those seats are at risk of losing them.  \n\nEvery single day there are stories on the airline subs about people whose seats were changed on them.  The only thing you can do is call or email after the flight and ask for compensation (usually a flight credit or small amount of FF miles.)\n\ntl;dr:  NTA, but your girlfriend is for her reaction to you for something that was out of your control.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a confrontational person. Your girlfriend knows this but prefers that the person pushing you around is her.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, and once you found out that your girlfriend cared so much about it, it was too late to switch back. You\u2019re right that the airline staff would not have bothered with the flip-flop, and your seat had already been reassigned so there was little to insist on. Meanwhile your girlfriend probably just wanted you to be there to stow her carryon.\n\nAs for the \u201cjust a couple\u201d \u2014 you have no idea why they needed to sit together.

It seemed to me like this wasn't the first instance where you didn't stand up for yourself and she seemed to be getting really frustrated by that. There is a fine line between being a non confrontational person and being a person who lets other people walk all over them. It can get really frustating watching that as a bystander.\n\nThat being said, you didn't do anything wrong since no real damage has been done and it seemed like you were okay with the outcome.

Caring where you sit on a flight that is less than an hour is silly. Since they had already printed the boarding pass, you would have had to probably argue with a couple of gate agents.

I can say from experience that dating someone that never stands up for themself can be very frustrating. In all honesty, I doubt it was just about the seat or just about one incident. \n\nWhen you refuse to stand up for yourself, there are also situations where you're simultaneously refusing to stand up for her or you're making her deal with the consequences of your lack of confrontation. \n\nIn this case, she and her sister had to sit in the back of the plane specifically to be able to sit with you, only for you to seemingly not care in the slightest when your seat was moved. If they had known you truly didn't care, they could've got better seats. Instead, they sacrificed some of their comfort for you. Yet, you refused to even attempt to do the same. That's frustrating. The logic may check out, but when stuff like this happens over and over again, it's frustrating. \n\nAnd not just that, but it's really frustrating trying to trust someone to stand up for you and to have your back when they don't even have their own back. Especially when time after time, they let you suffer a consequence simply because they didn't want to do the bare minimum in talking to someone. \n\nSo yeah. YTA.

Does GF often blow things out of proportion? This was silly of her", "NTA but this isn\u2019t about this trip. Your gf is not reacting well to your non-confrontational patterns of behavior and you need to have a discussion about whether you\u2019ll work on that in general with her support (not guilt or shame); or whether you\u2019re happy as is and she needs to accept you for who you are.", "So, this one is definitely a NTA since it sounds like you didn't really care about your seat being moved, and, newsflash for some of the commenters below, it is okay to genuinely not be bothered by something that might bother other people as much as it is okay to be bothered by something that might not bother other people, as long as your response is reasonable, proportionate and respectful, which it sounds like OP's was.\n\nAll this said, I want to make a prediction here: OP, the second that you actually start standing up for yourself, especially if you start standing up to your GF, it will be the end of the relationship. If she genuinely just wanted you to be more assertive and stand up for yourself, she wouldn't be trying to get it by bullying and belittling you, and trying to guilt and emotionally manipulate you by giving you the silent treatment.

We fly together several times a year and are usually seated together, but there have been multiple occasions where we were separated and it was never a big deal.

I appreciate you and your gf aren't really family, but at this point if I were you I'd be pissed about being \\*told\\* I was moving rather than being asked, as the reason you were given is not good enough IMO.

I can understand that she would be upset about being separated even for a small amount of time (it's an international flight and traveling as a group is stressful even when the group is small) but you explained why you felt you had to. I think she should have been more understanding, giving you the silent treatment was childish, and her \"good job\" comment was harsh. \n\nAs a woman, I would not want to be separated from my boyfriend with a teenage sister afraid of flying on an international trip and while it might sound dumb, having someone you know and care about sitting near you can be genuinely comforting. Your presence itself can be supportive.

And while this was an international flight, it still sounds like a smaller plane given the seat configuration, so just a few hours.", "On one side, I get that she'd be pissed about the whole thing but being angry about it should have lasted that whole first flight at most (1 hour) and then she should have been able to go about with the trip without problem.

I can't do that. \ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso, when you KNOW that your partner doesn't do confrontation (like my husband), you just gotta learn to move on from some stuff, like this.

People are acting like OP forced them into the baggage hold and sold them into trafficking", "Read to me that the whole reason they were supposed to sit together was to support the sister who has a fear of flying. \n\nI think the issue is that not only did he not even try to get the seat back or explain the situation he just...did nothing. So then the GF is supporting her sister alone, despite forward planning to avoid the situation. On top of that she gets to sit next to a couple who actually fought just to sit next to each other while OP didn't even bother to try and get his seat back for a legitimate reason. \n\nWhether or not this is overboard or not really depends on if OP, who admits they are nonconfrontational, is frequently backing down from issues often enough that this is just the thing that made her snap or if this is just her being unreasonable for a weird one off situation. \n\n\"I don't know why you can't stand up for yourself\" seems fairly specific compared to just complaining about the situation itself.", "No one said he had to throw a tantrum though. They planned ahead to sit together and they had a reason for doing so (sister has fear of flying). \n\nI don't picture GF as being the problem for wanting what they actually went through the extra effort of arranging. They got moved because someone else complained about where they were sitting. \n\nThe real problem is that the airport is shuffling people around despite having assigned seats and doing it sneakily so there's few options for relief or complaint.", "I don\u2019t fly as often as I used to, but I still fly a lot.  I also work for the FAA.  He doesn\u2019t need to give up his seat to please someone else.", "Yeah, that was my original take on it, but as others pointed out in comments farther down, it's possible that OP could've been helpful.  I mean, he could've been explaining things to the flight attendants while the girlfriend comforted the sister or something.  Or handed them something from a carryon while the girlfriend tried to prevent further freakout.\n\nI agree that it seems like having OP there is overkill.  If the sister is so freaked out about flying that she requires two people dancing attendance on her, maybe she should take a boat or something.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And no, \"not a confrontational person\" does not mean \"never stands up for himself.\"", "Even so, the airport is not really the best place to \"test the confrontational waters\" since he really could have ended up missing the flight...also this was just a short connecting flight, if it were the main flight I might be more inclined to politely let them know that I was part of a group with a nervous flyer...", "And also, let's concede the point.  Let's say OP *was* a big stupid jerkbutt for this.  Let's say it *was* important for him to sit with them.  Let's say his presence *was* needed.\n\nSo then... what happened?  OP *wasn't* there, so... what awful fate befell sis?  What happened that OP's presence could have thwarted?  What about this flight would have been improved by OP sitting back there?  What specific responsibilities did he have, and then shirk?  What slack did GF have to pick up in OP's absence?\n\nBecause her giving the silent treatment means she doesn't have an answer to any of those questions because *nothing bad happened*, which was the obvious conclusion to all of this from the start.", "They'll have drinks.", "How did they sacrifice their comfort? Is there extra air in the front of the plane?", "> that couple didnt have to sit together either.\n\nJust like OP's GF and her sister didn't have to sit together?\n\nNext time, engage brain before commenting.", "Nothing, just like he did.", "I'm thinking the more extreme reactions some posters are having (calling OP a coward, implying he cares more about some random family than his own GF, saying no woman wants to be with a man who's a push over etc) are just straight up projection. OP has to remind them of someone they know in real life and they are assuming the worst of him based on their own past experiences.", "She'a the real rwd flag here. Probably entitled and gets toxic quick when things don't go her way.", "> he just...did nothing\n\nYes, but that's all he was *ever* going to be able to do under any possible set of circumstances here.

No two ways about it.\n\nBut I guess my point is that dramatically \"standing up for your partner\" at someplace like a hospital is often much less effective than quietly advocating for your partner.  Of course, if somebody's bleeding out in an ER waiting room, or their obvious complaints are being ignored by a doctor, you need to stand up in a firmer way.", "My understanding was that the rules (set by international treaty) were that the airlines had to put you on a plane towards your destination, but that things like reserved seats that you paid for were totally not guaranteed, and that it was your tough luck if you got seated elsewhere.  Especially if equipment changed.\n\nAnd where the FAA regs came in were that if you failed to obey the safety staff on the plane (flight attendants) you could definitely get kicked off the plane.  Like, if you kicked up a huge fuss about sitting with your family.", "> I agree that it seems like having OP there is overkill.\n\nI mean yeah, the seats were in pairs, so literally anything OP would have been doing would have involved blocking the aisle or getting up in his seatmate's shit", "Man, you sound like a lot of fun at parties.\n\n\"No, I'm standing next to the keg -- you got here later, so you can stand somewhere else!\"", "I think that it's because she's the one that had to sit and console her sister alone.", "Sure, and I\u2019m not claiming OP is TA here for not caring, although he could have told gf he didn\u2019t care about sitting together when they were booking flights from the get-go. I\u2019m simply responding to your comment that there\u2019s nothing toxic or related to toxic masculinity when it comes to standing up for yourself or even speaking up when a corporation screws you over. If he doesn\u2019t care, he doesn\u2019t care, but it\u2019s not toxic to say no thank you, that\u2019s not what I paid for.", "I think the issue with that is that he also theoretically could have needed to sit in close proximity to the girls for medical/whatever reasons as well\u2026but the airline didn\u2019t bother to check first. That\u2019s kinda inconsiderate, so I would be a little annoyed too. Not enough to make a stink about it though. It can feel like a slight to be involuntarily inconvenienced on behalf of strangers without at least the courtesy of being asked first. \n\nThat said, the \u201cinconvenience\u201d is pretty insignificant. This just really isn\u2019t the issue the gf is making it out to be, and it\u2019s unreasonable for her to be so upset about it, unless she\u2019s reacting to a pattern of behavior that irritates her, and not this one specific case. In which case, she should communicate that more maturely.", ">You  have no idea if that family could easily have been separated or not\n\nAnd you dont know that either. you are speculating. Nobody knows their reason. But we do know the sisters reasons. and seemingly sings OP had an empty seat beside him they just decided to accommodate the couple before even asking if it would bother him.", "gf is the kind of person to give the OP a sarcastic thumbs up and then say \"mhm\", so i'm honestly not inclined to think well of her.", "By your analogy, this would be the girlfriend getting pissed that OP didn\u2019t wash nonexistent dishes. The sink is empty, and she\u2019s pissed he isn\u2019t sat there washing imaginary dishes.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to give OP\u2019s girlfriend the benefit of the doubt (I\u2019m not), you still have to ask yourself why she is making an example out of a situation that does not back up her claims. And beyond that, even if she\u2019s right about OP never standing up for himself, she still owes him an apology for her behavior and not handling it more maturely. She\u2019s giving him the cold shoulder, which just further solidifies her emotional immaturity.", "But there is no (metaphorical) un-washed dish here!  All of the dishes are perfectly clean, nobody was left with more dishes to do!

But she is mad because he didn't do anything about it. She (and amusingly, many in this thread) have the idea that OP simply must do something in this situation. \n\nThat ties into the concept of toxic masculinity because it leads to complaining about shit that you don't actually care about, you're just doing it for your girlfriend. Then people take complaining to the next level of making a scene. And so on and so forth. \n\nAnd the inciting issue is her demanding her boyfriend complain about something he doesn't care about.", "OP mentions that he isn't very confrontational, so I imagine it was partially that he saw it as a non-issue and partially the aforementioned.\n\nPersonally in the moment I'd probably have done something similar, but if I had the clarity I would try to get SOME form of compensation out of it, phrasing it as an inconvenience.", "people who never stand up for themselves or are constantly being pushed over bc they are conflict avoidant can be extremely draining to have in your life. generally having no spine makes it hard to trust they won't agree to things that fk you over bc they don't want to \"cause an issue\". the analogy is about how a small thing happening often can make 1 instance of being annoyed by the behavior seem like an overreaction.", "I mean, it was less than an hour flight. I doubt they even had drink service so even a free extra Coke probably wasn't in the cards. OP was sitting *behind* his girlfriend and her sister, it wasn't a big enough deal to raise a stink.

EU has some wonderful passenger protections that really help with this kind of stuff, but unfortunately out here in the wilds of the US we just tell people to suck it up.)\n\nMost frequent travelers have been either at the gate or on the plane when they call for volunteers to bump, offering increasing amounts of money until someone agrees to give up their seat.  The gate agents are authorized to give over $10,000 (!!) to incentivize passengers, but they are obviously not going to do that every time; only in extreme cases.  They also don't \\*have\\* to give you cash - they routinely offer gift cards, Visa cards, travel credit with the airline, etc. but you can always ask for cash - there is an element of negotiation involved when they are getting desperate for seats.  \n\nAt the end of the day - if no one volunteers and they need the seat (usually to move pilots or crew to other locations), they \\*will\\* select someone to be involuntarily bumped.  This is what happened with that infamous situation where the guy was dragged off the United flight several years ago - they removed four paying passengers in favor of four deadheading employees.  That was an extreme situation; you are always better off just getting off the plane if they ask and then making your case at the gate or on the phone with the airline after the fact.  People who are kind, but firm, in their resolve to be compensated fairly for an involuntary bump will get a lot further than someone who digs in and refuses to move.", "lol this is probably the real truth op isn\u2019t speaking", "This is my thinking. That yes this was, per se, a trivial issue but the zillionth issue he didn\u2019t stand up for himself for. Plus he said he pre booked the seats to fly together. So why not just ask the question?

Maybe he saw no need to. Maybe he doesn\u2019t like drama. I mean, I\u2019d have asked for the sake of asking. Like you\u2019re moving me from my seat I pre booked to be with my family why?
