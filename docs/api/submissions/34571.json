On our return trip, the first plane we had to take had only 4 seats per row (2 on either side of the aisle), so the seating arrangement that we had would sit my girlfriend and her sister next to each other, and I would sit right behind them next to somebody else (or, if I was lucky, next to an empty seat!). My girlfriend's sister has a fear of flying, so my girlfriend had to sit next to her, and I was okay with sitting outside of their row. We booked these seats in advance.\n\n  \nAt the airport while we were at our gate waiting to board, literally about 5 minutes before boarding started, the gate agent called me up and told me that my assigned seat had been moved 9 rows up in order to accommodate a family that had to sit together. I was not asked beforehand at all if I wanted to move my seat, and when I got to the gate agent they already had a new boarding pass printed out for me.\n\n  \nWhen I returned to my girlfriend and her sister to tell them that my seat had been moved, my girlfriend asked me why I didn't complain that they moved me and demand my original seat back, and I reply that I just didn't think to in the moment. She then tells me to go back up to the gate agent to complain, to which I say that I didn't want to, as the flight was going to be boarding *very* soon.\n\n  \nI am not a confrontational person, my girlfriend knows that, as we have been dating for over a year. We had a tight connection after this flight (less than an hour), and the flight itself was rather short (also less than an hour), so I did not think it was that big of a deal to cause a scene or risk delaying the flight even by a moment, as I was nervous about missing the connection. Not to mention that I had only found out literally 5 minutes before boarding the plane.\n\n  \nAfter this, my girlfriend got very mad at me, saying things like \"I don't know why you can't stand up for yourself\" and \"I'm pissed off that we have to sit in the back of the plane and we're not even sitting by each other\" (when I booked the flight, the back half of the plane was the only spot where all three of us could sit in close proximity, due to other seats being booked, etc; she and her sister okayed the arrangement before I booked the seats, and I did not foresee myself getting moved).\n\n  \nAfter we boarded the plane, before takeoff, my girlfriend texted me \"the 'family' behind us is a couple. good job \ud83d\udc4d\", to which I replied \"they just told me it was a family\", to which she said \"mhm\".\n\n  \nAfter the plane landed, my girlfriend didn't talk to me and seemed to ignore me for most of the rest of the day, even when I talked to her. I was seated next to her on our next flight which was much longer, and she barely talked to me or acknowledged me, which made me sad.

Good grief.", "You need to point your girlfriend towards r/delta or r/americanairlines or r/unitedairlines, where she will see that this is extremely common (especially if you are not a frequent flyer on that airline). Once you have that new boarding pass handed to you, the decision made by the gate agent is final.  The contract of carriage - all that legalese you accept when you buy the ticket - allows the airline to change your seat to any seat they want on the plane at any time, up to and including not allowing you to board at all (involuntary bump).  Another common example: they can change equipment to a plane with fewer first class or comfort plus/premium economy seats on the new plane, and people who paid full fare for those seats are at risk of losing them.  \n\nEvery single day there are stories on the airline subs about people whose seats were changed on them.  The only thing you can do is call or email after the flight and ask for compensation (usually a flight credit or small amount of FF miles.)\n\ntl;dr:  NTA, but your girlfriend is for her reaction to you for something that was out of your control.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a confrontational person. Your girlfriend knows this but prefers that the person pushing you around is her.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, and once you found out that your girlfriend cared so much about it, it was too late to switch back. You\u2019re right that the airline staff would not have bothered with the flip-flop, and your seat had already been reassigned so there was little to insist on. Meanwhile your girlfriend probably just wanted you to be there to stow her carryon.\n\nAs for the \u201cjust a couple\u201d \u2014 you have no idea why they needed to sit together.

It seemed to me like this wasn't the first instance where you didn't stand up for yourself and she seemed to be getting really frustrated by that. There is a fine line between being a non confrontational person and being a person who lets other people walk all over them. It can get really frustating watching that as a bystander.\n\nThat being said, you didn't do anything wrong since no real damage has been done and it seemed like you were okay with the outcome.

Caring where you sit on a flight that is less than an hour is silly. Since they had already printed the boarding pass, you would have had to probably argue with a couple of gate agents.

I can say from experience that dating someone that never stands up for themself can be very frustrating. In all honesty, I doubt it was just about the seat or just about one incident. \n\nWhen you refuse to stand up for yourself, there are also situations where you're simultaneously refusing to stand up for her or you're making her deal with the consequences of your lack of confrontation. \n\nIn this case, she and her sister had to sit in the back of the plane specifically to be able to sit with you, only for you to seemingly not care in the slightest when your seat was moved. If they had known you truly didn't care, they could've got better seats. Instead, they sacrificed some of their comfort for you. Yet, you refused to even attempt to do the same. That's frustrating. The logic may check out, but when stuff like this happens over and over again, it's frustrating. \n\nAnd not just that, but it's really frustrating trying to trust someone to stand up for you and to have your back when they don't even have their own back. Especially when time after time, they let you suffer a consequence simply because they didn't want to do the bare minimum in talking to someone. \n\nSo yeah. YTA.

Does GF often blow things out of proportion? This was silly of her", "NTA but this isn\u2019t about this trip. Your gf is not reacting well to your non-confrontational patterns of behavior and you need to have a discussion about whether you\u2019ll work on that in general with her support (not guilt or shame); or whether you\u2019re happy as is and she needs to accept you for who your are.", "So, this one is definitely a NTA since it sounds like you didn't really care about your seat being moved, and, newsflash for some of the commenters below, it is okay to genuinely not be bothered by something that might bother other people as much as it is okay to be bothered by something that might not bother other people, as long as your response is reasonable, proportionate and respectful, which it sounds like OP's was.\n\nAll this said, I want to make a prediction here: OP, the second that you actually start standing up for yourself, especially if you start standing up to your GF, it will be the end of the relationship. If she genuinely just wanted you to be more assertive and stand up for yourself, she wouldn't be trying to get it by bullying and belittling you, and trying to guilt and emotionally manipulate you by giving you the silent treatment.

I can understand that she would be upset about being separated even for a small amount of time (it's an international flight and traveling as a group is stressful even when the group is small) but you explained why you felt you had to. I think she should have been more understanding, giving you the silent treatment was childish, and her \"good job\" comment was harsh. \n\nAs a woman, I would not want to be separated from my boyfriend with a teenage sister afraid of flying on an international trip and while it might sound dumb, having someone you know and care about sitting near you can be genuinely comforting. Your presence itself can be supportive.

And while this was an international flight, it still sounds like a smaller plane given the seat configuration, so just a few hours.", "On one side, I get that she'd be pissed about the whole thing but being angry about it should have lasted that whole first flight at most (1 hour) and then she should have been able to go about with the trip without problem.

I can't do that. \ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso, when you KNOW that your partner doesn't do confrontation (like my husband), you just gotta learn to move on from some stuff, like this.

It\u2019s beyond my comprehension level that this is \u2018normal\u2019", "Yeah he\u2019s just willing to role over and take it like oh well who cares. Would drive me bat shit crazy if I was his GF:", "Maybe he just doesn't care where he sits, so he was being accommodating.  For fuck's sake, \"you should be more upset about this\" is such an aggravating viewpoint.  Being treated like that, I probably would have told the GF, \"look, I don't actually care where I sit, and the way you're acting makes me a little relieved I'm going to be 9 rows away from you for a little while.\"", "I disagree with this. Sitting behind his girlfriend is hardly quality time. You can\u2019t really engage that much with that seating arrangement. So if he got moved a few rows up for an hour flight what does it matter? It\u2019s not worth the energy and time for less than 60 minutes of flight time. The fact that the girlfriend gave him the silent treatment for the rest of the day is a huge red flag. Girlfriend is the only asshole here", "I was trying to figure out a way to say this. OP seems a bit of a pushover, and I\u2019m not sure the gf\u2019s reaction is down to her being upset that he wasn\u2019t close to her or that she wasn\u2019t able to control him.\n\nAlso wondering exactly why they didn\u2019t pick up their boarding passes together, when she could have reacted directly to this situation herself.\n\nThat said, the silent treatment is childish and hurtful. But without knowing a lot more about the dynamics I\u2019m going with ESH as both sides could have done more.", ">this was a post about a 6ft person who paid for extra legroom being moved the internet would be up in arms about it. But for you they\u2019re just \u201cno your gf is toxic, leave her\u201d.\n\nThe difference is that OP isn't angry or complaining about the seat move.  OP figured it was just an hour so what's the big deal?", "You have a choice at that time of taking your new seat or being escorted off the plane by some government agents.", "He should cut her loose as soon as the plane lands.", "You mean not throwing a hissy fit about things he doesn't care about?", "even shorter than that, op said the flight wasn't even a full hour", "I'm guessing this is about far more than the seat. By OP's own words, he never stands up for himself.", "same could be said about the family/couple who changed their seats last minute causing all of this.", "Found the girlfriend, lol.", "I completely agree with you, but to play devils advocate here, why did that other couple **have** to sit together. they could have been separated just as easily, after all the flight wanst even an hour, right? GF is still the biggest AH here, but that couple didnt have to sit together either.", "After reading this I'm wondering if her reaction was based off of past events of similar actions. She is just fed up with it and at this point, even the small stuff that doesn't matter much is a huge deal.\n\nShe is overreacting but alot of that emotion could be comming from other incidents. Ya know the whole thing of a bunch of small issues turning into one big giant issue.", "Maybe one of them has a phobia about flying, or medical issues where they might need assistance, just like OP's girlfriend's sister needs to be with the girlfriend so she couldn't sit with OP.", "Small kids? Several people with flightphobia and needing support? One or more family members with autism? One family member just died and they were supporting each other in grief?\n\nLike why could gf and her sister be separated, it wouldn't have been big deal and done easily? Oh wait, no it couldn't. You  have no idea if that family could easily have been separated or not.", "Yeah as they say it\u2019s the straw that breaks the camels back. It\u2019s never the big thing people end up cracking it over I find, there is usually lots of big and small things in the lead up and by the time they truly get angry, it is usually about something minor.", "Absolutely! We need to know more than we\u2019ll ever get from an info request.", "I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're trying to say.", "or maybe that couple just wanted to sit together with no other deeper reason. it happens.", "Just based off the sentence \"never stand up for yourself\" and personal experience, I'd confidently say this is about far more than just a seat.", "youre saying theyre bad.\n\nim saying it was travel, people got cranky, not a big deal.\n\nwhats hard about that?", "Shes not a toddler, treating people like shit because your cranky stops being acceptable when you're like 5 years old."]}
