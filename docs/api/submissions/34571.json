On our return trip, the first plane we had to take had only 4 seats per row (2 on either side of the aisle), so the seating arrangement that we had would sit my girlfriend and her sister next to each other, and I would sit right behind them next to somebody else (or, if I was lucky, next to an empty seat!). My girlfriend's sister has a fear of flying, so my girlfriend had to sit next to her, and I was okay with sitting outside of their row. We booked these seats in advance.\n\n  \nAt the airport while we were at our gate waiting to board, literally about 5 minutes before boarding started, the gate agent called me up and told me that my assigned seat had been moved 9 rows up in order to accommodate a family that had to sit together. I was not asked beforehand at all if I wanted to move my seat, and when I got to the gate agent they already had a new boarding pass printed out for me.\n\n  \nWhen I returned to my girlfriend and her sister to tell them that my seat had been moved, my girlfriend asked me why I didn't complain that they moved me and demand my original seat back, and I reply that I just didn't think to in the moment. She then tells me to go back up to the gate agent to complain, to which I say that I didn't want to, as the flight was going to be boarding *very* soon.\n\n  \nI am not a confrontational person, my girlfriend knows that, as we have been dating for over a year. We had a tight connection after this flight (less than an hour), and the flight itself was rather short (also less than an hour), so I did not think it was that big of a deal to cause a scene or risk delaying the flight even by a moment, as I was nervous about missing the connection. Not to mention that I had only found out literally 5 minutes before boarding the plane.\n\n  \nAfter this, my girlfriend got very mad at me, saying things like \"I don't know why you can't stand up for yourself\" and \"I'm pissed off that we have to sit in the back of the plane and we're not even sitting by each other\" (when I booked the flight, the back half of the plane was the only spot where all three of us could sit in close proximity, due to other seats being booked, etc; she and her sister okayed the arrangement before I booked the seats, and I did not foresee myself getting moved).\n\n  \nAfter we boarded the plane, before takeoff, my girlfriend texted me \"the 'family' behind us is a couple. good job \ud83d\udc4d\", to which I replied \"they just told me it was a family\", to which she said \"mhm\".\n\n  \nAfter the plane landed, my girlfriend didn't talk to me and seemed to ignore me for most of the rest of the day, even when I talked to her. I was seated next to her on our next flight which was much longer, and she barely talked to me or acknowledged me, which made me sad. I don't think it is fair that she is very mad at me for something that is outside of my control, but I just want a third party opinion on this if IATA.", "created_utc": 1704686834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191c28k/aita_for_not_complaining_that_my_plane_seat_got/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needed to chill.", "NTA... it's not like you were going to be beside her. It was a short flight. She had her friend to talk to. This isn't a big thing.  It sounds like she is upset about something else.  Why would you confront the airline when you are ok with it?  It wasn't you not standing up for yourself.  But it does sound like she thinks that is an issue.  Maybe after you both get home and rest, she will have a different perspective.  Traveling can bring out the best and worst of people.", "Complaining wouldn\u2019t have changed a thing. Airlines don\u2019t care what you think, that\u2019s also why they didn\u2019t ask you. You are not the asshole, your girlfriend was however totally unreasonable. The way your girlfriend treats you is toxic. She is trying to punish you by ignoring you, what a child. \n\nIf you let people piss on you, they will piss on you. It\u2019s time that you stand up to your girlfriend, her behavior is controlling and toxic and she wouldn\u2019t act like that if you didn\u2019t allow it. \n\nYou need to tell her that you are in a partnership and that she isn\u2019t the boss of you.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a good sign for someone to be so angry and punitive over such a nothing issue. Keep your eyes and options open.", "Nta, I don\u2019t see why she cares so much.\n\nIf you not standing up for yourself is a larger problem in the relationship, then that\u2019s not a bad thing to address, but a flight is not the time to do that for all the reasons you listed above.", "NTA\nShe way over reacted! You were not sitting together anyway.", "NTA she being dramatic and unreasonable for no reason.", "NTA. Why does she care so much where you sit **on a flight that is less than an hour?** Does she need to be glued to you 24/7? Good grief.", "You need to point your girlfriend towards r/delta or r/americanairlines or r/unitedairlines, where she will see that this is extremely common (especially if you are not a frequent flyer on that airline). Once you have that new boarding pass handed to you, the decision made by the gate agent is final.  The contract of carriage - all that legalese you accept when you buy the ticket - allows the airline to change your seat to any seat they want on the plane at any time, up to and including not allowing you to board at all (involuntary bump).  Another common example: they can change equipment to a plane with fewer first class or comfort plus/premium economy seats on the new plane, and people who paid full fare for those seats are at risk of losing them.  \n\nEvery single day there are stories on the airline subs about people whose seats were changed on them.  The only thing you can do is call or email after the flight and ask for compensation (usually a flight credit or small amount of FF miles.)\n\ntl;dr:  NTA, but your girlfriend is for her reaction to you for something that was out of your control.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a confrontational person. Your girlfriend knows this but prefers that the person pushing you around is her.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, and once you found out that your girlfriend cared so much about it, it was too late to switch back. You\u2019re right that the airline staff would not have bothered with the flip-flop, and your seat had already been reassigned so there was little to insist on. Meanwhile your girlfriend probably just wanted you to be there to stow her carryon.\n\nAs for the \u201cjust a couple\u201d \u2014 you have no idea why they needed to sit together. Maybe one of them was afraid of flying.", "NTA. It sounds like you guys have deeper underlying issues than this seating thing.", "NTA. But I do understand your girlfriend's point somehow. It seemed to me like this wasn't the first instance where you didn't stand up for yourself and she seemed to be getting really frustrated by that. There is a fine line between being a non confrontational person and being a person who lets other people walk all over them. It can get really frustating watching that as a bystander.\n\nThat being said, you didn't do anything wrong since no real damage has been done and it seemed like you were okay with the outcome. You both just need to have a good conversation tbh.", "NTA, your girlfriend sounds like a nightmare. And if it were her who wanted to sit next to you, she would have wanted someone to move to accommodate her.", "NTA, can understand her being momentarily annoyed or frustrated, but punishing you and ignoring you the rest of the day is emotionally immature, manipulative etc. also what airline was this so I can avoid it", "I\u2019m so torn here. Like, your gf had her sister beside her and would have totally been ok without you being there\u2026 but I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t speak up when your ticket was changed?\n\n\u201cWell I have paid for my seat to be behind my gf and her sister who doesn\u2019t fly well. Can\u2019t you move someone else?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a hard thing to say. Plus you paid to be together, albeit not on the same row for the requirements of the plane.\n\nIf this was a post about a 6ft person who paid for extra legroom being moved the internet would be up in arms about it. But for you they\u2019re just \u201cno your gf is toxic, leave her\u201d.\n\nTbh I think this is a bigger issue for you both. You didn\u2019t try to address or fix the issue, and now she\u2019s mad, but obviously portraying it in the wrong way by just ignoring you and not talking about the issue.\n\nESH - except the sister\n\nEdit sister for friend.", "Nta", "NTA. Your girlfriend is behaving like a spoiled toddler. Is that something you\u2019re ok with going forward? Think about it, because this type of behavior will be repeated.", "NTA\n\nThis was not an argument worth having. The flight was less than an hour, and your girlfriend's sister wasn't forced to fly alone. I doubt you would have interacted much with them being sat behind them anyway.\n\nThough, OP, you mention you're not a confrontational person. Does that extend to potentially being a bit of a doormat and/or your girlfriend having to stand up for you? I wonder if this is less about the seat change and more a general frustration on how you handle similar situations.", "You should thank god for showing you what the next 20 years of your life are going to be like until she decides she wants  to leave you", "YTA.

That just sounds annoying.\n\nIs this abnormal behavior?  Was she having a bad day in general?  It sounds like something deeper must be the issue.

Caring where you sit on a flight that is less than an hour is silly. Since they had already printed the boarding pass, you would have had to probably argue with a couple of gate agents. Should they have moved you like that? No, but traveling is stressful enough without getting yourself worked up over nothing.

If she wants bf to argue to sit together, surely she\u2019s willing to do it as well?\n\nMy parents spend that long deliberately separated at airports just getting luggage and wandering off for coffee.\n\nHe could have argued last minute with the gate attendant and the flight attendants and the airline, and gotten to stay, sure.
