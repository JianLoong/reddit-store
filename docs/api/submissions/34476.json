Often times my mom would complain about no one doing anything around the house and calls me and my sister lazy, I usually don\u2019t say anything to those complaints, but sometimes i get irritated and say i actually clean around the house and that you only sleep so of course you wouldn't pay attention.\n \nMoving forward a year or so when my mom announced she was pregnant, I was kinda of irritated because she would always complain about bills and how she needed to catch up on them, I proceeded to say how are you going to say you need to catch up on bills but then have another child, I cant remember what she had told me, but a month or two later the reason she wanted to have another kid was because \u201cI love being a mother\u201d in my head at the time I kinda seen it as selfish as she didn\u2019t want to be \u201calone\u201d. \n\nSomewhere in June or July (2023) my mom was pregnant but then had a miscarriage 5 weeks later, 2 weeks later she gets pregnant again with a girl.\n\nI wanted to work over the summer and be a little bit more independent as I\u2019m only a few years from being a legal adult so I ask my mom can I work, she says yes but she needs to get money for an ID.

She's not being a mother to the kids she has now.  How will that change once she adds 1 more?\n\nNTA.  Ask your dad to take you to get an ID (and Social Security Card if you are in the US).

It's not your job to be the caregiver for your younger siblings, and even more will be expected of you once the new addition arrives.", "NTA If your parents were struggling to take care of the two kids they already had they shouldn't keep having them.", "NTA. A clear cut case of parentification.  You\u2019re absolutely right. Your parents are being selfish and irresponsible. You are a teenager.

Do you mean ID documents to get a job?", "NTA. You are being __parentified__ ( google it, if you need to). And that is not OK. The only reason why your mother is preventing you from going out to work is because she needs your free labour in the home. _Babysitting, cleaning etc._ She should be ashamed of herself. And then having another baby on top of the ones that she already can't cope with that is beyond the pale. In two years time you will be able to do as you please as long as you can pay. Nobody would blame you for not paying much attention to the family by then. And your mother is going to have to find herself another little House Elf to catch up the slack in the household. But I guess that will be your oldest sister's problem by then.", "NTA, and I have to say this gently, Please do not take as accusatory.  Is there any possibility you were not born in the country and are undocumented and she has no ID for you.", "OP you are being pareitnefied which is a form of emotional abuse.  It sounds like your mom may be flirting with emotional  incest as well, you are her child not her spouse.   Anyways focus on school/ make your gtfo plan for after you graduate and in the meantime know you sound like a badass human :)", "NTA.

If he doesn\u2019t have the money, borrow it. It can\u2019t be a huge amount. You can pay it back when you get your job. You need that job if your mother is refusing to pay for your phone and ridiculously saying your girlfriend should pay for it. Get yourself ready to move out. Keep doing a reasonable amount of chores, but if you are forced to babysit, swap out the time. Your 14yo sister can pick up some of the slack, and when you escape from your house, you can help her get out as well.", "Sadly it's gonna be worse until you can leave.

Your mother expects kids to raise kids. Unfair. It seems you pitch in and now your mother has sabotaged your efforts to get a job to pay for your expenses.

Perhaps talk with your father to find a solution in the meantime. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nBut this isn't changing. Start prepping to leave. That means getting a job and a safe place to put the money. A safe place is NOT a bank account with your parents' names on it. I wouldn't trust your mom not to take it. You need a small safe with a code. Something solid enough that it can't be broken into.\n\nGet your birth certificate and other important paperwork. Or get copies of them.", "Scorching take: ESH but if I may put a positive on my judgement, I think your mother may be mentally and hormonally imbalanced to such a degree that it's gonna be hard for her to return to reality when either menopause hits, she declines a lot from all this mentally, or a doctor forbids her from getting pregnant (the fact she got pregnant so quick after a miscarriage is concerning). What is your father doing in all this? He's one shy of a basketball game lineup, and you haven't mentioned anything about him except that he works a few less hours than your mother. Is he encouraging this? It's really hard to not feel for both you and your mother, but you saying that is extremely cutting in a time where she needs help. Something has to give. Also look into this: pregnancy addiction. \n\nhttps://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19928039/octomom-syndrome/\n\nEdit: After reading some other comments I'm pretty convinced this may be happening. Also, your dad's lack of energy is from consistent procreation. Oof, this is very unfortunate all around.", "YTA if you said that. \n\nThat doesn't mean your parents don't have some problems, because we all do, but your attitude is bad. Yes, it is everyone's job to clean the house and help each other in a family. You need some life experience out on your own, for many years, before you can judge them.  \n\nIf you want to make some changes, let your parents know you want to schedule a time for a serious talk. Then calmly and rationally ask for ehat you need (not want), like your work ID, and show how this will contribute to the family.
