The only reason why your mother is preventing you from going out to work is because she needs your free labour in the home. _Babysitting, cleaning etc._ She should be ashamed of herself. And then having another baby on top of the ones that she already can't cope with that is beyond the pale. In two years time you will be able to do as you please as long as you can pay. Nobody would blame you for not paying much attention to the family by then. And your mother is going to have to find herself another little House Elf to catch up the slack in the household.

What is your father doing in all this? He's one shy of a basketball game lineup, and you haven't mentioned anything about him except that he works a few less hours than your mother.

Yes, it is everyone's job to clean the house and help each other in a family. You need some life experience out on your own, for many years, before you can judge them.  \n\nIf you want to make some changes, let your parents know you want to schedule a time for a serious talk.

Expecting your girlfriend to pay your phone bill - presumably who also is a minor - is ridiculous.\n\nAND you asked to get a job.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely worth examining if you are half-assing things - and as a parent she should be specific. Because she and your father should be teaching you this stuff, especially at your age.\n\nHere are a few simple things to ask yourself:\n\nDo you put stuff away in the proper place, or do you just shove it out of sight? Do you vacuum and not empty the canister after? Do you and your sister (who should also be helping) ever clean the refrigerator? Wipe down the counters? Fill up the trashcan, and take it out? There may actually be a legitimate complaint here, but it\u2019s not being communicated very well.\n\nAnd of course you are going to spend more time with your girlfriend than your baby sibling. You aren\u2019t a third parent either, and it sounds like she\u2019s putting a lot of pressure on you. \n\nI also think it\u2019s a bit unfair to be mad at you for asking for things you want when you are still a minor and don\u2019t have your own job.\n\nPeople will often say you aren\u2019t obligated to watch your siblings - but relationships don\u2019t really function well when you make it about obligations. What\u2019s a reasonable expectation in this case often comes down to how often/how long - are you being expected to watch your baby sibling like a third parent, or is this a couple of times a week? How often are you able to keep plans with your friends? None of those are answered here - and I\u2019m asking them more for you to think about - you don\u2019t need to provide an answer. And, your sister is certainly old enough as well to be contributing. Being expected to help more as you get older isn\u2019t necessarily parentification. If you become responsible for the majority of your sibling\u2019s care, THAT is a problem - but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case?\n\nI do think your mom is being an asshole here, and I\u2019m concerned that you don\u2019t mention your father other than his work hours. 40-50 can certainly be tiring, but not so tiring he shouldn\u2019t be caring for his own small child with his wife or doing house chores. Why hasn\u2019t he handled getting your ID for you? How much of this is really about you, and more that your dad isn\u2019t stepping up but he\u2019s not going to change? \n\nKeep pushing for the job, especially if you are going to be expected to pay your own phone bill.

Parenting is so hard, especially for the mom, and I can\u2019t even imagine working that many hours and still trying to maintain a house. My mom was a working mom and I know from the kid perspective it can be so frustrating when they yell at you to do chores, or step up, and it feels like their never around.

I think some banks usually have special accounts for underage kids so minimal balance and minimal to no fees. \n\nUse the excuse your mom is too tired and you don\u2019t want to bother her.  \n\nReason for the account is hiding cash at home never seems to turn out well as in siblings, friends of siblings or parents find it and keep it. \n\nBe sure you have access to the account so you yourself can deposit as well as withdraw funds without anyone else approving it.   Also to update the profile. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest it be made paperless so no statements come to your house and with your email as the primary contact.  \n\nIf you get a debit card be sure to use a pin no one else will guess.
