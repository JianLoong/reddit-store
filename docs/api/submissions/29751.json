Hmm, tough one... I'm gonna go with YTA.", "If being an asshole wasn\u2019t your end goal what was and how did your actions in this story contribute to that goal?\n\nWhy even host a wake for a woman you hated if not for this very purpose?", "YTA.\nThere's a time and a place, and that definitely wasn't it.", "YTA. Did you feel better for having done that? You can bet you didn\u2019t heal any wounds your husband carries from his own personal traumas. There you are compounding his already fragile emotions because even in death, the very mention of his mother brings out the worst in people and since everyone already knows that, allowing his sister to speak, however falsely was the least you could have done in support of your husband in his time of mixed grief and anxiety. Way to go\u2026", "YTA. \n\nIf you had such a rough relationship with your MIL then you (and your father) had the option to NOT attend the wake. You could have stayed in your bedroom or otherwise refused to host and just let your husband handle it. Instead you decided to make it all about you and your feelings, create a scene and embarrass your husband. Your dad even joined in the fun. \n\nThis event was not a time for you to air grievances and was certainly not a time for your dad to speak at all.", "YTA. The goal of the wake was to bring comfort to the living, not settlings scores.\n\nYour husband is grieving and you are shitting on his grief like he doesn't matter. You are supposed to be there to comfort him, not make his life harder during his hardships.", "YTA\n\nRegardless of previous relationships and everything, \n\nWhy did you and YOUR family make the wake all about yourselves? Weird.", "YTA. Joanne is allowed to remember her mother however she wants to, even if it doesn't match your perspective. Honestly, I can't think of more heinous thing to do to someone who's grieving. Or did it even cross your mind that Joanne might be struggling with this? No, you had to be \"right\" and that's more important that anyone else's grief.\n\nI don't know why you hosted a wake for someone you clearly hate so much. You must have known that's a time when people remember the GOOD things about the person that died. Did you just want to correct everyone's opinions?", "YTA\n\nA wake is not the time for that.", "YTA. Your role at your husband\u2019s mother\u2019s funeral is to support your husband. You made it about you. This is not how you behave at wakes, and your children are now very, very confused. And your mother sided with Joanne because she knows it was harder for Joanne to speak kindly about someone she had a complicated relationship with, than for you to sit and listen to it.", "YTA\n\nAnd you are evil and selfish.\n\nI pity your husband married to someone like you.\n\nThat poor man.....", "YTA\n\nYou can think what you like, but you don't air laundry in public. No matter what you thought of this woman, this was her funeral. She was a human being and a couple of hours of respect wouldn't have killed you. You could have bitched about her in your own time. You can't have a do-over on a funeral, that was it. And that's what everyone will remember. She may have been a nightmare, but on the one day her life was remembered, you made it about you.", "This was technically your husband\u2019s family. If anyone had a right to make a comment, it may be him, but I\u2019m not sure why you felt it made sense to disparage his mom just after she died. It doesn\u2019t sound like he felt vindicated.\n\nYou may have had issues, or perceived that others did, but there were real feelings of loss in the room. This is a \u2018if you can\u2019t say something nice, don\u2019t say it\u2019 situation. \n\nYou were worried about being hypocrites in front of your kids? How about showing them how to be compassionate, civil, or composed? How to be dignified? \n\nI feel what you did was quite hypocritical. Issues should be aired while this person was alive - not during a wake. If this person was so bad that you felt it was necessary to disparage them at their wake, you should not go to the service. \n\nIt\u2019s a time to remember them - flaws and all - and celebrate the good that was in them. If you couldn\u2019t find a single thing to celebrate, you didn\u2019t belong there.\nYTA", "I think this is a case of being right, but picking the wrong time to have a discussion about it. Joanna seems to have used her problematic mother for her own gain, so maybe her comments were meant to reconcile something in her. Who knows. But you will probably never get her to see your point, so starting a discussion in an already emotional setting wasn't the best move.", "YTA. That\u2019s a wholly inappropriate time to talk poorly of her. And pulling the \u201cthis is my house and I can do what I want\u201d card. You owe everyone an apology.", "YTA, you might not be as far into the asshole territory as she was, but you're now in her realm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut yeah!! I'm sure that in justice had to be righted at that very moment!", "Yta. You shouldnt have held the wake if you couldnt keep it respectful. There are plenty of people whose graves id love to spit on but id never do it in front of their greiving loved ones.", "YTA sounds like he married his mother", "YTA\n\nWhy are you bothering internet strangers with this? You intended to be rude, you were rude, and you're proud of being rude. WTH could we say that would matter?\n\nYou made your husband's grief worse, and his sister's worse, too. Toxic or not, she was *their* mother and your comments were unnecessary, uncalled for, and unkind.", "Yta, you could have spoken to your kids afterwards to explain.", "In my opinion: YTA\n\nImho You embarrassed your husband in front of your family by causing an unnecessary scene at an unnecessary time. You ironically allowed your MIL to control you once more by not swallowing your issues(at the very least until later) and being the better person.", "Well, that was super inappropriate of you. You and your dad owe Phil and his family an apology. YTA.", "Everyone sucks here. The survivors are the witness to what she was really like. Roll your eyes, shake your head, but don\u2019t cause a scene. She\u2019s gone, don\u2019t let her continue to live in your head rent free", "NTA, I did something similar at my grandmother's wake, I'm a child abuse survivor and my grandmother was my abuser and any notions of \"positive\" memories from me was met with more or less the cold hard information that on top of my disabilities, bullying at school and depression I had to get knocked around by a hateful woman who never should have had children to start with let alone be allow to look after anyone else's, the only real difference here is my aunts and uncles are big fans of gallows humor so this resulted in a massive roast of the recently deceased.", "YTA.  Remind me to never attend a wake at your home.  Let me guess, one of your complaints about your MIL was that she was over-dramatic, liked to cause a scene and didn\u2019t care about how her actions would affect those she was supposed to care about.  Sound familiar?", "YTA", " Did you enjoy what you did to them? Sounds like you did. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour husband and his sister lost their mother 2 days ago. Even with the abuse, her kids are likely experiencing a very wide range emotions from sadness for having lost a parent, joy for finally being free from her, guilt at feeling joy, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s their time to process their emotions and grieve however they feel fit. Not yours.\n\nJoanne coped by trying to put on a strong face because that\u2019s what people do at a wake. No one gets up and talks about what a horrible human the deceased was in real life even if everyone knows the score.\n\nA wake is the LAST place to set the record straight. What were you even thinking?\n\nYou embarrassed your husband (and yourself) in front of his entire extended family on an already incredibly emotional day. Shame on you.", "YTA.  Let people have an idealized version of the deceased at the wake.  Your actions were petty, rude, disrespectful, and lower yourself to the level you say your MIL was.  YOU set the poor example for your children.", "YTA. You are not the one who has just lost their mother, but instead of supporting your husband and his family you had to make it about you. No one gives a damn how you feel about it, or your father. The lesson you've taught your children is to fuck anyone else's pain, make every situation about themselves and to trample over appropriate behaviour.", "YTA. It was a wake. You confronted and abused someone who was grieving a death. If you didn\u2019t agree with what she was saying, you should have kept your mouth shut until you could vent with someone who did agree with you. By reacting as you did, you\u2019ve shown yourself to be as horrible and bitter as the woman you just buried, so guess what? *She wins again.*   \n\n\nYou re-traumatised your husband, and you\u2019ve turned everyone against you. Was it worth it? Do you feel better now? There are healthier and more constructive ways to deal with stuff like this - at the wake, in front of everyone, attacking a grieving relative, is not one of them.", "YTA. It wasn't the time or place. Joanne is allowed to have her own perspective without needing your approval. She could be mourning the person she wishes her mother was; or not want the extra stress of dealing with people's reactions to the truth.", "YTA! Why have a wake for someone, if the only goal was to insult her and be the ahole?\n\nHypocrisy wouldn't create a bad example for your children but your behaviour will.\n\nIrrespective of your IL's relationship with her children, this was not the time nor the place. You and your dad are massive aholes.", "YTA. You started petty drama at a funeral.  You acted with 0 class.", "No bc why would you? Tf is wrong w people", "It's not really the time and place...", "Yta. \n\nYour husband and sister-in-law get to set the pace in this instance.  Not your place to fight their battle if they did not want to at that moment.", "YTA. People act funny when they've just lost loved ones, and this can be either positive or negative. It is not a good time to air grievances that are not yours to reveal, because you cannot predict how anyone will react, not even the actual victims. You took a risk and got burned, because in the end this wasn't actually what the victim wanted.", "NTA. You called out a bunch of hypocrites being politically correct. Funerals are not necessarily to celebrate the dead. They are to verify the dead.", "Is this a joke? Of course you are TA. I don\u2019t care what his relationship was with his mom or sister, you made what was an incredibly emotional and stressful day for your husband worse. Your husband was not forced to host a wake at his house, and if he had no feelings of love towards his mom he would not have, the fact that he did says a lot. Also the fact that you mention several times about your SIL\u2019s financial motives for everything makes me sure what you really were pissed at was that you husband may have to split any inheritance with his sister.", "YTA \n\nA wake is not the time for this.\n\nThe deceased person\u2019s daughter is entitled to focus on good things if they want to.  \n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide how other people grieve.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide how other people remember a deceased person.\n\nEdit to add: wanting a wake for an abusive parent isn\u2019t hypocritical.  Abuse victims grieve for the mother they never had and now that she\u2019s dead there is no chance of her ever being what they needed.  That is worthy of grief.  You\u2019re so full of your own self righteousness.  This isn\u2019t about you.  Your feelings are irrelevant .  \n\nDo you make everything about you?  You might want to get yourself checked for a personality disorder - perhaps your husband married you because your abuse felt so familiar.", "YTA - There's a time and place, and you hurt your husband in the process of you getting something off your chest at an inappropriate time. \n\nEven if she was awful, she was still his mother and he obviously cared about her.", "I wouldn\u2019t say NTA bc it did seem to make the husband who was already upset feel worse by the scene but at the same time the YTA all seem way to harsh as it seeemd to just erupt as well as the fact as having to honor someone who treated your husband and probably you poorly in your own home is just emotionally taxing all they people saying it\u2019s disrespectful should be be taken with a grain of salt wakes are about how the living process the death and that was how it ended up being for you I felt like. I know I would have felt better doing that then just suffering in silence for someone horrid. Best wishes for your husband during this time", "Soft yta I probably would do the same or not bother showing up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
