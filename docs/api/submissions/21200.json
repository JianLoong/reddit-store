{"id": 21200, "submission_id": "14p6jx7", "title": "AITA for leaving my friend alone in a restaurant and embarrassing her?", "selftext": "Me(24F) and C(24F) have been co workers for a couple years, over time we grew to become friends and would regularly go out to eat together either during our lunch breaks. We have done this many times before and have never had any issues prior to this day. \n\nOn this day, we decided to try a new place for lunch. After a quick google search we find a nice Mexican food spot that looks good so we agree to eat there. Lunch time rolls around and we make our way to the restaurant, get seated, etc. We usually get something quick when we go out during lunch break so we decide on some nachos to share. We order, the nachos come around, they\u2019re great, all is well. \n\nAs we are starting to polish off plate C suddenly pulls out her phone to take a photo of the nachos. I thought that was weird since they were already halfway eaten but then she points to something on the plate. She is making a disgusted face at this point so I follow the direction of her finger and notice a bay leaf that was buried under some chips. C is visibly grossed out thinking that this was a leaf from outside. I almost wanted to laugh but I didn\u2019t, because in all honesty, I had no idea what a bay leaf was or what it was used for in cooking until about a year or so prior. But before I could even try to explain, C was calling over our server. \n\nI am embarrassed at this point because I couldn\u2019t stop her in time to explain what it was before she was calling over an employee, but I thought, oh well,  the server will just explain what it is and we will all move on. This did not happen. After being explained to what she was looking at and what a bay leaf was, she continued to insist this was a leaf from outside and that she would like the nachos to be comped. Too stunned to interrupt, I continued to listen to her and the poor server go back and forth until she eventually decided to get a manager. \n\nWhen the server walked away I tried to explain to C that she was wrong, and she even began to try to argue with me. She only realized she had made a mistake when I literally pulled my phone out and googled \u201cbay leaf\u201d to show her. She seemed to be genuinely embarrassed and apologetic to ME, at least. Knowing her mistake, I assumed she would apologize to our server as well and tell them we would be happily paying for our bill, but I was shocked when the manager came over to rectify the situation and she stuck to her guns. \n\nI was mortified. Without saying a word I just excused myself to the restroom. I went and found our server and paid our bill plus a tip for her, apologized, and left out the door back to work without telling C. When C got back to work she confronted me about ditching her in the restaurant. I asked why she didn\u2019t apologize and pay for what we ordered after realizing she was wrong and she said she was embarrassed and it was easier to just follow through instead of admitting her mistake, but that I made her look like an ass by leaving her there alone and not backing her up as her friend.

She acted incredibly selfishly, albiet for a very human reason, but she sacrificed the servers' comfort for her own. That's a reaction that would make me question if her morals were so fundamentally different from my own that maybe we shouldn't be friends. There's a lot of other factors on that discussion. However, she was your friend till that moment, likely still is? Whatever she did, C deserved to be told upfront. You avoided conflict also to make yourself more comfortable, at the expense of hers.

Did her refusal to admit her mistake convince the manager that she was correct? Did she fool you? Was she less embarrassed?\n\nAsk her what, *exactly*, she thought her refusal to acknowledge her mistake accomplished. Because **she wasn't fooling anyone**, and all it accomplished was making her look even worse than she would have if she just admitted her mistake and apologized profusely before paying and leaving.\n\nI hope you'll share with her a little secret I learned many years ago:\n\n**People will remember how you handle your own mistakes.**\n\nIf, upon realizing that you were wrong or have made a mistake, you immediately front up, admit that you were/did wrong, apologize, and say what you will do to fix your mistake, people will respect that (*especially* if you do so before anyone else discovers your mistake!). What they will remember about you is that you are a person of integrity, someone who can be relied upon to make sure that you get things right, and who doesn't try to duck personal accountability. They may even, in time, forget that you screwed up.\n\nOn the other hand, if you think that you can hide what you've done wrong and get away without acknowledging your mistake, *you are wrong*. It will come out -- maybe sooner, maybe later, but it **will** come out -- and when it does come out, everyone will know that you made this mistake, and what they will remember about you is that you tried to hide it or blame someone else. They will know that you are a weasel who has no integrity and cannot be relied upon or trusted. And that negative reputation will follow you, because people will talk about it.\n\nYou handled her *faux pas* with grace and integrity, and you are NTA for leaving her there to wallow in her own stupidity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Too many folks want something for nothing, or take advantage.\n\nSo bf and I were having dinner at the nicer hotel near where we were stationed.  We both get a fried fish platter, everything\u2019s great.  Bf goes to the restroom and I\u2019m munching on crispy deliciousness, when, with slowly dawning horror, I realize there\u2019s something on my plate that looks like a batter dipped large insect with the wings out.\n\nI try not to freak out, but this is the 3rd time that week I\u2019d found bugs in my food (at a different restaurant) - the other times were a ladybug wing in my salad, and an actual crawling worm in a different salad.\n\nI wave our waitress over, point at IT and quietly ask \u2018what is THAT?!\u2019  And she had a eww! moment and takes the plate away like it\u2019s about to jump on her (so it wasn\u2019t just my imagination).  Comes back a few minutes later with my plate, all smiles, and tells me the cook said it was a shrimp tail.  I gasp out a laugh and say \u2018OF COURSE it is\u2019, it\u2019s obvious now that I know.  I thank her profusely and apologize for my active imagination.\n\nManager comes over later, apologizes for everything, offers to comp my meal and I refuse because it was a me problem and the food was delicious.  Argued with him a bit, but insisted on paying.  Bf was a little upset I wouldn\u2019t let it get comped because it was a little expensive, but it would have been WRONG.\n\nAnother time now hubby and I were at \u2018the clob\u2019 (red lobster, baby sis would call it \u2018the clobster\u2019) and when he was nearly done, I noticed that the bright design on his plate was actually old food that haven\u2019t been washed off.  But it was dry as a bone and stuck on like concrete, so it obviously had gone through the \u2018sterilizer\u2019 and hadn\u2019t gotten on his food.  We pointed it out to the waitress when she picked up our plates, saying we weren\u2019t complaining, just wanted to let her know so it could get properly cleaned (it wasn\u2019t coming off easy).\n\nYou paid on your way out back then, so on the way out the manager stops us, apologizing, etc and says he will comp our meals and tell him no, we ate the food, it was good, that it didn\u2019t affect out meal, stuff happens, we\u2019ll be back.  He insisted on giving us free deserts, which I allowed, because who turns down chocolate covered cheesecake, lol."]}
