We got pregnant with our daughter only 2 months after dating (his only biological child). Things are actually absolutely fantastic in our relationship, despite \"rushing\" in to things. There's hardly ever been issues until recently. \n\nMy son's 12th birthday is coming up soon and we had ALWAYS told him we would get him a phone for his 12th birthday. He has honestly been harping on us since he was 9 because all his friends had a phone and he felt like the odd ball out. I felt terrible and wanted to cave several times but didn't BECAUSE my husband and I already decided together that we would get him one at age 12. \n\nNow that his birthday is right around the corner he is very fixated and excited that he would be able to get a phone. He's fully expecting it, which I already knew would happen because of how many times we told him \"when you're 12\". Well, I was looking at phones online the other day that had some parental controls and all that happy jazz and my husband decided in this moment that he doesn't think my son is old enough for a phone and that he should have to wait until he's \"at least 15\". I told him that absolutely was not happening but entertained his reasoning to figure out the \"why\". He said that basically he didn't want my kid having access to ANY form of social media and he feels that getting him a phone would be forcing him to \"grow up too fast and be subjected to the media and ignorance\". I reiterated that this was the deal we had with my kid and that I wasn't going back on it. I don't even agree with his reasoning to be 100% honest with you but I didn't tell him that. I just said I wasn't going back on a promise. He argued it for easily 30 minutes, saying \"No, he doesn't even need a phone\" before I finally told him he has absolutely no say on this and I'm getting my kid a cell phone. He snaps back with \"then it had better be a fucking flip phone because I don't want him on the damn internet\". He has not spoken to me since. AITA?

It sounds like you and your husband need to have some long conversations.", "NTA 12 is old enough for a phone and he\u2019ll be ostracised socially by not having one. Also, as you said, now is not the time to revoke a 3 year promise to your child.", "NTA. You made a promise to your son, he's waited for 3 years. Breaking a promise is a bad example to set. And banning him from phones and internet in a world where most of his peer communication will be online would be harsh and isolating.", "NTA, you can limit access to kids phone and he will find a way how to get on social medie if he want to. My 7yo who have problem with reading found way how to access internet outside our home. Best way is to teach them, being aprochable when kid finds something disturbing and not to freak out on them for what they saw.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. You have been promising it to him and it will teach him to be responsible. Happy birthday to your son! Hope you get him a nice phone.", "NTA. He can give you the silent treatment all he wants.

What's your husband going to tell your kid when he's 15?  \"Wait till you're 18?\"  \n\nOn top of that, refusing to give your kid any responsiblity is a self-fulfilling endeavour that guarantees you'll have an irresponsible child.

You've checked out the parental controls so he will be safe.", "NTA  Your husband backed the promise of a phone at age 12.  Going back on that now will cause a great deal of resentment for everyone.

I get your husbands fears. Social media is a scary beast but you cannot keep your children entirely protected from it. You can have rules in place like \"the phone needs to be handed to you at a certain time at night, and no phones at meal times etc. He is still a minor so you can have plenty of rules in place to ease your husband's fears but because your son has been expecting it for so many years, to suddenly not get it will do so much damage to your relationship with him. It will not be worth the absence of a phone. Try talking to your husband by letting him know you understand his fears but that it won't be like he has free reign of the phone 24/7.", "NTA and I believe it would be wrong to change the requirements on your son now that he is expecting a phone.

That being said, assuming your husband has been the father figure to your son since he was 4 yo, you pulling the \"he is my son and I'm going to do whatever I want\" card and being dismissive makes YTA.\n\nEdit: Based on OP response, I'm switching to NTA.

Like, at what point is he \u201cdad\u201d enough to not have that mess pulled on him\u2026 shouldn\u2019t expect the guy to comprehensively assume dad obligations and responsibilities in your household if such a low blow is part of your argument arsenal.

I don\u2019t care what anyone has to say. The world is a sick place.", "It all depends on the parenting arrangement you have with the step-father.

So you're TA for playing the \"my son, not yours\" card.\n\nHe's TA, because his approach to parenting is ridiculous. Thing is, all his friends will have phones and computers, and he will have plenty of access to the \"damn internet\". It would be best for your son if you taught him to engage responsibly with the online world, rather than trying to hide it from him, and having his tutors be his teenage friends.\n\n(FWIW, that's about the age my kids got phones, because it's also when they started being more independent, and hanging out with their friends without a parent hovering over them, and having them have a phone so they can call and ask for a ride home or whatever was useful.)", "I get what your saying but at the same time once you start out with that\u2019s my kid then there will be that\u2019s not my responsibility on his part when it comes time to pay for other things.   Such as a car college", "Yta: No kid needs a phone with internet at 12, they just don\u2019t. A flip phone would work just fine.   We don\u2019t even do phones until high school.

If you teach your kid to make good decisions, they'll continue  to make them regardless of your supervision.

No parent can provide that guidance forever.\n\nMy parents were super strict when I was growing up.  One of my sisters got busted for shop lifiting as a teen, another of my sisters ended up dealing drugs in college, and I abused alcohol heavily through my first year of college.  I didn't put any kind of restrictions on my own kids, and they grew up to be total rule followers.  Neither of them even want to touch alcohol, and even the mere suggestion of doing something unethical is met with disdain.  If you let your kids learn while they're kids, they don't have to make life-changing mistakes as adults.  When everything is against the rules, then rules become meaningless.", "Their bond was a lot better when my son was younger, honestly.

Restricting access pretty much never actually improves safety or health and in turn causes kids to over indulge in the things restricted from them as children. While limited screen time(couple hours after school and more time on weekends) would definitely be a good starting ground, it\u2019s better to learn young things like online safety, responsibility of caring for something more expensive, time management on devices etc. You sound like a really great mom and good for you for sticking to your word with your kids and being honest.

Misogyny, fear of her growing up, or terrified and turning over protective, his behavior here with your son is likely about  controlling social media and phone access later for with your shared daughter", "Honor the commitment to your son for sure BUT as a long time middle school teacher, I would very seriously ask you to consider what your husband is saying in terms of internet access and social media.  Look into a Gabb phone or another type like flip or simple phone. Time and time again, the kids with the most problems in our school are the ones whose parents let them have unfettered access to internet and social media via phones at a young age. \n\nIf you do decide to give your son access to the internet and or social media, let your son know ground rules and that you plan to go through his activity / messages until he earns full trust through responsibility and action. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d full privacy at 12. Parents still need to be heavily involved in these devices to keep their kids safe. \n\nOh, and keep your eye out for hidden apps. Like apps that look like a calculator but are actually messaging apps, etc.", "Hopping onto the top comment to suggest that OP get insurance that will cover theft, damage, and \"mysterious disappearance\" on whatever phone is purchased for the child. I have a feeling insurance will save a lot of money with a man like that around the house....", "It's not just socially, my son uses his phone to communicate about school related topics. He actually doesn't communicate with his friends on it. He uses the Steam chat for that.", "It\u2019s wild that people are giving her a pass on this. It\u2019s an easy ESH here. Him for backing out of the agreement and her for this shit. \n\nI could never be with someone that says that to me 8 years in and while married. That\u2019s a quick nope from me.", "This. Ans why would she EVER agree to give a 12 year old a phone?", "If your son needs and uses a laptop for school he is already interacting with mainstream media and social media.

You've got a bigger problem than the phone. \n\nLike it wasn't about the Iranian yoghurt - you're perhaps also missing the forrest for the trees here.  \n\nSounds like your husband, lovely as he is!, is slippery sloping into conspiracy theories and hyper anxiety about bizzare stuff. \n\nMaybe for his own health and stress - HE needs to do an internet diet and cut out his own access to anger & trauma porn news stories that are written to get him scared, whipped up and upset. \n\nThis honestly sounds like he might need a therapist and support plan to detox from the rabbit holes he is going down online. \n\nYour husband is right, there is of course a risk of internet dangers. \n\nHe just doesn't realise he is already in the quicksand, and projecting onto your kid.", "It's because they're all assuming he's a crazy conservative since he \"doesn't like mainstream media\" lol. It's alarming af that she thinks 12 is an appropriate age for a phone. I'm liberal af and wouldn't dream of getting my 12 year old a smart phone. \n\nYTA", "Yeah this feels more like a power play than a legitimate desire to curtail social media. Please don\u2019t go the flip phone route.\n\nEdit: and to be clear, I\u2019m not recommending divorce, I\u2019ve been married for 27 years, have raised 5 children and am not underestimating the dangers of internet connected devices (my kids are 9-25), but a flip phone after several years of seeing all his friends get phones and finally realizing the dream is such a damn let down. Don\u2019t let your husband steal that from your son, even if it\u2019s a genuine desire to shield and not the power play I\u2019m assuming, your son will resent the hell out of that.", "Liberal parent here- many valid points to not give a 12 year old a phone- flip phone max.", "Yes it could. But you have less to say about a 15 year old than a 12 year old.. and have you been in schools? There are children with smartphones everywhere. His friends already have phones so he is probably already exposed to everything. And if you are very strict about it and forbid it then he will still do it but just not tell the parents. When there are problems he will also not tell them. Strict parents make sneaky kids. \n\nAlso if you promise something you should do that and not change the promise. This could cause major trust issues.", "I don't agree with the point about the phone. They made a deal and should honor it while also having reasonable limits on usage. 12 is a fine age for a emergency phone.  \n\n\nFirm ESH here. He doesn't get a pass taking back the agreement for the phone just because she is enforcing the awful parenting setup in their house. I say awful because what happens when they disagree on rules that would apply for both kids? Does the daughter get some compromise but the son follows whatever the mother agrees with? It's a ridiculous setup that had foreseeable problems once they had a kid together.", "I think parents should do what works for them. It\u2019s great you made your kids wait till 13/14 but that won\u2019t work for every family. We got our 10 year old a basic phone that she has to leave at home but can use it under supervision. It was cheaper than a landline and it gives her time to learn responsibilities. When she goes to middle school next year she will be allowed to take it with her and will have restrictions on usage. The main reason being that the bus stop is 1/2 mile walk at 6:30am and 1/2 mile walk home at 2:30pm unless she has after school activities. I\u2019m just not comfortable with her walking that far that early without some sort of tracker/communication, and getting home before we are off work.", "Then he's welcome to sign you all up for an internet safety class", "NTA Like it or not, kids today have phones and get on social media a lot younger than 15.", "NTA\u2026 \u201cyou can\u2019t change the rules just cause you don\u2019t like how I\u2019m doin it\u201d", "NTA-Learning from friends is worse than the internet.

The agreement was that your kid can get a PHONE, not social media.", "He'd probably move the goal post again at 15. \n\nNTA, you don't want to go back on your word and affect your son's trust.

He's old enough to be walking and biking places with friends, catching rides without checking with you, and before too long he'll have friends who drive. Being able to at least text you whats up keeps him safe while still giving him independence. You're husband's thoughts on social media also don't seem very well informed- he wants the abstinence only sex ed version, which doesn't actually give your kid the tools he needs to be successful as an adult or even older teen.
