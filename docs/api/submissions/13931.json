We got pregnant with our daughter only 2 months after dating (his only biological child). Things are actually absolutely fantastic in our relationship, despite \"rushing\" in to things. There's hardly ever been issues until recently. \n\nMy son's 12th birthday is coming up soon and we had ALWAYS told him we would get him a phone for his 12th birthday. He has honestly been harping on us since he was 9 because all his friends had a phone and he felt like the odd ball out. I felt terrible and wanted to cave several times but didn't BECAUSE my husband and I already decided together that we would get him one at age 12. \n\nNow that his birthday is right around the corner he is very fixated and excited that he would be able to get a phone. He's fully expecting it, which I already knew would happen because of how many times we told him \"when you're 12\". Well, I was looking at phones online the other day that had some parental controls and all that happy jazz and my husband decided in this moment that he doesn't think my son is old enough for a phone and that he should have to wait until he's \"at least 15\". I told him that absolutely was not happening but entertained his reasoning to figure out the \"why\". He said that basically he didn't want my kid having access to ANY form of social media and he feels that getting him a phone would be forcing him to \"grow up too fast and be subjected to the media and ignorance\". I reiterated that this was the deal we had with my kid and that I wasn't going back on it. I don't even agree with his reasoning to be 100% honest with you but I didn't tell him that. I just said I wasn't going back on a promise. He argued it for easily 30 minutes, saying \"No, he doesn't even need a phone\" before I finally told him he has absolutely no say on this and I'm getting my kid a cell phone. He snaps back with \"then it had better be a fucking flip phone because I don't want him on the damn internet\". He has not spoken to me since. AITA?

It sounds like you and your husband need to have some long conversations.", "NTA 12 is old enough for a phone and he\u2019ll be ostracised socially by not having one. Also, as you said, now is not the time to revoke a 3 year promise to your child.", "NTA. You made a promise to your son, he's waited for 3 years. Breaking a promise is a bad example to set. And banning him from phones and internet in a world where most of his peer communication will be online would be harsh and isolating.", "NTA, you can limit access to kids phone and he will find a way how to get on social medie if he want to. My 7yo who have problem with reading found way how to access internet outside our home. Best way is to teach them, being aprochable when kid finds something disturbing and not to freak out on them for what they saw.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. You have been promising it to him and it will teach him to be responsible. Happy birthday to your son! Hope you get him a nice phone.", "NTA. He can give you the silent treatment all he wants.

What's your husband going to tell your kid when he's 15?  \"Wait till you're 18?\"  \n\nOn top of that, refusing to give your kid any responsiblity is a self-fulfilling endeavour that guarantees you'll have an irresponsible child.

You've checked out the parental controls so he will be safe.", "NTA  Your husband backed the promise of a phone at age 12.  Going back on that now will cause a great deal of resentment for everyone.

Also, just sitting down and having a lengthy discussion with your son regarding how toxic social media can be, and the dos-and-don'ts of having a smartphone, is very imperative. \n\nYou and your husband need to have a long discussion regarding rules with this phone and how you'll tackle this as a *team*.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds controlling and irrational.

I get your husbands fears. Social media is a scary beast but you cannot keep your children entirely protected from it. You can have rules in place like \"the phone needs to be handed to you at a certain time at night, and no phones at meal times etc. He is still a minor so you can have plenty of rules in place to ease your husband's fears but because your son has been expecting it for so many years, to suddenly not get it will do so much damage to your relationship with him. It will not be worth the absence of a phone. Try talking to your husband by letting him know you understand his fears but that it won't be like he has free reign of the phone 24/7.", "NTA and I believe it would be wrong to change the requirements on your son now that he is expecting a phone.

That being said, assuming your husband has been the father figure to your son since he was 4 yo, you pulling the \"he is my son and I'm going to do whatever I want\" card and being dismissive makes YTA.\n\nEdit: Based on OP response, I'm switching to NTA.

Like, at what point is he \u201cdad\u201d enough to not have that mess pulled on him\u2026 shouldn\u2019t expect the guy to comprehensively assume dad obligations and responsibilities in your household if such a low blow is part of your argument arsenal.

I don\u2019t care what anyone has to say. The world is a sick place.", "It all depends on the parenting arrangement you have with the step-father.

So you're TA for playing the \"my son, not yours\" card.\n\nHe's TA, because his approach to parenting is ridiculous. Thing is, all his friends will have phones and computers, and he will have plenty of access to the \"damn internet\". It would be best for your son if you taught him to engage responsibly with the online world, rather than trying to hide it from him, and having his tutors be his teenage friends.\n\n(FWIW, that's about the age my kids got phones, because it's also when they started being more independent, and hanging out with their friends without a parent hovering over them, and having them have a phone so they can call and ask for a ride home or whatever was useful.)", "I get what your saying but at the same time once you start out with that\u2019s my kid then there will be that\u2019s not my responsibility on his part when it comes time to pay for other things.   Such as a car college", "Yta: No kid needs a phone with internet at 12, they just don\u2019t. A flip phone would work just fine.   We don\u2019t even do phones until high school.

If you teach your kid to make good decisions, they'll continue  to make them regardless of your supervision.  If you're constantly forcing good decisions on them, they'll eventually find themselves in a position where they're unable to make good decisions without your guidance.  No parent can provide that guidance forever.\n\nMy parents were super strict when I was growing up.  One of my sisters got busted for shop lifiting as a teen, another of my sisters ended up dealing drugs in college, and I abused alcohol heavily through my first year of college.  I didn't put any kind of restrictions on my own kids, and they grew up to be total rule followers.  Neither of them even want to touch alcohol, and even the mere suggestion of doing something unethical is met with disdain.  If you let your kids learn while they're kids, they don't have to make life-changing mistakes as adults.  When everything is against the rules, then rules become meaningless.", "Their bond was a lot better when my son was younger, honestly. I mean, my son hugs him good night and they sometimes rough house but for the most part, both my son and my husband are off playing video games and don't speak to each other. It's not a tense relationship by any means but not an overly involved dad/son type of thing.", "NTA.  I co-parent.  I believe a phone is pretty much a necessity by jh in today's world.  I fully understand not  everyone agrees with me.  But, especially w/o landlines, I feel it is a safety issue.  I had to make this one of our non-negotiables w/ my co-parent who leans to being kinda \"low tech\".", "As an fyi, OP gave out some more info on her son's relationship with her husband in the comments. The son's bio father is very much actively in his life- the husband has been around almost his whole life but is definitely seems to not be treated or seen as his father.", "That would actually be perfect. Does it still have normal calling and texting capabilities? He mainly wants it for texting his friends and music.", "My son's father takes him every other week and is very involved even when it isn't \"his week\". My husband never assumed the father position over my son. There was a bond there when he was younger but as my son gets older, the interactions become far less frequent. A part of me feels like he doesn't want my son having a phone because our daughter is now asking for one (she's far too young) and I have a feeling he might think it's unfair.", "She's too young to have a phone, it's not healthy at all but I guess you know better", "He doesn't act like a father, I wouldn't say. My son hugs him goodnight and they rough house occasionally but they don't really talk or interact much because they are always too busy with their video games. He never adopted him. My son calls him by his real name. But again, there's not much of a bond there. Not like there used to be anyways.", "OP said her sons dad is very involved in his life and sounds like it\u2019s a 50/50 custody split.  She also said her husband doesn\u2019t discipline or anything but just enforces the rules she has set like bedtime.  She also commented on their relationship and doesn\u2019t sound like her husband is a parent, more of a moms husband type relationship and they don\u2019t seem to do much together.   So I completely think she\u2019s NTA and he\u2019s just being a dick to her son.  You don\u2019t promise someone something for 3 years then take it back at the 11th hour.  The son will hold onto that resentment.  \nBut she needs to have a serious talk with him as he can\u2019t be that stupid to think a 12 year old isn\u2019t on the \u201cdamn internet\u201d already.   School project now require internet research so not sure his idea of no internet is even reality at this point.", "Well he isn't his son. He isn't the boys parent. Those are facts of life.", "Your son is almost 12 which is 100% the appropriate time to be teaching him about internet safety and proper device handling, if he isn\u2019t online himself now, he\u2019s exposed to the same content from his friends at school and being able to teach him how to be safe and monitor him helps keep him safe, and it also means he won\u2019t be afraid to come to you if something happens to him. Restricting access pretty much never actually improves safety or health and in turn causes kids to over indulge in the things restricted from them as children. While limited screen time(couple hours after school and more time on weekends) would definitely be a good starting ground, it\u2019s better to learn young things like online safety, responsibility of caring for something more expensive, time management on devices etc. You sound like a really great mom and good for you for sticking to your word with your kids and being honest. I\u2019m glad your son has you for an advocate and I hope this works out well for you. :)", "Yeeeah, I think this issue is not about a phone and is going to be more of a thing the older your son gets. Your husband is afraid because he knows the more your son is exposed to the actual world the more chance he has of realising that perhaps his (your husbands) views on certain things might actually be incorrect.", "My friend. Take your kids and RUN. NTA but please reevaluate your relationship. Move funds to a secure account. Make sure that you have all of your documents in a safe place. And please make sure that he\u2019s not feeding your children bs behind your back (although I\u2019m willing to make a bet that he\u2019s not lifting a finger when it comes to taking care of both your home and the kids..)\nSeriously run", "Oh, I also missed that you'd already discussed it... definatly NTA. Why did he change his mind? That's so strange...", "If son is playing video games, I guessing with friends? Are friends physically there? If not, he is already online", "Ah my bad for assuming", "don't do this, by the way. your son is young but he's not an idiot. you know very well what he is looking for when he asks for a phone (and by extension, what you have promised him!), and you know very well it isn't some half measure \"only text mom and dad\" phone. giving him some hamstrung device to appeal to your husband's bullshit will not go over well with your son.", "You want him to be able to have access to the internet, but learn how to be safe. Learning how to manage social media is now part of growing up. Guide him through this time. Get him a smart phone and teach him to be smart online.", "This might be a bit of a controversial opinion, but I think it would be better if he had some (probably moderated) access to the internet. Yes there are always some risks, but that's where careful parenting comes in, and teaching him how to browse and use these resources safely. If you try to keep him from these things completely, he'll probably still end up exposed to certain things through friends and classmates, only without your guidance. The internet is a powerful tool nowadays, try not to deprive your son of it completely.", "Even if you get him an old iPhone with a talk and text plan he should be okay, you can make sure apps can\u2019t be downloaded without your permission and your son will have access to modern apps and games his friends probably have, you can also connect it to another device and backup texts if you are worried about what he\u2019s doing on his phone. A lot of schools and teachers also have adapted to getting kids to use their phones more in class whether it\u2019s for games or research so having some internet capability would be good without giving him access to data and most schools already have social media and inappropriate websites blocked on school wifi", "> My son's father takes him every other week and is very involved even when it isn't \"his week\".\n\nOk, I'll update and say NTA. I recommend this being your reason right here. Your son needs a cell phone because on the weeks that he spends with his father you want to be sure he has a way to reach you. Period.", "\"When you're 12\" is an easy line to hold. \n\n\"Your brother got one when he was 12. You can have one when you're 12.\" No unfairness there.", "Definitely NTA.", "Does the birth father provide any parenting?  Does the step-father take actions such as telling him when to go to bed, discipline, or similar?", "He is raising the kid, so he should have a say on how to discipline him. Just because he is not the biological father, it doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t count! Having said that, he is definitely wrong for backtracking on something that had been previously agreed on, and the child is anxiously looking forward to. That is how trust issues begin.", "Wtf is wrong with you? \n\nThe only info you have here is that he\u2019s disagreed with OP on his step kid having a mobile phone at 12 years old and he dislikes the mainstream media, and you\u2019re suggesting OP runaway with their child, embezzle marital assets and divorce him? \n\nOP is NTA and I agree with her completely, but you have a completely deranged view of relationships if this is your advice.", "He says he changed his mind because he doesn't want my son having any access to the internet and mainstream media. He said it would be damaging to my son.", "My son's father has him every other week and is very involved even on weeks that aren't \"his weeks\". My husband doesn't enforce any discipline. He does however enforce rules that I have already put in place (such as bedtime).", "He\u2019s not raising the kid. Op and her ex are raising the kid. He has two parents who are very involved in his life. While her husband does get an opinion, that\u2019s all he can get. An opinion. If both of his active parents say he can have a phone then so be it.", "Sounds like right-wing nonsense\u2026is he worried your son would realize how close-minded his stepdad is?", "I'm sure he's on the internet when he's wrh his friends  looking at their phones \n\nNTA", "Well it might be. Social media can be viscious. The news is violent. There is a lot of \"fake news\" about (or so we have been told...) \n\nBut not having access to the internet is also damaging. Being left out of a huge part of modern life won't do him any favours as he enters highschool. You sould like you are doing the right thing and making sure you can use parental controls. Good luck, I hope you two can resolve this.", "I feel like he knew that he already change his mind and was waiting to say something to the last minute", "Great point for guys who don\u2019t want to be bothered with women with kids from previous relationships. You\u2019re going to deal with the responsibilities, but whenever a disagreement or difference of opinions arise, they can claim \u201cyour not the parent, so shut up!\u201d. Meanwhile, you still have to live with the kid. As I said, everybody sucks in this. The stepdad for being unreasonable and backpedaling on the phone, and the mother for dismissing his opinion just because he is not the bio father. You can\u2019t expect someone to take responsibility for you and your kid and then disregard their contribution and opinion.", ">Sounds like right-wing nonsense\u2026is he worried your son would realize how close-minded his stepdad is?\n\nDing ding ding", "I don\u2019t see what\u2019s inherently right wing about this lol. There\u2019s mainstream news publications that swing heavily left (CNN, MSNBC) and heavily right (Fox News, New York post) and there\u2019s nothing wrong with being sceptical about news sources. \u2018Fake news\u2019 has been a term used heavily by both ends of the political spectrum for years now.\n\nThere\u2019s also nothing inherently wrong with being \u2018right wing\u2019, just as there\u2019s nothing wrong with being \u2018left wing\u2019. \n\nHowever OP is NTA and it does sound like the husband is being overly paranoid about this instead of trying to teach the child about critical thinking.", "There's obviously a lot of fake news around. Read the same story on cnn, msnbc, bbc, fox, cgtn, rt, and tass. Tell me which one is real?", "She\u2019s not expecting him to take responsibility for anything? She is a grown adult perfectly capable of being responsible for herself and her son has two active parents who take responsibility for him. He is his wife\u2019s husband, not the kids dad. Like I said, he can have an opinion but he can\u2019t make decisions just because. He can go to her and tell her his reservations but at the end of the day, the only person who can tell her no on this is the kids bio dad. Step dad doesn\u2019t get a say."]}
