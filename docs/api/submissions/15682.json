Your husband knows about your medical issue, why didn\u2019t he tell you he was putting food on? But how did the pizza catch fire? He either put it on way too hot or was taking a long ass shower.\n\nThat smoke alarm needs fixing ASAP- without your sense of smell, you are in danger in an electrical fire or similar emergencies. And your husband needs to work on communication... that or he is just trying to shift the blame so he doesn't look so dumb.", "NTA\n\nMy teenaged kid already knows that if he puts something in the oven, HE's responsible for monitoring it. Your husband is being more of an asshole than my 16yo son is.", "You cannot just expect people to do things at a random and not let them know anything. Like oh, let me leave and get mad at you for my own mistake. The thing that really puts the cherry on top is that you have anosmia and he realizes you can't smell the food. He didn't tell you and gets mad because you didn't watch it when you weren't aware of it??? \n\nNTA", "NTA, the oven has a timer built into it usually and if not his phone definitely does, the box tells you how long to cook it.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband doesn\u2019t want to take ownership for his own fuck up.\n\nIf having your pizza not burn is important to you, you take steps to prevent it from burning .\n\nHe didn\u2019t. Ergo charcoal pizza.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm deaf and my wife knows this so she tells me when to check on any food if she needs me to as I won't hear a timer. If she doesn't tell me about it and I don't hear the timer, that's 100% not on me", "Easy NTA.  He put the food in and apparently didn't set a timer and then left the area.  100% his fault.", "NTA - He's got some nerve putting your life in danger and then trying to blame you for it. He could have burned the house down with that stunt and you would have been left wondering wth happened if you survived. His phone call is no excuse for his inattention to a potential fire hazard that ended up being an actual fire. Your medical condition makes it an especially egregious error, as someone without the condition would be able to tell what's happening while you have no idea. He should have apologized to you instead of blaming you since he knew he didn't tell you and you had no other way to know.", "NTA.  He's just mad at the loss of delicious pizza and is taking it out on you", "A) he should have staying in the room  \nB) he should have set a timer   \nC) he should have asked you to watch it for him \n\nThere were multiple avenues open to him to not screw this up, and yet.

He takes 100% of the AH points.", "NTA. He should have known exactly how long the pizza took to cook. It's up to him to make sure he doesn't Jack off in the shower because no way a grown man takes that long to shower without giving it a tug.", "NTA You need to send him to the couch until he owns up to his shit. He didn't tell you he had pizza in the over, you can't smell, he knows you can't smell, and in all probability he chose to do an...ahem!, self-pleasuring activity while in the shower which is why he lost track of his pizza. He was 110% at fault and YOU need to have him own up to it.", "NTA. You know your husband is at fault. You're not a telepath.", "NTA, he put a pizza and then went and showered, he acted like an idiot and shouldn\u2019t blame you for that choice", "NTA. You were not aware he was cooking something, weren't asked to watch it, and have a solid medical reason why you couldn't tell anything was wrong. Not your fault in the slightest.\n\nYour husband on the other hand... even if he was upset at himself and projecting, that was an asshole move. He didn't set a timer, he left the room, he didn't ask you to watch it well he jumped in the shower. This was clearly his fault. If this is a one time thing, discuss it with him and let it go. If this is a pattern, then you have larger problems that will likely need either a therapist or a lawyer.", "It was the grill and the pizza was on a tray with baking paper on it which caught fire.\n\nHe was distracted by a phone call so that's why he didn't put the timer on or tell me.\n\nHe forgot I can't smell as it's not something you remember unless it involves smelling something.\n\nEdit: new smoke alarm has been fitted.", "Anyone who leaves a stove on with no off timer and goes to another room is negligent.", "He does love pizza...", "Exactly. One time I asked my roommate if he could keep an ear out for water boiling on the stove while I did something in the other room. I was making ramen, but HE thought I was using the tea kettle and he should be listening for whistling, not the sound of a boil. So when I heard, \"YOU ALMOST SET THE STOVE ON FIRE!\" bellowed at me and he told me he was listening for the kettle, it was ON ME and I owned it. I wasn't clear.", "It does have a timer but he forgot to set it as he was on the phone.", "Why would she be at all to blame?\n\nShe can\u2019t smell and he didn\u2019t tell her he put something in so she knew to keep an eye on it.", "What? He put something with parchment paper on it ON THE GRILL?\n\nYou're not supposed to use parchment paper on the grill. Because it catches fire.", "So he wasn't doing it properly (as another commenter mentioned, you shouldn't use baking paper on the grill), he forgot about his wife's disability (would he have forgotten I'd you were deprived of another sense?)\n\nHe took a phone call when he knew he should be concentrated on not burning the place down (because of the aforementioned paper on the grill).\n\nThen he blames you for it... but I cannot see an action here where he wasn't at fault.", "Does he often blame you for things that aren't your fault?", "i have a rotten sense of smell too, but put that aside. Why would you rely on someone smelling the cooking to keep an eye on it, they most likely wouldn't smell it until it was burning. If it needed care he needed to ask", "So does my 16yo, which is why he knows he's responsible for cooking his own. And responsible if he gets distracted and lets it burn.", "Sounds like whatever was on his phone was more important to him than eating dinner.", "Yeah this is entirely his own fault.", "All his fault. He's projecting onto you.", "He made a lot of mistakes. Used parchment paper, didn\u2019t set timer, didn\u2019t let you know, hopped in the shower. All his mistakes. You did nothing wrong. Frankly I\u2019d be annoyed he lot only made multiple mistakes and caused a fire, he then turned around and blames YOU for something completely out of your control. That\u2019s worrying.", "Sounds like this was all your fault yet he was blaming you!   NTA", "Grill is what UK people call the broiler (US)", "It was, job offer.", "Are we talking about the top broiler like a US oven has? You're still not supposed to use parchment paper when that's on either.", "yes, the top part of the oven is what we call a grill.", "NTA he didn't use the broiler correctly. You can't leave it like that.", "NTA he put the food in the oven, he is responsible for making sure it cooks safely. Especially since he didn\u2019t even bother to let you know, and knows that you have no sense of smell.", "God, how simple.  Not the asshole.  Who puts a pizza in the oven, then takes a shower?", "NTA - hubby should be monitoring his own food instead of expecting you to do it.", "Nta. If i burn something I would be mad at my self. Not other people. My aunt is like that and it's really annoying.", "No, that\u2019s something important he doesn\u2019t get to forget. You\u2019re married and he doesn\u2019t care to remember a massive detail that could potentially kill you both?", "In Canada that's the burner", "The heating element at the top of the interior of the oven. In the US we call it the broiler. The external heating elements on the top of the oven, where you'd boil water or cook something in a skillet are the burners here."]}
