One time I asked my roommate if he could keep an ear out for water boiling on the stove while I did something in the other room.

How about you being unable to detect a gas leak(Because you can't smell the chemicals they add just for this reason--to smell when there's a leak)?", "NTA, how can you watch if you do not know about it. Also, he is a danger in the kitchen for leaving something in the oven that is done in such a short time.", "OP said that the husband received a phone call regarding a job offer after his shower, which is why he didn\u2019t put on a timer or come back in time.  Just to add some context. He still fucked up, but it sounds like OP left out some context about why the husband got distracted. NTA btw", "Oh hun, no. My mother has had no sense of smell for 10 years. When I'm with her and I smell something \"wrong\" I always mention it because I know she can't smell it. If anyone is cooking at her place, they always use the timer. It takes 2 seconds to set. Because we all know she can't smell, we don't \"forget\".\n\nForget whether or not you can smell.

Still not an excuse, but at least an explanation)", "I also can't smell, and everyone in my environment always forgets because it's an invisible disability.\n\nHaving no sense of smell is not life threatening except in extraordinary cases like this one. The husband is still the ass for being angry after wife reminded him.", "> Now he\u2019s pissed that his pizza is inedible \n\nNotice how OP didn\u2019t say he was pissed at her? He\u2019s pissed he ruined his pizza. The way it\u2019s written indicates he didn\u2019t yell or blame her after the initial shock and upset at the situation. \n\nAlso, this is written in present tense indicating stress is still high. The context is important because it sounds like he\u2019s frustrated at himself for getting distracted and causing a house fire. He initially yelled because he was scared and confused. Yelling in response to a stressful situation to figure out what happened doesn\u2019t make him a \u201craging dick\u201d or an AH. He would be though if he continued to blame or yell at her, but  OP commented that this behavior is not normal for him at all. It wasn\u2019t indicated he continued to do this beyond the first time either. \n\nBut, I\u2019m coming from a perspective where I have ADHD and a partner, friends, and family members with ADHD. So, distractions and honest mistakes and misunderstanding are not unusual. It\u2019s stressful and chaotic, and later, it\u2019s funny and embarrassing. If I was the husband, l would not react calmly to a kitchen fire, and I would also be upset once I realized how badly I fucked up lol. \n\nOP, you are not NTA because how can you be an AH for something you didn\u2019t even know about? It\u2019s not your fault, OP, and be happy you saw the smoke before the situation worsened.

Nothing to do with you.", "NTA, I\u2019m anosmic too and I often find other people don\u2019t actually understand that one, we can\u2019t smell anything at all, but more than that we don\u2019t then have the same thought process as they do. They\u2019re always reminded of the food they\u2019re cooking because they can smell it even from rooms away. However unless someone physically tells me or asks me to watch something cooking I have no idea it\u2019s happening unless I actually get up, go to the kitchen and notice there\u2019s something in the oven. The lack of scent means we don\u2019t get these prompts, it\u2019s all visual and sound, and a pizza cooking is mostly silent. \n\nMy partner and I have similar disagreements about our cat litter tray, unless I actually dig around or look closely I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s gone or not, and not being able to smell it means some of the time I can just forget about it.", "NTA- I lost my sense of smell for a year and a half thanks to COVID.
