Maybe send a text next time and give him a heads up that your daughter asked for a home packed lunch and you\u2019d be happy to take care of it. Based on the reactions though, it sounds like he\u2019s going to find fault with whatever you do.", "NTA. And anyone else saying Y T A forgets that the most important person in this situation is your daughter. I am a child mental health therapist and the damage it causes for children to have their parents happiness placed over their own can be significant.", "NTA especially if you live in the US. Our cafeteria food is nutritionally poor and disgusting. I was blown away seeing what cafeteria lunches in other countries looked like, our school lunches look little better than prison food.", "INFO: Do you have a strained relationship with your ex usually or was him thinking you are insufferable unusual?  Do you usually skip trying to communicate directly with him?", "NTA. \u201cNone of your damn business\u201d = \u201cI\u2019m too lazy to do it, but I know that answer won\u2019t hold up at the custody hearing\u201d. Keep feeding your child and if he has a problem with it then offer to let the judge decide. I guarantee it won\u2019t be with him.", "NTA, and he sounds like a seriously controlling AH.\n\nYou wanted to be sure your daughter had lunch. That's being a good parent, especially when she expressed she didn't like the cafeteria.\n\nHe needs to stop playing immature passive aggressive games that involve your kid.", "NTA- coming from a child of divorce it is truly not that big of a deal. both of my parents would send me money for lunch or bring me lunch if i asked. it\u2019s probably a power trip for him i know it always was for my parents \n\ndon\u2019t let anyone make you feel like an AH bc u gave your daughter something she needed. school lunch is also super unhealthy and full of shit kids shouldn\u2019t eat lol", "NTA and it\u2019s definitely not parental alienation. You are still her mother even when it\u2019s \u201chis days\u201d.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nYour daughter is right that most cafeteria food is gross, minus the grilled cheese as in my high school that stuff was the best lol I don't blame you for bringing her in lunch.\r  \n\r  \nHow old is she though? Can she make her own lunch? My 11 year old (grade 6) has been making her own lunch for years now. She likes having \"control\" over what she packs, obviously I buy the food so it's not like she's putting junk in there. I help out when need be of course.\r  \n\r  \nYour ex sounds very controlling and he's pissed as you made him look bad.", "NTA. He\u2019s trying to punish you but he\u2019s hurting his daughter.

And she said she doesn't like cafeteria food, so there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nA fucking 7 year old preparing her own lunch. I seriously hope and I pray to God all y'all who are saying she's an asshole don't have a kid! 7 year old?! Lol, y'all are terrible parentals except for OP!", "Based on what you wrote, NTA but how old is your daughter? Could she make her own lunch? Maybe your ex has a lot on his plate right now and the saved time is worth $3/day to him. It\u2019s also possible that your daughter didn\u2019t tell her dad that she doesn\u2019t like the school food.", "**YTA**\n\nWhile he's technically wrong that this is parental alienation, he is still just using the wrong verbiage to express the correct sentiment that you are interfering in his custodial time - and arguably, in a manner meant to make you the \"preferred parent\", who shows up at your child's beck and call as soon as her other parent does something that makes her the least bit unhappy . . . which isn't parental alienation, but isn't something entirely off-base from that either.\n\nWhat happens during his custodial time, as long as it isn't harmful to her, is not for you to interfere with, and CERTAINLY not for you to \"make up for\" during that time by riding to the rescue with request fulfilments, without even discussing it with him. In fact, what's fundamentally lacking here is communication. And you're not actually helping your child by encouraging her not to communicate with her dad about any issues she may be having whilst under his roof. In fact, encouraging her to come to you while it is his custodial time to \"fix what your daddy's doing wrong\" instead of talking to him about it so they can come to an understanding IS definitively a form of parental alienation, and you might want to think about the message you're sending her.\n\nIf your daughter hates cafeteria food, she needs to have a conversation with her father about that, about why he has started sending her with lunch money, and about what alternatives they can come up with. If he is overwhelmed with work and too busy to make lunches perhaps she would like to start making her own lunches (you can help her make a list of what groceries she will need for her favourite sandwiches or whatever she usually takes from your house). But this is something for THEM to discuss, not for you to involve yourself with . . . at least not without talking to him first. This is HIS parenting time, not yours. Let him parent; encourage her to communicate with her father if she is unhappy. YTA for racing in to fix something on his time.", "NTA - Sounds like he is just lashing out cause he feels like his authority is being threatened by your actions.", "NTA, you made him look bad.", "NTA, though if this continues with him not giving his daughter a packed lunch, and you bringing her lunch...\n\nThat is something you could definitely use at any future court hearings to make him look bad.\n\nI feel like he knows this, but thinks he can just trick you into not doing it?  Rather then packing her a packed lunch.", "So, instead of talking to him about it on Saturday (when she went over to her dad's) you wait until it's Monday to bring her lunch? You knew about it Wednesday when she came to your house. Why didn't you just simply talk to her dad at drop off instead? This whole thing could have been handled easily by communicating. \n\nI can see why you brought her lunch. You want her to have what she wants. I can also see why her dad is upset. You failed to talk to him about the lunch thing when you had plenty of time to do so. You acted on what you wanted to do instead of talking to him about things. Coparenting can be hard, but you have to communicate with each other. \n\nESH", "Are you going to drop off dinner and breakfast at his house too if she says she doesn\u2019t like it?", "NTA...\n\nBut also, kids are notorious for pitting parents against each other.  Are you sure that she didn't tell your ex that kids don't pack anymore?  And then telling you that her dad doesn't pack her a lunch anymore?\n\nThere's way more to this story.", "YTA. During his time, it's up to him to manage her food.  If she doesn't like it, she should take it up with him first.  If she's still not satisfied, she could take it up with you and you could act like a co-parent and discuss it with him.  Instead, you went behind his back and played the hero.", "YTA. Would you like him overriding your choices during your parenting time? I am sure she can find something she will eat at school if she doesn\u2019t bring a packed lunch or she could take responsibility for her own lunch and pack one for herself if the schools food is unacceptable. His house, his time, his choice just like it is when she is with you.", "I'm gonna say YTA for not talking to him about it first. And before everyone jumps and says when OP did tell him, his reaction was shitty - well yeah of course it was. OP already overrode his choice without saying anything. Not cool.", "ESH. He has a right to give her lunch money on his days but if she has asked for a packed lunch or verbalized not liking the school lunch then why not make her lunch the night before and keep it consistent? It\u2019s not rocket science.\n\nThat said, OP should\u2019ve talked to dad about this first instead of making him feel undermined on his day. What\u2019s so hard about a message ahead of time regarding the lunches? You already have a highly tense relationship and should\u2019ve known this would add to it with your child firmly placed in the middle of these petty disputes.", "Okay, so I have to say a slight YTA. Yes, it is still his custody time with her so he is responsible for her meals and his choice to make her lunches. But you do need to talk to your ex and see why he has stopped making her lunch. It may be he got a pay cut or he doesn't have time to make her lunch. Like one person said, she can learn how to be responsible if she makes her own lunch the night before school. If it is a money issue, then offer to buy what your daughter needs so it can be put in a special place in your ex's fridge and make sure you let him know you aren't doing that to make him feel less of a parent, you're just helping your daughter and taking stress off of him", "ESH. It just smells like a reason to have a disagreement. I once had a coworker with kids that age who beg to do something at her house, then go home to their dad and complain about it (sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room.) The kids caused constant arguments between their parents over crap like that, apparently just for the fun of it. \n\nMaybe that isn't exactly what is going on here, but neither parent should butt in on the other's days over something so petty.

I don\u2019t think there is enough info to say if either is the asshole. Why did dad stop making the lunches?  Why didn\u2019t mom discuss this with dad before dropping off lunch?  Kids will use situations like this to pit their parents against each other and if they have 50/50 then they need to coparent better than this. I do family law and have had cases where the noncustodial parent drops off fast food lunches for the child - it causes huge problems.", "Making a list of groceries for dad isn't overstepping bounds?

If you were lucky there was enough heat left in the toast for the cheese to kinda stick to the bread.", "Understandable.  These things are complicated and difficult and if communication is a problem then I have a better understanding of your actions.  I will say that I can understand how he could feel like you're just trying to swoop in and be the \"good parent\" but it wasn't helpful for him to lash out instead of explaining.  Equally, it would have been good if you had said that your daughter didn't like the school lunches and was trying to make sure she'd actually eat and thought it was easier for everyone this way instead of jumping to asking him why he stopped making lunches.  It's possible there's a reason he needed to do it for a time.  It's also equally possible that he's just being lazy.  Too hard to tell, and if your communication is that bad then it may be impossible to ever really know.  I'm going to lean toward a soft ESH but with the caveat that I understand this is a difficult situation.  But for your daughter's sake, sometimes pushing for the information from him first in a way that isn't delivered to him in an accusing way is the way to go.  Trying to be diplomatic, you know?  I feel for you and I hope it gets easier.", "Info: does your ex have a refrigerator in his home?", "7 is kind of too young for that responsibility. This needs to be something you discuss with dad.

She could help by grabbing sides like a piece of fruit and some pretzels or similar, if they\u2019re available to her. But yeah, maybe a chat with the ex would have been a better move than just deciding to start making lunch on \u201chis\u201d days.", "Then she can make it the night before if she really wants a lunch.

Should mom be providing groceries when she\u2019s at dad\u2019s house?", "Yeah, that's a lot to throw onto the shoulders of a 7-year-old, but that's divorce for you - courts saying it's no longer your kid when it's not your day, and there's nothing you can do about it.", "My point is what if she doesn\u2019t like the food at breakfast or dinner and says it\u2019s disgusting? What will you do?", "Sure she can, but how would she feel if the roles were reversed and during her time dad decided to show up with a happy meal and her lovingly packed lunch goes uneaten because dad brought her something she liked more. \n\nCoparenting requires communication, compromise,and to certain extent letting go. You don\u2019t get to control the house rules, schedule, food options at the other parents house.", "Would you feel the same if she was dropping off food at his house?", "If he wants to drop of breakfast or dinner, he can.

She definitely wouldn't eat McDonald's.", "There's a huge difference between a \"lovingly packed lunch\" and cafeteria food.

Not really you are forcing the child to make a choice between what one parent provided vice the other parent provided.\n\nCorrect she can provide lunch, but should she be? At some point she has to learn to coparent with him and accept that he doesn\u2019t do something the same way she does and that is okay as long as it isn\u2019t harming her.", "The kid is 7 lol. If she was a bit older yeah she should, but I would at least help start teaching her and guiding her on how to \"meal prep\".
