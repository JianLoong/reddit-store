I am a child mental health therapist and the damage it causes for children to have their parents happiness placed over their own can be significant.", "NTA especially if you live in the US.

Keep feeding your child and if he has a problem with it then offer to let the judge decide. I guarantee it won\u2019t be with him.", "NTA, and he sounds like a seriously controlling AH.\n\nYou wanted to be sure your daughter had lunch. That's being a good parent, especially when she expressed she didn't like the cafeteria.\n\nHe needs to stop playing immature passive aggressive games that involve your kid.", "NTA- coming from a child of divorce it is truly not that big of a deal. both of my parents would send me money for lunch or bring me lunch if i asked. it\u2019s probably a power trip for him i know it always was for my parents \n\ndon\u2019t let anyone make you feel like an AH bc u gave your daughter something she needed. school lunch is also super unhealthy and full of shit kids shouldn\u2019t eat lol", "NTA and it\u2019s definitely not parental alienation.

Can she make her own lunch? My 11 year old (grade 6) has been making her own lunch for years now.

I seriously hope and I pray to God all y'all who are saying she's an asshole don't have a kid! 7 year old?! Lol, y'all are terrible parentals except for OP!", "Based on what you wrote, NTA but how old is your daughter? Could she make her own lunch? Maybe your ex has a lot on his plate right now and the saved time is worth $3/day to him. It\u2019s also possible that your daughter didn\u2019t tell her dad that she doesn\u2019t like the school food.", "**YTA**\n\nWhile he's technically wrong that this is parental alienation, he is still just using the wrong verbiage to express the correct sentiment that you are interfering in his custodial time - and arguably, in a manner meant to make you the \"preferred parent\", who shows up at your child's beck and call as soon as her other parent does something that makes her the least bit unhappy . . . which isn't parental alienation, but isn't something entirely off-base from that either.\n\nWhat happens during his custodial time, as long as it isn't harmful to her, is not for you to interfere with, and CERTAINLY not for you to \"make up for\" during that time by riding to the rescue with request fulfilments, without even discussing it with him. In fact, what's fundamentally lacking here is communication. And you're not actually helping your child by encouraging her not to communicate with her dad about any issues she may be having whilst under his roof. In fact, encouraging her to come to you while it is his custodial time to \"fix what your daddy's doing wrong\" instead of talking to him about it so they can come to an understanding IS definitively a form of parental alienation, and you might want to think about the message you're sending her.\n\nIf your daughter hates cafeteria food, she needs to have a conversation with her father about that, about why he has started sending her with lunch money, and about what alternatives they can come up with. If he is overwhelmed with work and too busy to make lunches perhaps she would like to start making her own lunches (you can help her make a list of what groceries she will need for her favourite sandwiches or whatever she usually takes from your house). But this is something for THEM to discuss, not for you to involve yourself with . . . at least not without talking to him first. This is HIS parenting time, not yours. Let him parent; encourage her to communicate with her father if she is unhappy. YTA for racing in to fix something on his time.", "NTA - Sounds like he is just lashing out cause he feels like his authority is being threatened by your actions.", "NTA, you made him look bad.", "NTA, though if this continues with him not giving his daughter a packed lunch, and you bringing her lunch...\n\nThat is something you could definitely use at any future court hearings to make him look bad.\n\nI feel like he knows this, but thinks he can just trick you into not doing it?  Rather then packing her a packed lunch.", "So, instead of talking to him about it on Saturday (when she went over to her dad's) you wait until it's Monday to bring her lunch? You knew about it Wednesday when she came to your house. Why didn't you just simply talk to her dad at drop off instead? This whole thing could have been handled easily by communicating. \n\nI can see why you brought her lunch. You want her to have what she wants. I can also see why her dad is upset. You failed to talk to him about the lunch thing when you had plenty of time to do so. You acted on what you wanted to do instead of talking to him about things. Coparenting can be hard, but you have to communicate with each other. \n\nESH", "Are you going to drop off dinner and breakfast at his house too if she says she doesn\u2019t like it?", "NTA...\n\nBut also, kids are notorious for pitting parents against each other.  Are you sure that she didn't tell your ex that kids don't pack anymore?  And then telling you that her dad doesn't pack her a lunch anymore?\n\nThere's way more to this story.", "YTA. During his time, it's up to him to manage her food.  If she doesn't like it, she should take it up with him first.  If she's still not satisfied, she could take it up with you and you could act like a co-parent and discuss it with him.  Instead, you went behind his back and played the hero.", "YTA. Would you like him overriding your choices during your parenting time? I am sure she can find something she will eat at school if she doesn\u2019t bring a packed lunch or she could take responsibility for her own lunch and pack one for herself if the schools food is unacceptable. His house, his time, his choice just like it is when she is with you.", "I'm gonna say YTA for not talking to him about it first. And before everyone jumps and says when OP did tell him, his reaction was shitty - well yeah of course it was. OP already overrode his choice without saying anything. Not cool.", "ESH. He has a right to give her lunch money on his days but if she has asked for a packed lunch or verbalized not liking the school lunch then why not make her lunch the night before and keep it consistent? It\u2019s not rocket science.\n\nThat said, OP should\u2019ve talked to dad about this first instead of making him feel undermined on his day. What\u2019s so hard about a message ahead of time regarding the lunches? You already have a highly tense relationship and should\u2019ve known this would add to it with your child firmly placed in the middle of these petty disputes.", "Okay, so I have to say a slight YTA. Yes, it is still his custody time with her so he is responsible for her meals and his choice to make her lunches. But you do need to talk to your ex and see why he has stopped making her lunch. It may be he got a pay cut or he doesn't have time to make her lunch. Like one person said, she can learn how to be responsible if she makes her own lunch the night before school. If it is a money issue, then offer to buy what your daughter needs so it can be put in a special place in your ex's fridge and make sure you let him know you aren't doing that to make him feel less of a parent, you're just helping your daughter and taking stress off of him", "ESH. It just smells like a reason to have a disagreement. I once had a coworker with kids that age who beg to do something at her house, then go home to their dad and complain about it (sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room.) The kids caused constant arguments between their parents over crap like that, apparently just for the fun of it. \n\nMaybe that isn't exactly what is going on here, but neither parent should butt in on the other's days over something so petty.

I don\u2019t think there is enough info to say if either is the asshole. Why did dad stop making the lunches?  Why didn\u2019t mom discuss this with dad before dropping off lunch?

These things are complicated and difficult and if communication is a problem then I have a better understanding of your actions.  I will say that I can understand how he could feel like you're just trying to swoop in and be the \"good parent\" but it wasn't helpful for him to lash out instead of explaining.  Equally, it would have been good if you had said that your daughter didn't like the school lunches and was trying to make sure she'd actually eat and thought it was easier for everyone this way instead of jumping to asking him why he stopped making lunches.  It's possible there's a reason he needed to do it for a time.  It's also equally possible that he's just being lazy.  Too hard to tell, and if your communication is that bad then it may be impossible to ever really know.  I'm going to lean toward a soft ESH but with the caveat that I understand this is a difficult situation.

What will you do?", "Sure she can, but how would she feel if the roles were reversed and during her time dad decided to show up with a happy meal and her lovingly packed lunch goes uneaten because dad brought her something she liked more. \n\nCoparenting requires communication, compromise,and to certain extent letting go.

Cafeteria lunch usually has very limited options that range from not bad at best to inedible at worst - when I was in high school it was not unheard of to find sawdust or other foreign objects in our food, but even barring that it was very rare for it to be appetizing. I had many days where I did not eat because the lunch was gross. \n\nYou also have to stand in line to get the cafeteria food, and in elementary school we had 20 minutes total for lunch. 10-15 of that was sometimes being taken up by waiting in line because it was so long. If you had a packed lunch you had more time to eat. I\u2019ve always been a slow eater so even without having to stand in line I felt rushed.

Did I eat much less healthily than I could have, and suffer through my afternoons hungry on many days? also yes.

Best wishes for you and your baby", "It was def supposed to be cornbread, US public school doesn't have the budget for anything that fancy.  And when I say it was like plah doh, I don't mean it was mushy.  I mean it had a clay-like malleability.  I once made a tiny unicorn out of the school cornbread, and it was structurally sound enough to stand up without sagging or breaking apart.", "He could, definitely. Because he split time 50/50 between me and his dad, it just felt like one of those little things I could do to send an \u201cI love you\u201d into his day. I didn\u2019t spoil him in most other respects and he\u2019s grown into a responsible man who can manage to slap a sammie together for himself and do his own laundry without expecting a gold star.", "Mine was middle of farm country but college town Michigan. (Mitten part of the state)", "Lol", "Oof. Yeah it seems like we were in k-12 in similar years. That sucks that you got that shit. I\u2019m a diabetic so I always had packed lunch anyway until I was a teen with a job and old enough to buy my own choices", "Yeah. I was glad either my mom or me usually packed my lunch. If it was a day with a deceit sounding option I would ask for money. Only time we had good food was during those standardize test weeks. Then the quality went up and it was free.", "Holy cow, that\u2019s nuts. I mean, my parents really wanted us to learn to do things ourselves, they were big on teaching us to do stuff. They were also good parents and looked after us well, but they didn\u2019t want us to be dependent as we got old enough to do basic things ourselves. By 15 I was helping with laundry and occasionally helping with cooking meals. I could use power tools and fix my own bike. Mowing the lawns became my chore at 15 or 16. That stuff is good for kids!", "Exactly! For some reason, people are downvoting my take.", "Fine your right mom can do whatever she likes even if it isn\u2019t her parenting time as long as it makes her daughter happy because dad doesn\u2019t have a right to parent as he sees fit during his time or have mom support his parenting choices. At this point he should just let mom make all parenting decisions since obviously she is the far superior parent and he just can\u2019t make the right decisions like mom can. \n\nWhat if mom got into an accident, had car trouble, or the daughter asked for as stop on the way home and dad is in a panic because she should be on the bus? \n\nI didn\u2019t want you to jump to weather appropriateness because equating school lunch to freezing on the play ground is silly. Obviously if the other parent fails to provide appropriate clothing that is a time mom should step in but if the child has good options at both homes but prefers one style over the other that is the equivalent to school vs homemade lunch. She choose to not try school lunch and that has consequences just like when children choose to wear weather inappropriate clothing and at some point they have to learn that all choices have consequences. It is one meal out of three she eats everyday. She won\u2019t starve if she misses one or two lunches a week. \n\nSheesh people it is about more than school lunch and that is why dad is upset and probably a small part of the reason they aren\u2019t together anymore.", "yeah the kid being able to eat lunch trumps dads feelings 100% of the time. the needs of children are more important than their parents feelings. not sure how anyone would disagree but here we are lol", "ESH you two sound as if you can't get along for the sake of your child and that's sad.", "NTA, it seems like this is about him and not his daughter.", "NTA", "NTA, WTF", "NTA, your intentions were good, but the two of you clearly need better communication or, in the long run, it will hurt your daughter.  Is there any neutral way you can suggest that the two of you meet with a therapist who deals with angry divorced couples who co-parent?  You could start of by apologizing for not telling him about the lunch you were dropping off first, as that kind of blind-sided him. Obviously he should apologize for the way he behaved on the phone, but we're not looking for justice here, just a way to get him to the counselor so the two of you can co-parent more smoothly.", "NTA !  And make sure next time you do any conversations or text so you have documentation it just sounds like your exes lazy and he didn\u2019t wanna make the lunch so we gave her some money instead", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe how many commenters are trying to attack and align malicious intent to your 7 year old kids preference for a sack lunch.", "Info: How old is she? If she\u2019s old enough to make her own lunches, she needs to.", "NTA. School lunches are gross and not enough food.", "NTA", "How is that parental alienation \ud83d\ude02 he\u2019s a jerk NTA", "Sounds like he is Lazy!!! NTA", "NTA but you and your ex need to figure out a better way of communicating and coparenting. I assume your daughter specifically asked for lunch. You didn\u2019t specify.", "My child also does not like the lunch at school or what his other parent packs for him.  So, I let him know it\u2019s ok to ask me to bring him lunch if I am able to.  I just want him to be happy and fed.  We don\u2019t discuss it with the other parent.  I don\u2019t bring it up either.  It doesn\u2019t become an issue that way.  I also make sure his lunch account has money so he can buy a healthy snack if he wants. I\u2019ve always told my child to just let me know what he needs.", "INFO: why didn't you call your daughter's father and talked about it before deciding to solve the situation by yourself?", "NTA\n\nSounds like the man cares more about being \u2018right\u2019 than having an effective co parenting relationship. Advice, I couldn\u2019t tell you. There\u2019s a dozen ways I\u2019d suggest you respectfully talk to him about this, but all of them involve having a rational conversation where you to listen to each other. But he doesn\u2019t sound capable of that and is more interested in proving his way the right way and having complete control on his days.", "So if he smacked her around on his days, it wouldn't be OP's business?", "She\u2019s 7. So no.", "That's... not how it works. It's the court's decision. OP can't just decide to change the custody agreement.", "You can't make your own lunch at 7 if your parent doesn't buy lunch food.", "Christ, you need therapy.", "Agree, it\u2019s nasty", "You need to edit your OP to put her age in there. It\u2019s highly relevant.", ">kid was fed a 4-hour old home-made ham sandwich or a sandwich purchased fresh-made at a deli.\n\nYeah, that's 100% not what American school lunches are.", "Plus, she should not have to. That literal his job as a parent on his parenting time", "She's seven.", "I have a video of a friend stabbing at a panini with a plastic fork until the fork broke. He stabbed the panini one last time and it broke like a frozen chocolate bar does. I still wonder how they could get bread and cheese to that consistency.", "That\u2019s exactly what my school did when came ketchup how ketchup a veggie ????", "I baby-sat a kid who, at 9, was not taught to cut her own food.\n\nWith a butter knife.\n\nI was like \"nah bro, you can do it\".", "She's fucking seven.", "Or he gave her the option - make your own lunch or eat cafeteria food, and she picked the cafeteria food and then complained to her mom about it.\n\n\nETA: nevermind, the kid is 7. That's too young to be responsible for making her own lunch every day.", "Sometimes people like their children.", "Wtf? You (we) don't even know wtf they're going through! Maybe the dad didn't have anything for the kid so he just gave the kid money that morning for lunch. Or he was lazy or something. Who knows? \n\nAnd your taking this way to seriously. Chill your ass down. OP is NTA for  bringing lunch for her kid. Pretty sure everyone would do the same for their own kid. Geez \ud83d\ude12", "And both my kids made lunches at that age. Not everyday but they sure can make a sandwich  grab a juice box  etc. I would remind them to put an ice pack in there in the morning. On the weekend we would sit down and plan. They would look at the menu foe the school online and decide which day they will eat at school and which day they would bring lunch. Then ask them what they wanted to bring.   If buy it. After diner I would tell them they need to make their lunch. They would put it in the fridge and just grab it adding 8ce pack in the morning.  7 year Olds are 100% capable of doing that with some guidance", "At 7 my kid was only responsible for grabbing his packed lunch, and we lived a 3 minute walk away so I'd still drop it off on the rare occasion he forgot. At 13 I buy him things to pack his own lunch and expect him to handle it, eat school lunch (it's free) or deal with hunger until he gets home. \nHe has sensory issues and has never liked school lunch. He would literally rather not eat than have most cafeteria food. I've tried to give him age appropriate responsibility though. A 7 year old would need serious guidance to pack their own lunches.", "Oh I am. That baby is now turning 16 at the end of the month. \n\nThank you!", "My parents pack my lunch until I graduated. It was easier and cheaper than keeping food specifically to pack lunches with, especially food we would fight over. My dad especially is an amazing cook who can bring together meals with ingredients you forgot you had. Having him pack lunches instead of us made it so that the family didn't have to go to the grocery store as often.\n\nIt's a sign of love and it's also pretty practical for some people.", "Unless he's not buying lunch supplies.", "She can buy a few extra things when she grocery shops and send them over with the child.", "Yeah, the guy who doesn't want her bringing a packed lunch is totally going to be okay with that.", "You don\u2019t get to make your point and then block me. I\u2019m always going to find a way to respond. If you don\u2019t want to have a conversation, then stop engaging me. \n\nAnd you\u2019re moving the goalposts anyway. Your previous objection was that the food may not be in the house. When I came up with a solution, you changed it to something else and then blocked me. You basically got mad because I had a rebuttal for your argument.\n\nYou don\u2019t know that the father doesn\u2019t want her taking lunch to school; none of that is implied in the OP. Maybe he is just too lazy to make her lunch.\n\n\nAre you the seven year old here?"]}
