Was he perhaps advocating for his sister and trying to help to establish a more even ground for her (even if it arguably wasn't his place)? My concern is that your wife may feel she needs to say what you want to hear to keep the peace - that it wasn't a problem. She may need you to show genuine curiosity for her needs and what kind of day she has had.", "Your wife has been pregnant for 4 years out of the 7 that you have been together? Bang maid?

How long had you been dating before you married her? She can be your daughter ffs. I wonder if she's one of your mate's daughters, or maybe a student of yours (it's not clear what your job is, so my imagination is running wild).\n\nI'm sorry, but this just sounds as if you groomed her first and then baby trapped her, not giving her any choice but become a SAHM. And also, your comment about this baby going to \"hopefully\" be the last one \"lol\" is gross and immature. Do you really need someone to tell you how to stop having so many children in such a little time? It can't be that good for your wife's health either.\n\nNow to answer your question, YTA and your BIL is probably worried about his sister, who stays at home the whole day, surrounded by children and you do fuck all to help her because you need to \"relax\" after work.", "YTA. Sounds like your brother in law has a point and is looking out for his sister. Your wife is already doing majority of childcare and tired herself, but you needed to recoup? He probably saw what she has to deal with on a daily basis, so of course he\u2019s upset on her behalf. Does she get any chance to relax?", "The fact she got married at 25 when you were 49, and had 5 kids in seven years do really sound like grooming or baby trapping her. For how long did you date before getting married and were you her first partner? All the years of youth you got to yourself, she didn't. Since she stays at home, she is also financially dependent of you, have less opportunities to have friends and share time with other adults, so she probably is isolated and her life revolve around the kids, the home, and you, but nothing really for herself. Beside being a stay at home mom, especially with so many kids, is a 24hours jobs with no week end and no holidays, so i am not sure that how you decided to share the chores are really equal. Feels like she is isolated and can't escape even if she wanted to. Honestly it can work for both of you and she was never coerced or anything, but these are mostly the rare case when we see such an age gap and i am very dubious when i read such posts. I understand where your brother in law comes from, and i would see if your wife didn't actually vent to him and she doesn't know how to speak to you about this. Beside even if she did not, look at the situation how it really is, because even if your wife agreed to this, she still is very much financially dependent of you and missed on a lot of her youth.\nI think it's NTA because it's your home and he was disrespectful. However your wife is clearly in a position of inequality and i feel really bad for her, my heart would vote YTA for the situation you put her in, in the first place.\n\nEdit: and to the specific points that lead you to put him out. Really dude, when do you think your wife can take one hour to herself ? You spent the day out of the house with adults, and instead of parenting your kids, you still take one hour while she probably had no break in the day and is surrounded by kids all the time. You can work like that because she is doing all the free childcare and housework for you, her day doesn't end when you come home, but instead of helping her, you still take one hour for you and refuse the criticism. How much time do you spend actually parenting your kids ? And i am not speaking of the fun play time with them\n\nEdit2: thank you for the award u/Pornchips and your username made me laugh.

I cannot believe how dismissive are you of your own situation. You talk about your wife 6th pregnancy like you didnt participated. You say you HELP her with chores when you and her live in the house, so you should not HELP with anything, but man up and split chores.\n\nAnd after all that, you want AN HOUR to relax before taking care of YOUR kids that your PREGNANT WIFE look after all day?

If he\u2019s not then can he?   \n\n\nYour wife feels bad to be in between you and her brother. Both of you are right and wrong at the same time. She is incredibly vulnerable, a situation of your and her making, and that is probably at play here too. You say you\u2019ve been nothing but good, but is it a tiny bit possibly you could be \u2018more\u2019 good? Is there a kernel of truth, a tiny corn kernel there of something that might sprout - that you could do better? Maybe not have her back to back pregnant? Maybe help out more as an adult in the house during the witching hour? Maybe if you can\u2018t bear to do that after a long hard day grab the grocery list and go out and do that so she doesn\u2019t have to (and clear you head ready to carry on, even better take the easiest child with you to help and reduce her head count).   \n\n\nParenting is a team sport. It\u2019s not chess where you clack the clock and the timer runs for the other person. Split the duties, divide and conquer the marauding kids, and if you can\u2019t cope in the moment tap out but don\u2019t drop the whole game.", "I'm sorry,but your wife spend way too much time pregnant.. literally more than half your marriage she was pregnant, and you joke bout this pregnancy too,get a damned vasectomy.\n\nYou sound like you baby trapped this poor woman, she's a SHM, with no money to leave and is constantly pregnant.. ew, shame on you.

You don't get to stay in someone's home, rent free, and pass judgement on the way their house is run.

She \"mostly\" agrees with you, which means that she doesn't on everything. It may be that she had made some comments to her brother about the setup. 5 kids is a huge responsibility. To be looking after them all while pregnant with another will be exhausting.  70/30 isn't enough on your part. Once you are in from work, you step up and be responsible for your kids. If you are both exhausted, then look into getting help. A cleaner, a nanny, just someone who can take some of the tasks off both of your plates.\n\nAnd for the love of god, use a condom.

Logically speaking, it is the right answer, i think, when we look about op's legal right toward the house. But it stays very shady and the only reason i am not voting YTA is because we don't know what his wife think. I still think it's despicable how he acted when he got home. Even if she likes it, she is financially dependent of him, which i would not wish to anyone. The way they decided to have a family put the woman in a position of dependence and inferiority toward her husband, and most of the time, the work they do is not recognized enough or taken lightly. Older men are able to provide this life more comfortably exactly because they are not the one to stay at home and had time to live their life. I think your brain is not fully developped until 25 years old, which is why i asked when they started to date, which is logically a few years before they got married. Beside it is well known that some older men will pray on younger women to groom them. If in ten years she regrets it, she will be considered a bad mom, but the truth is, she really does have less life experience than him and had less time to find what she really wants for her future. I said it could be totally consensual, i took this option into account, and you not being able to read is not my problem. Saying that in many cases the woman got groomed when we see such situation doesn't negate the fact it can be consensual and if you read it like that, it's not my issue either. I stay doubtful because in many cases it is shady, and because being dependant of your partner is not something to wish to anyone. Also, women who stay at home do have less connection with adults and a harder time to sociabilise, because kiddos are always there and always a priority. How many time did we see stay at home mom put their kids in total priority and be lost and depressed once they leave the home ? \nI can't assume she is a victim but you can't assume she is not one, because we have no indication that it's what she wanted all along either.", "If you didn't want to get hurt in an accident you shouldn't have bought a car!

I just see a lot of jumping to conclusions and it irks me. At the end of the day I don't assume every woman is a fragile being in need of saving. You act like there are not calculated women who deliberately go after older men with money in their young age so they can get financial security. You act like OP is using a walker. He could be an attractive fit man with money that she admired and pursued. You don't know her motive for marrying him, and you don't know that she was groomed. She wasn't 16 when she got married. She was an adult. Give her some credit. The fact that she keeps having children means she probably feels safe. I'm sure she knows what birth control is. Not every woman staying at home with children is a victim.  If she wanted, she could leave and get financial assistance because she has so many children. The fact that her brother was even given the option to stay with them, before he got disrespectful, means that OP's not trying to isolate her from her family or support system.

FIVE. listen, with ONE you put very much of yourself on hold in order to be a parent. with his prior establishment of himself and his career, and her lack of, AND her lack of ability to have done those things for herself since she\u2019s raising a sufficiently-populated basketball team and managing a household comprised of like a whole preschool class (but with INFANTS in the mix), renders her STUCK and very much at his whim. \n\ninstead of using his more established age to ensure her quality of life AT HER CURRENT AGE as well as his own, he has her popping out a whole new full-time job every so often and she doesn\u2019t have a chance to consider any other options or opportunities. \n\nage gap partnerships are as wonderful as any wonderful partnership/relationship experience as long as the imbalance of power is noted and adjusted for BEFORE the romance starts.\n\ni don\u2019t want to speculate about how this couple came to know one another, but i need to mention this too: it\u2019s often even more of a red flag when someone is SEEKING OUT those age gap relationships. as i said before, *when comfortable, fulfilling relationships fall into place despite an age gap, it\u2019s beautiful to see two ppl grow their two distinct lives together like that*. but ppl who are *LOOKING* for them are often (not always) looking for validation or fetishizing an experience (ex: a younger person only wanting to date older partners) or for someone who will be easy to control or for \u201caesthetic\u201d reasons (ex: 49 yr old person only looking for ppl in their 20s).\n\ncall me crazy, but a dude who whines about getting an hour to himself before taking FIVE CHILDREN off his pregnant wife\u2019s hands after being gone all day knowing she has had NO break and no moment when someone isn\u2019t prodding or asking or overtired and whining (clearly *including* the moment her husband walks in the door) is pretty unlikely to have been paying much attention at all to his wife\u2019s wants, needs, and quality of life. he holds his ability to be out of the house over her head. she is not free even if she wants to be. he has either intentionally or unintentionally made sure of it.\n\nand that, my friend, is an imbalance of power. it is unhealthy at best, almost always neglectful, very often abusive, and deadly at worst.\n\nage gaps: done right, literally fine with most ppl.\nimbalance of power: shouldn\u2019t be fine w anybody.\n\nETA: grammar/clarity", "I\u2019m saying the brother doesn\u2019t have to take care of those kids because he\u2019s not a part of that mutual decision process.
