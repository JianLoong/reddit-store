Was he perhaps advocating for his sister and trying to help to establish a more even ground for her (even if it arguably wasn't his place)? My concern is that your wife may feel she needs to say what you want to hear to keep the peace - that it wasn't a problem. She may need you to show genuine curiosity for her needs and what kind of day she has had.", "Your wife has been pregnant for 4 years out of the 7 that you have been together? Bang maid? More like breeding pony.", "I really tried to ignore the age gap and just answer the question, but I can't.\n\nYou got married when she was 25 and you were FORTY-NINE which is very disturbing and then managed to have 5 kids (almost 6) in the space of 7 years. How long had you been dating before you married her? She can be your daughter ffs. I wonder if she's one of your mate's daughters, or maybe a student of yours (it's not clear what your job is, so my imagination is running wild).\n\nI'm sorry, but this just sounds as if you groomed her first and then baby trapped her, not giving her any choice but become a SAHM. And also, your comment about this baby going to \"hopefully\" be the last one \"lol\" is gross and immature. Do you really need someone to tell you how to stop having so many children in such a little time? It can't be that good for your wife's health either.\n\nNow to answer your question, YTA and your BIL is probably worried about his sister, who stays at home the whole day, surrounded by children and you do fuck all to help her because you need to \"relax\" after work.", "YTA. Sounds like your brother in law has a point and is looking out for his sister. Your wife is already doing majority of childcare and tired herself, but you needed to recoup? He probably saw what she has to deal with on a daily basis, so of course he\u2019s upset on her behalf. Does she get any chance to relax?", "The fact she got married at 25 when you were 49, and had 5 kids in seven years do really sound like grooming or baby trapping her. For how long did you date before getting married and were you her first partner? All the years of youth you got to yourself, she didn't. Since she stays at home, she is also financially dependent of you, have less opportunities to have friends and share time with other adults, so she probably is isolated and her life revolve around the kids, the home, and you, but nothing really for herself. Beside being a stay at home mom, especially with so many kids, is a 24hours jobs with no week end and no holidays, so i am not sure that how you decided to share the chores are really equal. Feels like she is isolated and can't escape even if she wanted to. Honestly it can work for both of you and she was never coerced or anything, but these are mostly the rare case when we see such an age gap and i am very dubious when i read such posts. I understand where your brother in law comes from, and i would see if your wife didn't actually vent to him and she doesn't know how to speak to you about this. Beside even if she did not, look at the situation how it really is, because even if your wife agreed to this, she still is very much financially dependent of you and missed on a lot of her youth.\nI think it's NTA because it's your home and he was disrespectful. However your wife is clearly in a position of inequality and i feel really bad for her, my heart would vote YTA for the situation you put her in, in the first place.\n\nEdit: and to the specific points that lead you to put him out. Really dude, when do you think your wife can take one hour to herself ? You spent the day out of the house with adults, and instead of parenting your kids, you still take one hour while she probably had no break in the day and is surrounded by kids all the time. You can work like that because she is doing all the free childcare and housework for you, her day doesn't end when you come home, but instead of helping her, you still take one hour for you and refuse the criticism. How much time do you spend actually parenting your kids ? And i am not speaking of the fun play time with them\n\nEdit2: thank you for the award u/pornchips and your username made me laugh", "Well, he's got a point, doesn't he?

I mean yeah, he kinda suck for complaining about his hosts, but it seems like he has a point.\n\nYTA relax when the kids go to bed.", "YTA. I cannot believe how dismissive are you of your own situation. You talk about your wife 5th pregnancy like you didnt participated. You say you HELP her with chores when you and her live in the house, so you should HELP with anything, but man up and split chores.\n\nAnd after all that, you want AN HOUR to relax before taking care of YOUR kids that your PREGNANT WIFE look after all day? Huge YTA. Your BIL is right", "Info: what your wife thinks about all this?", "ESH except your wife.   \nYour brother in law has made some rather sweeping assumptions, based on evidence mind you (holy moly that\u2019s a lot of time pregnant and feeding and nappies for such a short marriage!), but he\u2019s putting his assumptions on you.   \nYou are wanting to have quiet time at the exact time that the witching hour hits, kids and pets and dementing people go nuts, and your wife is equally tired and worn out (and possibly even more tired if she\u2019s pulling the overnight wake ups and the early morning baby duties?) \u2026 At that hour she NEEDS your help, or she\u2019s wrangling a lot of tired little people through baths, dinner, bed, and you won\u2019t even spend time with them because they\u2018ll zonk out.  \nIf it is a super rare one of - that I understand - we all have days like this, maybe once a month at most. If that\u2019s the case then I get it, and you are NTA.   \n\n\nIn all this what is Uncle doing to help? He\u2019s around rent free. He could help too. Is he? If he\u2019s not then can he?   \n\n\nYour wife feels bad to be in between you and her brother. Both of you are right and wrong at the same time. She is incredibly vulnerable, a situation of your and her making, and that is probably at play here too. You say you\u2019ve been nothing but good, but is it a tiny bit possibly you could be \u2018more\u2019 good? Is there a kernel of truth, a tiny corn kernel there of something that might sprout - that you could do better? Maybe not have her back to back pregnant? Maybe help out more as an adult in the house during the witching hour? Maybe if you can\u2018t bear to do that after a long hard day grab the grocery list and go out and do that so she doesn\u2019t have to (and clear you head ready to carry on, even better take the easiest child with you to help and reduce her head count).   \n\n\nParenting is a team sport. It\u2019s not chess where you clack the clock and the timer runs for the other person. Split the duties, divide and conquer the marauding kids, and if you can\u2019t cope in the moment tap out but don\u2019t drop the whole game.", "I'm sorry,but your wife spend way too much time pregnant.. literally more than half your marriage she was pregnant, and you joke bout this pregnancy too,get a damned vasectomy.\n\nYou sound like you baby trapped this poor woman, she's a SHM, with no money to leave and is constantly pregnant.. ew, shame on you. YTA", "YTA and her brother is right. You pumped half of a football team into your young wife and now you need to take responsibility (and a condom). You can relax when the kids are sleeping or you think your wife\u2019s days are easy with 5 kids while being pregnant?", "INFO: How did you get together at 49 and 25 and how long after did she become pregnant with your first baby?", "I just want to say that the phrase 'bang maid' makes me picture a balloon in a little maid outfit.\n\nI'll see myself out.", "Info - did you ask your wife if it was ok to kick her brother out? Why do you refer to it as 'my' house instead of 'our' house?", "You know what YTA just for marrying a 25-year-old at 49 and knocking her up six times in seven years.\n\nLearn about birth control and don't creep on people half your age.", "Every day more and more redditors fall for faker and faker \"opposite POV\" totally fictional, made for a \"tik tok with subway surfer in the background\" posts and the mods are fine with it.", "YTA", "YTA. An hour in the evening is a long time with young kids, and that probably means you would have missed most of your time with them before bedtime. That\u2019s actually a lot to ask of your pregnant wife.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not working, you should be an equal parent, particularly with 5 kids. Sounds like you took your bad work day as an excuse to kick your BIL out and shirk on your parenting duties.", "YTA. Your wife hates you. She wants to leave, but your prenup is airtight.\n\nWell played", "NTA, this is your house and being repetitievely disrespected by a freeloader is certainly too much.\n\nFor people who judge you on the age gap, your wife was 25 when she married you based on your post, not 18, she was an adult and she choose you, tell them to eat a sock.\n\nBut also, with so many children your wife is definitievely exhausted (heck i got just 2 twins at home and me and my wife are overdrawn) you might wish to consider to look for some help for her, because she also deserve a break, i can understand why her elder brother would get annoyed at the situation, altough he was out of line.", "NTA and an easy call.

You don't get to stay in someone's home, rent free, and pass judgement on the way their house is run. You certainly don't refer to someone as a bang-maid in front of their children.\n\nI would have an honest conversation with your wife, though. She \"mostly\" agrees with you, which means that she doesn't on everything. It may be that she had made some comments to her brother about the setup. 5 kids is a huge responsibility. To be looking after them all while pregnant with another will be exhausting.  70/30 isn't enough on your part. Once you are in from work, you step up and be responsible for your kids. If you are both exhausted, then look into getting help. A cleaner, a nanny, just someone who can take some of the tasks off both of your plates.\n\nAnd for the love of god, use a condom. There's no use hoping it's your last unless you take precautions. Get the snip if you don't want to faff with rubbers.", "NTA.

What's better time spent with your kids? When you are irritated and short tempered or when you have a bit of time to collect yourself and set the day aside?

Logically speaking, it is the right answer, i think, when we look about op's legal right toward the house. But it stays very shady and the only reason i am not voting YTA is because we don't know what his wife think. I still think it's despicable how he acted when he got home. Even if she likes it, she is financially dependent of him, which i would not wish to anyone. The way they decided to have a family put the woman in a position of dependence and inferiority toward her husband, and most of the time, the work they do is not recognized enough or taken lightly. Older men are able to provide this life more comfortably exactly because they are not the one to stay at home and had time to live their life. I think your brain is not fully developped until 25 years old, which is why i asked when they started to date, which is logically a few years before they got married. Beside it is well known that some older men will pray on younger women to groom them. If in ten years she regrets it, she will be considered a bad mom, but the truth is, she really does have less life experience than him and had less time to find what she really wants for her future. I said it could be totally consensual, i took this option into account, and you not being able to read is not my problem. Saying that in many cases the woman got groomed when we see such situation doesn't negate the fact it can be consensual and if you read it like that, it's not my issue either. I stay doubtful because in many cases it is shady, and because being dependant of your partner is not something to wish to anyone. Also, women who stay at home do have less connection with adults and a harder time to sociabilise, because kiddos are always there and always a priority. How many time did we see stay at home mom put their kids in total priority and be lost and depressed once they leave the home ? \nI can't assume she is a victim but you can't assume she is not one, because we have no indication that it's what she wanted all along either.", "If you didn't want to get hurt in an accident you shouldn't have bought a car!

I just see a lot of jumping to conclusions and it irks me. At the end of the day I don't assume every woman is a fragile being in need of saving. You act like there are not calculated women who deliberately go after older men with money in their young age so they can get financial security. You act like OP is using a walker. He could be an attractive fit man with money that she admired and pursued. You don't know her motive for marrying him, and you don't know that she was groomed. She wasn't 16 when she got married. She was an adult. Give her some credit. The fact that she keeps having children means she probably feels safe. I'm sure she knows what birth control is. Not every woman staying at home with children is a victim.  If she wanted, she could leave and get financial assistance because she has so many children. The fact that her brother was even given the option to stay with them, before he got disrespectful, means that OP's not trying to isolate her from her family or support system.

Nope, you failed to see the nuance and answered based on skipping it. Will you tell me that grooming and baby trapping never happens ?

Obviously, your wife is OK with the way you are living with the age gap, and all of the children so you are not \u201cusing\u201d her for anything. She is a consenting adult and can live her life the way that she wants and so can you. You\u2019re going to be ripped in this comment section but don\u2019t listen to them.

Otherwise, IMO, it feels like we are denying that person's agency. \nI think 25 is old enough to know what marrying a 50 year old entails.", "I feel it\u2019s a safe bet that your wife has been confiding in her brother and he\u2019s defending her, at least when it comes to the issue of childcare and possibly the notion that you are using her as your bang maid. You should probably reconsider your how much you contribute at home. I don\u2019t think this is all of his making. No judgement, but I think you could have hidden issues that that your brother brought to the surface. Most women want more out of life than babies and a home to clean, I\u2019m almost certain your wife had brought this up in conversation with your BIL. Time to talk about snipping mr. Penis.", "Might get down voted to oblivion here, but imma say NTA.", "YTA", "NTA.  nobody made her get pregnant, obviously she wanted a family and kids too.  if he was abusing her, why would he bother having all these children or marrying her?  if she's happy, all these bangmaid comments can kick rocks.  some women like older men and 25 years old is plenty mature to make your own decisions in life.  all of these YTA comments are sexist and give this woman zero credit to make her own decisions.  he provides for her and even helps around the house, which can't be said for a lot of these deadbeat dads", "nta", "NTA. Guys it really isn't our place to judge the age gap and dynamics of the relationship. We are here to determine if OP was the asshole in this situation. I see this every time someone shares and has an age gap. People completely lose focus of the matter at hand. Sounds to me like the brother needs to be a bit more respectful. He doesn't have to like you, but I think we can all agree that a wise person doesn't make those sorts of snide comments and then turn around and continue to ask a favor of you. Which is that he gets to continue living under your roof. You did what you had to do, in my estimate. Making your kids cry by saying derogatory comments about their mother and father is not cool.", ">she's pregnant currently (hopefully our last lol)\n\nHave you ever heard of birth control?", "YTA", "These comments are wild.  25 year olds are grown ass adults they are not getting groomed.

Don't let the door hit you on the way out. And come on people they are consenting adults age only matters if one is under age.", "OP YTA. Her brother has a point, even if it wasn't his place to say. Your wife doesn't get time off while she's pregnant. She's working 24/7 with ZERO time off because her body is taking life away from itself and giving it to the baby.

After a hard day at work, it is helpful to power-down briefly so you are ready for \u2018showtime\u2019 at the second job (at home).  You were not wrong for wanting a short break before engaging at home.  However, you and your wife should communicate as it appears her expectation is that you will \u2018take over\u2019 as soon as you walk in the door.  You also may need to consider some paid professional assistance at home.  Being pregnant with 5 very young children at home is very difficult as is having a rough day at work.  There is no shame in hiring help.", "NTA - for kicking out the brother.... if someone is a guest in your house they need to stay out of your personal life.

My MIL had 13 kids. Your BIL needed to go as he was causing stress in the house. \nI personally feel 1 hour to decompress and recharge your battery after working 8-9hrs was not alot to ask.

She \"mostly\" agrees with you, which means that she doesn't on everything. It may be that she had made some comments to her brother about the setup. 5 kids is a huge responsibility.
