It\u2019s something I\u2019ve loved since I was a child and I bought some merchandise over the years.

My cousin (33F) comes over unannounced today with her three kids, (15M), (16F), and (14F). Now I love my cousin and her kids, I don\u2019t mind them stopping by even when I\u2019m not there. My cousins been like a older sister/mother to me all of my life. She told me they stopped by my place because the kids wanted to see me. I let her know I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes. I had just left to go buy some groceries. \n\n\nI return home put my groceries up and speak with her and the kids, all is going well until the 14 year old asks me for some money. I deny her request as I don\u2019t get paid for another week and nothing special is happening so I\u2019m not just out here giving money away. She gets infuriated and says I let her down. And yada yada. It\u2019s whatever to me and we chill for a few hours and they leave. That was yesterday. I come home from work today and get a text from the sixteen year old saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry Unc, she just said she left something there\u201d I\u2019m mainly relaxed since she has a habit of leaving things and I go to my room. My shelf is annihilated, everything is thrown down and broken, all the figures are missing body parts, my dragon balls are broken and that drawing I spent 3 months on finishing is cut to shreds. And some of my hoodies and shirts are gone, my capsule corp hat is gone. I broke down crying and called their mom. I tell her I need her key back and tell her what her daughter did, I then let her know she owes me about $1,500 dollars over this and this is me being generous.

Now, was it irrational? Clearly, but that doesn\u2019t make or unintentional.", "This was absolutely pre meditated. She cooked up a lie and took the key and got her own sister to drive her there so she could intentionally destroy shit. This isn't just a rage omg I kicked the TV threw my phone in a blind fit type stuff this had thought and time put into it.", "That's awful, I'm so sorry. Well, if she won't even discuss it with you then you may as well file a police report and take her to court. Nothing to salvage here, unfortunately  :-/", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the 14 year old downplayed things. \n\nPlease listen to what everyone is suggesting. It sucks but it\u2019s your cousin that is forcing your hand", "Hmm. That sounds like there\u2019s another layer behind this, as in 14 has done some advance smear campaign against OP. You\u2019ve had a great lifelong relationship with your cousin, even trusted her with the key to your home, and suddenly you get a terse \u201cyou\u2019re not getting paid.\u201d\n\nSomething is definitely wrong. NTA OP.  So sorry that your kindness has been repaid with vandalism and bad attitude. Cousin needs to know about the money requests. Good luck!", "That 14 yr old probably has a known track record of such behavior,  maybe not on the same scale, but this don't just start out of the blue.\n\nETA: why not text unc \"hey, brat forget stuff at your place, is it OK if I take her there to get it?\"", "Not that you are aware of.", "That you know of. I'm sure enabling mom does. Call the cops and don't listen to any family members saying that the willful destruction and theft of your property is just something that you should get over. Kid will be in juvenile court soon with worse crimes. They burned the bridge. NOT you. You're the victim of a crime and NTA.", "Have you called the cops yet?  Your cousins and her daughter already made their decisions. \n\nTime to get off the internet and call the cops now. The longer you wait the worse this get for you.", "The other option is for OP to get nothing. They're the ones involving the police since they won't settle out of court.", "Without the report, you cannot make an insurance claim. If the mother isn't going to pay then there is no way to recoup the loss. I'm not in favor of calling the police generally, but OP has no choice if they want to be reimbursed. A small claim suit may be an option however without the report the odds of it being successful are lower. $3000 is a lot of money for most people.\n\nEdit: maybe you can offer to give OP the $3,000 for their loss. You know, cut \u201cbig daddy government\u201d out of the equation.", "The police aren't going to actually investigate this. Contacting them would be to get a report. OP could go to the station and do this. The police don't have to go to anyone\u2019s house.", "Dumbass thinks the cops are actually going to come by and investigate instead of filing the paperwork and going back to the doughnuts.", "As if the police would bother following up on this", "Fuck around and find out", "where do you live? Where I come from, anyone trying to come to my house to take my property will get shot.", "I have a friend whose daughter was badgering her to give her house to a granddaughter.  She's such a pushover for her daughter and grandchildren that she said that she supposed that she would have to do it.\n\nI used the logic that you just did - could she afford to give all of her grandchildren the amount of money that would equal the house - because they would certainly demand it!", "Their mom is probably putting them up to this. OP is going to be better off without this twisted family in her life, sadly.", "I get that everything is more expensive these days but what kind of entitled brat asks a non-parent for that much money just to piss away? And then to go damage cherished personal property because she didn't get her way. What else has she done out of anger that the mother brushes under the rug ffs.", "I'm only saying that the term \"intent\" will be specifically defined in the insurance policy and that OP should make sure they fit the definition before making a claim (a denied claim can raise your rates just like a paid claim).\n\nThis is super technical and is how insurance companies screw people over. But can also be used as a hammer against the insurance companies if you do your homework.", "So your stuff>someone\u2019s life, just say it out loud  b.", "His*\n\n\nBiased much?", "Something is really, really *wrong* with that child.  To me it sounds so serious that I doubt the kid will improve without some sort of professional intervention.", "So insurance doesn't cover acts of vandalism?", "You're 100% wrong and giving horrible advice. Take the down votes as a sign and stop at this point.", "Okay, so can I go to your house and take all your property then?", "No, just inattentive.", "Depends on the circumstances and the specific policy terms.\n\nBut there is a public policy against letting people insure themselves against bad acts. So it is unlikely that the parent's liability insurance (included in their home insurance) would cover the claim: OP would have to pursue OPs own policy coverage for\"accidental damage\" rather than pursue a liability claim against the parent's coverage. And since OP let the teens into the room, the claim might be denied on that basis.\n\nBasically, the carrier denies coverage on any and every pretext and the insured has to go after them, hopefully using the terms their own policy as a hammer.", "Sick strawman bro that\u2019s awesome, if you\u2019re putting words in my mouth then do me a solid and put a barrel in yours."]}
