Or there is also the chance of you being an angelic soul, where you can just completely forgive her and let it go without any grudges - this is the only way that won't rip you guys apart.\n\nBut I think filing a report and small claims would be the best option because you should really teach them that these types of actions have consequences. They did this to a family member and are taking advantage that you might not do anything. But later on, what if the 14 yo does this to someone else? Does something even WORSE than destroying a few items or break something MORE expensive? What has your cousin done to reprimand and punish the 14 yo? If your cousin has done nothing, then she is teaching the 14 yo that she can just get away with it and mommy can bail her out. But what if the 14 yo does something later that is worse where mommy can't bail her out of it? \n\nYou need to show your cousin that this is something serious. Right now, banning her from your home is nothing and doesn't affect them in any way. Please go and file a report before the 14 yo grows up thinking she can get away with things like this and show your cousin that she is doing wrong by allowing this destructive behaviour slide.\n\nThe right thing to do was your cousin should've have either paid you back and have her 14 yo pay her back in chores or getting a pt job when she's old enough, until the debt is paid off as punishment and not allow her daughter to go to your house until she's apologized and gained your trust back.", "Don't listen to that, your never too old! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nBut seriously, file the police report!\n\nNTA", "OP is *faaaaamily* too and needs to be reimbursed.

The truly chilling, truly terrifying thing about all of this was that this was NOT a teenager throwing a tantrum.  Hearing \u201cno\u201d and losing her cool and immediately storming back to Uncle\u2019s game room to trash his stuff would have been bad, but understandable from someone who is young and needs help to learn to control her anger.  \n\nThis was NOT a tantrum.  This was a coldly calculated plan.   OP says he refused to give Niece money, and then they all continued to hang out for a few more hours.\n\nNiece gave no hint what she was thinking, but rather held her tongue and plotted the best way to make him pay for denying her.  She went home. She went to sleep.  She woke up, could have decided that she\u2019d cooled down enough to let it go.  She didn\u2019t let it go.  She had HOURS to change her mind, but she was laser focused on revenge. \n\nShe made her plan: take Mom\u2019s key to Uncle\u2019s house, lie to big sis so she could be driven over, and then proceeded to trash everything that Uncle loved.\n\nWhy? Because he told her\u201dno\u201d.\n\nThis girl needs psych ward level help.", "I suspect from the way his cousin was so quick to tell him he could have his key back, but that he wasn\u2019t getting \u201cpaid for this\u201d, and then quickly told OP it was HIS fault for not locking the game room door- that Mom knows, or at least heavily suspects, that 14 yo has done unnerving things before.

I will pay you, of course\u2026\u201d or if she couldn\u2019t afford it right now, say so, but that her first priority was finding out what was going on with her kid to see why she did this.  \n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to involve the authorities.  I don\u2019t want this girl to get tossed in detention and forgotten about, I would like to see her psych evaluated and possibly committed to get treatment.

It's a pretty well-studied topic now. We also know that many precautions people take against \"stranger danger\" just aren't that effective most of the time anyway. Some are just common sense, of course, but teaching children, for example, to \"never talk to strangers\" is shown to generally *not* helpful at all, and can even be dangerous if a child needs help or can't be communicated with.", "Yeah. You should always just state that you\u2019re going to the police. If there\u2019s any chance of getting compensation before involving the authorities, the other person will bring it up.
