Also what if she would be sleeping already and you wake her? Would probably also upset her. You should establish rules when living together.", "NTA - You told her when you would be back and she said he would be gone by then. Sure people lose track of time sometimes but that's not your fault. I feel like she is making this a bigger issue than it needs to be. I mean it's also your room. I saw that you've been rooming together for 3 years and this has never been an issue. But maybe it's time to sit down and talk about some rules. Like maybe if a boyfriend is over something gets hung on the door or something like that?", "NTA. This is why the sock on the doorknob thing exists. You two need to establish some sort of signal to indicate you're not alone in the room and the other person should knock. It's your room, too, you took her at her word about when he was likely to leave, and it's unreasonable for her to expect you to predict whether he might still be there. Especially after a potentially exhausting work shift, but really any time. You're neither psychic nor telepathic. You could just as easily say she should've texted you to let you know...but that would be unreasonable since she was probably caught up in the moment and lost track of time.\n\nSeriously, Do Not Disturb hanger, sock on the doorknob, etc. And then establish what the expectations are for when the signal is up. Can you knock and then enter when they give you the all clear? Are you barred from the room for the night? Something in between?", "NTA, but do stop to be a prople pleaser. She never asked you to spend the night out, nor didn't she tell you he will be staying. She is taking advantage of you here", "NTA- I would never knock on my own door when I get home, that seems ridiculous to even suggest. The expectation of privacy in a shared space is delusional.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKnocking would have been niche - but it is YOUR room too, after all. If they want privacy, the need to go somewhere else.", "INFO: You've been living with this girl for a while. Has the concept of knocking been brought up before? Do they knock for you?", "NAH...Sure, you could have knocked, she also knows that it's your room and you could come in at any time. These are the things you work out BEFORE moving in together.  Sit down now and work out some basic ground rules.", "Yeah, shared rooms = you knock, always. Or have a rule where door shut = knock and door open/ajar = come in.", "Not super clear cut, but I think I'm gonna say NTA. Yeah, you probably should've knocked; but honestly if you're sharing a room this sort of thing sounds kind of inevitable. If she specifically told you he'd be gone when you got home; you had no reason to expect any different.\nSure, best practice is probably to knock any time you're going into that room when she could be in there already; but failing to do that is at worst mildly thoughtless, which after a late shift is very understandable. Certainly not asshole behaviour. Sounds like you just walked into your own room in a way that you presumably have many times before; and it's never been an issue. You couldn't have known this time would be different. Probably best to knock in future; but I wouldn't say this is anything worth losing sleep over.", "NTA. You got home around when you were supposed to and entered your own room. Your roommate should be more considerate.", "NAH - \n\nThis is why men put a sock or tie on the door handle.\n\nI think the two of you should get past the blaming part. You both fucked up. Take accountability for not knocking. She takes it for not communicating and following through. \n\nConsider this a learning moment for both of you. You're both young women with sexual desires and sharing a room. Come up with a better system.", "I mean... do you think she's wrong?\n\nIf you agree that you should have knocked, and you plan to knock next time, then it was just an accident, you've learned your lesson, and NTA for making a mistake when you were tired.", "YTA - You ALWAYS known when entering a shared room.  Especially when the door is closed.", "YTA. It may be a shared room, but if the door is closed, it's just polite. What if she would have been changing?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't do anything wrong in this scenario.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFO:  Do you usually knock, or is this a new thing?", "NTA. Tell her to either lock it or put a sock on the door if they're worried about you entering.", "NTA", "NTA\u2026I understand why she\u2019s annoyed, but you did nothing wrong. Maybe find a system to let the other person know they are doing something private. Like hanging something on the doorknob", "NTA. If it locks, lock it. If it doesn\u2019t lock, put a sock over the doorknob as a reminder to stop and knock.", "Yeah, we never really sat down and established rules. But we\u2019ve lived together for like 3 years now, and it wasn\u2019t ever an issue beforehand.

We change around each other, that\u2019s never been an issue either.", "Yeah, you're especially NTA since there's an established precedent here.", "Oh okay, well then. NTA", "Yeah then NTA\n\nI'd suggest asking them for a way to communicate that they might be getting freaky to you if you come home. Think sock on door or something perhaps a little less basic. Knocking relies on you remembering to do so each time. Plus it could wake someone who is sleeping.", "Maybe it's time to just have that conversation that if the door is closed, the other person knocks.", "I\u2019m gonna ask her about using a do not disturb sign or something. The door is always closed because our room is right next to the kitchen and it\u2019s always loud, so a closed door doesn\u2019t really specifically say \u201cI need privacy rn\u201d if that makes sense.", "I think that's a good solution  \ud83d\ude0a"]}
