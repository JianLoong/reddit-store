In my own opinion, misleading someone that you're supposed to love for five years? No that would not be okay with me and I would probably have done the same thing as OP in cutting all ties with someone that has proven themselves to be this untrustworthy, relative or not. \n\nIf there are underlying problems that led to the behaviour? I hope that OP's daughter seeks assistance in dealing with those problems instead of moving on to hurt someone else in the same way in the future, being troubled and needing help is one thing but dismissing this type of behaviour and moving on to continue it into the future? No not okay.\n\nThe inheritance, your money your decision I agree but! Might I suggest leaving your daughter's share to your son instead of a charity? Or perhaps to future grandchildren that he provides you? For one, at least where I live, it's harder to contest a will that names a family member over a charity, if she contested it here, she would most certainly get her half and besides that, your son is more likely going to get more out of any money that you leave him and his children than some charity, charity begins at home after all.", "If you\u2019re looking to not have a daughter anymore, then you\u2019ve made the right decision for yourself.\n\nI need literal teenagers to stop with the pearl clutching in the comments.

When people are vile enough they don\u2019t get unconditional love. Would you say the same if your son cheated on his wife the entire time?", "Why is loving associated with wealth?", "She\u2019s not a good person. Anyone would be better without her! Her poor husband deserves to find a person with morals instead of this evil person.", "they are just calling him out on the hipocracy saying that he loves his daughter, but then proceeds to cut her of", "I agree. I want more background info on how and why Op\u2019s daughter was in this situation.", "what if he just doesnt want to be around someone that is capable of such lies and deciet over years?", "Would you say the same if a man cheated on his wife the entire time?", "He didn't pry; his daughter voluntarily admitted to it eventually.  He wasn't meddling in her marriage.  And why should it matter who she was cheating on?  She kept the ruse up for five years.  She wasted five years of someone's life to have her cake and eat it too.  For some people there are just some things you can't love through.  This is part of what happens when you make choices like cheating - you end up burning bridges behind you.", "To be clear, there isn't really any time lines (such as when this happened) to really make a determination on how long they've been NC. I can safely say if my brother (child free here) did something like this to my SIL or if my God kids did this to their SOs, I would probably be LC/NC with them for a while until I got over it because infidelity is something that is hard for EVERYONE to get over. But to remain NC for an extended period of time is also a dick move. I mean, it's his money to do as he wishes, but they definitely have a right to be NC as long as they need to get over something like this.\n\nEDITING TO ADD: My family has always treated infidelity as an end all/be all and is a super shameful act, especially within the bonds of marriage. That's just the way I was raised, so I understand. What I don't understand is completely cutting off your child over something like this because love isn't conditional. You can be a bit distant, but you don't cut off family for something like this.", "The daughter is a monster.", "So there's no way for her to redeem herself? I think that's a bit harsh. And there should be consequences, but this act itself does not include the father. By this logic, a parent should be able to disinherit their child because they're gay and consider the act immoral and consider taking away their inheritance as a consequence?\n\nAlthough, I mean it is OPs money and he can do what he wishes, but he also has to accept the consequences of HIS actions (not seeing grandchildren, child going NC, etc)", "She\u2019s a bad person.", "when someone dui and kills somebody at least you can say that this was not the norm. cheating on your housband throughout the whoe relationship over 5 years or more is a permanently concious decision for which you have to have a certain character to do that. \n\nwhile one crime is worse, the cheating tells more about the persons true colours id say", "What? I would definitely disown my child if they drove drunk and killed someone. That\u2019s not a mistake either. Drunk drivers are disgustingly selfish people.", "Yes you absolutely and 110% can.", "If I see a man kick a puppy, I'm allowed to cut him out of my life. Just because you are not the one being victimized, doesn't mean you have no say in the situation. \n\nBystanders are never innocent. And staying impartial to immoral acts ***is*** condoning those actions.", "Would you then say if the daughter was homophobic or racist he should still have a relationship with her? Given that he wouldn\u2019t be the subject of her homophobia or racism? If we are going down the road of it only matters if it directly effects me then is no one allowed to have a moral standard?", "Irrelevant. Are we judging OP\u2019s entire life decisions and his moral fiber here or this one act? NTA from me, simply because he has the right to write anyone he wants from his will.", "I agree that all cheating isn\u2019t the same and that OP is being over the top. \n\nUnfortunately this sub doesn\u2019t always possess that same nuance. There are so many scenarios where people just treat cheating to any extent that the cheater should be stoned to death. \n\nA bunch of different posts come to mind.", "Disinheritance and basically going no contact??", "I did not say the daughter wasn\u2019t wrong. Didn\u2019t even excuse her. \n\nI can say that these are the worst posts on Reddit and acknowledge that a 5 year affair is terrible. Two things can be true.", "Also been cheated on. \n\nWhat I have learned about relationships, is that although some people may be fortunate to have great examples of healthy ones, we don\u2019t actually *learn* how to navigate them until we\u2019re in them. Like obviously cheating is bad. \n\nBut unlike friendships, relationships are not really \u201ctaught.\u201d From a young age, we\u2019re taught how to be a good friend and a good person. But there are so many factors in relationships that can be so new for people to experience and deal with. \n\nLike cheating is not okay. But neither is being manipulative, controlling, jealous, and all the other things that make you a bad partner.", "I\u2019m going to keep repeating this.. \n\nI\u2019m not saying what she did was not wrong, and in this case I think jumping into a marriage and cheating from the start *is* one of the worst forms of cheating. \n\nBut I am saying that in general this sub treats all forms of cheating the same. And I still don\u2019t know if I would completely cut off my child because of something they did in a relationship. Express disappointment!? Absolutely. Need time away to process!? 100%. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know if I would go so far to make a change to the will. To me (putting aside the cheating and focusing on the will), when parents tout around inheritance money it presents as if they are trying to dictate their child\u2019s choices and show them their love is conditional if they continue to throw around will changes. \n\nIt\u2019s almost like a way to keep your child under your control even in adulthood. I want my children to have a good future regardless of their choices (barring some more extreme circumstances of course).", "It would have been more than that if they were married for 5 years.", "It\u2019s not about who\u2019s more important- it\u2019s about morals and what\u2019s right and wrong.\n\nStop screaming misogyny at everything since he stated he would disinherit his son as well.\n\nHis money should be his decision.", "I didn\u2019t even think about his wife and how he so casually made a life altering decision for her without her KNOWING. That\u2019s pretty gross behavior in itself.", "Lol you and your ilk always pull out the same buzzwords anytime there's a man that does something you dislike. Keep your misandry to yourself. Its quite clear that you're as devoid of a moral compass as OP's daughter is.", "You can just say you're not Christian. You don't have to bash someone's religion", "Manipulative to state the reality of using money to control someone's behavior? The reality is that doing this to his daughter will have real life consequences for his family's relationships and get togethers. Also, grandchildren are worth more than you're giving them credit for and they will also suffer knowing their grandpa cared more about his daughter's sex life than he did for them.", "Thankfully after this I doubt the OP will have a relationship with any future grandchildren from either of his kids. His wife disagrees with him and will hopefully ensure their son doesn't subscribe to his dad's view.", "I think he said they split finances but even if they do, his wife is likely to inherit his anyways and then split between her kids.", "my pleasure \u263a\ufe0f happy cake day!", "I can asking why you can't talk with yoir IL/BL/SL when you divorced? I mean, whe your relationship was good and the problem was your D/S.", "And are you telling me you'd give the same weight to a decision someone makes when they're 22 as you would to when they're 40? Of course not. So what does your point have to do with the price of tea in China?", "Correct. But it does inhibit your ability to understand consequences, especially permanent or long term consequences. Don't get me wrong, I've been victim to infidelity. I do not condone it. But OP is injecting his ego into this equation and being way too harsh to someone who got married at the age of 22.", "It's not a \"dumb excuse\" it's scientific fact. So, there's that little tidbit. Are you really going to tell me you look at a decision someone makes in their 20s and judge them the same as if they're in their 40s? Of course not. You already know that. I'll give you a perfect example. Two of my friends got DUIs last month. My first friend, we'll call him Jay, was 23. He's an idiot and made a bad decision, but do I think less of him? No. I too was a dumbass in my 20s and did plenty of dumb shit. That's what your twenties are for. My other friend, we'll call him Bob, just turned 40 when he got his first DUI this year. I ripped Bob a new asshole. I had no compassion. He is a 40 year old man. He knows better. And you would acknowledge the difference as well. Don't try and tell me it doesn't matter. People in their early 20s are idiots. Periodt", "What he says and his actions show that he doesn't. It's easy to SAY you love someone, but at first he wanted to BAN her from his house, now he lifted the ban but wants to be warned when she's coming over so he can not be there, shows he doesn't love her.", "I sure would. I would be disappointed but I would still love my child. Yall put cheaters and serial killers in the same categories and it's honestly weird to me.", "You can love someone and still cut them off. I love my mother but I had to because she was a bad person. This cheating daughter is also a bad person. She deserves to be cut off but he can still love her and still support the poor husband instead of her.", "Oh 100%!", "Of course not. The man should then deserve whatever hell or problems he is facing. Because somehow it\u2019s the man\u2019s fault for cheating and in a reverse situation where the wife cheats, it must be still his fault because \u2018no one cheats just because\u2019.", "I am not inheriting anything because I am trans. I stand by my point. No one is owed money just because you are blood related. \n\nIf she wants the money, she'll have to show she's changed. But only sucking up to relatives in hopes of recieving a reward once their dead is fucked up imo anyways.", "SHE CHEATED FOR FIVE YEARS", "His opinion might soften in the future, but why is it weird that her actions have consequences? By the way, cheating for 5 years is absolutely the ultimate judge of someone\u2019s character.", "So we can make life altering decisions about another humans beings life without them even knowing? We said cheating was wrong but wrong enough to never speak to something you selfishly created in the first place? Nah where is your moral compass it\u2019s pointing in the wrong direction.", "> you and your ilk \n\nMy ilk? Who would that be? Parents who love their children unconditionally, regardless of their gender? Or husbands who don't control whether their wife is allowed to interact with her own daughter? Your weird anger is really bizarre ~~dude~~ correction lady - just saw your bare tits and foot fetish posts. Either way probs should reflect on why that upset you so much.\n\nI give this comment 0/10, it's adding zero to the discussion and a lame attempt to troll.", "Wouldn\u2019t have misandry without misogyny except men don\u2019t get physically hurt when misandry is happening like women have. Gtfo misogynist.", "I'm not bashing your religion. That singular idea is absolutely absurd, regardless of what religion you are or aren't. You seriously trying to imply that, say, the sin of infidelity is equal to the sin of murder?", "I don't think it's bashing to suggest that stealing a loaf of bread is equivalent to murder. Both crimes, but perhaps a bit different in severity.", "that is what happed with my wife's parents", "Shit I hope when your loved one cheats on you and they probably do you\u2019re cool with it", "I'm not saying suck up, but a chance to redeem yourself. I'm gay and not receiving anything from my grandmother because of it. But as I said, immoral is a subjective term. I don't think we should be denied inheritances because we don't follow the viewpoints of our family or because we don't fit into their little box of what's normal when it doesn't necessarily affect them directly, but it is their money to do with as they wish. They just can't blame US for the CONSEQUENCES they place on us.", "I think consequences of \u201cI\u2019m taking you out the will,\u201d because his daughter is a terrible spouse is completely different than if she were to do something else. Even if the cheating was completely awful (which it was!!)\n\nAnd the fact that he felt so strongly that he changed a legal document (which I understand can he changed back at any moment), says a lot. It basically presents as, what the daughter did was so atrocious that if something were to happen with me right now I\u2019m okay with her not being take care of in the future and I\u2019m comfortable literally dying on this hill. \n\nIt would take an awful lot more for me to change a document like that.", "The dad didn't get cheated on. What a weird thing to say.", "Immoral is subjective, but infidelity is literally traumatic in longterm relationships. It can and often does fuck people up for years. This isn't like she accidentally let the dog loose outside or wore the wrong color dress to an event. She quite possibly messed this man up mentally and physically in a very real and lasting way.", "No I\u2019m saying that when you find out you\u2019re being cheated on you better be fine with it!", "Ok buddy. That's not this story. This father disowned his daughter for cheating on her husband. You can not condone someone's behavior and limit contact while still loving your child. The father acts like he got cheated on. And what a weird thing for you to wish on an internet stranger who said they wouldn't stop loving their child. Did your parents stop loving you or something because you're projecting big time. Anyway I'm gonna end this conversation here as you wish to be willfully obtuse. Enjoy your life.."]}
