He has a core group of friends at school who all live in the same neighborhood and gone to school together since preschool. They all have a love of pokemon with their own binders where they play against each other and trade cards.\nLast week my son was doing a last min trade with a friend and put his card binder in an outside pocket of his bookbag. He didn't realize it fell out as he was running to the bus until he got home. When he told me crying, I immediately called the school for lost and find and messaged the teacher. No luck.\nToday my son went to school sad but understood that it was his responsibility to watch out for his own stuff. At recess his friends pulled out their cards and \"J\" had one of my sons special edition cards. (These were some all black cards I got online that accidentally came in Spanish instead of English and my son loves them). When my son pointed it out J said he found a binder last week at school and was excited for the cool cards in it. He pulled the binder out of his bookbag and the other boys said that was my sons. J gave it back but my son noticed some empty spots of cards taken. He asked for them back but the kid claimed he never took any out. He saw more of his cards in J's hand but is Non confrontational and didn't press it.\nHe came home excited and told me the story. I messaged the mom of J and explained that there were some cards missing and listed the characters (my son is high functioning autistic and has a photographic memory). His mom brushed it off and said my son must be lying because her baby would never take things from other people. \nUnhappy with that response I walked down to her house and asked for the cards back. She refused and closed the door in my face. I tried to let it go but I'm petty and sent her a message that her son was no longer invited to my sons birthday party. She blew up our group mom text with how horrible I am for accusing her son of stealing and now not inviting her son to the party. Almost all the moms privately message me asking what is going on and I explain. They ask their boys who all corroborate my story. \nCome to find out this is not the first time he has taken stuff and has even stolen from his friends at slumber parties.\nMost agree that I am making the right move to not let a thief in my house, but 2 other moms say I am horrible to not invite him since he is only 9 and doesn't know better. I told my sister about it and she said it was cruel to not invite him when all their other friends will be there. Now I am doubting if I made the right call.\n\nJust to add: I go overboard for my kids birthday parties. We rent bouncy houses, stuffing station, I set up games, cook tons of food and always have adult beverages. Our parties go well after bedtime where the boys crash in a fort in my living room and us parents enjoy a firepit.\n\nUpdate: I took some advice for you awesome commentors and called J's mom. I told her her son can come to the party if he returns the cards. She lost it on me still saying her son didn't take anything. She said she doesn't want to go to my \"shitty party\". I told her the offer still stands and hung up.\n\nWhen talking to my son he wants J to come so he doesn't feel left out. He said he has his favorite ones so J can just keep the ones he took. I decided to let this go especially in front of my son. His name is also now in huge letters on the cover of the binder. Since it is a double zipper binder I am thinking of getting a cute little number lock for it\n\nUpdate #2: need to clarify that when I said I was letting this go I meant more in not talking about it especially around my son. J is not allowed in my house. The only exception is if he returns the cards he can come to the party.\nSince we live in the same subdivision our kids are around each other a lot.", "created_utc": 1678743661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qmq6r/aita_for_banning_a_kid_from_my_sons_birthday/", "score": 340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At least until he\u2019s in the back of a police car just a couple of short years from now.

I have a friend who owns a local game store and if we get any online he confirms if they are real or not. If they are fake I mark them with a black star.

Helicopter parenting is far too prevalent in our society and it\u2019s hurting our kids. Parents shouldn\u2019t get involved. Kids need to work this out on their own.

By secretly talking to other parents and maligning this CHILD for doing this, you are outcasting him. His mother was upset?  Of course!  Look maybe her kid took the cards, but the bigger wrong is you making a HUGE deal of it by putting this kid in the community spotlight. He\u2019s probably embarrassed of what he did already and that\u2019s why he won\u2019t come forward. We\u2019ve all stolen crap as kids.
