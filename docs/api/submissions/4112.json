You are right to keep it to yourself should you wish to start posting again.\n\nYou are also right to keep it out of your brothers girlfriends hands.

People pay good money for accounts plus yours has real followers and not bots. I'd charge her about $5K for the account if she really wants it.", "Of course NTA but I'm more hung up on the fact those followers followed your instagram for an art related reason. Her arguments are based on a notion that a follower is a follower despite the context. Fuck that. If I followed someone for their art, then years later it's some snot nosed kid flossing and dabbing I'd be like, \"what the fuck is happening?\"", "NTA. She has no right to anyone else\u2019s account, not to mention that it would be rude to your followers.

Type 1 are bots. Bots are annoying and add no value. Type 2 are real live people. They have their own likes and dislikes. We do not gift people to each other. We do not sell people to each other.
