I managed to get a little over 35k followers at one point but it has since drop to 30k as it has been inactive for sometime as a little over 3 years ago I lost interested in it and stop using it.  I haven't logged in over 2 years\n\nThe issue is with my brothers 29 girlfriend Katie 26 whois a wanna be influencers.  She has about 6000s followers. But act like it's a lot more \n\n\nIt all started at our little sister (11) birthday. \n\n\nI took a picture with my little sister and went to post it on my personal Instagram. Which only has about 62 followers.\n\nIt's a account is private and my followers are all family and friends.\n\nKatie see me and make a comment about how I should build my brand more.\n\nMy little sister who dislike Katie was standing next to me. Brought up my art account and how I have more then Katie on it. \n\nKatie look confused. And ask what she meant so I explain about my old art account.\n\nKatie ask to see it so I show her the account. \n\nKatie gave me a weird look and walked away and I thought that was that. \n\nThe next day she was over at my parents again.

It's my account whether I use it or not. \n\nHe then accused  me of doing this to pick on katie and also accused me of showing her the page to rub it in her faces. \n\nHe calls me the asshole for keeping the account when I know how much Katie want to have a following \n\nI told him that I made the account I build the following and I decided what to do with it.\n\nNow's he mad at me because Katie won't stop complaining and she making his life hell.

This is so stupid. It\u2019s your account. You built it. If she took it over, she\u2019d lose all those followers because it\u2019s not a numbers game, it\u2019s about content. Your brother and his gf are morons", "Oh hell NTA\n\nIs Katie entitled to your christmas present if it is something she REALLY wants (since, like she learned that the thing in question existed) and you might exchange it anyway?   \nWhy not your paycheck, not like you use all of it anyway, right?\n\nIf Katie thinks that her wanting something somehow warrents any sort of obligation on other people, she needs to grow up and smell all the sand she's going to be told to go pound. And your brother seriously needs to stop enabling that behavior.\n\nShe wants a following? Okay, build on. Be interesting. Maybe she is lacking followers because her personality is about as interesting as a wet newpaper from yesterday.", "NTA. Tell her to post better content and work harder to grow her brand. That\u2019s basically what she said to you, she should take her own advice.", "NTA, your followers followed you for a reason, you earned them. If you old account starts promoting other things \u201cinfluencer\u201d based then those followers have been \u201cbait and switched\u201d.", "NTA just like you said you might wanna start posting art one day and plus they are not entitled to anything. They can go and screw themselves", "NTA. Your brother needs to dump this fool.", "NTA. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a real following because she\u2019s fake and Unlikable. It would just dwindle away anyway because people wanted art not Pseudo celebrity wannabe.", "Tell her that giving away your IG account is not in line with your brand. After all, you're a creative person, unlike her.\n\nNTA", "You should post on that account just to spite her! NTA", "NTA.  I don't think she's cut out to be an influencer, she can't even successfully influence you. The facts are:\n\n1. your followers will ditch her once she reactivates the account and starts spamming them with content that is different than what they signed up for\n2. even though the account is inactive now, you may want to reactivate it in the future\n3. if she takes the account and pisses off your followers, it will negatively affect your own reputation--EVEN IF she's upfront about being a different person.\n\nI know we like to be anti-influencer on reddit as if it's a fake job, but it takes hard work to build up and retain a following in the face of constant competition and changing trends. Overnight followers are not the answer to Katie's problems.  Continuing to do the things that netted her the first 6k on her own account are.", "NTA\u2026 Look into turning on two factor authentication. No sense making it an easy target for theft.", "I would be beyond pissed if I had followed an artist because I like their work and one day I suddenly started receiving notifications for a bunch of crap from someone wanting to be an \"influencer\"\n\nDon't do it. You may not want to use it now but you can change your mind in the future and your name as an artist will have been ruined on that platform.\n\nIf the girlfriend isn't interesting enough to get more followers that's her problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I mean I don\u2019t have the crayons or patience to explain to Katie or your brother that even if you did hand over your account as soon as your followers saw her content they would literally unfollow her basic ass.", "NTA. She\u2019s not entitled to anything you have or made, and it\u2019s weird she thinks she does. If you liked a pair of her shoes she hadn\u2019t worn in awhile, would she be an asshole if she didn\u2019t give them to you?", "\"he gets mad and talks about how its not fair\"\n\nNot fair?  Man, the nerve on some people.  Keep the account.  NTA  100%\n\n\"Now's he mad at me because Katie won't stop complaining and she making his life hell. I now wonder if maybe I'm the asshole here.\"\n\nPray they don't marry.  She will tell him to demand that you give her everything you own that she likes.  Good lord, and good luck.", "NTA. If ask her for $30k or whatever to give it up. That's was your labor. Something you created. Can't pay? Too bad. So sad. Entitled ass", "Definitely NTA\n\nShe hasn't done anything, why the hell should you just give it to her for no reason.  I'd tell her that you'd be willing to sell it to her for the right price and see what she comes back with.  \n\nShe seems pretty conceited and entitled, your brother should seriously consider if she is the type of person he wants to be with.", "This is a very entertaining read!  \n\nYou are NTA!\n\nKatie seems like a needy little nitwit.  Under no circumstances should you gift her your Instagram account.  What would she do with it?  It's YOUR artwork and YOUR own brand that you built up.  Both she and your brother are being immature wankers.  \n\nShe's lazy.  She's unwilling to put in the work to build up her own following. She's entitled.  Hopefully your brother sees this and dumps her sorry ass very soon.  It seems miserable to be with her.", "It's pretty funny that she was trying to give you advice on how to build a brand on Instagram - as if everybody even cares about that.  She sounds condescending up until the point where she discovers that she has a fraction of the followers that you have.  Then she just sounds like a jealous twit.  I'm shocked that you didn't regurgitate her own snotty advice back to her.", "NTA. She has a warped sense of entitlement and your brother has no spine.", "NTA If she wants it so bad ask her to pay 50,000 for it since it is a business with a following. Ask her how is she going to use an art account, since she isnt an artist she is a wannabe insta model. Don't give in keep your account tell her you've started using it again.", "NTA. She should take her own advice and work on building her brand. If you decide to start posting again make sure to share the name with all of us so we can all follow you and build your numbers even more. Or share it now (if you\u2019re comfortable doing that) and let\u2019s put you back at 35K", "NTA\n\nIt is your account which you built a following up from posting your art. You are right to keep it to yourself should you wish to start posting again.\n\nYou are also right to keep it out of your brothers girlfriends hands. She needs to learn how to build a following herself rather than just grabbing someone elses followers. SHe sounds very entitled and the fact she is still going on about it  and trying to turn your brother against you is a bit of a red flag to me.", "Nta and the only way her asking could make any sense is if she was also posting art but even then she\u2019s not entitled to the account", "Absolutely **NTA**. Can't believe she had the audacity to ask (worse, to DEMAND), and your brother still defends her... tell them to f\\* off!!", "Cut contact with them and the complaining will stop  No is a complete sentence", "NTA\n\nBut honestly you haven't used in it in two years- tell her to pay you for it. People pay good money for accounts plus yours has real followers and not bots. I'd charge her about $5K for the account if she really wants it.", "Of course NTA but I'm more hung up on the fact those followers followed your instagram for an art related reason. Her arguments are based on a notion that a follower is a follower despite the context. Fuck that. If I followed someone for their art, then years later it's some snot nosed kid flossing and dabbing I'd be like, \"what the fuck is happening?\"", "NTA. She has no right to anyone else\u2019s account, not to mention that it would be rude to your followers. The followed and art account, not a whiny entitled wannabe influencer.", "Nta but if they keep it up make a video of you permanently deleting said account & say problem solved.", "NTA, and she clearly doesn\u2019t actually understand how to build a brand on social media. If she takes it over and starts posting her own content, she\u2019ll haemorrhage followers who are expecting your art \u2013 and probably be reported as a hacker or spam to boot. Followers aren\u2019t just numbers to be counted, they\u2019re actual people too.", "Has nobody explained things very slowly so Katie can understand? \n\nThere are 2 kinds of followers. Type 1 are bots. Bots are annoying and add no value. Type 2 are real live people. They have their own likes and dislikes. We do not gift people to each other. We do not sell people to each other. If you want people to be interested in your content, then you have to post content that interests them. If you want something, work hard and earn it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
