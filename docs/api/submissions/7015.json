It was very sad but a nice memorial service, and afterwards we drove back to my friend's mom's house for what was described as a \"light lunch.\"  There were finger sandwiches, crackers, cheese slices, some tuna, and a veggie plate.  The plates were small because the assumption was that each guest would take a few things from each tray and then sit down and quietly eat.  But my stomach was growling, and I was expected to be at this lunch for at least a few hours.\n\nI piled my plate high with finger sandwiches, crackers, cheese, vegetables, and some hummus and sat down.  I ate very quickly and didn't look up while devouring my food.  When I finally did look up, my friend and his family had hardly touched their food and had a mix of disgust and sadness on their faces, as though they could hardly eat because they were so grief-stricken.  I was now full and my stomach stopped growling, but my friend pulled me aside and said that I was a real jerk and displayed disgusting table manners for eating like that, especially after his dad's funeral.\n\nI apologized but explained to him that I worked out earlier that morning and was famished, and it would have been even more rude to have skipped lunch and gone to Chipotle or something like that.  He told me that if food was so important to me, perhaps I should have gone to Chipotle and left his family alone to reflect quietly and eat a few celery sticks or whatever.  His explanation honestly didn't make much sense to me.  The food was there and some would have spoiled if someone hadn't eaten it.\n\nNow, I keep asking if he wants to hang out, and he keeps ignoring my texts.  I keep trying to apologize, but I'm getting really tired of being ignored.

Obviously you made a spectacle of yourself if everyone was staring at you with disgusted looks on their faces and your friend was upset. It was a funeral lunch, you should have been more discreet.", "YTA for not being aware of the emotional context while you were eating. \n\nI get how seeing you be completely mindless of that would offend your friend. \n\nYou had time to workout earlier that day, but did anything stop you from eating between that and the funeral?", "You could have sated your hunger without wolfing down your food and making a scene during your friend's grieving time. YTA.", "YTA, not for eating but for the way you ate. From the sound of it you loaded up a plate and then scarfed everything down without even paying attention to what was going on around you. If you had gotten some food, nibbled on it while interacting with those around you, and refilled your plate as necessary, it would have been a lot more inconspicuous.", "YTA. It\u2019s rude to eat large amounts of food in any light lunch buffet setting, but doing so at a funeral was even more inappropriate. You can wait for an appropriate time to get a proper lunch.", "You could have slowly eaten a lot throughout the time you're there and not gobbled down a shit ton of food within a few minutes. That is displaying awful manners, and I see why they'd find it inappropriate in a time of grieving (It could even be considered that in any setting). You also knew you had to go to the funeral and chose not to eat but to work out instead. Yeah, I'm going to give you a YTA here. Being hungry is understandable. Eating the food that is there is reasonable. But displaying 0 manners and awareness is neither understandable nor reasonable.", "YTA\n\nBased on the information you provided it sounds like you live in an area/have a culture that's similar to mine regarding funerals. You were rude.\n\nThe family is experiencing a loss, and while everyone grieves differently, there's certain etiquette around funerals. If the family is eating a light lunch which THEY'VE provided, you eat light, too. You can get food later. Also, I highly doubt the food would have spoiled. Your friend's family isn't going to want to think about buying food or cooking for a while. I imagine friends will bring more food over for them and any food left after the lunch would be eaten later. \n\nAnd I'm imagining your friend didn't take your apology as genuine because they probably sensed that you don't think you did anything wrong.", "YTA. Seriously? You could have grabbed a similar amount of food as everyone else and discreetly gone back for seconds after the others had taken some food. You should\u2019ve had a big breakfast, you planned poorly", "Seems like Chipotle would have been the best option, OP. I never condemn anyone eating a lot at a funeral because that\u2019s what we do in our culture, but that\u2019s not what happened here. YTA. You should have read the room. There was little food to go around, and the mood was somber. You\u2019ve really made it all about yourself here, your workout and your hunger, when there were people in mourning. Including your best friend!", "Yta - in this case, eat a little, just enough to stop the tummy rumbles, then afterwards, go find more food.", "YTA\u2014 I understand you were hungry but the polite thing is to plan so you don\u2019t overeat at such things\u2014eating breakfast or packing a snack. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect an all you can eat buffet at a funeral, at least no funeral I\u2019ve attended. And it sounds like you ate like a starving stray\u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine you were really so hungry you had to shovel so fast you don\u2019t even look up. \n\nIf you really need to eat much more than everyone else takes, take a reasonable plate, go eat it politely, and after everyone has had first servings, go back for seconds. \n\nI don\u2019t think the family would have noticed or objected if you had eaten a lot but shown an awareness of others getting a share and of people watching you. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m still humiliated that my ex\u2019s family gorged themselves at my wedding buffet leaving people at the end of the line to find the food all gone. They probably could have gone back for a third or fourth serving if they had waited to go up after everyone had a single serving, but instead 6 jerks got 10 servings each and some got none.", "**YTA**, and you need better home training. I really hope you're a teenager, because if you're any older than that . . . \n\nLook, it wasn't a party, your friend and his family weren't hosting you for a holiday meal, and you don't seem to have any situational awareness at all.\n\nWhen a \"light lunch\" or other minimal catering is provided at a visitation after a funeral, it's usually for two reasons: 1) to try to encourage the grief-stricken family members to eat a little bit by putting easy-to-grab food right at their fingertips, because otherwise they're going to be too distracted and upset, and forget to feed themselves; and 2) to give mourners/visitors something to hold and nibble on, to help mitigate the awkwardness. It lets people hold a plate in their hands when otherwise not know where to put them. It lets them snack on something when no one knows what to say but they want to be present for the people they love, so the lack of conversation seems less weird. It's not meant for you to chow down on like you haven't eaten a meal in days.\n\nAnd there are MEANT to be leftovers, so that the mourners have food (along with things that people bring) over the next several days, and don't have to worry about cooking for themselves - this provides easy sandwich fixing, etc. for them. Nothing was going to go to waste. No one needed you to eat it all. Jesus. \n\nLook, if you were THAT hungry, you should have gone through a drive-through between the funeral and the visitation and grabbed a quick bite in your car. What you did was rude, thoughtless, but most importantly your whole attitude about this is completely self-absorbed. The fact that you're still complaining about your supposed BEST FRIEND, WHO JUST LOST HIS DAD TO CANCER, being upset with you, and acting like he wronged you because he was appalled by your behaviour at HIS DAD'S VISITATION . . . just yikes. Do you even understand what friendship is? YTA, and massively so.", "YTA.  You were there to support your friend.  If you worked out in the morning you should have planned time to eat more before the funeral.  And since you didn\u2019t plan ahead the least you could have done was be subtle and eat a little at a time or eat out of view of the most bereaved people. By your own admission you piled your plate high and devoured it without even looking up.  Your best friend was at his lowest and all you could think about was your stomach instead of his suffering. Apologize and see what you can do to be there for him in the future.", "YTA? Idk, you'll get different responses as everyone will see this differently. But to me:\n\nif you're stacking your plate high and eating like it's the last thing you'll ever have then cmon... everyone grieving and you're in the background face down just devouring food.\n\nIt comes across as rude.\n\n\nAt these things you want to grab a little something, but go around and offer your condolences to the grieving family.", "YTA. You broke the normal rules of all buffet set ups, and that is to take all of the food before anyone else can get their fair share, not to mention the appalling lack of table manners/decorum. It would have been best for you to get a small sampling of the buffet, and then, once a respectful time has passed, offer your condolences again and then go to town at Chipotle.", "YTA\n\nYou could have planned better and had some snacks ready to have after your workout. \n\n**The plates were small because the assumption was that each guest would take a few things from each tray and then sit down and quietly eat.**\n\nSo you knew what you SHOULD do.\n\n**I piled my plate high with finger sandwiches, crackers, cheese, vegetables, and some hummus and sat down. I ate very quickly and didn't look up while devouring my food.**\n\nAnd didn't do it. You could have eaten the same amount of food but done so a little more respectfully.\n\nThat being said your friend may have overreacted a little bit because he's grieving.", "Are you sure they weren\u2019t upset because they couldn\u2019t afford a lot of food and you ate way more than your fair share?  You acknowledge that they had small plates so guests didn\u2019t take much.\n\nIt was 100% your choice to work out instead of eating before the service.\n\nSoft YTA because You acknowledge that they had small plates so guests didn\u2019t take much; then you took a ton of food.", "YTA. You could have taken a normal amount and not piled your plate high - once you ate that and everyone e else has been to the table you could go and get more - you wouldn\u2019t have upset a friend. You don\u2019t say whether there was enough food for everyone sonI\u2019ll assume there was. \n\nYou must see how this looks to your friend - your stomach is more important than they are. It was crass and insensitive and you owe them an apology. This is not how anyone is supposed to behave at a buffet.", "YTA. You sound extremely young. I hope you will never truly understand the grief your friend is going through, but damn, I hope you at least learn that the only decent thing to do after a funeral is awkwardly nibble at the offerings.", "YTA.\n\nYou seem to lack basic social awareness and human decency.", "YTA. Have you even asked your friend how he is feeling? He just lost his dad. He is grieving. The way you described the funeral shows that you thought of this as an obligation and inconvenience, not as an opportunity to give comfort to your friend and his family. \n\nYou scarfing down the food wouldn\u2019t have been so offensive if you showed some empathy toward your friend. He might have even laughed it off. I suggest you try apologizing for your poor manners, talking to him on a deeper level, rather than just asking to hang out.", "YTA \n\nYou weren't wrong for being hungry but from what you write it seems like you both disregarded etiquette as far as how much of the communal food to take, but also in your table manners at a particularly sensitive time. The point of the event wasn't to \"eat lunch\". \n\nIf you were that hungry, you should have hit a drive-through on your way and bolted down a burger or two in the car, or as he said if you couldn't handle the proper etiquette for the event, just not go and eat instead.", "YTA. \n\nYou should have just apologized, full stop. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinking\u201d\n\nInstead you \u201capologized\u201d and continue to defend why you did that. And you bring up going to Chipotle??\n\nLike that\u2019s your best friend. It\u2019s the day of his dads funeral. Your job, was to be there to support your friend. Who cares if it was rude or not? Your BEST friend thought it was rude and it was his FATHERS funeral. \n\nEven now  it seems like you\u2019re just thinking about yourself. How you\u2019re tired of being ignored.", "YTA.   \nYou would not have died from a light lunch. Your actions were rude and inconsiderate. You were so noticeably hob-gobbling your food down that you drew attention and distracted the point of the funeral. Eating like that is bad manners and in a funeral situation that is this sad (your BF's dad whom I'm assuming died young based on the way you speak), it shows a disinterest and lack of empathy for those around you.   \nMan, the more I wrote it out, the more I got disgusted by your actions...yes YTA", "yta ... why didnt you drive somewhere and pick something up on the way to the house", "YTA. It\u2019s just weird man. You have a responsibility to feed yourself. They had a light lunch planned. You devoured and were gluttonous. Of course they\u2019re feeling you were insensitive. You should have eaten before hand or eaten in moderation, but you took more than your fair share and were weird about it", "YTA.  Your actions showed your friend that supporting him was a chore, just another chore you had to do that day.  You put the onus of caring for you (feeding you) on the grieving family, it should be the other way around, you should be trying to help them and encouraging them to eat and keep up their strength.\n\nIf something is described as a \"light lunch\" go through a drive through on your way over.", "Yta. The proper protocol is the eat a portioned amount and allow everyone else a chance to eat. Then if you would like one more portioned amount you go back. Keep a damn granola bar in your purse if your hunger makes you act this way", "YTA. Show up. Eat a few bites and then if your tumbly rumbles, get your own damn food workout boy.", "YTA. It\u2019s rude to pile up your plate and gorge yourself the way you did.", "YTA. You couldn't cut your workout short and get a bite to eat beforehand? It's a FUNERAL for your FRIEND'S DAD, maybe put others before yourself on this occasion? I'm pretty sure your tummy growling isn't nearly as painful as losing a father...\n\nYou acted inappropriately. Do not try to defend your actions further as it will just make you more of an ass. Apologize to your friend.", "You're an adult.  You could've eaten something at home prior to going to the funeral.\n\nYTA", "You're defo TA. Have some manners man, it's a funeral not a birthday party.", "YTA, I cannot believe you don't understand your friends explanation and I cannot understand you were dumb enough to not have something to eat before the funeral. If you could work out, then how could you not get food before going there. This was your friend's father's funeral. That may mean nothing to you, but your friend sure could have used your support. Instead you just came for the free lunch. Not cool!", "YTA.  You worked out.  Assume you had time to shower before going.  You had time to eat something first.", "YTA, it's rude and disrespectful to shovel food in your mouth like a caveman especially after a funeral. Being hungry is not an excuse to completely forget your manners.", "YTA. You had so many options but decided to act like a rabid animal who hadn't seen food in 2 weeks. Based on how you described yourself eating here, you could have gone to Chipotle, eaten 2 burritos and been 5 minutes behind everyone else. And then not embarrassed yourself acting like you are feral.", "YTA for these reasons:\n\n1. You were explicitly told you were in for a light lunch. It's a self serve. You serve yourself significantly more than is expected, and you imply you knew what you were doing by explaining that you were \"famished.\"\n2. You were at a solemn event commemorating a close one's *death.* Nothing, within reason, should take away the focus from this purpose, especially if you aren't a personal friend or family of the deceased. The food was not the focus of the ceremony in any way, and by eating a lot of food very quickly, *without looking up*, you've made a scene and taken away focus from the deceased and interrupted other's grieving process. Even if you were this hungry and *not* at a funeral, this would be pretty gross behavior in public.\n3. You went to a funeral right after working out. Was it your first time working out? Did you not expect to be this hungry afterwards? Funerals usually are scheduled on a certain date, so you likely didn't have a last-minute invitation. You could've packed a meal knowing you might be hungry, but you didn't. You could've not worked out that morning, knowing you had an important event afterwards. You did none of these things.\n4. When your friend, who is *grieving their father*, confronts you for your behavior, you don't just apologize, but explain yourself. You're essentially communicating point 3 to your friend, and by extension, that you didn't care enough to either plan ahead or not work out.\n\nFor future reference, if you *know* you will need to eat an exorbitant amount of food very quickly, it is *totally okay* to excuse yourself after the funeral and before the lunch, making it clear to your friend that you aren't feeling well (which might not even be a lie). You can come back to the lunch after eating, making it clear that they are important to you and that you want to be there to support them.\n\nPlus, as a fellow quick eater and a bit of a glutton, a good trick for eating with others is to try to match both how much they're serving themselves, and paying attention to how quickly they're eating. If you serve yourself first and aren't sure how much to serve yourself, always underestimate a bit of what you think might be acceptable. If you find they're eating way too slowly for your pace, take a sip of a drink and contribute to the conversation before the next bite. If you're still hungry after that, you can serve yourself again and more or less keep that speed. I guarantee you will be full whilst having eaten less, as you would've started digestion by the time you're done.", "I understand where you're coming from. I do intermittent fasting, and when it's time to eat, I am pretty damn hungry.\n\nN T A for eating a healthy amount, but it sounds like your table manners were a bit lacking. Mild YTA for going heads down and just devouring the food without looking up. In the future, I think the general recommendation is to get a normal sized amount of food, eat it politely, and then, IF everyone has already had a chance to get some, go back for a second reasonably sized plate. The piled- high crazy plate and the act of wolfing it down is a bit AHish. But it's not a huge faux pas. Honestly they sound like they overreacted a bit, but that's understandable given their grief.", "Info: did everyone else already eat a serving before you piled your plate?", "YTA.    Eat breakfast", "YTA. Why were you even there? That was so rude. \n\nThe most you could have done was go for 2-3 servings discreetly rather than 1 giant plate. \n\nI would be pissed too and would rather you have just head off after the memorial for a bite and then come back.", "Your hunger was more important to you than your friend's grief. You went for the food apparently, not the support.\n\nYTA.", "NTA for eating, but a bit of an A for the way you went about it. You could've just taken a few rounds of each item over some time and not made it gross by piling food up. Maybe you just made it sound gross, otherwise I don't see an issue. I'd be happy if guests ate and enjoyed their meal regardless of occasion", "YTA. You write as though your hunger was something completely out of your control. Are you incapable of feeding yourself? You could have had an extra granola bar after the gym. Mix up a protein shake in a shaker bottle and drink it on your way to the memorial service. Heck, you might have even had the foresight to skip your morning workout and do it in the evening that day instead. Why were your only options to skip the lunch or eat like a pig?", "What is wrong with you. If you worked out, you should have planned to bring a post work out meal? \n\nIt's a funeral, no one wants to watch you shovel shit into your face, your only job is to be there to support THEM. \n\nYTA.", "YTA I wouldn't want to hang out with you after that either", "YTA. You, from your own description, acted greedy and uncouth.\n\nIf you had time to work out, you had time to eat.\n\nYou could have taken a normal amount and gone back for seconds.\n\nYou were there to commiserate on a loss, not stuff your maw in a corner.", "If your behavior at a funeral is upsetting to the grieving family you need to apologize.

If you were just looking for a free lunch you should have skipped it.\n\nYour justification about it going bad is moronic. There *should* have been extra food at the end for the grieving family to take home.", "NAH but to make sure everyone has an opportunity to eat, only fill the plate (don\u2019t pile it sky high), and make multiple trips if you\u2019re still hungry.\n\nAlso, that food is usually considered to be for the family to have to eat on for a few days while they\u2019re grieving. So maybe you may be lightly TA.", "I need to see the video of how you eat to judge. Just next time eat slower and consider this a lesson of manners at the table. Looks like you maybe lacking somewhere. NTA for being hungry, but eat slower and consider other people at the table.", "YTA. \n\nYou are an adult and should have been able to manage to either eat breakfast beforehand, pack snacks to eat in the car, take ten minutes between the funeral home and the mother's house to get some fast food before arriving, or wait until after the \"light lunch\" to eat more. Instead, you prioritized a workout and not eating before the funeral.\n\nAfter the funeral, you chose to hoard and devour a bunch of finger foods on your plate, without even glancing up, like a ravenous wild animal, causing such a ruckus that everyone was disgusted by your behavior. Instead of eating slowly, socializing and empathizing with the bereaved and going back for seconds (once everyone had gotten some). \n\nThen you further to go on to justify it by claiming that cheese, crackers, and vegetables would have somehow expired within hours so it's a good thing you scarfed them down? Hell no. You're rude as hell and I wouldn't want you around. \n\nAlso, to add on that you don't like being ignored at the end, by your friend grieving his dead father? Maybe he's not ready to hangout, especially not with someone with no manners. You really have no empathy at all for your (soon to be former) friend.\n\nETA: Your words \"and I had to attend the funeral\" just leave a sour taste in my mouth.

It was very sad but a nice memorial service, and afterwards we drove back to my friend's mom's house for what was described as a \"light lunch.\"  There were finger sandwiches, crackers, cheese slices, some tuna, and a veggie plate.  The plates were small because the assumption was that each guest would take a few things from each tray and then sit down and quietly eat.  But my stomach was growling, and I was expected to be at this lunch for at least a few hours.\n\nI piled my plate high with finger sandwiches, crackers, cheese, vegetables, and some hummus and sat down.  I ate very quickly and didn't look up while devouring my food.  When I finally did look up, my friend and his family had hardly touched their food and had a mix of disgust and sadness on their faces, as though they could hardly eat because they were so grief-stricken.  I was now full and my stomach stopped growling, but my friend pulled me aside and said that I was a real jerk and displayed disgusting table manners for eating like that, especially after his dad's funeral.\n\nI apologized but explained to him that I worked out earlier that morning and was famished, and it would have been even more rude to have skipped lunch and gone to Chipotle or something like that.  He told me that if food was so important to me, perhaps I should have gone to Chipotle and left his family alone to reflect quietly and eat a few celery sticks or whatever.

My husband said, \"How can you sit there and eat like that?\"  My son said, \"I'm hungry!\"  I wasn't bothered by it in the least, and I loved my FIL very much.  And of course a teenager eats like he's starving 24/7, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour friend is being unreasonable, but you should cut him some slack because he is grieving.  Still, you are NTA.", "YTA.  You piled your plate and scarfed down your food.  That's bad manners anywhere, let alone a funeral. You should take some, eat it *normally* then take some more if you are still hungry.", "Info: Do you like subs?", "I bet OP would get along great with the guy who ate an entire party sub by himself at a party", "Yup YTA. You should\u2019ve gotten a reasonable amount of food then waited till everyone what a chance then gone up for seconds. It\u2019s common courtesy.", "So you couldn\u2019t have just eaten a couple of things to tide you over until later? YTA", "NTA, when serving food at a funeral or wedding always expect some people to eat as much as they can.\n\nMaybe you ate too noisily or enthusiastically but it's not worth complaining over. Nor the sulky silent treatment. More likely the family are grieving and you make a convenient outlet for dumping all their pain & rage onto. \n\nMy uncle died suddenly and I was shocked,he was the only reasonably behaved relative I had. His funeral involved too many unpleasant faces from the past and the atmosphere was terrible. Quite a few of the guests & their despicable plus ones were eating as if they had been starved for a month and a few were obviously trying to bait reactions from people that they had a history of animosity towards on dietary or socio-cultural grounds. I didn't eat anything and pretended to be blind & deaf to all the insulting comments, obvious baiting and passive aggressive exchanges. If my uncle had dropped by in spirit, he would have been laughing at their toxic idiocy- as he did in life. \n\nDon't contact your friend again and have no contact with his relatives. He is grieving and needs to process his emotions so that he can move on in a positive way. \n\nIf he wants to meetup or get in contact with  you, he will do so in his own time.", "[deleted]", "ESH. You were hungry, the food was there, and you ate. Devouring a huge plate of food was probably not in the best of taste, but it didn't detract from the other people's grief. If they were so grief stricken that they couldn't really eat, you did no harm. And your friend was also in poor taste by begrudging you the food.", "NTA.", "NTA. don't know where the funeral took place, but they can ALL COLLECTIVLEY KICK ROCKS.", "NTA\n\nI don't see why people are making a big deal over this. Its usually around 2pm for my first meal of the day. If you are going to get mad at me for eating food, then why even offer it in the first place? Food has always been a big part of the memorial services that I have attended, and I have gorged myself there along with the family. They seem a bit oversensitive. If you don't want people eating, then don't even invite them to eat.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. In my area, mercy lunches after a funeral are very much a tradition. Everyone is invited and welcome to eat as much or as little as they wish. When my daughter passed away in late 2021, I hosted a gathering for anyone who wanted to come, and I was very preoccupied with thanking people for coming, and accepting their condolences. I took absolutely no notice of who ate what or how much. \n\nIf anything, the people policing your plate were being rude. Interesting how these grief-stricken people still found they could bear to take their minds off their departed loved one to be the lunch sheriffs. You were fine.", "Oh my GOD, I thought that said that OP worked early morning. Not worked OUT. Wow, OP, learn how to plan and manage your time better. Have a protein shake or bar after after your work out, don\u2019t expect to gorge yourself for your gaaaainz at a funeral.", "Yeah, I get the sense that table manners may have been the bigger issue here.", "And you just devoured it without even looking up! Good grief! YTA.", "Buffet weddings are common by me and I hate them for that reason.", "That's what really makes this a \"YTA\" moment for me. OP's own description shows that they understood the operative social expectation and willingly disregarded it.\n\nThis clearly wasn't a case of \"I didn't understand\" but rather one of \"I didn't care\".", "I don't think this was a woman. But yes, keep a granola bar on your person, or other snacks in a bag in your car. Especially if you become a ravenous animal who greedily devours everything in sight without looking up when hungry.", "Everyone took the food they wanted (which wasn't much), but they barely ate anything after sitting down.  There was plenty of food left after I got my plateful.", "If people noticed, it was likely gross.", "Sometimes reading the room is important. If they've put on a big spread, by all means, dig in. If it's just appetizers, take the hint that eating lunch isn't the focus.", "Yes, in my culture, we have a get-together after the burial,and the translation is \" corps feast.\"\nIt is very traditional, and attendees eat,drink, and reminisce. There's laughter and crying. Death is part of life.", "Lol, It ain't a funeral without cheesy potatoes and ham on buns.", "To have leftovers for the grieving family. Whatever is culturally appropriate at a funeral for you is fine, but this clearly upset the family, so it was not appropriate. Not every culture has the same perception of what is appropriate. Rather than assuming that your personal experience applies to everyone, listen when people say that they have been hurt by your actions.", "That's just it though. You have to read the room. At an event like this, you take your cues from those around you and from OP's own description, they fully realized the tenor of the event wasn't to eat like they were going to the chair.\n\nA different funeral might have had different etiquette expectations.", "OP was rude in the way she went about eating.  If she had socialized while eating, and going back for more instead of piling her plate high, she would have been less noticeable and more polite.  Scarfing a huge plate of food in the corner is what makes her TA.", "It may come as a shock but different people, different cultures,even different circumstances have different grieving.\n\nSomething appropriate in one circumstance can be inappropriate in another.", "Where did they say op is a woman?", "Yeah, people don\u2019t typically tend to throw food back like it\u2019s a full meal after a funeral. And leftovers are typically a good thing. So the grieving wife and children don\u2019t have to prepare meals in the days after the funeral. \n\nI mean, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily an AH but it was a tacky and thoughtless move. Next time, plan your day better.\n\nETA: actually, the more I think about it, YTA. Plan your day better and learn some manners. Give your friend some space to grieve and then apologize, sincerely. When he\u2019s ready to hear it.", "They call it Comfort Food for a reason", "To add on, it doesn\u2019t matter whatever culture OP had. If I offended my friend and their family at the friend\u2019s dad\u2019s FUNERAL, my first reaction is definitely not wondering whether I was the asshole or not", "True. If you make somebody upset at a funeral, much less for one of their parents, you are automatically the AH.\n\nI come from a place where wakes/funerals usually have heaps of food (and drink) too. I get it, but I was also raised to take social cues from what people around me are doing, and OP's own wording shows they did pick up on an expectation not to gorge themselves."]}
