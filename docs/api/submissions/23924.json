{"id": 23924, "submission_id": "15iu9hd", "title": "AITA for canceling a weekend plans after I was told to mentor a boy?", "selftext": "I had a very brief relationship with a woman named \"Karla\" that resulted in the birth of my now 8yo son Ashton. I'm gay and had never been with a woman. In fact I had never even kissed one until I met Karla. She had just gotten a divorce from her husband \"Chris\" because he wanted kids and she didn't.\n\nMy relationship with Karla didn't last and confirmed that I'm definitely gay. We were both shocked that she got pregnant though. Anyways, we agreed to coparent and signed a custody agreement that pretty much splits custody. Also, there is a first right of refusal in that agreement.\n\nKarla and Chris reconciled and remarried when Ashton was 4. Personally I like Chris. He is very good to my son. My son hugs and kisses him just as much as he does me. Chris doesn't turn down any chance to spend time with Ashton. I don't have to worry about Ashton if Chris is there because he'll get him where he needs to get, bath him, feed him and he has endless patience. I really like that my son has these hands on male caretakers.\n\nKarla was scheduled to have Ashton from Thursday to Sunday of this week. She mentioned that her cousin was in hospice and she was flying to another state to be with her. I said you can't take Ashton out of state without my written consent. She said she wasn't taking him. Chris was going to watch him.\n\nI told her that this was news to me. We agreed that if either of us is unavailable then the other parent needed to be notified and given the option to pick up more custody time. I'm obviously not going to turn down more time with my kid.\n\nShe said that Chris had planned a four day vacation to a water park. I said I don't care. She said \"you know what. Talk to him then. I got enough on my plate right now.\" So I did and  Chris said he didn't see the big deal and joked there wasn't enough Ashton to go around. \n\nHe then seriously suggested that I become a Big Brother so that he could spend more time with Ashton. I told him he got me fucked up and now I'm canceling this water park trip. He told me he was joking but he wasn't. He asked me to go parent another kid so he can parent mine. I was taken aback by it.\n\nSo Ashton is with me and I feel bad for Chris. I really do. But between that comment and not going through me when Karla was going out of town just angered me. I feel like I've been too nice.\n\nEdit: My son does not know about the water park. It was going to be a surprise. And to be honest, this boy has been to several amusement parks this summer so it wouldn't be new to him.\n\nEdit: If Karla and Chris had ran it by me then 85% chance I would had said yes.\n\nEdit: Chris did apply to Big Brothers twice. He was rejected once for not being Jewish (it was Jewish Big Brothers) and the other time was for several reasons. He wanted a little one when they only had teens, etc.\n\nEdit: Chris doesn't care that I'm gay.

I'm guessing it was a big reason he got back together with her. That was his mistake, but Ashton is your son, not his. Like you said, it's wonderful that Ashton has such a hands-on stepfather, and I feel bad that Chris will never have a child of his own as long as he's with Carla. He's the one who should mentor fatherless kids to fill his void.", "NTA You are Ashton\u2019s father and you have an agreement for right of refusal and Chris needs to understand that he is not Ashton\u2019s father. Obviously doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be part of his life and be a great stepfather, but you are his father and have split custody and have an agreement. As others have mentioned you should definitely have a talk with Karla after she gets back and has time to destress.

Could your delivery have been a bit better? Maybe, but not for your sake or Karla or Chris, but for Ashton\u2019s sake. It appears that all three of you will be a permanent part of Ashton\u2019s life so it\u2019s best if everyone can get along somewhat but your son also needs to know that his dad loves him and wants to spend time with him too.", "NTA, you had a custody agreement, both of them went behind your back. I only hope you planned something special to make up for the vacation your son missed out on through no fault of his own.", "ESH\n\n you definitely did this out of pettiness there, the thought of asking Ashton what he would like did not even cross your mind, be honest. \n\nLook if you agreed upon such an absolutistic rule then yes, your Ex was in the wrong, but y'all starting to sound like the stereotypical at-war-of-pettiness parents, which would ultimately hurt your son more than anything else. \n\nCo-parenting is about constant patience, trying to gauge what's best for the kid (not for either of the parents), and trying to be as peaceful and smooth transitioning as possible. In a lot of instances, it takes swallowing one's ego as well as pride.", "NTA\n\nI'm genuinely shocked that he had the balls to suggest that. I guess you are going to have to be 'the bad guy' and set up some serious boundaries, since Chris feels like he can get away with saying shit like that.\n\nHonestly though, your son is old enough to hear all of this. I'm curious what he has to say about his stepdad telling his Dad this crap.", "Chris need to know what that agreement says. Depending on the ex to tell him is not good enough. She might knave stuff out or outright lie. He should be included because he is in the kids life daily and needs to understand the agreement.", "That was my thought exactly, but then why did they wait four whole years before getting back together?", "Big Brothers, Big Sisters is a mentorship program where an older teen or young adult gets matched up with a child in need and basically hangs out with them regularly, mentoring, helping, and having fun with them. \nNo other child physically appears but when Chris suggested OP become a Big Brother, he was telling OP to go get another kid to watch because there wasn't enough of Ashton to go around, meaning Chris would rather OP go take care of someone else's kid than his own because Chris wants to push OP out of Ashton's life and become the \"real\" dad.", "Also get a paternity test if you haven\u2019t already\u2026", "It doesnt matter if he wants the kid \"so\" badly. It's not his kid and their custody agreement outlines what to do in this situation. Just bc OP is gay doesnt mean he doesnt want kids and doesnt mean he doesnt want HIS kid. \n\nIf Chris wants a kid so badly he could go get somebody pregnant, I'm sure there are many women out there who do want to have kids but are single.", "How does he suck by following the custody agreement?", "Your the asshole for thinking it matters how much he wanted the kid. It's not his child regardless of if he wanted it or not. Just because you want a child doesn't mean your entitled to someone else's child. Even if that child is your step kid, you don't get to make jokes about taking him from his real dad.", "I agree Chris seems very comfortable as the role of parent/dad, but I wonder if that's what karla wants/ is happy with as it means she can actively parent less.\n\nAs the situation with the cousin is considered an emergency, it makes sense that she didn't really think about it and decided to leave her kid with her husband, especially if they had preexisting plans (which i don't think we know). Chris definitely was out of line. And an expectation setting conversation is definitely in order.\n\nCan't remember what op said about custody, but if it's not 50/50, then it's time to go back to court and change it. \n\nI think some clarity about the first right of refusal would also be good. Like if Karla goes to the shop and wants to leave the son at home with stepdad does she need to call and ask if you want him for the 30 mins while she buys bread and milk, or go visit a friend for a few hours. (im not fully sure how it works) does she need your permission to send him to a sleepover at his grandparents or to his friends after school for a playdate? Or spending solo time with the stepdad, for any length of time?  Like, where is the line between a normal act of parenting (kid participating in life), and he's not with me right now, so I need coparents' permission to make a parenting decision. If that isn't already clear I think having a conversation and clarifying what is allowed and what triggers first right of refusal (being reasonable both to the coparent and to the kid who should get bounced around unnecessarily as parents exert control over each other).\n\nOp, Chris and Karla could all attend coparenting counselling together if needed to help communicate and work together well/better.", "It\u2019s not just you", "OP, do not follow this terrible advice. \n\nAside from the obvious violations of the agreement between you and your child's mother, no one *needs* to go to a water park.", "How can you just not comment on the big brother part?", "How can you just not comment on the big brother part?", "NTA.\n\nI'm desperately fighting for the first right of refusal.

Both of them, especially Chris, are overstepping and need to be put back in their place. Keep a watchful eye OP.", "NTA! Okay, this is where you need to start laying down boundaries. I'm worried this guy is going to alienate your son from you and Karla isn't going to stop it. Go see a lawyer and raise these concerns with them. Iron out more rules, Chris is no longer trustworthy and if you need to fight it in court then do it. Also, start talking to your son more and do therapy with him too, find out if Chris and Karla have been badmouthing you to him or if they want him to not call you dad anymore or not even consider you as dad. Gather evidence and take it all to court to make sure you have a solid place in your son's life and won't be replaced by them.", "I love your son has three loving parents. \n\nBeing kind has worked so far and in this situation (relative dying etc) you can understand (even if you cant forgive) if someone isnt 100% comprehending the situation & didn\u2019t run the agreed route. \n\nI would just make sure that you are firm and clear that you have the first right to your son as his dad, and while Chris is an important part of your sons life, he isnt his dad and he doesnt get to make those decisions. \n\nGiven that what youve said is that generally the relationships are good and healthy, i would try keep that going, if only for your sons benefit of growing up seeing that break ups happen but adults treat each other with respect and dont have to be combative.\n\nNTA, you were understandably just standing your ground", "NTA, originally I was leaning towards NAH because the stepdad seems great to the kid, but not with that Big Brother comment. That's your SON. Not his. You respect that he's a great stepdad to your child, but at the end of the day, that's still YOUR child. \n\nAnyone saying that Y T A really doesn't understand how underhanded that fucking comment was.", "NTA\n\nThere were custody agreements and they broke them. She might not have been thinking clearly because of what she is going through, but he should have been capable of following the rules.\n\nMake sure to get a lawyer and legal advice and make sure to make the weekend the most fun bonding experience with your son that you can make it!", "NTA\nYour coparent violated the terms of your custody agreement. SHE should have told her husband their plan was a violation, and wouldn't happen. Her making Chris \"your problem\" was also out of line.", "NTA.  Report this to the courts so that you have it on record that he is trying to come between you and your son.\n\nThis was after all an infraction of the custody agreement, as the boyfriend doesn't have any parental rights. And Karla leaving your son behind with Chris without your consent is a major issue.\n\nYou want to have this documented, because I wouldn't put it past either Karla or Chris to fabricate allegations against you to cut you out so Chris can get the child he always wanted.", "I'm not sure how to think about this. One one hand Chris's comment was absolutely unacceptable, and you needed to shut it down. One the other, you shut it down in a manner that punished your kid who no doubt was really looking forward to the water park trip with his stepdad. So all in all none of the adults had the child's best interest at heart here. So I feel like it's an ESH although I understand your actions, and may have done the same if someone had said that to me in the same situation. \n\nIt's fairly clear that Karla and Cris don't see him, as the stepdad, looking after the kid as the sort of babysitting that should be in the scope of the custody agreement's right of first refusal. Maybe you should revisit the agreement (in general if you don't already have 50/50 and) specifically about the right of first refusal as your kid is growing and will start more actively to look forward to activities like these, and if one of you just snags them away like this, it will not go well in the long run. All of this will cause tension that, ultimately, your kid will pay for. Karla and Cris may be inconvenienced, annoyed or angry but your kid will be hurt. Don't make him the victim of your battles. \n\nAlso, both of you may want to send them off to have a sleepover with friends or grandparents etc. Those relationships are important too and should be encouraged, not hindered. What would you have done if she'd arranged for a fun weekend with grandparents instead of Cris?", "NTA OP and I agree with your last sentence, yes you have been too nice.  I also agree with others that you get yourself a family custody lawyer and iron out your custody rules including that you have 50/50 custody, if you don't already have this.  While I think everyone here, including yourself, are happy that Chris is treating your son like family, but it seems that Chris is trying to usurp your role as Father/Dad and trying to relegate your role to that of a Uncle or Family Friend.  You need to protect yourself and your rights as a Dad because it seems that Karla is not respecting your role neither as she did not ask your approval for Chris to take your son on a 4 day vacation nor did she respect your rights of First Refusal.", "NTA NTA NTA!!!\n\nI'm speaking as a mother AND as a DV survivor.\n\nLook up parental alienation like YESTERDAY. If your child's mother doesn't take it seriously, gather as much evidence of what that man said as possible and get custody of your child. That wasn't a joke. That was a threat to remove you as a parental figure. Good luck.", "NTA. Aww. I hope Ashton did not know about the trip because if he did he must be disappointed. :(\n\nThis is down to Karla not communicating. Although the BF did make a smart ass comment. \n\nI think the three of you need to sit down and revisit the agreement that was signed. Maybe BF did not know about first refusal arrangement? Even if he did, stand your ground. You are listed as the Dad and have rights. Don't let them trample them.

Or should be.", "Chris only took her back cause she has a kid. I'm glad your custody order is strong, but document every time they try something like this. Starting now, when they're still joking around like it's normal and fine behavior.", "Major alarm bells here. They split because he wanted kids and she didn\u2019t, then she finds herself with another man\u2019s kid and they reconcile? In his eyes, that kid ain\u2019t yours. He\u2019s the replacement kid that Chris never got to have. I\u2019d be strongly rethinking my boundaries if I were in your position, because your ex and her husband have clearly got different goals in mind for your son than you do", "Here's a question, who are you taking that 4 days to benefit, you or your kid.  It sounds to me like taking that 4 days of waterpark away just ruins the kids weekend.  A conversation needs to be had for sure, but if you wanna assert custody make sure it's for the right reasons.  If your kid blames you for taking that waterpark trip, you are gonna have to eat that.", "Nta. They're trying to cut you out of the family.", "YTA..what is wrong with being nice.  Quit being so touchy and now you ruined a great time at a water park.  Did you take him to the water park since you ruined his trip with Chris?

If she keeps doing that, go back to court.", "ESH. You said you never wanted to be a father  but now you are fighting for fathers rights. You have to sit and think about how you really want to live your life. It seems like you do really want to be a dad, and you son seems pretty happy having a step-dad too. You must all decide what is best for the child.  Remember, once your son is of school age, unless you live in the same town, it's going to be harder for your son to spend a lot of time with you. Your ex needs to communicate a little better with you so you can discuss arrangements for when she is away.", "YTA. By all accounts it sounds like Karla is a good co-parent, isn\u2019t nasty or anything, doesn\u2019t try to create a divide and you chose to be petty, rude, and to create issues where there were none. \n\nKarla: FYI if you\u2019re trying to reach me, I\u2019ll be away because my cousin is in hospice and will be dead soon.   \nYou: YOU CAN\u2019T TAKE OUR CHILD OUT OF STATE. \n\nYou\u2019re such a fucking ass and I can\u2019t wait until Ashton gets older and realizes it for himself.", "YTA.

You can't say he's great and then refuse to let him do his job (provide backup and support for his wife, and take care of he's wife's son in an emergency).  Your reaction to a first offense (since you don't mention them crossing boundaries before) feels over-the-top to me and the first step towards a very rough co-parenting situation.\n\nYou do need to revisit custody and clarify it, because I know I wouldn't have thought my husband of years whom I trust and see care for my son so well couldn't watch my son alone, on my custody time, in an emergency.  Your son will notice the tension, will not understand your position, and then everyone is worse off.", "You feel bad for Chris????????\n\nNothing more to say Here.\n\nI don\u2019t understand people who come from your planet.\n\nFor you misplaced emotions, YTA", "Sorry but YTA.

It's about them not respecting OP enough to get his approval for Chris to take OP's son on a 4 day vacation to a water park.

If the other parent is busy, they can refuse. Then it's up to that patent to find care. Sleepovers or play dates with friends don't count. For example, the ex had a new baby last Dec.
