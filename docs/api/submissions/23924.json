I'm gay and had never been with a woman. In fact I had never even kissed one until I met Karla. She had just gotten a divorce from her husband \"Chris\" because he wanted kids and she didn't.\n\nMy relationship with Karla didn't last and confirmed that I'm definitely gay. We were both shocked that she got pregnant though. Anyways, we agreed to coparent and signed a custody agreement that pretty much splits custody. Also, there is a first right of refusal in that agreement.\n\nKarla and Chris reconciled and remarried when Ashton was 4. Personally I like Chris. He is very good to my son. My son hugs and kisses him just as much as he does me. Chris doesn't turn down any chance to spend time with Ashton. I don't have to worry about Ashton if Chris is there because he'll get him where he needs to get, bath him, feed him and he has endless patience. I really like that my son has these hands on male caretakers.\n\nKarla was scheduled to have Ashton from Thursday to Sunday of this week. She mentioned that her cousin was in hospice and she was flying to another state to be with her. I said you can't take Ashton out of state without my written consent. She said she wasn't taking him. Chris was going to watch him.\n\nI told her that this was news to me. We agreed that if either of us is unavailable then the other parent needed to be notified and given the option to pick up more custody time. I'm obviously not going to turn down more time with my kid.\n\nShe said that Chris had planned a four day vacation to a water park. I said I don't care. She said \"you know what. Talk to him then. I got enough on my plate right now.\" So I did and  Chris said he didn't see the big deal and joked there wasn't enough Ashton to go around. \n\nHe then seriously suggested that I become a Big Brother so that he could spend more time with Ashton. I told him he got me fucked up and now I'm canceling this water park trip. He told me he was joking but he wasn't. He asked me to go parent another kid so he can parent mine. I was taken aback by it.\n\nSo Ashton is with me and I feel bad for Chris. I really do. But between that comment and not going through me when Karla was going out of town just angered me. I feel like I've been too nice.", "created_utc": 1691237963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15iu9hd/aita_for_canceling_a_weekend_plans_after_i_was/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Custody agreements exist for a reason and first right exists for this exact reason. \n\nIt would help to put your foot down now and have a talk about it, with your Ex, NOT her husband. The agreement is between you two. This type of thing does get hard and it can be easy for it to turn into one parent \u201cplanning fun things\u201d and the other parent \u201cconstantly trying to make the kid sad by cancelling\u201d.

I imagine that young man, Ashton, would start to wonder about his \"real father\" meaning you.\n\nFight to stay in Ashton's life. Young children are often open towards anyone who appears kind and nice.  You need to consider long-term.  YOU should be the man who helps Ashton learn skills and pursue his interests. Maybe Chris can help, but you need to be very present for Ashton.\n\nAshton will sort all of this out in his mind as he grows older. Being cordial with Chris is a good thing, but it does not mean you give up all parenting to Chris.\n\nFollow your heart.", "I'm wondering if Chris is infertile and this was all a convoluted plan to have a baby.", "u skipped the part where another kid appears?", ">He then seriously suggested that I become a Big Brother so that he could spend more time with Ashton\n\nOh, fuck no.

These people are about to start phasing you out.", "NTA\n\nI'm assuming Chris saw a workaround to what he wanted with the woman he wanted and jumped on the opportunity when the chance was given. It sounds like he is trying to become your kids primary father and push you out. \n\nAfter karla is done with her stuff I would have a serious discussion with her (alone) about this and how you and her move forward in this arrangement. If she isnt perceptive I would go back to your lawyer. I would also wait a week or two since she might be grieving.", "YTA. This whole situation is screwed up. Karla divorced her husband who wanted kids because she didn't want kids. She then gets knocked up by someone who doesn't want to be in a kid producing relationship.

If you let this go - they would push for more.", "NTA. You have been too nice. Chris has gotten too comfortable with Ashton. It's great he's so willing to spend time with Ashton and loves him but he needs a reminder that you are Ashton's father. That remark about becoming a Big Brother was no joke, he wants to cut you out of Ashton's life and be the only father. When Karla comes back, you need to have a sit down and go over the custody agreement to remind her that you have the right of refusal. She may not be aware of Chris overstepping so much. Get it clarified now that you are and will be the Ashton's father forever.", "Is it just me or is the title completely unrelated to the post?", "NTA\n\nIf you don't have a lawyer, get one now. They are trying to alienate you from your son.", "NTA \n\nThe agreement has been done for that and should be respected. She should have told you about these plans before instead of just telling you she'll leave your son with his stepdad.\n\nBut, really, cancelling such a fun weekend for your son just to prove your point? Why didn't you just go with them?", "NTA\n\nThere's a literal contract and she didn't follow it", "Nta. I think you should take the \u201che asked me to go parent another kid so he can parent mine\u201d comment seriously. I have a feeling Chris wants to adopt Ashton as his own and I think that\u2019s why he suggested the big brother thing. You really should find a lawyer to protect yourself and your parental rights.", "NTA. Would have been NAH but Chris definitely meant that. He probably is very upset at the situation. Play the step daddy song for him.", "NTA at all.\n\nIn fact, given all of the context you've shared about how much you genuinely like Chris and how great the coparenting relationship has generally been, his thoughtless approach to this whole situation and downright hateful comments to you about \"becom\\[ing\\] a Big Brother\" (and what a disgusting implication that was, that just spending time with any child at all was somehow commensurate with parenting your own child, as if you were a random adult \"spending time with\" Ashton and not HIS DAD) . . . this whole thing was not only obnoxious of him, but ridiculously unnecessary.\n\nBecause, given that your relationship with all parties has been friendly and mutually supportive up until now, it seems as though perhaps if Chris or your ex-wife had approached you in advance and said, \"Hey, she's got to be away for four days and Chris would love to take Ashton on a little mini-vacation, would that be okay with you?\" that you might have agreed to it. But that's the point: they owed you the respect and acknowledgement, as his dad, and according to the custody agreement, of ASKING, not TELLING. \n\nThey don't get to make plans during time that is legally yours, and then inform you of them as though it's a fait accompli. And when you point out how inappropriate their actions are, they definitely don't get to be so hateful as to suggest that you go find a random child to hang out with (what?!) in place of your own son.\n\nOf course you're NTA. They owe you an apology, both for the way they went about this, and for the unbelievably rude comment.", "YTA. You are putting your desires before those of your child. Your child would have been happier going to the waterpark. You are creating unnecessary division in what seemed like a good parental arrangement. Put the needs of your child before your own.", "YTA,\nYou are actively trying to refuse Ashton a chance to hang out with his step father. It's as simple as that. Do you honestly not think that Ashton would've benefited from some one on one time with his step father?", "NTA\n\nChris was bang out of order and does look like he is trying to replace you and your ex is not making an effort to deal with the situation.\n\nChris is trying to bully you because you are gay and doesn't think gay people can be parents.\n\nYou don't sound like you like confrontation but you need to take a hardline for now on to set boundaries. If Chris continues this behaviour you will have get lawyers involved to get your time with Ashton set in stone.\n\nYou are Ashton's father you have rights.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm guessing it was a big reason he got back together with her. That was his mistake, but Ashton is your son, not his. Like you said, it's wonderful that Ashton has such a hands-on stepfather, and I feel bad that Chris will never have a child of his own as long as he's with Carla. He's the one who should mentor fatherless kids to fill his void.", "NTA You are Ashton\u2019s father and you have an agreement for right of refusal and Chris needs to understand that he is not Ashton\u2019s father. Obviously doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be part of his life and be a great stepfather, but you are his father and have split custody and have an agreement. As others have mentioned you should definitely have a talk with Karla after she gets back and has time to destress. Give her a week or so but both of them may need a reminder that you are Ashton\u2019s father and deserves to spend time with him, especially more than Chris.", "Well I wouldn\u2019t say that yta, I mean you\u2019re technically in the right because the child is yours, you and his mother have an agreement, and you\u2019re not wrong to insist on sticking to that agreement. Could your delivery have been a bit better? Maybe, but not for your sake or Karla or Chris, but for Ashton\u2019s sake. It appears that all three of you will be a permanent part of Ashton\u2019s life so it\u2019s best if everyone can get along somewhat but your son also needs to know that his dad loves him and wants to spend time with him too.", "NTA, you had a custody agreement, both of them went behind your back. I only hope you planned something special to make up for the vacation your son missed out on through no fault of his own.", "ESH\n\n you definitely did this out of pettiness there, the thought of asking Ashton what he would like did not even cross your mind, be honest. \n\nLook if you agreed upon such an absolutistic rule then yes, your Ex was in the wrong, but y'all starting to sound like the stereotypical at-war-of-pettiness parents, which would ultimately hurt your son more than anything else. \n\nCo-parenting is about constant patience, trying to gauge what's best for the kid (not for either of the parents), and trying to be as peaceful and smooth transitioning as possible. In a lot of instances, it takes swallowing one's ego as well as pride.", "NTA\n\nI'm genuinely shocked that he had the balls to suggest that. I guess you are going to have to be 'the bad guy' and set up some serious boundaries, since Chris feels like he can get away with saying shit like that.\n\nHonestly though, your son is old enough to hear all of this. I'm curious what he has to say about his stepdad telling his Dad this crap.", "Chris need to know what that agreement says. Depending on the ex to tell him is good enough. She might knave stuff out or outright lie. He should be included because he is in the kids life daily and needs to understand the agreement.", "That was my thought exactly, but then why did they wait four whole years before getting back together?", "Big Brothers, Big Sisters is a mentorship program where an older teen or young adult gets matched up with a child in need and basically hangs out with them regularly, mentoring, helping, and having fun with them. \nNo other child physically appears but when Chris suggested OP become a Big Brother, he was telling OP to go get another kid to watch because there wasn't enough of Ashton to go around, meaning Chris would rather OP go take care of someone else's kid than his own because Chris wants to push OP out of Ashton's life and become the \"real\" dad.", "Also get a paternity test if you haven\u2019t already\u2026", "It doesnt matter if he wants the kid \"so\" badly. It's not his kid and their custody agreement outlines what to do in this situation. Just bc OP is gay doesnt mean he doesnt want kids and doesnt mean he doesnt want HIS kid. \n\nIf Chris wants a kid so badly he could go get somebody pregnant, I'm sure there are many women out there who do want to have kids but are single.", "How does he suck by following the custody agreement?", "Your the asshole for thinking it matters how much he wanted the kid. It's not his child regardless of if he wanted it or not. Just because you want a child doesn't mean your entitled to someone else's child. Even if that child is your step kid, you don't get to make jokes about taking him from his real dad.", "I agree Chris seems very comfortable as the role of parent/dad, but I wonder if that's what karla wants/ is happy with as it means she can actively parent less.\n\nAs the situation with the cousin is considered an emergency, it makes sense that she didn't really think about it and decided to leave her kid with her husband, especially if they had preexisting plans (which i don't think we know). Chris definitely was out of line. And an expectation setting conversation is definitely in order.\n\nCan't remember what op said about custody, but if it's not 50/50, then it's time to go back to court and change it. \n\nI think some clarity about the first right of refusal would also be good. Like if Karla goes to the shop and wants to leave the son at home with stepdad does she need to call and ask if you want him for the 30 mins while she buys bread and milk, or go visit a friend for a few hours. (im not fully sure how it works) does she need your permission to send him to a sleepover at his grandparents or to his friends after school for a playdate? Or spending solo time with the stepdad, for any length of time?  Like, where is the line between a normal act of parenting (kid participating in life), and he's not with me right now, so I need coparents' permission to make a parenting decision. If that isn't already clear I think having a conversation and clarifying what is allowed and what triggers first right of refusal (being reasonable both to the coparent and to the kid who should get bounced around unnecessarily as parents exert control over each other).\n\nOp, Chris and Karla could all attend coparenting counselling together if needed to help communicate and work together well/better.", "It\u2019s not just you", "OP, do not follow this terrible advice. \n\nAside from the obvious violations of the agreement between you and your child's mother, no one *needs* to go to a water park.", "How can you just not comment on the big brother part?", "How can you just not comment on the big brother part?"]}
