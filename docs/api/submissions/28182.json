I generally go back to the US at Christmas. \n\nMy mom (72F) is a textbook covert narcissist. Though  we get along better now, going home for like 12 days generally ends up with me swearing up and down to myself I'll never go back. \n\nThere's always at least one incident where she does or says something truly horrific. \n\nShe's never been welcoming about me bringing people to the house. But at this point, I've been with my fianc\u00e9 (47 M) for 4 years. He's the sweetest, kindest soul I've ever known. \n\nThey haven't met yet. \n\nMy mother has issues with the house and upkeep  (understandable) but plays the martyr/victim card heavily, instead of actual problem solving. For several years she's been calling me in crisis mode and trauma dumping about it. It then all turns out to not be that big a deal. \n\n I'm actually terrified her endgoal may be for me to eventually give up my life here to move back and be her caretaker. \n\nLast week she called and asked us--me and my fianc\u00e9 to go and stay for 2 months to do repairs in the spring (he is a builder). It'd an amazing job op for him money-wise, plus language experience and living in my childhood town for a bit. \n\nI thought it would be a good idea for us to check out what needs to be done and take advantage to do some family bonding over the holidays. \n\nSo, yesterday I asked her if I can bring him home for Christmas-- since we'd be there in the Spring, a first contact would be nice, right? \n\n And WWIII was kicked off, she shot that down faster than a bat outta hell.  She got evil that I'd dared to even ask. \n\nAmongst the typical Narcissist guilt thrown at me. She got a bit rude about my fianc\u00e9 (insinuating he was somehow behind \"not letting me\" go home alone) and then... basically uninvited me. And then said we wouldn't be needed in the Spring, we'd been replaced. Ridiculous. And hurtful.\n\nMy mother is a fanatic about Xmas, and generally gets very hostile at the thought of me not visiting then, so this was an empty threat, I'm sure. But a Narcissist is always playing mind games and I'm at the effing end of my rope with her shit. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9, whose parents passed when he was young  (and has never dealt with N parents), thinks I should suck it up and go--just to keep an eye on her, assess the real situation, and try to sort some things out for her. That she's my mum, and if I don't go I may regret it. So now I'm confused and feeling guilty. \n\n I don't want to leave him home alone at Christmas (again), he is my family--and hers by proxy, as well. Who the hell doesn't want to meet their daughter's fianc\u00e9??? He deserves to feel welcome in my home in the US, and it pains me deeply my mother can't find it in her heart to have us both--when she mainly ignores me when I'm at home anyway. \n\n I'm tired of her games FFS.
