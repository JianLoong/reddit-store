You are 100% allowed to your feelings towards religion. She is allowed to feel sad because she wanted to share something important to her personally. \n\nJust have an open conversation about the role of religion in both of your lives. If it is a deal-breaker for either of you, this may establish an end. Conversely, you may be able to come to an understanding. Religion may vary drastically in personal message, indoctrination, and future commitments. Discuss these with your partner", "Oouuff, this hit me in the feels because I married someone like you, but my conclusion is NTA. \n\nIt took me time to realize that just because I had good memories at church didn't mean my partner had the same. Similar to you, my husband has STRONG feelings against supporting an inherently hateful system. It wasn't easy, but after some time I was able to agree: the system sucks, but my community is great.\n\nMy main connection with religion had more to due with feeling like I was part of a community & that's where the values stemmed from. Your gf just sounds like she needs to make that distinction between her values that come from her actions & religion which is a very large system that has no clear definition or boundaries. \n\nI grew up Catholic so I guess the Vatican was a great enemy. haha", "I\u2019ve been in gf\u2019s shoes, asking a partner to go to Church with me, I didn\u2019t attend often but it was foundational for me as a child. I\u2019m no longer Christian for similar reasons as your own. \n\nI was hurt at the time too. More so by the fact I was also quickly shot down; I would have taken it better had she been more gentle about it. \n\nAll this to say: NAH, you are under no obligation to go to something that\u2019s uncomfortable for you, but maybe a softer delivery on your part would hurt less.", "NTA, and i say this as person who's entire familly is christian. You really don't have to go to church.", "NTA - you aren't religious, don't obligate yourself to attend religious events when it is not your faith", "NAH, she's allowed to ask, you're allowed to decline.\n\nShe's also allowed to be a little disappointed.", "NAH for this. If she keeps pushing it, she becomes an AH.\n\nYou do not want to attend church, and this is a reasonable boundary. I knew someone who wouldn't step foot in a Catholic church for anything except a funeral--paying respects was important enough, but a wedding wasn't. You are allowed to avoid religious institutions (specifically or generally). Mass is particularly problematic for a lot of people for a wide range of reasons.\n\nYou are not preventing your girlfriend from going (if you did, then you would become an AH).\n\nAdults can have reasonable discussions about this. She can feel her feelings, and as someone who calls her your girlfriend, she should be able to express those feelings to you and be respected. You can also share your feelings with her and expect respect.", "NTA\n\nIf attending mass causes you discomfort, don't attend. It's a reasonable thing to do and I'm sure (rather, hope) if you happened to have another religion, your girlfriend wouldn't ask you to go \"for her\".\n\nThat aside, I'm not remotely religious and Idgaf about any of the rites. However, for a variety of reasons I've ended up in mass many times (example: the family who sheltered me over Christmas wanted to go to mass), and every time I just stand and sit, and stand and sit. Making it very clear that I'm not part of the rite. Then when they pass the hat around I say no. And I leave when everyone is happily engaging in symbolic anthropophagy. If being there bothers you, you shouldn't go. But if you think you can put up with it, your girlfriend will probably be thankful (I hope).", "NTA\nIt's not for everyone.

I understand that you might not be thinking long term, but religion is one of those hot button issues that can, and does, ruin relationships.  And, again I realize this may be in the far future, what if you had kids?  I'd bet she'd want to raise them in the church.  Just food for thought.", "NTA.

My two cents though, while you there's no need to apologize for not wanting to go to Easter mass.  It wouldn't hurt to be apologetic about being dismissive.  While your words were aimed at the church and religion she probably took some of that personally as she is a part of it.\n\nMay make the inevitable discussion go a easier.", "NTA for not wanting to go to church, but you WBTA for not realizing that non-church figures have been responsible for hate and suffering on a massive scale. Just think Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Pol Pot as a start, they are responsible for the death of millions of people, millions. How can you possibly justify that? You can\u2019t, and you should not be expected to, just like your GF shouldn\u2019t be expects to justify the people killed in the name of religion. \n\nI am not religious myself, but thinking hate and suffering occur because of only religion, that is not correct in any way, shape or form. So do you excuse the hate and suffering perpetrated by non-religious people? If you do, then WTF.\n\nTrying to equate hate and suffering to religious, and non-religious groups is your own version of tilting at windmills.", "NTA, also you need to drop her or she'll brainwash your future kids.", "And depending how serious the relationship is, handling religion with possible children needs to be discussed first.", "It's a big deal...
