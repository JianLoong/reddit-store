Helping every now and then, and being paid for it, is fine, but you shouldn\u2019t be full time parenting this baby. It doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll do much but I would normally tell you to get your parents involved to help set boundaries with your sister.

She\u2019s a bad mother. I don\u2019t care if I get downvoted for saying this but she has repeatedly prioritised meeting her friends over spending time with her child, to the point where he calls someone else mama and cries when going to her.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that your mother failed you, in this situation and otherwise (refusing to get you a prosthetic arm + dumping all chores on you).
