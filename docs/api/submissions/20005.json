I wasn\u2019t expecting to get a +1 but since it was offered, I got excited and said yes, I would love to bring my gf. My family is a lot of fun and weddings are always a good time\u2014lots of drinking and dancing and laughing\u2014and I would love for my gf to experience my extended family for the first time in such a great environment. My cousin said it was great, that she was very excited to have her join us, and I thought that was that.

However, it would probably still be the first time most of my family besides my parents and sister (and now the bride, I suppose) would learn I was queer, and it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll pay some amount of attention to us since they would not be expecting it. I know wedding guest etiquette says you should never do anything that takes attention away from the bride and groom, and I\u2019m not sure if this counts as a violation of that. \n\nTo be clear, the bride herself seems absolutely fine with it. My gf also already spent money on transportation to attend, so it\u2019s defintely happening. But I just can\u2019t shake a weird nagging feeling that I\u2019d be doing something shitty, or if it would come across like I was hijacking their special day by nonchalantly using it as a little coming out party, or if I\u2019m just overthinking it\u2026 trying to get some perspective.

But I don\u2019t think LGBTQ+ folks should have to make \u201ccoming out\u201d a big deal, no one \u201ccomes out\u201d when they\u2019re straight. If people want to make it a big deal that you\u2019re bringing your girlfriend, that\u2019s on them, not you.", "NAH but come out now so any possible attention grabbing will be over by the wedding.  You may get more attention or more trouble than you can foresee or your cousin wants.  If coming out to friends and family is not a big deal, then it will be even less of a deal previous to the wedding.", "You're overthinking. This is who you are and there is nothing wrong with who you are. It sounds like your family is going to be welcoming and happy to meet her. Go, have fun, and try not to worry, though I know it's hard. NAH", "It's not being the asshole to do something at a wedding that the people getting married have specifically said you are allowed to do.\n\nIf you want to lessen the impact, can you try to mention it to a cousin or two, and get other family members who know to work it into conversation with those who don't?\n\nLike \"Hey sis I don't want to be the centre of attention at the wedding or distract anyone too much so if you speak to Tina can you mention that I'm bringing my girlfriend?\"\n\n\"Hey Tina are you looking forward to Sarah's wedding?

Yeah Rachel is coming and she's bringing her girlfriend, I don't think you've met yet\"", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, but before the wedding might be the time for that Facebook post you mentioned\u2026", "This is a non-issue.", "NTA.\n\nIf anyone has a problem with it, it's their issue not yours.\n\nYour cousin is fine with it.", "NTA. The cousin is good with it and honestly if your family is progressive then this shouldn't be any different than if you were straight and brought a bf.\n\nI mean unless you were gonna like walk into the venue with you gf and shout \"That's right my partner is a LADY and I am a LESBIAN!!!\" That might turn a few heads", "If no one else will have a problem with it, why are you worrying?\n\nActually, a wedding is kind of a traditional \"meet the fam\" event in my world - and no one is supposed to police anyone's plus 1 (in some cases it can be a \"I brought Maggie so I'd be sure to have someone to talk to\" situation)", "NTA your family knows and the bride knows. That\u2019s what matters. You can\u2019t be expected to call every extended family member you haven\u2019t seen in awhile  on the guest list to tell them you\u2019re gay. That\u2019s such an unfair burden to place on someone who already has stuff to worry about. Let\u2019s not make it harder to be gay. Go to the wedding. Enjoy yourself.", "Can you plan for a meeting with parents or some family before the wedding?  Even iii its day or two before the wedding?\n\nYou will be taking some attention away from your cousin and everyone will want to know about you and GF.  \n\nCousin may be fine now, but no one knows how all the relatives will behave at the wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou're good as long as you act like normal, adult wedding guests.  \n\nThere is no rule of which I am aware that requires any guest bring a +1 to announce their bed buddy preferences ahead of time.", "NTA. You have a +1, you have a partner.. you can bring them. \nI\u2019m queer too and it saddens me so much that this still is an issue. Nobody would even ask anything like this if this was about a cis straight couple.", "Info:  Why not tell them before the wedding, I'm sure you have time so why just talk to those who don't know if you know you won't be judged", "NTA. You have a plus one, bring your boo. That's how these things work.", "You sound very considerate for worrying, and this is a valid concern, but you did the beyond all clear check - the bride cleared it. You\u2019re fine.\n\nI also think you sound like a great guest for being this worried. If you need to soothe your concerns, maybe consider some family phone calls to privately come out first and let people know you don\u2019t want to detract from the wedding, so you\u2019re giving them a call because you love them\nAnd wanted to personally let them know before the wedding.", "Stop overthinking and just do it. Plus, the extended family probably already knows", "It usually is a no-go to have a coming out kind of thing at someone's wedding, but as the bride is fine with it I'm going with NTA. If you want to be mindful about it, I would recommend checking in with the groom as well. Also, when is the wedding? Can you use the family gossips to get the news about your girlfriend out beforehand?", "You know the bride better than anyone else but honestly what would you expect her reaction to your question to be? Oh no, please don't bring your girlfriend in case it upstages my day? The bride had no other option than to say she was cool with it did she.\n\nWeddings are about family, but proposals and baby announcements are not cool, you let the people paying for the day have their moment. Maybe bring forward your moment/ celebration to the family pre wedding to avoid any drama.", "YTA. I think this is all about feeling better about yourself. Since you\u2019ve already committed to the trip, then why even post this? What good is it going to do?\nI don\u2019t think your family is as \u201cprogressive\u201c as you\u2019re making them out to be, else this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal at all. \n\nAlso, not sure if the bride is OK with this or not. You\u2019re putting her in a difficult position, where she might feel like an asshole for saying no. \n\nI think you should actually come out now, that way it won\u2019t be a big deal at the wedding.", "If you feel uneasy about your decision, then you probably shouldn\u2019t do it\n\nJust casually mention it to your family \nEven if the bride and groom are OK with it, the tension in the air still might be there \nA wedding is not the place to take a huge group of people by surprise \nAnd sure you might think it\u2019s not a big deal, but if there\u2019s alcohol involved, it may become that LOL", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
