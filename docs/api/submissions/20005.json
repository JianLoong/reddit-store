Enjoy!", "NTA if you talk to the bride first and I would try to come out beforehand so its not like you are taking attention away from the bride. You are putting thought into this which is very important.", "Are you kidding?  You could get arrested!  (Checks calendar.). Oops, my bad , it\u2019s 2023, not 1943.  NTA", "NTA. And I\u2019m so sorry that you even half to debate all of this with yourself. Bring your love to the wedding. You will be surrounded by family and friends on a day that celebrates love. Anyone surprised will no doubt adjust quickly, some have probably already guessed. You won\u2019t be taking away from the bride and groom. If there is by chance a big reaction from anyone than that is on them not you. You don\u2019t owe an explanation to anyone for simply living as you are.", "NTA \n\nYes, you shouldn\u2019t do anything that takes away attention from the married couple, but you aren\u2019t asking for anyone\u2019s attention. If they give it to you anyway, that isn\u2019t your fault.", "NTA, you've been together for 3 years, anyone who hasn't met her yet is not that close for you to worry about.\n\nThe bride knows, so you're fine.", "Just soft launch your gf on social media and through the family grapevine in advance of the wedding. Then it's truly the non issue it should be.\n\nEdit to add verdict: NAH.", "Your cousin is fine with it and that\u2019s all that matters", "NTA, but be sure to come out before the wedding. You don't want to cushion any potential coming out drama by using another person's big event as a shield. \n\nJust because it's ok, doesn't mean feign ignorance of people's possible reactions. Let the dust settle a bit.", "NTA. If it was my family, just show up with your gf and introduce her around. NBD.", "As long as your family is progressive and not a bunch of conservatives you are good. One of my children, with a very similar story was invited to bring their partner to my nephews wedding. Only my aunt was a bit surprised, but partner had a great time and got to meet lots of family. Was fun for all.NTA", "NTA. Don\u2019t think it would be a distraction if your family is as progressive as you say. Just be low key and have a great time", "NTA. You were offered a plus one, you're bringing someone. It could have been your spouse, your partner, your best friend, your kid, etc.\n\nI think that you may be worrying over the being gay part since this is an \"official\" family function? It can be a big deal to bring a partner and introduce them as your partner no matter what your sexuality. Unless you both decide to make an actual spectacle and shout \"this is my GIRLFRIEND!!\" every time you talk to anyone, it's not going to be a big deal. ;)\n\nJust do the same as if they were ANY partner that hasn't met specific friends/family: *Hey, aunt X, lovely to see you! This is my girlfriend, Blanche, she's a professional horse whisperer.*", "NAH. Everyone actually sounds really lovely. A rare occurrence on this sub lol.\n\nYou seem very considerate and thoughtful in your wishes to not upstage the happy couple. However, if you already told the bride that you're bringing your girlfriend, surely she was able to put 2 and 2 together? Regardless, big weddings often entail introducing new partners to extended family for the first time - it's kind of expected when the invites include a +1 - and this should be treated no differently. \n\nIf making a big \"hey everyone I'm gay!\" social media announcement is just not your style, then I don't think you should have to do so. I'm glad to hear that you're expecting to receive a warm welcome - as you should! But if you're feeling like you need to preemptively clear the air with your cousin just for your own peace of mind, then by all means give her a call and let her know your concerns if it would mean that you and your girlfriend will be more able to have a stress-free time.\n\nHave fun at the wedding!", "If there are people in your family that are aware of your sexual orientation, then it would be safe to assume that a good chunk of your family that you\u2019ve never told are aware of it too. If you are worried, share your concern with your cousin. Let them know that you haven\u2019t officially \u201ccame out\u201d to all the extended family and what your concerns are. If they\u2019re cool with it, take your gf, introduce her to the family and have a good time.", "Not remotely tah. Bride is fine with it. That\u2019s all that matters.", "i don\u2019t even have to read this to say NTA. you are who you are. bring your girlfriend and have a good time. if people want to sit in their feelings and be shitheads about it that\u2019s on them not on you. weddings are fun and to celebrate the people getting married. if they\u2019re gonna be too distracted by two people in love then they probably shouldn\u2019t have gone to the wedding in the first place. have a good day and happy pride month", "NTA, \n\n**IF** \n\nYou double check with your cousin AND her partner, and give them **all** the information.  Don't assume anything about what they do or do not know. Just give them all info like you put here. She may not have realised that not everyone knows. \n\nAnd yes, basically coming out on someones weddingday is an absolute no-go. As is introducing a new partner. Or anything that draws attention away from the wedding couple. \n*Unless*  they FULLY agree, ofcourse.\n\n\nI hope everything works out well!", "Speak to the bride about your concerns because it's a woman you are bringing. Let her know that you don't want any attention to be missed placed. \nI would possibly call your parents and drop in conversation that you were given a plus one. They hawho you are bringing, and you can be honest. Tbh, as a parent, I would prefer to hear my child has a partner no matter the sex, from themselves rather than social media. I would definitely let them know personally.", "NTA.  People have to be utterly stupid to make a big deal about a gay couple in 2023.", "NAH.  perhaps  ask bride or your parents for advice, perhaps they can let it trickle through the grapevine so there are no surprises.  \n\nAlso rehearse a few introductions and lines to duvet the conversation of it gets too much attention,  like \"I'm glad you have so many questions about GF and our relationship but I want to focus on the bride.  Well see you at Thanksgiving/ Christmas!\"", "I think it would be best to introduce her before the wedding as soon as possible.  \n\nYour gut is trying to tell you something.  Listen to it. \n\nThe bride says she doesn't mind, but that could easily change when you show up with a gf and devert all the attention.  If that happens, it could go nuclear really fast and ruin not only the wedding for the bride, but what should also be a happy introduction of your gf to your family. \n\nThat's just not something you spring on a family at a big event. Especially a wedding.  Brides are notoriously moody at those things. \n\nGive your family a few days to digust this  new person in your life. Being gay may not be the thing that might or might not upset them, but the fact that you didn't share this person with them for 3 years. Honestly, that part is what would make me angry. \n\nEither way, good luck and i hope everything works out!", "Ywbta. As much as it is okay to be gay, it is NOT okay to make someone else's wedding be about yourself.", "I think you had better 'come out' before the wedding - you don't want to upstage your cousin's wedding by 'coming out' there, on that day.\n\nYes it's a violation of wedding etiquette to do anything on the day that takes attention away from the bride and/or groom.\n\nEDIT: You Could be YTA if you wait until the wedding. You Could be NTA if you deal with it now.", "Discuss it again with the bride and groom, or at least make sure the groom is aware. The rest of the family can suck it up as long as those who matter are ok with it.", "Definitely agree that you\u2019ll need to officially \u201ccome out\u201d before the wedding to alleviate the humming and hawing, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll be a big deal at all. If anyone does happen to say or do anything, just kindly ask them to focus on the bride and groom for the day. NTA", "Don\u2019t come out at your cousins wedding.\nIt\u2019s their day and not yours.\nIf things go south you\u2019ll ruin the mood and possibly the wedding.\nThere\u2019s a time and place for everything and at the wedding isn\u2019t one.\nAs people suggested you might want to come out before or after the wedding. \nJust do it in person with your family instead of letting them find out over a post.", "I\u2019m trying to think of a less awkward way to phrase it, but if she doesn\u2019t want to make a post that\u2019s just her coming out, she could post something like \u201cMy girlfriend and I are so excited for Cousin\u2019s wedding next week!\u201d", "Or talk with the bride now, communicate your concern about not appearing like an AH, and see what she suggests? Sounds like a family where some well planted gossip might make OP's status old news long before the wedding.", "If straight people don\u2019t have to announce their sexuality and make it a big deal, I don\u2019t feel like LGBTQ+ folks should have to either. We shouldn\u2019t owe the world a PSA just because we\u2019re gay. \n\nJust like everyone else who is bringing a plus one to the wedding, it shouldn\u2019t matter who it is or what gender they are. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re planning on wearing white dresses or something truly socially improper, they\u2019re just a regular couple existing.", "Yeah - you don\u2019t want to draw attention away from the bride and groom, even if everyone is cool with it.", "Exactly. It\u2019s infuriating when you think about it like this.", "As a straight older lady I agree with you.", "Yeah the bride probably told her parents and siblings\u2026 so that\u2019s a chunk of people to spread the word.", "Planning a meeting creates more drama than it solves. Better to keep it all low key; just make sure most people are in the know before the wedding.", "How is bringing her partner to a wedding making it about herself?", "That could happen with literally any relationship. Someone might talk about a new partners race, or height, or the mole on their cheek. There's no way to bring a new partner meeting extended family for the first time to a gathering and not potentially draw any attention. Unless you're saying it's wrong to bring any partner to a family event without them having met the family first it's far from fair to hold gay people to a different standard and where is a partner supposed to meet family other than a family event?", "She could post literally any couples shit they've done", "You do realize the world we still live in right? I understand clearly what you mean, but unfortunately being \u201cgay\u201d still comes as a surprise to some people. She simply just doesn\u2019t want to take the spotlight from the bride and groom. So although she is still planning on going, she still has a lingering feeling that regardless some spotlight might be brought on to her. \n\nI don\u2019t think she should have to Facebook post \u201chey by the way I\u2019m a lesbian\u201d but either way I\u2019m sure somebody at the wedding might cause a ruckus about it.", "I mean, even for straight people, introducing their partner for the first time at another's wedding could be  seen as tacky, depending on the family's dynamic. The wedding is supposed to be about the main couple, not X's new gf/bf. And like it or not, a LGBTQ+ \"come out\" would likely generate way more talk and attention. It shouldn't, but it would, and OP want to avoid it.  \n\nIf they will come out and announce their relationship at the wedding anyway, why not do it now to avoid \"stealing the spotlight\" on the big day? That's just the best solution.", "\u2026that would also be easier and much more natural. I may be a little stupid.", "Anybody who thinks that someone bringing a new partner to a wedding is 'tacky' in and of itself needs to get their ego checked.  If the people are being respectful and not taking an undue amount of space, who the hell cares? 'taking attention away'? Super weird IMO.", "Irrelevant when it occurred to her.  She has already made her decision to go, so why worry about what the effects are?  It\u2019s disingenuous to ask this question when she refuses to make any adjustments based on the judgement. \n\nAnd the bride\u2019s excitement could be her just being nice. What else is she supposed to say? \u201cDon\u2019t bring your gay girlfriend to my wedding\u201d? Then, she becomes the AH. So, I\u2019m disregarding the bride\u2019s response.", " I personally don't care. Hell, I wouldn't even care if another's wearing white at my wedding. But that's just me.  \n\nIn this case, the bride gave her okay already so really OP is in the clear. But they're still asking this because they don't want to accidentally take too much attention from the wedding itself, out of respect. They don't *have* to do anything, but they *want* to do something, out of respect for the wedding couple.", "Disregarding the brides response when it\u2019s generally the main qualifier for this stuff seems interesting.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure if the bride said \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d at this point, she wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe fact is, she\u2019s mulling over her effect on people and worrying about it, so she\u2019s considerate - even if not as considerate as you\u2019d prefer it seems.\n\nThe gold standard for doing things at a wedding is in fact the bride. The bride in this case was openly excited about it. Sure, OP could be lying, but I don\u2019t see any reason not to take her at face value.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s lying. It\u2019s also quite possible that the bride is totally good with this. \n\nI just take the situation with a grain of salt, for the reasons I gave. You completely disregard that. There is important context. LGBTQ issues are very polarizing. Many people feel compelled to support things they don\u2019t agree with. That\u2019s why there are a lot of closeted Trumpers. \n\nSo it\u2019s not at all implausible that the bride is not completely good with this, but did not feel comfortable expressing it.\n\nAgain, my point is that the OP is asking questions that she doesn\u2019t really care about the answers to. She never gave any indication that she would cancel the trip if the bride told her to. And that\u2019s not thr question:  \n\nShe\u2019s asking if she\u2019s TA for possibly distracting from the wedding by \u201ccoming out\u201d with her gf. She\u2019s not going to change her plans, so why ask?\n\nAnd self reflection isn\u2019t really self reflection if you don\u2019t do anything about your conclusions."]}
