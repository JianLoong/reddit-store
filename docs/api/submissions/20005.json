Families DO talk, like I knew a cousin I\u2019ve never met except on FB was gay because her grandmother chatted about it when I was in town visiting family and everyone was like \u201cOh, that\u2019s nice\u201d and that was it. Hopefully this is not a big deal to OP\u2019s extended family and they have a lovely time at the wedding.", "I agree. Redirect any conversation to the couple.\n\nLike, oh yes, but enough about our relationship, how about the bride and groom?! How long have you known (bride / groom, them as a couple)?", "Smooooth. You like buttah!", "That\u2019s a sound plan, as well. It could also serve to suss out any potential problems.", "I think it depends on extended family attitude about being. The idea is not turn the wedding into a circus. It only takes 1 jerk to ruin the whole wedding", "Right? Is every non stereotypical couple supposed to post before the wedding just so everyone else knows what's going on? Just meet the family as is, you probably aren't going to meet every single person at the wedding anyway.", "In a perfect world, you\u2019re right; they shouldn\u2019t. However, that world is not yet here, and we shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves into thinking that it wouldn\u2019t make some waves. \n\nListen, a wedding is a highly emotionally charged situation at the best of times. People are already walking on eggshells with all of the unwritten rules and customs around weddings. One homophobic family member or friend is all it would take to completely tank the mood of the wedding and potentially ruin it for everyone. Would that person be an AH? Absolutely! But, EVERYONE (especially the Bride and Groom) would be left with the aftermath.", "You\u2019re absolutely right that it shouldn\u2019t matter, but unfortunately it still does. Being straight is still seen as the \u201cdefault\u201d sexuality and OP acknowledges that most of her family will have assumed that she\u2019s straight, so her showing up with a GF will likely become a topic of conversation. And depending on family reaction, it might even cause a scene. \n\nOP is just trying to be a good guest.", "Yes!!!!!! This!!!!", "But the bride is cool with it and we all know that brides run the show!", "She is coming out as gay at a wedding that is full of homophobes. Anyone could tell you that this will result in 100% of the attention falling on her. \n\nRegarless of how much she personally hates these people for their beliefs, it isn't right to ruin their big day for some drama.", "Depends on how often she posts to Facebook. If she never posts stuff and she does this right before a wedding that she's bringing her girlfriend to, I think pretty much everyone will get why she's posting it.", "And that person who causes a ruckus would be  TA, not the queer couple.", "I have to say I grew up in the rural southern Us and most people don\u2019t give a shit and if they do they generally keep their mouth shut. OP is just worried, but they have nothing to worry about. Anyone who would cause a ruckus is absolutely the asshole. Do you think interracial couples should let everyone at a wedding know that they are in an interracial relationship prior to a wedding so they don\u2019t detract from the couple?", "Yeah but a bigot could also cause a ruckus because someone brought a not white partner, do people in interracial relationships need to come out in advance of big events to give racists time to come to terms with seeing a black person? Where's the boundary where it becomes the marginalized person's responsibility to prep the attendees of an event they're going to for the fact that they exist rather than the bigot's responsibility to exercise a single iota of manners and impulse control?", "Yes, THAT person would be an asshole for causing a scene. Gay people don\u2019t owe anything to homophobes, especially not \u201csoftening the blow\u201d of coming out online, if they don\u2019t want to. \n\nThis might be a minor example of it, but cowering to bigots, so they don\u2019t get their precious feelings hurt is never a good idea. It only emboldens them to demand more ground you should acquiesce to them.", "That world is here. The only people keeping it from not being here are people telling queer people we are still different enough that we have to hide ourselves to keep the peace. Like you are saying. What is the difference between someone who is homophobic and someone who says they aren\u2019t homophobic but still tells queer people they shouldn\u2019t be authentic so they don\u2019t potentially upset someone homophobic? I see no difference.", "It sounds like their family weddings are loud, lots of activity and JOYOUS (the kind I like!), so since the bride already knows and approves, OP and GF are just part of  a great  big party.  OP is NTA.", "I can't imagine caring about someone doing this. Unless their partner is an asshole there's nothing wrong with this at all. If this were a problem they wouldn't have a plus one.", "It\u2019s seen as the default because y\u2019all keep insisting everyone acts like it is.", "If the bride knows and approves, all is good.", "Why would their shitty reaction be her fault? She\u2019s bringing her partner just like all the other straight couples would be. If someone reacts badly to that, it\u2019s on them. Why blame her?", ">I may be a little stupid.\n\nIt's okay, we still love you.", ">I may be a little stupid.\n\nThen you're in good company.", "But it would still be a ruckus that could have been avoided at someone else\u2019s wedding", "So see, herein lies the rub. The question wasn\u2019t whether or not the fact that OP SHOULD have to come out before, during, or after. The question is do we think that doing it would ruin the wedding. I vote NTA all day, but we have to face facts, someone else\u2019s wedding isn\u2019t the best place to take this kind of a stand. At least, not someone that the person taking the stand cares about.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "I couldn't agree more!", "This isn\u2019t a question of ideals. It\u2019s a question of timing. The world we both hope for simply isn\u2019t going to arrive before this wedding. No amount of proselytizing will make that happen. \n\nI\u2019m on board with you 100%. Please understand that. I am in no way condoning the status quo. However, fighting the good fight in the long term isn\u2019t going to help OP\u2019s imminent problem, which we\u2019ve been asked to judge.", "1. Don\u2019t know who \u201cy\u2019all\u201d is supposed to be. \n\n2. People do? Just act like it is? At least in my experience. Agree to disagree IG", "Your*", "Still not the fault of the queer couple.", "Maybe a ruckus is necessary.", "You are defending homophobia STOP, RIGHT NOW!", "Hey the bride is OK with this. The problem is the, potential, homophobic AH. Why would you try to justify that behavior. JUST STOP", "But she\u2019s not planning to make a stand. She\u2019s planning to go to a wedding with her girlfriend. Two very different things. \n\nIf we worried about people being potentially upset at gay couples existing during any social occasion, then we\u2019s have to advocate for every gay and bi person to go back into the closet. And\u2026fuck that.", "Read the post carefully.  The bride already knows and approves!\n\nThis is 2023, not 1969.  Everybody going to that wedding knows that LGBT+ people exist.  In most economically advanced countries same sex marriage is legal.\n\nThis OP would not be \"taking a stand.\"  She would simply be attending a wedding.  With her GF.", "You feel that a world accepting of gay couples does not exist yet.  I'm trying to understand that, because that has not been my experience as a married lesbian.\n\nAre same sex marriages legal, or not, in your country?", "I\u2019m not talking about ideals. \n\nYou\u2019re not on board with me, you don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying. This isn\u2019t about \u201cfighting the good fight\u201d and OP doesn\u2019t have a problem, OP is anxious. There\u2019s no problem here. \n\nI\u2019m gay and from the rural Southern US. No one has ever made a scene. That doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ve got family that belongs in homophobic cults, I\u2019ve met plenty of homophobes and talked to them about being gay, but people don\u2019t \u201cmake scenes\u201d because they see a gay couple. People might make a comment to the person next to them, but it\u2019s not like OP is sitting down with their pastor grandfather to talk about being gay. Her immediate family knows. Her 3rd cousin who she hasn\u2019t spoken to in three years isn\u2019t going to make a scene because she showed up with her girlfriend, that\u2019s not how homophobia works. \n\nYou don\u2019t understand homophobia, and your advice actively fuels OP\u2019s anxiety while blanketly saying that she should avoid bringing her girlfriend because she has the potential to ruin the wedding for everyone. You are an asshole and your \u201cadvice\u201d is harmful and why queer people stay in the closet much longer than they should.", "Ugh, just another entry in the miles long \"weird wedding nonsense I first even learned of in an AITA comment thread.\" Especially the endless fussing and calculating how \"attention\" is being distributed.", "Y\u2019all would be straight people. I\u2019m gay and from the rural Southern US and I have literally never had anyone I don\u2019t know well \u201cmake a scene\u201d about a queer couple. I have family in a homophobic cult and they have never said anything to my face. Telling queer people that they should hide themselves in order to avoid a potential scene because straightness is viewed as a default is pretty fucked up.", "Huh?", "No. \u201cYou are in good company.\u201d", "A ruckus is often called for!\n\nMaybe not at a wedding, but I love a good ruckus.", "It can happen before the wedding so the bride and groom can have their big day free of drama", "That\u2019s pulling back a pretty long bow. I\u2019m not at all saying that the belief is right. I\u2019m simply having to accept the fact that it still currently exists in the world, and it behooves everyone to remember that. Progress is being made every day. Just because a swamp has been drained doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t still watch out for snakes.", "Sorry, LC.  I wrote my comment above with out being yours.", "Congratulations, you\u2019re gay. But, you\u2019re still wrong. OP didn\u2019t ask us to comfort her. She asked us to judge whether or not bringing her GF to the wedding would be an AH move. I don\u2019t think it would. However, in my initial response I mention that the idea SHE WROTE in her OP might be a good one.\n\nWhere you live and the small slice of all 380 million people in this country you\u2019ve met are irrelevant. It\u2019s anecdotal. My family is also from the South. When my little brother came out, he caught hell from many people for it. My experience is defending him both verbally and otherwise for the latter half of our teen years. I\u2019ve seen quite a bit of what homophobia can do. It\u2019s not pretty. I don\u2019t happen to be attracted to men. It\u2019s not how I was born. My brother does. It\u2019s how he was born, and it\u2019s as simple as that. The issue is real, and I feel for any LGBTQIA+ person out there who has to live in the shadows in REAL, SUBSTANTIATED fear because of how they were born.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve actually bled defending gay rights. And you call me the Asshole? This is why it\u2019s unwise to throw accusations and misplaced inferences around when you don\u2019t know what the f* you\u2019re talking about.", "I'm joking about being dumb by correcting with the wrong \"your\".", "That was the joke.", "OP literally said her family is progressive and non judgemental. This post is her anxiety speaking.", "Yore*", "That\u2019s part of why I voted NTA. That judgement was the substance of my message.
