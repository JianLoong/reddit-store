If she was so worried about it she would have retrieved it immediately. I would not replace it or offer her compensation especially at the moment when you are thousands of dollars out of pocket.

(Like, bad communication has NEVER happened before in a relationship... /s )\n\nIf there's more to the story, then I'm sure we'd all love the context.

Ironically it\u2019s more likely to be covered on the owner\u2019s home insurance that way - my laptop for instance is a listed item, and is covered not only in my own home but elsewhere too.

I'm pretty sure that collection had more sentimental than monetary value.", "op definitely made this story up to keep the apple watch his one night stand left at his olace", ">but it should invalidate your statement of losing thousands.\n\nYes....but also no.\n\nMany insurance companies go to painstaking lengths to either avoid a payout or delay the payout as long as they can. In the event of the latter, then that money may have been earmarked for some short-term expense that we don't know about. I'm not saying this is the case, but it'd make sense why OP would phrase it like that.", "Didn't think it was relevant but since so many people are asking here you go.
