I told him no since we're already having problems setting up my home office in his apartment since I'll be moving there next year. This made me angry since my friend knows very well I can't stand his dad and that the two other friends get on my nerves very, very quickly. To top it all off, M23 asked me if I could take M25 with me since his dad's car is already full.\n\nI promptly told him no, there's no way these people are gonna stay at my husband's place, I told him no, which my husband seconded. My friend kept trying to convince us to say yes by telling us how much fun it'd bea and how much cheaper it'd be for them to stay at his place, and that it would be very egocentric to not let them stay and take M25 with me since he'd have no way to come with them if I wouldn't give him the ride.\n\nHis dad called me and told me I'm a disgrace and that I should rather be married to one of his daughters. He even told me he'd bring one of his daughters with him to set me up with her.
