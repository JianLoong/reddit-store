Having been a supervisor, if you have something you want to communicate to staff or coworkers, the last choice for effective spread of the message would be a social media platform. If I changed my profile pic, I wouldn't \"expect\" anyone to notice, much less comment. This is very odd. Now, adding that you're \"civilian\" implies he's not. Is this behavior a change for him?
