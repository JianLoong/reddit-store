Very much \"you're an evil sinner and disgusting and need to repent\" type of Christianity. I left once I turned 17 and joined the military, my brother is a \"true believer\" and all that.\n\nAbout a month ago my brother's wife and two kids died in a car accident after they got into an argument and I offered to let him stay with me since he didn't want to go home and have to see their stuff. I don't really get along with my brother but he's still my brother.\n\nA week or so into it and I'm back to my typical routine. My brother mostly stays in his room being depressed and I don't know what to do other than get back to my normal. He won't see a therapist or a psychologist because \"the Lord provides\" or something. I start going on dates and I end up hitting it off with this one guy, we decide to take it to his place but his roommates start getting into a massive fight and he asks if we can go to my place while they yell at each other.\n\nHe stays the night pretty much watching GBBO on the couch together all night. Brother decides to lecture me on \"appropriate interactions\" with men I'm not married to. I tell him to back off and that I'm only letting him stay with me because of what happened. He does back off and that's it.\n\nContinue to see the guy and eventually send up bumping uglies. Brother decides to lecture me about successful intimacy to which I remind him, again, that his wife is the only reason I'm not kicking him to the streets.\n\nEventually my sister texts me our safe word for when things are home are \"less than safe\" and I go pick her up. She is literally in tears, bag packed, and I can hear our parents yelling at each other from outside.\n\nI start heading to my place and my sister tells me not to go home either. I stop the car and tell her she's gotta tell me what's up if she wants me to not go home. She tells me she's gay and that she got caught posting on social media about a girl she's secretly dating and she doesn't want to go to my place because she knows our brother is staying with me and he's likely going to hear about it from our parents. So I tell her I'll sneak her without him knowing and she can stay in my room and then we can figure it out in the morning.\n\nI just don't want to leave her with someone I don't know or somewhere I'm not familiar with.\n\nMorning comes and we all sit down at the kitchen table and brother starts getting into his \"you must resist the temptation of sin\" lecture and I send my sister to my room and tell him to get out immediately. He starts arguing with me with this whole \"we have to save her from these feelings bs\" to which I tell him he has 30 seconds to start packing and shutting up or I'll call the cops.\n\nHe now thinks I'm an asshole, my sister is saying I'm an asshole for being so mean to him, and idk I kinda feel like the asshole.

This is the issue with fundamentalist Christians, they'd much rather their own family suffer incredible amounts of pain in the name of \"salvation.\"\n\nYour brother was advocating for essentially trying to forcibly convert your sister. This is rhetoric that leads to literal torture of queer people. He's not safe and the fact he's  grieving shouldn't matter. It really sucks what happened to him and I'm sure he's hurting but he doesn't get to hurt others and use his grief as an excuse.\n\nThe reason you feel like an asshole is because *you're a good person* and can empathise with him hurting.

Brother needs to  get the log out of his own eye - he\u2019s got no place lecturing you.  You protected your sister, who now says you were mean -for protecting her.  You have repeatedly followed the Great Commandent while those you have helped are first to cast a stone at you.", "NTA, your brother overstayed his hand when he lectured you about your own relationships let alone lecture your sister about living her own life.", "NTA. If your brother wants to have his beliefs he can. But he can\u2019t thrust them onto you and your sister. Those are his beliefs not yours. You and your sister should be able to live your lives without his judgements. I commend you for taking up for your sister. She needs to know that there is nothing wrong with how she feels or how she lives her life. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong either. Your brother has a lot of growing up to do.", "NTA.  He has his own place he can go to.  He can set his rules there.  In the meantime, your place, your rules, your boundaries and he stepped over them.  As for your sister, not sure why she is mad at you.  She didn\u2019t want to deal with him and you stood up for her.  She has absolutely no reason to say you are an a hole.", "NTA.

Why can't he stay with your parents or friends? He even has a home to go to...\n\nMaybe you could have given him a final warning, but I think you made the right call by protecting your sister first. Your sister won't be able to block off his attacks like you do and you have the right to protect her. You can go and visit your brother if you still want to show you will be there for him, just not allow him to talk shit to your sister.\n\nIf you feel like your brother really needs you again (maybe after a cool off period) you could offer him to stay at yours under the condition that he doesn't talk to your sister like that and will be out the second you hear of it. Yes his times aren't easy, but he has to learn not everyone follows his rules and he has to adjust to the house rules if he stays with you.", "NTA, God will provide him a place to live.

Be careful, because I'm making this as clear as I can, you can have your sisters, or you can have nothing.*   \n\n\n*This is my one and only warning, and my only demands.

Why didn't he? Clearly God didn't provide for them, two of whom *were fucking children*", "NTA. First off, you are a wonderful sister and imo anyone would be lucky to have you as their sister. I\u2019m glad your little sister has you in her life to be a steady, supportive role model. It\u2019s too bad your brother doesn\u2019t appreciate you opening up your home to him. What happened to him is tragic but at the end of the day he\u2019s still a guest in your house and has to respect your rules and expectations. I think you were absolutely right to ask him to leave. You and your sister deserve a safe place and it sounds like your home is that place so long as your brother isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s truly sad that he won\u2019t go see a therapist. I believe in God but I also believe that God gave us doctors and therapists and uses them to help heal us.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour feelings are understandable. Even asshole family members should be treated as family. Your instincts to protect your family are good - brother now sister. Your brother overstepped the second time he gave his opinion, and now is interfering with you ensuring your sister has a support system.\n\nProtect your sister. This is not too far off from what could happen to my daughter. She confided in me some time ago (I'm not the main custodial parent) and I made it clear that I want her to be her and she has a safe place, always.", "Not only are you NTA but you\u2019re an absolute hero. Wonder Woman has got NOTHING on you and I commend you. The world would be a beautiful place if more people were like you.", "NTA, but please get your sister into therapy if you can manage it. She's been raised to believe that \"people like her\" are everything that's wrong with this world. She probably thinks that the problems between you and your brother are her fault. She needs to hear that there is nothing wrong with who she is, and she needs to come to an understanding with her own self and beliefs. As her sister, you can help support her, love her for who she is, and help her find her path. A therapist will be helpful in a different way, because a therapist doesn't have a familial obligation to her. They're a minimally biased third party, and sometimes an outside voice helps more than anything else.", "NTA. Try and get an appointment with a cps agents immediately about becoming main guardian of your sister and inform them of the situation in case your parents try to ship her off to \u201ccamp\u201d. Also begin documenting everything with your brother and parents. Record all calls and keep all texts and emails. Also try to get your sister in therapy and her own bank account as well as her important documents like birth certificate and spa card.", "NTA\u2026 your brother is a bigot and if ur sister thinks that maybe she shld have called her \u201cgf\u201d for help then instead of you. U defended her and this is how she acts? U let ur brother stay with u and that\u2019s how he acts? I get it, it\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d but are they serious? And all of this in your home? Wow.", "NTA by any stretch. What your brother is going through is tragic but that gives him no right to enforce his religious beliefs on the person who opened her house for him and to try to CONVERT his younger sister for being gay. You put very clear boundaries and he wouldn't respect them. He's out.\n\nHowever I've been noticing a lot of negative comments regarding your sister for calling you an AH and I feel I need to say something.\n\nI didn't have it nearly as bad, but I was still a teenager from a strict Catholic family who found out they liked girls in the mid-2000s, with a less than perfect relationship with both siblings and parents, so I feel I can speak from the same general direction. Your sister likely doesn't mean it, but she's still in survival mode and I've generally found it's actually really common in kids who were abuse survivors that some may side with the abuser against the others (either in specific situations or in general) as a way to protect themselves from any further abuse. Your sister is in a safe place now with you but she just escaped a traumatic situation that is now following her into her new supposedly safe place (supposedly from her perspective, obv she's in good hands but she may not realize it just yet). Likely she's just lashing out. I would just have a talk with her and do everything you can to keep her safe. Some others suggested trying to find a way to be declared her guardian and find her therapy, if you have the means to I would say look into it but I can also understand why you'd maybe have trepidations about it, so spend some time to think on it.\n\nBest of wishes, and as a queer person, thank you. :)", "Your sister also thinks you\u2019re an asshole for sticking up for her?!  Wow. Just wow. \nYou are NTA. Your brother can pound sand - sorry for his loss. But his attitude, judgement and lectures aren\u2019t welcome. And your sister is welcome to go with him or back to your parents if she is so upset with your efforts to protect her. \nSo sorry your family is such a mess. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got your shit together!\n\nEdit to add - any guy who will watch GBBO with you is a keeper!  \ud83d\ude0d", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The combination of brainwashing from the \u201creligion\u201d and the grief, which is absolutely real, is deadly. Your brother won\u2019t do anything right now, but your sister needs you, and you did the right thing. But, but if you want some basic advice, I have some. I am also queer (bisexual) and I have very religious family. My uncle, which is supportive, did little things such as putting up a Canadian pride flag (were Canadian, a Canadian pride flag is the Canadian flag but the maple leaf is rainbow) in his front yard, and posted things online by gay celebrities, and watched queer focused shows with me. It seems small, but was showed me that he supports me. Maybe talk to your sister about meeting her girlfriend? Invite her over for dinner or something, to help show her that you\u2019re a member of her family that she doesn\u2019t need to hide that from. She\u2019s young enough to escape a lot of brainwashing, and she\u2019s SO INSANELY LUCKY to have you. I want you to internalize those words. You are doing amazing. You did the right thing, and your sister loves you, and I can feel your love for her. I apologize if my advice is unwanted, just tell me and I\u2019ll delete the comment. You\u2019re an amazing sister, op. Also, your sex life is your business (but since your sister is young, don\u2019t shake the walls too hard\ud83d\ude02) and I hope your brother didn\u2019t get to you too much for that. Sleeping around consensually and with clear boundaries on all sides is a great thing if that\u2019s what you want. And this is a bigger thing, and idk where you live, but pride month is next month (June). Maybe do something small with your sister to show her she has a whole, beautiful community who will love and support her? Like gifting her smth like a rainbow/lesbian flag (if she identifies as lesbian) phone case, or taking her to a pride parade? This is traumatic for her, and I hope that she\u2019s able to learn she\u2019s allowed to be who she is and she\u2019s doing amazing. I\u2019m proud of you, you did the best thing. Much love from Canada", "It\u2019s funny because the thing Jesus talked about the most wasn\u2019t resisting sin.
