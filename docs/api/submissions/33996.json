{"id": 33996, "submission_id": "18tysap", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for not letting my father give my son an iPad?", "selftext": "Thank you all for reassuring me. Since my post last week, a few things happened (including Christmas, of course).\n\nSome people in the comments suggested accepting the iPad, but hiding it away until Arthur was old enough to use it. I really didn't want to do that at first, but after talking to my husband, we decided we could try to make it work.\n\nI told my father we'd come to my aunt's place for Christmas and accept the iPad on the condition that he didn't let Arthur see it. Our plan was to tell him that grandpa had gotten him a gift for when he got bigger. He had said he wanted a Hot Wheels track for Christmas a while ago, and my husband and I had bought it for him, so we offered to have my dad gift it to him instead.\n\nI expected my father to agree. Instead, he accused me and my husband of not trusting him and Shelly, as well as denying Arthur something he'd spent so much money on. He also denied our race track idea, saying that he had the right to decide what he'd get for his own grandson.\n\nI hung up on him and called my aunt to tell her we weren't coming for Christmas. She asked me about it, and I ended up explaining the situation to her.\n\nWell, it turns out that mine and my kids' presences were more important to her and my cousins than my father's. My aunt threatened to ban him and Shelly from her place if they gave Arthur the iPad.\n\nAfter a small fight and a crying fit from Shelly (I'm not exaggerating), all over the phone, my father apologized and asked what else he could get my son for Christmas. I gave him ideas of toys, books and art kits Arthur would like.\n\nHe ignored them and got a pair of socks. Whatever, Arthur still liked it.\n\nMy father and Shelly gave the iPad to her sister's kids (they now have two). I know that because Shelly made a point of telling Arthur, in front of me, that her nephews got the \"best gift ever\", and that she was sorry he couldn't have the same thing.\n\nArthur just kept playing with his new Lego set. He either didn't listen or didn't care. I still made sure to keep her away from him throughout the night.\n\nMy dad saw that, and I think he finally realized my kid wouldn't care about the iPad. He called me yesterday and apologized, more sincerely this time.\n\nAll that said, I think you guys are right about him. This whole incident has made it clear that he doesn't really respect me as a parent or care about my boundaries for my children. I will closely monitor the time he spends with Arthur and Lucy in the future.\n\nThank you all and happy holidays!", "created_utc": 1703887477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tysap/update_aita_for_not_letting_my_father_give_my_son/", "score": 137, "replies": ["I would keep Shelly away from your kids.

I will say just because you give a tablet doesn't mean they'll be like those iPad kids, my 4 year old and 2 year old have one but they only play learning games and maybe once a week so it's all about balance.", "Shelly needs to learn her damn place.", "Shelly sucks for that comment. Your dad too, but that nasty comment trying to upset your son was way out of line. \n\nMay Shelly always find the loose Lego when walking in bare feet. \n\nYour aunt however, may her bare feet always find the Lego free soft carpet.", "Shelly is an AH", "I\u2019m so glad it worked out!", "I never read the original but I'm with others that this went way better than I would have expected.  Your aunt is gold.  Your dad kinda sucks but might be trainable.  Shelly is a hag, and needs to be kept away from your kids.  It's a very good thing that you had some boundaries now because your dad is probably starting to realize that he may end up needing to \"choose\" between bringing Shelly around everywhere and seeing his grandkids if he can't get her to stop being heinous.  A very good outcome.", "Yay! Former teacher here. Good for you for sticking to raising your child as not addicted to tech. Your Dad and Shelly suck.", "Thank you for the update!   Gald it turned out mostly well in the end.", "YTA!", "I am so glad your Dad actually sincerely apologised. I was in a similar situation with an age inappropriate electronic gift for my kid and he accused me of neglecting my kids when I said no and hasn't talked to me since. \n\nShelly sucks though.", "Hopefully your dad will respect your decisions as a parent more in the future. Good job on staying strong and taking steps to raise your kids without an overreliance on technology!", "And so freaking juvenile. So gross. Ew. Keep your precious boy away from HER.", "It appears that Wee Arthur already knows to ignore her.", "I honestly had no idea the term \"iPad kids\" existed until I wrote this and people pointed it out to me. It's good to know I'm not the only one who thinks that's a problem.", "I'm kind of surprised at how things turned out. I expected a whole lot worse.", "Why", "My youngest was around 4 when all of my kids got their own tablets, but we had strict screen time that really worked so they weren't on their tablets all day and was still social and played outdoors.\n\nI think many times ipad kids get that way because the parents never limits the ipad time, and never restrict the use of the ipads.\n\nMy oldest kids knew that in order to use their tablets they had to finish their homework in addition to limited time on the tablets each day. They had more time during the weekends, but still not unlimited use, when their time was up the tablet locked until it was a new day.\n\nAnd the tablets was also timed, it locked at a set time at night and didn't unlock until a set time in the morning.", "I\u2019m a dance teacher (still in high school though) and the parents that expect the iPad to teach kids actually shocks me. The kids with the most technology have the worst manners. We gave them bracelets for Christmas and not one kid out of around 25 said thank you. \ud83d\ude10 it\u2019s tough out here getting respect from 10 year olds", "My mom bought my daughter an iPad when she was a toddler. I was pissed. But fortunately, she was a dumb toddler. We used to let her play with it for a bit and then be like \u201coh no! The battery is almost dead! We need to charge it!\u201d Even though the battery was at 98%. We also didn\u2019t tell her the passcode.", "I live in Latin America, and my son's school doesn't use gadgets until middle school. So to say that I was surprised when I got comments on my original post about how my kids probably have to use it in class is an understatement.\n\nIn my opinion, you can't replace teachers. Least of all with an iPad.", "Oh wow lucky, I live in Ohio and the kindergarteners have Chromebook\u2019s (like laptops). This didn\u2019t happen until after covid, before covid only 7th grade and up got Chromebook\u2019s and I happened to be in 7th when covid hit.", "Jfc they're giving Chromebooks to kindergarteners?", "It's how we dealt with in person school being stopped during the pandemic. Schools gave cheap super basic Chromebooks and tablets to kids so they could do school over zoom or other meetings apps.", "Yeah. It is how my son was able to finish kindergarten in 2020. He\u2019s in 4th grade now. He says that they only use their Chromebooks now for practice stuff for math and computer class. My daughter is in 7th and uses it in most of her classes.", "Unfortunately \ud83d\ude10. My school has like 0 dollars in the bank account as well and almost closed this year so I\u2019m not sure how they are affording them."]}
