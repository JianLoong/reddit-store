{"id": 20332, "submission_id": "14g79eq", "title": "AITA for allowing my brother not to go to our mother's birthday?", "selftext": "I (24M) have a little brother (16M) who we'll call Leon. When Leon was born we soon found out that he's deaf and hearing aids wouldn't help. \n\nMy parents were very upset and didn't put much effort into accommodating for his disability. To this day they only know very little ASL. \n\nI (8yo back then) started taking classes on ASL and spend all of my money on it to be able to communicate with my brother. \n\nWhen I was 20 I went to court in order to get custody of Leon, because his life alone with my parents would be difficult. \n\nI won. \n\nOur parents were very mad, but they got over it and we all have a good relationship now. \n\nEvery year Leon and I visit our parents on the holidays and birthdays. Some other relatives are usually also there and I'm the only one who speaks ASL. Because of that I'm usually stuck translating for Leon and he's usually excluded from the conversation. \n\nWe told them many times to try and speak with him, but they only ever talk a few sentences. \n\nLeon isn't happy about it, but he understands that it's too much trouble for them to speak to him through me. (I disagree and think that they could put in more effort.) \n\nA few months ago Leon met his boyfriend Jace (17M), who is a coda. Leon is happier than he's ever been before and Jace and his family are all really nice. \n\nNow on to the problem. \n\nJace's birthday is on the same day as my mother's. \n\nOf course Leon is invited to both of them and he decided that he'd rather go to Jace's. I can completely understand him, so I allowed him to go. \n\nWhen I told my mom that Leon wouldn't be coming, she absolutely lost it. \n\nShe screamed at me about how I was stealing her son and that this day is very important to her. (It's her 55th birthday, while it's Jace's 18th). \n\nI tried to tell her that Leon wasn't happy about being excluded (for the 800th time), but she didn't listen. \n\nDuring the last few days I received texts from almost all of our relatives telling me that I was an asshole for keeping them from seeing Leon and that they were looking forward to it. My dad told me that I ruined my mom's birthday and that I shouldn't come if Leon wouldn't either. \n\nI didn't know that it was so important to them to spend time with him, especially because they barely talk to him. I still think that it's right to let Leon stay with Jace, but I also don't want to hurt our family. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1687449405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g79eq/aita_for_allowing_my_brother_not_to_go_to_our/", "score": 131, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I allowed my deaf little brother to go to his boyfriend's birthday instead of our mom's, where nobody would be able to communicate with him anyway. \n2.) A lot of family members including my mom told me that they were looking forward to my brother and that they were hurt he wouldn't come.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good decision on his part, from the sound of it.", "**NTA**\n\nYour family honestly sounds toxic AF, and if you and your brother are happy, healthy, and kind I just don't see any reason to play into their BS.

You are Leon\u2019s parent now and you know best.", "NTA.  They deserve a response that the time has come for him not to have spend time with people who could not bother to learnt to communicate with him, especially his own parents.  In this day and age of voice recognition on a cell phone, the more distant relatives would not even have to learn ASL to have a conversation.  It's really time to stop accommodating your family.  Leon showing up on their birthday helps justify in their head that their behavior has not been terrible to Leon.", "NTA this has nothing to do with either you or your brother and Leon shouldn't be forced to attend just because it looks better for your mom.", "*<I received texts from almost all of our relatives telling me that I was an asshole for keeping them from seeing Leon and that they were looking forward to it.>*\n\n**- keeping them from seeing Leon** seems the right words, as that's what they do.

A good thing you're the one with custody, and also the ONLY ONE who took the effort to learn ASL.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd if it's so important for them to spend time with Leon, why don't they come over to spend that time with him?", "NTA. You have custody, it was your decision. If they wanted a better relationship with him, they should have learned how to communicate with him.", "You are a great brother and advocate for Leon.  Communicating with him in ASL (his native language) is so important, and so is encouraging others to do so.  Someone's use of ASL doesn't have to be perfect, but I think the effort to communicate this way means a lot to a Deaf person.  Continue supporting Leon and being there for him and Jace.  You are very fortunate to have each other. \n\nAlso, your parents can't just swoop in and out when it's convenient or important for them.  For you to get custody, at 20 years old, there must be more here.  \n\nStay the course. NTA", "\u201cMom\u2019s a verb. She chose to not mother and nurture her own child because.  \n\nIt isn\u2019t reasonable to expect to be treated  as \u2018mom\u2019 when she chose to not mother.  \n\nLeon has to live his life as it was presented and that will mean he may reasonably choose to interact with those he can communicate with.  As you know, being deaf doesn\u2019t negate the need for love, acceptance, shared values, an ability to share thoughts, dreams, ideas. \n\nIt is exceedingly normal for a person to choose to spend their time with those who enrich our lives.  To me, it\u2019s beyond selfish that she demands to be celebrated when she abdicated her obligations to become fluent in a language she could share with Leon.", "He is 16 years old and they never learned ASL? That is terrible. He should never have to see them. Ever. Every time is a reminder of how little they care for him- that has to be traumatizing.", "NTA.

But in that case, what are the odds that OP escapes the squalor and magically has the means to provide for his brother?
