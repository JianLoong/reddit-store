While orientation week was chill, things have escalated so quickly. I feel like I\u2019m always attending a lecture or lab, and it's quite frankly exhausting. That being said, having so much freedom feels pretty nice and the stuff I'm learning is interesting.\r\n\nI will admit that this new schedule has prevented me from calling my parents as much as they would like, but I honestly thought they\u2019d be more understanding. Apparently, I was wrong.\r\n\nMy mom (F56) called me this morning asking how my classes have been going and mentioning that I must be pretty busy since I forgot to call her yesterday (which was her birthday). I confirmed this and apologized to her. I had forgotten it was her birthday until later in the evening, and I sent her a quick text wishing her a happy birthday.\r\n\nShe accepted my apology and told me that it was okay, considering that moving away and starting college is already super stressful. I started telling her about my courses and their challenges, and how it is stressful. She listened, but I got a bit annoyed when she kept on saying things like \"I know\" and \"It was also difficult for me.\"\r\n\nShe began telling me about how she was so homesick when she started college back in the '80s and how she had weird roommates and such. I felt that she wasn\u2019t listening to me anymore, so I told her that our situations were pretty different and that she probably didn\u2019t understand as much as she thought.\r\n\nShe asked me how, so I told her that when she went to a college an hour away from her parents\u2019 house, while I moved to an out-of-state one. I also told her that her degree (sociology) wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as mine (chemistry), and that back in the '80s school was generally much easier.\r\n\nShe got defensive and said that it was reasonable for me to assume that and that I was being condescending. We argued a bit, and she told me that I was being na\u00efve. I was really frustrated at this stage, so I told her not to waste my time with useless conversations as I already had enough schoolwork.\r\n\nShe became really upset and left the call, which I also thought was immature. I was talking with my friend Jess (F18) about it later, and she said that I was being a little mean.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1694192036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dfrny/aita_for_telling_my_mom_not_to_compare_our/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom was trying to empathize with you, including asking you about your experience and what you\u2019re struggling with.

You are not the only person to have ever struggled with the transition to college, and there is no Most Suffering trophy.", "YTA. While you are at college, why don\u2019t you take a women\u2019s history class and try to learn something. \n\nYour MOM went to school in the 80s. Unlike you, she couldn\u2019t google any answer she wanted. Unlike you, her professor could sexually harass her in the middle of class, and not one classmate could whip out a camera and record it. Unlike you, if she was lonely, she couldn\u2019t just find someone to chat with on her phone with thousands of internet strangers to chat with at any time on any topic. Unlike you, she actually needed to know how to properly spell words when writing a paper. \n\nGo cry in your cheerios over how being \u201csolely responsible for so many things\u201d, and realize that your mom was most likely cooking, cleaning, laundry, and knowing how to sew on a button for YEARS prior to you feeling overwhelmed that you have to go to lecture and have the connivence of Grubhub at your fingertips.", "YTA. So you forgot your mom\u2019s birthday and then when she called to check in on you and see how you\u2019re managing, attempting to make *you* feel better by telling you that she knows from personal experience that you\u2019re in a stressful transition period, you just told her that she couldn\u2019t possibly understand because no one has ever been through anything as difficult as you have? \n\nLook, 18 and beginning college is a stressful transition period. But as grown up as you feel, you\u2019re not actually grown up yet. It\u2019s very immature of you to minimize your mom\u2019s experiences and tell her that she had it easy. How do you know how difficult college was in the 80s? Do you know how much work she had to put in just to find the right articles and books to read from the library? Have you ever had to type out a whole essay on a typewriter that doesn\u2019t really have a delete key? Your experiences are **different** but one wasn\u2019t more difficult than the other. \n\nYour mom was trying to graciously forgive you for hurting her feelings and she was trying to relate to you and understand your experience. Then you called talking to her \u201cuseless.\u201d You owe her an apology.", "YTA.\n\nYou a brat and entitled. You should pay for college yourself then you can go on this high and mighty entitlement of your life being so hard.", "YTA. You've been an undergrad for a few weeks, not working on your doctorate.

You watched 'Back to School', and suddenly you're an expert? \n\nYou were being naive and condescending.", "YTA. You're arrogant, self absorbed, and extremely rude.\n\nI do believe wholeheartedly that she didn't struggle as much as you though. Not because college was easier. Just because she was smarter and more capable of managing basic levels of responsibility. You don't seem up to the task.", "YTA\n\nYou think you're better than her because you're doing a STEM subject. \n\nYou're wrong.\n\nShe was incredibly understanding given the circumstances. You done fucked up son.", "YTA it was her birthday. The rest is semantics really. You forgot to wish her a happy birthday and did this big write up about being busy. Just apologize and move on. Moving away changes the dynamic but you can be totally selfish and in your own world for the people who support you.", "Yes, YTA. Way to sh*t on your mums experience, when she was trying to comfort you and let you know that she understands. \n\nUniversity is hard, whether an hour away or 12 hours away, whether studying sociology or chemistry. Maybe suffer in silence next time.", "YTA. Difficult to compare degrees and say one is harder than the other, but ignorant to say school was easier in the 80s. No internet, no google, no laptop to write papers or conduct research. Your time was spent in the library when not in class or lab. Didn't understand something, whelp no youtube videos or reddit to ask a question...had to hope the professor had office hours or classmates offered tutoring. \n\nWhile your experience is different to be sure, don't be dismissive of other's experiences and assume you have it harder. Everyone has struggles, life shouldn't be a competition of who struggled more.", "I see you have the freshman brat syndrome.  YTA, but this attitude of \"I know everything\" is kind of expected.  Calm down and apologize to your mom.", "YTA. You sound like an insufferable prick. College today is not much harder than in the 80s. Actually it\u2019s probably easier due to modern technology. Sexual harassment was also super common between male professors and female students so chances are high your mom was a victim. Also kiddo the first couple weeks of college are as easy as it\u2019s going to get to buckle up and get over yourself.", "YTA. You were a real brat to your mom for no reason. Grow up.", "Wow. YTA. Holy shit. Your mom and your friend are spot on: mean and condescending.", "YTA. I understand you are stressed out, but that's no way to speak to your mother. And yes, you are very condescending.

Maybe she did stop listening to you at some point - that was no reason to be as rude as your were. \n\nIt\u2019s a sign of maturity to realize that other people *have* gone through what you are going through.

Apologize to your mother you mean and condescending child.", "YTA\n\nYou know how we always joke about older people and the walk to school was always \"Uphill, both ways?\" Congratulations, you are now the obnoxious college student trope that acts like they are the only person who's ever been to college.", "YTA.\n\nWow, you're a terrible son. Your mom was trying to empathize with you and have a conversation, that's how you reacted?\n\n\\*I felt that she wasn't listening to me anymore\\*\n\nBecause she was talking? Yikes, you're going to great socially, I can tell.\n\nAlso, just to be clear, you were the one comparing your educations. She was relating to the experience of going to College.", "YTA.  Ah, yes.  The 56 year old just doesn't understand anything about life or experiences and you obviously comprehend soooo much more than she does.   Your mother is just sooooooo useless and took such easy classes that she obviously just can't stir her brain to keep up with you.   Don't be surprised if this comes back to bite you in the ass later on.", "YTA. while she went to school a while ago (when I did as well), and there are small differences, such as location, major, everyone's experience is different. Some people adjust better (and more quickly) than others, and for you to tell her that what she went through was NOT the same was pretty rude. And how do you know how college was back when she went? You made a lot of assumptions so I understand why she was upset with you.", "Grow up, get over yourself and apologize to your mother. YTA", "YTA and you need to get your stuff together.

You have new living quarters and roommates to adjust to. You have to do more on your own. It's the same experience regardless of distance or degree.  It sounds like rather than wanting her to understand how you were feeling, which she was demonstrating she did on some level, you wanted a pity party.", "YTA\n\nYour mom was trying to make conversation, college life is not that much different with a school out of state or an hour away.  IT's still dorms, roommates, learning to be away from home etc.  \n\nHer degree was not as difficult possibly, but still studies and labs and all the things.  Don't be condescending to your mother.

I get moms can be annoying and you don\u2019t always want to talk to them, but soon hoped you\u2019ll realize how much of your weight she\u2019s been carrying and be thankful for it.

I'm not impressed with you. If majoring in chemistry is so overwhelming that you can't remember your mom's birthday maybe you should switch to something easier, I've heard sociology is a cake walk.

What proof do you have that school was easier in the 80s?  What is difficult to one person is subjectively more or less difficult to another, so perhaps your Mother's sociology was just as challenging to her as chemistry is to you.

Idk why you\u2019re being so nit picky about it and mean to your mom.\n\nAnd no, sociology isn\u2019t an easier degree. It\u2019s different. For example in my circles I know a lot of STEM majors who could never ever handle a humanities degree and humanities majors who could never do STEM. They take different brains. \n\nAnd no university in the 80s wasn\u2019t easier. I think it\u2019s way easier now with constant access to the internet on our phones and detailed databases. You try writing a detailed sociology thesis with no online databases.", "YTA, in a way that sounds very much linked to your age and maturity.\n\nLook at what happened there: You forgot to call your mother for her birthday (!) and are in general more neglectful these days about calling her, which you explain by the big change you're going through with moving away to college (at a young age, too), and the increased study load. That's all pretty normal and understandable. Your mother let you off easy, and gave you a soft landing, by emphasizing her understanding of the transitions involved. You ... doubled down by being an AH about it! Even though what you were given is an easy way out when *you* messed up (in a minor way).\n\nYou're also wrong on the merits. There's absolutely no reason to think that studying sociology is any less hard than studying chemistry, and specifically that studying sociology was any less hard for your mother in her time than chemistry is for you now. (And I'm saying that as someone with a degree in physics.) Also, studying now is not through the board harder than studying then. There are commonalities and differences between your mother's higher education path and yours. She chose to emphasize commonalities. You insisted on being your own special snowflake and were being an AH about it.\n\nSure, once in a while we feel that someone else's narrative of how they understand what we're going through doesn't hit the mark. It's time to learn how to deal with this gracefully and see the bigger picture of what's going on.", "Yeah, getting a physics degree in the 80s was just a breeze without the internet, or proper graphing calculators, or Windows...& drawing all those graphs by hand & heading to the library to dig through ancient textbooks hoping for help on figuring out the surface area of a torus was so easy. /s\n\nAre you kidding me? YTA for this comment alone.", "Why are you in college studying chemistry now  when you have clearly studied sociology in the 80s. I mean, that can be the only explanation to you knowing exactly how hard studying sociology is and how hard studying in general was in the 80s.\n\nYTA - and so so so wrong. Maybe you should consider taking a minor in sociology because right now, you are seriously lacking in the social intelligence department. There you can learn that your experience of the world is in fact not unique at all. Perhaps you would also learn to ask your mother how her birthday was, after you had forgotten about it, instead of just talking about yourself.\n\nChemistry is harder than sociology for some people, while for others, chemistry is a hell of a lot easier than discussing complicated, vaguely, but at the same time oddly specific sociological theory and applying that to real life interactions. I'd take a trip to the chemistry lab over that any time.", "YTA  \n\n\nyou forgot, sorry, was \"too busy\" to remember her birthday, and also condescendingly scolded her for being too stupid, and unable to handle the much harder course you're in your first year of.  \n\n\nof course you're the asshole.", "Yes YTA but also you're a child so there's that.

That being said, having so much freedom feels pretty nice and the stuff I'm learning is interesting.\r\n\nI will admit that this new schedule has prevented me from calling my parents as much as they would like, but I honestly thought they\u2019d be more understanding. Apparently, I was wrong.\r\n\nMy mom (F56) called me this morning asking how my classes have been going and mentioning that I must be pretty busy since I forgot to call her yesterday (which was her birthday). I confirmed this and apologized to her. I had forgotten it was her birthday until later in the evening, and I sent her a quick text wishing her a happy birthday.\r\n\nShe accepted my apology and told me that it was okay, considering that moving away and starting college is already super stressful. I started telling her about my courses and their challenges, and how it is stressful. She listened, but I got a bit annoyed when she kept on saying things like \"I know\" and \"It was also difficult for me.\"\r\n\nShe began telling me about how she was so homesick when she started college back in the '80s and how she had weird roommates and such. I felt that she wasn\u2019t listening to me anymore, so I told her that our situations were pretty different and that she probably didn\u2019t understand as much as she thought.\r\n\nShe asked me how, so I told her that when she went to a college an hour away from her parents\u2019 house, while I moved to an out-of-state one. I also told her that her degree (sociology) wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as mine (chemistry), and that back in the '80s school was generally much easier.\r\n\nShe got defensive and said that it was reasonable for me to assume that and that I was being condescending. We argued a bit, and she told me that I was being na\u00efve. I was really frustrated at this stage, so I told her not to waste my time with useless conversations as I already had enough schoolwork.\r\n\nShe became really upset and left the call, which I also thought was immature. I was talking with my friend Jess (F18) about it later, and she said that I was being a little mean.\r\n\nAITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
