Neither of us want to get married, just bad family experiences there on both sides. We have always split expenses based on income. I make about twice what she makes before taxes so we split everything 60/40 (I get taxed a lot higher). A couple months ago her uncle who didn't have kids passed away and she unexpectedly got a few hundred thousand in cash +stocks. She had no idea this was coming and had only met him a few times in her life.\n\nWe split rent and all household items by income and have been talking before all of this about upgrading our furniture, mainly buying a king sized bed and new sectional. Before all this I would have expected to keep the current split of me paying the majority, its what we did for other common purchases. But since she just got this huge cash infusion I suggested we take that into consideration and at the very least make it 50/50. My partner got really mad about this and said I was being an AH trying to capitalize on her family's death and saying inheritance shouldn't ever be a factor. I wasn't asking for a percentage of her inheritance I just thought it should be part of the equation in how we split things that benefit both of us. Was I being an AH there?\n\nFor clarity, She makes about 65k a year in base salary with some sporadic bonuses. My salary is a set 120k. She inherited about $270k in cash and about 140k in stock. The expenses we have coming up that I was referring to will be around 2-3.5k depending on how nice of a bed/sectional we get.", "created_utc": 1678807962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r9bc3/aita_for_expecting_my_partners_inheritance_to_be/", "score": 343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not reported on \"income taxes\".

He makes significantly more than I do so it truly wasn\u2019t fair to do 50/50. I\u2019ll personally say, it\u2019s exhausting for everyone involved and causes unnecessary stress. We now have one bank account and our money is our money. We both notify each other when making large purchases. It\u2019s made everything way easier - and not because I made less and now get to spend whatever I want that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m the more frugal one of the bunch and really don\u2019t spend that much money. \n\nAnyways, my advice for the sake of your relationship, put less pressure on what percentage each of you owe and just act like a partnership where both partners contribute to the whole. There\u2019s a few studies on how a joint bank account overall makes couples less stressed.", "To answer your question: NAH.

Are your savings combined or separate, because I imagine they are separate, and that you are able to put away *much* more than she is each month due to how you split bills.

If so could that be factored in at a later date as earnings instead of current earnings.", "It\u2019s not an AH move to suggest it, but you do need to consider something. What she has is the equivalence to a savings. Now if she were able to easily replace that savings that she takes from to pay bills, you\u2019d have a point. But as it stands, I don\u2019t think she would be able to. At the most, if she receives any regular dividends from the stocks she inherited, I would talk to her about that being considered income to factor in. But as far as any liquid funds sitting in an account, that doesn\u2019t need to be touched. You\u2019re not entitled to her inheritance, and she needs to still live within her means. That inheritance could provide a huge safety net for her if your arrangement were to fall apart or if she loses her job or has to take a leave of absence from it due to illness or injury.", "No judgement, but if the inheritance is big enough to generate income, it would be fair to take that income into account when considering how to split bills.

They should be willing to put more in for one time expenses at this point.", "YTA - How are her retirement funds compared to yours?  You state there will be no marriage -- so who will inherit your estate when you go?  Is she the beneficiary on your life insurance?  Your GF has to look to her future without the protection of you being her husband -- she shouldn't have to use her inheritance to fund furniture purchases unless she wants to and feels her financial future is solid.", "I don't think it's unreasonable to ask her to contribute a little more based on that inheritance.

A bit of a flag there. \n\nNTA", "NTA I don\u2019t know why some people are acting like you\u2019re some kind of monster. Why shouldn\u2019t she split cost of the new furniture 50/50? Both of you are going to use it in your shared home. The only difference is that she has the cash that she just inherited and you will have to earn the money to pay your share. You aren\u2019t asking for half the inheritance. It is completely reasonable if you\u2019ve been paying a higher portion of the bills due to your income that she should at least cover half of the cost now that she has extra money. Honestly I would expect her to buy the furniture. When my partner and I bought our house I had extra money and guess what\u2026I just bought most of the furniture because why would I make him struggle to pay for half when I have the cash! People are so weird when it comes to money!", "YTA. 50/50 isn't fair at all, despite her windfall. Her year over year income is 65k. You shouldn't dip into stored funds to pay for your day to day lifestyle, it should be maintained by what you can actually make in a year.\n\n\\> I wasn't asking for a percentage of her inheritance I just thought it should be part of the equation in how we split things that benefit both of us.\n\nYou're literally asking her right here to get a percentage of her inheritance by increasing her percentage contributions.\n\nYou chose not to get married. Part of that is navigating the fact that you're separate people with separate financial lives and outcomes, and no financial protection for either of you should you break up. She would in fact be an idiot to dip into personal savings to pay for the lifestyle increases you want.\n\nYou didn't ask for an increase based on her previous life savings, investments, or retirement fund, you shouldn't ask for an increase based on her inheritance either.", "NAH. \n\nI can understand where your though process came from which is why I'm not counting you as the AH. But an inheritance is a lump sum, it's not a guaranteed income which is likely why she is defensive over it. It could be spending against a finite resource.\n\nI would sit down and ask her what the plan is for the inheritance. Is it going toward maxing out contributions for retirement savings? Long term investments? Establishing a family trust for future children?\n\nI do think it is a bit reasonable if she is establishing some of it as general savings to ask that she contribute more equitable to large household purchases.", "Bear in mind most countries tax inheritances, so that should be considered when determining value. And that also addresses the root issue here, because inheritances are taxed differently from income, which means even the government doesn't view those funds as standard income. \n\nBut also, if her parents gave her an expensive Christmas present, would you expect that to affext your cost sharing? I'm leaning towards YTA. You really need to think about all the scenarios that could prompt you to try to change your financial agreement, and you nees to discuss them with your partner before springing a claim on her.", "YTA\n\n> We have always split expenses based on income. \n\n> We split everything 60/40\n\n> She makes 65k a year in base salary with some sporadic bonuses.

As so many have said, an inheritance isn\u2019t income. It is not recurring. If she\u2019d had a substantial savings account when you moved in would you expect her to pay more?

You\u2019re not entitled to that.", "YTA but it doesn\u2019t really matter because she\u2019s absolutely going to leave you over it and is probably already making plans.

She had no idea this was coming and had only met him a few times in her life. \n\nWe split rent and all household items by income and have been talking before all of this about upgrading our furniture, mainly buying a king sized bed and new sectional. Before all this I would have expected to keep the current split of me paying the majority, its what we did for other common purchases. But since she just got this huge cash infusion I suggested we take that into consideration and at the very least make it 50/50. My partner got really mad about this and said I was being an AH trying to capitalize on her family's death and saying inheritance shouldn't ever be a factor. I wasn't asking for a percentage of her inheritance I just thought it should be part of the equation in how we split things that benefit both of us.

She hasn\u2019t had a chance yet to make those investments", "The interest on her $410K windfall should provide $15K + in annual income on average pretty easily without touching the principal, which would only be subject to capital gains tax. The agreement should be modified to account for that at the very least", "They have to do a deal.\n\nI think both parties are wrong here. She is more wrong as she is just saying my inheritance that's it. \n\nHe is wrong to say 50/50 imo but he is more willing to communicate here imo though that could be story teller bias.\n\nWith my ex we said that 4% of our pre relationship or inheritance investments would be income each year for the purpose of determining income as we felt we could get that as a return.", "I just started contributing to my 401k in the last year so she probably has more than me. Her parents paid for her college but I had a lot of loans and my company didnt match so for awhile I wasnt contributing to mine at all to try to pay down the loan balance. I dont know what either of our 401k balances are exactly. Ive been trying not to look at mine because it keeps going down with whats happened to the stock market in the last year.", "the whole point of dividing bills by income is to help the one who makes less money has they have a harder time with money, it's not because it's fair.\n\n\nFair is 50/50. So if a partner has a lot of money in savings they do not need the help of the higher income person therefore going to 50/50 is completely legit.", "Kind of? It's a material change in both of their financial positions. \n\nThe only reason that OP pays 60% now is that OP has a better financial position (because of the higher income).", "If I won the lottery Id want neither of us to ever work again and Id happily pay all the bills. I dont play the lottery though lol.", "Sorry, OP\u2019s partner. I\u2019m talking about people in a long term/committed relationship, which I would count OP\u2019s as being given what they\u2019ve described", "no, it wasn't, lol check the time stamp.", "Yes, but you (normally!) pay income tax on income from share dividends and interest gained from money in bank accounts. So the whole 400k inheritance wouldn\u2019t count towards OP\u2019s partner\u2019s income, but annual income arising from returns on that inheritance would.", ">But if you look at how tax law works, inheritance is not considered part of income tax\n\nThere are 6 states that count inheritance as taxable income though!", "The OP isn't even a man who tf are you talking about?\n\nInheritances aren't income, you could call interest from a saving account with the money in it income, if she sells some stocks or gets dividends from them you could call that income, buying a property and renting it with the money would be income, but just getting the sum isn't income.\n\nIf they switch to 50/50 (especially if this is growth stocks not dividends) and she's taking from the inheritance it will deplete. If she starts getting reoccurring income from this that shoots her up her yearly income, sure refigure the split, but until that point OP should get her nose out of it.", "Did you account for depreciation?", "> if a partner has a lot of money in savings\n\nSo if OP saved up a few hundred grand, that would entitle partner to ask for OP to pay for 70-80% of the bills? Just because of their savings?", "> a material change in both of their financial positions.\n\nExcept that it's really not, not any more than it would be if OP had saved up a few hundred grand in a savings account. When that money is gone, their financial position will be exactly where they both started. OP's financial position is extremely transitory. If they fix their house, or buy a car, or pay off student loans or whatever, that financial position goes right back to where it was.", "if the lottery was only a few hundred thousand you\u2019d still never be able to never work again. based on her income, her inheritance would pay for about 4.5 years of ONLY HER living expenses and that\u2019s it. i feel like maybe you\u2019re thinking this is a huge lump sum she can just spend, but it\u2019s really not in the grand scheme of things.", "I\u2019m talking if you won a comparable amount to her inheritance. You knew that was the question. Don\u2019t be obtuse", "Say OP\u2019s wife is making a 5% annual return on her 400k cash/shares. In that case it it would be perfectly fair to add $20k onto her employment income when working out how to split expenses going forward", "Yeah and once she starts earning that, that would make sense. But op is trying to change this before even a quarterly shared dividend would even pay out. It\u2019s only been a couple months. Once she\u2019s been able to evaluate how this will change her annual income, they can discuss this. But 50/50 is still unreasonable when she only earns 54% of op\u2019s annual salary. It\u2019s hugely unlikely these dividends will equate to $55k per year. The stocks only make up 170k", "That\u2019s a minority and us federal law does not consider it income tax", "OK.\n\nThe original post doesn't mention the OP's gender.\n\nWho cares if OP is a man or a woman or some other gender.", "you are never entitled to ask for more than 50%, obviously. But how does it make sense to have the person who has more money pay less percentage of bills????", "I had no idea that was what you meant. When I think about winning the lottery I think about winning millions of dollars. If I won 400k, sure Id factor it in. But ive never bought a lottery ticket and dont plan on starting to.", "Exactly! She would need to make $55k on her return for investment annually for 50/50 to make sense", "That seems fair enough (OP is also a woman btw!)\n\nKeep things as they are for now but once the dust has settled and investment decisions are made, OP and her partner should sit down together and calculate what the partner\u2019s new net income is taking into account the annual returns on what she inherited", "Of course - just pointing out some added complexities.\n\nIn general, pointing to tax laws will lead to frustratingly inconsistent results. OP could easily be living in a country where inheritance does count as taxable income. Should that really change everybody's answer?", "> how does it make sense to have the person who has more money pay less percentage of bills?\n\nIf OP makes 125k/yr and partner makes 65k/year, and given that partner only inherited 270k in cash, OP will have made more money than partner within five years. Partner happens to have more liquid capital right now, but is still not \"wealthier\" than the person who makes nearly twice as much money."]}
