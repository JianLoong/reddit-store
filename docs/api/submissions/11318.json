I also have two children (4F) who we can call Chloe (Fake name), and a baby boy (5months)\n\nAround 5 and half years ago one of our best friends had passed away from cancer, we had known him since we were like 9 so this hit us both hard. During this time, we argued a lot and we spent time away from eachother but eventually figured things out and realised we were better together.\n\nMaybe 2 weeks after we got back together, she told me that during our time apart she was with another man who happened to be someone who we both were friends with in highschool who we can call Jonah for the sake of the story. Now it was a bit upsetting at first but after some discussion we were able to accept it and move on. Another 2 weeks or so pass by and we find out she is pregnant.\n\nI know Ava isn't mine. I've known from the start and have accepted that fact. But I love her, she's my daughter and nothing will change that.\n\nWhen I looked into my daughters eyes for the first time it was heartbreaking to see the face of a man that I considered my friend for all those years. But I didn't tell anyone, not even my wife, until Ava was 2 years old. \n\nWhen I confronted her about it she admitted that was her fear because Ava honestly looks like a carbon copy of Jonah. She asked if I wanted a paternity test and I denied because I really am scared I could lose legal rights of my baby girl.\n\nThe past 4 years, she's been my girl. I love her more then words can describe and I got over that heartbreak so quickly. I love her and my son equally.\n\nHere where the issues start. Ever since my son was born, my family have started to question my daughters biology as my son looks just like my wife and I whereas my daughter looks nothing like either of us.\n\nMy mom recently came up to me and said I need to do paternity test for Ava as \"I can't have my boy raising a baby that isn't his.\" This really upset me but I kept my cool and just told my mom that Ava is my daughter. \n\nI never told her in the first place because she treats my sisters step son like crap and I don't want my girl to be treated like that.\n\nWell my mom was committed and went to my wife and managed to trick her into telling the truth. She came back over to me and yelled at me for raising an illegitimate child. \n\nWe left the situation fast but my mom hasn't stopped texting me about how I lied for 4 years and that my wife is a cheater.\n\nI explained to everyone after in a calm way that my wife didnt cheat and just went into a bit more depth. While my other family, besides my mom, don't care that she isn't mine, they are upset at me for keeping the information away for so long. But I personally think it was none of their buisness in the first place as my own daughter doesn't even know.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I said Chloe at the top but continued to use my daughter's real name. I'm in idiot but I still don't think its enough to give away our family identity so it's ok. Sorry about that I'm new to reddit\n\nEdit 2: So no Jonah has no idea about her. He's not safe. He has a child himself who I saw on his cousins Facebook. Jonah blocked us after my wife and I got back together. But he lived in my town for another 3 years so I heard news on him. Due to this subs rules I can't say what, but he is a very bad man from what I know hence why our friendship broke. He did stuff which should have him away for life but he isn't. He said stuff about children which absolutely deserves jail time for life. I fear for his child but I'm not putting my daughter in a situation where she could be badly hurt. I tried to keep it low-key in my post and comments about him but it's not possible to do that anymore as I would just seem like a selfish AH if I don't explain.

They've accepted my husband and our son \\[and daughter's bf\\] as their family too. \n\nMy in-laws have accepted me, my daughter, and the bf as their family.\n\nAnd all of the kids friends call me mom.\n\nOh... and I'm the financial supporter in all of this insanity. LOL. My husband was always a better stay at home parent. He does have sporadic work, but nothing that would sustain the entire family. He's currently looking for more solid work now that all the kids are older though. I just have more potential for higher paying work. He's still stuck in the 80s without an email, no social media, doesn't really operate a computer very well... \\[he's also almost 9 years older than me\\].", "Sorry, my mistake. I agree - all of that stuff is what makes you a dad. Keep it up, Dad!", "I\u2019m so heated that everyone is touting OP as a saint and good father. Um, yeah, because they didn\u2019t even give the bio dad a chance to be her parent???", "That's very true. Thank you I will definitely talk to a therapist about the whole situation", "That's actually a good idea", "I don\u2019t think so. OP commented somewhere that \u201cif the bio dad ever found out\u2026\u201d so I\u2019m guessing not. Which is seriously messed up", "I just made a comment about this but I think it\u2019s disgusting if they hid this from Jonah for the sake of saving their marriage. If Jonah isn\u2019t abusive and didn\u2019t even know he had this child, OP and his wife should be raked over the coals for that.", "No he's not a good man. He has a child of his own but the man I knew a couple years back I would not ever trust with the knowledge he has a daughter. This man has done disgusting things, I fear for his child that lives with him.", "It's not just that he wouldn't want her. He's also a bad person from what I know and I have no way of knowing now how he is. If I could see he was a changed man I would of looked at these comments and agreed that he should of known. But when I told my wife, my daughter was 2 and already had parents plus knowing the stuff he was doing at the time, it was not safe to let him know about an innocent baby", "No", "That's why I refused to do a DNA test because I don't want to ever take the risk of losing her. We don't talk to \"Jonah\" and he has his own life with a son of his own now. So I think we are in the clear for a demanded DNA test.\n\nThank you, I agree she's my daughter all the way", "Not all US states are like this, but I know for a fact that Michigan \\[and several other states\\] are like this. The hospital tried putting my ex on the birth certificate, because I couldn't produce my divorce papers while in labor with my son. It was insane. I had my daughter \\[child with my ex\\] in that hospital, so that's what the records showed for them.", "That\u2019s more than a concern, it\u2019s a huge violation and OP should not be touted as a good guy for his actions. What they did to Jonah was deplorable and wrong on every level. They didn\u2019t tell this man he has a child because they wanted to hold onto their marriage. Selfish beyond belief.", "Yes this!!!! 100 percent. Also there's a lot of wait lists for therapists for children post covid (many many school aged kids really struggled in the pandemic) so getting her in now is critical. Therapy isn't bad for anyone especially kids. She doesn't need to go every week, even a once a month checkin would help. The therapist will also be able to help you tell her the truth and how to do it and when.", "Right and OP is trying to justifying it by saying he has a son now. So not only is he withholding a relationship with her bio dad but also her half brother", "He should never be given a chance to raise her considering the stuff he's done.", "We weren't friends anymore for a reason", "Yes! A therapist will tell you guys how to navigate this in a way that won\u2019t traumatize your daughter. \n\nI will say that you should do a paternity test just in case. Genetics are WEIRD like that. None of my kids have my dark skin but I did manage to pass blue eyes to 1 of them. I also don\u2019t have dyslexia but all my kids do. Don\u2019t make such a monumental decision to tell your child that she\u2019s not yours without proof. I\u2019m sure you guys are right but just in case\u2026", "It's not all for saving our marriage. We would still be married. I'm shocked Jonah has a child himself that he raises because that man is not safe", "That\u2019s horrible. You and your wife should be ashamed. Yes maybe you are a great dad to Ava. But what happens when Ava gets older, you tell her about her birth father, and she resents the fact you didn\u2019t even tell the man he has a child. You are playing with FIRE. and not telling this man he has a child is one way to get burned. Imagine if you were in his shoes and you had a child you didn\u2019t even get the opportunity to know about. Better hope mom doesn\u2019t spill the beans.", "I feae for his sons safety", "She's his literal twin lol. It's insane. I would definitely do one for double confirmation but I want to go about it to make sure I won't have a chance at losing my rights to my child", "Please read other comments explaining why I haven't told him. It's not safe as far as I'm concerned for her to be with him", "If you're in the US and your name is on the birth certificate then you are the legal father.", "If I'm not mistaken, if Jonah finds out and somehow wants rights and to take them from me, he can right?", "Yes, but it would be years of court proceedings to do so. That's the only way is if he takes it to court. And that doesn't guarantee that he would win.", "NTA \nDo not do a paternity test and cut your mother out of your life for everyone\u2019s sake. She has already been toxic to your sister\u2019s step child that would be enough, but include the comments she\u2019s made about/ to you and your little girl is vile and disgusting. It is only going to get worse. I\u2019ve a blood uncle who I wouldn\u2019t pee on if he was on fire. I\u2019ve a \u201ccousin\u201d who is no blood relative at all but I would gladly step in front of a bullet for them. A loving family doesn\u2019t need blood to connect you.", "If you know & are fine with it, that\u2019s all that matters. I have issues with women who know the truth & trick their partners into fatherhood, but this isn\u2019t the case. I love that you love Ava so much. \ud83d\udc97 NTA", "NTA.  She is your daughter.  That\u2019s all they need to know.", "With the way your mother reacted, it's not like you can tell yourself that you were worrying for nothing.", "I'm kind of amazed that the wife is able to hook up two weeks with Jonah right after the split. That sounds fishy.\n\nYou are rich you're going to have to tell your daughter because your mom's going to open her mouth the rest of your family are sometime going to open their mouth and soul the secret.\n\nYou're doing a great thing treating her like your daughter because she is. But just be prepared for when the truth comes out.\n\nNta", "NTA, good on you for being a better man than I could ever be, but quick question, you and your wife were officially broken up and that relationship was totally over when she slept with Jonah?", "It sounds like Jonah is a child predator to me. Stay NC. He doesn't deserve anything.", "OP: Did I read correctly that the biological father doesn\u2019t know?", "She's my little angel girl always \u2764\ufe0f", "Read the whole thing before you say something like this.", "She needed to feel something. She's admitted to all her wrongs. I did stuff too", "We were broken up but said we would reevaluate soon. So she didn't cheat. But I was only upset because of who she was with during that time", "Yes.  When you have the how a baby is made convesation - egg and sperm make a baby.  You can have mummy and daddy are the people who love and look after the baby conversation.  The egg mummy and sperm daddy don't have to be the baby mommy and daddy.\n\nYou aren't her sperm daddy, but you are her daddy because you love her and look after her.\n\nA four year old can get that.", "It's especially relevant when she's young because she can deal with it better then. When she is older and learns the truth, she must first restructure her worldview. It sounds logical for an adult to tell later because she can't quite grasp it yet, but it's not the best method for children. It would be much easier for her if she grew up in the normality of having a biological father and a social father.", "Have you ever heard the expression \u201ctwo can keep a secret if one of them is dead\u201d? Way too many people know now including all of your family. As bad of a guy as you say Jonah is, he seems to not be in jail and the courts have allowed him to raise a kid, which to me rules out some of the worst crimes I can think of at this point. Ultimately Ava is not just \u201cyour\u201d baby, she has a biological father involved, and at some point this is all going to blow up in your face unless you tell her in advance.", "INFO: what did he do that was awful, for context?", ">Jonah wants nothing to do with us.\n\nDoes that include *his daughter*? Because so far you haven't told us why he's so unfit to be a parent.", "I'm sorry it's such a mess and that it's causing you anguish and shit. I seriously believe you have nothing to worry about as far as losing your daughter, but yeah, unfortunately there will need to be a talk. And wtf was your wife thinking? She must've known his history as well.", "\u2026 you \u201cheard a story\u201d and decided that this man should not have any chance to have a relationship with his biological child? This man who has \u201calways been a bad man\u201d but was also your friend for \u201call these years\u201d? \n\nsomethings not adding up\u2026\n\nINFO: how is he supposed to prove he\u2019s a changed man when you have no contact with him (i\u2019m assuming) since you only know he has a son (and your daughter another brother, btw) from a photo?", "Sorry bout that. I'm an idiot who forgot I was sharing this to people who don't know us rather then people who do know us and our daughter", "Read the whole thing before you say something like this.", "He's done the shit you might be thinking. They have no evidence for this. He's served jail time before but not for long enough. The way he has a baby is beyond me. Trust me the stuff bad but the evidence isn't there. We were friends and he told me stuff", "I cant say too much as I don't think the sub allows it. But he was a threat to children based on the stuff he talked about which contained them and also r worded women.", "I cant say on this sub or comments as it is very violent. But he was a r word and posed a very big threat to children's safety. If you really want to know you can PM me", "She did and she admitted to me in private that she was fucked up to do that. But our friend was like a brother to us and their death made us both go off the rails. She didn't care at that point and wanted to feel something", "Read the whole thing. It sounds like he's a child predator to me.", "My wife was at a point in her life that she didn't care because of the situation. Trust me the stuff I know about him would literally change people's whole perspective. Ava is very much not safe. And sadly her being a female makes it even more unsafe", "My sister and BIL told started telling my niece when she was about two that she is adopted.  She fully knew and understood by the time she was four (this child is scary smart) and it didn't bother her when she was younger, but now that she has hit double digits, some of the (according to her therapist) typical anxiety symptoms and behavioral issues have started cropping up. \n\nEither way, you're a stellar parent.  Best of luck to you all.", "He didn\u2019t update the post until after I told him to update the post.", "1000% NTA. Hide your daughter.", "I am sorry for your loss, btw. And your wife showed remorse so that's good. You got a beautiful daughter out of the deal and you worked things out. That's a win in my book.", "in that case, you really should not be saying all of this with her real name on here. Plenty of posts on here go viral, end up on tiktok, etc.", "Then edit that into your post because your comments and post 100% don\u2019t give any reason why you wouldn\u2019t tell him he has a child.", "Read the whole thing before you say things like this.", "I did. We don't regret a thing because my daughter is only who she is because of everything. She may be the twin of her bio dad who is the ugliest person inside. But I think she's the most beautiful girl on this planet. I wouldn't change a thing about her", "I didn't mean to put her name out there. He has no idea Ava exist or even that my wife and I have a child. So I honestly don't think he would be able to find out. Me and my wife don't really do social media. If he manages to figure out it's about us then I will be shocked", "This was before his edit. Still doesn\u2019t change the fact that this man not knowing he has a child could come back to really screw the family over. Asking a lawyer about a hypothetical situation could help. Therapy helps.", "You're both to be commended for making it work, not many would given the circumstances. Love and light to all o y'all!", "NTA, it's no one's business but yours and your wife's.\n\nHowever, PLEASE tell me your mother doesn't know and has no way of figuring out who Ava's bio father is. If he's as bad as he sounds from the hints you've given, I'd be terrified of her trying to find out and telling him.", "NTA. The details of your marriage are nobody's business. The details of your daughter's conception are nobody's business. \n\nFWIW, my daughter was conceived using a private donor. She's always known we used someone else's sperm (\"seeds\" since we told her from a very young age) to make her. It's never been a big deal for her and she's always understood that Dad is her dad.", "NTA. There's a nice saying to remember when dealing with your mom.\n\n\"There's no such thing as an illegitimate child. Only illegitimate parents.\"\n\nOP, you sir, sound very much like a legitimate parent.", "NTA\n\n>I never told her in the first place because she treats my sisters step son like crap and I don't want my girl to be treated like that.\n\nSo why didn't you cut contact with her after this? Or started distancing yourself? Keeping the same distance as before is just going to make your daughter suffer. When you realised your mother would torment your daughter because she isn't biologically yours you should have started taking steps to limit contact between the two because it most likely will come out.", "NTA. If you both know her paternity and you accepted her as yours, she\u2019s yours.   However, the suggestions for talking with a therapist on how to mitigate your mom\u2019s negative narrative is important.   It\u2019s amazing what young kids can sense, and how they internalize it.  Protect her as much as possible from that!   \nAs for the \u201csperm donor\u201d issue.   Please get some legal advice.   It may seem like he would never find out if you don\u2019t say anything, but life has a way of screwing things up.   Knowing how to best protect yourself and her legally could save you guys if something happens down the line.  Legal counsel has to follow confidentiality laws so they wouldn\u2019t tell/ force you to tell \u201cJonah.\u201d\nGood luck and keep focused on the love you have for that sweet girl!  It will get you through this!", "She has no clue who he is as I lived with my father during my highschool days sadly he passed a few years ago. My mom has never met any of my friends like that and never knew any of them. So she has no way of knowing who he is", "I like the idea of explaining it like that and just having her grow up that way.", "I never thought It would come out because we never gave no indication ever that there was a chance she wasn't mine. Our families didn't even know we broke up at one point. They had no reason to suspect her biology", "If you present stuff like this young, it\u2019s normal. If you hide it forever, it\u2019s not. Idk if I\u2019d tell her unless you do a DNA test and know for *sure* though.", "I think maybe if a therapist says to do it sooner then do it sooner.....I know of someone who grew up with her father's wife calling her illegitimate every chance she got and it was horrible for her....your mom unfortunately sounds like the person to do this to Ava. So kindly figure out how to get ahead of it while ensuring it's in the best way for Ava.", "Good. As harsh as it sounds, I'd say you need to cut her out of your life completely, and anyone else who tries to pry and get it out of you.\n\nYou're a good man and a good dad and I wish you and your family all the best \u2764\ufe0f", "If both you and your wife could see she looked nothing like you, so could your mother. She would have suspicions on her biology as she grows.", "Damn, that's genius. Well done.", "I heard a story about 2 years ago. We stopped being friends many years ago but he was around everywhere and he did awful things when we were still friends and he even told me not that many years ago some more shit. We got him out of lives for reason. After much weird info. It's a small area we live in and it's not that uncommon to run into a pal from highschool. He's disgusting but we were too immature to fully realise until we got older", "Well she doesn't look like us in ways that our son does but like she looks like a regular kid. I mean we both have brown eyes and our hair was slightly blonde when I was a child so when around our family we joked how she \"got it from me\". Since they don't know the bio dad they don't know that she is his clone. She looks like a standard little girl nothing more lol", "Read the rest of the OP's comments. If he's telling the truth, there's a very good reason why Jonah doesn't know he's the father.", "Yes, which he had made no indication of in the slightest at the time I made this comment. I\u2019ve edited my original judgement comment to reflect this info and encouraged the OP to edit his post  after messaging him privately about what Jonah had done.", "Apologies, I didn't see your judgement comment. I'm... Not going to ask. I just hope his mother doesn't figure out who Jonah is or there could be huge problems.", "Ask a lawyer in your area, not random redditors please!"]}
