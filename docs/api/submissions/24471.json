{"id": 24471, "submission_id": "15oznot", "title": "WIBTA If I tell my mother what my Brother\u2019s gf said to me?", "selftext": "I (20f) have an older brother (26m), which is currently dating his gf of almost two years. I\u2019ll call her Missy.\n\nI haven\u2019t met Missy a lot because they usually meet at his apartment, but I always wished to form a good relationship with her (I\u2019m the youngest of two brothers). I believe that in total, I\u2019ve only seen her around 3 times, during those two years.\n\nTwo weeks ago, for my father\u2019s birthday, we booked a table at a nice restaurant. We invited Missy as we always do (she always rejects our invites, says she\u2019s either busy with university or made plans in advance), but this time she accepted the invite.\n\nI won\u2019t get into the little details, but at certain point my parents and the eldest brother went to the patio for a smoke and I stayed with my brother and Missy. I was the one to initiate the conversation, and we moved from topic to topic until we ended up talking about the idea of marriage and having kids. Missy said she wants kids in the future, and I replied that if it happens to be with my brother then I\u2019d be overjoyed to be an aunt. She laughed and said she\u2019s rather not have a [the worst type of offender] near their kids.\n\nNow, I love dark humor. I cannot be bothered by the darkest of jokes. And I want to clarify that while I didn\u2019t meet Missy a lot, it is a known gig that I have that kind of humor. But everyone who knows me, knows that jokes about children are a big no for me. For personal, and I guess, pretty obvious reasons. My brother knows it too, and he knows why. Regardless, he laughed with her.\n\nI was mortified but kept calm, mainly to keep up the image that \u201cI\u2019m unbothered\u201d. But I\u2019ve been carrying it for two weeks and I somehow expected my brother to approach me and apologize for her. And to be honest, I\u2019d accept it.\n\nThat entire conversation felt as if I\u2019m being mocked by her. But I\u2019m ambivalent since I\u2019ve only met her 4 times, and I might misread her character. Even so, who says that?\n\nRegardless of her behavior, I am in a position where I want to share this information with my parents (they have no clue), but I suspect that doing so will open a can of worms which WILL lead to a big argument. With how tense things are at home right now, I fear that speaking about it won\u2019t necessarily benefit anyone, as my brother will most likely not break up with Missy but instead cut connections with us. At least for a while.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I speak to my mom about it? And potentially create chaos?\n\nEDIT: As suggested, I\u2019ll clarify that it was aimed at me. Although some people suggest it was an accusation, there\u2019s no actual reason for it to even be considered. And for those who suggest my brother said something about my own experiences\u2026 I\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt, cause if so, that would be too cruel and he is not like that at all.\n\nI personally feel like Missy has a vendetta against me, and maybe with my family as well considering she avoids us at all costs, but I don\u2019t want to just accuse her of that cause it\u2019s unfair. There\u2019s always the chance she wanted to be witty and thought I\u2019d appreciate the joke, and had no idea it was a big deal for me, and that I purposely avoid making those jokes. And that\u2019s why I want to talk to my mom\u2014 she\u2019s my go to therapist. But I\u2019m scared she would blow up because she\u2019s very protective of me.\n\nEDIT 2: I do identify with the LGBTQ+ community, but my brother is openly Bi and I can\u2019t really imagine she would be so bold to tease/stab me with such comment in front of him if it was aimed at me from a homophobic standpoint. That\u2019s my opinion as for now\u2026\n\nEDIT 3: TW\n\nI find it somewhat fascinating how most of the comments perfectly understood why I was withholding this information, and the others are aiming guns. In the first draft of the post I had more details but it was removed and I was warned because it violated the subreddit rules. I had to remove everything related to it.\n\nI think the safest way to explain it without getting my comment deleted is that I was at the receiving end of this type of behavior \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNOTE in case it\u2019s necessary, I\u2019m safe and well now.
