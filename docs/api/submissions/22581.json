This was obviously a deliberate move on the man's part. People here keep saying it's, \"weird,\" but it's really him that was rude. He did this to deliberately make you feel uncomfortable. Why didn't your friend care about that? Are you female? If so it was a clear case of harassment. \n\nPlus you said nothing, so how were you rude? You simply moved. All he knew you moved because you're claustrophobic and don't like feeling hemmed in.\n\nShame on your \"friend\" for not supporting you!", "NTA.  Weird that someone would pointedly come sit next to you in an empty theater.", "NTA- you did not tell the others to move, they chose to follow you.  I dont want strangers sitting next to me either when there are MANY other places they can sit.", "NTA\n\nUnless you know the person, it super weird for someone to see you and then randomly come and sit you with you.", "NTA That was bizarre. I mean, it would be different if you were in the middle viewing section (as you said) but you werent. AND to sit RIGHT next to you, without even one seat between you. Nope! I would have moved too.", "NTA. There is no reason for him to have moved to sit directly next to OP. And moving to another seat without saying anything negative to this guy is fine. Sounds kind of creepy as well", "NTA.. That stranger was weird for that. Id have moved too", "NTA. You didn\u2019t yell or confront the person who sat next to you. You simply got up and sat elsewhere. Honestly if someone looked at me then sat next to me in an empty theater I\u2019d think they were up to some nonsense. That person was being intentionally weird.", "nta CREEP", "NTA that's really weird and you handled it well.", "NTA.  People who sit right next to strangers when it's not necessary are rude.   People who behave rudely get treated rudely in response.", "NTA! It is super weird and I hate when people do that on public transportation too. I don't blame you for moving. I would've done the same.", "NTA. You handled it perfectly and cordially", "Not rude.  You refused to allow him to make you feel awkward during the movie.   NTA", "NTA. I don't get why people do this!!! It's so cringey.\n\nLike a whole entire empty row of treadmills but you have to choose the one next to me??", "NTA. He broke the unspoken rules.

But our job had power issues and we were running on a generator. Eventually they just let us go home and this was only three hours into my shift. So me and my coworkers that are my friends decided to go to see a movie. It was the middle of the weak and it was 12:30pm so the theater was basically empty. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis theater doesn't do assigned seating unless it's a major film premier or night/weekend. But we were seeing a smaller film so we just got tickets and went in. It was me(21m) and three other coworkers(20f,20m21f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheater was empty and we were there a bit early and nobody came so we thought it'd be an empty theater. Almost right after previews this guy walked in and was about to sit down in the middleish area. We were all in the far back and on the far right so he didn't even notice us at first until he looked up. He was about to take his seat then looked at us and then picked his stuff back up and went to sit right by me. I think we can all relate to how annoying this is. We've all been to a theater before that was nearly empty and someone decides to sit way close to you for some reason. I understand if we are sitting in an optimal viewing position though. It's the same vibes as being on an empty bus and someone gets right by you.  But in this case I know it wasn't to see better because he was about it sit and decided to move when he saw us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow this is where I feel like I COULD be the asshole. Because I can be blunt and direct. We all work in a grocery store prepared foods/deli section and whenever there is an annoying/rude/difficult customer. They will come get me and let me handle it because I don't care and will be direct and end the interaction as bluntly as possible. So I know that sometimes I can be a dick without thinking about it. This is a thing I have done before. Nearly any time in a empty bus/theater I will move if sat next to. The moment he sat down I stood up and moved a few rows down and to the other side. My friends followed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter the movie my friend(20m) said that was really rude and we looked like assholes. My other friends didn't care and were glad we moved. I said \"it's weird to sit right next to people in an empty theater\" and he said that guy probably feels bad. I said \"well you could have stayed next to him if you wanted.\" I don't think this was particularly rude. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA \n\n\nI would have started coughing", "NTA, it\u2019s so weird when people do that and I would move too. I absolutely hate it when random people sit next to me when there\u2019s plenty of seats available and I will always move every time. \n\nDon\u2019t wanna be treated like a creep? Don\u2019t be one. Simple.", "It\u2019s not lost on me that the only other guy with OP is also the only person who thought *they* were the rude ones. I\u2019m sure the women were happy OP initiated the shift. \n\nNTA. Why should you care what a stranger who has no idea who are things of you?", "It is weird. If OP was a woman with other women, it would be commonplace behavior. Or even if he was alone.\n\nThis really kicked it up a notch.", "He's got rejection sensitivity and relates to the weirdo.", "For real I\u2019m like was this a group of young females and this man a creep? Hard to surmise why he would instantly change is choice of seating upon noticing them", "You are going a way too far. There are other reasons for his behavior that do not include him being a predator. Not every one is neurotypical.", "Lol did your parents have a single propeller on top and one perpendicular propeller on the tail?", "First paragraph agree. Second paragraph... have you ever tried going to the movies alone? It can be super fun. I don't do it often, but I used to go to movies by myself that my friends/family weren't interested in/couldn't make. I watched Endgame this way and it was awesome. Are you the kind of person who looks down on someone for going out to eat alone too?", "I love going to the theatre alone, personally, especially if I am able to go during the week. It's fantastic to be able to go alone. It doesn't indicate loneliness, either. You get to work on your schedule, chill out, and it's not like you'll be socializing during the movie, anyway. Sometimes, it's nice to treat yourself to a solo date. I highly suggest giving it a try. I used to get anxious about going to see a movie alone. Now, I couldn't get enough of it.", "I used to go to the movies alone all the time! I have anxiety so it was hard at first but great. I was in college and had a schedule that was very free, my classes were to write 40 page papers so not a lot of in class time. I saw everything I wanted to at matinee prices.\n\nI didn't sit next to people if the screening wasn't full though. But I know in several countries outside of the US sitting next to someone on the bus or at movie theatre when there are empty seats is totally normal. So maybe they are lonely or maybe they don't have friends who want to see the movie or maybe they thought nothing of it.", ">You don't need reddit to figure out if you can   \n>  \n>move seats at a theatre.\n\nIt's nice to get a break from parentified pre-teens, overbearing MILs, and crappy wedding guests.", "This happens to me a lot with old people at the grocery store.   They are speeding down the main aisle until they see you there and have to browse exactly what you're shopping for.", "Yeah, I've done it a few times. \n\nBut have you ever walked into a theatre in the middle of the day and sat next to the only other people in the theatre? \n\nThere's a clear social etiquette here and sitting directly next to someone in an empty theatre is wildly transgressive.\n\nNothing in the world could make me do that. I would rather walk out of the theatre than do that.\n\nAnd I'm wondering about the person that does do that. I didn't mean it to be negative, particularly. it's just so far from what I would do."]}
