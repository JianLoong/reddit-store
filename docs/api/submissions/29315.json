If you do lose things all the time consider losing him.", "People who do not wear headphones when sharing space are assholes...\n\nMy roommate felt threatened with me and my husband possibly moving out, and had the *audacity* to be upset when we said a big factor of the reason being how loud he is when we're *trying to sleep*. (Gamer livestreams where the gamer is *shouting the whole time*, LOUDLY SHOUTING on Discord with people, refuses to close his door, gets mad when we close it while trying to sleep, the works...) \n\nHe's since started wearing headphones but still shouts on Discord. So... Progress?\n\nTake it from me, someone who lived with this for a while: If they don't see what they're doing as wrong, they don't change their behavior. It might be fine *now*, but it can become disruptive for things like sleep very quick. You need to tell him either get a hook or something to keep his headphones on when not using them, keep some spares where he normally is, or turn the volume down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "He is 20 years old.

Blare him something back. Opera, reggae, an old Sherlock Holmes audiobook. Every. Damn. Time. \n\nActually, no. Do what the other commenter said and date an adult. I can\u2019t believe at the age of 20 that he doesn\u2019t see how annoying this is.", "No, Your NTA. People who don't care if everyone in the area can hear their conversations and\\\\or what they are doing on their phones are very inconsiderate and don't think of others.  Are you sure you two are compatible because he sounds very immature?", "NTA.\n\nI cant think more immature responses that he's giving. Also its not minuscule thing to be annoyed, something inside me starts boiling after a solid minute when my co-worker does this. I couldnt live with someone doing this lol.", "even if we agree it\u2019s not his fault he doesn\u2019t know where his headphones are (i, for one, do not) we can all agree it *is* his fault he hadn\u2019t turned the sound off. so that\u2019s annoying. but his reaction to being asked not to blare tiktoks in a shared space is way worse, and the fact he\u2019s got you doubting yourself is a very bad sign for where this relationship is going. nta.", "You are only the ass to yourself for trying to play grown-ups with someone's child.  Move on and let him have his tiktoks, and can be in a relationship with an adult.", "NTA. This would annoy me so much. The fact he's not even compromising and turning the volume down low and not completely off shows how immature he is. \n\nHe's upset that you're talking to him like a child when he's the one behaving like a child. I don't think I could put up with the constant disrespect tbh.", "In my personal opinion NTA, when I see people doing this in a public place I wanna grab their phone and smash/throw it away. It\u2019s disrespectful and rude, especially in front of your partner ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY ASKED SEVERAL TIMES.", "He sounds like an idiot", "do you live with this child? Because i would just go home", "As a side night, a romantic partner who scrolls through social media for \u201cages\u201d sounds exceedingly unattractive.", "Is he a middle aged father?", "ESH. \n\nHe\u2019s allowed to exist. You are allowed to exist. You have options. Go into a different room. Buy him new headphones. \n\nHe should be more considerate. He could buy new headphones.", "I'm honestly a little torn. Yeah, muting the sound or figuring out where his headphones are is the nice thing to do. That said, it is presumably his space as well? If my gf was watching TV while I was reading, I don't know that it is fair to expect her to put headphones on or mute the show. Probably depends what each of you are doing in this context. I'll say NTA, but really this just seems like something that shouldn't be a major argument in the first place so take that as you will.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thankfully he's not an asshole so not a problem for us.", "That's beyond annoying.

There have been quite a few times where he\u2019s acted selfishly and genuinely can\u2019t understand that he\u2019s done anything wrong though, it\u2019s like I\u2019m dealing with a totally different person. He\u2019s a very sensitive person as well so it\u2019s hard to talk to him about things without seeming like I\u2019m being hypercritical and upsetting him :(", "Thank you lol it just makes me so irrationally angry and I feel kind of ridiculous for it", "He seems to think it\u2019s different because we\u2019re not in public lol", "Because he doesn\u2019t want to seem disrespectful in public but has no problem disrespecting you. Think about that. He has the capacity to be behaved in front of other but couldn\u2019t give a shit about your feelings. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t just the headphones. You just haven\u2019t realized it yet", "So he thinks you don't deserve as much consideration as total strangers do? What a prince...\nI must admit that this kind of phone behaviour is one of those things that really sets me off. If I ever get arrested for violence it will probably be because I snapped and tried to insert someone's phone into their rear. Sideways!"]}
