Suzie is a very sweet child who rarely gets into trouble. Anyways one day Ashley and Suzie were out having a girl's nights with Ashley's mother and I was out with my brother for some drinks. When I got home that night I noticed that they haven't made it so I decided to take a shower and watch a movie. During that movie I started hearing strange noises. So me being a \"Manly Man\" I went to investigate. I opened the door to our room and looked in the hallway but didn't see anything so I let it go and went back to my movie. A few minutes later I heard it again and went to check again only this time I actually went into the hallway. As I'm walking towards the living room, I hear foot steps behind me and turn around only to see a tiny Chucky doll doll with a knife running towards me. I screamed and swore... \"M*****F****** B****.\" and ran only to trip and bang my knees on the floor. This time I yelled  \"S*** that F******* hurt!!\" Then Ashley comes around the corner laughing and 'chucky' takes the mask off to reveal our daughter also laughing. \n\nSo that was the origin story, the problem now is that Suzie won't stop swearing. We've tried to get her to stop but now we're getting phone calls from her school. One teacher in particular said that Suzie learned those words because \"My daddy screamed them at me.\" (That was a whole entire mess to deal with, I'm sure you can imagine what they thought of us.) My wife is angry with me telling me this is all my fault and that our family is being embarrassed and that she is being called a horrible mother because of it. \n\nAnd before rumors start, no we do not curse around our daughter. She only started swearing after the incident. Also I will take any advice on how to get her to stop.", "created_utc": 1668508019, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvt7zi/aita_for_swearing_at_my_child/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure that as a parent of a young kid you feel like an arsehole about a lot of things - guilt goes with the territory - but you're clear on this one.", "NTA.\n\nAs for how to nip this problem in the bud, show your daughter a goodie bag, with all kinds of her favorite treats inside of it.  Tell her that every time you, your wife, or her teacher hears a swear word from her, something will come out of the bag.  At the end of the week, what she's left with is what's left in the bag.\n\nYou could also tell her that it's an adult word that you don't want to hear coming out of her mouth. Say it calmly but very seriously.  Give her the \"I mean business\" look as you instruct her.  \n\n\"Some words aren't for children to say.  You are not to repeat them if you hear them. If you really want to say them, do it when you're alone in your bedroom.\"\n\nAlso you could institute time outs, earlier bed times, and a loss of junk food snacks if she continues.

Calmly say \"those words aren't polite, if you want to say them do it in the bathroom\" - or some other private place.  Every kid learns swear words at some point.  They also need to learn when they are not appropriate.   Teach your kids alternative exclamations and enrich their vocabulary with appropriate words by reading to them.   There are many alternative exclamations which are equally funny but not offensive.\n\nYou gave these words huge value by shouting them excitedly and laughing, so it will take some extended effort to extinguish the charge of saying them.      \n\nNAH - its so easy to slip up, they can learn it from one exposure, and it is funny so its hard not to reinforce it with laughing.\n\nPersonally I don't like calling words bad.

When little kids cling to words that get a reaction they'll keep using it. You'll need to talk with your daughter about appropriate use of words and 'adult' words like you used and why you used them and why she shouldn't. At 6 that's quite difficult, I had that with my son around age 9/10 so he had more understanding.\n\nYour wife being mad comes across as her frustration that your daughter is using those words at school, which is unfortunately going to be embarrassing for both of you. \n\nIt was a fun prank though, they really got you.", "Nta\n\nThis happens all the time, unfortunately children repeat everything they hear (especially the stuff they shouldn\u2019t). Your wife has no right to blame you, it was an accident and will blow over soon. People should not be calling you bad parents for it.", "This is all your fault??

She arranged the prank and now these are the consequences.  Your daughter thought the whole thing was funny including the FUNNY words daddy was saying.

I play practical jokes on my roommate and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that and she got you good!", "NAH. You said some words in a moment of shock and a second moment of pain. Your wife is embarrassed; it\u2019s natural\u2026 many parents would be in the same circumstances. Your daughter is doing normal kid things when they learn new taboo words. There\u2019s no blame to be placed here, just an unfortunate situation to deal with, ideally as a team.\n\nEdit to ask for INFO: Your story isn\u2019t 100% clear; I interpreted it to mean that Suzie was wearing the mask trying to scare you but a quick glance at the other comments (granted there aren\u2019t many at the moment), others seem to have inferred that Ashley was pulling the prank (several \u201cyour wife caused this\u201d comments).

In my house words are like beverages, there are different levels you get access to as you get older. Sit your daughter down and explain that those words are like beer. She can't use them until she old enough to be responsible with them. As for your wife? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\nI try my hardest not to swear, but let\u2019s face it, I swore like a sailor before my kid came in to this world and it\u2019s been hard to not let one slip when I\u2019m super stressed/angry.\n\nThis will be something you can look back on and laugh about, but for now the best advice I can give you is ignore it.  Don\u2019t react. Any reaction, positive or negative, is a reaction and it draws more attention to it. If you ignore it the novelty of it will wear off.\n\nWith your kid being 6, she may understand if you told her \u201cthis is a mommy daddy word, please don\u2019t say it again\u201d.", "NTA, and some advice, when my child swore at that age we'd get down on his level and asked if there was something wrong.

This MADE MY DAY!  I love to play practical jokes and this is hilarious. Sorry your daughter is getting in trouble but its not that serious. Tell everyone to simmer down.", "NTA, I think the reason Suzie swears is that she associates those swear words with the fun and excitement she felt like how parents would say yay and yipee when their kids are having fun at the playground. OP could try to explain to her that Daddy felt scared when Daddy saw Suzie dressed up all scary so Daddy said some bad words and some people feel bad when Suzie says those words to them. That's what I did with my son and it seemed to work because he stopped saying them.", "NTA. I'm sad you can't find it in yourself to just enjoy laughing at your wife's discomfort because of the situation that is her own damned fault.\n\nAnyway, if you want to get the child to stop swearing, all the adults in her life just need to pretend they can't hear her when she does it. Every kid's different, but I give it a week if you hold firm. Explain the plan to the school. If they want to handle it a different way while she's there, that's on them.", "NTA sometimes saying no doesn't work cuz they get more of a reaction. What I do with my niece (5g) that I'm raising is when the odd swear word is said. I state that it is an adult word. Some words are for kids some are for adults and when she's an adult she can say them.", "NTA look kids learn all sorts of language, your wife played a prank that unfortunately you let out a few choice words over lol who wouldn\u2019t. \nMy daughter will be 5 soon and has heard me swear when a car came towards me on my side of the road she then repeatedly said it, initially I was very much oh don\u2019t say that word then I actually just ignored it and she stopped saying it.\n\nThe teacher has probably heard worse and will in the future.", "Aww man that's a beautiful story, NTA of course.\n\nMy 3 year old spent one glorious weekend saying 'f*** sake'  after he heard one of us swear. I preemptively apologised to his playgroup leader on the Monday, who laughed at us and told us the same thing happened with her kid. The benefit of his pronunciation being a bit dodgy means that it sounded like he was running round telling the other kids 'foosa' so we got away with it. \n\nThe advice we took then was\n1 don't draw attention to it, don't respond by laughing or telling off\n2 calmly say that some people get upset by that word so we don't use it in front of others\n\nGood luck!", "NTA at all.  Also, don't react to the swearing at all.  They'll get over the novelty and quit.", "I would have screamed and probably said much the same as you\u2026.\n\nNTA.\n\nScare pranks do typically have this outcome.", "Meh\n\nJust teach her not to swear at school or in other situations where it's not appropriate.  Trust me, they do get it.  I have a 9 year old.  He's heard it all.  He's never been in trouble for swearing at school.  She'll be fine. People get their panties in a bunch over swearing. As long as you were not swearing AT her, it's fine. NTA", "NTA. It is unfair of your wife to play a cruel prank on you that resulted in you hurting yourself and getting a scare and then when you react like anyone would, she is blaming you for the consequences of her own actions.

Like explaining to her when is swearing apropriate and when not, or maybe consulting a child therapist/specialist about how to stop the child from swearing.", "NTA\n\nWife is now experiencing the consequences of her actions. She didn't stop to think about what naturally happens when scared.\n\nAnd thank god your \"Flight\" instincts kicked in, because imagine if you instinctively tried to punt Chuckie out of reflex?\n\nIf people harass you about it, tell them the truth; mom and kiddo played a prank on you, you got scared and kiddo picked up curses from that. If your wife doesn't like that, she should've thought about that before doing said prank.", "NTA\n\nMake sure you tell the school WHY you were swearing. I mean, if you had laughed in the end it would be funny.\n\nAnd,\nAs a parent,\nSix is old enough for a kid to know that some language is inappropriate for school or people at large, and that even if you hear it it shouldn't be repeated. \nRemember, she doesn't know what the words mean. (Sometimes actually explaining that nips swearing streaks in the bud. Because kids don't actually, for instance, want to say what f*CK means, they just heard the exclamation and know what it's useful for.) She's just excited at the colorful new exclamations. Offer her some ridiculous alternatives.... \"You pajama wearing maniac!\" \"Rotten banana milkshakes!!\" \"Three legged, snot nosed, mangy monkey!\"\n\nGet creative. She'll have better ones than yours, and you'll both wind up laughing \n\nAlso, now is the time to tell her if you don't enjoy jump scare pranks. \ud83d\udc9c", "We told our daughter that they were grown up words and she couldn't use them until she was older and could use them responsibly.", "Thank you, this is the first response I've liked. People clutching their pearls at kids swearing are ridiculous. They're just words. I dunno though my entire family swears freely and always have, even when I was little. We all survived.", "Yep. My 9yo son was going to a Halloween party at his school and I grabbed his mask and hid behind the living room door, husband called the kids down and I scared the living daylights out of them and my almost 12yo jumped halfway across the room and screamed, \"OH SHIT!\" \n\nI laughed my ass off. Once I'd stopped and she was no longer glaring at me (lol) I informed her that I would prefer her to please not use that language in the house but gave her 10/10 for appropriate usage.", "We call them adult words.  And we emphasize that there are other kid appropriate words that work just as well.  We try to have fun coming up with alternatives. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, my son needed stiches. He banged his shin up.  When he was getting the novacaine in his leg, he kept saying \"Frig!\" \"Oh Frig that hurts! I have to say Frig because I shouldn't swear!\" He had us both laughing.", "I would suggest not drawing attention to the behavior, nor teaching her to feel same about words she is going to eventually learn and use as an adult anyway.

Also, I curse in front of my kid all the time.
