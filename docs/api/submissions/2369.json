{"id": 2369, "submission_id": "yvt7zi", "title": "AITA For Swearing At My Child?", "selftext": "Before you jump to conclusions please read the entire article.\n\n\nSo my wife Ashley(35F) and I(36M) have a 6 year old daughter Suzie. Suzie is a very sweet child who rarely gets into trouble. Anyways one day Ashley and Suzie were out having a girl's nights with Ashley's mother and I was out with my brother for some drinks. When I got home that night I noticed that they haven't made it so I decided to take a shower and watch a movie. During that movie I started hearing strange noises. So me being a \"Manly Man\" I went to investigate. I opened the door to our room and looked in the hallway but didn't see anything so I let it go and went back to my movie. A few minutes later I heard it again and went to check again only this time I actually went into the hallway. As I'm walking towards the living room, I hear foot steps behind me and turn around only to see a tiny Chucky doll doll with a knife running towards me. I screamed and swore... \"M*****F****** B****.\" and ran only to trip and bang my knees on the floor. This time I yelled  \"S*** that F******* hurt!!\" Then Ashley comes around the corner laughing and 'chucky' takes the mask off to reveal our daughter also laughing. \n\nSo that was the origin story, the problem now is that Suzie won't stop swearing. We've tried to get her to stop but now we're getting phone calls from her school. One teacher in particular said that Suzie learned those words because \"My daddy screamed them at me.\" (That was a whole entire mess to deal with, I'm sure you can imagine what they thought of us.) My wife is angry with me telling me this is all my fault and that our family is being embarrassed and that she is being called a horrible mother because of it. \n\nAnd before rumors start, no we do not curse around our daughter. She only started swearing after the incident. Also I will take any advice on how to get her to stop.", "created_utc": 1668508019, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvt7zi/aita_for_swearing_at_my_child/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The blame rests fully with your wife. I hope you can resolve all this soon and thanks for posting, it's a very funny story.  Maybe you'll all be laughing about it in a year or so.", "NTA. Your wife played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.", "NTA, if you want to blame someone, your wife started this. Tip: Tell her Santa doesn't leave gifts to children who swear.  \n\n\nEdit: missing word.", "NTA and holy shit I pictured the whole thing and was dying with laughter as my 3 year tries to sleep beside me!!  Im a teacher and mother, it happens.  The teacher should understand and your wife brought this all on, did she expect you to give Chucky a hug?!?  Sooooo NTA and every parent is guilty of dropping a curse word around their child that clings to it like a new sugary candy.", "NTA - next time she is called a bad mother because of your swearing child, she can tell them the story behind it too. It's her fault, not yours.", "NTA. I'm sure that as a parent of a young kid you feel like an arsehole about a lot of things - guilt goes with the territory - but you're clear on this one.", "NTA.\n\nAs for how to nip this problem in the bud, show your daughter a goodie bag, with all kinds of her favorite treats inside of it.  Tell her that every time you, your wife, or her teacher hears a swear word from her, something will come out of the bag.  At the end of the week, what she's left with is what's left in the bag.\n\nYou could also tell her that it's an adult word that you don't want to hear coming out of her mouth. Say it calmly but very seriously.  Give her the \"I mean business\" look as you instruct her.  \n\n\"Some words aren't for children to say.  You are not to repeat them if you hear them. If you really want to say them, do it when you're alone in your bedroom.\"\n\nAlso you could institute time outs, earlier bed times, and a loss of junk food snacks if she continues.   You just have to make it so that she no longer WANTS to say those words.", "So if there is a lot of energy around particular words kids learn to repeat them.   Calmly say \"those words aren't polite, if you want to say them do it in the bathroom\" - or some other private place.  Every kid learns swear words at some point.  They also need to learn when they are not appropriate.   Teach your kids alternative exclamations and enrich their vocabulary with appropriate words by reading to them.   There are many alternative exclamations which are equally funny but not offensive.\n\nYou gave these words huge value by shouting them excitedly and laughing, so it will take some extended effort to extinguish the charge of saying them.      \n\nNAH - its so easy to slip up, they can learn it from one exposure, and it is funny so its hard not to reinforce it with laughing.\n\nPersonally I don't like calling words bad.  They are not polite, but are perfectly good words in the appropriate context.", "NTA  \n\nBut it's hilarious that you legit panicked over that prank.", "NTA. from the outside looking in its funny imagining a 6 yr old getting creative with the cuss words. Sorry you're going through this but as a parent its pretty normal. Kids like to repeat things adults say so just talk to her and tell her those are bad words and she cant say them. Tell her daddy made a no no and is in big trouble so if she doesn't want to get into trouble she should stop.", "NTA.\nIf that was me my instinct would have been to kick....\nSo yeah...\nPlus, kids swear, it happens. My cousin ran around saying F*** repeatedly in a supermarket because he heard someone else in the store say it.\nHe thought it was hilarious when people reacted with shock/horror so he kept doing it until he got bored.\nYour wife started the prank, you just reacted. Not your fault.", "This might be the funniest post I\u2019ve ever read on here! I\u2019m literally dying laughing and my eyes are watering. NTA Oh my god thank you. Also I would have lost my sh*t too, Chucky traumatized me as a child. Tell your wife to chill, she\u2019s the one who let \u201cChucky\u201d come attack you. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "\n if a chucky ever ran at me in a situation like that, i eould literally need a bleep sound effect\ud83d\udc80\n\n nta", "NTA\n\nIf you didn't say it, she would of heard it from someone else and you still would have a problem. \n\nYour wife is embarrassed due to a prank that she pulled gone wrong, that resulted in your daughter picking up some choice words. It happens. \n\nYou have nothing to be worried about and it will be a funny story in years to come", "NTA but your wife is, what would she have done if instead of swearing and running away you yeeted Chucky down the hall?", "Damn this kinda sounds like a bad comedy movie. \n\nNTA\n\nI think you can pretty much bribe her to not swear. Tell her something like, \"if you don't swear for an entire week i will do x/buy you x\".", "NTA.\n\nBeen there done that.  She'll get bored but all the time you react she'll keep doing it. \n\nBut have a chat with her, tell her that what you did was wrong and she shouldn't say those words because they're not kind words to say to people. \n\nI had something very similar when my child was small. Still makes me cringe to this day!", "NTA. If you want to stop her swearing, this might help. I'm a teacher and we get kids who swear at school a lot. We talk about words you can use at home and words you can use at school. At the moment she knows those words are not acceptable and that makes them fun. You can try to minimise the problem by getting her to say them in the house. If you make them bad words kids just want to say them. At 6 she should get this concept.

When little kids cling to words that get a reaction they'll keep using it. You'll need to talk with your daughter about appropriate use of words and 'adult' words like you used and why you used them and why she shouldn't. At 6 that's quite difficult, I had that with my son around age 9/10 so he had more understanding.\n\nYour wife being mad comes across as her frustration that your daughter is using those words at school, which is unfortunately going to be embarrassing for both of you. \n\nIt was a fun prank though, they really got you.", "Nta\n\nThis happens all the time, unfortunately children repeat everything they hear (especially the stuff they shouldn\u2019t). Your wife has no right to blame you, it was an accident and will blow over soon. People should not be calling you bad parents for it.", "This is all your fault?? Excuse me, who put her up to the prank? Oh yes, your wife. She intended to scare you for a funny reaction and she got it, this is entirely her fault. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIf there\u2019s anyone who needs to take any blame here it your wife. She arranged the prank and now these are the consequences.  Your daughter thought the whole thing was funny including the FUNNY words daddy was saying. Sit her down again and explain that children are not allowed to say those words and there will be consequences/punishment. I play practical jokes on my roommate and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that and she got you good!", "NAH. You said some words in a moment of shock and a second moment of pain. Your wife is embarrassed; it\u2019s natural\u2026 many parents would be in the same circumstances. Your daughter is doing normal kid things when they learn new taboo words. There\u2019s no blame to be placed here, just an unfortunate situation to deal with, ideally as a team.\n\nEdit to ask for INFO: Your story isn\u2019t 100% clear; I interpreted it to mean that Suzie was wearing the mask trying to scare you but a quick glance at the other comments (granted there aren\u2019t many at the moment), others seem to have inferred that Ashley was pulling the prank (several \u201cyour wife caused this\u201d comments). Just curious if this was Ashley pranking you to entertain Suzie, or Suzie pranking you and Ashley came around the corner when you yelled.", "NTA lol who doesn\u2019t swear when scared except for nuns?", "Nta. In my house words are like beverages, there are different levels you get access to as you get older. Sit your daughter down and explain that those words are like beer. She can't use them until she old enough to be responsible with them. As for your wife? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\nI try my hardest not to swear, but let\u2019s face it, I swore like a sailor before my kid came in to this world and it\u2019s been hard to not let one slip when I\u2019m super stressed/angry.\n\nThis will be something you can look back on and laugh about, but for now the best advice I can give you is ignore it.  Don\u2019t react. Any reaction, positive or negative, is a reaction and it draws more attention to it. If you ignore it the novelty of it will wear off.\n\nWith your kid being 6, she may understand if you told her \u201cthis is a mommy daddy word, please don\u2019t say it again\u201d.", "NTA, and some advice, when my child swore at that age we'd get down on his level and asked if there was something wrong. Because those were strong words and people only say them when they have big emotions. It cured him of it immediately \ud83d\ude02. We treat it as a strong words, not bad words, and it takes any fun he might have had out of it.", "I can't stop laughing!\ud83d\ude02", "Shit I would've too! Fuck that... a chucky doll with a knife coming at me", "Institute a swear jar for each person, where they have to put something in, a strip of paper or something... the person with the least number of pieces of paper gets a special award each week.
