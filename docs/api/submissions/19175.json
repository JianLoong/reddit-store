There is a reason why newly-sober people are advised not to start new romantic relationships.", "OP having friends who have went through the AA program, part of the recovery is avoiding any type of relationship for a minimum 1 year so seeing that you've been sober for 5 months and with your gf for 3 months it's something you need to revisit.  Second of all being around so much temptation between your gf and family, again doesn't make a lot of sense either.  There's no mention of contacting your sponsor at all in your post, which is has always been explained to me from the people who have been through the program.  Like any situation, sometimes you just need to go back to the basics because no one is going to take care of yourself better than you.", "ESH\n\nYou as a recovering alcoholic can not make that anyone else\u2019s issue. More over whether or not you like to dwell on it, it\u2019s necessary when forming a new relationship to set those boundaries as that may have prevented this entirely by showing you arent compatible. \n\nShe also is the asshole for trying to pressure you into drink. she may not have understood the seriousness of your situation but it was not okay either way.\n\nIn the whole I\u2019d say you need to separate or you WILL relapse", "Not a judgment, but as someone with experience with recovery, dating in the first year of sobriety is generally a no. Your sobriety is your responsibility, and like you\u2019ve said it\u2019s very difficult. Relationships take work and effort, also they cause strong emotional spikes, which can and often does interfere with recovery.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship right now. You currently have no idea how to exist as a sober person around people who can drink without it being an addiction. \n\nShe is also an asshole as she doesn\u2019t understand alcohol addiction any more than you do. However your addiction is yours to manage which is why I\u2019m not going with E S H.", "ESH \nHer suggesting you drink is awful. It shows she isn\u2019t very supportive or uneducated in the matter. Either way super selfish \n\nYou policing her or anyone else is also not okay. It making you want to drink is something you will have to learn to deal with. \n\nBigger thing is that AA and most resources that help with addiction of any kind suggest that recovering addicts do not get into a relationship until after a year of sobriety.", "**ESH** \\- Your addition is your problem.  You are AH for trying to push it on to your gf.  She is an AH for her reaction.", "ESH she is right, that you don't get to tell her what to do, and your own problems don't get to dictate her behavior, as they are your problems and your responsibility, but she sucks for getting wasted in front of an alcoholic.", "And this is why it's recommended that you don't start a new relationship until at least a year of your sobriety has passed.\n\nESH", "ESH, but mostly YTA.\n\nFrom one alcoholic to another, this is your battle to fight, if you can't be around people who drink, it's up to you to get out of that situation, not ask people to stop drinking.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH. \n\nShe obviously should not have pressured you to drink nor should she have called you a \u201cdrunk.\u201d\n\nHowever, you can not make your issues her problem. Especially when she is not the only drinking. You *were* policing her drinking. She had additional wine with the seltzers your family was also having. Respectfully, I think you might need to reevaluate where you are in your sobriety and figure out if you need to be in a relationship and/or be around drinking in social settings. She had wine, and that made you want to drink. It wasn\u2019t even her behavior that triggered you, it was the additional wine. She wasn\u2019t doing shots\u2026", "YTA  \nyou met this girl and got involved 2 months after getting sober.   \nShe is a drinker.   \nYou cannot do both be involved with a drinker and be sober yourself, but you put yourself in a situation where exactly that was going to occur.   \n\n\nFocus on yourself, and if you are in a program , work the steps BEFORE this relationship goes much further.", "YTA you are ok with your family drinking in front of you  because \"they're like 3 seltzers and done type drinkers.\" But  not your girlfriend because \"was chasing her seltzers with wine\" you are either ok with being around alcohol consumption or you're not, you don't get to give other people a cut off because you see it as too much drinking.\n\nBut her comments should make you rethink your relationship for the sake of your recovery because if cold turkey is your only option, her hinting at you to have one drink will not be healthy for you going forward.", "I mean, you shouldn't have yelled at her. It's hard not to seem like an A when yelling but your message was fair and you should leave her. If you want to be sober (and you do) you can't be around her if she's going to be like that.", "Dating her 3 months? Dump her. Also, stay out of places where people will be drinking. Is your family aware of your drinking/sobriety? If so, ask them to support you by not drinking when you are there.", "ESH. You two should not be in a relationship. You\u2019re policing her behavior and she doesn\u2019t seem to care about your sobriety (I am not justifying you telling her she can\u2019t drink - mainly meaning her trying to egg you on into drinking). You are not compatible. \n\nOn a different note and potentially overstepping, I recommend you take some time being sober and single. Maybe not true for everyone, but it helps to really think about what you want and need in a partner as this has likely changed since getting sober even if you haven\u2019t thought deeply about it. You can\u2019t control someone\u2019s drinking or actions, but you can figure out healthy boundaries.", "Dating at the beginning of sobriety is the worst idea", "I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic, and I know how tough it is to be around people who are drinking when you are trying your damndest to not drink. All I can say is to not put yourself in those situations. It will get easier as time passes, and it won\u2019t bother you anymore. I had my last drink on 12/5/1975, and I don\u2019t miss it a bit anymore. As a matter of fact, the smell of alcohol makes me nauseous. Hang in there. You are definitely not the AH.", "This is not a good relationship to be in at this point in your life. Your gf does not understand and does not appreciate your struggle. She should either commit to attending Al-Anon meetings, or you should consider letting her go.", " NTA. I'm sober 270 days, and I know the social and dating changes are especially tough. Someone who really cared about you would want what's best for you, and that is *not* trying \"moderation.\" Someone who loves you will learn more about addiction and support you in your sobriety. My therapist encouraged me to wait a year after I got sober to date. I made some really bad relationship decisions in the first few months I was sober, and I wish I'd listened. Dump her, take care of you, and when everything else starts to line up (it will),!go find love with someone new who has a healthy relationship with alcohol.", "NTA friend. Maybe this early in your recovery, you don't need to be around people who drink like that.", "ESH - you are too early in your sobriety to be dating, and have no right to police other people. Your gf is also an AH for not being more supportive and suggesting a recovering alcoholic can have just one drink.", "NTA. Congrats on your five months! Unfortunately, I think this girlfriend will make it very difficult for you to continue your sobriety. \n\nWhen I got sober, my partner got rid of all the alcohol in the house and did not drink in front of me until I told him I was ok - and that was at least a year. Please consider dating someone who will care about you more than drinking.", "NTA... She is not going to help keep you sober. I am sorry but you need to end it.", "DUMP HER! Seriously. Your sobriety is at risk.", "NTA \n\nBut this relationship may have run it\u2019s course. \n\nDating is not a life sentence: it\u2019s to see if you\u2019re compatible for life.", "All you you do is ask, if she says no; You have to deal with it.", "ESH. The last place you need to be is around anyone who drinks. Especially abusive people who don't care about your problem.", "NTA This is a sign of things to come. You need to surround yourself with people that support you and your sobriety. It's only been three months, and she just showed you a flash of who she is. Believe it now before it gets worse later.", "NTA. I grew up with alcoholics, she should support you while you're wanting to make the effort to better yourself, and she needs to understand that this will likely be ongoing. It seems as though she doesn't fully understand addiction and all that comes with it. Good on you for doing what you need to stay sober.", "YTA.  But damn dude.  You aint perfect.  Shake that shit off.  Pat your sorry ass on the back!!!  Sober 5 months is not a small victory.  It's huge.  And every day after makes it even bigger.  \n\nIt's hard i get it.  And hell, you might even trip.  That does not make you a loser.  Just a man making it work.  \n\nStay the course.  You got this and you're not alone.", "Nta. I\u2019m appalled she suggested you have a drink like it\u2019s not a big deal.", "YTA. Nobody likes a sober drunk. They become the vegans of the drinking world, shaming you because they can't control themselves. Find yourself a GF that doesn't drink.", "NTA.  I\u2019m not an alcoholic, but I don\u2019t like to drink; it makes my depression worse.  One of the only times I\u2019ve yelled at anyone was when they wouldn\u2019t stop pressuring me to drink.  Pressuring you to drink AND calling you a drunk is way over the line.", "If she can\u2019t see what her behavior is doing to you then you are playing with fire. I come from a family of alcoholics and she\u2019s what we call an enabler. You are better off without her and you know it. She will get you into a relapse sooner than you know. Stay strong my friend and keep fighting the good fight.", "Esh here for what she did but there\u2019s a reason AA recommend you don\u2019t start new relationships within the first year of being sober", "ESH. Like others are saying, an addict probably shouldn't start new relationships. Likewise, she could have been more sensitive to it by keeping it lighter around you.", "NTA- you need to have a serious talk with her when she is sober. You cannot be with someone who undermines you and calls you names. She has no respect for your struggles.", "NTA\n\nYou politely asked her not to do something that was triggering your issues that you're recovering from and she flicked shit in your face. I would've yelled too.", "This woman is going to be a real danger to your sobriety. It\u2019s generally a bad idea to make any big life changes or enter new relationships when your sobriety is new and fragile. You\u2019re playing with fire. ESH.", "NTA You weren't harassing or policing her. You were asking for an accommodation for a disability. You had the right to ask. She had the right to refuse. What she didn't have was the right to name-calling.", "And ignore the BS below.  You can be an AH for a day.  So what.", "ESH, but mostly your girl for mocking you for having a disease that causes you to end up in jail, in an institution, or dead. That's a low blow, and fucking foul.\n\nI've been sober for a year and a half. You can't tell other people to not drink around you. It took me more than 6 months to feel kind of okay around others drinking. That meant I had to remove myself from a lot of people and places and surround myself with a support system. It sucks at first, but what matters right now is your sobriety.\nIm assuming from this girls behavior that she hasn't had someone close in her life be an alcoholic or an addict and seems very immature. She doesn't respect you. She told you to have a drink. She mocked you. You need to dump her for your own safety. There is a reason why people with a lot of sober time suggest to those without a lot of time to avoid relationships and work on yourself.", "ESH.  If you are trying to be sober; date someone who is sober.\n\nYou can't force your girlfriend to be sober and alcohol is a sensitive issue for you.", "Listen, you shouldn't be in a relationship at all, and doubly not with someone who doesn't know how to handle their drinking. I'd highly recommend ending the relationship and reevaluating your life. Take some time to find sober you and stay away from people who drink. \n\nI'm also going to say NTA. Your partner should respect you enough to stop drinking when you ask. That doesn't give you a free pass to be in a relationship at this point though. Figure yourself out before you get into another serious relationship", "Nta. It was a reasonable request to which she replied with callousness.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also this is why they tell you not to date anyone for a year as you're getting sober. You need to focus on your sobriety and that's it. This isn't a time for a relationship or starting a relationship, especially with someone who enjoys drinking.", "ESH - No you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her. But she should also have respect for your sobriety, as should your family. My husband was an angry and abusive alcoholic who drank 15+ beers a day for almost 15 years. I was and still am so proud of his 10 years of sobriety, so out of solidarity and respect, I also quit drinking. His family (who also are severe alcoholics) aren\u2019t proud of his choice, and at every opportunity they try to sabotage him. \n\nYour sobriety is your journey alone, but you can choose to surround yourself with people who will respect and support your choice to be sober.", "NTA You are a recovering Alcoholic and she knew that. You did the right thing by expressing your discomfort with the way she was drinking. You asked her not to do it around you, you didn't ask her to stop all together. Any good partner wouldn't have been drinking around you period let alone get angry becuase you told them how you were feeling. Yes she was intoxicated but her reaction was inappropriate. You deserve to feel safe around the people you love. \n\nI am a recovering anorexic and bulimic, it is my responsibility to be aware of my triggers and inform the people around me what they are. No one would blame me if I asked them not to talk about calories when I'm around. They would understand that this is a trigger for me and would care about how it would effect me. I'm not asking people not to diet or count calories all the time; I'm asking them to just not do it near me. \n\nI would take time to write down your triggers then make a safety plan. For example you now know being around people drinking heavily will make you want to do so as well. Therefore avoid situations where this might play out. Don't hang out with your partner when she is drinking. Try to use \"I feel\" statements when explaining your emotions to others and remind her that you're not asking her to stop drinking all together,you're just asking her not to do it around you. Reassure her youre not angry with her you just now know what you need in order to get better. People tend to get standoffish when they think they are in trouble so try remind her that you're having a conversation not an argument. \n\nI wish you luck and I am very proud of you for getting sober!", "While I was reading this post, I was shaking my head.
