It's hard not to seem like an A when yelling but your message was fair and you should leave her. If you want to be sober (and you do) you can't be around her if she's going to be like that.", "Dating her 3 months? Dump her. Also, stay out of places where people will be drinking.

My therapist encouraged me to wait a year after I got sober to date. I made some really bad relationship decisions in the first few months I was sober, and I wish I'd listened.

Maybe this early in your recovery, you don't need to be around people who drink like that.", "ESH - you are too early in your sobriety to be dating, and have no right to police other people. Your gf is also an AH for not being more supportive and suggesting a recovering alcoholic can have just one drink.", "NTA. Congrats on your five months! Unfortunately, I think this girlfriend will make it very difficult for you to continue your sobriety. \n\nWhen I got sober, my partner got rid of all the alcohol in the house and did not drink in front of me until I told him I was ok - and that was at least a year.

The last place you need to be is around anyone who drinks. Especially abusive people who don't care about your problem.", "NTA This is a sign of things to come. You need to surround yourself with people that support you and your sobriety. It's only been three months, and she just showed you a flash of who she is. Believe it now before it gets worse later.", "NTA. I grew up with alcoholics, she should support you while you're wanting to make the effort to better yourself, and she needs to understand that this will likely be ongoing. It seems as though she doesn't fully understand addiction and all that comes with it. Good on you for doing what you need to stay sober.", "YTA.  But damn dude.  You aint perfect.  Shake that shit off.  Pat your sorry ass on the back!!!  Sober 5 months is not a small victory.  It's huge.  And every day after makes it even bigger.  \n\nIt's hard i get it.  And hell, you might even trip.  That does not make you a loser.  Just a man making it work.  \n\nStay the course.  You got this and you're not alone.", "Nta. I\u2019m appalled she suggested you have a drink like it\u2019s not a big deal.", "YTA. Nobody likes a sober drunk.

I\u2019m not an alcoholic, but I don\u2019t like to drink; it makes my depression worse.  One of the only times I\u2019ve yelled at anyone was when they wouldn\u2019t stop pressuring me to drink.  Pressuring you to drink AND calling you a drunk is way over the line.", "If she can\u2019t see what her behavior is doing to you then you are playing with fire.

She has no respect for your struggles.", "NTA\n\nYou politely asked her not to do something that was triggering your issues that you're recovering from and she flicked shit in your face. I would've yelled too.", "This woman is going to be a real danger to your sobriety. It\u2019s generally a bad idea to make any big life changes or enter new relationships when your sobriety is new and fragile. You\u2019re playing with fire. ESH.", "NTA You weren't harassing or policing her. You were asking for an accommodation for a disability. You had the right to ask. She had the right to refuse.

So what.", "ESH, but mostly your girl for mocking you for having a disease that causes you to end up in jail, in an institution, or dead. That's a low blow, and fucking foul.\n\nI've been sober for a year and a half. You can't tell other people to not drink around you. It took me more than 6 months to feel kind of okay around others drinking. That meant I had to remove myself from a lot of people and places and surround myself with a support system. It sucks at first, but what matters right now is your sobriety.\nIm assuming from this girls behavior that she hasn't had someone close in her life be an alcoholic or an addict and seems very immature. She doesn't respect you. She told you to have a drink. She mocked you. You need to dump her for your own safety. There is a reason why people with a lot of sober time suggest to those without a lot of time to avoid relationships and work on yourself.", "ESH.  If you are trying to be sober; date someone who is sober.\n\nYou can't force your girlfriend to be sober and alcohol is a sensitive issue for you.", "Listen, you shouldn't be in a relationship at all, and doubly not with someone who doesn't know how to handle their drinking. I'd highly recommend ending the relationship and reevaluating your life. Take some time to find sober you and stay away from people who drink. \n\nI'm also going to say NTA. Your partner should respect you enough to stop drinking when you ask. That doesn't give you a free pass to be in a relationship at this point though.

You did the right thing by expressing your discomfort with the way she was drinking. You asked her not to do it around you, you didn't ask her to stop all together. Any good partner wouldn't have been drinking around you period let alone get angry becuase you told them how you were feeling. Yes she was intoxicated but her reaction was inappropriate. You deserve to feel safe around the people you love. \n\nI am a recovering anorexic and bulimic, it is my responsibility to be aware of my triggers and inform the people around me what they are.

I'm not asking people not to diet or count calories all the time; I'm asking them to just not do it near me. \n\nI would take time to write down your triggers then make a safety plan. For example you now know being around people drinking heavily will make you want to do so as well. Therefore avoid situations where this might play out. Don't hang out with your partner when she is drinking. Try to use \"I feel\" statements when explaining your emotions to others and remind her that you're not asking her to stop drinking all together,you're just asking her not to do it around you.
