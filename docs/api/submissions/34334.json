I probably have more patience with it than most, but man it's draining. There are a lot of people out there who are lonely, isolated, and struggling -and on top of that they have zero social awareness. Like none. Gentle brush offs don't work. You have to be direct. There are ways to do that with kindness, but regardless it's going to feel mean. It's not. They won't catch hints - you have to be clear and direct to say \"Please give me some space and let me complete my transaction. I'm sorry you're going through a lot but I don't know you and just want to go.\" \n\nIt's sad and heartbreaking that there are so many out there who are so lonely that they are just reaching out wildly at random for any human connection.

Obviously the cancer diagnosis is tough, but the fact that she felt the need to vent to absolute random strangers including one that wasn't even assisting her with her purchase (you) may indicate she doesn't really have anyone she can vent to or support her. I worked in customer service before and found there are plenty of lonely people out there that just don't have someone to talk to and it comes out in their interactions like this. \n\nBut I mean, yeah, it's not your responsibility to comfort her and it stands reason to set a boundary.

Its always ok in these peoples eyes for someone else to inconvenience you  but the second you say anything or ask not to be involved you are the AH.

I agree with that part.\n\n>you need to back up and give me some space. Stop interrupting our conversation\n\nShe was invading his personal space and interrupting. Not remotely rude, no way to do this nicer.\n\n>again, sorry to hear that but we are not your therapists, back up\n\nSorry to hear that sounds pretty nice. And they're not her therapists, nothing mean there. I just don't see where OP could've been \"nicer\".", "So, you have no answer. Thanks for conceding your point, even if it was in a roundabout way.", "And perhaps OP\u2019s wife is projecting and doesn\u2019t want anyone to silence her. That\u2019s a her problem. OP was reasonable.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know if this is commonplace, but when my husband was diagnosed, he was given access to special counselors within the cancer department. The woman should be talking to them, not some poor cashier whose options are smile or get fired.", "True, that was a kindness. The converse of that was exploding a new waterbed back in the mid-90s while filling it because he on the phone in another room instead of watching it since this was pre-cordless phones. That was some fun cleaning up with the shop vac, let me tell you.", "Yes, Gary lives on a farm now with all the room he needs to run around and chase squirrels", "I\u2019m 100% the type of person who\u2019d lie in that situation to avoid it being awkward, but i was also the type of retail worker who\u2019d only ask about an occasion if it was obviously a good one (buying sequin party dresses, table decorations, \u201cbride to be\u201d accessories, etc)", "> What the rude people don\u2019t realize is that the polite people are the first I give free shit to or forget to ring in a pint for.\n\nYeah, almost by definition, the only people getting free beer are the ones who'll find it to be a pleasant surprise", "Wow. That is a horrible thing to say.", "r/traumatizethemback", "I see, yeah that would be understandable.", "The lady was talking in her ear, I interpret that as \"way to close to my personal space bubble\"", "I'm not.arguing.about it, no headspace for it. We can have different opinions can't we? Not everyone e is going to think the same, and neither I or you are.going to change our mind, nor should we.", "People like that know they\u2019re \u201cholding someone hostage,\u201d that\u2019s why they pick employees instead of some random person walking by. I\u2019d bet as soon as you left she started right back up again (hopefully you emboldened those around you). I used to absolutely abhor customers who did that to me.", "He went to Gary heaven, where all Uncle Garys go.", "Haha I see what you mean! I think I just wasn\u2019t mentally prepared for that question. He was really sweet though and said something like \u201cwell, they are a really special person then.\u201d Real sweet guy.", "Really? I thought it was pretty spot on", "I totally agree, my point was just agreeing with the previous commenter that this wasn't a selfless act by OP on the cashier's behalf. OP was clearly mostly speaking out of their own annoyance.", "So you don\u2019t have the headspace for this conversation, but OP is the asshole for having neither the headspace nor the actually physical space because of this rude person, and OPs the asshole? Makes total sense.", ">nor should we\n\nAh, the response of the thick-headed man. So it's not that you don't have the \"headspace\" for it, but that you literally cannot hold trains of thought in your head long enough to reasonably defend your position. Thanks for letting me know.", "She tried it with OP, too, though.  She might have just been venting to anyone in a 3 foot radius, and OP just happened to run into her at a retail store instead of an elevator or the bus.", "Lol. If that was to trigger a defensive response, you'll have to try harder. And welcome to reddit btw.", "[removed]", "\ud83d\ude18", "Just absolutely pathetic."]}
