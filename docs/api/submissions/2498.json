She says she's allergic, but when you ask clarifying questions like, \"Oh, have you been tested?\" she'll say that she's not actually allergic, it just gives her a headache sometimes.\n\nWhen I found this out, I was kind of sad, because I love perfume and scented lotion and all kinds of stuff like that. But, to be considerate, I never spray perfume or put on lotion when she's in the room.\n\nThe other day, I took a shower in the communal bathroom on our floor. I put a scented lotion on in the bathroom when I was done. It was not a heavy scent. I came back into the room, and she made a big deal of gagging and leaving the room.\n\nA few minutes later, she came back into the room and told me that I can never do that again. I replied back that I have already compromised by never spraying perfume or putting on lotion when she's in the room, and that is enough. She threw a little hissy fit, and she brings it up to our friends (who are all on my side, they smelled the lotion, it really isn't strong) whenever she can.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for refusing to stop?\n\nEdit for more info:\nI also have fragrance sensitivities to heavy fragrances, so I do not own any. Unlike her, I am actually diagnosed. Some of my friends who smelled it also have fragrance sensitivities. Roommate has several friends who smoke cigarettes, I have an allergy to cigarette smoke, I deal with the headaches when she comes back smelling like smoke because it's her space, too, she can't cater to my every desire. I think she should do the same thing on the rare occasion that I have to take a shower when she's in the room.\n\nEdit two:\nI am accepting my place as the asshole.

She may even be experiencing heightened sensation/ sensitivity because once it\u2019s triggered, some individuals experience odors as part of or in lieu of (visual) aura. It\u2019s not always easy to diagnose and even when you have great coverage and access to medical care it\u2019s often dismissed or pushed aside especially when people don\u2019t have the vocabulary or full understanding of their symptoms and what\u2019s happening like it sounds like your roommate does.\n\nBoth my mother and grandmother have suffered from migraines since childhood as is true for me. Our migraines are actually remarkably similar in how we experience them during an attack and we all tend to react similarly (for the most part) to medications and treatment options when in the middle of an attack. Our migraines are all remarkably similar. But one major difference? There are smells and scents that actually tend to help lessen symptoms at the start or end of mine or at least make me more comfortable while I suffer. Those same things can actually start triggering symptoms in my mother. Things that have no impact on her whatsoever bother me a ton. \n\nNEITHER OF YOU should have to put up with headaches because of the other person\u2019s disregard for the other human they\u2019re forced to share space with. You absolutely should stop using scented lotions that bother her. Full stop.

That\u2019s not ok and I fully understand why you might be feeling less than charitable towards her right now but just as you\u2019re bothered by the smoke smell she\u2019s experiencing the same from your lotion. The answer isn\u2019t both of you put up with physical pain - it\u2019s both of you stop being unwilling to consider the other person. \n\nBut on the cig smoke, try some of the following methods (also get headaches from it and have lived with folks that didn\u2019t always care ):\nWhite vinegar. Bowls of it around the space help. Laundress makes one that\u2019s specifically designed to neutralize odors. Washing the walls with it and/ or using it with laundry can also help. That\u2019s also a strong smell though so if not feasible try baking soda. Bowls of it around the room and sprinkle it on items that reek leave overnight and vacuum in the am. A bowl of activated charcoal (don\u2019t rub on to surfaces just let it absorb odor in the room) also can help. \n\nAlso if you don\u2019t have a good air purifier / cleaner - get one. It is a really good investment and will improve your quality of life if you\u2019re dealing with smoke odor induced asthma or migraines. Seriously. Just don\u2019t get an ozone generating one.", "Okay so you know how to deal with it, so she will have to deal with it within a dorm situation?
