This weekend he was DJ\u2019ing the club on Friday night, and doing a private event Saturday mid-noon. He asked to borrow my car for the Friday night and I allowed him to. He was in a hurry the next morning to leave for his next gig, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to speak to him. That morning when I checked, my car was still in the driveway and he\u2019d taken his car. I had made plans that morning to spend time with friends, so I took a shower and got ready. A few hours later , I stepped outside and my car was gone. At first I panicked because I thought my car was stolen, but after a few phone calls and speaking with his assistant , I found out my fianc\u00e9 came back to the house and took my car.

I can understand and empathize with your frustration and upset. It's completely justified given what happened. Your fianc\u00e9 took your car without asking or even informing you, leaving you stranded and unable to keep your plans with friends. That is certainly not fair or considerate. You mentioned that you were understanding and supportive of his need to use your car for his DJ equipment, which shows your kindness and willingness to accommodate his needs. However, your generosity doesn't excuse his lack of communication and consideration for your needs. It's crucial to have open and clear communication in a relationship, particularly when it comes to sharing resources such as a car.\n\nEven if he had a valid reason for needing your car again, he should have reached out to you to discuss the situation and find a solution together. Taking both cars without a clear explanation only added to your confusion and frustration. It's understandable why you would feel this way. His response, shifting the blame onto you for not communicating your need for the car, is unfair. As the owner of the car, you shouldn't be expected to explicitly ask for permission to use your *own* vehicle. It's common courtesy for him to inform you beforehand or at the very least, communicate his plans with you.\n\nIn conclusion, you are definitely not the asshole here. Your fianc\u00e9 should have respected your boundaries, communicated his intentions, and found a better way to handle the situation.", "NTA - and the fact that he won\u2019t explain why he had both vehicles (and how is that even possible) is suspicious.", "NTA \n\nIt is so clear.
