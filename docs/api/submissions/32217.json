Where anything could have happened, and it did. This is your fault period just so we're clear. It was a stupid decision. That's what they're getting at. You're the person who bought a white hoodie for $600 when there are perfectly good hoodies for $100.", "No, your insurance company would laugh if you tried to make a claim for that. If you insisted and made the claim your deductible is probably that amount and your premiums would increase and your insurance company would not renew your policy because it was a frivolous claim.", "i'm your height and 85 lbs... and i have reynaud's. i have made it 34 years without having to spend $600 on a hoodie lol.", "I'm 5'2 and I'm 125/130 and I'm always cold and I just layer up.", "Do you think you\u2019re the only small person to live in a cold place or something? There\u2019s far more economical ways to stay warm than buying a $600 hoodie, and I\u2019m saying that as a person who lived in Wisconsin and endured 30 below zero temperatures.", "womp womp", "that\u2019s average weight for your height\n\nshe can buy you a new hoodie but you expecting her to drop 600 on the exact same hoodie is insane especially when you haven\u2019t tried all the options", "Then get a $40 fleece jacket.", "How is that not a gift?", "If you bought it using your parents money, it wasn't a gift. It was you spending mommy and daddy's money.", "If you don't try to have a professional clean it first, YTA. Stuff does happen, especially at social get togethers. If you're going to wear a $600 hoodie (especially white), obviously your risks bare higher. If a pro can't get it out then n t a for trying your best first. Trying some deft at home is not the equivalent of trying your best...", "Have you tried the cleaners? She should pay to get it cleaned and if that doesn\u2019t work, pay to replace what she ruined.", "My husband grew up with actual money. His parents are multimillionaires and have been since the 80s. \n\nThere are 2 things people with money actually know, which makes me know you don't have money:\n1. They know most other people don't have money like they do.\n2. They respond accordingly to this info. They either know that other people cannot afford the car, clothing, electronics, etc that they can. Then they decide if it's worth the risk to those things by being around people who don't have those luxuries.\n\nAlso, a real wealthy person has hoodies in the thousands. Not a $600 hoodie that they have one of and bought in white. Lol", "And we\u2019ve seen you throw a tantrum over an overpriced jacket.  Good luck.", "In Europe they really have low cost, low value liability insurance for \"kids damaging neighbor's fence\" or \"spilling shit on designer jacket\" or \"you drop your friend's camera\" etc.", "I also have Raynaud's and throwing on tight fitted compression gear or a bodysuit and layering up has been more effective than any hoodie, even the high quality ones rated for cold temperatures. Sustaining cold temps is all about the layers.", "True, but wearing one extremely warm layer is easier and I can afford it", "Raynauds person here, too! Tight socks and gloves are my best friends. There are a lot of products out there that will keep you warm without costing you $600", "But yet you can\u2019t afford to take something go a professional cleaner? Do you really thing every person out there can afford a 600 dollar jacket? \n\nYou\u2019ve got major first world problems. If you need a 600 dollar hoodie to be in a house that\u2019s what normal home temperatures, you need to sort out your priorities.", "Great, get a new hoodie then.", "Cool. Buy yourself a new hoodie then. And consider not getting white next time.", "I think you mean your parents can", "All the other colors were also pale, so it would\u2019ve been the same outcome just a different shade", "You're telling me in their entire catalog they only had pale colors? Not even black? I'm not buying it.\n\nhttps://www.canadagoose.com/us/en/shop/apparel/?page=3&start=60&sz=20. I just went to their website and I see a lot of different sweatshirts in the color black. They even have the same sweatshirts separated where some are considered a different product and in Darker colors. It's still the exact same sweater, just different", "The one I got didn\u2019t have darker colors as an option I meant"]}
