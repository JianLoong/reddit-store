This is the first time I've met her dad. The only thing I know about him is that he was a prospect for a shady local motorcycle gang, with a racist past. This friendsgiving was a potluck.

So I'm at the friendsgiving and my son (10yrs) hasn't eaten his, because he doesn't like onions, and Sarah's dad starts to say that he understands why my son hasn't eaten his, because it wasn't very good. I ignore this, but he drags it on, even when others say they thought it was good.

I see Sarah a couple weeks later and I've had a few beers, so I decide this is the time to tell her that her dad was a dick to me, so if he's going to be at an event, don't invite us. She tries to defend him saying that this is just the way he is. I let her know that in my past relationship, I was constantly picked at by my ex's family for little things like this, and it triggered me. My fiance interjects and brings up his past motorcycle gang history, and she tries to defend this too. At this point, she exists the conversation and walks off crying. I find her a few min later and let her know that this is nothing against her, but we were just dreading having to be at future events with this guy, who just seems to like insulting people.  She says she doesn't want to talk about it anymore, and we drop it.

It probably did not know this conversation was coming, but that doesn't mean we don't have difficult conversations.  They still need to be had.\n\nNext time you are alone with her, or just not with your partner there, I would probably apologize for if it felt like an attack.  Remind her that it is not against her at all, and that you did not mean for it come like an attack or to make her cry.  That might help to mend fences between you two a bit.  And I am saying do it without your husband so that she does not feel like she has to accept the apology because it is two of you again.", "NTA   Weird that this guy - a grown adult - decided out of nowhere to pick on you, and your potato salad. You're not being an ass for not wanting to be around him. If Sarah wants to defend him and his rather mean ways, that's on her.

Then when she walks off because she's had enough you follow her to continue justifying yourself? That was not okay.\n\nDid you stop and consider if it was worth it for the day to day awkwardness you would cause for your husband and hers? You'll learn there is a certain amount of biting your tongue that's necessary when it comes to seeing your husband's work contacts, because you're there to support him, not cause issues for him. Same as if he turned up to one of your work events or drinks. Would you want him to cause issues with any of your coworkers?", "But why did he drag it though? Telling her it was nasty only needed to be done once. Anything after that is to illicit a reaction. He's literally too old to be acting like that.\n\nYou're calling them the bully?! That's funny.

I'm so sick of that \"that's just the way he/she/they are/is\" as a line of defence or justification.  It's  NOT.  It's unacceptable behaviour that needs to be called out instead of passed over and enabled.  I'm glad you both spoke up, even if it didn't change his assholishness."]}
