It must have been 3 months at least because I know that in the end of July it was already broken for a while. \n\nTomorrow he\u2019ll come over and he asked me if he could wash a few loads of his laundry here, at my parents house (where I lie \u2014 I am in my last months of my bachelors degree and have been living at home the last two years because I get along well with my parents and financially it\u2019s easier for me this way while I\u2019m still studying because I am not paying rent here)\n\nIf his machine broke recently I would\u2019ve even offered myself to wash his laundry for him as I would for any friend of mine. But he had months to fix this/ take care of this and he didn\u2019t. \n\nThe reason he didn\u2019t have savings to get it fixed or buy a new one right when it broke is that he went gambling in the summer. Now that he has saved up enough for it, it took him weeks to make an appointment to check if it can be repaired. For another few weeks now he has known it cannot be repaired but he didn\u2019t properly look for a new one because he has to coordinate that with his roommate and she rarely is home. I mean he could just call her or set up a time if it was important? \n\nI don\u2019t want him to wash his laundry here because then we can\u2019t really go out tomorrow.  Also he wants to take it home wet so he can hang it there? I just want a chill day with him and not worry about some laundry or him leaving early to go hang his laundry. He can wash it in the wash saloon right in his street that seems a lot easier to me. \n\nHe didn\u2019t accuse me of being an asshole for saying I don\u2019t want him to wash his laundry here. But he said he thinks my reasons are weird. I feel a little bit bad and wonder if I should\u2019ve just said yes even though I don\u2019t like the thought of him bringing his laundry tomorrow? \n\nSo AITA for telling my bf I don\u2019t want him to wash his laundry here?\n\nEdit: \n\n1) He has other options to wash his laundry! \nYes there is a washing saloon like next to his street so it\u2019s not far and it\u2019s not expensive. Also he has washed his clothes at a friends house that lives close to him (I live 30min away). Also there is a washing machine within his house (just has to walk a few stairs) that runs with coins that cost less than 2\u20ac but you need to buy them once a week and you need change for that but that\u2019s definitely doable in my opinion. \n\n2) About the whole situation: I have talked to him about the fact that I am unhappy with the way he doesn\u2019t take care of things especially when he says he \u201ewants to apply for other jobs soon\u201c, or \u201eenroll for his license soon\u201c, but then doesn\u2019t do it. He said he understands. I know he is unhappy with it too. He said he wants to change now and we\u2019ve had a difficult 2 years together and I understand that it\u2019s sometimes hard to do things you set out to do. He\u2019s been in therapy a while now. I love him a lot and I really hope things are going to change but if not he knows I don\u2019t see a future for us.", "created_utc": 1667260250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yisvfy/aita_for_not_letting_my_boyfriend_wash_his/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's obviously a lot more going on than just a simple \"get washing machine repaired\". He needed to get it looked at, needed to see if there was a way to repair it, see how much it costs to get a new one, and pick out a new one with his roommate.", "NTA\n\nLaundromat's are amazing, quick and not very expensive.", "So you want to chill with your bf in his stinky, unwashed clothes? Sounds like he wants to wash at your place so he can take care of his laundry while spending time with you. It also sounds like he is a bit of a slacker and gambler and that's what is really irritating you. Hoping that he is going to change his personality is probably an exercise in frustration.\n\nYTA for deluding yourself that denying him access to your washing machine is going to spur him to change his ways. You said that you've been with him 2 years. This is who he is.", "NTA.  This is not just about laundry.  This is about your BF being unable to take full responsibility for his life circumstances.  You are thinking like an adult and he is stuck in an adolescent rut.  You want him to change, and you don\u2019t fully trust him - two strong indications that this relationship is not working.", "It doesn't really sound like you love him a lot. YTA", "Yeah the gambling is a whole different topic but we\u2019ve talked about that", "Yes, he\u2019s even been there I mean he\u2019s managed to clean his laundry the last 3 months and he\u2019s been going there a few times and also to a friend of his.", "I told him I would if he keeps not following up on the things he always said (since we met) he would do and change. I am starting to not believe it anymore. He seemed determined and motivated when I first got to know him and he had just got his first job even though it was just part time supermarket.. and wanted to start therapy. He did that but the rest he didn\u2019t do", "Yes I would do the same!", "This is correct \n\nOn top of this, then in that moment, it doesn't mater what happened 6 months eariler, he needed help from you and you turned him down only for punitive reasons.\n\nYes he should have fixed his problems but that doesn't mean you should add to them.", "I did have a conversation with him about the whole no money, gambling, not taking care of his things situation. A few weeks ago actually. I\u2019ve told him I am unhappy with him announcing things he then doesn\u2019t do (he said he would enroll to get his license soon or start looking for a better job \u2014 or a new washing machine \u2014 many many times, but then doesn\u2019t do it or only starts but then let\u2019s it go again)\n\nHe knows I see no future for us if these things don\u2019t change and he said he understands my worries and that he really wants to change anyways and feels he is ready to do these things now. \n\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not that I want to punish him. I just don\u2019t want to be affected by his laundry problem. We had a nice day planned together. He literally could even wash it in his own house complex he only needs to organize some change to buy the laundry coins.", "He said he would do 2 loads of laundry so to be fair it wouldn\u2019t be all day, but it would still affect the time we are able to spend and what we can do. Also he\u2019s probably going to want to leave early because he wants to hang it at his place.\n\nAnd yeah it\u2019s not even my washing machine. I am only getting to use it. That\u2019s also why I don\u2019t want him doing it here because I have noticed that sometimes he handles things in a careless manner so I\u2019m actually afraid he\u2019ll break something when he uses the machine and I know my mum is always really careful with it.", "Ammmm what did I just read?

It\u2019s not like he will do that all day. Do it in the morning and go out. Here, problem solved.\n\nEdit: i see. Weeks of laundry and you want to spend time with him at home. It takes 2 min to take the laundry out of the machine and lit new in. It will take all day don\u2019t worry. Weeks of laundry will keep him there for longer than he intended", "We don\u2019t have to hangout if he says he wants to do his laundry tomorrow instead that\u2019s fine. But I don\u2019t see why he needs to do it here when he has other options. He\u2019s washed it other places the last few weeks so it\u2019s not like he will have to walk around in dirty clothes", "That\u2019s all okay, he can do it in his time. And he can wash his laundry at the washing saloon next to his street\u2026 don\u2019t see why he needs to wash it here", "OP, don\u2019t stay for the potential \u201cfuture\u201d person he could be \u201cif he changes\u201d.

There are so many stories of people who stick around for \u201cchange\u201d and then they\u2019re super resentful and miserable because it doesn\u2019t happen.", "I washed his laundry for him in the beginning when the machine broke. I washed it for him. \n\nAlso I wash the clothes he wears when he comes to visit me. I always offer him to leave his dirty clothes he has worn here and wash them for him. So I almost always have clean clothes when he comes here that he can change into.\n\nI don\u2019t want to punish him. I know he\u2019s already feeling bad for not taking care of his washing machine situation. I also told him I would help him look for one if he wants to.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want that to affect the time we planned to spend together. Using the washing machine in his house complex costs not even 2\u20ac he just needs to get the coins for it next door. Then there\u2019s also a washing saloon in his street, similar price.", "So it\u2019s not really about the laundry necessarily but about the fact you feel like he\u2019s immature? That he\u2019s not taking initiative with things in his life? Maybe you feel like he\u2019s lazy in a way?", "Perfectly good reasons to say No.  Especially that it's not your machine.  \n\nWhile most 'college kids' bring their laundry to their parents home, and those parents expect it - it's not a good look for the BF/GF to drop by with THEIR laundry.  \n\nIt's your parents machines and their call, and honestly it wouldn't make your bf look great to them that he's not fixed/replaced his in so many months.", "You\u2019re probably right. We have a therapy session next week. Had a promise we would go to therapy at least one time before one of us breaks up. I know I need to leave soon though because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to change. He just can\u2019t and it\u2019s not fair to be mad about that I\u2019ve witnessed it long enough to know I cannot believe him when he says he will change.", "It does sound like you did everything right leading up to this. It is also understandable that you would be upset when you thought you had a date and he wants to do laundry. I actually missed that the date is tomorrow and you haven't turn him down on the spot.\n\nYou have changed my mind about you also being the asshole. I dont think you are for telling him in advance but you need to think about letting him go if you are over it.\n\nIf you want a relationship you should still help him. If he doesn't have 2 euro for the laundromat, he doesn't have the money for a new washer. I doubt he WANTS to be in a situation where to takes his cloths to his gfs parents house and it's likely a last resort.", "I guess it\u2019s all one big issue", "Thanks for reconsidering. Yes I\u2019ve been thinking too if that is the reason. I don\u2019t want to believe it because that would mean he has lied to me. But it would explain his behaviour. Also last week when we went to pick up some food for dinner together he asked if I would pay his food because he said I still owed him 8\u20ac from some time ago which was true. I paid his food but it was like 13\u20ac or something I think but I didn\u2019t look on the receipt I thought that\u2019s weird for a few euros to now check what his food cost. But maybe he had no money then. I don\u2019t know. \n\nHe\u2019s been hiding things from me before. He stole at the supermarket he worked in. I asked him because I had a feeling and he admitted. He tells me when he quits smoking but never when he starts smoking again (I smell it and ask). I feel like if I didn\u2019t ask he wouldn\u2019t tell me. \n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019s just been lying. My trust is definitely scratched.", "I understand. I\u2019m going to say that NAH simply because I understand why you would be frustrated but also we don\u2019t know his situation fully. He could be depressed which is a whole different situation on it\u2019s own. But no you\u2019re not an A-hole for not letting him do the laundry. Not when theres other ways of getting it done.", "Does he actually work at the supermarket or has he been fired? If he works there and steals, honestly he really isn't a good person I'm sorry to say. It also means he likely gambling all his money then stealing to live (specualtion obviously). If he had no money and stole something because he needed it I have some sympathy. It's hard and embarrassing being completely broke. Either way he is still lying to you about smoking.\n\nBest of luck with the situation", "The stealing was some time ago. He never got caught though. He quit that job a few months ago himself to work in a different supermarket, I know that is true because I know others that worked there (used to work there myself as a mini jobber) no one knows he stole anything there. I don\u2019t think he stole anything again after that but of course I cannot know. I honestly don\u2019t know if he\u2019s lying right now. He might say the truth. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know I think maybe this trust can\u2019t be repaired. I have been so close to breaking up with him many times the past weeks. I hope the therapy session next week will maybe give some hope. But I don\u2019t know maybe we need to talk tomorrow. I have a bad feeling", "Stealing is almost never a one off thing unless he was out of money. And even if he was, it sounds like he's still out of money and is still likely stealing. Also you say he didn't get caught like a makes it OK. If you want to be with the Petty thief then you can go ahead.\n\nI have also been in a relationship where my trust was broken, and I was about to break up with her at any moment for years. We stayed in a relationship for another 3 years and she did never broke my trust again but my trust was never repaired so we broke up anyway.", "If a friend told you that she was in a relationship with someone like your boyfriend -- gambling addiction, financial problems, lying, stealing, inability to manage ordinary responsibilities -- would you say \"wow  you're lucky, he sounds great\"?\n\nHe's shown you who he is. Making promises about changing himself and getting his act together are empty words. You can't fix him, and it's not your responsibility to do so. You deserve a relationship with an actual adult who has something to offer, not someone who's skidding from one crisis to another  mooching off you, and making empty promises.", "I do. He is an amazing partner in many many ways. Very loving, patient, funny, caring. And I would love to have a family with him, I would love if we could stay together and get married and all. But the others are right that this laundry thing is just an example of the bigger problem I have with the way he handles things and that is making me worry if I really want to stay with him", "I\u2019d probably tell her to leave. I don\u2019t think about all these things usually when we spend time\u2026 he can be so nice and loving and I guess I am just ignoring the other things too much. \n\nHe said if he won\u2019t manage to change in the next 3 months we should break up. Because he knows I am unhappy and also because he wants to change and if he hasn\u2019t managed to do so while being with me (last 2 years) he is maybe unable to be in a relationship and also working on himself while he is. I think I am ready to leave if the counseling doesn\u2019t help. Also I need to hand in an essay and I\u2019ve been procrastinating that. Somehow I feel like I can\u2019t tell him to do these things when I myself am procrastinating something. And maybe I will have a more clear head when I have my own things resolved. But it\u2019s my last exam so after that I will be applying for jobs etc, then starting my first full time job. Somehow I\u2019m thinking it might make him want to change too when he sees me doing these things.", "I don\u2019t think the stealing is too bad honestly. When I was 16 I was stealing a lot of clothes back then. I wouldn\u2019t do it now of course, and I think it\u2019s kind of stupid to risk getting caught for something like that and also it\u2019s just not honest and not okay but what I dislike most is that he didn\u2019t tell me. I always tell him about my life, the good and the bad things. I tell him when I did things that I dislike about myself (for example when I procrastinate studying for Uni etc). I feel like he is trying to hide half of his personality from me. He says he did it (the stealing) because he was unhappy with the company and wanted to \u201edamage\u201c them by stealing, he also always used lots of plastic gloves just to damage them which makes no sense but people do stupid things sometimes I guess. He said himself that was stupid of course.\n\nI don\u2019t know I\u2019m not sure if he was gambling. I will maybe ask him today. Tell him that I find it hard to trust him. Also I think he really might have changed. \nHe has a hard time trusting me as well, he always thinks I cheat on him (which I haven\u2019t). I hope the counseling will help maybe to rebuild the trust. I kind of would like to see his bank account balance as proof he hasn\u2019t been gambling but then again, when I need to see that to believe him I obviously have no trust. So I think I won\u2019t ask him for that."]}
