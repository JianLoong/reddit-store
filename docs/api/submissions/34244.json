Though speaking as an overweight person, it's a surprisingly difficult thing to notice, and even harder to admit is true.\n\nBack in a previous job, I was racking my brains trying to work out how my thin coworkers stayed thin. Eventually I noticed that it was simple. They didn't eat very much. I ate probably twice as much as them, or more, at lunchtime.\n\nAdmitting that I had a problem with overeating was harder. The problem is that those of us who overeat do it not because we're hungry but because we have an emotional connection to food. It is primarily an emotional issue.\n\nThis is important to remember, if you as a third party point out that we're overeating, that you're dealing with a complex cocktail of emotions. Guilt, shame, frustration, amongst others. \n\nIt is not primarily an intellectual issue. I know intellectually that I eat too much, but though I've made progress, I haven't stopped. The reason is because it is a function of my emotions, and those are harder to deal with. It's not a million miles away from why alcoholics drink and drug addicts take drugs.", "NTA. As a bigger girl who has lost a lot of weight in the past, my experience is that the truth hurts and she\u2019s lashing out at you for saying it. It\u2019s one thing internally knowing how you\u2019re sabotaging yourself and compartmentalizing it, but when someone actually acknowledges that, it\u2019s very hard to accept. Sounds like she needs the wake-up call. Be aware that it\u2019ll take her time to accept the issue or she might not ever come to terms with it. You\u2019re not the issue, just the messenger.", "NTA - maybe you did not say it in the most polite way but she asked a question and you gave her an answer.\n\nHopefully this is the wake up call she needs to start having healthier eating habits. It sounds like she binge eats and does not realize how much she consumed. She needs professional help, counseling and a nutritionist. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. You don\u2019t police her eating or anything like that. You just told the truth. She is in denial.", "NTA - you're correct.\n\nSounds like she needs to learn about portion sizes, calorie intake, and calorie usage. \n\nJust because you are eating fresh home cooked food, doesn't mean that you can eat unlimited amounts of it.", "3 chicken breasts in one meal and she don\u2019t know why she is big ?

And in theory, if you\u2019re cooking with butter and cream, a more reasonable portion should be more filling, right?

There\u2019s a nice way to say it (\u201chm, I\u2019ve noticed you have big portions, could that contributing?\u201d) and a mean way (\u201cLOL are you serious?? It\u2019s obviously because you eat like five times more than me, no wonder you\u2019re ballooning up. How do you not see that??.\u201d) I don\u2019t know which you did, but the fact you don\u2019t want to apologize for hurting her feelings isn\u2019t a good sign. \n\nAlso, consider that people (esp those who are overweight+) are really, really bad at gauging how much they eat. Her mind probably has her jumping through all sorts of hoops (\u201cwell, I ate a little bit more at dinner, but it\u2019s just chicken, plus I saw OP eat a small snack earlier so it definitely evens out\u201d). She probably has no idea how much she\u2019s actually eating.", "NTA\n\nDIL, I'm sorry my cooking isn't working out for your diet. I'll stop making your and my son's portion.

It sounds like she wants an excuse or pandering instead of taking responsibility. Like did she expect you to lie and say, \"it's genetics/medical\"?

I replied, yes, it is, but you still look good. She was so mad at me and was telling people that I had called her fat. Her little sister and another friend tried to convince me that I was the asshole and that I needed to apologize. I refuse to. If she didn\u2019t want an answer she shouldn\u2019t have asked the question. So many people want platitudes and to have their egos stroked. \n\nAnd I shared a place with my sisters for a while and my husband and I would buy groceries and I would do all the cooking. Because I was paying for it, I was hyper aware of everyone\u2019s consumption and could easily tell you my 5\u20193 110 pound sister was eating more than my 6\u2019 240 husband.  \n\nYoure NTA for noticing and NTA for being honest with her. \n\nSo many people on Reddit are obsessed with \u201cbut you could\u2019ve said it nicer\u201d advice. I don\u2019t know if you snapped or not, but I can see how if she is quite literally eating 3x the portion, that would piss you off.

We really don\u2019t know with what tone you delivered this message, but NTA for simply stating a fact.", "NTA. It\u2019s incredible how overweight people sometimes feel entitled to having their delusion of health/normalcy maintained for them. Even when they raise the issue. Your son is enabling it and you\u2019re doing her a favour.", "NTA\n\nOf course portion control is an integral part of weight management.\n\nShe asked & you answered.

She shouldn\u2019t have commented on it if she wasn\u2019t prepared to hear the answer.", "For many years health problems caused me to be overweight. No diet changes impacted my weight at all. My family members acted as though I was being overweight on purpose and was a bad person for it. Now different health problems have caused me to be thin. No diet changes are causing weight gain at all. And of course these family members are treating me as though I've finally turned my life around and I'm a good person. I have encountered so many people with similar experiences. The entire world treats me differently now even though I don't feel any different.\n\nWeight gain and hunger are often caused by things totally outside a person's control, but so many people treat these things nonsensically as a moral failing. I'm sure OP's DIL doesn't *want* to need so much food - who would?\n\nETA: NTA for saying it although it sounds like OP hurt her feelings which won't help anything at all. But also, when she's *living* with OP she's no longer a guest and OP is no longer a host. They're housemates, and DIL needs to adjust her expectations about OP being her provider and server. OP is kind of a dick for the simplistic view of weight. It's rarely simply addition and subtraction, as much as I wish it were.", "They are with you to save money \u2014 are you footing the bill for what seems to be more like feeding 4 people?", "NTA.

One day I finally lost it when she said her usual \u201cI\u2019m so fat\u201d and I said \u201cya you are, saying that everyday won\u2019t make you smaller so maybe you should do something about it\u201d.

And now her knee jerk meltdown proves it.", "NTA\n\nMaybe some overweight people don't realize how much they're eating in comparison to others, but if she's asking you, then this is probably a good time to find out. Maybe she'll notice more now. As long as you weren't being purposely mean with the way you said it, I asee no problem.\n\nI don't think people should ask questions that are a set-up and only have one correct answer, which is a lie or some kind of reassurance. I've done it in the past with something else without even realizing it, and wish someone stopped me in my tracks.\n\nAs a thinner woman, I've had times where I've eaten a larger serving or fast food once a week with friends and had a bigger friend go off on me about how lucky I am and how they wish they could eat like that and be skinny.. even though I know for a fact that they consistently eat like that, often multiple times a day, which is *why* they're bigger than me. I don't know if some people are in denial, are hiding it because of shame, or just somehow don't realize just how much they eat compared to others. But I think maybe your daughter in law will notice now. It would've been rude if you just randomly said that too her. But since she asked, I think it's fine.", "NTA - I'm obese, and I'm currently changing my lifestyle to reduce my weight so I'm very mindful of my calories.

It could be something else all together and she hasn\u2019t identified it in herself yet and truly doesn\u2019t understand how the weight is getting put on because she is having some mental health issues that she doesn\u2019t see yet. Your words may not have been out right rude but I\u2019m guessing your tone and delivery were. Be kind, you never know what battle someone else is facing even if they\u2019re living under your roof. You sound difficult to live with.", "NTA. She's living with you - at this point, you are her landlord, not her host. The fact that you are cooking for her at all is overly kind and she should be thankful.

Stop giving fat people a pass.  Like your DIL, I used to make the choice to eat enough food for 3 people.  Like your DIL, I didn't exercise.  Most fat people make similar choices and are thus, fat; the exception are those with legitimate medical issues that cause weight gain.  You're not an asshole for answering the question she asked.  You didn't body shame her, and you're being a good host by cooking for her.  She's being a poor guest by eating so much. \n\nGaining weight is easy.  Losing it is hard.

Now not so much.\n\nLike a lot of things I read on here, it can't be boiled down to a simple yes/no question.\n\nTechnically you are not wrong, but you hurt the feelings of someone you have to live with.\n\nTake that for what it is and apologize *for hurting her feelings*, not for being wrong (which you aren't)", "NTA she asked you answered.

Open up a dialog and maybe she needs some assistance in lowering her weight.  Be empathetic, helpful and loving.", "NTA no matter what tone you used. She wanted you to come up with some nonsense about why you're not as big as her so she could continue eating ridiculous portions and not feel bad about it.

If you were going for shame and humiliation, then your method worked, cuz she feels those things. \n\nIf you weren\u2019t going for shame and humiliation, but rather you genuinely want to support her stated desire to obtain a healthier weight, then consider the following:\n\n- Content: portion sizes matter. Your content was fine\n- context: There is more context that you may not know- what does your DIL think would be healthy? What has she tried before? For instance, is she always ravenous with smaller portion sizes and thus finding low-calorie-dense food is needed as a bridge? Are you a dietician or have specialized training that could add to the discussion? Do you have expertise to add to the situation and do you have pre-conceived biases about what is and isn\u2019t healthy that may not be supported by fact? Do you have a track record of success in discussion of sensitive subjects?\n- timing: on the one hand, she brought up weight loss, so your timing was reasonable. On the other hand, it\u2019s the winter holidays and vacation. It might have been better to say that dietary choices differ in the holidays and in regular life, but if you\u2019d like to circle back to this topic in January you have some ideas that might help. She might\u2019ve still wanted to talk about things in the moment, but it would\u2019ve acknowledged that it\u2019s a tough time for it.\n- tone and phrasing: it matters so much and impossible to assess via a Reddit post recapping a situation\n- relationship: how close are the two of you? Do you guys regularly talk about touchy subjects in an open and honest way? Does she feel comfortable giving you criticism in return? This impacts how receptive she\u2019ll be and how much you can push", "NTA unfortunately common sense is an endangered species these days.", "I don't necessarily think you're the AH, but if I were in your position my stance would be responding something like \"in the past when I've gained weight and not realised why, I just tracked my calories with an app and it showed me where I was going wrong. It's often down to something I didn't consider\".\n\nNot because you're responsible for her feelings, but it removes you from the equation entirely by pushing the answer to the question back on her.

Apologize anyways, it obviously did hurt her and maybe wasn't received as intended. You could add that as you are the obe cooking, you always observe how much you need to make, what people like and dislike. I also know that my dad eats 3 breadrolls for breakfast or that my mum eats only one slize of whole grain bread for dinner even though I don't even live with them anymore. Reinforce that you don't think her weight or eating habits are any of your business outside of having to plan for it as her host. \n\n\nAs a side note: My sister had a similar baffled overweighr friend over how they eat similarly when hanging out or partying...but overlooked how my sister ate decently the rest of the time. Food habits are difficult to overcome and are a slippery slope to disordered eating. Bodies get used to portion size and appetite can be triggered by basically anything. Classic example: Snacks for movie night. You are not hungry, but if you are used to eating on that couch in the dark with a movie, your body will signal \"you should really have a snack\".", "How are you affording all these chicken breasts? 2 feeds my entire family of 4 and that includes a teenager! If the goal is saving money and being healthy you need to stop the \"serve yourself\" policy. Plate the food for everyone. They may only have second portions if you cook enough food for leftovers (or separate the leftovers you made for packed lunches and store them right when you plate everything else.)\n As to her weight, it's not your business, but an adult woman should be eating like 7-8 servings of fruit or vegetables per day.

She's making all these small decisions which add up\n\nMy body is a direct consequence of actions I've chosen to commit to on a daily basis. It would be ridiculous to get upset if someone told me I was getting fat and I got upset, because I have gotten fatter. This isn't muscle it's fat.

We live at a time when even the concept of objective truth is denied, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that we are left with this bizarre-o land we\u2019re living in.", "\"Creating an extremely fragile and sensitive generation\" \n\nThis is actually so hilarious to me when people say this today, because every single year since like forever have people been saying this exact same thing. I remember reading columns on the news paper that have said that exact statement in the 1930's. Are people really getting sensitive or is it you?", "While you eat three times as much food as I do? lol oh wait", "I personally eat 10.5lbs  of chicken breast per week and I don\u2019t eat 3 breasts in one sitting lol. Let\u2019s assume they are just grilled with minimal seasoning and they are 8oz each. That\u2019s 24oz of chicken breast (my daily allotment) 814 calories and I don\u2019t know what else she is eating at that meal much less throughout the day. I\u2019m not mad I\u2019m impressed.", "My whole family is morbidly obese. It\u2019s genuinely shocking just how much they will eat when left to their own devices, and of course none of it is healthy. Then they sit around watching tv and complaining about their weight-related health issues while having the non-overweight folks to hand them everything since getting up is too difficult.", "What does \"CICO\" means?", "Spot on, this thread is full of babies.", "It's more socially acceptable to castigate people who are abusing with drink, drugs etc... With food we're made to feel as though it's insensitive to have a sensible discussion about food intake/being overweight. Being overweight is unhealthy, leads to illness, decreases life expectancy and puts a strain on the healthcare system. It's cruel to bully people about their weight of course, but it seems dangerous for society to no longer be able to talk about overeating in a sensitive manner.", "Exactly think you.", "And what did DIL want? For OP to just quietly accept the endless comments about her weight? To hype the DIL up every time? Both sound exhausting. I'm not surprised OP had enough and shut down the conversation.\n\nDIL was overstepping all normal boundaries. She was being rude and passive-aggressive. *She's* the one who should focus on saving the relationship, especially since *she's* the one currently dependent on it.", ">ashamed but doesn't know how to handle those emotions.\n\nThis is the crux of it. Yes, OP probably could have phrased it better (but i think the lions share of that one rests with DIL - don't fish for compliments with dynamite) \n\nThe rest is that DIL feels embarrassed and insecure, but instead of expressing that she needs gentler communication about these topics because she has her own issues, she's trying to punch the world back into her rosy view before the glasses were knocked off. Making OP state she was wrong and is sorry does nothing to teach DIL to self soothe / learn to properly communicate / avoid sensitive topics herself to avoid this to begin with. \n\nWhat a stupid argument, doubly so as they're biting the hand that feeds 3x", "My dad died from diabetes and people knew it and would still offer him stuff he wasn\u2019t supposed to be eating.\n\nLetting them overeat and never mentioning it is far worse. I\u2019m with you on this one.", "Spot on.", "Yup. Sometimes the truth hurts.", "Sound like hyper sensibility of the new generation.  \n\n\nI don't think her respond was harsh but straight. And the DIL question sound like hypocrite; Why you are slim type of question, but offended when answered with the obvious the person eat for \"3\".", "No one's suggesting that? Regardless of whether you agree the DIL should be hurt, she is. And a decent person can reflect on the impact they've made regardless of the intent. Maybe there's reflection to be done from OP on tone or bluntness here - I don't know - even if you feel certain that you did nothing wrong, it's still possible to feel regret or upset that your words negatively impacted on someone else.  That isn't eggshells, it's compassion and not doubling down just to be right.", "lol you're not married are you?  \n\nYou know what I'm talking about, but I get the desire to want to be obtuse and stubborn about it.  If you CARE that you hurt someone's feelings, then you would apologize, because you CARE.  If you don't care, then that's totally fine. But I mean, good luck with that :)", "And there are kind respectful ways to answer her question with that fact, and there mean nasty ways to do it too. Telling the truth doesn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t being an asshole. 7 year olds understand this concept.", "Good luck with your endeavours !", "I understand what you're saying and I do agree with it, to a certain extent.\n\nPeople discuss \"boomers\" as a whiney generation that complains that the younger generations can't handle the world they way they did. They think that participation trophies creates babies and non-competative athletes. That, to me, is unreasonable.\n\nThis situation is not the same. You can't expect everyone to apologize to you for everything that upsets you, then claim that everyone else is sensitive. That's perpetuating mental health issues. There was nothing harsh said. There was no opinion forced upon DIL. OP was asked a question and they answered it directly.\n\nWhat will happen at work? If DIL asked her boss \"Hey, why haven't I gotten a promotion yet but Employee #2 has?\" and the boss says \"well you did not perform the same as Employee #2 because of X, Y and Z. Keep working on those things and I think you'll have what it takes to be promoted\", the DIL cannot run to HR and demand an apology. She asked her boss why and she was told why. End of conversation.\n\nPeople need to learn how to self reflect instead of expecting everyone to do it for them.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.

Multi chambered stomach like a cow?\n\nA serving size of raw chicken breast is 3-4 ounces.\n\n10.5 lbs is 42 servings per week at 4oz. 1,070 grams of protein Just from the chicken in a week, when most folk have a Total protein need of like 380g/week.\n\nAre you a hockey player or bulking weight lifter or something?\n\nI like chicken.  But I\u2019d be clucking and growing feathers if I ate that much.", "I feel like this is a lie by the OP. No way she is eating 3 chicken breasts. I bet she is is serving small pieces of chicken and not whole breasts. And OP is undereating with her own food issues.", "Yes, and make snarky backhanded compliments and question whether habits/hobbies that require physical activity are \u201chealthy\u201d or not.

At least I\u2019d be able to walk around, go places, do things, up until I die. My intention is not to fat shame here, just to agree that I find it strange that the general consensus these days is that alcohol and drug abuse is bad, but being severely overweight is \u201cnormal\u201d and the person is \u201cequally as beautiful and healthy\u201d.", "all those fat acceptance activists, dying from obesity before they're 40\n\nsometimes you would want to be delicate and cuddle the relationship, sometimes it's just too time-sensitive - it's not that you're harsh when it's just hard facts", "Right? It all started because DiL made her own observations about OPs weight.", "She should quit remarking on MIL\u2019s weight all the time if she doesn\u2019t want to talk about weight and FACTS.  She opened up this conversation", "Exactly. And not to mention the types of comments like DiLs that started the whole thing tend to be said in a way to make the person who's skinnier feel bad about it. Kind of like a \"must be nice\" type of way.

Love your Eeuphemisms!", "Well, firstly, im in the camp that OP doesn't have to apologize, but i just want to point out that no one is saying OP needs to say she's wrong.. just apologize for the fact that she had hurt her feelings. But i am a petty AH. People seem to also be missing the fact that daighter in law offend OP first. OP is clearly conscious about her portions. To have someone in front of you shovel down 3 entire chicken breasts and then squak at you about how you guys should be the same ? That gtfo thats offensive, too. I'd have answered back probably a lot harsher. But that's where i say i know im an AH, so what's my opinion really worth here? ya know, lol", "It's possible, but not always necessary. The one who should be doing reflection is DIL.", "7 year olds also understand the concept of people responding with factual information when you claim something doesn't make sense. None of us actually heard her tone. Claiming that someone saying that of course a person who eats a lot more will be bigger is automatically \"nasty\" without knowing anything more about the actual tone is just looking for reasons to be offended. Instead of making assumptions, one should ask OP for more info on how the line was delivered."]}
