However she is really taking advantage of you.\n\nShe is not your young child so you should not be clearing up her sick.  That's gross and she should be doing it herself.  She is in the early stages of pregnancy so can get her own stuff if she needs it and stop being lazy.  Similarly she can continue to contribute to the housework the way she used to.  \n\nIf you give her a lift to appointments from time to time that's nice but if you cant then she can get a public transport like everyone else.  \n\nHow does she expect to cope towards the end of the pregnancy or when the baby is born?  If I were you I would be suggesting she moves in with the father or her parents.  If not start looking for another place as you will end up being expected to be the surrogate parent for a child that isnt yours.", "NTA she\u2019s totally using you and acting very entitled about it.  You keep setting clear boundaries and yet she continues to break them.  Why doesn\u2019t she make the father of the baby take her to her appointments? Or ask other people?  You should sit down with her when cooler heads prevail and have.

If you're the baby's father that changes everything.", "NTA\nBut what about her partner? Does she have one?\nYou did help her out but you cannot and should not disrupt your whole life because she's pregnant. Ultimately, it is like you said, not your problem. \nJust because she's pregnant (and not in the late months) doesn't mean she couldn't go to the store, cook lunch or clean the house", "Eh. NAH. Pregnancy hormones can change a lot of a person's personality and energy levels. It definitely is hard to get through alone. And you're right, it isn't your responsibility.

I would've snapped much sooner than that. \n\n Now the real problem is what is she gonna do after the baby is born? If the plan is to keep staying with you, i'd strongly suggest you to find another roommate. She is entitled now, wait till she has the kid and would think that the sun rises on her bundle of poo.", "NTA Unless you impregnated her, this is not your problem. \n\nYou entered into an agreement when you moved in with each other and pregnancy care was probably not in the initial agreement. \n\nYou can be as accommodating as you like, but it's not your responsibility. Also what's her plan post-delivery? Are you going to have a third roommate suddenly appear that you didn't bargain for?

Assuming you\u2019re not the father, of course. \n\nNTA. But your life is going to to get very chaotic early next year if K is still your roommate.~~\n\nYTA! And a troll.
