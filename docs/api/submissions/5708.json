He was with their mom Lana for a small period of time and they broke up while she was pregnant with my niece. When the kids were 4 and 5 my brother started dating SIL. SIL and Lana did not get along and there was a feud there until Lana passed away when the kids were 7 and 8. SIL actually had an argument with our family a few times over Lana. Lana had primary custody. My brother had them every other weekend due to distance. So most of the time, if we had a family party or something, we would ask Lana if the kids could go, which pissed SIL off. She felt we should ask my brother. She was also pissed off Lana would not let my brother or her answer for the kids when they didn't have them. It was a whole mess. The kids knew about the issues between Lana and SIL and when their mom died, they remained distant from SIL and rejected her offers to adopt them. I do think they rejected any kind of love from her and kept their walls entirely up. After several years it became clear they were planning to go no contact as soon as possible.\n\nThis is what they did when my niece moved out of the house in July. Pretty sure SIL is the only person who doesn't know (because she won't accept) that the kids have no desire for a relationship with her.\n\nSIL invited the kids for Christmas but they never replied. They do not respond to any contact from her. But I have kept in touch with the kids and asked if they wanted to join my family for Christmas. They said sure. They were here. Posted photos with me. SIL saw my husband and I tagged in the photos and she told me I should have told her they were coming and accused me of treating her like shit. She said I knew she was ignored, which I did, and a good person would have given her a heads up. She said she cannot believe I am okay with all of this, which I assume she means she can't believe I'm okay with the kids ignoring her and not maintaining a relationship with her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672059960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvmr3j/aita_for_not_telling_my_sil_my_nephew_and_niece/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your niece and nephew were with you, because you are family that they feel connected to. They are old enough to reject invitations on their own. Your SIL has made herself irrelevant in their lives.

As someone who is low/no contact with my mother, I wouldn\u2019t want my trusted family members to be sharing my business. They are adults and can spend holidays with whomever they want.

Your SIL is the one that ruined the chance for a real relationship with the. If you had told your SIL she would have shown up and your niece and nephew would realize they couldn't trust you.

Good for you inviting them over to spend Christmas with you and your family.", "NTA of course. It is not your job to mediate between adults.", "NTA - SIL needs to realize that actions have consequences. She is an overgrown toddler, but good on the kids for establishing their boundaries with her. You're not letting her childish behavior negatively impact your relationship with your niece and nephew, and that is a great thing. They need loving family members after that big of a loss. \n\nI hope you all enjoyed your holidays together ...and just throw some water on the wicked witch the next time she gets sassy.", "Nta for including your family", "NTA. Your niece and nephew are old enough to make their own choices. Remind your SIL of this. They don\u2019t like her because of their mother Lana and they never will because of xyz with Lana. It\u2019s not your fault that they want a relationship with you since you never picked SIL or Lana\u2019s side. Because you\u2019ve always been neutral to them and had their best interests at heart. Your niece and nephew know this. They just aren\u2019t saying anything because they don\u2019t want to deal with the blowup from it.", "Not the asshole, these kids are adults making their own decision.  Not enough info here to say whether or not I agree with them or they are being petty because of what they believe were issues between their mom and step mom they only understand one side of.\nEnd of the day tho, adults who owe your SIL nothing, and you are right to respect their positions, whether or not you agree.\n\nYou have all the info here.  Maybe it would be beneficial to unpack it all for your sister in law so she understands why these kids want nothing to do with her, and determine if anything can be done to make improvements.", "NTA.  As you said this situation is messy.  While I empathize with your SIL ultimately your niece and nephew are legally adults, capable of making their own decisions in life. It doesn't help that from the way describe the situation that SIL's attempt to connect to your niece and nephew seems to have come off as overbearing.", "INFO - Where is your brother in all of this?", "NTA. Your relationship with your niece and nephew is independent of her relationship with her stepchildren. They decided to go NC and it\u2019s not your place to interfere with it.", "OP=NTA\n\nThis is the comment that I found most illustrative:  <<*She was also pissed off Lana would not let my brother or her answer for the kids when they didn't have them.>*\\>\n\nOf course, you would ask and get permission from LANA not brother & SIL for the kids visiting you when LANA has physical custody.  How would that work?  You call brother and get permission for them to visit, then they'd have to go to LANA and get her permission.  That's just ridiculous.  It was all about control from the beginning with SIL.  \n\nAnd she was so bad at it the kids want nothing to do with her.   You don't owe your SIL any knowledge of their plans, that is for them to communicate TO her, if they want her to know.", "NTA.  They are adults.  You\u2019d think by now she\u2019d see the writing on the wall.\nShe screwed up by treating their mother like crap. Be sure to share that with her.", "NTA, however\n\nNot everything has to be on SM.  If you want to discrete about something and avoid hassle, don't post pics and such that everyone else can see, unless you lock the privacy settings.", "NAH.\nEven if I understand why SIL is sad because of all the situation, I also think it's okay for you to host your nephew and niece and respect their choices. If there's an asshole here, this is your brother. It's really sad is the stepmother who cares about the children, and not the father. Maybe that's because of this that they never get to experience brother and SIL like family.\nThis situations suck, but they're adults now, and both you and them are allowed to choose by yourselves which kind of relationship you do want to have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
