Yesterday, I spent all day selling powerball tickets because of the billion dollar jackpot. The day went about average until after we closed the lotto machine, and I had about ten minutes of slow time before I had to start cleaning the office.\n\nAlmost every night, no more than ten minutes until closing, another employee (produce, I think) comes to buy a couple of things, always pays with cash, and always interrupts my cleaning/closing rituals. There's never a line at the open register, and he never used the self checkout (not really an option anymore since we recently stopped accepting cash at the self checkouts).\n\nLast night was no different, he put down two cans of condensed milk and leaves to grab something from the deli. I didn't do anything because I just wanted him to leave. After a little while (about 5-8 minutes) I look towards the deli. He's just standing there talking with a few employees, so I get upset, put the cans back on the shelf, and throw up a lane closed sign, planning to act like it's always been there.\n\nI keep on cleaning, and he keeps on talking, eventually coming back while I'm cleaning. Drat, I wanted to have finished and been taking the damaged stuff to the back by then.\n\nHe's understandably upset that I put his stuff back, raises his voice, and I raise mine. I tell him I can't have him coming through while I'm cleaning, always paying cash, for something the closing cashier could easily do for him. He ran off to get a manager and threatened to report me and take me into the managers office tomorrow for the manager to chew me out. I told him it's whatever and I don't care.\n\nI explained all of this to him before, several times, and he keeps coming back, doing the same thing he always does.\n\nBecause he's significantly older than I am, my mom says it was super disrespectful and I went too far. My customer service coworkers also say I shouldn't have handled it that way because our company's biggest marketing point is a reputation for above-and-beyond customer service.\n\nMeanwhile, my brother, a friend of mine who used to be a manager at an outdoor goods store (currently a retail cashier somewhere else), and a couple of deli associates said that it wasn't right for him to interrupt my closing, a few of them recommending that next time I take my till to the cash office so I can't check him out if I wanted to.\n\nIt's not even that he's paying with cash or interrupts my work, it's that he does this all the time. Hell, I'd even settle for him at least being polite, all I get from him is a glare and a couple of grunts.\n\nDid I mess up?", "created_utc": 1667308385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj8ddv/aita_for_yelling_at_another_employee/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Despite politely explaining the situation to them in the past, the sign was not up, I knew they planned to buy, and we still had a few minutes before closing so the store was very much open.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why is it any different when a coworker, who\u2019s a paying customer, does the same thing? If you originally had the closed lane sign up in the first place, that\u2019s an indication for him to move onto the next lane. In this particular instance, since he took his time talking to someone, and you knew this was a coworker, why not approach the guy and say \u201chey, are you going to check out? I\u2019m going to be done in (reasonable time), please be ready to go by then,\u201d and complete your duties. Should you have returned his items? No. Set it aside until you\u2019re done and return it with the rest of the products.\n\nUltimately, it doesn\u2019t matter if he \u201cdoes it all the time,\u201d there\u2019s no reason to not provide the guy with good customer service. Unless he\u2019s being unreasonable."]}
