This time seems to be more permanent (which we are totally fine with), at least until she goes to college. My daughter, her friend, and my son are all seniors. They have senior fees coming up, the total amount is almost around $1000. Senior fees cover graduation, photos, trips, etc..My husband and I already have to pay both our daughter and our sons fees. Plus they also have prom coming up. The mother of my daughters friend isn\u2019t paying any of her fees. My husband and I agreed that we wouldn\u2019t pay it either, we cannot afford to spend that much money on someone who isn\u2019t our child. We did talk to our daughter and told her if she wanted to sit out on some senior activities, to give her friend half her money she could. My daughter basically threw a tantrum and said we\u2019re being unfair, she says her friend is already living with us and \u201ctreated like part of the family\u201d so she should be treated equally and given the same opportunities. I do feel terrible that she has to miss out on senior activities. I also feel a little guilty about it, but she isn\u2019t my child and I shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay just because her own mother won\u2019t.

What the eff?! Like, does this poor girl not get to graduate on stage if she doesn't ante up? Aren't photos paid for when a package is purchased?", "NAH. That's a really tough situation to be in, for everyone involved.\n\nAre you able to encourage her to get some assistance via the school?  There are a lot of resources for minors in difficult financial and abuse situations.  Maybe help her schedule an appointment with her school's counselor to see what is available.", "NTA\n\nYou essentially took on another child without compensation (I'd imagine). She's got free room and food and a stable home. \n\nAlso $1000 is insane. I think mine were like $75 or $100...but that was 24 years ago... fuck", "NAH\n\nYour daughter is fighting for her friend and has a kind heart. Something it seems she come by honestly. My suggestion would be to reach out to teachers/school/ local organizations that might be able to assist. You are in a rough position.\n\nAlso, maybe set your daughter down and tall to her about how you do understand what her friend is going through and how you are doing everything you can to support her. Just like your daughter is doing. Try to see if she has any ideas the funds could be raised. Possibly in a not so public way so that the friends' situation is not made awkward.", "NTA, but really sucks for everyone involved. I'd call the school, explain the situation, and see if they can comp some of the activities for her, especially graduation.", "Nah.  The school might have a fund for kids who can't afford it.  Maybe you can check and see", "NAH.  You've taken on an extra responsibility in taking in this friend.  This was not something you had planned.  If you can't afford it, you can't afford it.  Meanwhile, I understand your daughter's feelings.  You've taken in the friend, accepted her as part of the family.  Your daughter wants the best for her.    \n\n\nI'm a bit concerned about how you ended this post, though.  About being forced to pay.  Makes me think that you just don't want to pay (which is your right) rather than you can't afford it.  Just be honest with the reason.", "NTA \n\nYou are already giving her a place to live and supporting her. You can't afford to pay that much money and it's okay. This money wasn't a surprise, so the friend could have gotten a job to cover expenses. I wonder if your daughter promised her friend that you would cover it.\n\nI had a similar situation with one of my kid's friends. I housed him and fed him, but didn't have the money for any extra.", "NTA I think it\u2019s a great opportunity for the friend to get a part time job or try fundraising. I couldn\u2019t get a lot of senior year perks because of finances but I did also pay for the things I wanted because I had a part time job, if she really wants it she can def work for it, especially with her being a senior now and her unfortunate situation she def needs to learn self reliance now more then ever because in a few months high school is done and the next chapter opens up. You don\u2019t write about any bitterness towards the friend or even come off as the type I think that if you chose to pay for even one thing on the list it would be extremely nice on your behalf but that shouldn\u2019t be expected. I know senior year the whole class fundraised in order for every senior to get a yearbook. There\u2019s alot of peaceful options here instead of it quickly becoming the end of the world for her like a lot of teenagers jump to feeling.", "NTA You're already housing and feeding this kid, why should you be picking up senior fees? A 17 year old can certainly find a part time job to cover it or her mother needs to at least do something", "NTA. Can you help the girl find a job to pay for the fees? \n\nI would sit my daughter down (without her friend) and have a very serious conversation with her. She needs to understand you're already going above and beyond. It's completely inappropriate for her to throw a tantrum at her age. She should be thankful for what you're already doing. \n\nThank you for taking this girl in and doing all you already have for her. My parents were always taking in stray kids who needed a place to stay and food to eat. I have a lot of respect for people who do what you're doing.", "NTA.  Sad situation, but if you don\u2019t have the money, you don\u2019t have the money.", "NTA.  Continue to tell your daughter to give half of her money to her friend. Tell her friend to get a job if she wants any extras.    \n\nYou have supported this girl by giving her shelter with utilities and food.  She needs to speak to her mother, father or grandparents about extras.  You are under no obligations to provide anything beyond what you are doing.", "NTA. Uh no, just no. You\u2019re already being generous by extending your home to her. At this point you might as well legally adopt her if you\u2019re going to begin covering these kinds of expenses. At her age she is more than able to work to make her own income and pay for extra activities and things outside what you\u2019ve provided her from your generosity. Your daughter is obviously upset and at her age it\u2019s unrealistic to expect her to understand where you\u2019re coming from but hopefully in due time she will.", "NTA. If you can\u2019t pay, you can\u2019t pay. You\u2019re already doing more than enough by housing your daughter\u2019s friend either the poor girl needs a job or her mother needs to step up. Is there anyone else in her family that can pay, like a father?", "NTA, you can't afford it, so you can't do it, your daughter will understand one day. The love and care youve given to the abused friend is more beneficial than the senior activities ever will be, and thats what you should explain to them.", "NTA, though I feel so sorry for the poor girl. Where\u2019s her dad in this?", "NTA but can you look into some kind of benefit or child support legal option? The mom isn't allowed to abandon a minor in the US.", "NTA. But your daughter is out of touch with reality. Instead of being grateful you opened your house for her friend, she's acting all entitled. You shouldn't pay for the prom for your daughter either. They both can get jobs and earn money for this. I hope the friend at least is pitching in with some chores in your house.", "NTA\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford it then you can\u2019t afford it. You\u2019re not an AH for not having enough money, you have quite a few kids to pay for! What you\u2019ve done already is incredible and very kind and I hope she appreciates it. \n\nI feel like if I was you and I could afford it, I would pay for her, just because the situation is complicated and ultimately I wouldn\u2019t want her feeling left out. But it wouldn\u2019t be an unfair or unreasonable thing for you to refuse to pay, especially when you\u2019ve done so much already.", "NTA.\n\nYou're already being beyond generous in opening your home. \n\nFunny how hypocritical your daughter got when you offered a very reasonable compromise to  split her fees - it's fine if you sacrifice, but not her...", "NTA. Not your responsibility.", "NTA you are doing so much to support her already and $1k is a fair amount on top of that support. Yes it sucks for the kid but her parents need to be stepping up.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d look into a kinship care arrangement with the state.  You could approach this kids parent by saying this arrangement would allow you to be the legal guardian without them giving up their rights. There\u2019s usually financial support from the state for this as well.", "NTA. It\u2019s a sucky situation, but money doesn\u2019t grow on trees. Life\u2019s not fair. It would\u2019ve been nice if your daughter would\u2019ve split the money with her \u201cbest friend\u201d but looks like she doesn\u2019t want to sit any activities out even if her \u201cbest friend\u201d isn\u2019t going. Yikes.", "NTA.\n\nYou're already feeding and sheltering this young woman, which is very gracious of you.\n\nI understand that your daughter is upset, but she needs to learn that life is sometimes just not fair.  Also, she needs to understand that your family has limited finances for the \"extra\" things, and that paying for her friend's senior fees is one of those extras, and was never planned for.  It's hard seeing a friend miss out, but if your daughter isn't willing to give up some things so her friend can participate, then that's her decision to make.\n\nAs others have suggested, please check with the school to see if there are funds for low income families, or if some fees can be comped.", "NTA.. the kid wants to make an adult decision, they need to know the consequences of making such choices.", "INFO if she was another biological child of yours, could you afford to pay it?", "NAH. \n \nShe can't get a part time job to cover even half? \nIs it $1000 for the two kids? So $500 per kid? If it is the tell her to save up $250 and you cover the rest. Best discuss the post-graduation future too. She may be expecting help.", "NAH\n\n$1000 is a lot of money. But I sympathize with the friend for having such a shitty childhood.\n\nI recommend making a deal with her, like paying through some kind of part-time job or house work. You'd be earning yourself a lot of good will with her and your daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had my niece from another country living with me during HS years and she asked about discounts for prom tickets since her parents couldn\u2019t financially contribute and she was gonna get tickets free, senior photos free, and were taking her to get a free prom dress (non profit providing used dresses) but COVID messed that up.

If you bought the fancy, engraved, metallic invitations from the company the school picked, they charged extra for everything- the velleum sheets that you put in the invitation to keep the metallic ink from rubbing off, the little cards that had your name on them. You could buy the basic invite with the time and date, but the salespeople looked like you kicked a puppy if you did that.  I saw the prices and made my own through an online company.

What if not everyone wants to/can go on the senior trip? Why is there a surcharge for senior photos but not underclassman? ***Why do you have to pay to graduate?!***", "But that scenario is buy-in on a per event basis.

But still, $1k/kid sounds ridiculous. Even if it was $500/kid, my graduating class at the time was 600 students so that\u2019s a budget of $300k which seems super high to me.

College applications aren't free and application fees can rack up pretty quickly. It might be time to sit this girl down, outline what expenses you're willing to cover, and help her come up with a game plan for the remainder.

I mean it's basically abandonment  if she doesn't compensate you for caring for her daughter. When my ex left home as a teen, his grandmother paid his foster family for his care.

She is still a minor and therefore should be with her legal guardian. If that can't be her parents, steps should be taken to protect her future.\n\nThat being said, there has to be ways for her fees to be forgiven or at least broken up into separate fees that can be picked and chosen, if not paid in installments.
