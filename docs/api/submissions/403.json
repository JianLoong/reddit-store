He\u2019s meant to be an adult man.", "NTA, why would you apologize for asking him to. ot slam the doors shut? even if he is angry and going through a lot, it's disrespectful at best and a red flag at worse.\n\nalso he can hurt the cat or a kid (if you have any) if he keeps slamming doors shut.", "NTA\n\n\nFrustration is valid but slamming doors is not a way to deal with that. \n\n\nIf he needs an out for his emotions - physical activity can be managed in a more healthy way.", "NTA. sounds like be should get a punching bag or something. a lot of people dislike slammed doors around them since there's almost never a good reason a door is slammed, and there's also plenty of people who have bad experiences following or preceding slammed doors", "NTA. He\u2019s not to slam doors because he\u2019s not a spoiled child in a tantrum. You are entitled to have him handle life\u2019s minor disappointments like an adult. He is NOT entitled to inflict his  personal drama on the world. He\u2019s without manners, without respect for others. \n\nHe dismissed & disrespected you. You are partners. He doesn\u2019t get to just ignore what you ask. If he does not make an effort to control his his volatile nature at home, it will come out at work. And he will lose his job and your security. This is a real issue of respect for others. Jack his ass until he knocks it off. It\u2019s unacceptable. \n\nAdults should never feel entitled to explode in a way that impacts others. Emotionally reactive people are the absolute worst to be around, IMHO. They shred everybody\u2019s nerves. And they DGAF about the feelings of those who have to endure their bad behavior.", "NTA. Why should you have to put up with him acting out his anger in your home? It's unreasonable and sounds like his feelings are more valid than yours. The level of anger seems out of proportion to events so maybe he needs to learn to manage it better. That or get him a punchbag and some boxing gloves.", "NTA. He's being violent, loudly violent, on a regular basis in your personal space and across the house.

Sure you may not be scared of him or anything like that, but that's not the point. Venting anger through violence and destructive behaviour only enforces the unhealthy coping habits.

Again, I speak from years of experience - it took me bloody years of self reflection, medication, and therapy to figure this stuff out.", "If you have children then he is teaching them that this behavior is how grown adults act. \nNTA.", "NTA. Slamming doors and breaking things is another form of abuse. He wants his opinion to be heard. He clearly doesn't have a healthy way to deal with his anger. You called it out because him doing that puts you into a \"fight or flight\" mode. It's important for him to recognize that and understand what he's doing to avoid being upset the rest of the day is hurting you. He's transferring his anger to you. Of course he's in a better mood after that. And it's entirely unfair to you.   \n\n\nSince he's now mad again, is he continuing to slam doors? Or is he dealing with his anger in a different way?

He just might not be aware.", "NTA Your husband is slamming doors and cursing loud enough for you to be frightened so that he can push some of his anger off onto you. If he is awake and unhappy, he wants you to also be awake and unhappy. That is very sad. And scary. I'm sorry you have to deal.with someone who cannot control his own emotions. You must be wondering if he will slam you against something. That is hard.", "You may not be scared of him, but he will eventually take his anger out on you.", "NAH\nIt sounds like husband feels slamming doors is a good way to get his frustration out of his system so he can move on with his day instead of simmering about it. That's fine on its own, everyone should have a way to get those feelings out. He probably doesn't think it's a big deal because once he does it, he's done.\n\n\nBUT it sounds like when his method for this is slamming doors, it's negatively impacting your mood and feeling of peace in your own house. Sure he feels better but now YOURE stuck being upset. Of course you don't enjoy hearing someone angrily slam around your home/safe space, who would? So he's not ELIMINATING this frustration and negative energy, he's just TRANSFERING those feelings to YOU. That's not fair to you! You are not a dumping ground for his irritation.\n\n\nHe needs to find a constructive way to process and expell these negative feelings that doesn't impact you this way so you both can enjoy a peaceful existence. There are lots of methods/outlets and even toys for releasing frustration, he just needs to find one that isn't slamming doors.", "NAH - You're describing an anxiety attack, according to my last 3 psychiatrists. I emote LOUDLY when I'm looking for something, along with the slamming, etc is a form of stimming. \n\nHe can control it, if he can identify it as it happens. \n\nIt has taken me years to break this behavior, so I feel bad for both of you.
