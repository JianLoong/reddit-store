And my dog is a tiny goofy idiot that is afraid of the neighbors cat.", "Dude\u2026 \u201cwhat do I do?\u201d Bitch your dog is a menace due to your negligence and I\u2019m contacting animal control. It killed my fucking pet. *pictures for social media of the dog and owner* Your dog is a danger to society and needs put down.  Don\u2019t run either because I will make it my life\u2019s mission to find your ass.", "I\u2019m a little confused. Could you just explain what you mean please? What does beneathneath mean?", "The cat's the victim here, dude", "How is the dog a victim?", "Stolen comment, bad bot.", "I agree, but it doesn\u2019t matter how much I agree, it\u2019s still going to happen.", "Curse those counter-revolutionary canines!", "100%. The dog that killed the rabbit dropped it after snapping its neck and just pranced around all happy and wagging its tail. \n\nI\u2019m sure the dog has no idea what it did was wrong or the distress of everyone around it. The owner just stood there dumbly, while his happy dog pranced around.", "I think because the norm here is that \u201cdogs can go outdoors\u201d but other animals usually don\u2019t in the city, they expect outdoor areas and parks to be expected for dogs. Just because something is common, doesn\u2019t make it the rule. \n\nUnfortunately, MANY dogs here are extremely untrained. Their owners just want a pet and have no idea how to raise/train/control it. I\u2019ve had dogs go crazy and try to bite me and their owners just go \u201chey. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d while doing nothing to control the dog.", "> TA- the owner of the dog should be angry at himself for not having control over his dog.\n\nTA- the proprietor ofTA- the proprietor of the canine must be indignant at himself for now no longer having manipulate over his canine. the canine must be indignant at himself for now no longer having manipulate over his canine.", "And the cat's owner. She was put in reasonable apprehension of harm both to herself and her pet. The dog isn't going to be all nicey-nice with the owner who's holding a cat in her backpack.\n\n\"Excuse me, please. I'm just trying to kill your cat.\"", "you\u2019re right, it will. the entitlement of these dog owners are unbelievable sometimes. I don\u2019t get the logic of not allowing cats as well as dogs?\n\n\ni\u2019m going to get downvoted for saying this because that\u2019s just how this sub is, but \u201cdogs over cats every time!!\u201d attitude dog owners have feels really similar to misogyny for some reason \ud83e\udd14", "I mean, here I don't usually see people walking their cats or their rabbits. But although my dog may be the cutest dog ever to me, not everyone is gonna love her. Some people are afraid of dogs. Some people don't want dogs near them. Keeping her on a leash is just common courtesy imo.", "I have both and I\u2019d love to take my kitties places! But it\u2019s just proven unsafe. Also, I\u2019ll never take any of mine to a brewery anyways.  I don\u2019t trust drunk people trying to control their dog.", "There is a guy in my hometown who walks both a cat and a rabbit (almost said rabbi lmao) at the same time.\n\nSometimes either of them will be on his shoulder instead. Theoretically both could be but I haven't seen that yet.", "I agree. I keep my kittys home because of this too, I just hope this culture will make a shift soon so that can change in future. I would love to have a kitty I can take everywhere with me lol", "My brother and his wife recently went on a backpacking trip and their kitty went too! The photos were so amazing. I\u2019m gonna post them for you to see.  It\u2019s giving me ideas about taking mine out somewhere that I know they\u2019ll be safe. Maybe you can do the same if you don\u2019t mind the outdoors? https://imgur.com/a/hj3Sl6V"]}
