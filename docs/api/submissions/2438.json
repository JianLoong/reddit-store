I have a dog and a cat and often bring my cat on walks with my dog and I. My cat hangs out in one of those cat backpacks with the little window on it. For context, this isn\u2019t crazy unusual to see in my city, and I probably run into other people who have their cats once a week or so. \n\nI decided to bring my cat with me to the brewery instead of my dog last night. She really loves getting out, and I thought it would be fun for her. This was okayed by the owner beforehand (the brewery is pet friendly, but I explicitly asked about the cat before bringing her). I used the same set up as I do on my walks.\n\nFor context, this brewery is outdoor seating only. It\u2019s not cramped, and it\u2019s pretty easy to avoid other dogs. One guy was already there with his dog when my friends and I came in. We sat down on the opposite side of the brewery and were just chatting when my cat meowed and this guy\u2019s dog went crazy. Like absolutely insane. Barking, lunging, couldn\u2019t get that dog to calm down at all. Way beyond a normal prey response, especially for a cat that wasn\u2019t even visible and meowed be fine. The guy started yelling at me, asking me why I would bring my cat to the brewery etc. I told him I brought her because she likes being out and that I asked before I did. The guy ends up leaving. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole because I was following the rules, made it as unobtrusive for others as possible, and literally no other dog reacted like that one did. I get that having your outing ruined is frustrating, but I feel like if you bring your dog in public in a city like that there\u2019s a baseline expectation of behavior that this guy\u2019s dog didn\u2019t meet.

You brought a pet in compliance with the rules, and you checked first. The dog owner is entirely at fault for failing to properly train his dog.\n\nIf he cannot control his dog around cats (and presumably other small animals, like squirrels), he shouldn't bring his dog in public. That dog might have harmed you in the process of trying to get to your cat. And if that had happened, the dog would have to be destroyed.\n\nThat guy is entirely in the wrong, and he knows it.

My daughter has one of those backpacks and her cat goes everywhere. It makes the cat shockingly chill and laid back somehow. He loves going out in it.

It\u2019s always a treat, people love it. If any dog had problems with that, I would ask their owner to take them and leave.

It sits on their shoulders and is often wearing little dragon wings. It\u2019s amazing.", "NTA. You got permission from the brewery and attempted to negate the effect the cat would have on the dog by sitting far away. The dog might never have acted this way before so the owner might have been flustered trying to get it under control, but that guy had no right to yell at you that way.", "NTA.

I run a couple of outdoor markets, which are very popular with local dog owners. We\u2019re happy for people to bring their pups, but honestly, I don\u2019t get why some dog owners think that places like markets, breweries, caf\u00e9s, etc, are suitable locations to take a dog that isn\u2019t well trained and socialised. Bringing your dog along when you go out is a privilege, and has attendant responsibilities, like cleaning up after them and making sure they know how to behave in public.

But I do question the judgement of someone who brings a cat to a place where there is likely going to be a few dogs around.

Reactive dogs are the owners responsibility, not your fault he was embarrassed by his dogs behaviour and channeled that towards you instead.", "I do think it's super odd to take your cat to a brewery.  Certainly in Australia you'd never expect to see a cat at any pet friendly establishment unless they marketed explicitly about cats - ie pet friendly is widely understood to mean dog friendly rather than any species friendly.  And it's really not unusual to find dogs that hate cats.  I've had 2 different dogs over the years that have hated cats in a cartoon dog kind of way.  So I'd be caught by surprise by a cat at a dog friendly venue and my dog would go completely nuts. \n\nSo, NAH because you checked first and were allowed,  but I can understand the other person's point of view as well and I'd be pretty upset when I was there first and had to leave because someone else brought a cat.

I\u2019ve actually trained him though, and I get him to stop when he does it.

But yeah, totally get that some dogs hate cats, I guess I just assumed as long as she was in the backpack and away from them that was reasonable accommodation enough for those dogs.
