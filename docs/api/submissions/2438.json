By that I mean that people and dogs expect to see other dogs in public and most dogs are (hopefully) trained to behave appropriately in dog-dog encounters; however, most people don\u2019t expect to see cats and rodents on leashes and their dogs may *not* be trained to respond \u201ccorrectly.\u201d\n\nOf course, in a perfect world, all dogs would be expertly-trained and have 100% recall when their owners issue a command but that\u2019s not how it always works. I know someone with an adventure cat and it\u2019s awesome, but his owner also recognizes that *he can\u2019t control all variables when he\u2019s outside*. Instead of risking his cat\u2019s life by taking him to places when they\u2019re heavily trafficked, he only goes during off-peak hours and always brings a backpack carrier to put the cat in if he sees a large pack of dogs coming his way. \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m not trying to victim blame but your example of the rabbit being killed just makes me think its owners were optimistic idiots. They risked their pet\u2019s life by taking a known prey animal outside and expecting the best.

Ball pythons, a common pet snake, used to be bred for color and design and were an important part of court fashion in Igbo courts. Just a bunch of important people with animals on them walking around doing their day to day because that's how lazy these snakes are.\n\nIn contrast, to talk about court animals,  Pekingese were also court animals.

Granted, she was lazy AF, so I would end up carrying her *to* the park, but once there she was always so happy. She had her harness and leash, and I would bring a blanket, and we would just hang out in the sun and she would be purring her ass off the whole time. She was so chill. I used to take her with me when my husband and I would go play frisbee or kick a soccer ball around, I would slip the looped end of her lead under the foot of a bench (no more than 20 feet from me at any point) and she was happy to just hang out and receive head scritches from people passing by. On colder days she had a little hoodie she would wear. She lived to be 19 and loved the park until her dying day. \n\nThis park had some dog visitors, yeah, but not as many as other parks for some reason, so we never really had problems.

I've been told I saw when I was really little but have no memory of when my uncle's hunting dog snapped (most likely from old age as it had never been an issue before) and bit my uncle. But like I said I have no memory of it. He still has hunting dogs but don't use them to go hunting anymore, at least since the dog that had essentially outlived 5 of his doggy friends and had been around for as long as I can remember died. Now his dogs are just little menaces who hates being on a leash and will try to drag you with them and look like tiny bears with all the floof they have. \n\nHowever, I live in an area where there're leash laws and people can control their dogs. If a dog owner is playing with their dog off leash they will ask people walking by if they're ok with the dog or not, and if not they will simply call their dog back so the people can pass without fear of a floof bouncing up to them. It really is that easy. \n\nLike you said, it's common courtesy to have your dog on a leash.", "That is somehwat true, but people *should* know not to bring other pets or small children into dog parks, as it is a place for the dogs to be dogs. While this may not always be the case, most I have seen have rules posted regarding children age, and also have separate areas for smaller dogs from bigger dogs. Its a risk you take going into a dog park, but you should know that dogs will be loose there. A person afraid of dogs should be allowed to go to a public park without worry of an unleashed dog running up to them, but if they go into a dog park they should know its a place for the dogs. My thought process is basically a public park is for the general public, and a dog park is for the dogs. Dogs can go to public parks, but they need to be well mannered because they are in public. A dog park has more leniency towards dogs who are young or not as well trained, within reason. Plus I like to think people who take their dogs to dog parks are more prone to understanding where the behavior is appropriate, and that is why they are there. I know that's not true for all people, but I've met a lot of responsible dog owners at dog parks.", "I hate dogs in playgrounds. The dog owner will say, well there were no kids in the playground and my dog doesn't pee or poop there so it's fine.
