Last wedding I was in, groomsmen set up the venue while the bridesmaids finished getting ready, then at the end of the night, both bridesmaids and groomsmen broke everything down. And it wasn\u2019t even asked of us. We just did it.", "There's \"not 100% smooth\" and then there's the MOH calling the bride on the wedding day to ask where the reception venue was, when she had volunteered to help set up and had a print out of the details.", "True - deffo should have had someone hired in hindsight.\n\nThere are certain things that are out of anyone's control and others that can be mitigated.", "I have apologised and yeah I should have picked up in hindsight", "Did you print it for her", "Did you know that your MoH was completely incompetent before you asked her to be your MoH, or was this new and unprecedented behavior from her?\n\nI tend to be on top of things, so that level of detail would have been more than enough for me, and I'm pretty sure that anyone who knows me would know that, but I know people who would still needs lots of hand-holding even with all of that \u2013 but I wouldn't make any of those people my MoH...", "The groomsmen set up with no one there to provide directions? Yes, setting up and clean up after I have definitely seen and done myself, but to just flat out ignore your friends that are helping you and then say \"mistakes were made\" is really rude.", "I saw that comment after I commented. Yea, that's insane. How does she not know where the venue is.", "Reading more of your comments, some of those things should have been easily handled. Were they also nervous? Lol.", "Aye - I printed it out for her and we went to the restaurant before hand to look at the space with table arrangements", "Tbh I've never planned anything like this before (and with her). Because she was so eager to be my MOH and she has a very thoughtful heart I thought why not.\nIt was a \"glass shattered\" moment because since then I've noticed how bad she is at executing. Planning and dreaming = excellent as lots of ideas. But none that actually come to fruition.", "Aye - I told my MOH I'd be busy getting ready in the morning so no way my phone would be close to me. The day also ended by 8pm so everything happened between 2pm to 7pm (in terms of timings for guests)\n\nWith the town hall there were only 10 people from both sides and my MOH was to be at the reception venue to do the decor (flower placements, cake table, thank you cards and favours) which were all packaged and ready to be placed. Nothing needed to be put together on the day.\n\nFor the Ubers it was my husbands side of the family. Which I definitely have no issue with. I was just annoyed it had to be booked by him on the day because they confirmed they'd do it themselves and delayed us getting to the reception before them.\n\nAnd my husband (bless him for all his kindness) just picked up the calls on the first ring. I told him he can stop if he wants to because everything is in the plans just redirect her to those.", "The mind boggles.", "Isn\u2019t the maid of honour usually just the bride\u2019s closest friend or sister? I can imagine choosing my MOH based on closeness and not vetting her for competency. Sometimes you don\u2019t know how someone\u2019s going to handle the role until they do it. I don\u2019t see how the MOH being useless on the day is the bride\u2019s fault. MOH was given very detailed instructions, everything was planned out for her. If she messed it up, isn\u2019t she the asshole more so than OP for \u201cchoosing\u201d her?", "The bridesmaids dont though", "Yeah, it seems like everyone should have been able to handle it since it was so small and so close together. But this happens at literally every wedding. People lose invitations or forget to bring it with them so they don't have the information on hand. It's shitty but it happens.\n\nBut telling someone your phone won't be close is not the same as saying you will straight up not answer your phone or questions the day of. And the comment about mistakes were made.... Just sits wrong with me. This is your friend, not hired help. And your husband answered her questions, so are you directing that at him as well?\n\nEither way, if it's only your husband complaining, do you want to be right or happy?", "I\u2019m not saying anything OP is the AH at all - this is totally on the MOH. But if you know someone we\u2019ll enough to ask them to be your MOH, surely you know whether they can read and follow instructions?", "My husband was also involved in the planning (or at least knew enough to answer the questions)\nWhen he told me what was being asked I realised after the second time it's gona be the same type of questions. \nIn stubbornness I wanted him to also tell her to read the plans first", "So you don't want to answer your phone calls from the person you assigned to handle everything and you want your husband to also ignore her or rudely tell her (the person doing you a favor/your friend) to read the directions and not call again?\n\nAgain, this is your friend. Yeah, turns out she was not a good pick to run the wedding set up, that sucks! I mean, I read your other comments about how she didn't even know where the reception was so I get your annoyance, but you picked her right? If you don't know whether someone is good at running events, don't choose them to run your important event for you.", "Agreed. We still do things together but the glass has shattered with the planning of events and executing them with that MOH", "It's his wedding too, YTA.", "I have been involved in many weddings where the bride doesn\u2019t have to touch her phone once. BUT there was a mistress and/or masters of ceremony that had met with the bride, groom, parents, MOH and attended the rehearsal dinner. And even then the bride was still brought questions and had to deal with stuff that came up on the day of. \n\nI agree with you that you shouldn\u2019t have to be a cruise director on your wedding day. You SHOULD be able to just relax and focus on getting ready. But in order for that to happen you should\u2019ve planned and communicated before hand better. Your team sucked (MOH mainly) and you put the entire burden on your groom. And it sounds like you did that day-of which is extra assholeish. \nI think ESH but mostly YTA", "YTA for your attitude. I feel bad for your husband. He must be a saint to still want to marry you after that", "YTA", "NTA. Your MOH had the plans idk why it was so hard", "\"All these details were provided with excruciating detail via excel sheets, floor plans, and type form including all of the details anyone would need.\r  \n\r  \nEssential info what's whatsapped and printed out as well\"  \n\n\nNTA.", "YTA\nGuests lose things and forget things.\nSo do you want them there or  not?", "YTA.  The wedding party is to celebrate with you, not set up plan and execute your wedding!  Stop trying to save money by putting your guests to work and get a wedding planner like everyone else.", "NTA. 20 people isn\u2019t huge. Your friend should have been able to handle it. How many cars could it possible be?", "[deleted]", "I just told my annoying cousins who wouldn\u2019t stop calling me to call my Mom instead \n\nI also made a very thorough website with maps to everything. And yet people still called and emailed and texted me. It\u2019s good to have a plan for that day because this does happen", "Wedding planners & coordinators people. Things don\u2019t need to be this complicated. It seems like no one was assigned to handle these tasks, that\u2019s on you.", "Honestly, NTA for not wanting to answer obvious questions. This kind of incompetence drives me nuts\u2026 especially after putting so much time and effort into planning AND ensuring everyone had the appropriate information. Slight y t a for not appointing someone to answer stupid questions for you so the groom could also enjoy his day. Emergencies happen and a MOH or wedding planner in communication is kind of necessary, but I still say NTA.", "YTA.", "You are the bride. Not the Queen of England. \nYou had a party for 20.

Your husband is a saint.", "[removed]", "Yta.", "YTA. \n\nFirst day of being socially recognized as married and your husband gets to spend the day preventing you from sabotaging your own wedding. Bahahaha.", "Her poor husband, it was his wedding day, too.", "Handed over the phone to MOH or taken a tranq. This sounds like the most strictly regimented wedding ever.", "THIS. Thank you. These y t a comments are making me feel crazy. \n\nAnd it is fairly common in the states to have a paid wedding planner, but not essential. A day-of coordinator (i.e. a friend, MOH, mother, whatever) is more than sufficient. It\u2019s definitely not too much to ask a MOH to field stupid questions or know where the damn venue is.", "Congratulations OP. Your first day of being socially recognized as married and your husband gets to spend the it preventing you from sabotaging your own wedding. Lmfao.\n\nYTA.", "Aye, I did do this to myself", "My reasoning for being annoyed at the time.", "Main character syndrome energy tbh", "Yes it is definitely his day as much as mine. That's why I valued his input during the planning of the event.\nAfter the first few questions I realised how it would go down and if he didn't pick up those calls, she would have definitely been okay. MOH was capable.\nIn the end, he loved the day and we both thanked her for everything.", "Digital invites were sent to mobile phones.\nI didn't waste money on paper invites because of this.

And I picked a restaurant that was as close (and nice) to the town hall as possible", "My MOH was the one with questions.\nAnd when it came to guests wanting transport to restaurant they asked in person so it was handled straight away.\n\nEvery question my MOH asked on that day was already accounted for in doc which I also printed out to keep close (the same doc of essential info was also whatsapped in case the paper was damaged )", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Not that your husband doesnt also have the right to get ready and not answer unnecessary questions.

She could have hired a friend, sister, niece, anyone to take care of everything if she didn\u2019t want to or made sure her MOH handled it. Leaving it to her husband to be stressed was wrong. Just because the party is small doesn\u2019t mean everyone wasn\u2019t stressed about when and where to be. Stress tends to make people frazzled and frazzled people don\u2019t think straight. She knew beforehand she wasn\u2019t going to deal with any phone calls and should have planned accordingly. Not leaving her husband high and dry to deal with the stress. He deserved to enjoy the day stress free too. It all boils down to her lack of planning ahead.

I read this in her voice because this is nearly verbatim how she summed it up.

Sounds like yeah, MOH dropped the ball, but we don't have nearly enough info to know if you could have guessed that ahead of time.\n\nMy SIL offered to run the kitchen at our wedding (we were doing our own food).  I am very laid back and kept telling I don't care which end of the table the sandwich rolls vs the veggie tray goes.  But she kept stressing SOOOOOO much. Literally I had only 2 requests: cake and drinks go on 2 separate tables away from everything else, and pull the giant bags of frozen fruit out of the freezer at least an hour before.  I always get disappointed when other people don't and I bite into a strawberry or peach slice and it's still frozen.\n\nShe succeeded in food and drink placement, but literally the only other thing I asked for she failed to do.  Pulled it out just beforehand.  Whatever.  I cannot manage the fruit temperature in my wedding day.  That's no longer my job.", "I genuinely don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting downvoted or criticized for this. This would enrage me.

Her eagerness every step of the way would put me at ease when I questioned if she's okay. Hence not dropping everything on her.\nIt's at a restaurant so there wasn't much to do and the amount of tables we needed was already set in our area. \nI was pretty laid back as well and the whole event was low key. For me, if someone says they can do something I expect that of them. \nSame for me, if I offered I would do everything I said I would.\nI wouldn't call a bride or groom unless it was a dire emergency", "And had apparently already been there once before!", "It honestly makes zero sense to me that these guests were calling the bride/groom for something like ubering to the venue.
