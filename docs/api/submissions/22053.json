Yes,  you're the bride, and no, you shouldn't have to deal with these problems. But in order to make this decision, you need to appoint someone to answer those calls for you. You are hosting a huge event with (presumably) a lot of guests (probably some from out of town) that requires a ton of coordination, and you can't just go MIA and shrug off the issues 'because I'm the bride'\n\nIf you don't have a wedding planner, you should have handed your phone to your MOH", "Going with YTA. What if there was an emergency or some other issue with those items? You paid these people for a service and they want to make sure it\u2019s done properly. Let\u2019s imagine possible scenarios\u2026\n\n* a fire\n* water damage\n* gas leak\n* other maintenance issue with location\n\ni\u2019m betting you\u2019d be pissed as hell if you arrived and things weren\u2019t ready. And that would be because you couldn\u2019t answer the phone. You could have handed it to someone else or designated another person to be the contact for the day.", "Didn't you have a maid of honour to manage these things? Did you brief them before the wedding? I did, and I also provided transportation for the bridal team. If you didn't, then who else could they have asked?", "ESH because you both should have decided ahead of time who would be dealing with day of nonsense.\n\nIf neither of you wanted to deal with \u201cemergencies\u201d from guests and vendors then you either needed to  ask someone to help you and direct people to them or hire someone. This is the exact reason people have wedding coordinators.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want to stress over trivial things on the day of your wedding. However, it\u2019s also perfectly reasonable for your husband to want that same stressless experience. You both should have had this conversation well before the wedding.", "INFO The bridal team? Are these friends of yours who volunteered to help with your wedding to help you guys save money or what not? Or are they professionals?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sorta lean with the guests towards ideally there would be a person- other than the bride and groom- who would be the designated handler of guest questions. Whenever people are going from location A to location B there are going to be questions, but I sorta feel like you shouldn't bother the bride and groom with that sorta thing.", "Did...you appint anyone to handle your phone on the day? Because that's the bare minimum you need to do to avoid being the AH. People know your phone number, that's the number they're going to call for any query on the day (your husband's too). If you're not taking ~~cake~~calls (and you shouldn't be on your big day) then you NEED that phone to be manned by someone close enough to know the answers and not have to disturb you on the day.\n\nBased on your post, I'm saying YTA.", "It\u2019s not that you\u2019re an asshole for wanting peace on your day, but YTA for the way you handled it. All you had to do was assign a bridesmaid, trusted friend, wedding coordinator, relative, etc. to help out with answering the phone. But saying you won\u2019t answer because you\u2019re the bride and saying you won\u2019t \u201cspoon feed\u201d people just makes you sound rude and snobby. I\u2019d apologize at least for the way you said it. But I do agree there\u2019s no reason for you to be repeating yourself and answering previously answered questions on your day.", "NTA its not uncommon for the bride AND groom to leave there phones other places so they can just enjoy each other and there special day. you not picking up your phone does not make you the ah here especially if you gave clear instructions to everyone.", "NTA at all!! On my wedding day my phone me and my husband left our phones in a completely different room so that we could just live in the moment! People should respect any rules that the couple sets.", "NTA.\n\nI don't answer my phone because I'm at work. Not answering your phone on your big day to provide information you've already given is pretty reasonable.\n\nGranted, I probably would've delegated that responsibility to someone instead of just outright ignoring it; but my opinion stands.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding of course you\u2019re not going to be glued to your phone, sorting out peoples problems because they were to lazy to sort it out themselves in advance! Who the hell thinks it\u2019s appropriate to bother the bride/groom with taxi problems?!", "YTA, you\u2019re the bride but you\u2019re the party host. Therefore, it is your responsibility to make sure these things are attended to unless you delegated another person (I.e MOH) to handle these calls.", "Uh YTA for not figuring out the transport, or making it clear that it needed ro be figured out by someone other than you, and sharing it in your excel documents that were so meticulously thought out beforehand", "NTA. It's your wedding day.", "DUH, NTA.", "YTA. \n\nThis was a situation where you could be stubborn, or you could have things go right.  You chose to be stubborn. \n\nThings are going to happen.  Last minute questions come up.  There needs to be someone designated to make these decisions and answer questions.  Based on your tone, I also have a feeling that you wouldn't want someone else making decisions for you.  \n\nThis is why, if you feel that strongly, you shell out money for a day of coordinator to be the contact for this stuff.", "If you're not willing to help your wedding go smoothly and any hick ups occur that you could have prevented that's all on you. Ole Grand Queen of Sheba all must bow before you praise your glorious beauty. \n\nYTA", "NTA, a wedding of 20 people, MoH didn't seem to have a grasp on things, but when wedding and reception are 10 min drive apart, at no time on the wedding day, should a bride and groom be expected to organize anyone. Grown ass adults should have the common sense (yes, I know there is nothing common about common sense) to ask someone else, like one of the other guest or heaven forbid, Google. \"Hey Ciri, how do I get to X\"  \nThe fact that this was all laid out already makes it worse.  \nAlso, once the wedding day has started, if a few tables don't have flowers or something isn't exactly set as planed, there is not much point getting stressed.  \nThe things I've seen people bother the bride and groom about over the years is mind boggling. \"hey bride, can you ask the bar if they have X?\" Hey bride, did you know that 2 tables in back are missing some of the flowers?\" Hey groom, do you know if the DJ/Band will play X\"?", "NTA. I didn\u2019t even have to read this one (I did anyway). \n\nAll of the planning, money, stress, decision making etc. was done in the lead-up to the wedding day. On the actual day of the wedding that\u2019s no longer your responsibility. That\u2019s literally groomsmen and bridesmaids job", "YTA a bit.  This could have been discussed in advance.  \n\nAt our wedding,  I asked some of my relatives and my MOH to introduce themselves to the staff and be the point of contact in case of any questionsor problems. One was the go-to person for the photographer,  one for the music,  one for catering,  one for wine/ other drinks.  I did so well before the wedding. \nI shared all the info they needed beforehand and went through it with them so they would know what to expect.", "YTA. Did you want a venue or guests, or did you not care if nobody showed up and nothing was ready? Your excruciating details didn't make it to a lot of people. Something went wrong.", "YTA. You\u2019re mad that you have to be bothered with making sure it goes the way you want, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have just as much of a tantrum if it wasn\u2019t exactly as you wanted because you couldn\u2019t be bothered to answer your phone. If you don\u2019t want to be bothered, spend the money and hire a professional wedding planner. Your friends are likely not professional wedding planners.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However bridal party were asking about table seating arrangements which was all labelled out in an excel sheet.\nFood order was also shared in advance for this wedding of 20.\nEven after sharing printed plans, mistakes were made.", "Aye - I did have a maid of honour, they were involved throughout, shared all key details beforehand and told them they'd need to take a taxi to and from town hall to restaurant which they agreed upon.\nI went over the top with details including pictures, parking space, road access, bus routes, diff taxi options. \nTo those who had cars, I included nearby parking options when sharing the wedding day invites.", "Two people were part of my bridal team.\nAnd aye, friends of mine who volunteered and wanted to help.\nAnd it was a very small wedding of 20 people altogether", "Just want to chime in that OP should in fact have cake on her wedding day lol", "I did not, and something I should have done reading the comments. My only defence was that it was a small party of 20 people at a restaurant which I thought my MOH could handle. She was the one with all the questions.\nI was just annoyed guests asked me how to get to the venue when I told them in advance if you don't have a car book a taxi.\nIt was 10 mins away by car.", "OP says that the MOH was in charge of the questions and it was a wedding of 20 people.", "But in her comments she says she did.  She had excel sheets of the address and time for the venue, parking access nearby, taxi phone numbers, table seatings, cake location , etc.   sounds like she had a very incompetent MOH who could not read.  It was the MOH who was calling to clarify when all details were shared ahead of time.", "I agree - in hindsight I should have designated someone (who was not MOH)", "She did not hand her phone to either groomsmen or bridesmaids, so anyone who had any questions were left with no answers, nor would the groomsmen or bridesmaids been aware that a guest had a question to be answered.", "sounds like you picked a bad moh\u2026", "Then you either did a bad job in picking a MOH, or a bad job in explaining what you wanted. You say you had 'excruciatingly detailed instructions' but if nobody was able to follow them, there's a common denominator, and it's probably not that all of your guests are stupid", "Mistakes were made...possibly because you didn't answer your phone to catch them, nor (crucially) did you hand your phone to someone else to man on the big day?

Still, lesson learned (and I was ABOUT to say \"for next time\" \ud83d\ude48), there's always gonna be indecisive people who need instructions just-in-time and in specific at the exact moment of being presented with the situation (e.g., what exactly to do to get to the next venue and where exactly it is located and exact instructions for what to do when they arrive there).", "It was a small wedding of 20 people including bride and groom. Majority of the questions came from my maid of honour and my husband answered. \nThe guests came up directly to ask those (which was all included in invites shared directly via WhatsApp)", "Clearly op hates communicating so that's probably why", "I was called upon for the following reasons by maid of honour:\n\nWhere is the venue?

And they volunteered to help out.\nI asked if they were happy with roles before the day continuously", "You should maybe have chosen a more competent maid of honor if you weren't going to use a planner. But I think it's fine you didn't answer your phone. It's your day, if you don't want to answer the phone, don't. Where you become TA is when you say your husband shouldn't answer his, because it's also his day.", "You honestly sound extremely uptight. I wouldn't be surprised that they were just double-checking about the things like the cake location, seating arrangements and flowers on the tables just to ensure everything was right and prevent you from getting pissed off. Your comment about how it was all so well-planned and things were still done wrong shows it. If you wanted things to be done perfectly and not be bothered with any of the details on the day, you should've hired a wedding planner instead of foisting it all off on your friends.", "And you told your MOH and bridesmaid if they had questions that you wouldn't answer their calls the day of? \n\nThe guests that needed directions and Ubers, were they your family or your husbands?\n\nDid you tell your husband answer the calls because you didn't want to? Or did he do that of his own volition and was also free to ignore the calls?", ">You should maybe have chosen a more competent maid of honor if you weren't going to use a planner. \n\nThat about sums it up.", "I work in the wedding industry and OP doesn't sound uptight to me. It sounds like the people helping them don't like reading. They would rather someone tell them again versus reading what they have to do, even after being told what to do previously. I've had to deal with these people and it's usually a nightmare."]}
