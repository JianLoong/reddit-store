My bedroom is medium sized  and fits a two metre wardrobe. Recently, I got a desk in the room since I\u2019ll be needing it to study for school, so my sister and I had to stack our two single beds on top of each other to have one bunk bed with me sleeping at the bottom. (This is just background info for later)\n\nYesterday I saw her making a grilled cheese sandwich, and warned her that it wasn\u2019t good for her lactose intolerance, she has severe lactose intolerance which causes her to break out and start puking as well. But she shrugged it off and said that she\u2019d be fine. \n\nLater on in the night she started to get a stomach ache and while she wasn\u2019t puking, she kept farting these putrid  farts and also kept burping. I told her to leave the room and go to the loo to do what she needed to do but she ignored me. That night, the wether was quite hot so my room was very humid and stuffy so her farting was literally causing my stomach to ache. So instead of asking her to leave the room (which I had already done twice before) I opened the window to allow some fresh air to come in. At this, she starting yelling for my dad that I was opening the window (she was recovering from a cold) and my dad asked me to close it. When I explained to him the situation, he told me that I was being a drama queen and that I needed to stop being selfish.\n\nFor more context I am a very smell sensitive person and even smells such as air or car freshener, diffusers, candles, body washes also causes me to have a headache and nausea. So I got very angry at her and started screaming at her that she was allergic to cheese so she needed to stop eating it along with yelling at her to get out of the room. \n\nEveryone in my family said that I b,ew it out of proportion and that I\u2019m being too dramatic, my sister said that I was being controlling and manipulative and that I was an asshole. I personally felt very frustrated and extremely annoyed at her for not being understanding at all. So, am I the asshole??", "created_utc": 1690846881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15evxh6/aita_for_shouting_at_my_lactose_intolerant_little/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also lactose intolerant. Also love cheese. Lactaid pills my dear, they\u2019ll help you both!", "Nta. If you did not share a room this would be none of your business but you warned her as she was doing it, you asked her to leave the room . Dad should have asked what the situation was before yelling at you about the window", "NTA.  It's hard for her to handle her restrictions. It's hard to deal with this. But you are not the AH. You tried to open a window and was called a drama queen??? No.", "Cheese is proven to be addictive. Just get the poor girl some lactaid tablets so you can save your nose hairs", "NTA: They didn't even let you open a window? But you should see if you can do some odd jobs or babysitting so you can afford a loft bed. That way you would have a desk and no one over you.", "The answer is Lactaid. It's cheap and non-prescription. Buy that shit.", "NTA. I\u2019m still stuck on why you can\u2019t open a window? What does getting over a cold have to do with windows?", "Ignoring lactose intolerance over many years can lead to colorectal cancer. Which happens to be the fastest growing cancer", "How old are you and your sister?", "Nta. Your sister\u2019s being the selfish one for eating lactose despite knowing it makes her feel and smell like shit", "It sounds like she made a sacrifice for you, bringing your desk into the room and stacking the beds.   The cost of this might be that you now smell her farts when you didn\u2019t before.\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s a different place in the house your desk could go, like the living room.   That might solve some problems.", "ESH.\n\nSounds like your sister made a sacrifice for you to have a desk and agreed to have the beds stacked. That was nice of her to do so because it sounds like she gave up the space she had for her bed so you could use it for yourself.\n\nI agree it was irresponsible to eat something that would cause her to get sick when she's sharing a space with you. But it's cheese. It's in everything. This cannot be the first time this has happened. Why this time did it annoy you so much? Plus she was pretty sick if she was burping like that. Yelling at someone who is that nauseous isn't going to win you any points with anyone. Where else was she supposed to go? You share a room.\n\nOpening the window was a good compromise, but she was a jerk about it, and tattled. Then your dad was also a jerk. Bully to her cold. If she was sick, she shouldn't be eating cheese and making herself more sick. I think the open window is the least of her worries if she's that sick. Plus I think she was doing it to be nasty to you because you were being nasty to her while she was nauseous. Nobody is kind when they're about to vomit. Nobody is kind when they're deprived of sleep either. Everyone was an asshole here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
