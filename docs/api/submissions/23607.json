That was nice of her to do so because it sounds like she gave up the space she had for her bed so you could use it for yourself.\n\nI agree it was irresponsible to eat something that would cause her to get sick when she's sharing a space with you. But it's cheese. It's in everything. This cannot be the first time this has happened. Why this time did it annoy you so much? Plus she was pretty sick if she was burping like that. Yelling at someone who is that nauseous isn't going to win you any points with anyone. Where else was she supposed to go? You share a room.\n\nOpening the window was a good compromise, but she was a jerk about it, and tattled. Then your dad was also a jerk. Bully to her cold. If she was sick, she shouldn't be eating cheese and making herself more sick. I think the open window is the least of her worries if she's that sick. Plus I think she was doing it to be nasty to you because you were being nasty to her while she was nauseous. Nobody is kind when they're about to vomit. Nobody is kind when they're deprived of sleep either. Everyone was an asshole here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is it like winter there and freezing? If it's summer, she's not gonna die because the window is open and she has a cold.\n\nNTA", "YTA. \n\nI am lactose intolerant myself and I both eat cheese and drink milk. \n\nThe thing is that lactose intolerance isn't an allergy but rather caused by your body not producing enough lactase\u2014the enzyme that breaks down regular milk\u2014to take care of it before it ferments in your guts and cause the runs. \n\nSo, you can eat dairy where the lactose has already been broken down. For example if lactase has been added to milk or we're talking about regular hard cheeses where it's done as part of the regular process. \n\nThat said, not everyone has the same degree of intolerance, so you have to find what works for you. \n\nLactose intolerance is also not the same as having a milk allergy. I would never *ever* serve someone with such an allergy any sort of dairy product, and as for someone with the most severe form of lactose intolerance, I'd only go for lactose free dairy products only and skip the ones naturally low on it. \n\nSo, long story short: \n\n* Lactose intolerant = can have dairy as long as any lactose has already been broken down. \n   * If you fuck up, they will have a bout of diarrhea, which could be bad enough to mess up their digestive system permanently but will not cause imminent death. \n* Allergic to the protein in milk = can't have any dairy at all, no matter what.\n   * If you fuck up, they run the risk of anaphylactic shock and imminent death.", "NTA your family doesn\u2019t care bc they don\u2019t have to smell shit.

And only like $10 a Walmart", "Everyone who criticized OP should have had to share the room with her sister, while OP slept elsewhere, in comfort and peace.", "Most good, aged cheese has little or no lactose. Cheese is made by the bacteria curdling it \u2014 the bacteria eat the sugars in the milk. \u201cLactose\u201d is the word for those sugars. Take a look at the list and offer your little sister a grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nUnless, as you said later, that she was allergic to cheese. A dairy allergy isn\u2019t the same thing as lactose intolerance. Which one did the doctor diagnose?\n\nhttps://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/cheese-can-eat-lactose-intolerant", "As a lactose intolerant cheese and dairy lover, I say NTA.\n\n\nLactose intolerance is not the same as a milk or dairy allergy. It just means your body doesn't produce enough or any lactase (an enzyme) to break down the lactose (a complex sugar found in dairy products) into simpler sugars that your body can use. The lactose stays in your system undigested and builds up. \n\nEventually, the bacteria in your gut begin to ferment the buildup, producing a mix of gases. If it smells like rotting veggies and garlic, that's methanethiol. The rotten egg smell? That is the hydrogen sulfide which can also be caused by the milk proteins being undigested then fermented as well.\n\nI can't stand the bloating from the gas and I really can't stand the smell myself. It'd be rude to subject a sibling to that if we share a room and then deny them the right to open the damn window.\n\nOn top of that, the pain, nausea, and permanent damage you can cause to your colon means you really shouldn't ignore the condition.\n\nIf OP's sister really likes cheese, there are options that can save her from the discomfort and future health problems and stop OP's suffering as well.\n\nLactaid is an OTC pill containing lactase that you can take right before a meal. Stores nowadays sell lactose free milk, which has to go through a few processes to remove the lactose that also make it creamier and tastier than regular milk! \n\nWhen it comes cheeses, aged options like aged cheddar contain low to zero lactose. Pressed cheeses like havarti and Muenster are also very good options. And absolutely avoid mozzarella!\n\nWhile I believe you were justified to yell at your sister for ignoring her condition (and your earlier warning) and forcing you both to suffer, maybe try some of the above solutions/alternatives.\n\nAlso, your parents are TA for ignoring this. Maybe tell them to try dealing with the smell for a night. I guarantee you won't even have a window anymore, just a hole in the wall to ensure permanent ventilation.", "Esh. Esp your parents. Has your sister ever tried the otc medication for it? Im sorry but if i was on bottom bunk (even top), i would be livid if someone did that. Its different than a little fluff here & there. I have a strong stomach & let me tell you, my grandsons step brother thought it would be hilarious (we have an hr & half drive) to eat cheese n milk. I pulled over on the interstate & had to get out, in rush hour, gagging, cursing & heaving. Ive never smelled anything so toxic besides a colostomy bag. It was so putrid. I even threw napkins at the poor kid & told him to clean himself. They were laughing so hard they had tears & it was making him fart even more. I would get more mad (i knew he did it on purpose to be funny-ugh boys). Thankfully they found it hilarious, i did apologize though. I could imagine being under that, esp knowing she pukes too. Nope. Let them trade you spots if they think your overreacting.", "NTA\n\nHard cheese is generally pretty low in lactose so it's quite possible that your sister has a cow's milk protein intolerance rather than a lactose intolerance.   Avoidance and treatment is exactly the same as it's dairy that contains both those things.\n\nHowever her offensive flatulence is not acceptable to expose others when it's self inflicted by her.\n\nPerhaps your father would like to keep the both of you company when your sister does this.  He needs to be exposed to the smell himself.  Or perhaps your sister can start off sleeping your parents bed till she stops farting for the night and they can deal with the rankness they find in their bed when the covers are pulled back.\n\nWhat options are there for you to be elsewhere when your sister does this?  Would staying out on the lounge be acceptable to your parents... they may not be able to watch tv there and can retire to their bedroom.  A tent in the backyard would be preferable for that smell.  Would it be a punishment for you to sleep there?  Or would it be better for your sister to be there as the smell will be dispersed better with the air.  The thing to be careful of here is that you don't want to reward your sister a room to herself by you not being there...... so really it should be her that's banished to the lounge to sleep.\n\nAnother option is for your parents to stop buying dairy to have in the house for a while... or not buying the dairy your sister likes to eat.  They are enabling her... but it gets hard if there are others that eat it... but it may be better to go without to prove a point.\n\nI would want to prove a point by doing something your sister doesn't like but you are fine with.  It could be a smell or a noise or just having a light on that stops her from sleeping.  This can be taught as a lesson in compromise and what's annoying for someone else is not okay to do.\n\nHow old are you?", "People throwing words like controlling and manipulative around so much I\u2019m very sceptical when I hear them crying.

Presumably it gets colder when the windows are open.", "Can confirm. I\u2019m also lactose-intolerant and learning that I could ask pizza places to skip the mozzarella and use the Parmesan-Romano blend instead was a life-changer!\n\nAlso: frozen yogurt is generally safe, as the bacteria in yogurt also helps break the lactose down. Anything that involves heat helps as well.", "This entire response is a big case of \"Good for you, who the hell cares, none of it is relevant to this situation.\"", "They are amazing.. my daughter is severely lactose intolerant (I'm English, so buy them in Holland and barrett).. and she can eat whatever she wants with them.", "Yeah, properly aged hard cheeses don't have any lactose at all.

And because of this I've been told that I don't know my own intolerance. It's very much relevant to this (my) situation, however, since I can simply buy lactose-free dairy and otherwise go about my day while people allergic to milk can't. \n\nEdit: Come to think of it, do *you* know the difference between being allergic to milk versus being lactose intolerant? Doesn't sound like it... \n\nOh and I will not ever serve someone allergic to milk dairy.
