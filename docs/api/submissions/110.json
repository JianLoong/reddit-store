I turned off my light and went to bed, but at that point they were being much more aggressive. Eventually they were full on screaming at eachother, I heard some loud bangs and I got super scared. I was worried that one of the kids would wake up and they wouldn't be able to properly handle the situation because they were mad. I called my mom and told her what was happening and she and my dad immediately came to our house (they were about 30 mins out of town). My parents came and my dad checked it out while my mom came up to me. Ever since then the relationship with my Aunt and Uncle has been kinda weird and I am terrified to be in the same room alone with either of them.

You did the right thing mate and if your Aunt/Uncle make you feel bad about doing it, that says more about them than it ever could about you.", "NTA. Domestic Violence is a real thing and who knows what could\u2019ve happened. You were well within your rights.", "You\u2019re a child, you didn\u2019t feel safe, you called your parents. NTA.", "Forgot to mention that my Aunt has talked to me as well and is mad that I overslept the next day because i couldn't sleep for hours. She also said that it was rude of me to talk to my parents about what I heard be cause it was a private matter and I should have just gone to sleep.", "NTA when your gut tells you that you are not safe listen to it, it will serve you well. Tell your parents what aunt & uncle have said to you since. That when they should be mortified and apologetic they instead blamed you, a child. I do wonder how their own kids cope with this environment. Do your best not to be around them if you can help it, definitely don\u2019t stay there again.", "NTA and you did the right thing. You didn\u2019t feel safe and you called your parents for help. Your aunt and uncle probably feel very awkward, as they should. They are the adults and should have handled it differently.", "NTA, but your aunt and uncle sure are. You made the best choice you could, adults need to protect the kids in their life. This is not your fault, if you need to talk to someone please tell your parents or guidance counselor at school. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.", "Nta. Your safety is paramount. \nThey\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t call the police instead.", "NTA, actual screaming and banging, supposedly caring for kids? Nope.", "When I was a kid, I lived with my father and stepmother.  My father was in the army, so we moved around a bit.  My father had untreated mental health issues, and they got worse during the three years we lived in Germany.  It was common to be woken up at 2 or 3 AM because my father was yelling and screaming at my stepmother; sometimes it escalated into physical violence.  Once, it was bad enough that my stepbrother called a friend because he was scared.  The friends mother came over to check on things.  I was worried my father was going to go after her, too. \n\nSo, having gone through something similar, I can confidently say you are not the asshole.  Your aunt and uncle are the assholes for subjecting their children and you to that sort of behavior.  It sounds like you were worried and didn't feel safe, so you reached out for help.  \n\nThat is something to be proud of.  You were in a horrible situation.  You were able to think clearly enough to realize you needed help and you figured out whom to reach out to.  \n\nHopefully it'll be a 'warning shot' to your aunt and uncle, letting them know they need to keep their issues in check.  Let things be awkward and weird.  They need to understand that their actions and behavior can  be very harmful to their children and to you.  You can't tell them that because they probably won't listen.  But the awkwardness just might drive home the point, if only slightly", "NTA. You didn't feel safe.

Well done.Your parents came immediately - took your concerns serious. Well done them too!\n\nI have read your answers - you may want to ask your parents to tell these alleged adults that they are MAJOR AH\\`s for a)projecting their failure to provide safety onto you, and b) blaming you for listening in (dunno, they could try \"not screaming\" instead - they FORCED you to listen! - and c) for NOT taking responsibility for their actions, but make you a guardian of their emotions - that is NOT okay!\n\nBut - please, NEVER feel like you are wrong here - because you AND your parents did exactly the right thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If you didn't feel safe then you were scared. You were NOT listening in if they were screaming ffs. You are a child and they need to not act this way or your parents should tell them to back off. \n\nMy parents got into screaming matches when I was a child and one time I heard a thump and I was terrified and I screamed back that they were scari g me.

They have normalized this behavior. I feel for your cousins. You did the best thing, finding your adults to get to safety.

Nothing.   \nYour uncle is mad at you because, what? Your ears work? Sorry, but no, eavesdropping is trying to listen to a conversation people are trying to keep private. Overhearing an argument is not the same thing. And, sadly, their kids are probably so used to the fighting that they tune it out, but I can guarantee they wish they didn't have to do that. You did NOTHING wrong. I'm glad your parents came back for you.", "I grew up in a family where shouting when there were arguments were part of life. Things were never physical nor violent though.

OP is NTA.", "Then my advice stands, tell your parents what they\u2019ve said since and that you still feel uncomfortable.

That sucks.", "Nope. No interest in arguing with someone whining about a post from a child looking for input on something being \"boring\". Your opinion or \"arguments\" couldn't possibly mean less to me."]}
