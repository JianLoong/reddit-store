Years of sympathy and people willing to listen and help turns into a constant desire for this type of attention. You are now 25 years of age, working, in a relationship, living in your own place and managing your chronic illness and your mom is still leaning into being a victim of circumstance. You're NTA, your mother, father and aunt however are and they need to stop fuelling your mother's need for constant recognition. You did the right thing, keep doing it until they get it.", "Woooooow... tell me your mom wants attention without telling me your mom wants attention.\nHoly f*ck it's so blatantly obvious she just wants to look good for everyone and make them pity her. It's working too because the rest of your family believes her and belittles your feelings.\nNTA, no question about it.", "NTA.\nSHE'S overwhelmed with your illness? What a load of unfettered, self-absorbed nonsense.\nIt sounds a lot like your mother has a martyr complex and it's really kind of gross. \n\nYou didn't overreact, imo. You reacted appropriately to someone trying to score sympathy votes on an illness they do not suffer with. \n\nYour aunt and father may agree that you were overreacting but that's likely down to their enabling said behaviour and expecting you to, too.

You did right by yourself, good for you! \n\nOooonly thing I disagree with is that she's not dealing with the illness at all. She gave birth to you and obviously looked after you with your illness for a long time so while she might not deal with it anymore on a day to day basis, she has had to deal with it so she might truly be overwhelmed by it. It wouldn't be \"so out there\" if she has been carrying trauma related to it too.
