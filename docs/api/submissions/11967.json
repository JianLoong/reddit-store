She asked if I knew she was going to be there when i booked it and i said yes, initially we were going to stay at the same hotel but i booked something different and for a different date because we didn\u2019t want to end up on holiday with someone we see all the time at home as it wouldn\u2019t feel like we were getting away from our normal lives as such. She thought this was odd and i explained that I\u2019m going for a break from the norm and like to have that time to ourselves as a family. \n\nSince then she has been hinting that she wants to go on holiday but not on her own with her kid and joked that she might book to go away the same time as us.\n\nToday she has text me and asked me what dates I\u2019m going on holiday and which hotel, i have told her I\u2019m not telling her and she has left me on read \ud83d\ude05 she will definitely have seen her bum over it but I don\u2019t want her tagging along our first family holiday, we wouldn\u2019t rule out a holiday with extended family that was initially planned that way but i don\u2019t think you should just invite yourself along.\n\nSo, am i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1678452938, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11noguz/aita_for_refusing_to_tell_my_cousin_where_i_am/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
