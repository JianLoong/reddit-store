Do you spend the other half of the week at your partner's place? No? didn't think so.\n\nYou and your room mate need to sit down and discuss appropriate boundaries for SOs, not just this particular situation but hypothetical future situations too. Not just how much time your partner can spend in the shared home and what compensation is due, but what behaviours are acceptable, food and other provisions sharing/stealing, utilities use/over-use, supervision or lack of host presence and what the room mate in the relationship is required to do in terms of defending the boundaries on behalf of the other room mate. All agreements need to be binding for both of you and your partners, so be careful what you argue for. And, no, your partner doesn't get to be part of this conversation.\n\nYour room mate signed up to co-habit with 1 person not 2, this isn't fair behaviour on your part, I don't care how \"helpful\" you think your partner is or how much you think he \"stays out of the way\". This is not the original deal, and you're the one who broke it.\n\nApologize and then have the adult conversation.", "You are arguing back with the overwhelming response that YTA.  I get it, you love your partner, want them to stay over and think your (paying) roommate is wrong but objectively, they are not.

Having been in shared living situations for 10+ years now, I\u2019ve been on both sides of this. \n\nWhat\u2019s often not obvious when you\u2019re caught up in the throes of a new \u201cserious\u201d relationship, is that this person is a perfect stranger to the other cohabitant(s). Especially in a 2b flat, it\u2019s easy for the single person to suddenly feel like a third wheel or otherwise imposition on your relationship cloud-nine, which is a horrible thing to feel in your own home. This COMPLETELY changes the dynamic of the flat, and the least you and your partner can do is compensate them for their home being totally invaded. \n\nI want to crawl into a hole when I think about doing what you\u2019ve done in the past. You see your new relationship as the centre of the universe and expect everyone to be as happy and accommodating to it as you are. If you\u2019re this serious about the relationship, do yourself a favour and find an apartment together - it will still be a net savings as you both are paying rent on two separate units, and the other person can resume living in peace.", "YTA... utilities increase when you add another person staying over half the week.

They are using common areas, bathrooms, kitchen (your partner making the effort to staying out of my room mates way is not the same as them not being there) and I assume the utilities have gone up. \n\nWhat you should do is to try to agree in a split that sounds fair to all parties. 50-50 is not fair if you moved another person in, and 33-33-33 is not fair as two of you share a room. Somewhere in the neigbourhood of 60-40 sounds reasonable. You and your partner pay 30 percent each of the total rent, and your roommate would pay 40 percent. Of course, you can split the 60 percent any way you want with your partner. As they are they half the time and have other lodgings, you can decide to pay 45 percent, them 15 percent for example.", "INFO: Does the leaseholder ask for help in cleaning?

And you seem really hung up on \"my BF would only be helping reduce my roommate's rent, not mine.\" That's something for you and your BF to negotiate. How you and your BF split the cost is your problem, not your roommate's.\n\nI suggest using a rent calculator web site like [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/calculators/rent) to come up with something that seems fair to both you and your roommate. Do those negotiations on behalf of both you and your BF.\n\nThen, separately negotiate with your boyfriend on how to split costs between the two of you.\n\nIf your roommate is using more of the common areas, then your rent split might already be fair.

This was definitely not acceptable then\u2026 someone really should have tried to protect your sister", "He should think even more about if his daughter now had a 2 year old with a 9 year older man...", "(Btw, just to add, I don\u2019t mean you, you were only just a kid yourself. But the adults around really should have done more in this situation)", "Thank you, I agree it\u2019s a good quote for the situation. \n\nI tried so hard to get my sister to see sense, my BIL was violent towards me and my parents when I tried to stop the relationship. He was violent to most people but was besotted with my sister. \n\nMy parents tried everything to stop my sister from seeing my BIL but no one - including authorities cared. There\u2019s a lot more to this story that I ever intended sharing.\n\nMy sister had her kids and showed her true colours and stole hundreds of thousands from her employer, our dying parents and her husband parents. She used the kids to stay out of trouble and blackmail everyone. \n\nI am so resentful every day, I\u2019m in therapy but my hatred ends up seeping into everything - as you can see by this comment. \n\nThat quote hit me hard because I tried hard to stick up for my sister in the past but she let me down constantly. I painted her out to be a victim in my post, we haven\u2019t spoken in years now.\n\nThank you for taking the time to reply and to give me something to think about!", "I'm truly sorry you have had to endure this.  We can only do so much for our family until we can do nothing more. It's kinda like that with my sister (7 years older than me). Not as extreme, but somewhere down the line we just stopped being siblings. \n\nI still remember those days we were close and she'd take care of me when I was little, and spend time with me. She turned into a very toxic person into adulthood and nothing I do can change it since she's in her 40s and set in her ways by now."]}
