Do you spend the other half of the week at your partner's place? No? didn't think so.\n\nYou and your room mate need to sit down and discuss appropriate boundaries for SOs, not just this particular situation but hypothetical future situations too. Not just how much time your partner can spend in the shared home and what compensation is due, but what behaviours are acceptable, food and other provisions sharing/stealing, utilities use/over-use, supervision or lack of host presence and what the room mate in the relationship is required to do in terms of defending the boundaries on behalf of the other room mate. All agreements need to be binding for both of you and your partners, so be careful what you argue for. And, no, your partner doesn't get to be part of this conversation.\n\nYour room mate signed up to co-habit with 1 person not 2, this isn't fair behaviour on your part, I don't care how \"helpful\" you think your partner is or how much you think he \"stays out of the way\". This is not the original deal, and you're the one who broke it.\n\nApologize and then have the adult conversation.", "You are arguing back with the overwhelming response that YTA.  I get it, you love your partner, want them to stay over and think your (paying) roommate is wrong but objectively, they are not.  You moved in someone else who is unwelcome and are refusing to acknowledge this, instead flipping the script to make it sound like the paying roommate is somehow wrong for living in their own apartment.  \n\nMove out, get a place with your partner.  YTA.", "YTA:I\u2019m just saying if he is staying there for literally half the week he can help with the rent sorry not sorry I do understand why your roommate is upset and be paying the rent.", "YTA. Having been in shared living situations for 10+ years now, I\u2019ve been on both sides of this. \n\nWhat\u2019s often not obvious when you\u2019re caught up in the throes of a new \u201cserious\u201d relationship, is that this person is a perfect stranger to the other cohabitant(s). Especially in a 2b flat, it\u2019s easy for the single person to suddenly feel like a third wheel or otherwise imposition on your relationship cloud-nine, which is a horrible thing to feel in your own home. This COMPLETELY changes the dynamic of the flat, and the least you and your partner can do is compensate them for their home being totally invaded. \n\nI want to crawl into a hole when I think about doing what you\u2019ve done in the past. You see your new relationship as the centre of the universe and expect everyone to be as happy and accommodating to it as you are. If you\u2019re this serious about the relationship, do yourself a favour and find an apartment together - it will still be a net savings as you both are paying rent on two separate units, and the other person can resume living in peace.", "YTA... utilities increase when you add another person staying over half the week. Does your boyfriend have a key? Is he spending time there when you are not home? Did you have a discussion with the roommate before he started living there part time?", "YTA. 3-4 days is a lot. Your roommate doesn't want a third roommate. It's not a money grab, it's about being fair. The common areas are now used by 3 people, not 2. Don't know if paying more rent is the answer but you guys do need to come together and compromise. Maybe your roommate will ask you if your partner can come over like 1-2 times/week instead of 3-4, and that's fair for him to ask. If you don't like it, and can't come to a compromise, the best thing to do would be to find a different housing arrangement that works well for you and your partner.", "Sorry but YTA here. You pretty much moved a third roommate in with out considering how it will affect your current roommate or it sounds like even asking them in the first place. I would also inform you that you either have to move or pay more. Furthermore this is standard practice.

Your roommate agreed to live with you and you are the one who decided to throw a third person into the mix. He did not choose that person and does not have to live with them half the time if he does not want to. If he is okay with them staying, he has every right to demand your partner to pay rent. They are using common areas, bathrooms, kitchen (your partner making the effort to staying out of my room mates way is not the same as them not being there) and I assume the utilities have gone up. \n\nWhat you should do is to try to agree in a split that sounds fair to all parties. 50-50 is not fair if you moved another person in, and 33-33-33 is not fair as two of you share a room. Somewhere in the neigbourhood of 60-40 sounds reasonable. You and your partner pay 30 percent each of the total rent, and your roommate would pay 40 percent. Of course, you can split the 60 percent any way you want with your partner. As they are they half the time and have other lodgings, you can decide to pay 45 percent, them 15 percent for example.", "INFO: Does the leaseholder ask for help in cleaning? Does your partner pay rent elsewhere?", "Do you split the utility bills? Then yes, he should be paying some rent.

Then he's being inconvenienced there, too.", "YTA", "YTA those aren\u2019t concrete benefits. The only way this would be okay is it you were staying at their house the exact same amount - thus cutting down on energy and bills.\n\nYour flatmate has less room in the apartment and higher utility bills.

And you seem really hung up on \"my BF would only be helping reduce my roommate's rent, not mine.\" That's something for you and your BF to negotiate. How you and your BF split the cost is your problem, not your roommate's.\n\nI suggest using a rent calculator web site like [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/calculators/rent) to come up with something that seems fair to both you and your roommate. Do those negotiations on behalf of both you and your BF.\n\nThen, separately negotiate with your boyfriend on how to split costs between the two of you.\n\nIf your roommate is using more of the common areas, then your rent split might already be fair. Using Splitwise or something similar will help you have that discussion with your roommate.", "YTA why would she appreciate a random man in her space?", "YTA at the very least he needs to be contributing to utilities!
