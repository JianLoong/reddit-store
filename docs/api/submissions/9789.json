Someone you care about was in a serious accident, and you\u2019re going to talk about what you would do about inheritance in the event that he dies? \n\nThat\u2019s not sticking up for yourself, that\u2019s not sticking up for your husband, that\u2019s morbid and kind of cruel. BIL shouldn\u2019t have blocked your entry, but this was a truly bizarre thing to say and it\u2019s kind of a no brainer that his family was seriously off-put by it.", "Why are so many people using throwaway accounts to post on this sub?", "NTA I wish my IL's would play with me like that im going to jail", "NTA\n\nYou were getting desperate to see your husband who was being kept away from you.", "NTA. But your BIL is.", "This is another case of missing information. It was a really awful situation for everyone. Why would a family member stop a spouse from seeing their majorly injured spouse? What prompted OP to say something so awful? OP needs to decide if these relationships can be corrected or cut. ESH", "NTA", "INFO- were you separated when he was staying with family? Was this a planned visit?", "ESH- How do you expected they to take? You are \"having problems\" with your husband for a year and the first thing that comes to your mind when you are antagonized by your BIL inheritance? And you are surprised they took the wrong way? You jokes about their son/brother's death, and they probably heard ALL about your \"problems\" from your husband. You could have said anything else or wait for your husband wake up and Tell him everything sonhe dealt with his family but what you said would left me with a bad taste...", "*He was also implying the accident was my fault.*  \n\n\nHow does this dude think she caused an accident from a plane ride away?", "NTA. Talk to your husband about his emergency contact information. I would even consult an attorney. You need to ensure the YOU are the one contacted if there\u2019s a problem since you cannot rely on his family to show even the smallest modicum of decency. Your marital issues of absolutely none of their business given that your husband was asking for you. Frankly, you shouldn\u2019t give the tiniest of fucks how your BIL interpreted your words. Get your affairs in order so that you never need to deal with him again. The rest of your husband\u2019s family is either willing to listen or they aren\u2019t, but that\u2019s not a concern right now. Focus on your husband\u2019s recovery and see to that paperwork.", "NTA \n\nIt was said in the heat of the moment when his family was blocking you from seeing your husband!

You pulled out the power card. They didn't misinterpret your words. They are cold with you because now they know what they should expect from you should the worst happen to your husband. And they've chosen not to suck up to you but to distance themselves from you even further. I don't know what marital issues you & your husband are having that is so serious you are no longer listed as your husband's emergency contact. But you just made it a lot worse unnecessarily.

Or split with him and your husband?", "Yta purely for bringing up death while he was fresh out of the hospital that is beyond insensitive", "ESH, except maybe your husband who was unconscious most of the time.", "NTA- I'd have said a lot more to that BIL than you did.\n\nGo to an experienced local lawyer and find out if your in-laws have done anything illegal in failing to provide your contact info as next of kin so that medics could notify you while your husband was in hospital. They may have unlawfully pretended to be your husband's next of kin or lied on the hospital paperwork. \n\nBe sure to let the lawyer know that your husband is the owner of the property that the unpleasant in-laws live in and there is a chance that they may be attempting alienation or controlling & coercive behaviour motivated by a cmbination of their own potential financial gain and animosity towards you by preventing you from seeing your unwell husband when he has asked to see you.", "INFO Did you cheat on your husband?

ESH", "I'm confused by so many things that I'm seriously thinking I may have some sort of reading disorder.\n\n1. Why would you inherit the family home if he dies?

Why would you be responsible for the accident your husband had?", "INFO: what do you mean by \u201chaving issues for over a year\u201d?\n\nThat can mean anything from, \u201cwe have stressors in our marriage that we\u2019ve been working through together\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019re a few days away from the divorce finalizing.\u201d\n\nHow long has he been visiting his family that\u2019s a plane ride away?\n\nI feel like this context is important to understand this dynamic.", "Need more context here. It\u2019s not normal for a family to want to keep the spouse away like this. Just what exactly has been happening between you and the husband that they think justifies keeping you away while he\u2019s in this kind of condition?

Their house it's in their name... so if he dies... it goes to her.", "So reddit is majority left leaning and sexist that\u2019s almost a paradox", "I mean you answered didn\u2019t you?", ">And in the event of her husband's death, when he is recovering from an extremely traumatic accident?\n\nThat the family tried to hide from her, even though she's his legal proxy by default.\n\nAnd you missed the part where they tried to keep her, the OWNER'S WIFE out of \"their\" family home, that she could only inherit if HE was the sole owner.\n\nBIL is projecting so hard that we can all see it on the moon.  All this shady, weird behaviour from the in-laws tells me that they wanted her husband to die, because they didn't realise that she would inherit instead of them.", "I think she was pointing out that she has more ownership of this home than they do, meaning they have no right to keep her out.\n\nAnd they didn't tell her that her own husband was in the hospital. He had to ask them for her. \n\nThat is unacceptable. \n\n[Disclaimer: unless she's so massively abusive that they should be protecting him from her, it just doesn't sound like there's any evidence to suggest that here.]", "Are you by chance the said knuckle brain brother-in-law who absolutely needs to be locked out in the cold in the night in the dead of winter?", "WHAT the FUCK are you TALKING ABOUT?????.", "I think you need to lay off the Porn Hub.", "Lol what are you smoking?", "No matter what the situation, there\u2019s a always a shitty dude ready to cape for another shitty dude.", "Agreed. Sounds like the family for one reason or the other doesn\u2019t like the OP.  She said they had issues that were publicly known. Did she do something to hurt the husband that the family knows? Not tryna jump to conclusions but I feel like we need more honest context to understand the tension between the OP & the Fam. Regardless using the will in the case of death of the husband as a threat/insult to the brother in law is pretty unnecessary/disrespectful. I understand you were frustrated but you can\u2019t really expect the fam to be all cool with it after. Sorry but YTA", "Something tells me him paying for an entire house for his family is one of the reasons OP is having marital problems.
