But in these particular circumstances, which is all we have to go on, that was an AH thing to say in response to AH actions from the BIL so ESH.", ">How could OP have had anything to do with her husband's accident if:\n\nI don't think she did.  Her husband's brother thought she did.", "I'm not here to debate my husband's behaviors with you. I'm only acknowledging my own experiences with men who profess to be feminists or progressive behaving in sexist ways.", "No, he didn't. He knew she had nothing to do with the accident, but he was trying to make her feel guilty about it in an attempt to make her feel as though it was somehow her fault that it happened. That's a big difference. He wasn't saying, \"You did this,\" he was saying, \"Look what he did because of you.\" Again, he was intentionally trying to make her even more upset than she already was.", "Exactly but in your own experiences it\u2019s only sexism because you m believe it to be. He doesn\u2019t so idk who\u2019s right. It could be something like saying \u201cmen on average are stronger than woman\u201d some people find that statement sexist.", "Lol you're actually mansplaining someone else's marriage to them. Hilarious.", "You\u2019re truly just outting yourself here as a sexist", "If he\u2019s able to communicate to his family that he wants to see his wife, I think he\u2019s also able to communicate to hospital staff the same thing. \n\nAgain, we\u2019re missing so much information here", "YTA. hopefully your husband will adjust his will", "INFO: expand on issues? Are you separated or just in a rough patch? Did you consider that your husband asked for you while medicated but changed his mind once lucid hence why your BIL was preventing you from entering? \n\nFYI if I found out my spouse said something like that after I almost died if I wasn't separated I soon would be.", "NTA. Hey BIL, if you\u2019re reading this, go fly a kite.", "ESH. How does it go that far left.", "ESH you were not at fault for how the family treated you! that said we as individuals control how we respond to those, you could havee bit your tongue and walked away, but you chose to fire back.", "I'm going to go with ESH simply because HOLY FUCK WHAT AN INSENSITIVE WAY TO TRY TO MAKE A POINT.", "NTA.\n\nHis family really sodding sucks... Well, that or they really don't like or respect you OP. Or both. \n\nThe only reason I can think of to not tell a spouse that there other half has been in an accident is if I would consider that spouse abusive, gold digging... Or just a general detriment to their health.\n\nYou said you have been rocky for a year, and you didn't specify how long he was in the hospital for whilst they were refusing to call you. Are you two going weeks without talking? Because if that is the case, then to a family member, you might be considered an outsider again...", "NTA, he had no right to prevent you from seeing your husband. You have more rights than he does. I get what you were saying, BIL was just too obtuse to understand it. I\u2019m sorry your husband is making a joke out of it. He should be telling his brother to FO, he asked for you. That should have been end of story.", "YTA - Forgot all the other details; telling a family member that you'll inherit ANYTHING from someone who hasn't even passed yet is obscenely and grossly insensitive.", "NTA. Glad your husband trusts you.", "NTA", "ESH, Why the hell would you say something like that in that particular situation and not expect it to go badly? \n\nLook I'm sorry your husband is hurt and for all you're going through but if your tone is always this cold I can see why his family feels protective.", "NTA, but why couldn\u2019t you get the nurse to kick them out and let you in? You\u2019re the next of kin.", "NTA\n\nYou're still married to him, so they should have let you see him. Maybe it wasn't the most appropriate thing to say, but I would have been angry as well.", "NTA, but your husband's relatives certainly are.", "Just on the basis of your question, fuck yes YTA. Them keeping him from you (and not telling you he was in the hospital) is a whole other deal and needs more info.\n\nBut yeah, telling a dude that if his brother had died you'd kick them out of the house sucks.", ">we\u2019ve been having issues for over a year \n\nInfo: what issues is this? If you are a danger to the us and he is hiding from his abusive spouse\u2026maybe there\u2019s a reason", "There\u2019s way more to the story here\u2026. Tell the rest.", "NTA", "I don't really know who's TA here, but if you wanted to give him the perfect ammunition you did that flawlessly. \n\nMentioning death and weaponing inheritance like that?\n\nI mean you might as well draw a big villain moustache on if you wanna make it that easy.", "NTA", "NTA, next time call the cops on bil, he's the ah", "NTA. How would an accident be your fault? How is it anything but an AH maneuver to not let you in the house to see him? Screw that entire family.", "NTA. Honestly if this happened to me and it was my wife in the accident, the least of their worries would be who inherited the home, and they would have to call the police because I WOULD be entering that house to check on my wife and take her to a hotel so I could care for her.", "You are your husband's legal next of kin. You should have been the one the hospital called in the first place when he was brought in. I would be finding out why you weren't notified. And if anyone in my husband's family tried to keep me away from him, I'd left and come back with a deputy to do a \"wellness check.\"", "NTA. Marriage problems or not your BIL was way out of line. I believe he was baiting you to get anything useful that he could then use to discredit you with the family.  You know, like center stage, to be the 'big man' rehashing everything you said to a captive audience. I wish you the best.", "NTA. They are doing the fake outrage thing to deflect from their own malfeasance in hiding your husband's accident. You need to be angry, and aim that anger right at them.", "Why? Would you bring that up? Is that relevant to anything at all? ESH", "YTA. Your BIL was being a jerk, but that comment isn\u2019t funny. All you should have had to say is your husband asked for you, and you\u2019ve come to see him. You could say that as his wife, you\u2019re automatically responsible for his care, even if you\u2019re having some troubles.", "NTA but in poor taste.", "Are you in your husband's will to get the house if he dies? Depending on what your local inheritance laws are, that's not a given.\n\nAlso, ESH.", "You have to say NTA or it won't count.", "This. Holy shit. NTA.", "Give me a fucking. Break. AITA is so slanted towards women it\u2019s staggering. You\u2019re being ridiculous.

Or, perhaps, OP\u2019s husband ODed and they blamed OP for getting him on drugs or enabling his drug use.\n\nThis is an INFO to me.  The family sounds like a deranged set of assholes, and that\u2019s quite possibly true, but it\u2019s not certain.", "She didn't know because he's visiting his family and not near her. How could she possibly know he was in an accident in if nobody told her? Is she supposed to be psychic?", "From my understanding they were at home when the bill was refusing op entry. There would be no security.", "I mean it sounds like she did say \u201clet me see my husband\u201d a lot of times before that. She immediately flew all the way there and then he wouldn\u2019t let her in, so it\u2019s not surprising she was pissed off", "Thank you! ESH.", "When convalescing, you sleep when you can, especially in the hospital (yay rounds every three hours of needles and stats) or shortly after a hospital stay. If the husband had been *that* insistent about seeing her, he wanted to be woken up the minute she got there. Even if he was sleeping. Regardless of how rocky their relationship had been before.", "How did his mother not have right of survivorship on the home?  How did the home bypass her and get to be inherited by your husband?", "I missed that he was visiting, I thought he had moved back due to them having issues for the past year. However, she could have realized there was a problem quickly had she been in contact with him. \n\nHow long could your S.O. disappear while on a trip before you noticed his absence? Long enough to have a hospital stay?", "AITA only counts your verdict if it\u2019s in your original comment, replies to comments are not counted", "So why doesn't the mom own the house?  She's still living and, I believe, living in that very house.", "There are a lot of small issues in our marriage that have turned into a bigger thing because we didn\u2019t address them earlier and now there\u2019s a lot of resentment between us on bad days.\n\nI never cheated on him or anything like that. His family mostly dislike me because they\u2019re upset I wouldn\u2019t agree to moving to their country after my father-in-law died and because I stopped making an effort with them when things got bad between us so their image of me isn\u2019t great anymore.", "No, we live in a different country to them.", "I would have SO left and come back with a deputy, telling him that he was asking for you, and they were keeping him from seeing her. She is his legal next of kin, and she could have gone in and taken him home if she'd wanted to.", "That would be the way I approach every interaction with them from now on-I\u2019m calling the police.", "Thanks x 2", "That's the part that loses me.  If his dad dies why would the house not stay with his living spouse as a marital asset?", "The dad died and left it to OPs husband. No idea if it was the dad's property prior to marriage or the parents were divorced.", "From his parents?", "This is the answer I needed.  They\u2019re assholes.  As long as their issues with you aren\u2019t something like abuse or enabling his use of dangerous drugs, I think they were wrong for treating you this way.", "NTA.  Then they/your BIL was completely out of line.", "this is how we know you are an incel.", "Nah, two of the most sexist, manipulative men I've known were vocal leftists. One was outright abusive to his afab partner and cheated on them when they developed a severe chronic physical disorder. But hey, at least he didn't complain about the abortion they had to get because he refused to wear condoms, right? /s\n\nWe need to stop acting like having some good political ideas makes a person a saint, because black and white thinking isn't realistic and only lets awful shit fester and grow in the shades of grey. Any wise leftist will tell you they themselves still have shitty behaviors and beliefs to unlearn.", "There's nothing saying they were separated. OP mentions them having problems and her husband visiting family. We don't have any information on how long husband was gone or what issues they have been having", "Because he would have to take a flight and it\u2019s better for him to stay where he is until he\u2019s not in so much pain.

There would have to be other conditions that would move the home from the father to the son and not to the father's wife everywhere I know.", "True", "Well, I\u2019m sure the mother could have overruled him at any time and didn\u2019t, just like my mother wouldn\u2019t if I was keeping her landlord out (and she would call me to do that).  \n\nHer husband being in there from a legal perspective doesn\u2019t matter at all, like, in any way unless he was being held there.", "Actually, given he'd been asking for *his wife* and likely was given some strong painkillers while in the hospital, it's a strong argument for him being held there against his will.\n\nYou've obviously never had family issues like an adult getting married to someone the family did not like.\n\nETA: is your mother's landlord also *her daughter-in-law*? Oh, wait, OP's husband likely doesn't have anything so formal with his mother, given the house was her home before he inherited it.", "\"You think the book weighs 4 pounds. He thinks it weighs 8.
