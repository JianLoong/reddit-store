I called my husband to ask him to order because I was driving. Husband ordered and picked it up. 11 asked for his chicken and husband brings him a wing. 11 starts crying because he eats drumsticks, like every kid. Husband only ordered a wing and thigh. 11 has always eaten the same pieces (drumstick and breast to be specific). Husband got mad that I didn't tell him exactly what to order. I said if you don't know what your 11 year old eats then you don't know him.\n\nFor background we order from this place every month or so for over a decade. We each get the same things every time. Husband and I order equally. He handles the food (cooking and takeout) about 75% of the time.\n\nA little bit later I told husband that I don't want to fight but this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say he's not considerate. That all 3 of us feel like he doesn't care about us when he does this kind of stuff. I told him that 13 said \"dad always forgets the important stuff\" when he found out why 11 was crying. We all feel like he doesn't care when he forgets basic stuff about us. He dismissed me saying that doesn't mean I don't care about you. I said we feel like you don't care and you can't tell us how to feel. \n\nI've come to realize over the last year or so that my husband is inconsiderate, not just forgetful. Other examples: He will eat the kids last of a food or snack and not ask if they want it. I had a leg injury this year (in a cast and walker) and he left things in the walkway, even after I pointed out there was stuff in my way and I can't get around. He had to take care of 13's birthday cake because of my injury and didn't get candles. 13 was upset and husband got mad that no one appreciates that he got the cake. We've been together 23 years and he's never gotten me a cake, let alone put candles in it. His birthday is 6 weeks before mine. I always get him a cake or special dessert, put candles in it and sing happy birthday with the kids. \n\nSo AITA for calling my husband inconsiderate over a minor thing like messing up a food order?", "created_utc": 1700095955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w9d4o/aita_for_calling_my_husband_inconsiderate_for/", "score": 2689, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re not impaired, they are just as capable as anyone of remembering details and noticing feelings when something is important to them, they just don\u2019t think it\u2019s important when it comes to their families. They will spend decades doing the bare minimum, often resentfully, and then act shocked when their wives slowly check out and their grown kids don\u2019t call them. \n\nThe worst thing is - it\u2019s not even malicious. They\u2019re not even thinking about their families\u2019 feelings that deeply. They don\u2019t think about them at all. They just live in their own little world. They\u2019ll follow an explicit instruction (mostly), but they won\u2019t engage their critical thinking skills while they do so, and they certainly won\u2019t go beyond the scope of the instruction. They\u2019re going through the motions of being a husband and father, and they figure that\u2019s good enough. Family isn\u2019t something they\u2019re supposed to *earn*, it\u2019s just something they *have*. \n\nSometimes they snap out of it when the situation gets dire enough. Sometimes, even if that happens, it\u2019s too late.

Dad needs to do better. NTA", "NTA it sounds like you're right.", "NTA, OP.  It will not change without some kind of epiphany or wake up call\u2026 and maybe not even then.  He has a huge blind spot of entitlement. Unless he knows it has ramifications\u2026 yeah\u2026 it won\u2019t change at all.

Most restaurants actually have a system in place where orders tend to be cataloged, so it probably wouldn't have taken even 2 seconds to ask them to bring up order history.", "NTA. I think what's worse than him forgetting is that he didn't bother double checking if he was unsure. Husband and I know each other's usual orders at our favorite takeout places, but before placing the order, well usually double check. Especially after medical procedures, my husband knows I'm really sensitive. (I have extensive of medical trauma.) \n\nYour husband's reaction to his fuck up bothers me the most though. It doesn't sound like he apologized or even bothered to comfort his son who was going through a hard time. He just deflected to make it someone else's problem and went into self preservation mode. That wouldn't fly with me. You shouldn't have to ask a grown man to apologize. My 2yo knows how to do that.", "NTA. My dad was like this. It never got better, they FINALLY got divorced when I was 14(too late imo), and now we don\u2019t talk. Like ever. You\u2019re not being petty, it\u2019s not just about the chicken. But like, if he commits to therapy and working on things and you want to, maybe it will work out!", "NTA, you just said he was inconsiderate, and he has been. It's a pattern of behavior he can change. Getting an 11 yo's order wrong after a medical procedure will be a big deal to them.", "NTA. Even his sons notice. And his persistent refusal to even acknowledge it bothers me even more, because responses like him wanting to be appreciated for doing things when he did them wrong or badly is borderline DARVO.", "If this were the only incident, I\u2019d say let it go.  But this is a pattern of shitty, uncaring behavior show to you and your kids.  NTA.", "NTA.  He sounds inconsiderate all around.

He needs to grow up and become a father, not a third child.", "NTA: When it was just the chicken, I was going to say \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just forgetful or had one of those off days where their brain doesn\u2019t work\u201d (We\u2019ve all been there). From what you shared though, it\u2019s a regular problem. I\u2019d suggest giving him the same care he gives you and your sons.", "NTA and I\u2019d stop doing the things you do to be considerate of him, like making sure he has a cake on his birthday or any domestic chores you do that only benefit him (I.e. his laundry). Show him what it like to live with someone who\u2019s so inconsiderate. I\u2019m not saying do it out of revenge or to be spiteful but so he can see how it feels. Make sure to mess up his take out order too next time you pick it up.", "I hate to say it but this was one of the many issues I had with my ex-husband. He would  get mad for me not appreciating him doing half the job. Honestly it's a hallmark of narcissist. I remember he would refuse to do housework because \"I complained that what he did wasn't good enough\". I would only complain when he would do a half the job. For example when I asked for him to clean up his mess, he would just move the mess from one room to another. Or just put things in the kitchen trashcan or garbage bag and not take it outside. Those people feel you should be honored that they even attempted. Not worth wasting your breath on because they will never listen.", "NTA this is called learned helplessness and far too many guys are very good at it. They make it so it\u2019s easier for their partner to just do it themselves or insist on their partner being a manager responsible for telling them exactly what they need to do step by step. It\u2019s something that needs to be addressed sooner than later or it will never end.", "NTA- this is a clear pattern of behavior over time. When people show you who they are, believe them.", "NTA, if it was just him messing up an order I\u2019d think he just forgot but he\u2019s done this multiple times. He\u2019s showing where his priorities lie and sadly its not with his family, my husband forgets things sometimes (portion sizes for our dogs) but even then he still remembers small things that he learned when we met hell this man will pick out cooked mushrooms from a dish because I made one comment about how I didn\u2019t like the texture 4 years ago \n\nCouples counseling could help your relationship IF he steps up and can acknowledge where he\u2019s falling short but if he can\u2019t do that then you do have to think about you and your kids because seeing how your parents act can create a kids perspective on how relationships are supposed to work, I don\u2019t have kids but I fully stand by the mindset if he or she can\u2019t/won\u2019t do things to make your life easier and make you happy then their not worth it. I\u2019ve used that line with my friends and even to my own mother when she invited us to meet her then bf because he wouldn\u2019t move for her so she can go to the bathroom, if someone won\u2019t change for you then you have to make the decision to either go to counseling and have them acknowledge their issues or acknowledge that you deserve someone who will remember the small things\n\nEdit: misspelled a word", "NTA. Your husband doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself. He could be more considerate. If he wanted to, he would.", "NTA, this is why I left my long term partner about 10 years ago. Some things shouldn't need to be said or ask of someone. My friends partner will literally go get himself dessert and come back in and sit with us all, eating a bowl of ice cream to himself. Doesn't occur to him that everyone he's hosting is just sitting there like.... ummm? And then his partner, without fail, every time will say \"I guess he just knew none of us wanted any.\" He's done it for 10 years, he just doesn't think to think of anyone else but himself. It's infuriating when you're constantly having to remind someone they're not the only person to exist.", "NTA for this.

And now your kids are putting up with it too?

But I wasn't so upset because of the fries. It was because in that moment I realized my dad truly doesn't pay attention to me.", "NTA. He simply doesn\u2019t care and has made that clear to both his wife and children. That\u2019s sad.", "Info: he has been like this for all 23 years you have been together. When did you expect him to change?", "NTA, especially since your kids have noticed this independently as well. Time for therapy??", "For the food order (in isolation) I would say NAH. He may have forgotten, slipped his mind or not thought it was a big deal (and personally you should have not made a big deal about it in front of your son, sure he was in pain and wanted a drumstick but he got a wing ... it happens, a minor thing as you put it). Think about how you would have handled the situation if your husband had ordered a drumstick but they'd given him a wing ... when life gives you a lemon make lemonade.\n\nThe rest of your post and eldest sons' comments suggest that perhaps your husband is an AH in other matters though, and I'd say this is what lead to you calling him inconsiderate over a \"minor thing\". The last paragraph suggests a pattern of selfishness, and an inability to take criticism. I'd be leaning to other subtle things happen that you may not even be aware of ... perhaps look into narcissism as my mind immediately went to the subtle things my partner mentions about her ex when she was only mentioning \"little\" things he did, without realising the \"bigger\" things he did and helped explained why he did these \"little\" things.\n\nFor example, the cake story about forgetting the candles in itself is not an issue (humans sometimes forget something like the candles) but for him to be angry that no one appreciated he got the cake is them needing validation for doing something that didn't directly serve their own purpose. A healthy reaction would have been to apologise for forgetting the candles (\"Aaah my bad, I'm sorry\") then maybe redirecting \"...but we weren't going to eat them anyway, let's enjoy the yummy cake\" or finding an alternative \"I'm sure we can find something else to burn instead ... \\[evil scientist laugh\\]\".", "respectfully\u2026 it physically pained me reading that you\u2019ve been with this man 23 years and he never got you a birthday cake. this incident obviously speaks to a larger issue, and while i am so sorry you and your kids must endure this emotional neglect, it is clear this man might not ever change without some kind of wake up call.

My dad probably couldn\u2019t even tell you what I like to it. It doesn\u2019t take a lot to just pay attention to your kid. NTA\n\nEdit: read the rest of this. Sounds like my dad. I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s your situation OP. My mom struggles with the same thing with my dad and I don\u2019t know how she puts up with it.

Nothing good comes out of a discussion or argument in the heat of the moment.

I called my husband to ask him to order because I was driving. Husband ordered and picked it up. 11 asked for his chicken and husband brings him a wing. 11 starts crying because he eats drumsticks, like every kid. Husband only ordered a wing and thigh. 11 has always eaten the same pieces (drumstick and breast to be specific). Husband got mad that I didn't tell him exactly what to order. I said if you don't know what your 11 year old eats then you don't know him.\n\nFor background we order from this place every month or so for over a decade. We each get the same things every time. Husband and I order equally. He handles the food (cooking and takeout) about 75% of the time.\n\nA little bit later I told husband that I don't want to fight but this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say he's not considerate. That all 3 of us feel like he doesn't care about us when he does this kind of stuff. I told him that 13 said \"dad always forgets the important stuff\" when he found out why 11 was crying. We all feel like he doesn't care when he forgets basic stuff about us. He dismissed me saying that doesn't mean I don't care about you. I said we feel like you don't care and you can't tell us how to feel. \n\nI've come to realize over the last year or so that my husband is inconsiderate, not just forgetful. Other examples: He will eat the kids last of a food or snack and not ask if they want it. I had a leg injury this year (in a cast and walker) and he left things in the walkway, even after I pointed out there was stuff in my way and I can't get around. He had to take care of 13's birthday cake because of my injury and didn't get candles. 13 was upset and husband got mad that no one appreciates that he got the cake. We've been together 23 years and he's never gotten me a cake, let alone put candles in it. His birthday is 6 weeks before mine. I always get him a cake or special dessert, put candles in it and sing happy birthday with the kids. \n\nSo AITA for calling my husband inconsiderate over a minor thing like messing up a food order?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He apologized immediately. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t a case like that. This would require OP to be actively unkind and inconsiderate of her partner, and the father of their children, in and out of their presence, continuously. How long would it actually take him to notice, given that he takes so little notice of his family already? Sure, he\u2019d notice that little things weren\u2019t done for him, but how long until he connects all those little things together and realizes his wife isn\u2019t taking his needs into account and is habitually and constantly inconsiderate?\n\nIt\u2019s not worth it. When your partner is doing something destructive or obnoxious, you can maybe have a teaching moment (like you/nephew or I did) if it\u2019s a consistent problem, but not if it\u2019s such an all-encompassing one.

I mean, if yall want kids that's one thing but pfftt.... if you can afford to keep your place and have your space, why not? I know I'm messy and my place looks like it, but I also know how to be considerate of others and being a woman living with a man, it always falls on me why the place is in the state it's in.

I'm AuDHD, and I can be super oblivious, and super forgetful. But I know that about myself, and I acknowledge that that's my shit to work on. So I keep lists of things I know my friends like in my notes app. I have everyone's birthdays in my calender, and my phone reminds me a week before so I have time to get a card & a gift. I set reminders for big events that my friends have coming up (holidays, job interviews, etc.), so I can text them \"good luck!\" or \"have a great time!\". Sometimes my brain makes this kind of stuff hard. Sometimes I screw up - but I apologise and I do better next time.

They're conditioned from birth that if they care too much then they aren't men. It's incredibly toxic. \n\nThis also sounds like weaponised incompetence.

And that's okay, he shouldn't feel guilty for not enjoying parties and in my opinion, shouldn't be judged as uncaring because of it. \n\nThis seems like they need a professional to help them communicate and understand each other better. He might show his love differently and something as flamboyant as a party might make him uncomfortable. Some people show love in small quiet ways instead of large public gestures and that doesn't mean they don't care.
