I called my husband to ask him to order because I was driving. Husband ordered and picked it up. 11 asked for his chicken and husband brings him a wing. 11 starts crying because he eats drumsticks, like every kid. Husband only ordered a wing and thigh. 11 has always eaten the same pieces (drumstick and breast to be specific). Husband got mad that I didn't tell him exactly what to order. I said if you don't know what your 11 year old eats then you don't know him.\n\nFor background we order from this place every month or so for over a decade. We each get the same things every time. Husband and I order equally. He handles the food (cooking and takeout) about 75% of the time.\n\nA little bit later I told husband that I don't want to fight but this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say he's not considerate. That all 3 of us feel like he doesn't care about us when he does this kind of stuff. I told him that 13 said \"dad always forgets the important stuff\" when he found out why 11 was crying. We all feel like he doesn't care when he forgets basic stuff about us. He dismissed me saying that doesn't mean I don't care about you. I said we feel like you don't care and you can't tell us how to feel. \n\nI've come to realize over the last year or so that my husband is inconsiderate, not just forgetful. Other examples: He will eat the kids last of a food or snack and not ask if they want it. I had a leg injury this year (in a cast and walker) and he left things in the walkway, even after I pointed out there was stuff in my way and I can't get around. He had to take care of 13's birthday cake because of my injury and didn't get candles. 13 was upset and husband got mad that no one appreciates that he got the cake. We've been together 23 years and he's never gotten me a cake, let alone put candles in it. His birthday is 6 weeks before mine. I always get him a cake or special dessert, put candles in it and sing happy birthday with the kids. \n\nSo AITA for calling my husband inconsiderate over a minor thing like messing up a food order?", "created_utc": 1700095955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w9d4o/aita_for_calling_my_husband_inconsiderate_for/", "score": 4891, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re not impaired, they are just as capable as anyone of remembering details and noticing feelings when something is important to them, they just don\u2019t think it\u2019s important when it comes to their families. They will spend decades doing the bare minimum, often resentfully, and then act shocked when their wives slowly check out and their grown kids don\u2019t call them. \n\nThe worst thing is - it\u2019s not even malicious. They\u2019re not even thinking about their families\u2019 feelings that deeply. They don\u2019t think about them at all. They just live in their own little world. They\u2019ll follow an explicit instruction (mostly), but they won\u2019t engage their critical thinking skills while they do so, and they certainly won\u2019t go beyond the scope of the instruction. They\u2019re going through the motions of being a husband and father, and they figure that\u2019s good enough. Family isn\u2019t something they\u2019re supposed to *earn*, it\u2019s just something they *have*. \n\nSometimes they snap out of it when the situation gets dire enough. Sometimes, even if that happens, it\u2019s too late.

I think what's worse than him forgetting is that he didn't bother double checking if he was unsure. Husband and I know each other's usual orders at our favorite takeout places, but before placing the order, well usually double check. Especially after medical procedures, my husband knows I'm really sensitive. (I have extensive of medical trauma.) \n\nYour husband's reaction to his fuck up bothers me the most though. It doesn't sound like he apologized or even bothered to comfort his son who was going through a hard time. He just deflected to make it someone else's problem and went into self preservation mode. That wouldn't fly with me. You shouldn't have to ask a grown man to apologize. My 2yo knows how to do that.", "NTA. My dad was like this. It never got better, they FINALLY got divorced when I was 14(too late imo), and now we don\u2019t talk. Like ever. You\u2019re not being petty, it\u2019s not just about the chicken. But like, if he commits to therapy and working on things and you want to, maybe it will work out!", "NTA, you just said he was inconsiderate, and he has been. It's a pattern of behavior he can change. Getting an 11 yo's order wrong after a medical procedure will be a big deal to them.", "NTA. Even his sons notice. And his persistent refusal to even acknowledge it bothers me even more, because responses like him wanting to be appreciated for doing things when he did them wrong or badly is borderline DARVO.", "If this were the only incident, I\u2019d say let it go.

Show him what it like to live with someone who\u2019s so inconsiderate. I\u2019m not saying do it out of revenge or to be spiteful but so he can see how it feels. Make sure to mess up his take out order too next time you pick it up.", "I hate to say it but this was one of the many issues I had with my ex-husband. He would  get mad for me not appreciating him doing half the job. Honestly it's a hallmark of narcissist. I remember he would refuse to do housework because \"I complained that what he did wasn't good enough\". I would only complain when he would do a half the job. For example when I asked for him to clean up his mess, he would just move the mess from one room to another. Or just put things in the kitchen trashcan or garbage bag and not take it outside. Those people feel you should be honored that they even attempted. Not worth wasting your breath on because they will never listen.", "NTA this is called learned helplessness and far too many guys are very good at it. They make it so it\u2019s easier for their partner to just do it themselves or insist on their partner being a manager responsible for telling them exactly what they need to do step by step. It\u2019s something that needs to be addressed sooner than later or it will never end.", "NTA- this is a clear pattern of behavior over time. When people show you who they are, believe them.", "NTA, if it was just him messing up an order I\u2019d think he just forgot but he\u2019s done this multiple times. He\u2019s showing where his priorities lie and sadly its not with his family, my husband forgets things sometimes (portion sizes for our dogs) but even then he still remembers small things that he learned when we met hell this man will pick out cooked mushrooms from a dish because I made one comment about how I didn\u2019t like the texture 4 years ago \n\nCouples counseling could help your relationship IF he steps up and can acknowledge where he\u2019s falling short but if he can\u2019t do that then you do have to think about you and your kids because seeing how your parents act can create a kids perspective on how relationships are supposed to work, I don\u2019t have kids but I fully stand by the mindset if he or she can\u2019t/won\u2019t do things to make your life easier and make you happy then their not worth it. I\u2019ve used that line with my friends and even to my own mother when she invited us to meet her then bf because he wouldn\u2019t move for her so she can go to the bathroom, if someone won\u2019t change for you then you have to make the decision to either go to counseling and have them acknowledge their issues or acknowledge that you deserve someone who will remember the small things\n\nEdit: misspelled a word", "NTA. Your husband doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself. He could be more considerate. If he wanted to, he would.", "NTA, this is why I left my long term partner about 10 years ago. Some things shouldn't need to be said or ask of someone. My friends partner will literally go get himself dessert and come back in and sit with us all, eating a bowl of ice cream to himself. Doesn't occur to him that everyone he's hosting is just sitting there like.... ummm? And then his partner, without fail, every time will say \"I guess he just knew none of us wanted any.\" He's done it for 10 years, he just doesn't think to think of anyone else but himself. It's infuriating when you're constantly having to remind someone they're not the only person to exist.", "NTA for this.

And now your kids are putting up with it too?

But I wasn't so upset because of the fries. It was because in that moment I realized my dad truly doesn't pay attention to me.", "NTA. He simply doesn\u2019t care and has made that clear to both his wife and children. That\u2019s sad.", "Info: he has been like this for all 23 years you have been together. When did you expect him to change?", "NTA, especially since your kids have noticed this independently as well. Time for therapy??", "For the food order (in isolation) I would say NAH. He may have forgotten, slipped his mind or not thought it was a big deal (and personally you should have not made a big deal about it in front of your son, sure he was in pain and wanted a drumstick but he got a wing ... it happens, a minor thing as you put it). Think about how you would have handled the situation if your husband had ordered a drumstick but they'd given him a wing ... when life gives you a lemon make lemonade.\n\nThe rest of your post and eldest sons' comments suggest that perhaps your husband is an AH in other matters though, and I'd say this is what lead to you calling him inconsiderate over a \"minor thing\". The last paragraph suggests a pattern of selfishness, and an inability to take criticism. I'd be leaning to other subtle things happen that you may not even be aware of ... perhaps look into narcissism as my mind immediately went to the subtle things my partner mentions about her ex when she was only mentioning \"little\" things he did, without realising the \"bigger\" things he did and helped explained why he did these \"little\" things.\n\nFor example, the cake story about forgetting the candles in itself is not an issue (humans sometimes forget something like the candles) but for him to be angry that no one appreciated he got the cake is them needing validation for doing something that didn't directly serve their own purpose. A healthy reaction would have been to apologise for forgetting the candles (\"Aaah my bad, I'm sorry\") then maybe redirecting \"...but we weren't going to eat them anyway, let's enjoy the yummy cake\" or finding an alternative \"I'm sure we can find something else to burn instead ... \\[evil scientist laugh\\]\".", "respectfully\u2026 it physically pained me reading that you\u2019ve been with this man 23 years and he never got you a birthday cake. this incident obviously speaks to a larger issue, and while i am so sorry you and your kids must endure this emotional neglect, it is clear this man might not ever change without some kind of wake up call.

I was a picky eater as a kid and to this day (I\u2019m now 28) whenever I go home my mom will still save me the parts of the chicken I like and cook my favorite dishes! My dad probably couldn\u2019t even tell you what I like to it. It doesn\u2019t take a lot to just pay attention to your kid. NTA\n\nEdit: read the rest of this. Sounds like my dad. I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s your situation OP. My mom struggles with the same thing with my dad and I don\u2019t know how she puts up with it.

Nothing good comes out of a discussion or argument in the heat of the moment. Emotions and defences are running high. \n\nWhen there is more than one person involved, there are always two sides and two experiences to a situation.

My wife for instance will do some of the things you describe. It can be frustrating at times. Eating something that I've set aside for kiddos, leaving things out, using space to store something that's normally reserved for something else, etc. If he's doing these things because he doesn't care to invest the energy or because he's nonchalant in general then clearly he's an ah.

I called my husband to ask him to order because I was driving. Husband ordered and picked it up. 11 asked for his chicken and husband brings him a wing. 11 starts crying because he eats drumsticks, like every kid. Husband only ordered a wing and thigh. 11 has always eaten the same pieces (drumstick and breast to be specific). Husband got mad that I didn't tell him exactly what to order. I said if you don't know what your 11 year old eats then you don't know him.\n\nFor background we order from this place every month or so for over a decade. We each get the same things every time. Husband and I order equally. He handles the food (cooking and takeout) about 75% of the time.\n\nA little bit later I told husband that I don't want to fight but this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say he's not considerate. That all 3 of us feel like he doesn't care about us when he does this kind of stuff. I told him that 13 said \"dad always forgets the important stuff\" when he found out why 11 was crying. We all feel like he doesn't care when he forgets basic stuff about us. He dismissed me saying that doesn't mean I don't care about you. I said we feel like you don't care and you can't tell us how to feel. \n\nI've come to realize over the last year or so that my husband is inconsiderate, not just forgetful. Other examples: He will eat the kids last of a food or snack and not ask if they want it. I had a leg injury this year (in a cast and walker) and he left things in the walkway, even after I pointed out there was stuff in my way and I can't get around. He had to take care of 13's birthday cake because of my injury and didn't get candles. 13 was upset and husband got mad that no one appreciates that he got the cake. We've been together 23 years and he's never gotten me a cake, let alone put candles in it. His birthday is 6 weeks before mine. I always get him a cake or special dessert, put candles in it and sing happy birthday with the kids. \n\nSo AITA for calling my husband inconsiderate over a minor thing like messing up a food order?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He is not a sympathetic person, he can\u2019t understand how my emotions affect me so I have to be better about communication, but he also has to be receptive to that communication and listen, and do things. I would say if he is not receptive and is refusing to listen it might take something drastic for him to see it. But also he might not and you have to decide if you are ready for that outcome. Are you ready for the idea that he might not come around and you maybe become a single parent. Are you ready to accept that the feelings you have are not reciprocated.

He's focused on being a provider, but can't figure out what it really means to care ABOUT someone, not just care FOR them.\n\nIt's likely he didn't get that himself when he was growing up, so he never learned it. Be present, provide, make babies. That's what a lot of males are taught \"being a man\" means, especially those poor suckers who were raised in a macho-male-dominant household.\n\nTo him, these are trivial details. \"My kids eat chicken.

Expressing your feelings about his forgetfulness and inattentiveness is crucial for fostering understanding. However, the key lies in constructive communication. Instead of outright labeling him as inconsiderate, which might escalate tensions, you could delve deeper into the root of the issue.\n\nHelp him understand the emotional impact these incidents have on you and your sons. Discussing specific examples, like the birthday cake or the walker incident, could provide context to your concerns. Encourage an open dialogue where both of you can express your perspectives. It's not about assigning blame but finding solutions and mutual understanding.

The issue is that each of them feels that the husband is not invested in 'seeing' them , knowing the important things about them or the things that matter to them.\n\nYes, the boy can eat different parts of the chicken. But if the family has been ordering from the same place for over 10 years and everybody always gets the same thing, why didn't he remember what parts his son likes? Why didn't he ask if he forgot? Is he not emotionally invested in his family? \n\nIf I was married that long, I would expect my husband to start noticing things about me- like I always chose corn over beans when I dine out or that my favorite part of a chicken is drumstick (especially if we have ordered the same thing at the same restaurant for a decade) . I wouldn't expect him to show up at my hospital bed with beans and wings.\n\n*I've come to realize over the last year or so that my husband is inconsiderate, not just forgetful. Other examples: He will eat the kids last of a food or snack and not ask if they want it. I had a leg injury this year (in a cast and walker) and he left things in the walkway, even after I pointed out there was stuff in my way and I can't get around. He had to take care of 13's birthday cake because of my injury and didn't get candles. 13 was upset and husband got mad that no one appreciates that he got the cake. We've been together 23 years and he's never gotten me a cake, let alone put candles in it. His birthday is 6 weeks before mine. I always get him a cake or special dessert, put candles in it and sing happy birthday with the kids.*\n\nOP's husband has a wife and kids. It's not enough that he does the basics- go to work and provide for his family. It's called kindness and consideration. If the snack clearly belongs to the children, ask them if they want it before you eat it. Your wife has a leg injury, clear a path for her. Take the time to appreciate your loved ones special days ( and even some not so special days). It doesn't have to cost much- you can get a small cake in their favorite flavor or buy them a card. Just let them know that you 'see' them, you notice and remember things about them and you love them.", "NTA. \"He dismissed me..\" He can't even own up to it and offer to improve when you point it out.

So sad people don't appreciate their loved once while they are together.", "My ex was like this, it's one of the reasons I left him after 18 years. My boys, 11 and 14, now get to see me happy with a man who thinks of me and them always. Picks up random things, has our favourites in the fridge, notices something we would like... and could easily order for each of us in any restaurant. If he wanted to, he would. Your husband literally believes you should not only settle for the bare minimum but be grateful for it", "It sounds more to me like he's a bit inconsiderate, and you lot are acting spoiled/entitled.\n\nDon't get me wrong, leaving stuff in the walkway and stuff like that when your partner is injured is definitely a dick move, but something as minor as forgetting candles or not getting the food your son likes is very entitled. Of course, I don't know context of what he does, how he feels at the end of the day, or if he's someone who is unapologetic when he makes mistakes (my dad is like that.), as for all I know, he doesn't work very hard, he's not really that stressed/tired when he gets home, and is in fact just lazy. But you have to consider the possibility that maybe he does in fact have a lot more to worry about, than those little issues you and your kids always seem to complain about.\n\nIf you hate him so much, talk to him about divorce. I'm sure the load will be a bit lighter for you if those little issues bother you so much, otherwise, just stop draining him of whatever life he has left. There are people who don't do ANYTHING for their families, and I personally think you don't cut him enough slack.\n\nIn short, YTA when it comes to calling him inconsiderate over these minor things, but you're not wrong by calling him inconsiderate in general. But you should ask yourself why he is that way in the first place. There could be more to it than meets the eye.\n\nEdit: Reading through what I had just typed, I realize it seems more like I'm siding only with the father. I don't agree with him, I believe that a parent should always consider their family's needs first, no matter how trivial. If they forget, it's fine, we all do it, but being unapologetic, showing no remorse or even doing these things purposefully or for lack of care, I don't agree with. One may think, \"What's the harm?\", but there IS harm. Your relationship with your family takes damage every time you make the conscious decision to be an asshole or ignore even their simplest needs or wants. It's different if your situation is tough, and your husband is already struggling enough to keep everything together, but when you have enough to put that little bit of extra effort in without it costing you too much, it's best to take it, because it improves your relationship a great deal. I'm just trying to shed some light on the possibility that maybe he doesn't mean to be this way, and you need to seriously consider talking to him about it and asking what may be causing it, or seek couples therapy.\n\nIt's very easy to just call the other person the bad guy and call it a day. It's not always that simple. It is often difficult to look past surface level when you're the one in the situation, but it helps to take a step back and look at it from another point of view.", "I gotta disagree with the consensus here,,, sorry.  My husband probably wouldn\u2019t have thought to just order a chicken drumstick for a child\u2019s meal. (Our kids don\u2019t have a preference over which part of the chicken they eat, never have).  Some men are just like that. We\u2019ve been married 23 years, and he usually does the ordering, like you guys do. It was just this year that he started to remember to get my general tso\u2019s non spicy. Lol. I mean he just isn\u2019t detailed oriented.  And yeah I can imagine if I was hurt stuff being on the floor because he\u2019s typically not the one that picks stuff up. I can tell you though he is the most loving, generous, and patient man I\u2019ve ever been with. I hope your lil boy is doing ok (you mentioned he had medical procedures done) maybe if it was something like outpatient surgery your husband was preoccupied with thoughts of that.  I really used to get steamed at mike for being forgetful and not paying attention to details like me, but see that\u2019s the things he\u2019s not at all like me. I had to pick between being right (which I was) or being happy.  I chose happy. So I make sure that I tell him the details, most of the time more than a few times lol. I also wanted to add that every man is different. I am 100% positive my husband does not do this because he doesn\u2019t care, I\u2019ve talked to his sister and mother and even his dad at different times and they all told me that he has always been forgetful ect.

He likes direct comments and statements, not implied or inferred stuff. That said, he also doesn\u2019t forget once he\u2019s been told. So an indirect comment about who kind of prefers which chicken part may not land, but outright saying that Johnny only eats breast and drumsticks will, and he will also remember it.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a communication thing, and maybe he\u2019s an inconsiderate dingdong who needs telling that it *matters* to other people when you remember their meal orders, especially if he also expects others to remember when he hates certain foods.", "I heard about a couple who broke up because the wife washed the husbands smoking pipes. They had been married for decades. But that was the straw that broke the camels back. You can\u2019t wash them because the taste changes.

Or talk to him about what he thinks does to show affection and consideration. It can be a miscommunication but he sounds like an ass.
