I called my husband to ask him to order because I was driving. Husband ordered and picked it up. 11 asked for his chicken and husband brings him a wing. 11 starts crying because he eats drumsticks, like every kid. Husband only ordered a wing and thigh. 11 has always eaten the same pieces (drumstick and breast to be specific). Husband got mad that I didn't tell him exactly what to order. I said if you don't know what your 11 year old eats then you don't know him.\n\nFor background we order from this place every month or so for over a decade. We each get the same things every time. Husband and I order equally. He handles the food (cooking and takeout) about 75% of the time.\n\nA little bit later I told husband that I don't want to fight but this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say he's not considerate. That all 3 of us feel like he doesn't care about us when he does this kind of stuff. I told him that 13 said \"dad always forgets the important stuff\" when he found out why 11 was crying. We all feel like he doesn't care when he forgets basic stuff about us. He dismissed me saying that doesn't mean I don't care about you. I said we feel like you don't care and you can't tell us how to feel. \n\nI've come to realize over the last year or so that my husband is inconsiderate, not just forgetful. Other examples: He will eat the kids last of a food or snack and not ask if they want it. I had a leg injury this year (in a cast and walker) and he left things in the walkway, even after I pointed out there was stuff in my way and I can't get around. He had to take care of 13's birthday cake because of my injury and didn't get candles. 13 was upset and husband got mad that no one appreciates that he got the cake. We've been together 23 years and he's never gotten me a cake, let alone put candles in it. His birthday is 6 weeks before mine. I always get him a cake or special dessert, put candles in it and sing happy birthday with the kids. \n\nSo AITA for calling my husband inconsiderate over a minor thing like messing up a food order?", "created_utc": 1700095955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17w9d4o/aita_for_calling_my_husband_inconsiderate_for/", "score": 1117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re not impaired, they are just as capable as anyone of remembering details and noticing feelings when something is important to them, they just don\u2019t think it\u2019s important when it comes to their families. They will spend decades doing the bare minimum, often resentfully, and then act shocked when their wives slowly check out and their grown kids don\u2019t call them. \n\nThe worst thing is - it\u2019s not even malicious. They\u2019re not even thinking about their families\u2019 feelings that deeply. They don\u2019t think about them at all. They just live in their own little world. They\u2019ll follow an explicit instruction (mostly), but they won\u2019t engage their critical thinking skills while they do so, and they certainly won\u2019t go beyond the scope of the instruction. They\u2019re going through the motions of being a husband and father, and they figure that\u2019s good enough. Family isn\u2019t something they\u2019re supposed to *earn*, it\u2019s just something they *have*. \n\nSometimes they snap out of it when the situation gets dire enough. Sometimes, even if that happens, it\u2019s too late.

Dad needs to do better. NTA", "NTA it sounds like you're right.", "NTA, OP.  It will not change without some kind of epiphany or wake up call\u2026 and maybe not even then.  He has a huge blind spot of entitlement. Unless he knows it has ramifications\u2026 yeah\u2026 it won\u2019t change at all.

Most restaurants actually have a system in place where orders tend to be cataloged, so it probably wouldn't have taken even 2 seconds to ask them to bring up order history.", "NTA. I think what's worse than him forgetting is that he didn't bother double checking if he was unsure. Husband and I know each other's usual orders at our favorite takeout places, but before placing the order, well usually double check. Especially after medical procedures, my husband knows I'm really sensitive. (I have extensive of medical trauma.) \n\nYour husband's reaction to his fuck up bothers me the most though. It doesn't sound like he apologized or even bothered to comfort his son who was going through a hard time. He just deflected to make it someone else's problem and went into self preservation mode. That wouldn't fly with me. You shouldn't have to ask a grown man to apologize. My 2yo knows how to do that.", "NTA. My dad was like this. It never got better, they FINALLY got divorced when I was 14(too late imo), and now we don\u2019t talk. Like ever. You\u2019re not being petty, it\u2019s not just about the chicken. But like, if he commits to therapy and working on things and you want to, maybe it will work out!", "NTA, you just said he was inconsiderate, and he has been. It's a pattern of behavior he can change. Getting an 11 yo's order wrong after a medical procedure will be a big deal to them.", "NTA. Even his sons notice. And his persistent refusal to even acknowledge it bothers me even more, because responses like him wanting to be appreciated for doing things when he did them wrong or badly is borderline DARVO.", "If this were the only incident, I\u2019d say let it go.  But this is a pattern of shitty, uncaring behavior show to you and your kids.  NTA.", "NTA.  He sounds inconsiderate all around.  If my tweens were telling me that I don't pay attention and therefore, are essentially rude to them ON PURPOSE, I would listen.  He needs to grow up and become a father, not a third child.", "NTA: When it was just the chicken, I was going to say \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just forgetful or had one of those off days where their brain doesn\u2019t work\u201d (We\u2019ve all been there). From what you shared though, it\u2019s a regular problem. I\u2019d suggest giving him the same care he gives you and your sons.", "NTA and I\u2019d stop doing the things you do to be considerate of him, like making sure he has a cake on his birthday or any domestic chores you do that only benefit him (I.e. his laundry). Show him what it like to live with someone who\u2019s so inconsiderate. I\u2019m not saying do it out of revenge or to be spiteful but so he can see how it feels. Make sure to mess up his take out order too next time you pick it up.", "I hate to say it but this was one of the many issues I had with my ex-husband. He would  get mad for me not appreciating him doing half the job. Honestly it's a hallmark of narcissist. I remember he would refuse to do housework because \"I complained that what he did wasn't good enough\". I would only complain when he would do a half the job. For example when I asked for him to clean up his mess, he would just move the mess from one room to another. Or just put things in the kitchen trashcan or garbage bag and not take it outside. Those people feel you should be honored that they even attempted. Not worth wasting your breath on because they will never listen.", "NTA this is called learned helplessness and far too many guys are very good at it. They make it so it\u2019s easier for their partner to just do it themselves or insist on their partner being a manager responsible for telling them exactly what they need to do step by step. It\u2019s something that needs to be addressed sooner than later or it will never end.", "NTA- this is a clear pattern of behavior over time. When people show you who they are, believe them.", "NTA, if it was just him messing up an order I\u2019d think he just forgot but he\u2019s done this multiple times. He\u2019s showing where his priorities lie and sadly its not with his family, my husband forgets things sometimes (portion sizes for our dogs) but even then he still remembers small things that he learned when we met hell this man will pick out cooked mushrooms from a dish because I made one comment about how I didn\u2019t like the texture 4 years ago \n\nCouples counseling could help your relationship IF he steps up and can acknowledge where he\u2019s falling short but if he can\u2019t do that then you do have to think about you and your kids because seeing how your parents act can create a kids perspective on how relationships are supposed to work, I don\u2019t have kids but I fully stand by the mindset if he or she can\u2019t/won\u2019t do things to make your life easier and make you happy then their not worth it. I\u2019ve used that line with my friends and even to my own mother when she invited us to meet her then bf because he wouldn\u2019t move for her so she can go to the bathroom, is someone won\u2019t change for you then you have to make the decision to either go to coinciding and have them acknowledge their issues or acknowledge that you deserve someone who will remember the small things", "NTA. Your husband doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself. He could be more considerate. If he wanted to, he would.", "NTA, this is why I left my long term partner about 10 years ago. Some things shouldn't need to be said or ask of someone. My friends partner will literally go get himself dessert and come back in and sit with us all, eating a bowl of ice cream to himself. Doesn't occur to him that everyone he's hosting is just sitting there like.... ummm? And then his partner, without fail, every time will say \"I guess he just knew none of us wanted any.\" He's done it for 10 years, he just doesn't think to think of anyone else but himself. It's infuriating when you're constantly having to remind someone they're not the only person to exist.", "NTA for this. Why are you subjecting your children to live with a man who shows he doesn't care about them? Do you really believe it's good for their mental health?", "So you put up with this for 23 years? And now your kids are putting up with it too? Do you see the problem here?", "NTA You might want to give him some homework on the mental load and the default parent that resonate with your situation (I realise the heavy irony of that).

My dad got as all Mc Donald's and even though I always order the same thing (nuggets and fries), he got me only nuggets. \n\nI had a pretty big and embarrassing meltdown and my parents still laugh about it over a decade later. But I wasn't so upset because of the fries. It was because in that moment I realized my dad truly doesn't pay attention to me.", "NTA. He simply doesn\u2019t care and has made that clear to both his wife and children. That\u2019s sad.", "Info: he has been like this for all 23 years you have been together. When did you expect him to change?", "NTA, especially since your kids have noticed this independently as well. Time for therapy??", "For the food order (in isolation) I would say NAH. He may have forgotten, slipped his mind or not thought it was a big deal (and personally you should have not made a big deal about it in front of your son, sure he was in pain and wanted a drumstick but he got a wing ... it happens, a minor thing as you put it). Think about how you would have handled the situation if your husband had ordered a drumstick but they'd given him a wing ... when life gives you a lemon make lemonade.\n\nThe rest of your post and eldest sons' comments suggest that perhaps your husband is an AH in other matters though, and I'd say this is what lead to you calling him inconsiderate over a \"minor thing\". The last paragraph suggests a pattern of selfishness, and an inability to take criticism. I'd be leaning to other subtle things happen that you may not even be aware of ... perhaps look into narcissism as my mind immediately went to the subtle things my partner mentions about her ex when she was only mentioning \"little\" things he did, without realising the \"bigger\" things he did and helped explained why he did these \"little\" things.\n\nFor example, the cake story about forgetting the candles in itself is not an issue (humans sometimes forget something like the candles) but for him to be angry that no one appreciated he got the cake is them needing validation for doing something that didn't directly serve their own purpose. A healthy reaction would have been to apologise for forgetting the candles (\"Aaah my bad, I'm sorry\") then maybe redirecting \"...but we weren't going to eat them anyway, let's enjoy the yummy cake\" or finding an alternative \"I'm sure we can find something else to burn instead ... \\[evil scientist laugh\\]\".", "respectfully\u2026 it physically pained me reading that you\u2019ve been with this man 23 years and he never got you a birthday cake. this incident obviously speaks to a larger issue, and while i am so sorry you and your kids must endure this emotional neglect, it is clear this man might not ever change without some kind of wake up call. NTA you and your kids deserve better.", "I didn\u2019t read all of this because I stopped after you mentioned your kid only eats drumsticks. I was a picky eater as a kid and to this day (I\u2019m now 28) whenever I go home my mom will still save me the parts of the chicken I like and cook my favorite dishes! My dad probably couldn\u2019t even tell you what I like to it. It doesn\u2019t take a lot to just pay attention to your kid. NTA\n\nEdit: read the rest of this. Sounds like my dad. I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s your situation OP. My mom struggles with the same thing with my dad and I don\u2019t know how she puts up with it.

Nothing good comes out of a discussion or argument in the heat of the moment. Emotions and defences are running high. \n\nWhen there is more than one person involved, there are always two sides and two experiences to a situation.

I called my husband to ask him to order because I was driving. Husband ordered and picked it up. 11 asked for his chicken and husband brings him a wing. 11 starts crying because he eats drumsticks, like every kid. Husband only ordered a wing and thigh. 11 has always eaten the same pieces (drumstick and breast to be specific). Husband got mad that I didn't tell him exactly what to order. I said if you don't know what your 11 year old eats then you don't know him.\n\nFor background we order from this place every month or so for over a decade. We each get the same things every time. Husband and I order equally. He handles the food (cooking and takeout) about 75% of the time.\n\nA little bit later I told husband that I don't want to fight but this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say he's not considerate. That all 3 of us feel like he doesn't care about us when he does this kind of stuff. I told him that 13 said \"dad always forgets the important stuff\" when he found out why 11 was crying. We all feel like he doesn't care when he forgets basic stuff about us. He dismissed me saying that doesn't mean I don't care about you. I said we feel like you don't care and you can't tell us how to feel. \n\nI've come to realize over the last year or so that my husband is inconsiderate, not just forgetful. Other examples: He will eat the kids last of a food or snack and not ask if they want it. I had a leg injury this year (in a cast and walker) and he left things in the walkway, even after I pointed out there was stuff in my way and I can't get around. He had to take care of 13's birthday cake because of my injury and didn't get candles. 13 was upset and husband got mad that no one appreciates that he got the cake. We've been together 23 years and he's never gotten me a cake, let alone put candles in it. His birthday is 6 weeks before mine. I always get him a cake or special dessert, put candles in it and sing happy birthday with the kids. \n\nSo AITA for calling my husband inconsiderate over a minor thing like messing up a food order?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I will say that instead of doing it (I found I literally couldn\u2019t mimic the behaviors because it\u2019s not who I am and hurt me to do it), ask him how would you feel if I forgot your x, y, z and describe said situation to the other person reversing the positions. That normally works.", "It's not necessarily being done just to spite him. Sometimes it can open people's eyes\n\nMy husband used to have this super annoying habit of mansplaining filmmaking to me, even though that's literally what I do for a living. He loved explaining what depth of field was or how slow motion worked. I would tell him that I already know it, (in fact I know much more than he does), but he would just keep going. This went on for years, and I hated it\n\nThen one day, our nephew came over for dinner. Nephew had just started college to become a recording engineer (which is what my husband does for a living), and nephew man's mansplained audio recording to my husband all night long lol. My husband was so angry and insulted\n\nThen it dawned on him that that's EXACTLY what he had been doing to me, and he offered a sincere apology. And hasn't done it since\n\nSometimes people don't understand things until they experience it themselves", "I mean it kinda depends. My bf leaves kitchen stuff out for days and I end up cleaning it up, even after telling him and pointing out we *are starting to get flies* but if I leave out one spoon after mixing a pot, he gets annoyed and cleans.", "In my last relationship I had multiple people tell me to act the same way he did to see how he would react. I learned very quickly that I can't do that. I cannot put minimal effort into a relationship with someone that I love. It's all or nothing.", "Everyone in the family is crying over his behavior and he doesn\u2019t see a problem\u2026whatever it was, it\u2019s pretty bad right now.\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP. NTA and I hope he pulls his head out of his before he only sees your kids at holidays\u2026if that.", "I think you need to urgently schedule family counseling (of your choosing, not his) to make him understand that he lacks common sense and etiquette. Also that his lack of basic human courtesy is pushing his family away from him and it\u2019s going to have consequences in future.\n\nYears down the line, he should know this is why his sons have gone LC with him but are fine with you. NTA", "Here's how a lot of guys work. They wine and dine their gf, give her flowers and chocolates, fancy nights out and pretty jewelry, all for one purpose: to get into her pants. Once in, they miraculously stop the romance unless there's something in it for them (usually more s-e-x).\n\nThere's also weaponized incompetence. The person (often a man, but not always) will purposely do things wrong, \"forget\" stuff, etc, in an effort to not have to do any of the stuff they don't want to do, etc. The person's partner will then pick up the slack because it's easier than expecting their partner to do it right.", "That's even sadder. He knows the heartbreak of the situation, yet still inflicts the same indifference to his children and wife.", "Point that out! Point out that he\u2019s treating you and your children the same way he hated his parents treating him. If it made him upset, OF COURSE it makes you upset!", "omg. This sounds just like my dad! Does your guy ruin Christmas every year too? \ud83d\ude06 This dude needs to realize he\u2019s not okay and that you all (and he!) deserve better. Life doesn\u2019t have to be miserable.", "I'll be honest, it wasn't nearly this bad for me. But rather than return the (negative) energy to him, what I did was started spoiling myself.  I did \\*for myself\\* what he should have been doing.    He'd be like \"i'm sorry I forgot about your cake.\" That's okay I bought one for myself.  \"I didn't get your present in time...\" That's okay, I bought myself this thing. \n\nSuddenly he started realising how much I did that, and all of a sudden he was making a huge effort. To the point he had set up a page in OneNote for Christmas so when I see/think something I like and might want, it gets in there and he can come back to it later.", "This is a even bigger reason to choose couples therapy over resentment making actions which would make you as bad as him and making you feel guilt. You are setting an example for your kids and picking a path for your marriage which can get rear\nWally ugly. Choose wisely.", "So now he\u2019s doing the same for his wife and kids. Great.", "Sometimes, I have to talk to my husband about the way he interacts with our kids. He grew up with super strict parents who yelled and even physically hurt him. He doesn't and never would hurt them, but he sometimes loses his temper and yells at them. I sit him down alone and ask him to remember how his parents made him feel and if he really wants to do that to our kids. It helps him realize what he's done and to remember to be different with them. Maybe asking your husband to consider how his mom made him feel will help him see how he's making you all feel?", "I'd say this makes both suggestions of therapy and reciprocating his lack of effort necessary, but only after a very frank conversation about how you feel. Tell him how it hurts when he doesn't reciprocate the same consideration you show him, that it's hurting your marriage and your children, and you need to go to family therapy before it gets even worse. Let him know that until that happens, you can't sustain the one-way effort you've been putting in up until now. Maybe experiencing the same level of indifference he shows will help him understand if you communicate how desperate you are for him to appreciate how much he's been hurting his loved ones and how important therapy is for all of you, assuming he initially rejects the idea (which unfortunately seems very likely).", "Maybe try addressing that with him. Maybe he's afraid to put in effort or he never learned how. Ask him how it felt for his parents to ignore the basics and not put forth effort, which clearly withheld affection and care from him as a child. Draw the parallel to what he's doing to his kids. Sometimes people really aren't aware they're following in their parent's footsteps.", "Maybe you need to frame it that way to him. It bothered you when your parents didn\u2019t put any effort in for you. Is that how you want your kids to feel about you? Because they\u2019re already starting to express that they feel that way.", "lol, what?! In some cases, sure, but universally? I don't think so. If he doesn't celebrate her birthday and literally clearly does not care about her or the kids as people, I think the simplest thing she could do is stop the emotional labour he expects from her that goes above and beyond - like buying them treats and fun, exciting things. I'm not saying to ice him out completely, but some of the extra work that she has been doing doesn't have to continue while shes figuring out what she would like to do next. It doesn't even have to be petty. I am sure there are other ways she could spend the time that would be useful, and choose those neutrally.", "What does EQ behaviour mean", "Well, if he doesn't care about birthday cakes then it's not any sort of revenge. Though that's not likely to help the situation either.", "No, it\u2019s definitely maddening. I spent my life with one of these guys and you have to have a sense of humor about things you can\u2019t change, or you\u2019ll go absolutely insane.  Maybe OP hubby can change, who knows?\n\nEdit: I begged my parents to divorce forever and they finally did.  Pops never figured out he was inconsiderate, and he laments (LAMENTS!) the past .. \u201cwhat did I do!?\u201d  \u201cWas I so bad?!\u201d  And my personal favorite - and I could write a tome about his mindset.  It\u2019s not really my favorite, it\u2019s horrible, he would say \u201cI never drank, I never hit your mom\u201d.  That\u2019s his defense.  In his mind, he was blindsided by unreasonable expectations.  (He wasn\u2019t) in his brain he is completely innocent and loves his family.  (I\u2019m pretty sure he loves us, but he definitely never considered our feelings, even if we told him over and over.).", "The thing about not wanting to be like our shitty parents is that we have to actually do work to be better people. It\u2019s not enough just to want it. Like wanting a muscular body, you have to do something to make it actually happen.", "Be more observant and curious about women\u2019s experiences. It\u2019s a lot of us who\u2019ve lived this. More than you know. Maybe someday it\u2019ll get published in an acceptable sociology journal by an empathetic man so it\u2019ll be taken seriously.", "Oh dear lord. Helicopter moms like you are preparing your kids for a lifetime of disappointment.", "I'm willing to give him a mistake. Op didn't mention that this has happened before so it may well be the first time he's made this mistake.\n\nAnd why can't an 11yo eat a wing? Unless he's got an eating disorder or another good reason why not? Do we cater to kids every whim? I'm older so I guess things are different now but I don't see how this helps the child.\n\nIf it's a breaking point on top of other incidents I agree, but as a breaking point it's pretty insignificant.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he did throw a tantrum, and in any adult interpersonal relationship it\u2019s okay to be (non-aggressively) upset that a loved one doesn\u2019t remember basic things about you, especially during a vulnerable time.", "I've tried this across multiple relationships and it never works. It's like guys just don't get that caring about someone is in the details, not just the money.", "My oldest nephew was \u201chomeschooled\u201d and didn\u2019t learn a lot of basic social skills. One day another sister visited with her husband and the nephew (about 12 or 13) lectured his uncle for about an hour about GPS and how it worked. At the end he told his uncle, \u201cI hope you learned something today.\u201d\n\nMy BIL was an Air Force engineer who helped develop GPS. He was so polite and never gave away that fact, allowing the kid to enjoy sharing his knowledge. I am actually glad my nephew was excited about it, but his arrogant attitude is what got me. \n\nYears later, when he was grown and matured, I told him the truth, and we had a good laugh even though he was mortified that he\u2019d done that.", "But he knows what he\u2019s doing he just doesn\u2019t care.", "Oh how I would have loved to see that scene. You would start with an establishing shot which sets up and establishes context for the scene. Then you would do a close up of the nephew explaining audio recording. A close up shot is where you take the camera and put it close to someone to frame them. Then as your husband realizes he\u2019s annoying as fuck then you would whip pan to the husband\u2019s facial reaction. A whip pan is a type of pan where the camera moves so fast there is a blur. Know what this is going over your head I feel like I\u2019m talking to a wall you just don\u2019t get it. That\u2019s alright not everyone can be a filmmaker.", "Sounds like he sucks", "Perceived indifference,  OP sounds like she makes small things into huge deals so I don't trust her descriptions", "My ex didnt buy me birthday or chrismas presents, even though I would try to find great gifts for him.   My kids would do stuff for me, because they noticed at a young age that I never had a present under the tree.  I started buying myself my own Christmas and birthday presents, and I even wrapped them. It would be funny on Christmas morning when I would act all surprised as I unwrapped a present for myself. \"OMG! This is exactly what I wanted!\".", "Emotional intelligence", "I divorced a man after 4 years and one child together.  We both had to continue for the next year at the same address, so that lead to a lot of post divorced conversations where similar lamentations happened.  Once I said 'we always had to do the leisure activities you wanted, neveer one matching my interests'.  He actually apologised and then said 'What are your interests?'.  After four years he couldn't name one thing I liked to do?", "I'm a man who I would guess is a lot older than you. I have raised two pretty successful adults, and I will admit to making mistakes, such as the one you suggested. It does the child no good to go to bed hungry and does not teach them a damn thing, except to hate certain foods. I learned that by own experiences growing up. But keeping making assumptions.", "For us it may seems that way but a kid that's already under the weather, been promised his comfort food and then gets another rejection of his father in the way of forgetting to order said comfort food?\n\nI'm sorry but if a 13y old response is: **dad always forgets the IMPORTANT things**, chances are this is a frequent occurrence and this was posted in the story. OP even mentioned the 11y has a very diverse eating habit but this was the straw that broke the kid.\n\nWe don't cater to every whim but if I promise you a certain meal, that I know is your favourite. And I arrived with something vastly different yet the same, you'd be disappointed as well, you probably won't cry about it because again, we are adults, but you'd remember it.", "I finally got around to reading The 5 Love Languages and there\u2019s a whole chapter in there about continuing to just love selflessly with faith that the partner will come around, assuming you are really serious about committing to the relationship. It gave me weird vibes reading it, but I can understand the idea. Kind of in line with your comment \u2014 being spiteful just breeds more resentment. Obviously reminding your spouse and yourself about the love that was there is going to take longer if only one person is really trying at first. I just worry that if I were put in that situation, even if it worked and my husband started making me feel loved again, I\u2019d just feel resentful that the marriage was saved because of ME.

I have a friend that I've only known for 3 years and they know what I like to order at pretty much every restaurant in our area that we go too. It's a small thing but it shows they're listening and noticing what I like and remembering that. Remembering small things like that can show you care about someone else.
