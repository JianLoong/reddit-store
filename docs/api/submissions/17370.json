She said I can't be seriously comparing her to her friends and sisters and insisted \"I'm the mother of your kid.\".

I always get her gifts on her birthdays and our anniversary. I also get her a gift on women's day. For the mother's day one I didn't get one because it's about honoring my mom. So like she'd get her mom a gift I'd get my mom a gift. But my wife's not my mom. She's my wife.\n\nShe said that's not how it works and that she's the mother of my kid and she'd like to be honored on that day by me too. I told her she'll be honored when our kid(s) grow and shower her with gifts I just don't understand why I have to get her a gift as well because she's my wife not my mom and by that logic I should get gifts to all the moms I know including my friends and my sisters. She said I can't be seriously comparing her to her friends and sisters and insisted \"I'm the mother of your kid.\". She also brought up how her dad always got mothers day gifts for his wife and his mom and all the men she knows do that and is hurt to see me just dismissing her feelings.\n\nI grew pretty tired of that argument and left because she was acting so materialistic over this.\n\nI told my mom about it and she said that my wife is a crybaby. My two sisters were also present when I visited my mom and they started cussing me out saying I'm an idiot. There was a whole argument between my mom, me and my sister's with my sisters saying  me and my mom are ridiculous and unreasonable.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She literally JUST had your baby and she still sleeps in your bed, and you already don't even care. You're the one making this about money.

Your friends really aren't the mother of your anything, but the women at my work tell each other Happy Mother's Day anyway just as a way to acknowledge a very big part of each other's lives. Did you not even congratulate your friends when they gave birth? What did you say when your kid was born? Can't imagine having your attitude.

YTA again, just saying. \n\n>I told my mom about it and she said that my wife is a crybaby.\n\nDouble or triple YTA for this. First for letting it happen, and then for having to ask Reddit if it's acceptable. You're a father now, maybe try to have ONE singular independent thought. Think you can do that?

All the decorations appearing all over are exactly the kind of reminder we need to help us remember this occasion that we do want to celebrate. \n\nBut you need to talk about these kind of things and the expectations you have of one another.

You ignored her, got tired of her, and ran to your mommy who called her a crybaby, and you let that happen because it validated you.

How can I make it up to you?\" Then you try to correct the mistake. \n\n2: You're right, your wife is not your mother, but this logic is going to backfire fast in more ways than just this aspect of your life if you stick with it and she turns it around on you..\nAnd I'm not just talking Father's Day, because you probably don't care about it since she's obviously not your Dad. \n\nThree months ago your wife pushed a small human being out of something the size of a donut. If she had a C-section then three months ago she was cut open, had a small human pulled out of her body, and LIVED to tell the tale and be a mother to that small human that you are now responsible for helping raise. The least you could have done is buy her something small on that child's behalf as a thank you to their mom for bringing them into the world. \n\nYour wife, the mother of your child, deserves better treatment than to be called a crybaby and materialistic on Mother's Day only three months after going through something that could have killed her. \n\nIf that still doesn't move you and you're still stuck on how your mom did that first then try this for perspective: If your mother told you that on her first mother's day she was told she was materialistic and a crybaby, and that it hurt her how would that make you feel then? Don't focus on if she ever would say that, just if she did say that, how would that make you feel about your mother?\n\nIf you have/had a daughter and her husband did this to her three months after giving birth, how would that make you feel? \n\nIf your answer to that is anywhere in the realm of they deserved to be dismissed and called a crybaby, then you do not deserve the women in your life, and that includes your mother, because I doubt you'd want someone to treat your mother the way you are treating your child's mother.", "you and your mom kinda really suck\u2026 Mother\u2019s Day isn\u2019t just celebrating your mother, it\u2019s celebrating the important women in you life that are mothers (guess what, your wife\u2019s a mom and she deserves some recognition and celebration)!! and then the silly name calling?? she just had a baby not that long ago and she is excited to be included in a holiday meant for people like her (mothers) only to be excluded. no you don\u2019t go getting gifts for your friends and sisters who are also mothers (you can, but they are not so much a responsibility, they also have their husbands, hoping they are still in picture) you call them or message them a happy Mother\u2019s Day.\n\ngrow up, you don\u2019t just have your mommy anymore, you have your wife too now, and she is now a MOTHER (key word in case you didn\u2019t get it), the name calling and dismissive-ness was not fair or appropriate to her, neither your nor your mom should have been saying that stuff in the first place.\n\nyta", "YTA.\n\nMother's day (in the US) is a day to show love and appreciation to the people in our lives who do the work of motherhood; your child isn't old enough to show appreciation and love to your wife, so that falls on you (as your child ages, it is your responsibility to teach and show how we show love and appreciation - which means you're responsible for making sure your child is abe to present a gift or token of affection to it's mom until at least that child is 18yo).\n\nYou messed up.", "YTA.

But it taught me to learn to make special holidays happen, instead of just waiting for good things to come to me.\n\nIt didn't make me feel put up on. It made me feel important. I was a \"valuable\" participant\n\nI'll always thank my parents for this wise parenting", "Sounds like your husband is a sweetheart and those other people are assholes. People love to gate-keep. Hoping for a happy and healthy baby for you both!", "Oh, but she will. Because *she's* NOT an AH!", "He should be fine waiting until the children are old enough to give him gifts.", "LOL\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Hopefully she sends him a link to this post \ud83d\ude02", "I hope OP's wife finds his post just for this.", "this made me lol", "Wish I had a real  award for you \ud83c\udfc6", "THIS.  Absolutely this.  \n\nI've dealt with someone who expected everyone to bend over backward for their birthday, etc - but had to be reminded of others' special events.  With these people, it's all about THEM. \n\nAfter many years of this, we divorced. Mother's Day that year, he said not a word to me (which was fine by me), but he had the kids that weekend and didn't bother to have them even get me a card or anything. Not a word was said. My birthday came & went, and not a word, even though he had the kids for visitation on my birthday. \n\nI forgot his bday and didn't have the kids call to wish him a happy birthday. I didn't do it intentionally, it seriously just wasn't top-of-mind for me, as I was busy handling the daily needs of a household with 3 kids and all that includes. \n\nHe calls, very pissed: \"You didn't have the kids even call me on my birthday!\"\n\nMe: \"It wasn't intentional.  I actually forgot.  But I didn't hear a word from you or the kids on Mother's Day or MY birthday, even though they were with you on those days & you could have easily had them just get me a card or make a phone call. But you know what?  That's the magic of divorce - POOF! - your birthday no longer registers as an important day in my mind - just like mine apparently never did for you.\"", "Perfection!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "America is the only country in the world. No other countries exist and if they do, it's not America's problem if they choose different days to celebrate events./s", "But it can be clear that it is the context of someone WANTING to be honored, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here. If someone wanted that, & their spouse actively refused, it shows the lack of respect & a disregard for their feelings. Which is something abuse people do too. Ofc the Venn Diagram isn\u2019t a circle, but there is some overlap", "You\u2019re twisting someone\u2019s words so you can go off about how special you are for not celebrating holidays. Nobody cares", "Dude, this isn't a courtroom. You know what we mean. Stop splitting hairs.", "My parents have a really crappy dynamic which spilled over into our entire family. To this day I make sure to get my mom a bday gift not because I genuinely want to celebrate her but because of that core memory. It makes me feel guilty, but it is what it is at this point. This is potentially what OP is creating in his home. Totally sucks.", "If it was me he wouldn't be getting shit. I would be spending that day with my father cause he is not her father...lol... use his own logic against him and let him fend for himself...he's a moron", "Maybe not anymore", "So many assumptions being made in this comment chain lol. A lot of bitterness.\n\nIt's a hallmark holiday ffs.", "LOL this reminds me of a conversation I had with an American, here in France. \n\n\"What will you do on the 4th of July?\"\n\"I don't know, probably work?\"\n\"Don't you go somewhere to see fireworks and celebrate?\"\n\"Celebrate what?\"\n\"Independence!\"\n\"Who's independence from what?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"What?\"\n\nYeah... Mother's day is 6th of June this year by the way... It's usually celebrated on the last Sunday of May, but if that coincides with another holiday, it gets moved to the next Sunday.", "That's just the thing though- I don't think it's about a gift, that's just how OP sees it. It doesn't sound like she got a cup of tea in bed or a card or a peck on the cheek, no sort of appreciation at all.\n\nIt suits OP to say that his wife was pouting because she didn't get a gift because then he can claim she's materialistic and run to his mother, who probably always tells him he's right. He either can't or won't see that even the smallest crumb of recognition would have made his wife happy.", "Wow. Tell me you\u2019re a misogynist without telling me you\u2019re a misogynist.", "Same!! I send bday cards and mother/father day cards and Xmas presents across the country whether I can afford or not. Countless irrational meltdowns by my mother have conditioned me \ud83e\udd22", "Not every mom boohoos over not getting gifts. My husband didnt even tell me happy mothers day but im not complaining the day before he didnt tell me happy birthday once again dont care... The only thing that matters to me over any mothers day or birthday is that my kids are taken care of and have what they need. I dont need someone to tell me or give me anything because i decided to become a mom. The best gift of all is spending time with my children. The ones who made me a mom. I dont need my husband to go buy me flowers or a necklace or a card. A hug from my kids and seeing that they are happy and healthy is all I needed to be happy.", "You are not alone. Hugs to you internet stranger. Let\u2019s do it different for the next generation. I have 2 kiddos now, and I know I\u2019m gonna make mistakes, but I\u2019m doing my best to be intentional about creating a loving, vulnerable space with my family now."]}
