I told her she'll be honored when our kid(s) grow and shower her with gifts I just don't understand why I have to get her a gift as well because she's my wife not my mom and by that logic I should get gifts to all the moms I know including my friends and my sisters. She said I can't be seriously comparing her to her friends and sisters and insisted \"I'm the mother of your kid.\". She also brought up how her dad always got mothers day gifts for his wife and his mom and all the men she knows do that and is hurt to see me just dismissing her feelings.\n\nI grew pretty tired of that argument and left because she was acting so materialistic over this.\n\nI told my mom about it and she said that my wife is a crybaby.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\nMy wife has been sad and upset on how I overlooked getting a gift for her on mother's day. We welcomed our first kid 3 months ago so she's a first time mom.\n\nThe reason I didn't get her a gift wasn't because I don't love her or anything. I always get her gifts on her birthdays and our anniversary. I also get her a gift on women's day. For the mother's day one I didn't get one because it's about honoring my mom. So like she'd get her mom a gift I'd get my mom a gift. But my wife's not my mom. She's my wife.\n\nShe said that's not how it works and that she's the mother of my kid and she'd like to be honored on that day by me too. I told her she'll be honored when our kid(s) grow and shower her with gifts I just don't understand why I have to get her a gift as well because she's my wife not my mom and by that logic I should get gifts to all the moms I know including my friends and my sisters. She said I can't be seriously comparing her to her friends and sisters and insisted \"I'm the mother of your kid.\". She also brought up how her dad always got mothers day gifts for his wife and his mom and all the men she knows do that and is hurt to see me just dismissing her feelings.\n\nI grew pretty tired of that argument and left because she was acting so materialistic over this.\n\nI told my mom about it and she said that my wife is a crybaby. My two sisters were also present when I visited my mom and they started cussing me out saying I'm an idiot. There was a whole argument between my mom, me and my sister's with my sisters saying  me and my mom are ridiculous and unreasonable.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She literally JUST had your baby and she still sleeps in your bed, and you already don't even care. You're the one making this about money.

Your friends really aren't the mother of your anything, but the women at my work tell each other Happy Mother's Day anyway just as a way to acknowledge a very big part of each other's lives. Did you not even congratulate your friends when they gave birth? What did you say when your kid was born? Can't imagine having your attitude. Now, I would understand if you just couldn't buy overpriced flowers or German chocolates, but you are opposed to even caring about your own family. YTA again, just saying. \n\n>I told my mom about it and she said that my wife is a crybaby.\n\nDouble or triple YTA for this. First for letting it happen, and then for having to ask Reddit if it's acceptable. You're a father now, maybe try to have ONE singular independent thought. Think you can do that?

All the decorations appearing all over are exactly the kind of reminder we need to help us remember this occasion that we do want to celebrate. \n\nBut you need to talk about these kind of things and the expectations you have of one another.

My husband was working in the ER at the time and didn't have time to get anything else. I was still super touched, even when I realized he'd snipped the rose from my first prize rose bush, lol.", "Depends where you are. It's September in some places", "Agreed", "You\u2019re here acting like all these mothers demand to be showered in material things because they \u201cspread their legs\u201d. A simple act to show appreciation can be a enough. I should\u2019ve checked your recent comment history before replying. No point talking to you.", "Im not saying they dont deserve to be shown they are appreciated. That is not what I mean at all, but most people have been acting like they deserve $800 worth of crap. I just don't think women who are mothers should be shown they are appreciated more then on some stupid made up holiday. I would rather be shown on a random Tuesday that everything I do as a mother is appreciated. Spend time with your children. They are why you are a mother. If you rather be bought a bunch of stuff then whatever thats your choice. BUT most men dont think like women and plan stuff. So do it yourself or dont whine about it. I dont need random strangers on the internet to validate my feelings and tell me I deserve something because I am a mom. The BEST thing I had happen on Mothers that made me feel more loved and appreciated was my nonverbal son hugging me and giving me a kiss on the cheek. That is more then any stupid gift or whatever from my husband. But thats just me."]}
