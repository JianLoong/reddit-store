To celebrate, she and her boyfriend went away for the weekend, and when they returned she planned a dinner for the following week with family and friends. It was a buffet-style dinner, where everyone brought something and guests could take what they wanted to. My wife - her stepmother - was immediately excited as she loves to cook, and planned to bring two courses, a main course and a dessert, both that she had cooked multiple times that our sons love. \n\nA few days later, my daughter told me she had to cancel the party. She had planned to throw it at her boyfriend's house, but new neighbours had moved in next door who were having lots of work done to the house so it was too loud, and there was not enough room in her flat. So, I offered to host at our house, there was plenty of space and we know most of her friends and relatives already so there was no one we were uncomfortable with inviting into our home. She was unsure at first, but eventually agreed.\n\nHere's where I might be a bit of an asshole. My daughter had always said the party was 18+, it was expected to go on for a few hours and people were planning to drink. However, my wife and I have three sons, 15, 12 and 8, and we could not kick them out of the house for the night. My wife said that my daughter would know that by having the party here, her brothers would be invited, but apparently she did not as even her own children and her boyfriend's daughter had been excluded from the guest list. Everything was fine at first, but when all the guests arrived and dinner was served, my wife called for my sons to join us in the dining room and my daughter was visibly unhappy with this, but she did not say anything. She seemed to be avoiding us for the rest of the night and left with her friends far earlier than she said she was going to, deciding to drink at a local bar instead. Her boyfriend stayed to help clean up, but he did not say much.\n\nAt first I assumed she just didn't want to get drunk around her parents, but the following day she texted me expressing her upset that I had ignored her wishes and invited her brothers, that the event was supposed to be adults only for a reason and it made a lot of her friends uncomfortable to have children around when they were supposed to be drinking/relaxing. She said that when I offered to host the event she thought I knew what I was taking on. I will admit that my 15yr old was rather annoying to her and some of her friends, but I do not think that their presence ruined the entire evening, and I do not see why, with so much home-cooked food in the house, my sons were expected not to eat any. And I do not see why her friends could not drink or relax just because my sons were there. My wife insists we did nothing wrong, that my daughter should've known the boys would be there since they live here, but I can now see that this is not what my daughter wanted for her birthday celebration and worry I am the asshole.\n\nAITA?

That being said, I think this comment in addition to your many *many* assumptions just goes to show you have absolutely no idea how to communicate with anyone around you. Not once did you say to your daughter \"so I guess since the venue has changed, the boys will be at your dinner?\" Not once did you ask your daughter what her food preferences would be.

They engage in adult conversations about adult topics using adult language. If a fellow adult is being annoying or obnoxious, they can address that behavior one adult to another. When kids are present, the conversations are not \u201crelaxing\u201d anymore. Your language is modified to an appropriate level depending on the age of the youngest member within earshot (which also means you are constantly monitoring where the children are). The options of topics of discussion are narrowed because Susie isn\u2019t going to vent about the struggles of her ongoing divorce in front of nine year old, and Bobby isn\u2019t going to bring up that excellent article about the intricacies of the ongoing drug problem in America and the inadequacy of the current political and governmental response because frankly he doesn\u2019t want to entertain the opinions of a fifteen year old who lacks the emotional and intellectual maturity to do anything but infantilize the conversation. And you can\u2019t really tell a a twelve year old to piss off when he won\u2019t stop trying to redirect the flow of conversation towards his Pok\u00e9mon card collection.\n\n\nIt is important for kids to partake in conversation with adults and observe how adults interact, but the appropriate time for that is not at a birthday celebration where adults are relaxing. Everyone else at that party found (and presumably paid for) childcare. It would have been MUCH cheaper for everyone to drink at the host\u2019s home instead of going out and buying alcoholic beverages at an establishment. All of the people who showed up to this party expected it to be a child free evening where they could drink alcohol and mentally relax to the extent possible and appropriate when in the company of adults.", "YTA \n\nWhat you should have done: You set them up with a movie and make them plates. \n\nWhat you did: You literally *invited them* as part of the evening. Sure they live there. But it\u2019s extremely rude that you didn\u2019t consider a separate activity for them. And it\u2019s even more rude that you saw your 15 year old being annoying and did nothing", "When grown ups have a party it is perfectly normal for children in the house to eat in a different space (if your fortunate enough to have enough space) and perhaps have their own entertainment such as a film or games, with the grown ups checking in.

Who wants to be annoyed, at anytime, by anyone?\n\n3) that you cannot imagine that a group of young adults, celebrating a major life event such as a milestone birthday, may want to discuss ideas and experiences from the past and future that may not be suitable for teenage relatives to overhear. Most similar parties I have been to for such birthdays have involved talk of love lives, sex lives, relationships, ideas about children, the first deaths in the group,  illness, parental divorce, and all the other disappointments so far and the many future hopes.

Yet she seems to think she had no responsibility for having the party turn out as it did. A lot of this would have been different if communication had been better. Was it the party she envisioned? No, but then they rarely are... she's in for a world of pain, if this is how she reacts to life. \n\nMy mom called me on my 30th birthday and didn't even wish me a happy birthday.

Why was step-mom making food they love and not food she loves? It was HER birthday! When you offered to host you should have put what she wanted first. If you were going to put your sons first you should have told her so she could make other arrangements. I bet this happens all the time.", "YTAH. You are spot on. You and your wife are assuming idiots. If you were not sure you should have asked. Just because it was at your house didn\u2019t mean it was your party.

Maybe your daughter was trying to be nice by not bringing up her desire to not have your sons there. Does it matter? It was her birthday! \n\nWell at least now your daughter knows you and your wife are AHs and not to trust you with specifics. Is that why you did it?

You know, actually 18+ stuff. Got reaaaally drunk maybe. \n\nAre you sure you wanted your kids around that talks and stuff? Your 8 yo especially?\n\nI don't mean to shame people for talking adult stuff, getting drunk on a party \u2013 especially as far as it was planned beforehand and clearly under control. But around kids you just got to think twice what to talk, what to do, how much drinks to have. You can't relax properly. And this is clearly what was planned.\n\nAnd seeing how you aren't very initiative, OP, I don't think you would want to handle the talks and QA with your kids after such a party. So instead of you taking some action and responsibility, your daughter had to cut her party.\n\nAnd actually it would be interesting to know what the relationship between her and her brothers are like, 'cause as I understand that, they are step siblings, aren't they?\n\nYTA.", "YTA the kids could've stayed in their rooms and had some of the food seperately they didn't have to join the party and you should've intervened when you noticed the 15yo bothering the guests.", "Honestly the only Asshole things I see are the step mom making the sons fav food and OP/step mom not stopping the kid from annoying ppl. \n\nEverything else is lack of communication on BOTH parties.

It\u2019s her birthday man. She was hesitant to even bring it to the house, but eventually agreed because I\u2019m sure pops was more than happy to offer. So she agrees, says it\u2019s 18+, their children aren\u2019t even coming, and no one\u2019s asking the boys to get kicked out lmao. I\u2019ve been in my room on video games while events went on in the house. Everyone was happy. This isn\u2019t a stranger or even a friend being allowed to use your house. This is a dad, offering to host a part for his daughter who is turning 30 with her other adult friends. You may call it entitlement, sure I can get that. But she was going to cancel the party - she did not ask for this. Why even offer and then be AH about something like this? In multiple comments the dad says how he noticed the boys being a little annoying BUT he didn\u2019t think they were. He says many times how he felt or what he saw but that doesn\u2019t speak on what everyone else felt. Especially since he admits he could tell from multiple guests that they were annoyed/bothered. Like come on, i have an older sister who\u2019s had parties, if I was to bother my sister and her friends just once or twice my mom would have told me to cut it out and let them have fun. And this is for my sister turning 16 while I\u2019m 12, not full grown adults drinking", "The party was adult only.  She had specified it was only for 18+. She had no reason to expect her wishes for her own birthday would be ignored by the people who volunteered to host an event she has already set clear guidelines for attendance. You\u2019re right, though. Her dad and stepmom should absolutely have communicated their intention to ignore her plans.", "NTA. Exactly! This is a miscommunication issue. I\u2019m surprised at the number of YTA. I would have expected her to ask about the brothers during the discussion about having party at parents house.", "Feeding is obvious. Why were they actively a part of this 18+ party that was said beforehand, and daughter invited to have said party in home for her birthday by her father?", "You know OP could\u2019ve fed his children and still not let them attend the party, right?", "Absolutely. Well said.", "I agree, the comments are violently american in their individualism, what happened to having a unified family and to be tolerant. Why wouldnt the daughter at least dare to voice her concerns instead of leaving her own party and complaining after\u2026. some people just get mad when they dont get their will", "In literally any other room of the house? They have bedrooms, no?", "This is where I'm leaning, with a scoosh more YTA for OP.\n\nThis is the house where the kids live. There was a lot of assumptions on both sides about where the younger siblings would be. Y'all have to use your voices.\n\nBut, the scoosh more YTA is that you needed to be a parent and rein in the kids when they got annoying.", "I don\u2019t understand why the initial thought is \u201cdid she want the boys kicked out of their own house??\u201d. She was going to cancel her party. Her dad offered to host his daughters birthday party at his house. She was hesitant. She agreed but it was stated it was an 18+ event and their will be drinking and that\u2019s what she envisioned. Dad said okay. \n\nNow the day of the party, here\u2019s the kicker - her brothers live there, but they do not need to actively be part of the party. Dad in the post and comments says multiple times he noticed daughter/other guests visibly uncomfortable. That 15 year old has interrupted/made remarks a couple times throughout dinner. It is made clear as dinner continues that the boys are invited to this, aren\u2019t going to be leaving, and I would assume after dinner they would just be hanging around. It\u2019s not the end of the world, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be drinking, talking shit and joking in front of kids I literally don\u2019t know (as her guests). So they eventually leave but as the daughter I would also be left with the feeling like wtf was that? Like why invite us over and offer to host, to have kids invited? It is their house blah blah blah but come on. I would want to throw a great party for my kid, I offered! \n\nAnd the boys could have gotten a plate of food and *gasp* gone to another room. No one needs to be on the street. Get some food, some snacks, video games, etc and set them up. Upstairs, downstairs, separate room, etc. That was the answer. No one is kicked out, your provide reasonable accommodations for all your kids after offering to host this 18+ party. In the sub it\u2019s AH or not, which seems a little unfitting here as his heart was in the right place. But he was TA in a sense for not using a bit of common sense or at the very least stopping the boys from being annoying and separating them when he noticed people being uncomfortable. Instead he says, which I believe he\u2019s changed his thinking now, that he didn\u2019t think it was that bad. And that type of thinking can go sideways quickly - \u201coh I was joking it wasn\u2019t that serious\u201d \u201cI was barely being mean, it was nothing\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not that annoying, get over it\u201d - minimizing other feelings because you can\u2019t or won\u2019t see it from others perspective", "Are 15, 12, and 8 year olds not capable of hanging out in their rooms for a few hours?", "When did the daughter say she expected the kids to stay somewhere else?

It seems to me she would have been perfectly fine cancelling the party, as was her intention.", "Yeah and he says he saw the look on her face when the boys were called for dinner. It wouldn't have been too late to backtrack a bit and have the boys fix plates and go back to wherever they'd been hanging out", "I'm sure these kids could have occupied themselves with video games or tv for a few hours before bed while this party occurred.

From her strength of reaction, I\u2019d bet this is a pattern, not a one-off. You should be clear that you\u2019re going to lose your relationship with her if you keep editing what she tells you to be more convenient for you, than playacting like you were too stupid to understand and blaming her for not telling you what she told you.
