To celebrate, she and her boyfriend went away for the weekend, and when they returned she planned a dinner for the following week with family and friends. It was a buffet-style dinner, where everyone brought something and guests could take what they wanted to. My wife - her stepmother - was immediately excited as she loves to cook, and planned to bring two courses, a main course and a dessert, both that she had cooked multiple times that our sons love. \n\nA few days later, my daughter told me she had to cancel the party. She had planned to throw it at her boyfriend's house, but new neighbours had moved in next door who were having lots of work done to the house so it was too loud, and there was not enough room in her flat. So, I offered to host at our house, there was plenty of space and we know most of her friends and relatives already so there was no one we were uncomfortable with inviting into our home. She was unsure at first, but eventually agreed.\n\nHere's where I might be a bit of an asshole. My daughter had always said the party was 18+, it was expected to go on for a few hours and people were planning to drink. However, my wife and I have three sons, 15, 12 and 8, and we could not kick them out of the house for the night. My wife said that my daughter would know that by having the party here, her brothers would be invited, but apparently she did not as even her own children and her boyfriend's daughter had been excluded from the guest list. Everything was fine at first, but when all the guests arrived and dinner was served, my wife called for my sons to join us in the dining room and my daughter was visibly unhappy with this, but she did not say anything. She seemed to be avoiding us for the rest of the night and left with her friends far earlier than she said she was going to, deciding to drink at a local bar instead. Her boyfriend stayed to help clean up, but he did not say much.\n\nAt first I assumed she just didn't want to get drunk around her parents, but the following day she texted me expressing her upset that I had ignored her wishes and invited her brothers, that the event was supposed to be adults only for a reason and it made a lot of her friends uncomfortable to have children around when they were supposed to be drinking/relaxing. She said that when I offered to host the event she thought I knew what I was taking on. I will admit that my 15yr old was rather annoying to her and some of her friends, but I do not think that their presence ruined the entire evening, and I do not see why, with so much home-cooked food in the house, my sons were expected not to eat any. And I do not see why her friends could not drink or relax just because my sons were there. My wife insists we did nothing wrong, that my daughter should've known the boys would be there since they live here, but I can now see that this is not what my daughter wanted for her birthday celebration and worry I am the asshole.\n\nAITA?

That being said, I think this comment in addition to your many *many* assumptions just goes to show you have absolutely no idea how to communicate with anyone around you. Not once did you say to your daughter \"so I guess since the venue has changed, the boys will be at your dinner?\" Not once did you ask your daughter what her food preferences would be.

Learn to use your words.", "You do a lot of assuming instead of actually communicating, apparently. Try using your words.", "OP-Why did you post this if you're going to argue with everyone who tells you that you are, in fact, the asshole here? You asked, reddit answered. YTA.", "Have you never heard the saying \"never assume, it makes an ass out of you and me\". You are clearly fond of assumptions, and even your responses appear lethargic. Apologise to your daughter, both ypu and your wife, for your assumptions!", "He could even say that the offer is depended on the condition that they will come, but he just assumed everyone can read his mind", "If you offer to host an 18+ party, and then you invite children to it, you have wasted the time and energy of the guests that came to the party on the understanding it was for 18+ aged people only.\n\nYTA, and so are you, u/alcohall183 for being too obtuse to understand that.", "A good host would have made sure she was aware that there would be underage kids present. Then it would have been up to the daughter to decide if she still wanted her party there or not.", "This is a sad excuse. When my parents lived overseas my dad regularly invited his friends, business associates etc to have a home cooked meal at the house (it was always scheduled in advance and my mom was ok with it) or they would hold parties. Me and my sisters knew to not disturb my dad unless he called us over for introductions and even then it'd be around 5 minutes. My mom made sure me and my sisters ate before the event, in the kitchen or our room if the kitchen was really crowded. Even though it was our house, we weren't part of the event and we knew how to behave.", "She did say something, when she said adults only. You just took that to mean \u201cfor thee and not for me\u201d. I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume this was a mistake; in the future, ALWAYS ask. Clarify! \u201cHey the boys will be here, is it okay if they join dinner?\u201d Very easy to ask, double check, and make sure. \n\nYou know what they say about when you assume\u2026\nSoft YTA, in the hopes that you really are just oblivious.", "You should not have lffered if you were not going to go through with her plan.

They  are permitted to fill a dinner plate & return to doing their own thing(s). You say that at least 1 boy annoyed daughter's friends, so the kids do not appear to have grabbed food & disappeared. \n\nIdeally, you lay down the law w/the boys ahead of the party. You then share the plan w/daughter (providing her a final opportunity to decline you as a host).

Is it maybe time to get off Reddit and go apologise to your daughter so you can all move on?", "I'm not trying to dog on you, but how did this not occur to you as an option? I'm truly trying to understand your thought process. Is it that you just never do anything without the kids?

My parents frequently had adult-only parties that me and my siblings were not invited to. We'd quickly grab a plate of food when my parents told us we could or my parents would order us a pizza and we'd happily stay in our rooms, hang out, and watch TV.
