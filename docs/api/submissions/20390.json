I'm pretty sure of that.\n\nThis isn't taking someone's pencil box.  The brother stole the bike.  It doesn't matter the condition the bike was in when he brought it back.  He stole it.  Yeah, he does need to have a little chit chat with the police.", "The police will say bad boy as others have undoubtedly already said.  Then the police will say where did you leave the keys, by the way?  And then nothing else will happen.  Because regardless of our overdeveloped sense of fairness, literally no harm was done.

What do you think the police will do in a situation where no harm has been done?", "No he just went to his room and later to work without saying anything", "That's the thing - this sub is about moral judgements. Legally, of course OP isn't wrong to report the theft, but morally it depends.", "I think the police will speak to him and spook him at the very least. There has to be some consequence to someone stealing no matter if there was no harm because you don't want to set the precedent that you can be stolen from and nothing will happen.", "The fact he did not apologize or ask you what he could do to make it right,   gives  you  confirmation that you did the right thing.

If you were mad, be a man, and tell the kid exactly why you were angry, why what he did was dumb, and that if he ever does it again you will get the law involved.  It was your job to teach that kid something in that situation.  Calling the cops was a weak move.  You may as well end your relationship now, because her family will never like you, and that will put stress on it in so many ways.

But to advocate for a break-up (and all the adverse effects of that), 'in case' a particular scenario happens in the future (that you actually have nowhere approaching certainty of) - it's ridiculous. \n\nI don't know if it's coming from an unrealistic sense of entitlement, that partners must be 100% perfect (and with 0% risk) to be 'deserving' of you.
