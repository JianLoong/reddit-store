The idiot brother should know not to take them because they don't belong to him.", "You sound like one of those people who\u2019d blame someone defending their home from a burglar or worse for the injuries incurred to the perpetrator.

Do you care about your relationship with your neighbors?  Wouldn't the police just say looks like you've got it back with no harm so the situation is resolved?  Are we third graders here?", "Yep, the police will say bad boy, you shouldn't have done that, and they're right.  And then it will be over.

I'm pretty sure of that.\n\nThis isn't taking someone's pencil box.  The brother stole the bike.  It doesn't matter the condition the bike was in when he brought it back.  He stole it.  Yeah, he does need to have a little chit chat with the police.", "The police will say bad boy as others have undoubtedly already said.  Then the police will say where did you leave the keys, by the way?  And then nothing else will happen.  Because regardless of our overdeveloped sense of fairness, literally no harm was done.

Yes, gf's brother is clearly an AH for stealing OP's bike, but it doesn't sound like he got into an accident, or did any damage to the bike. Involving the police in a case like this is a bit like calling the police because he had taken your bicycle for a ride without permission. It's annoying, it's technically theft, but it's not worth a criminal record.\n\nSpeeding is a crime too, but we don't report our family members to the police for speeding.

If they died or even damaged the bike that's a thing that needs to be dealt with.  Since neither of those things happened there literally has been no harm.  What do you think the police will do in a situation where no harm has been done?", "No he just went to his room and later to work without saying anything", "That's the thing - this sub is about moral judgements. Legally, of course OP isn't wrong to report the theft, but morally it depends.", "I think the police will speak to him and spook him at the very least. There has to be some consequence to someone stealing no matter if there was no harm because you don't want to set the precedent that you can be stolen from and nothing will happen.", "The fact he did not apologize or ask you what he could do to make it right,   gives  you  confirmation that you did the right thing.  Without intervention, next time it will be a car, or money,or something else he wants but doesnt have.\n\nBut at least you have a clean conscience that you took action in an effort to make him be accountable for his actions", "Yup - with no long-term (or even short-term, really) consequences of his actions, and none negative on the OP, this is very much a case of \"where on the variated grey landscape does this fall, and where are the relevant lines?\".\n\nOn that basis, things are a bit unclear - OP was trespassed against (using the more general meaning), certainly, but suffered no tangible harm.\n\nThey are certainly entitled to seek legal process for the statutory breach, but one needs to address the why of it. And that isn't explained in the post.\n\nOP apparently feels justified in reporting the issue to the police, but it's difficult to see why - something is missing.", "Yeah I wouldn't recommend being associated with a family with such weak morals... the fact that your girlfriend isnt 100% on your side tells you a lot about her characters and spoiler: its nothing good!", "My friend took a fry off my plate without asking. Should i also report her to the authorities?\n\nWhen I'm at my parents, i help myself to a glass of water.... Or maybe even a coffee.", "To characterize it as \"stolen\" isn't something the police will pander to.  If the intent is to return it it's not theft by law.  He took it for a ride.

With the brother living in Germany, and stealing the bike as OP and girlfriend visited him (and other family) in Germany. I don't know. \n\nBut I still tend towards the first interpretation (the brother stealing it in the home country, whilst OP was abroad in Germany) - mainly because there's not many people who actually take their motorbikes abroad with them (if OP had been visiting Germany, with the brother stealing the bike in Germany). \nWe could use some clarification, however.", "[removed]", "OP doesn't actually mention his gf's attitude towards this, though.
