He could have smeared himself -- or an innocent person -- all over the tarmac.\n\nTell your GF's family that enabling an idiot to commit crime -- hello theft, driving uninsured, driving without a license -- is a true d\\*ck move. They are idiots and you should NOT breed with anyone in that bloodline, OP.\n\nNTA", "Obvious NTA but...  Ensure the keys are never accessible in the future to prevent this kind of thing.\n\nTo be clear, he's 100% to blame, but you can still ensure no one can do this in the future by keeping keys inaccessible.", "Hopefully will be the last time because you taught him a lesson his family wouldn\u2019t.", "No apology at all, he actually seemed proud of himself", ">Did he give you a genuine apology? Did it seem like a one-off stupid move, or something that he could have reasonably thought you would be OK with?\n\nNone of that matters.  The dipshit took the motorcycle without permission.  That's called stealing.  Who would be responsible for damages if he wrecked it, or hit a pedestrian while driving it?", "She was mad at first but now she feels bad for him", "NTA This is why people are getting worse always zero consequences. He litrally stole the bike to take it for a ride thats both bloody dangerous and illegal he deserves what he gets maybe the CONSEQUENCES will teach him not to do it again.", "Orrrrr, bear with me here, orrrr the idiot brother doesn't take something doesn't belong to him without permission????", "The girlfriend doesn't own the bike.  She didn't have the authority to give permission to her idiot brother to take it.  You're also assuming she's involved.", "plus probably speeding", "NTA then, you don't take someone's car or bike then act shocked when that person gets pissed.\n\nSounds like this guy could do with learning a few life lessons before he makes another stupid mistake with the wrong person.\n\nUnfortunately I'm willing to bet his family won't see reason, and will still blame you.", "Then NTA. \n\nIn general I give people the benefit of the doubt once and once only, but if they seem proud of doing the stupid thing, then they deserve the consequences.", "Yeah, NTA.\n\nI could see if he made a dumb mistake and then apologized profusely. I probably would have reported it but I absolutely find no fault in you reporting it.", "It kind of matters. \n\nThe kid was stupid for taking the bike regardless. That much is undeniable. He should face consequences to learn his mistake and not do it again.\n\nBut, the difference between a criminal record for a good kid making an out of character stupid mistake.\n\nVs. \n\na spoilt brat who doesn't care, getting an important lesson.\n\nIs huge.\n\nOf course he seems like the later,  but if he was the former maybe there could be other options", "Leave her.", "OK, so NTA for reporting him, but you may be an asshole to yourself for not thinking long-term. Your girlfriend's family hates you and she is upset for her brother. Where do you go from here? I mean, are you OK with the possibility of your wife's family holding a grudge against you forever, so that perhaps you won't be welcome at family events? And all things being equal, do you think she'll want to move forward with this potentially massive baggage?\n\nPeople on this sub are so focused on their decisions in the moment. It's important to always ask \"What's next?\"", "Petty.", "Yup, it sounds like he took it without permission.  Somehow apparently he had access to the keys.  And no harm was done.  The solution is to not give further access to the keys.  Engaging authorities is just misuse of that resource for a petty squabble.", "ofc, goes without saying ;-)", "Well if she wants to break up because of this then it wasn\u2019t \u201cmeant to be\u201d as cringy as it sounds. And I\u2019m not really big on family gatherings anyway so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f it is what it is i guess (that does sound like I\u2019m an asshole, I\u2019m aware)", "I disagree with the argument that it is bad for the long term relationship. Thinking long term, gf should be ok with OP putting down some boundaries which would keep him from being a doormat to her family. If there is a future with them, they need to know he isn't ok with having future BIL perform risky behavior which also holds OP liable. \n\nIt was OP's decision how to move forward with the incident because he was the one wronged. GF & fam could *hope* he didn't report it, but that isn't their choice to make.", "Not petty at all.  He DID steal the bike and he should have some sort of consequences for that.  I don't get to walk into a bank and take $10,000 just because I want the money.", "OP can keep the keys wherever he wants.  He shouldn't have to hide them.  The idiot brother should know not to take them because they don't belong to him.", "You sound like one of those people who\u2019d blame someone defending their home from a burglar or worse for the injuries incurred to the perpetrator. Maybe the brother had access because everyone, OP included, thought that the brother wouldn\u2019t break trust and do something like this?", "Not an asshole. Don\u2019t waste your time in this relationship.", "The idea of laws is to protect people from harm.  No harm was done here.  In a civil case there would be no case.  It's silly (and very petty) to engage the legal system in a situation with literally no harm.", "No doubt.  And the brother for sure did something he shouldn't have (duh).  But it's OVER and NO HARM was done.  Now they know not to leave the keys near the brother.  I have no idea why anyone would want to punish someone for something that literally did no harm.  So weird and, dare I say, petty.", "Not at all.  But if someone said someone got into my house, using the keys I left in their vicinity, and did no harm ... I'd tell them to change their locks and move on with their lives.  What the brother did was wrong, but since it didn't result in harm the police will not do anything beyond perhaps a chat.", "Stealing property is harming the person who owns said property.  So if I take my neighbor's but bring it back without a scratch on it, does that mean I shouldn't get in trouble for taking something that isn't mine?", "Or the OP leaves his keys wherever he wants, and the police put the fear of God into the dipshit about stealing other people's property.", "Did you leave your neighbors with the keys?  Do you care about your relationship with your neighbors?  Wouldn't the police just say looks like you've got it back with no harm so the situation is resolved?  Are we third graders here?", "Yep, the police will say bad boy, you shouldn't have done that, and they're right.  And then it will be over.  So what was the value of that chat?", "And if the OP leaves their keys near him again, and he takes it again?  Shame on who?", "OP didn't leave the keys with the UNLICENSED brother. I'm pretty sure of that.\n\nThis isn't taking someone's pencil box.  The brother stole the bike.  It doesn't matter the condition the bike was in when he brought it back.  He stole it.  Yeah, he does need to have a little chit chat with the police.", "The police will say bad boy as others have undoubtedly already said.  Then the police will say where did you leave the keys, by the way?  And then nothing else will happen.  Because regardless of our overdeveloped sense of fairness, literally no harm was done.  So that will be the end of it.  Which is good, because there are actual crimes that those resources should go to."]}
