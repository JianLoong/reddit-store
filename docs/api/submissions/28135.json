It\u2019s not fair to put even more stress on a person who is already mentally ill.

I recommend therapy for you as I only want the best for you.\u201d \n\nSomething like that, because at the end of the day it is still effecting you so you need to get out of that relationship, but don\u2019t say, go to therapy or I\u2019m leaving.
