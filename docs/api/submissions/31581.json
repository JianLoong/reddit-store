Better to have little contact, instead of bitterness and jealousy coloring everything.

That's going to be a tough hill for you to get over.", "NAH.  I bet no one casting judgment here grew up as poor as you did.  You\u2019re entitled to all your feelings.

He's a good bud, but we don't have much of a relationship yet because I moved out when he was born, and then half a world away from my parents. Twice. I simply cannot be around them yet. I'm still processing.\n\nI recently had a long conversation with my stepdad that he feels that my brother might be lonely, not like other kids and really sees me as someone interesting, even from afar. That he's worried for him fitting in life.\n\nAnd conceptually - I get it. I even think there will be a relationship in future. But truth is - we have COMPLETELY different lives and parents, even if we share a mom and my stepdad was in my life for 2 decades. They were not the same people even 10 years ago - \"mental health doesn't exist\". Now they at least ask me what a therapist even does.\n\nI was straight up bullied for not just 'sucking it up like everyone else'. For having nervous breakdowns. For having hard time staying employed/in school because of crippling lifelong anxiety. For being lonely (get your ass out there and get a husband already). Bullied and shamed then for finally finding reprieve in having a dog. And now they are worried my brother doesn't fit in and doesn't have enough friends. I wasn't ever allowed to bring people home.\n\nOf course those are unrelated. Of course I wouldn't take it out on my bro.\n\nBut NTA because you (and I) still need to process and establish our own selves before we're ready to give. Ultimately you paren't cannot redo your childhood with different circumstances, but you don't owe them exact amount of affection either. It's no surprise relationships work best jumping a generation (aka grandparents give love better than parents).", "NAH. With this kind of age difference, your parents must have been extremely young when they had you. As an adult, you should be more focused on whether or not your parents did the best they could given who they were, and not just what they had. Should a child be raised in poverty? No, but was there love? Was there support and understanding? Your parents are in a better place now. Don't miss out on a relationship with your sibling because of the past. Therapy and time can resolve this kind of anger.", "I genuinely feel you not the asshole. The emotions you feel are only relatable to people who have been in your shoes. \nBut you need to get therapy for the resentment and work hard for your life.", "NTA you are 32 so I\u2019m not sure what kind of a bond you can have to a baby as his brother. You have a complete separate life from your parents so I\u2019m not sure other than visiting them every once in a while what else there is. I\u2019m not entirely sure what\u2019s expected of you? I mean you don\u2019t have to be hateful towards a baby but you won\u2019t be bff\u2019s either", "NTA for how you're feeling and wanting to protect yourself.\n\nBut in the long run you'll be cutting off your family and be even more isolated and just let your hate fester. Cutting them off may be for the best or maybe it won't, but you won't know for sure until you get therapy.", "I don't get the Y t A votes.

You don\u2019t own your parents anything. And frankly, your dad seems like AH here by looking at the way he acts.", "As it sits now, NTA.  There are too many things left out.  Like since the business has taken off have your parents offered to help you in any way?  How was/is your relationship with your parents before the baby announcement?  I have a feeling that it was not in the best place to begin with.  You have the right to resentment, feelings that your parents did not and have not done well for you.  And you are correct in one of your statements that if you resent their child it will not be healthy for him.  You need to fix your relationship with your parents before you have a relationship with their child.", "NTA. You are entitled to your feelings. You aren\u2019t an AH for feeling this way and neither are your parents. But seriously though, are you going to cut ties with your parents forever ? Is that your plan ? Are you going to disappear just like that ?", "NAH: if you\u2019re 32 and you\u2019re mom is currently pregnant, she had to have had you INCREDIBLY young  and I assume they did their very best.

I just hope you have thought of any ramifications that could come in the long term.", "Not exactly the same, but I had a family member who hurt me deeply.

I figured the kid is young, I have some time to heal through therapy and try to get to a better place before interacting with them regularly. I was worried about my resentments and feelings traumatizing the kid.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be around them until after a few years therapy, and barely interacted with the kid until they were around age five. Now, while we don\u2019t have a super close relationship, I am glad that I stayed away until I had better management of my feelings. And our relationship has only grown through time because each time, we are able to have positive and fun interactions. \n\nIf you are able to step back a bit, perhaps going to therapy and trying to process your feelings will be helpful. If you don\u2019t want to lose your parents, and they truly didn\u2019t abuse or traumatize you, then you do bear responsibility for doing the work to process your feelings so you can be around your parents and this child without hurting them with your resentment/anger. Perhaps, for your own health it is helpful to go to therapy regardless of how you want to handle your family.\n\nGood luck.", "INFO: Are you parents better off than you at the moment, if so, have they done anything to try to improve the standard of your life?\n\nI would say NTA, I know there are all the people here saying that you should be happy that your brother is having a better life but at the end of the day, you need to look after your own well being.", "NTA \n\nYou don't owe them a god damn thing.", "NTA.

In all honesty, as a parent myself, one of the things I would be doing if I were the newly successful parents would be to have sat down with OP and had an honest discussion of what OP went through and tried to balance the equation by helping OP monetarily somehow.  I would have said, \"You missed out on the childhood that your brother is going to have.  We can't re-write history and make you have a better childhood, but we would like to acknowledge that by \\[saving some money for you, too\\], \\[helping pay for some property for OP\\]\".  But something.  Unequal treatment sews resentment among siblings.\n\nI have seen people live through what OP did, and the parents have made it right - and the siblings and parents together all have tight relationships.", "NTA. \n\nPurely for age gap alone I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting a relationship with your brother. 32 years is way too long of a gap for any meaningful sibling relationship to be had. At best, you\u2019d be a fun uncle, but you\u2019ll never really be that child\u2019s brother. I agree with others that you should look into therapy though, purely for your own sake of moving on.", "NTA. OP can decide whether to be a part of his brother's and parent's life or not. It is completely up to him. No one is forced into having a relationship with anyone. Given the circumstances, the parents should also be understanding to not rub it into OP's face, when they already know of his feelings. Why is the dad calling for the baby's names? Why are the parents rubbing it into OP's face about all of the ways they can provide for a baby now when they couldn't for OP? Like, come on and read the room. Was there any incentive that OP received after the gathering businesses took off to make up for it all? There is resentment and family and individual therapy is needed. Plus if anything happened to the baby the expectation is that OP will take care of him and even pick up the parenting slack as the parents are aging now. The parents are jerks talking about breaking hearts and causing stress. It is manipulation! OP do what you need to do boundaries-wise for peace. Do not become parentified. I will say that it isn't your brother's fault and you can still have a relationship with him, as he ages, that doesn't need to involve your parents.", "Tbh, I don't think you're TA. Not in the slightest bit. I grew up the oldest out of 5 kids living in the home. My older brother lived elsewhere since he has a different Dad than all of us.\n\n I graduated high school the same year my parents got divorced, and not long after, I moved out. After that, most of my siblings got to have a better high school experience than me. When my parents were still together, I wasn't allowed to do much at all. We didn't have a lot of money, none that our parents were willing to give us when we had needs, there was physical violence done towards all of us, nobody went to the Doctor's, and unlike all my siblings, I had to fight to even go to the Dentist for an abcessed tooth that was causing my face to swell up. My Mom had several appointments scheduled to try and get all of my teeth fixed before she temporarily left, and my Dad forced me to cancel every one of them despite the pain i was in. Moving for the 10th time was more important. That was the first time I had gone to a dentist in 18 years of my life. \n\nThat changed for my siblings once Step parents entered the picture, and Dad didn't want to look like an a-hole. Just months after having to sacrifice my Senior field trip to Silverwood in order to convince my lame Dad to let me get it pulled at least, every one of my siblings living in Montana got unnecessary braces, glasses, piercings hairdos, electronic devices I wasn't even allowed to have, etc. I didn't talk to my Dad for a few years after moving out and only reached out just last year just to talk to my siblings, still living there. I don't resent my siblings, but I know what it's like to feel resentful towards your parents for not having the best start in life, especially knowing how hard life is.\n\nOn top of that, you don't owe your parents free babysitting. I'm surprised at how many people are calling you an A hole. Shows how many either grew up privileged or they're like those parents. You're entitled to your feelings as they are very valid.

You should be happy that your brother won't have to experience life the way you did. Would you prefer your parents still living in poverty?

To read on and discover that it's a late life child of your parents was a bit surprising.\n\nThis isn't about risking your mental health, it's just raging, unchecked, undeserved jealousy. You've grown up as an only child from the sound of it, and you're pissed that you're not anymore.\n\nI've got news for you, sure you didn't grow up with a lot of money, and you watched your parents struggle. Things have improved for them financially and THAT pisses you off. A couple of things that you need to recognize about your childhood are that you HAD a good home, even if it was a financially limited one, and you HAD parents that truly love you. Some of us never had either. Consider yourself lucky.\n\nYou need therapy. You resented your parents just for bring you into this world, you resent them more now because their business became successful and now you're jealous of your sibling (whom I can't tell if they're born yet or not) because of that.\n\nPull your head out of your ass and stop acting like a spoiled, resentful 2 year old.\n\nYTA", "YTA - I grew up in a condemned home with mold on the walls and no heat.

Yes, it sucks for your parents to do better after you\u2019re adult, but it\u2019s not their fault and it\u2019s not yours or the new baby. Life sucked as a kid, true, but when you\u2019re young and get married, the pressure is to have kids. \n\nCutting your parents off (if they were abusive, please cut them off), for being poor when you were little then improving their circumstances is cruel at best.", "Okay, I'm confused. How is his mother having a baby?  OP says they're 32. Making the wild assumption that his mother was in her teens when he was born, she would be in her late 40s if not 50 by now.

You are mad that your parents worked their asses off to raise you and finally are doing semi okay enough to have another child... And you resent them for it? WTF! From what you've said, this wasn't even a planned pregnancy. You have no idea how this could impact their future, her health (pregnancy is a life threatening condition).

Turning your back on this situation won't change it. The facts are that your parents did their best with you, even if that didn't live up to what you or they had hoped for. They will do their best with their new child too, and because of circumstances beyond their control, that will look different than what their best with you did. That doesn't mean that they love you any less, and it doesn't mean that they were abusive to bring you into the world when they couldn't afford as much.\n\nIf you have such serious issues with your parents and their decision to have you in less than idea circumstances, I concur with those who are suggesting therapy. This has nothing to do with a future sibling, and everything to do with your needing to process your anger and grief. Perhaps a therapist will be able to help you express these feelings to your parents in a more constructive way, so that you can all move forward together. Or maybe you will determine you don't want any further contact with them, and that's a valid decision as well. You've said you'll lower contact while your mother is pregnant, but you know that's not the final answer, right? Your sibling will be around for the foreseeable future, and ignoring them while trying to have a relationship with your parents is not going to go over well with any of you.\n\nWhat it sounds like, to me, is that you're upset that your parents will be giving another child things they were not in a position to give you- not that they didn't want to, but that they couldn't. It sounds like your parents still love and support you, and want you to be part of their joy. It also sounds like you would rather be mad at them for being successful too late for you than find a way to share their happiness. This is your prerogative, but I can't help but feel sorry for you for choosing to sit in your misery alone rather than trying to find a new path forward together. You can't go back and change your childhood. You can find new happiness in adulthood. You can close a difficult chapter of your life and open a fresh one. Or you can decide seeing another child getting everything you ever wanted is too painful and go away. Or you can fight about it with your parents, but I hope you don't choose this option because really, that's just stressful for everyone, including you.\n\nSo, back to the question: what do you want your endgame to be?", "YTA\n\nYour language really says a lot here, your dad\u2019s family?

Write it out, blast angry music, go on long runs, whatever you find that lets you work through this shit, process it in a healthy way, and finally drop it like the steaming deuce it is..  For your own sake.  \n\nYTA, but I hope you figure this out.  Being this bitter is no way to live.", "YTA.

No one can force you to be part of the baby\u2019s (or your parents\u2019) life but really think about it before you make rash decisions.

The first is obviously preferable, but I would argue that the OP knows more about the situation than us and if he feels that the second is the better fit for him in maintaining the good space he\u2019s worked to get himself to, then his parents should respect that.\n\nAlso, the OP isn\u2019t an AH for resenting his parents because they were poor and couldn\u2019t provide for him.  It wasn\u2019t their fault that they couldn\u2019t.  They did the best they could.  He missed out.  He\u2019s angry about that.

He can resent them for his childhood even if they did the best they could.  It sounds like they were absolutely victims of circumstance.

So while working through all the resentment to try to resolve it would be ideal, in the absence of that, why isn\u2019t avoiding a situation that the OP is self aware enough to know will cause resentment to build the next best thing?

There\u2019s a best way, but that doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s on the table, so what we\u2019re being asked is whether this other way that isn\u2019t as good is an AH way.\n\nAnd I\u2019m (obviously) firmly in the no camp.

Especially perhaps a young couple with a business they\u2019re hoping might take off soon. \n\nI mean take a moment and try to think about people who\u2019s lives and circumstances might be a little different from your own and attempt some basic empathy for the parents *in addition* to the OP. \n\nLife isn\u2019t a zero sum game. There aren\u2019t always villains even when things are shitty. There\u2019s a reason the NAH verdict exists.", "I personally know someone whose oldest and youngest were 31 years apart. Three girls. First two were planned (first and second husband), the third most definitely was not. The mother was 49 when the last one was born.", "My dad's younger brother was born in October of this year, my dad turned 41 in August.", "Abandoning his parents abandoning his sibling(s), his selfishness, anger, resentment.  These are all horrific character traits that he is exhibiting.  Totally lacking in any kind of honor.  I second this dude needing some serious therapy.", "I'm comparing feelings to feelings, undeserved hate to undeserved hate. \nOP is an adult in his fucking 30's who's so jealous of his younger sibling that he refuses to even acknowledge him, calling his full brother \"my dad's son\".", "This is the dumbest reasoning ever. So if thru hard work you work yourself out of poverty because you were in poverty you shouldn't have kids? \n\nOP is entitled to his feelings but he needs therapy. \n\nAnd poverty isnt always due to shit choices.", "Considering he is calling him his \"father's son\" isntead of his brother I would say it looks more like resent", "It's not a happy do over fantasy. It's a real life happy birth of a child, they aren't playing house just to hurt OPs feelings.", "Yippie!", "How are you so sure that they haven't helped OP financially? I can't help but notice that's the one question OP won't respond to in this thread despite it having been asked several times.", "How?  What is the monetary level that they need to give to OP to make up for the fact that AT THE TIME they didn\u2019t have the ability to give him the Norman Rockwell upbringing?  Do you think they should play poor with the new kid?  Make him/her live a life of poverty to make it even?", "He did ask, but still, he can choose if he wants a relationship at the end of the day.", "How is he asshole for that? He has right to live his own life in his own terms and there\u2019s nothing asshole-ish about that. His father is the one who acted like AH here, he could have had actual conversation with OP after he declined, but instead goes calling him bitter and this \u201dbig brother he knows he could be\u201d is an assumptation that he has no right to make, how does that take OP\u2019s feelings i to consideration?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t own his parents nor his unborn sibling anything. If anything, OP is adult and allowed to do his own decisions and like I said, that doesn\u2019t make him AH.", "I didn't say his trauma is invalid, I said his behavior is wrong.", "Actually, that's not clear.  Could you rephrase?", "Some people just want to create stories in their head and it doesn\u2019t matter what the actual story says.", "I don't need to provide counter evidence of what you consider a fair assumption because you had nothing to back it up in the first place.", "By the same mother, though?", "He's not abandoning - he's withdrawing.  Which he is entitled to do.", "He is free to abandon every single person in his life if he chooses to, irrelevant of reason, as long as they are not reliant on him. He could simply not like them as people and that\u2019s more than good enough to dip from every single one of their lives if that\u2019s what would make him happy. \n\nSo sick of this \u201cleaving family is dishonourable\u201d bullshit. They fucked each other and birthed him in shit, then realised \u201chuh, being poor and ignored isn\u2019t conducive to a good/happy childhood. Whoops, better wait with the next one lol\u201d fuck off. He is free to flip the bird and never speak to any of them again if that\u2019s genuinely what would be good for his mental health. \n\nHe should get therapy so that he can decipher if it\u2019s truly in his best interest emotionally and financially to be completely alone or whether working on these feelings and moving on are best for him though. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s up to no-one but him, if he really feels like he cant get past their wilful ignorance of their financial state when having him then it\u2019s right that he leave. Him continuing to feel this way and be involved in the family is only a recipe for another unhappy childhood. The fact he is acutely aware of this and actively asking for advice means this guy should be slapped with a \u201cway more fucking honourable than most people\u201d sticker because he\u2019s STILL considering everyone else.\n\nYou suck at empathy, and I\u2019m willing to bet didn\u2019t have a poor childhood.", "Them calling him bitter and telling him to get over his negative childhood experiences while also insisting/demanding he play an active happy/positive older brother role to their do over baby is delusional.\n\nShould I be happy that my sister I'm NC with is apparently planning a 3rd child even though the existing 2 are mostly ignored by her? People having babies isn't always a positive thing for those around them.", "> He has right to live his own life in his own terms\n\nSure\n\n>and there\u2019s nothing asshole-ish about that. \n\nThat obviously depends on what those terms are. And he has chosen asshole ones", "What behavior? He really haven\u2019t did anything but distance his self which is valid response. He never disrespected anybody.", "Ok, than if you are not willing to say how you think I was wrong I can't really say much more about it can I?", "No, different mother", "He is entitled to do... almost anything.  But some of the things he might do would make him an AH.  Including cutting off family for getting wealthy a little too late for his taste.", "Yes, he's absolutely entitled to be an asshole. He's exercising that right.", "You could have just said \"he's free to be a bitter asshole\" and wasted a lot less effort", "Don't bring your experiences into this, be objective.   \nOP has trauma and that is legitimate. His parents are having a baby and are going to give the new baby the *same thing* they gave OP: *everything they possibly could.* They want him to be an active part of their family. He doesn't want to because he feels this kid is getting more than he got - that's jealousy. That's the green monster preventing him from engaging with his family. It's not delusional for me to imagine someone overcoming their childhood trauma in order to participate in their evolving family of origin's lives.", "And what makes those terms \u201dasshole ones\u201d hmm? Care to clarify?", "Distancinh himself because he grew up poor, resenting a baby because he won't", "Correct.", "That's not an accurate summary of the situation, but it also doesn't surprise me.", "So, people who do not feel they are treated equitably by their family and lower their contact are now assholes?", "It's not jealousy to distance yourself from people who dismiss your experiences. I was referring to the parents as being delusional to expect him to want to be part of their new dynamic when they don't have any respect for him.\n\nMy experiences enlighten my point of view just as yours dismiss OP's complex feelings surrounding his parents and encourage him to only think of his impending sibling's feelings, believing that to be \"overcoming trauma\" instead of being detrimental to OP's mental health.", "I don't need to.
