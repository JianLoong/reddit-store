You didn't even really notice that you didn't spend as much time with him as you wanted, until he texted you saying so? Do you have any opinions or thoughts of your own? Also, the fact that your friend was in your wedding does not mean that he has any relationship with your wife or children.\n\nHowever, I just wanted to say, the trip you envisioned having, where your kids get to hang out in the backyard of a random person they don't know, while the adults have sad mourning time with a dying individual? That was every \"family vacation\" of my childhood, and it SUCKED. The only time we went anywhere was to visit my father's side of the family across the country, and the kids were expected to play in the backyard all day while all the adults talked and caught up. And one of the older adults was always either very ill or dying and it very awkward and uncomfortable. And yes, it was also boring as hell. Sometimes we'd get to do a fun thing on one or two of the \"vacation\" days but moslty it was just a week of hanging out with dying relatives we had little to no relationship with.\n\nLike pretty much every other commenter has said, if you want to go see your friend, take a trip to do that on your own.

She told you up front she did not want to fly out there to spend a lot of time with your friend as a family.

I can guess: you don't think they'll be met anyway and being upset and resentful is a frequent state of being for you. Perhaps being upset, put out, and feeling like a martyr feels familiar and even a bit comfortable to you at this point\n- you and your wife have a very different understanding of the phrase \"as much time as possible\"\n\nI am guessing you think your wife runs the family and you feel your wants and desires are not being considered by her enough.\n\nHave you considered you aren't actually being clear enough or straight forward enough about your true expectations? And when people inevitably fail to meet those expectations, you get sad and passive aggressive? Do you say you're fine when you aren't?\n\nIf I can impart anything to you, *you get what you want by being clear about it*. Just because something is Very Important to you doesn't mean it is Very Important to everyone around you. It may feel obvious to you that \"as much time as possible\" with your friend meant a few days' visit but your wife also has to take her needs and the kids' needs into consideration on the *family vacation*.\n\nPeople are not mind readers.

Half a day is plenty when your only there for a week tbh on a FAMILY vacation.", "You should have just stayed over at your friend's. What's she gonna do, ground you?", "Because he wanted it to coincide with the family trip which is being paid for him by his wife. Get it?", "Ya just take extra time off work and leave your wife with the kids, its the perfect solution with no downsides.", "Yup.  Every family vacation I had as a kid was driving halfway across the country to visit my paternal extended family for a week.   Yes, I loved my grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins - but it was a long drive that my dad usually did straight through and then slept for a full day afterwards.  We always stayed with my grandparents and did the same things; all the family who lived there went about their days normally.  \n\nOn the way home we'd stop somewhere interesting for an overnight to break the trip up, and those are the parts of the \"family vacations\" that my brother and I actually remember, and enjoyed!  The bulk of the trips were just incredibly boring.", "Thank you! I saw someone saying that as a kid they spent time at strangers'houses and sucked it up, they're for sure talking about doing that in their day-to-day life, not on holiday. Holidays are supposed to be fun, doing stuff you couldn't or wouldn't usually do at home. \n\nNot to mention that being around terminally ill strangers is awkward AF at any age (unless you work in medicine or hospice care). What was his wife who paid for the trip out of her own pocket supposed to do, sit on the couch and watch TV? Awkwardly catch up with HIS friend? \n\nVisiting a terminally ill friend of one family member is not a family activity. It's an individual activity", "Which he can still do mind you.", "I'm impressed about how well you worded this. OP's whole profile shows a big lack in communication skills. Some folk don't really understand that they are the ones stopping themselves from being happy and are too quickly blaming the people around them, which can lead to feeling like they're a passive bystander in their own life. The way you communicated that to OP was excellent. I hope OP reads your comment and does a little self reflecting. He could be so much happier if he followed your advice.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "I think one of the problems here is that OP is to passive   to know what his boundaries, needs and wants are. \n\nHe only realised he didn't get enough time with his friend after the trip, when the friend told him so. He during the trip, which he didn't seem to help plan at all, he seemed to be fine with the plans. \n\nOP, why is your wife in charge of planning vacation? Is she in charge of a lot of the planning for your family?", "He shouldn't have to though. A loving and caring partner would understand and, if the main bread earner, finance the partners time to spend with their close friend. They could've still had a good holiday and allowed him more time to spend with said friend\n\nSo NTA. I guarantee if the roles were reversed, you'd also be saying NTA\n\nThere's literally no reason for it to be anything other than NTA", "I would go with YTA, maybe if he had helped to plan the trip, then he could have made room for the visit. As far as I can tell he both expected his wife to pay for and plan the trip and accommodate his needs instead of the families. I don't think OP's request to visit his dying friend was in any way too much, but it seems like he could have been a lot more proactive in making it happen.", "Whining mostly", "Except he\u2019s not? His comment history is just complaints and bashing his wife for things he could have and should have been doing that he off loaded onto her. A ton of people suggested taking a separate trip to visit his friend. OP\u2019s only response is that it would be too hard to fly two hours one weekend to dedicate time to his DYING friend and that he\u2019d rather do it during a family vacation he left his wife to plan and pay for.", "Literally gender doesn\u2019t matter here and neither does who paid. OP sold it to his wife as a family vacation where he wanted to see a dying friend. It\u2019s what he got. \n\nIt was a week long vacation with two days of traveling. From what it seems he got 20% of the vacation which is fair considering he\u2019s only 20% of the family. The fact that he wasn\u2019t clearer isn\u2019t his wife\u2019s fault. However the fact that he tried to mislead, didn\u2019t plan, and knew nothing about the activities but wants to blame his wife for that shows insane incompetence/ immaturity . He\u2019s TA for that alone, but the blame he shifts onto his wife for not being his mom in his post history takes the cake.", "He could do some of the planning himself instead of leaving it up to her to magically read his mind and make his dreams come true. \nAre you dense to the actual mental load of preparing the logistics for a family vacation with three preteens? Balancing everyones needs with the vague expectations of your spouse that's only thinking about what he wants.", "So she has to plan and pay for the vacation entirely on her own , but now she also has to watch the kids entirely on her own on a FAMILY vacation so dad can visit a friend that he clearly doesn\u2019t care enough about to book a short plane ride to go see on his own time? Wack as hell, he seems like such a useless husband.", "It  was a FAMILY vacation. I wouldn\u2019t want to have to plan and pay for an entire vacation along with taking on the load of watching 3 pre teens so that my husband can relax and hang out with a friend that he clearly doesn\u2019t care enough about to book his own separate trip to visit. A family vacation implies that it\u2019s time to be spent with family, not with dads Sick friend. I also think it\u2019s strange that no one has pointed out that that might not be a suitable situation for the sick friend either. If im terminally ill then the last thing I probably want is 5 people, 3 of those being kids,imposing themselves on my house for multiple days on end. That sounds exhausting for the friend as well! \nIf he actually cared that much about his friend he would book a separate weekend trip to visit him without the wife and kids, so that they could visit for ample time and so his friend wouldn\u2019t have to take on the stress of hosting/entertaining 5 people in his home while also being sick. OP is inconsiderate to his wife and children and to his sick friend.", "I am so confused. How is it not easy? I get that it might be difficult to afford or get time off but I really think you should be fighting to get a weekend off.", "And you spent some time with him. Where\u2019s the problem?", "I live in NJ and it\u2019s not that serious to go to CO for a four day weekend - you just want an excuse to not put in the work and blame your wife.", "as someone who spent a lot of time being bored at strangers houses as a kid i think they could have sucked it up. the house had a pool, likely a tv and internet spending two or three afternoons at someone\u2019s house because they are i\u2019ll seems perfectly reasonable to me", "12 hours on a 7 day trip is quite a lot. How much more time did you want to spend there? You do have children who think they're on a family vacation. You really think it's fun for them to spend time at a house of someone they don't know? Like don't plan these types of things into a family vacation if you want to allocate more than 12 hours on it. Go by yourself.", "So you got to spend about a day's worth of activity time with your friend in a 7 day trip. If I assume an hr a meal, 3 meals a day, and 8hrs sleep a day, that averages to about 13hrs a day for activities, travel time, and hygiene. If you wanted more than a day, you should have planned for a solo trip and not used a family vacation. YTA.", "12 hours is essentially a full day if you wanted more then you should\u2019ve planned your own trip to see him", "So you literally didn't even think it was too little time, expect in the aftermath where the entire thing suddenly becomes your wife's fault? She didn't foresee the future well enough for you?", "Bloody hell, man up. You\u2019re quite happy to go on vacations that you\u2019ve contributed nothing to, and now you have the audacity to make out you\u2019re the downtrodden man being pushed around by the controlling wife.", "When a dying friend says he wishes you\u2019d had more time together, he means that he doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left - I\u2019m sure he wishes he had more time to spend with a lot of people. He\u2019s not criticizing you because he thinks you didn\u2019t spend enough time with him on your family vacation. I\u2019m very sorry about your friend but you\u2019re unfairly taking your grief out on your wife.", "Are you married to my husband??", "This is a factor to why I lost interest in an ex. Getting them to do anything at all was difficult enough, worsened by their inability to give a solid yes, or a no. A man passive aggressively hinting at what he wants, over and over, after pulling a big indirect roundabout way of trying to ask or say something, does get annoying. \n\n\"Oh, are you SURE you wanna lay on the bed this way?

You sure?\", sir, just lay down the way you like or ask directly!!!!\n\nOr bickering with me over seats I chose because he refused to take initiative, instead of just asking the waiter for the ideal seats.

Why didn\u2019t you think/know how short the time would be? It tells us how hands off you\u2019ve been about helping plan the vacation and left it all up to your wife to do.

You are expecting your wife and kids to tailor their time and plans around someone who sounds like barely an acquaintance to them. That\u2019s selfish.", "Absolutely agree - they both work, she makes more money and yet she\u2019s the one working out the logistics and paying for their holiday. Not easily done when you have three kids. \n\nOP - why are you leaving all the planning to your wife? You wanted to go there specifically but she\u2019s the one who\u2019s organised everything?", "My husband's mom just passed away from liver cancer a month ago. It's horrific to watch. To the point that we didn't take our 13yo to see her the last two weeks of my MIL's life. It just wasn't a memory we wanted for our daughter. \n\nTaking preteens to hang out with a stranger with stage 4 liver cancer would be awful. The husband absolutely should have gone to visit by himself. That's not a family vacation type of thing.", "Exactly, this entire thing just had me wonder why she had to be the full planner. If he wanted to spend a day with his friend, he could have taken it upon himself to offer low maintenance activities for her to do with the kids while he was there, like a museum, lunch, or even have the kids relax for an afternoon at the hotel. \n\nThey are meant to be partners, but she\u2019s taking on the logistics, planning and financing of vacations, how is that a fair distribution of the work? \n\nId also be curious to know: how long was the vacation? How much time did OP want to spend with his friend? How old exactly are the triplets? Would there be no other opportunity for OP to go see his friend for a weekend to spend more time with him?", "This. If you want to say goodbye to your friend plan another trip, pay for it yourself. There is nothing holding you back. You should have thought about it more yourself too. YTA", "I 100% agree. He should have planned a separate trip to say goodbye to his friend. Also would he just not have bothered to see the friend at all if they hadn\u2019t gone on family vacation there?", "This is the answer. \n\nEven with a pool it\u2019s not really something your kids would really want to do for a couple days with a very sick stranger. It\u2019d be sad and awkward.\n\nThe solution could have been that you stayed in Colorado for a couple extra days with your friend. You wouldn\u2019t have to worry about entertaining your kids or making your wife plan the trip around this visit. Or you could\u2019ve arrived a couple days early then met up with your family.\n\nGentle YTA because you can\u2019t expect your family to hang out somewhere for 2 days of vacation. It would be distracting to you and force your friend to play host to multiple extra people.", "OP is definitely the AH. When my close mate was dying with brain cancer I planned and paid for my trip to go see him by myself. My partner had no problems about me going either. Why would you drag your whole family on a family vacation for a goodbye visit?\n\nOP needs to face up to the fact he needs to make his own trip and stop blaming his wife.", "Exactly. YTA.

Why are you deputising your grief and friendships to your wife?", "This", "Why is he not allowed to spend a day or two with his friend while she does what she wants for the vacation?\n\nWhat makes you think he even enjoys these vacations? How do you know he isn't going on them just to support his family who really wants to go?\n\nHim making less money doesn't mean he isn't allowed to do things that would be important to him when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nIf this was a woman posting this about her husband and her friend dying of breast cancer, would you say the same?

He keeps blaming it on her with comments like \u201cwell I told her I wanted time and I was surprised that I didn\u2019t get as much as I wanted\u201d.

I feel that if OP wants to accommodate time with his friend, he would need to ask about what her concerns are, then do the work of figuring out some alternative options (like inviting another family member to help her out, or looking into childcare options as some hotels have day camps for kids) and then presenting those alternatives to her and working with her so that he gets the time he wants and his kids are being entertained and his wife isn\u2019t having to manage them all by herself. \n\nInstead he seems stuck in a cycle of asking her to make things happen and then doing nothing else himself to get those things to happen.", "No. Why should the kid\u2019s family vacay get ruined because dad can\u2019t visit his friend alone and wants an all-in-one paid for by his wife? \n\nHe\u2019s not even paying.
