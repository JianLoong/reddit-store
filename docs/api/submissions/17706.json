You didn't even really notice that you didn't spend as much time with him as you wanted, until he texted you saying so? Do you have any opinions or thoughts of your own? Also, the fact that your friend was in your wedding does not mean that he has any relationship with your wife or children.\n\nHowever, I just wanted to say, the trip you envisioned having, where your kids get to hang out in the backyard of a random person they don't know, while the adults have sad mourning time with a dying individual? That was every \"family vacation\" of my childhood, and it SUCKED. The only time we went anywhere was to visit my father's side of the family across the country, and the kids were expected to play in the backyard all day while all the adults talked and caught up. And one of the older adults was always either very ill or dying and it very awkward and uncomfortable. And yes, it was also boring as hell. Sometimes we'd get to do a fun thing on one or two of the \"vacation\" days but moslty it was just a week of hanging out with dying relatives we had little to no relationship with.\n\nLike pretty much every other commenter has said, if you want to go see your friend, take a trip to do that on your own.

She told you up front she did not want to fly out there to spend a lot of time with your friend as a family.

I can guess: you don't think they'll be met anyway and being upset and resentful is a frequent state of being for you. Perhaps being upset, put out, and feeling like a martyr feels familiar and even a bit comfortable to you at this point\n- you and your wife have a very different understanding of the phrase \"as much time as possible\"\n\nI am guessing you think your wife runs the family and you feel your wants and desires are not being considered by her enough.\n\nHave you considered you aren't actually being clear enough or straight forward enough about your true expectations? And when people inevitably fail to meet those expectations, you get sad and passive aggressive? Do you say you're fine when you aren't?\n\nIf I can impart anything to you, *you get what you want by being clear about it*. Just because something is Very Important to you doesn't mean it is Very Important to everyone around you. It may feel obvious to you that \"as much time as possible\" with your friend meant a few days' visit but your wife also has to take her needs and the kids' needs into consideration on the *family vacation*.\n\nPeople are not mind readers.

Why now, just because he\u2019s sick?\n\nIf you wanna see him so much save your own money take time off work and go see him. Don\u2019t make your family vacation about you hanging with your friend. Half a day is plenty when your only there for a week tbh on a FAMILY vacation.", "You should have just stayed over at your friend's. What's she gonna do, ground you?", "Because he wanted it to coincide with the family trip which is being paid for him by his wife. Get it?", "Ya just take extra time off work and leave your wife with the kids, its the perfect solution with no downsides.", "Yup.  Every family vacation I had as a kid was driving halfway across the country to visit my paternal extended family for a week.   Yes, I loved my grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins - but it was a long drive that my dad usually did straight through and then slept for a full day afterwards.  We always stayed with my grandparents and did the same things; all the family who lived there went about their days normally.  \n\nOn the way home we'd stop somewhere interesting for an overnight to break the trip up, and those are the parts of the \"family vacations\" that my brother and I actually remember, and enjoyed!  The bulk of the trips were just incredibly boring.", "Thank you! I saw someone saying that as a kid they spent time at strangers'houses and sucked it up, they're for sure talking about doing that in their day-to-day life, not on holiday. Holidays are supposed to be fun, doing stuff you couldn't or wouldn't usually do at home. \n\nNot to mention that being around terminally ill strangers is awkward AF at any age (unless you work in medicine or hospice care). What was his wife who paid for the trip out of her own pocket supposed to do, sit on the couch and watch TV? Awkwardly catch up with HIS friend? \n\nVisiting a terminally ill friend of one family member is not a family activity. It's an individual activity", "Which he can still do mind you.", "I'm impressed about how well you worded this. OP's whole profile shows a big lack in communication skills. Some folk don't really understand that they are the ones stopping themselves from being happy and are too quickly blaming the people around them, which can lead to feeling like they're a passive bystander in their own life. The way you communicated that to OP was excellent. I hope OP reads your comment and does a little self reflecting. He could be so much happier if he followed your advice.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "I think one of the problems here is that OP is to passive   to know what his boundaries, needs and wants are. \n\nHe only realised he didn't get enough time with his friend after the trip, when the friend told him so. He during the trip, which he didn't seem to help plan at all, he seemed to be fine with the plans. \n\nOP, why is your wife in charge of planning vacation? Is she in charge of a lot of the planning for your family?", "He shouldn't have to though. A loving and caring partner would understand and, if the main bread earner, finance the partners time to spend with their close friend. They could've still had a good holiday and allowed him more time to spend with said friend\n\nSo NTA. I guarantee if the roles were reversed, you'd also be saying NTA\n\nThere's literally no reason for it to be anything other than NTA\n\nEdit: Actually hilarious that not a single one of you cares to even refute what I've said. Shows how absolutely shallow you opinions on the matter are. If any of you actually have d shred of ability in articulating y9ur points, you'd actually reply to me, instead of only downvoting. Because, how dare I actually make you realise that you were wrong\n\nNot surprised the cross-sub traffic is what it is, for this sub", "I would go with YTA, maybe if he had helped to plan the trip, then he could have made room for the visit. As far as I can tell he both expected his wife to pay for and plan the trip and accommodate his needs instead of the families.

His comment history is just complaints and bashing his wife for things he could have and should have been doing that he off loaded onto her. A ton of people suggested taking a separate trip to visit his friend. OP\u2019s only response is that it would be too hard to fly two hours one weekend to dedicate time to his DYING friend and that he\u2019d rather do it during a family vacation he left his wife to plan and pay for.", "Literally gender doesn\u2019t matter here and neither does who paid. OP sold it to his wife as a family vacation where he wanted to see a dying friend. It\u2019s what he got. \n\nIt was a week long vacation with two days of traveling. From what it seems he got 20% of the vacation which is fair considering he\u2019s only 20% of the family. The fact that he wasn\u2019t clearer isn\u2019t his wife\u2019s fault. However the fact that he tried to mislead, didn\u2019t plan, and knew nothing about the activities but wants to blame his wife for that shows insane incompetence/ immaturity . He\u2019s TA for that alone, but the blame he shifts onto his wife for not being his mom in his post history takes the cake.", "He could do some of the planning himself instead of leaving it up to her to magically read his mind and make his dreams come true. \nAre you dense to the actual mental load of preparing the logistics for a family vacation with three preteens? Balancing everyones needs with the vague expectations of your spouse that's only thinking about what he wants.", "So she has to plan and pay for the vacation entirely on her own , but now she also has to watch the kids entirely on her own on a FAMILY vacation so dad can visit a friend that he clearly doesn\u2019t care enough about to book a short plane ride to go see on his own time? Wack as hell, he seems like such a useless husband.", "It  was a FAMILY vacation. I wouldn\u2019t want to have to plan and pay for an entire vacation along with taking on the load of watching 3 pre teens so that my husband can relax and hang out with a friend that he clearly doesn\u2019t care enough about to book his own separate trip to visit. A family vacation implies that it\u2019s time to be spent with family, not with dads Sick friend. I also think it\u2019s strange that no one has pointed out that that might not be a suitable situation for the sick friend either. If im terminally ill then the last thing I probably want is 5 people, 3 of those being kids,imposing themselves on my house for multiple days on end. That sounds exhausting for the friend as well! \nIf he actually cared that much about his friend he would book a separate weekend trip to visit him without the wife and kids, so that they could visit for ample time and so his friend wouldn\u2019t have to take on the stress of hosting/entertaining 5 people in his home while also being sick. OP is inconsiderate to his wife and children and to his sick friend.", "I am so confused. How is it not easy? I get that it might be difficult to afford or get time off but I really think you should be fighting to get a weekend off.", "And you spent some time with him. Where\u2019s the problem?", "I live in NJ and it\u2019s not that serious to go to CO for a four day weekend - you just want an excuse to not put in the work and blame your wife.", "as someone who spent a lot of time being bored at strangers houses as a kid i think they could have sucked it up. the house had a pool, likely a tv and internet spending two or three afternoons at someone\u2019s house because they are i\u2019ll seems perfectly reasonable to me", "12 hours on a 7 day trip is quite a lot. How much more time did you want to spend there? You do have children who think they're on a family vacation. You really think it's fun for them to spend time at a house of someone they don't know? Like don't plan these types of things into a family vacation if you want to allocate more than 12 hours on it. Go by yourself.", "So you got to spend about a day's worth of activity time with your friend in a 7 day trip. If I assume an hr a meal, 3 meals a day, and 8hrs sleep a day, that averages to about 13hrs a day for activities, travel time, and hygiene. If you wanted more than a day, you should have planned for a solo trip and not used a family vacation. YTA.", "12 hours is essentially a full day if you wanted more then you should\u2019ve planned your own trip to see him", "So you literally didn't even think it was too little time, expect in the aftermath where the entire thing suddenly becomes your wife's fault? She didn't foresee the future well enough for you?", "Bloody hell, man up. You\u2019re quite happy to go on vacations that you\u2019ve contributed nothing to, and now you have the audacity to make out you\u2019re the downtrodden man being pushed around by the controlling wife.", "When a dying friend says he wishes you\u2019d had more time together, he means that he doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left - I\u2019m sure he wishes he had more time to spend with a lot of people. He\u2019s not criticizing you because he thinks you didn\u2019t spend enough time with him on your family vacation.

To the point that we didn't take our 13yo to see her the last two weeks of my MIL's life. It just wasn't a memory we wanted for our daughter. \n\nTaking preteens to hang out with a stranger with stage 4 liver cancer would be awful. The husband absolutely should have gone to visit by himself. That's not a family vacation type of thing.", "Exactly, this entire thing just had me wonder why she had to be the full planner. If he wanted to spend a day with his friend, he could have taken it upon himself to offer low maintenance activities for her to do with the kids while he was there, like a museum, lunch, or even have the kids relax for an afternoon at the hotel. \n\nThey are meant to be partners, but she\u2019s taking on the logistics, planning and financing of vacations, how is that a fair distribution of the work? \n\nId also be curious to know: how long was the vacation? How much time did OP want to spend with his friend? How old exactly are the triplets? Would there be no other opportunity for OP to go see his friend for a weekend to spend more time with him?", "This. If you want to say goodbye to your friend plan another trip, pay for it yourself. There is nothing holding you back. You should have thought about it more yourself too. YTA", "I 100% agree. He should have planned a separate trip to say goodbye to his friend.

It\u2019d be sad and awkward.\n\nThe solution could have been that you stayed in Colorado for a couple extra days with your friend. You wouldn\u2019t have to worry about entertaining your kids or making your wife plan the trip around this visit. Or you could\u2019ve arrived a couple days early then met up with your family.\n\nGentle YTA because you can\u2019t expect your family to hang out somewhere for 2 days of vacation. It would be distracting to you and force your friend to play host to multiple extra people.", "OP is definitely the AH. When my close mate was dying with brain cancer I planned and paid for my trip to go see him by myself. My partner had no problems about me going either.

Both of those are vague requests that can be interpreted lots of ways and it still comes back to him simply requesting things from his wife and expecting them to just poof into existence. He definitely should have planned way more instead of dropping that burden on her then being mad at her for who even knows why.", "Right? He wasn\u2019t even upset until his friend told him to be after the fact and now he is retroactively going back and picking on his wife yet taking no responsibility for how HE could have done things differently.", "Like ask the wife if she wants to bring a friend or ask a family member to come along for childcare help so that he can sneak away for a bit, get creative.

She planned stuff for her kids and for her husband (even if it\u2019s not as much time as he wanted).

I understand OP wanting to visit his friend, but saying the kids wouldn't be bored bc the friend has a pool is just gross to me. This is a person and family that is suffering something awful. The family shouldn't be responsible for keeping his children entertained during that time. Easter for us was particularly horrible as we had people show up and expect us to feed them. As in, they went to the hospital to see my MIL, then invited themselves to my inlaws' house for Easter dinner. The audacity was appalling. It was not party time.", "Based on the post and the comments it sounds to me like OP is making requests of the wife but doing so almost like a child. Like he is asking the wife to do things or plan a certain way, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he is leveling with her as a partner. He keeps blaming it on her with comments like \u201cwell I told her I wanted time and I was surprised that I didn\u2019t get as much as I wanted\u201d. It doesn\u2019t seem like he is actively planning along with her. She seems to be planning around the kids since he says that that\u2019s what she is doing. He seems to be making requests but not doing the mental load of figuring out what that looks like with the kids. \n\nHe did say that he told her that the friends have a pool and that is a minor attempt to plan for the kids but she doesn\u2019t seem to have thought that the guys house was a good place for the kids to be spending a lot of time. I feel that if OP wants to accommodate time with his friend, he would need to ask about what her concerns are, then do the work of figuring out some alternative options (like inviting another family member to help her out, or looking into childcare options as some hotels have day camps for kids) and then presenting those alternatives to her and working with her so that he gets the time he wants and his kids are being entertained and his wife isn\u2019t having to manage them all by herself. \n\nInstead he seems stuck in a cycle of asking her to make things happen and then doing nothing else himself to get those things to happen.", "No. Why should the kid\u2019s family vacay get ruined because dad can\u2019t visit his friend alone and wants an all-in-one paid for by his wife? \n\nHe\u2019s not even paying.

I see both sides to this and can understand how it can be a tough situation with not much of a solution that everyone would be happy with. OP likely expected his wife to be a little bit more understanding in wanting to spend time with his friend and even though they were able to see him for a little while it wasn\u2019t exactly what OP had in mind. I do see the lack of empathy on her part in how OP described her response as: \u201cWe are not going to fly all the way there to stay at his house\u201d  and so I kind of feel like his wife should have suggested him to do the trip separately. This comes with complications too though in that it\u2019s another cost to go there, which maybe she or even both didn\u2019t want to have to pay for. If that was brought up I can even see OP feeling like that\u2019s an extra cost unnecessarily and would still try to get her to take the same trip with seeing his friend more. The kids are also not babies. They could entertain themselves especially in this day and age with tv , computer, and OP even mentioned there is a pool at his house. Sometimes teenagers have to deal with unpleasant situations like a person in the family or a friend dying. I remember visiting my grandparents in Florida or going there for their funerals and it not being the most fun thing, but we went to the pool at the clubhouse, played tennis, and found other things to do with our time. We didn\u2019t have school so whatever we did was fun regardless where we were.

At that age they should be responsible enough not to run off on her.", "Soft YTA because the vacation was where you wanted but she made plans for stuff to do and you got x amount of time to spend with your friend. You could have opted out of some stuff and had more time but you didn't and im sure it's because you wouldn't of went if she hadn't planned it there, at the place you asked for vacation. You also could have said im skipping this thing you had planned and seeing my friend and accepted her being mad as long as it wasn't every day all day. Was you wife and 3 kids just supposed to sit at the hotel or be by your friends side during their vacation? Your TA for being mad/upset after your friend called and not just disappointed that you didn't more time you could spend during the down times. She right about not spending the vacation at his bedside even if he had a pool. Also why would you want the family vacation to be mostly you gone and not with family? I ask because my husband was stationed in Germany and still talks regularly to about 5 or 6 guys he was with and having a family vacation to see one with stage 4 cancer of any kind wouldn't even come up. He'd say something about going alone and would try to go as many (which wouldn't be many due to income vs expenses) before it was that far along unless the friend didn't say til that point. Even then he wouldn't want the family vacation to be that. Your wife makes more yes but if you could afford just you to go im sure it wouldn't be an issue.

But I think YWBTA if all you had to say was you were disappointed with the trip she planned and paid for. If you are having these feelings, a conversation is a good idea rather than holding resentment. But you need to first come from a place of appreciation of all that she did. And recognize that she did listen to your needs by planning the family trip around seeing your friend in the first place. And then take your share of responsibility for not spending more time with your friend by not putting more effort into planning with your wife. And within that context, not painting her as the AH who didn't plan more time, I think it's a good idea to express regret about not having spent more time with your friend. I def encourage not bottling these feelings up, but also reflecting on your part of the situation rather than just blaming her.\n\nSorry about your friend. I hope you get another chance to see him. And either way, cherish the time you spent together.", "Also, OP, 10 year olds aren\u2019t pre-teens.", "I'm going to say YTA. That isn't an appropriate family trip to spend a day or two at your friend's house, regardless of the situation. You can plan your own separate trip and pay for your own flight if that's what you want to do. Also, you should be paying for a portion of the trip regardless if she makes more money. That's just the right thing to do since it sounds like finances are separate.", "So your wife paid and planned **everything** for your *entire*  family to go on a trip and you\u2019re mad she didn\u2019t give you a third of it to spend at your dying friends house?

When visiting friends and family on group trips it's not surprising that it would only be a few hours one day- it's a family vacation, not a trip to go see your friend. If that wasn't enough for you, you should've realized before the trip how much time you would've liked and either scheduled it with your wife to make sure everyone was happy, or just go on a separate trip. Expecting to have her plan everything and somehow know how long you would've liked was a bit too presumptuous on your part. And to expect your 3 children to be fine with lounging at a stranger's house for days on their vacation strikes me as thoughtless. Obviously though you aren't referring to him in the past tense so go see him. Then you have a trip where you can actually prioritize spending time with him.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry your friend is dying but you needed to plan your own separate goodbye visit (and pay for it if your wife feels she\u2019s already paying for most travel).

Grow up dude.", "I think everything could be solved with more communication BEFOREHAND, now while you need to express yourself, I advise you it would be better for you to plan a trip exclusively to spend time with your friend.\nYour triplets are preteens. Is not that they can't understand and won't make a chaos if you're not there.\n\nAlso, a family vacation should not turn into a goodbye and nostalgic trip. Is not that you don't deserve it, it's because these kind of things should be intimate between you and your friend and heartwarming than having involved your family and make it everything based on a schedule as you expected.\n\nSpeaking of schedule, it sounds that your wife did all the preparations and accomodations, so you could be more involved in that preparation as well even if she's the one paying for it, because that's what couples do. Not because it's her money it means both of you can't be in the process, you're a team.\n\nI don't waht to say you're an a-hole because that's a strong word, but you didn't do things correctly and for that reason now you feel bad.

It would be great for both of you and I really hope it can be possible.\n\nPD2: I think you should talk to your wife, not for blaming her for what happened, but for expressing yourself and be honest with her. I wouldn't be healthy for you to keep that grudge, but be wise with your words so in the future the plans would be better for everyone in the family and don't assume that since your friend has a pool your family would have fun, because that's not a visit with that purpose. Your family possibly would feel uncomfortable if you make them stay at your friend's house in a serious situation like this. This is a trip that you need to do alone.", "YTA.

It is absolutely not your wife's fault that things turned out this way.", "YTA\n\nIf you wanted to spend time with your friend you should have either arranged time separate from family activities or you should have flown out early.

You should make arrangements to fly by yourself to spen quality time with your friend.", "Yes, YTA. I totally understand your frustration... But your wife paid for most of the trip (if not all of it) and planned the entire thing and you're going to complain to her? Why did you not offer to plan it if you had specific things you wanted to do?\n\nIt is probably pretty hard to plan a vacation for five people that keeps everyone happy. Especially with pre-teens. I'm assuming that most of the activities were likely for the kids. Were there any activities that no one else liked and were clearly just for her? It sounds like you are turning it into the selfish act that she didn't plan several days of hanging out at your friends house when it really does not sound selfish to me. \n\nThe trip is over. Nothing good will come of telling her your frustrations. All that will do is make her feel bad, which there is really no benefit from. Next time, take a more active role in planning. \n\nI know you just went on vacation and probably took time off of work, but would it be possible for you to take an extended weekend to go visit your friend solo?
