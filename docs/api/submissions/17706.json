It would have been better for you to take a long weekend to visit your friend by yourself at another time.", "OP, there are lots of great comments here regarding your lack of initiative or agency in planning this trip, the fact that your wife seems to carry 100% of the mental load, and your inability to communicate with your wife like an adult. You didn't even really notice that you didn't spend as much time with him as you wanted, until he texted you saying so? Do you have any opinions or thoughts of your own? Also, the fact that your friend was in your wedding does not mean that he has any relationship with your wife or children.\n\nHowever, I just wanted to say, the trip you envisioned having, where your kids get to hang out in the backyard of a random person they don't know, while the adults have sad mourning time with a dying individual? That was every \"family vacation\" of my childhood, and it SUCKED. The only time we went anywhere was to visit my father's side of the family across the country, and the kids were expected to play in the backyard all day while all the adults talked and caught up. And one of the older adults was always either very ill or dying and it very awkward and uncomfortable. And yes, it was also boring as hell. Sometimes we'd get to do a fun thing on one or two of the \"vacation\" days but moslty it was just a week of hanging out with dying relatives we had little to no relationship with.\n\nLike pretty much every other commenter has said, if you want to go see your friend, take a trip to do that on your own.

She told you up front she did not want to fly out there to spend a lot of time with your friend as a family.

I can guess: you don't think they'll be met anyway and being upset and resentful is a frequent state of being for you. Perhaps being upset, put out, and feeling like a martyr feels familiar and even a bit comfortable to you at this point\n- you and your wife have a very different understanding of the phrase \"as much time as possible\"\n\nI am guessing you think your wife runs the family and you feel your wants and desires are not being considered by her enough.\n\nHave you considered you aren't actually being clear enough or straight forward enough about your true expectations? And when people inevitably fail to meet those expectations, you get sad and passive aggressive? Do you say you're fine when you aren't?\n\nIf I can impart anything to you, *you get what you want by being clear about it*. Just because something is Very Important to you doesn't mean it is Very Important to everyone around you. It may feel obvious to you that \"as much time as possible\" with your friend meant a few days' visit but your wife also has to take her needs and the kids' needs into consideration on the *family vacation*.\n\nPeople are not mind readers.
