You didn't even really notice that you didn't spend as much time with him as you wanted, until he texted you saying so? Do you have any opinions or thoughts of your own? Also, the fact that your friend was in your wedding does not mean that he has any relationship with your wife or children.\n\nHowever, I just wanted to say, the trip you envisioned having, where your kids get to hang out in the backyard of a random person they don't know, while the adults have sad mourning time with a dying individual? That was every \"family vacation\" of my childhood, and it SUCKED. The only time we went anywhere was to visit my father's side of the family across the country, and the kids were expected to play in the backyard all day while all the adults talked and caught up. And one of the older adults was always either very ill or dying and it very awkward and uncomfortable. And yes, it was also boring as hell. Sometimes we'd get to do a fun thing on one or two of the \"vacation\" days but moslty it was just a week of hanging out with dying relatives we had little to no relationship with.\n\nLike pretty much every other commenter has said, if you want to go see your friend, take a trip to do that on your own.

She told you up front she did not want to fly out there to spend a lot of time with your friend as a family.

I can guess: you don't think they'll be met anyway and being upset and resentful is a frequent state of being for you. Perhaps being upset, put out, and feeling like a martyr feels familiar and even a bit comfortable to you at this point\n- you and your wife have a very different understanding of the phrase \"as much time as possible\"\n\nI am guessing you think your wife runs the family and you feel your wants and desires are not being considered by her enough.\n\nHave you considered you aren't actually being clear enough or straight forward enough about your true expectations? And when people inevitably fail to meet those expectations, you get sad and passive aggressive? Do you say you're fine when you aren't?\n\nIf I can impart anything to you, *you get what you want by being clear about it*. Just because something is Very Important to you doesn't mean it is Very Important to everyone around you. It may feel obvious to you that \"as much time as possible\" with your friend meant a few days' visit but your wife also has to take her needs and the kids' needs into consideration on the *family vacation*.\n\nPeople are not mind readers.

You should have spoken up. What stood in your way wasnt your wifes itinerary it was your a) inability to be really, properly, involved in making it or b) your inability to challenge it. Like gaaaah! Walk out the door, see your friend, let the wife sit in the Airbnb mad as all hell with the triplets if you have to..... if seeing your friend is so important..... just don't act like you have no agency to see your dying friend because your wife messed up your timetable. There are a lot of excuses on your end here. Sometimes you need to make a fuss, dude!\n\nYou can't insist both that your feelings were so strong and obvious that your wife was callous to disregard them, AND also tell us that you weren't willing to have a small argument / conflict with her to change the plan last minute?

Maybe if you sat down and participated in planning, rather than just telling her vaguely that you want to spend time with this guy, there would be a more satisfactory outcome for you? Like \"hey i want to do this\" and leaving her to figure out the details seems disrespectful in the first place, and then criticising her when it didnt work out exactly how you wanted it. I'm just not understanding why you are treating your wife like your personal assistant to \"schedule\" time for you?", "Ask him to send you money to go see him if he\u2019s that upset.

It was no win situation for anyone. \n\nGo talk to your wife. Explain how much you want to see him. This is important enough to warrant a) a second trip to colorado and b) some money from the family budget to do so.  \n\nTo be clear - you seeing your friend should be a top priority and supported by your wife. \n\nBut it should not have been built into the family holiday trip.\n\nEDIT: just saw you say that the distance is too far for a weekend trip - that changes things a bit. I was imagining a short internal flight - is it a much bigger trip?

You couldn't even ask for that before you went? \n\nYour wife was so callous, that before you went on a 7-day family holiday, she couldn't agree to you spending even one day with your dying friend? Jesus, seems so harsh.\n\nHow did you word it her thought? Did you ask to spend several days? or did you say you would just like perhaps a whole day to hang and do whatever with him?", "You keep saying that your wife knows your friend because he was at your wedding. One interaction, on her WEDDING DAY does not make your friend into her friend. I can't believe you expected your wife and 3 children to spend time with your dying friend- a person that they don't have a relationship with.

And hanging out at the home of dad's extremely ill friend isn't fun for the kids. It's awkward, with a lot of uncertainty. This wasn't a fair request during a family trip. I don't care who paid. You're married, you two handle money however you want. As someone who's been married a long time myself, even if you had paid for the whole thing it was a *family* vacation.\n\nFly back out there. Instead of attacking your wife's planning (not sure why she's carrying all the emotional labor of vacations, it's exhausting), approach her and explain that you'd like a chance to see your friend once more when it's more private and less rushed.

I've seen this reply on plenty of other posts. You got to see him last year and whilst his condition has deteriorated you don't get to hijack a family vacation that you didn't pay for to get more time. YOU were the one who suggested Colorado with the specific desire to spend time with your mate. Your wife told you you wouldn't get much time because of how she was planning the trip she paid for. And I don't blame her for not wanting to singlehandedly schlep the kids out to family activities whilst you spent a few days with your friend. YTA", "Bruh, it's not even about the money. You didn't plan anything. Did you offer to book the hotel? Come up with any ideas for activities and then do whatever needed doing to make that happen (i.e. snow board rental or something)?

It would be brutal, but I think you feel like your friends would be worth some fatigue. \n\nNext time, you need to use your big boy words and, while still in the earliest stages of planning, \"I would like 2 days to spend with good friend,\" instead of just making a vague request and then bring upset it wasn't longer. \n\nAnd go thank your wife for taking on the vacation planning. That's a big job.", "In your wife\u2019s defense, she was also in a tough spot as you would have wished her to supervise your preteen triplets for more than a day without another adult\u2019s help on what was likely a very active, outdoorsy vacation.

This was a 1-week family vacation. \nYou\u2019re grieving the end of your friend\u2019s life, and it\u2019s natural for you both to wish you had had more time together.

This flight should only be 2-3 hours and probably just one way.  Is it still Inconvenient? I'm sure it is.  But if it's really worth it to OP to see his friend, he will make it happen.
