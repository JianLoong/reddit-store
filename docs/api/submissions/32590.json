She\u2019s not wrong for wanting her own space as a 14 yo and if her dad can provide that for her than you should see that as a good thing. \n\nAre her siblings half/step siblings? What was your part in this that she resents them so much?", "Info: when you say you contacted her again to see if she changed her mind, do you mean this is the first time in 4 years you've had this conversation or the first time in 4 years you've had contact?", "I suspect missing reasons here that make this a YTA call.\n\nYou're bitching about the fact that your daughter is choosing money over her family, yet most of her conditions were clearly a cry for attention from her mother. From your comments, these kids who have made it impossible for her to have ANY one on one time with her mother are children you had with your second husband. Why can't he care for the kids while you have some time with your daughter? Why did you have more children than you could afford if it was going to compromise your relationship with your daughter?\n\nYou speak about her in a rather dismissive, unpleasant way but I still get the feeling that what has happened here is largely your doing. And if I get that even from your one-sided account, I can only imagine the actual truth of the matter...", "... 3 kids in a 2 bedroom house ? No wonder she wanted to get away. With her, that was four. Four kids in the same room. Of course she doesn't want to come back to that chaos.  \n\nYTA. To me, those conditions seems like a cry for help : she lacked your attention to the point she went away with no contact, and now that YOU want her back, she makes her boundaries clear. \n\nBottom line is, what she said is she wants to feel at home and she wants to spend quality time with you, and you called her a brat.", "You don\u2019t even sound like you like your daughter. I wonder if that has any reason why she made the decision to live with her dad at 10 years old. And you seem like you have your hands full with two other children that you can\u2019t afford.

Clearly you were just happy she was out of your life so you could concentrate on your favourites.\n\nWere you happy to say bye because she reminded you of your ex?\n\nCan\u2019t blame her for wanting some sort of proof you love her after abandoning her.

You are calling her a \"spoiled brat\" now but what are the chances that you will demand money from her and treat her siblings with gifts once she turns 18 and get a job? \n\nHer conditions are not unreasonable as a teenager.

Her Dad is now well off and famous so holding her accountable , hoping for an apology , or compromise are gone. She\u2019s technically an adult but last year emotionally probably was operating on pre-Covid maturity levels. *fyi she disrespected my mom in her own house and when I wouldn\u2019 take her side and expressed I felt she acted wrongly  , she tried to tell me my mom was mean and abusive. I live in the same house..it was utter b.s . Next thing I know she called her step mom and she scooped her up and they were off. \n\nI am sure the Divorce was hard on her and neither you or her Dad were perfect but she\u2019s missing out on having two families who love her .  She obviously also resent the other kids and having to share you . I get that . It\u2019s like when I had a girl BFF and another girl tags a long and they vibe better , but it\u2019s her mom , and she really only spends so much time with you . I still don\u2019t like her dictating anything frankly but glad you could do one of them for her , sorry she declined. \n\nHow about you offer to spend time with her in family counseling ? Would she go for that, just  a thought ? A healthy constructive  way to talk things out ? \n\n\n\nFYI my kid/adult is in counseling and I am shut out .", "YTA. I suspect She was feeling neglected. She wants to be important to you.  Even your attitude in your post screams I have made my daughter unwelcome. Which is why she left 4 years ago.", "YTA you sound like you do not like your daughter.  \n\nIt sounds like a child trying to ask for some more time with her mother and it sounds like you just want to dismiss. \n\nHave you offered a compromise maybe go out for the day just the two of you to start at building something.  \n\nYour current partner can stay at home with your other kids.   It would be good bonding with them.   \n\n\nThere is as many people point out a lot missing which you are not clear with what was the timeline from splitting with her father to when you started living wit your partner?   What was the arrangement on her custody etc. when you split.  What contact have you had in the last 4 years?", "YTA. From her requests, it sounds like she wants some one-on-one time with her mom. Also, why do you assume she will choose to dress in some deeply insulting way and what have you said to her in her past that she feels the need to preemptively curb your judgement? \n\nYou can be insecure about having less money than her father, but using that as a scapegoat for why you don\u2019t have a relationship with her rather than facing the fact that you may have some part in the blame is not okay. Children shouldn\u2019t have to chase their parents for a relationship, don\u2019t be surprised when you two are permanently estranged.", "YTA From her \u201cdemands\u201d it sounds like you don\u2019t spend enough one on one time with her. Do you not schedule days where you two do something together? Also, four kids in a two bedroom is too much - you should have thought about that before having more kids than you have room.", "I think there\u2019s a lot of missing reasons here. \n\nYou\u2019ve got three children in a 2bed and wonder why she doesn\u2019t want to visit let alone live. You can\u2019t give her any one on one time because toddlers. \n\nSounds like she feels and is rather pushed out via a second family. \n\nShe\u2019s shouting mummy love me and want me and give me attention and your saying yeah no sorry the littles need me bye then.", "Info: She's 14 now and her next sibling is at least six.

What kind of attention did you give her afterwards?", "INFO\n\nwhat happened 4 years ago when she was 10? \n\nNegotiating with a 14 YO is asinine, negotiating with a 10 YO isn't possible. \n\nWhat did your ex say 4 years ago to ensure alignment here?", "YTA - I think there\u2019s a whole lot more context that we\u2019re missing and the daughter\u2019s \u201cdemands\u201d arent the real issue. \n\nWhat makes you the AH is that your daughter does not want to see you and instead of addressing what is likely the actual issues, youre engaged in a petty squabble with a teenager about it.", "YTA there\u2019s way too many holes and missing missing reasons . You give yourself away by the way you speak about your daughter. Your attitude is shady as hell", "I\u2019m sure you can find a way to have a regular scheduled 1:1 outing or time together after the young ones bedtime etc.\nIt sounds like she is asking for the impossible and potentially being prompted, or at least encouraged to believe she deserves these unattainable requests. There\u2019s not quite enough to determine, but they are very specific demands and she\u2019s getting the ideas somewhere. \n\nSadly some parents do stuff like this, you\u2019ll have parent A telling the kid that parent B is an inadequate parent because they can\u2019t afford to take the child on fancy holidays and regular international trips, meanwhile parent A is withholding child support and fi don\u2019t other ways to financially screw parent B. It suck for the kids in the middle. \n\nI hope you recover a relationship when she is old enough to know better.

Why can\u2019t they take care of their kids for a few hours so you could give her some one-on-one time?\n\nHonestly, if this is how you act to a child you\u2019re supposed to love, then she\u2019s actually better off without you!", "ESH. Her demands are ridiculous and impossible and I suspect she knew that. She just wanted to create a situation where ,in her mind, you didn't put her first. However your reaction was childish and you stooped to a 14 year old's level. \n\nYou could have simply said that you would love if she could visit but she knows that those conditions are impossible. You should have let her know that you'll be there if she ever changes her mind.", "I need more info. What caused her to move in with her Dad and go no contact? I don\u2019t know a lot of children that cut their parents off for zero reason.  This story seems to be missing a few pieces imo.", "Do you even like your daughter. Or you one of those parents that got the re do family that come first because the other parent can take care of the first born \n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like you even want her in your home", "ESH\n-a 10 years old deciding where to leave and totally alienating one parent? And you\u2026 ok.\nI don\u2019t know what was the situation but unless you had major abusive tendency no way. You AH cause you just let your relationship with your daughter go.\n-your daughter sounds a spoiled brat\n-your ex-husband to be ok to have you out of your daughter\u2019s life whatever and raising this supreme brat\n-you gain cause really 3 kids 2 bedroom\u2026 yes a 14 years old can\u2019t share a room with a toddler n a first grader. Which I hope at least 1 is step child cause otherwise the math doesn\u2019t add up.", "I am sorry for this. Also that she called you a bitch. you do not deserve that. I assume you\u2019re from the US? In my country, Germany, the poorest group are single women. And 90% of single parents are women. This is a very big structural problem here and you not being alone not able to afford a room on her own. \n\nWhat was the reason she moved in with her dad? In Germany, he would be legally obliged to pay you money if she moves in with you. Can you talk to him about this? Or maybe even sue him with the help of a feminist lawyer/ngo? \n\nStill I would say: She is just a kid and that\u2019s how she reacts. And becoming a pawn in the capitalist and gender based financial injustices. This is more about her father and you than about her. \n\nNTA.", "So her first condition is very understandable (there's no teenager that wants to share a room with younger siblings), but if you don't have the room there's nothing to be done. N-A-H on that.\n\nConditions 2 and 3 are completely unreasonable and reek of entitlement and attention-seeking. Not a good look for her, but I wonder why - is this a result of genuine neglect? Being ignored? Or just a spoiled child? I can't judge.\n\nCondition 4 is a non-issue since you agreed, but there are always boundaries that some kids will cross to try to provoke a parent (and at least sometimes it will work, there are reasonable limits to freedom of expression for a child). \n\nSo based on that, not really enough information, but your immediate reaction to her saying she doesn't want to come is to call her a brat and accusing her of valuing money over family. That makes YTA.\n\nHer reaction to your insult wasn't appropriate, but given she's 14 and you were the one that started with the insults I'm not going to put her down to your level.", "NTA. Like every parent you have rules of your home. But how did you let a 10 year old to make that decision? Was this decision in front of a judge. As for her calling you that name I would send her a bar of soap for Christmas and write on it \"to be used to wash our the mouth\".", "Info needed. Are you married now?", "This is a case of missing reasons. A 10 year old doesn't choose to avoid going to visit her mom for no reason. Her conditions point to her feeling like you've never had some quality one on one time with her and that you would ignore her when she's over.\n\nIt also doesn't feel like you like her very much. Why do you even want her to visit you if you don't have time to spend with her? Are you looking for a babysitter? \n\nYTA for the missing reasons and for the clear disdain you have for your kid", "NTA, She's acting entitled due to her father constantly spoiling and giving her what she wants, and expecting everything to go her way.", "NTA\n\nshe is entitled and spoilt. \n\nThis is so sad for you but what can you do. Daddy obviously spoils her and she has no concept of life in the real world where the rest of us live.\n\nShe will eventually regret this.", "NTA.\n\nWell, she sounds terrible.

This was all an exercise in attempting to hurt you, she never had any intention of spending time with you.", "YTA. \n\nShe chose to live with her dad because she was pushed to the side when her half siblings were born, and (unless you\u2019ve moved to a smaller house since, which would be stupid with two kids) was expected to share a room with them. \n\nYou had more kids than you could afford and you gave all your attention to the youngest. Your daughter moved to be with her dad so that she could feel like a priority. Her conditions for coming back are that you make some changes so that she feels valued in your life- yet you expect a 14 year old to sleep on the sofa every time she\u2019s at your house? \n\nShe\u2019s made a sensible decision.", "NTA.

We didn't get divorced 4 years ago thats just when my daughter left", "Yes", "Of course I want to spend time with her but expecting me to not pay any attention to my other kids during those weekends is insane", "Sounds like mother dearest has a problem with ex husband providing for his daughter. This woman has no space in her household for her daughter. She has a problem with giving her daughter- who she doesn\u2019t see- any attention unless the other kids are there. Just the way this woman speaks about her daughter is shady as hell.", "Seriously? The mom had three do over babies and can't even afford a sitter to spend an hour alone with this kid.", "Insane. It's entitled to want your own room?", "I actually think she did. Unfortunately I think it was an attempt to hurt her siblings", "Didn\u2019t say that but would you also expect her to move home and share a bedroom with three half siblings when she can live comfortably with her dad who seems to be a good parent? And live with a mom who guilts her like so?", "Look it would be one thing if it were unavoidable to have to share a room but seriously you can\u2019t blame a teenager for preferring to live in the home where they have their own space over one where they have to share with littles. \n\nYou all suck here - daddy for flashing his money around and breeding entitlement, your daughter for her shitty attitude re: points 2 & 3, and you for being so dismissive of your kid instead of acknowledging that there are *legitimate* reasons for her preference and idk actually talking it through with her without your resentment seeping through.\n\nEDIT: Also, where are the little kids\u2019 dads? It is not actually unreasonable for her to want 1:1 time with her mother and if you aren\u2019t giving her ANY of that, well yeah no wonder she\u2019s acting like a brat, her needs aren\u2019t being met.", "You're being disingenuous here. \n\nShe was 10 years old. That's not a suitable age for a child to make a decision on their permanent living situation. That's a time when her parents were responsible to make the decision for her. She can provide input, but you (and her father) were responsible and need to be held accountable for that decision. \n\nIf you truly did allow her to unanimously make the decision to live with her father, and at that time you didn't require visitation because it was her want - that was a horrible decision on your part and you're being held to account now. I imagine she has some pretty serious abandonment issues, and I sympathize with that, I can't imagine why she wouldn't. \n\nNow, she's 14 and you are making accusations about her, and clearly harbour resentment towards your child for the decision you think she made when she was 10. You're being petty against the judgement of a 10 year old. But it was your bad decision, your inaction. Take some responsibility for this situation. \n\nYTA", "Is that what you tell yourself ? This seems more like your 14 year old was probably having to share a room with toddlers , and you probably don\u2019t bother spending any time with her . Your whole attitude speaking about her sparks the idea that there\u2019s more to it than what you\u2019re saying . \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of missing missing reasons here , but your whole attitude around your daughter screams that YTA", "Well then yep NTA for a child to disown their own mother because of entitlement?

If you have three kids , why don\u2019t you have proper space for them ? You also sound extremely jealous that her father can and does spoil her .

Even if you cannot do that the whole weekend, you can DEFINITELY do so for a few hours so she has alone time with you. You don't necessarily need to give her all of her demands but you need to accommodate some. If you don't, you will lose your daughter forever. You are already running out of time. But by the sound of your letter, you don't even seem to like her. You ran off and formed a new family without even getting a place with enough bedrooms for her.
