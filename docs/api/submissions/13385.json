Me (19f), Jayden (17m), Remi (10f) and Jonah (6m). Five years ago we lost our mom. Four years ago dad remarried. Jayden and I didn't mind though we knew dad's wife would never be our mom. Jonah was a baby and didn't remember mom so he started to see dad's wife as his only mom. Remi sees herself as having two moms. She's not as close to dad's wife as Jonah is but doesn't see her as a non parent like Jayden and me.\n\nDad asked me and my brother not to talk about mom around Jonah in case it interfered in the relationship he built with dad's wife. He said he would know about mom but didn't need to hear all about her all the time. With Remi, he said to let her ask but try not talk about mom around her if she didn't ask. We respected that although we disagreed with his decision. He said we had years with mom. They were young enough that seeing his wife as mom would be healthier for them. He also said that his wife deserved the chance to be known as mom since she'd be raising them for the rest of their childhood and it would be over a decade for both of them.\n\nI love all my siblings. But I know Remi used to be frustrated with Jayden and me because we wouldn't celebrate dad's wife for Mother's Day, or because we would go to mom's grave without her, or we'd talk about mom without her. But again, that was what dad told us to do. Jayden even told dad it annoyed her and he told us to keep sticking to our word. When she did ask we would include her. But we also didn't share the same love for dad's wife.\n\nWith Jonah, he struggles to understand how Remi has two moms, Jayden and I are siblings but we have a different mom. About a year ago he said we were his adopted siblings and that's how he made it make sense. We started to correct him but dad cut us off. So we left it alone. It did mean that Jonah kind of put us in boxes away from him. As became clear when, for a school project recently, he drew his family with just dad and dad's wife, Remi was to the side but away from the three and Jayden and I were completely separate. He told his teacher that we were adopted siblings but not really since we didn't have the same parents and how his real family was his mom and dad.\n\nThis is when dad commented to Jayden and me that it feels like we're half siblings instead of just siblings. That our relationship is not what he thought it would be. I told him that that is because of his choices. That his desire to override mom for Jonah, and for us to keep quiet around Remi unless she asked, means feelings and confusion have separated us. Dad told me it wasn't fair to blame him and if Jayden and I had just been more open to a second mother none of this would have happened.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680005002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124mlr4/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_feels_like_my_siblings/", "score": 3603, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He tried to say all related through him but failed to see where confusion would come in when Jonah didn't understand different moms, multiple ones and living together but \"claiming different moms\". I'm pretty sure he attempted to make it simple. But simple in a full grown man's head is not always going to be simple to a five year old child.", "I don't see that happening. Especially because he would have to face the reality that who mom is to all of us is not only different, but has led to some very complicated feelings in two young kids. As well as a feeling of being left out.", "Yeah, I agree with you there. I think his wish was for me and Jayden to fall in love with his wife and maybe that by being a good mom to the younger ones, we'd love her just as much for that reason alone. But I could never claim anyone as another mom. Jayden feels pretty much the same.

I'm in college but I do try to visit to at least see my siblings.", "She's on board with having the chance to be the only mom to my two youngest siblings.

The only thing I'll say is I really don't think he's as bad as some others here do. I feel like he just knew how much your mom's passing hurt you all, and simply wanted to protect the younger 2 kids from that as much as possible. He probably thought that because you and Jayden understood what has happened, that there was no shielding you, but maybe he could shield the other 2. It's clear to you (and to him now in hindsight) it was a big mistake, but it can't be undone sadly. You're definitely not an asshole for telling him the truth, and he's definitely TA for trying to pin blame on you. \n\nI'm sure you don't particularly want to argue with your dad over this topic, but it's worth considering that Remi and Jonah will piece things together at some point and be hurt. It's worth staying on his case to get him to be honest with them gradually, and straighten things out for them, even if it's hard for you, it will be good for your younger siblings. \n\nLike many others here suggested, I think group therapy would be very beneficial.", "Then it\u2019s on both of them completely, the major problem is that and Jayden are now complicit in the lies so if/when the two youngest really find out what\u2019s gone on you\u2019ll be part of the blame.\n\nThis is an absolutely despicable thing for them to do, not only is he lying to the two youngest but he\u2019s actively putting a wedge between you all as siblings. Then has the gall to wonder why it\u2019s all going wrong when he\u2019s banning the topic of your mother from ever being talked about.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be surprised when you and Jayden cut contact from him and stepmom for all this.", "They are both majorly fucked up and emotionally cruel to the two of you.", "Sorry - it just seemed as though he moved on really quickly.

For most people, the first year or two after a death are the worst and you were already being asked to welcome a \"new mom\" to the fold. I think that was completely unfair and that your father handled it poorly.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss. The loss of a parent is one that you feel at some level for the rest of your life. It's sad that you could not bond with your own siblings over the loss of your mother.", "I'm sorry to hear that your relationship with your siblings has been affected by your dad's decision to prioritize his new wife's role as a mother figure for your younger siblings. It's understandable that it has caused tension and confusion, especially for the younger ones who may not fully understand the situation. It's good to hear that you and your brother Jayden have a close relationship, but it's also important to try and bridge the gap with your other siblings if possible. Have you talked to your dad about how his decisions have affected your family dynamic? Maybe an open and honest conversation could help clarify things and bring you all closer together.", "We were still kids when this all started. Not very many choices there.

I think he actively wanted that for my younger two siblings. They were at ages where the chances for her to be just mom were greater. I think it kills him a bit that Remi acknowledges two mom's. I think he was hoping she and Jonah would share the love for only one mom, his wife. It's fucked up. But I get that Jayden and I had mom for longer. Still, it has sucked to know my youngest brother doesn't even know she is his mom, and that she's just some random woman who's our mom.

Yes, you could have acted differently, but you didn't want to and instead of listening to how you felt he ignored you in favour of trying to avoid a non-existent potential problem.\n\nI grew up in a similar situation in terms of parents and the ages of me and my siblings and the relationships to my fathers wife turned out about the same, the older siblings have a stepmom/woman who is married to our father, the middle ones have a mother who isn't their bio-mom and my youngest sibling is her and my fathers bio kid. All my siblings are just siblings regardless of age and who the biomom is, and there hasn't been any lasting trouble from it (I was a AH teenager to my stepmom a bit when I was a teenager, but that is expected and I grew up and we got over it).\n\nPeople aren't perfect and it wouldn't be fair to say he did it on purpose but it is 100% your fathers mistake and he is a total AH for trying to pin it on you and your siblings.\n\nIf you have anything like a reasonable relationship with your younger siblings please try to be nice to them, the fallout from this is probably going to be a lot more difficult for them than it will be for anyone else and if they feel like you hold any of this against them it will hurt them a lot.", "NTA\n\nOne day the truth IS going to come out, and the little ones (especially Jonah) are going to be very hurt that they\u2019ve been lied to and manipulated in this way.", "NTA, yeah your dad reaped what he sowed.

Your father remarried quickly because he couldn\u2019t handle being a single parent and wanted a live in nanny, housekeeper and cook. Telling his oldest children to not talk about their deceased mother around the youngest is cruel and abusive and shows his lack of emotional intelligence. It also shows that he did absolutely no grief therapy for any of you. He just moved along to another woman to play happy family while ignoring the trauma, grief and loss that you all have been through with the death of your mother. Your father is being incredibly abusive to not allow you to talk about your mother around the younger siblings and for letting your youngest sibling believe you are adopted then letting him know who his mother is. Jonah will feel betrayed and deceived when he finds out the lies of your father. Your father is ensuring estrangement is in the future between him and his children. Your father is 10000% to blame for everything. He rushed into marriage because he didn\u2019t want to be a single father, didn\u2019t get any of you therapy and support to deal with the death of your mother and this new woman he married, then he forced you to not talk about your mother and he erased her from the lives of your youngest siblings to the point that your youngest brother does not believe you are his real family. This is all because of your father. He has failed you all. NTA", "NTA \n\nI feel so bad for your family. That is so sad.  You are not at fault. He told you to delete a parent and expected it to go well?", "**NTA** \\- I hate it when the parent says to the child \"If you would just be different, it woul dbe convenient for me.\"", "Obviously your dads choices have caused some trauma. It\u2019s not normal for a 6 year old to care that much about whose parents are whose. It should be enough you are his siblings. The fact that he is pulling away makes me wonder what else he has been told.\n\nMy brother and sister have different dads than me. I\u2019m the youngest and I always knew. It never caused any problems for us. We don\u2019t even use it like the term \u2018half siblings\u2019. To us we are all siblings and that\u2019s it.\n\nNTA and your dad is unnecessary causing a lot of problems. You all lost your mom. Even the youngest. Even if he can\u2019t remember, that\u2019s a loss that he should be being encouraged to process. One day it will all come out and he will be very hurt.", "This comment just made me unpack some things that I haven't realized in years of therapy.", "It's unfortunate that he doesn't see the distance and anger that will come his way one day when all the truth finally comes out.  I'm sorry he's putting you in this horrible situation.  I do say you are an adult at 19 and should feel free to speak your mind and the truth, but you might not have that independence from him yet. NTA OP.", "I hate to say this op.  But your dad reaped what he sowed. He has nobody to blame but himself. He's the one that enforced this fucked up family dynamic by denying his children the truth. He is to blame. He needs to take accountability. Yet instead he's blaming you. Your dad is in denial.", "Hopefully he'll find out and understand that it wasn't willingly on OP's and Jayden's part.", "The new wife wasn't married to her, though. She was a stranger. \n\nErasing _your whole wife_ from existence,  that is fucked up in a way only misogyny achieved.", "> The only thing I'll say is I really don't think he's as bad as some others here do.\n\nThe thing that makes him actively a bad parent here instead of just a confused dad struggling to make his way in the world is that he's blaming OP for the direct consequences of his own actions, and even doubling down on that at the end of the post. Not saying he's no-contact worthy or anything extreme like that but this isn't actually excusable behavior and he owes OP a complete apology and Jonah a real explanation. It sounds like Jonah literally doesn't even realize he has a different biological mom and the longer you draw out that lie the worse it'll get when he finds out.", "Exactly! OP and the older brother should be encouraged to help the littles get to know their \u201creal\u201d mom. And if stepmom gets jealous of a dead person that\u2019s on her.", "You realise I said exactly that further down, right? \"He's TA for pinning blame on you\" and next paragraph Jonah and Remi will be hurt down the line if things aren't cleared up... \n\nMy initial point was only regarding his initial reason for the lie, that I don't think it was selfish or purely to make new wife feel more \"mom\". I'm sure it was a factor, but sounds more like he wanted to protect the baby. He didn't forbid them from talking about it or tell them to lie directly, just asked them not to initiate those conversations. It's still really bad.", "What the hell?! If they\u2019re (dad and step mom) are treating Jonah as the dad\u2019s wife\u2019s child then just come up with a lie saying he\u2019s the half sibling. If dad is making an effort to make it seem like his wife is Jonah\u2019s mom, then just lie saying Jonah is a half sibling.", "Tell him you no longer agree to follow what he said.", "Out of curiosity do you happen to have a link for that?"]}
