Me (19f), Jayden (17m), Remi (10f) and Jonah (6m). Five years ago we lost our mom. Four years ago dad remarried. Jayden and I didn't mind though we knew dad's wife would never be our mom. Jonah was a baby and didn't remember mom so he started to see dad's wife as his only mom. Remi sees herself as having two moms. She's not as close to dad's wife as Jonah is but doesn't see her as a non parent like Jayden and me.\n\nDad asked me and my brother not to talk about mom around Jonah in case it interfered in the relationship he built with dad's wife. He said he would know about mom but didn't need to hear all about her all the time. With Remi, he said to let her ask but try not talk about mom around her if she didn't ask. We respected that although we disagreed with his decision. He said we had years with mom. They were young enough that seeing his wife as mom would be healthier for them. He also said that his wife deserved the chance to be known as mom since she'd be raising them for the rest of their childhood and it would be over a decade for both of them.\n\nI love all my siblings. But I know Remi used to be frustrated with Jayden and me because we wouldn't celebrate dad's wife for Mother's Day, or because we would go to mom's grave without her, or we'd talk about mom without her. But again, that was what dad told us to do. Jayden even told dad it annoyed her and he told us to keep sticking to our word. When she did ask we would include her. But we also didn't share the same love for dad's wife.\n\nWith Jonah, he struggles to understand how Remi has two moms, Jayden and I are siblings but we have a different mom. About a year ago he said we were his adopted siblings and that's how he made it make sense. We started to correct him but dad cut us off. So we left it alone. It did mean that Jonah kind of put us in boxes away from him. As became clear when, for a school project recently, he drew his family with just dad and dad's wife, Remi was to the side but away from the three and Jayden and I were completely separate. He told his teacher that we were adopted siblings but not really since we didn't have the same parents and how his real family was his mom and dad.\n\nThis is when dad commented to Jayden and me that it feels like we're half siblings instead of just siblings. That our relationship is not what he thought it would be. I told him that that is because of his choices. That his desire to override mom for Jonah, and for us to keep quiet around Remi unless she asked, means feelings and confusion have separated us. Dad told me it wasn't fair to blame him and if Jayden and I had just been more open to a second mother none of this would have happened.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680005002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124mlr4/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_feels_like_my_siblings/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He tried to say all related through him but failed to see where confusion would come in when Jonah didn't understand different moms, multiple ones and living together but \"claiming different moms\". I'm pretty sure he attempted to make it simple. But simple in a full grown man's head is not always going to be simple to a five year old child.", "I don't see that happening. Especially because he would have to face the reality that who mom is to all of us is not only different, but has led to some very complicated feelings in two young kids. As well as a feeling of being left out.", "Yeah, I agree with you there. I think his wish was for me and Jayden to fall in love with his wife and maybe that by being a good mom to the younger ones, we'd love her just as much for that reason alone. But I could never claim anyone as another mom. Jayden feels pretty much the same. We had a very much established and loving relationship with mom and nobody could ever compare or get close to that again.", "I already moved out. I'm in college but I do try to visit to at least see my siblings.", "She's on board with having the chance to be the only mom to my two youngest siblings.

But it has caused some tension between us and our sister and then a distance and confusion with our youngest brother.", "He tried to make it simple but it's just not, in his scheme your mom both exists and doesn't exist at the same time, even a sci-fi fanatic wouldn't grasp it well. The only thing I'll say is I really don't think he's as bad as some others here do. I feel like he just knew how much your mom's passing hurt you all, and simply wanted to protect the younger 2 kids from that as much as possible. He probably thought that because you and Jayden understood what has happened, that there was no shielding you, but maybe he could shield the other 2. It's clear to you (and to him now in hindsight) it was a big mistake, but it can't be undone sadly. You're definitely not an asshole for telling him the truth, and he's definitely TA for trying to pin blame on you. \n\nI'm sure you don't particularly want to argue with your dad over this topic, but it's worth considering that Remi and Jonah will piece things together at some point and be hurt. It's worth staying on his case to get him to be honest with them gradually, and straighten things out for them, even if it's hard for you, it will be good for your younger siblings. \n\nLike many others here suggested, I think group therapy would be very beneficial.", "Then it\u2019s on both of them completely, the major problem is that and Jayden are now complicit in the lies so if/when the two youngest really find out what\u2019s gone on you\u2019ll be part of the blame.\n\nThis is an absolutely despicable thing for them to do, not only is he lying to the two youngest but he\u2019s actively putting a wedge between you all as siblings. Then has the gall to wonder why it\u2019s all going wrong when he\u2019s banning the topic of your mother from ever being talked about.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be surprised when you and Jayden cut contact from him and stepmom for all this.", "They are both majorly fucked up and emotionally cruel to the two of you.", "Sorry - it just seemed as though he moved on really quickly. New wife, don't talk about the old one, etc. You are NTA, but I think your father is a bit of one. For most people, the first year or two after a death are the worst and you were already being asked to welcome a \"new mom\" to the fold. I think that was completely unfair and that your father handled it poorly.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss. The loss of a parent is one that you feel at some level for the rest of your life. It's sad that you could not bond with your own siblings over the loss of your mother.", "I'm sorry to hear that your relationship with your siblings has been affected by your dad's decision to prioritize his new wife's role as a mother figure for your younger siblings. It's understandable that it has caused tension and confusion, especially for the younger ones who may not fully understand the situation. It's good to hear that you and your brother Jayden have a close relationship, but it's also important to try and bridge the gap with your other siblings if possible. Have you talked to your dad about how his decisions have affected your family dynamic? Maybe an open and honest conversation could help clarify things and bring you all closer together.", "We were still kids when this all started. Not very many choices there. I'd tell them the truth in a heartbeat but don't want to fuck up their childhoods even more because I think dad would be angry enough to cut me off, maybe even Jayden, and then they wouldn't have us for support after a truth drop like that.", "He did. I think he actively wanted that for my younger two siblings. They were at ages where the chances for her to be just mom were greater. I think it kills him a bit that Remi acknowledges two mom's. I think he was hoping she and Jonah would share the love for only one mom, his wife. It's fucked up. But I get that Jayden and I had mom for longer. Still, it has sucked to know my youngest brother doesn't even know she is his mom, and that she's just some random woman who's our mom.

Yes, you could have acted differently, but you didn't want to and instead of listening to how you felt he ignored you in favour of trying to avoid a non-existent potential problem.\n\nI grew up in a similar situation in terms of parents and the ages of me and my siblings and the relationships to my fathers wife turned out about the same, the older siblings have a stepmom/woman who is married to our father, the middle ones have a mother who isn't their bio-mom and my youngest sibling is her and my fathers bio kid. All my siblings are just siblings regardless of age and who the biomom is, and there hasn't been any lasting trouble from it (I was a AH teenager to my stepmom a bit when I was a teenager, but that is expected and I grew up and we got over it).\n\nPeople aren't perfect and it wouldn't be fair to say he did it on purpose but it is 100% your fathers mistake and he is a total AH for trying to pin it on you and your siblings.\n\nIf you have anything like a reasonable relationship with your younger siblings please try to be nice to them, the fallout from this is probably going to be a lot more difficult for them than it will be for anyone else and if they feel like you hold any of this against them it will hurt them a lot.", "NTA\n\nOne day the truth IS going to come out, and the little ones (especially Jonah) are going to be very hurt that they\u2019ve been lied to and manipulated in this way.", "NTA, yeah your dad reaped what he sowed.
