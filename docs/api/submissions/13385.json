{"id": 13385, "submission_id": "124mlr4", "title": "AITA for telling my dad he feels like my siblings and I are half siblings because of choices he made?", "selftext": "So my parents had four children together. Me (19f), Jayden (17m), Remi (10f) and Jonah (6m). Five years ago we lost our mom. Four years ago dad remarried. Jayden and I didn't mind though we knew dad's wife would never be our mom. Jonah was a baby and didn't remember mom so he started to see dad's wife as his only mom. Remi sees herself as having two moms. She's not as close to dad's wife as Jonah is but doesn't see her as a non parent like Jayden and me.\n\nDad asked me and my brother not to talk about mom around Jonah in case it interfered in the relationship he built with dad's wife. He said he would know about mom but didn't need to hear all about her all the time. With Remi, he said to let her ask but try not talk about mom around her if she didn't ask. We respected that although we disagreed with his decision. He said we had years with mom. They were young enough that seeing his wife as mom would be healthier for them. He also said that his wife deserved the chance to be known as mom since she'd be raising them for the rest of their childhood and it would be over a decade for both of them.\n\nI love all my siblings. But I know Remi used to be frustrated with Jayden and me because we wouldn't celebrate dad's wife for Mother's Day, or because we would go to mom's grave without her, or we'd talk about mom without her. But again, that was what dad told us to do. Jayden even told dad it annoyed her and he told us to keep sticking to our word. When she did ask we would include her. But we also didn't share the same love for dad's wife.\n\nWith Jonah, he struggles to understand how Remi has two moms, Jayden and I are siblings but we have a different mom. About a year ago he said we were his adopted siblings and that's how he made it make sense. We started to correct him but dad cut us off. So we left it alone. It did mean that Jonah kind of put us in boxes away from him. As became clear when, for a school project recently, he drew his family with just dad and dad's wife, Remi was to the side but away from the three and Jayden and I were completely separate. He told his teacher that we were adopted siblings but not really since we didn't have the same parents and how his real family was his mom and dad.\n\nThis is when dad commented to Jayden and me that it feels like we're half siblings instead of just siblings. That our relationship is not what he thought it would be. I told him that that is because of his choices. That his desire to override mom for Jonah, and for us to keep quiet around Remi unless she asked, means feelings and confusion have separated us. Dad told me it wasn't fair to blame him and if Jayden and I had just been more open to a second mother none of this would have happened.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680005002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124mlr4/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_feels_like_my_siblings/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone needs therapy.", "NTA. You are correct that your dad is just now seeing the consequences of the paths he's set you all on. I'm sure there was a much better way for him to handle this by him by not downplaying the role of your mom. Him leading your youngest sibling to believe that you guys are adopted is an appalling deception which will lead to all sorts of issues when he finds out the truth.", "NTA. Wow your younger siblings will have much to unpack in their future.", "NTA\n\nBy following his wishes, a wedge was driven through your family.", "NTA\n\nYou warned your dad about what was happening but he insisted.

Know this: You will feel better one day.\n\nYour dad has made a common and well-intentioned mistake here. By asking you never to speak of your mother in certain company, and demanding Mothers Day tribute for his wife - he is asking you to erase your mother and, in the case of your youngest brother, forget her. That isn\u2019t going to work.  This approach to replacing a parent just breeds resentment.", "NTA Hes going to have an even bigger shock when your siblings realise that all of this is your dads doing.\n\nHow does your step-mom feel about this?

As a grown man, for him to blame his children for his screw up as a father is both hilarious yet not very surprising. Sounds about right. So don't worry about it, eventually the replacement wife is gonna have to take the heat. Especially after you leave.", "NTA. Wow, Dad was just as traumatized by the loss but maybe in his effort to find a new parent for Remi and Jonah, he really didn\u2019t think about how what he asked you to do was so fucked up. There\u2019s always room to love and remember our loved ones who have left us AND accept new loved ones in our lives.", "Nah, he can't blame you guys for not seeing his second wife as your mom. I can see where he's coming from, not wanting to confuse the younger ones, but that wasn't the right way to approach this and he should've noticed much sooner.\n\nNTA from me.", "NTA Not everyone knows how to handle such things and much of it is trial & error. The youngest two are now old enough to understand and no reason not to be spoken about openly with them. The 6 year old, of course, mind needs to be handled more sensitively than the older one. You're not though the parent but maybe you can make your dad understand. Hopefully your stepmother is respectful of your mother's memory. People shouldn't feel they have to choose, love is limitless. I hope none of you feel it's any type of contest. 'Steps' can be acknowledged on special days even when celebrating the biological ones.", "NTA.

In my opinion, no one here is   \nnecessarily an asshole (NAH), but there are some communication issues   \nthat need to be addressed. It's understandable that your dad wants to   \ncreate a stable and healthy environment for your younger siblings, but   \nit seems that his approach has caused some tension between you and your   \nolder brother.

He tried to say all related through him but failed to see where confusion would come in when Jonah didn't understand different moms, multiple ones and living together but \"claiming different moms\". I'm pretty sure he attempted to make it simple. But simple in a full grown man's head is not always going to be simple to a five year old child.", "I don't see that happening. Especially because he would have to face the reality that who mom is to all of us is not only different, but has led to some very complicated feelings in two young kids. As well as a feeling of being left out.", "Yeah, I agree with you there. I think his wish was for me and Jayden to fall in love with his wife and maybe that by being a good mom to the younger ones, we'd love her just as much for that reason alone. But I could never claim anyone as another mom. Jayden feels pretty much the same. We had a very much established and loving relationship with mom and nobody could ever compare or get close to that again.", "I already moved out. I'm in college but I do try to visit to at least see my siblings.", "She's on board with having the chance to be the only mom to my two youngest siblings. She was upset, and I think even a little annoyed, that Jayden and I never gave her the chance to be a mom to us. But she's not against it in any way.", "No, he wasn't with her when mom was still alive. They didn't know each other back then either. They met about five months after mom died. At a BBQ we all attended.", "Jayden (brother closest in age to me) and I are close. We're the closest of the four of us. Maybe the only ones you could actually describe as being close. But it has caused some tension between us and our sister and then a distance and confusion with our youngest brother.", "He tried to make it simple but it's just not, in his scheme your mom both exists and doesn't exist at the same time, even a sci-fi fanatic wouldn't grasp it well. The only thing I'll say is I really don't think he's as bad as some others here do. I feel like he just knew how much your mom's passing hurt you all, and simply wanted to protect the younger 2 kids from that as much as possible. He probably thought that because you and Jayden understood what has happened, that there was no shielding you, but maybe he could shield the other 2. It's clear to you (and to him now in hindsight) it was a big mistake, but it can't be undone sadly. You're definitely not an asshole for telling him the truth, and he's definitely TA for trying to pin blame on you. \n\nI'm sure you don't particularly want to argue with your dad over this topic, but it's worth considering that Remi and Jonah will piece things together at some point and be hurt. It's worth staying on his case to get him to be honest with them gradually, and straighten things out for them, even if it's hard for you, it will be good for your younger siblings. \n\nLike many others here suggested, I think group therapy would be very beneficial.", "Then it\u2019s on both of them completely, the major problem is that and Jayden are now complicit in the lies so if/when the two youngest really find out what\u2019s gone on you\u2019ll be part of the blame.\n\nThis is an absolutely despicable thing for them to do, not only is he lying to the two youngest but he\u2019s actively putting a wedge between you all as siblings. Then has the gall to wonder why it\u2019s all going wrong when he\u2019s banning the topic of your mother from ever being talked about.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be surprised when you and Jayden cut contact from him and stepmom for all this.", "They are both majorly fucked up and emotionally cruel to the two of you.", "Sorry - it just seemed as though he moved on really quickly. New wife, don't talk about the old one, etc. You are NTA, but I think your father is a bit of one. For most people, the first year or two after a death are the worst and you were already being asked to welcome a \"new mom\" to the fold. I think that was completely unfair and that your father handled it poorly.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss. The loss of a parent is one that you feel at some level for the rest of your life. It's sad that you could not bond with your own siblings over the loss of your mother.", "I'm sorry to hear that your relationship with your siblings has been affected by your dad's decision to prioritize his new wife's role as a mother figure for your younger siblings. It's understandable that it has caused tension and confusion, especially for the younger ones who may not fully understand the situation. It's good to hear that you and your brother Jayden have a close relationship, but it's also important to try and bridge the gap with your other siblings if possible. Have you talked to your dad about how his decisions have affected your family dynamic? Maybe an open and honest conversation could help clarify things and bring you all closer together.", "We were still kids when this all started. Not very many choices there. I'd tell them the truth in a heartbeat but don't want to fuck up their childhoods even more because I think dad would be angry enough to cut me off, maybe even Jayden, and then they wouldn't have us for support after a truth drop like that.", "He did. I think he actively wanted that for my younger two siblings. They were at ages where the chances for her to be just mom were greater. I think it kills him a bit that Remi acknowledges two mom's. I think he was hoping she and Jonah would share the love for only one mom, his wife. It's fucked up. But I get that Jayden and I had mom for longer. Still, it has sucked to know my youngest brother doesn't even know she is his mom, and that she's just some random woman who's our mom. And it sucks that Remi has felt so isolated because of what dad had us do. Mom never would have wanted any of this.", "We have tried talking to him. He reminded us that he was the parent and that we agreed to follow what he said. That's about as far as we got with that.", "I know that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s despicable, he\u2019s forced you both into an awful situation just so he and his new wife can try playing happy families.", ">We have tried talking to him.
