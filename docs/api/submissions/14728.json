First time he proposed, we were hungover on our couch. No ring, no money, he was in his boxers, so much love. I said YES, cried.\nWe saved and picked out a ring and paid it off. It arrived from eBay while I was on a business trip. I walked in with my suitcase, he was kneeling in entry hall.\n\nSame boxers, ring in hand. I said YES again, cried. \nFor some background, I\u2019m a woman that loves big gestures. Big celebrations, all the glitter, spotlight, attention. I throw big birthday parties and celebrations for everyone I love. \n\nI had always dreamed of a bigger, splashier proposal but this was more his vibe - low key, just the two of us, at home. I was so in love I didn\u2019t mind. \n\nAnd this was 2006, before the outrageous prom-posals and insta drone videos and tiktoks set to music snippets that stoked my jealousy of these over the top proposals!\n\nFast forward - 15 years of marriage, 4 kids, 1 restaurant, 7 moves. We\u2019ve lived some adventures!!! Still super in love.\n\nI turned 46 on 4/6. \n\nHe surprised me with an epic getaway to a 3 Michelin \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f restaurant, it was incredible!!! I was glowing and so grateful. He planned it all from start to finish with zero help or input from me, something that had been an issue for us - that I always had to be the organizer for everything. \n\nThe weekend was Perfect!!!!\n\nTonight I arrived home after a business trip. Been up since 6 am. He worked today, still in his polo with work logo.\n\nI\u2019m on the couch and he calls all the kids in the living room. \n\nTells me to close my eyes and hands me a Mailed package addressed to him. It\u2019s a Tupperware container wrapped in tape.\nAnd a knife.\n\nHas me cut it all open and pull out the bubble wrap. \nThere\u2019s a ring box inside and my tummy drops. He\u2019s smiling and says take it out!! \n\nI hand it back and say no. Who gets THREE chances to do this right??!! \nPlease don\u2019t do this like this in front of the kids. The boys will LEARN from you how to make an effort!! And make something special!!\n\nHe insists so I open it, it\u2019s a gorgeous new diamond ring. I do he kneels down, gives me the ring. \nI put it on and kiss him but inside I\u2019m SCREAMMMMMMMING. \n\nHe can tell I\u2019m not happy and gets upset saying that this is the opposite of what he was trying to achieve. I explained that the effort matters as much as the gift, I didn\u2019t need the ring - it\u2019s beautiful - but saving it and giving it to me during our family photo shoot in May or on Sat night while we are out to dinner with friends this weekend for my birthday \u2026 ANY of that would have been better!!!!\n\nHe said he was excited to give it to me and now I\u2019ve ruined it. That the ring is the present.\n\nI\u2019m SO fucking sad that he doesn\u2019t get it STILL after 20 years. Yes I love the ring, but i didn\u2019t need it. His effort matters more! The weekend away was more than enough. \nAITA??!!!!!!!!", "created_utc": 1681431574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lcr31/aita_hubs_gave_me_a_new_after_15_yrs_tonight_im/", "score": 399, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jesus, talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth. He just took you on a giant trip. The big gesture was literally just made. The effort was put in. And then on *top of that, h*e got you an expensive ring. It seems that all you care about is looking good in front of other people and you don't actually care about him at all. \n\nYou want people fawning over you on Tiktok. You don't actually want a husband. The narcissism is astonishing.\n\nTell your husband there are women on the internet that appreciate him if he decides to move on.", "I had to reread this because I couldn't understand why you were upset.

The fact that he took you on a wonderful trip that you also loved and didn\u2019t have to plan?\n\nI think it\u2019s so sweet that each time your husband proposes, he does so at home in a low-key way, reminiscent of the first time he proposed. That\u2019s honestly really romantic.\n\nAnd even if that\u2019s not what he\u2019s thinking\u2026 Your relationship isn\u2019t lived for Instagram and Tik Tok, is it? Why do you need an elaborate proposal to feel valued in your relationship of twenty years? Is the love, life, and family you share not enough? And then to insinuate that your husband is being a bad example to your sons by giving you a gift in a private, family setting rather than during an over-the-top public display for the \u2018gram\u2026 Honestly, that\u2019s absurd. If anything, a public display would be a bad example for them\u2014teaching them to value \u201clikes\u201d and upvotes, rather than to cherish the real feeling of love enjoyed between two people.\n\nPlease get a grip.", "YTA - Hard YTA - Someone is extremely shallow, and it's not your husband.", "YTA - Damn.

I read all of this and I don\u2019t understand what your issue is here\u2026? You realize if you wanted some ridiculous proposal you didn\u2019t actually have to say yes when he made a low-key one? You have a problem with him setting a low bar in front of your kids\u2026 when there are plenty of people out there who would be mortified by a huge public proposal?

That being said, your love language and what you want is okay. I hope your husband can see this and work towards it.", "NTA he once again chose the gesture that he wanted...to make to you. I get it, he even way overspent and STILL failed the most basic function of a gift, to make someone feel known and appreciated. That said, some people are just lousy at gifts. Sounds like one disappointment in a basically great relationship.", "NTA.  It would have taken him 5 extra minutes to open, and present it to you in a better way.  He did all that work and them just....didn't finish.  I would also be upset.  The gift is lovely but as you said, the GESTURE was more important to you.   Nothing is less appealing, less romantic than being handed a mailer and some scissors in front of an audience, and being told to open up.", "I'm going to be the odd man out here. \n\nNTA\n\nLike you said, who gets three chances to do it the way that you want it and does it their way every time. He didn't like grandioise, so he didn't do it the 1st time or the 2nd time. But at some point, doesn't it seem like he could have given your dream proposal a try? \n\n Had he gotten no ring you wouldn't have felt a loss, But getting the ring without getting the proposal you've dreamed of your entire life for the third time is kind of a punch in the gut. I am assuming here that at some point during this 20 years together, you've mentioned to him that you wish you'd had the extravagant proposal.\n\nIf this is the first time he would have heard about that dream, then everything else I said should be ignored. But if he knew and he had ignored that, not once, not twice but 3 times.

First time he proposed, we were hungover on our couch. No ring, no money, he was in his boxers, so much love. I said YES, cried.\nWe saved and picked out a ring and paid it off. It arrived from eBay while I was on a business trip. I walked in with my suitcase, he was kneeling in entry hall.\nSame boxers, ring in hand. I said YES again, cried. \nFor some background, I\u2019m a woman that loves big gestures. Big celebrations, all the glitter, spotlight, attention. I throw big birthday parties and celebrations for everyone I love. \nI had always dreamed of a bigger, splashier proposal but this was more his vibe - low key, just the two of us, at home. I was so in love I didn\u2019t mind. \nAnd this was 2006, before the outrageous prom-posals and insta drone videos and tiktoks set to music snippets that stole my jealousy of these over the top proposals!\nFast forward - 15 years of marriage, 4 kids, 1 restaurant, 7 moves. We\u2019ve lived some adventures!!! Still super in love.\nI turned 46 on 4/6. \nHe surprised me with an epic getaway to a 3 Michelin \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f restaurant, it was incredible!!! I was glowing and so grateful. He planned it all from start to finish with zero help or input from me, something that had been an issue for us - that I always had to be the organizer for everything. \nThe weekend was Perfect!!!!.\nTonight I arrived home after a business trip. Been up since 6 am. He worked today, still in his polo with work logo.\nI\u2019m on the couch and he calls all the kids in the living room. \nTells me to close my eyes and hands me a Mailed package addressed to him. It\u2019s a Tupperware container wrapped in tape.\nAnd a knife.\nHas me cut it all open and pull out the bubble wrap. \nThere\u2019s a ring box inside and my tummy drops. He\u2019s smiling and says take it out!! \nI hand it back and say no. Who gets THREE chances to do this right??!! \nPlease don\u2019t do this like this in front of the kids. The boys will LEARN from you how to make an effort!! And make something special!!\nHe insists so I open it, it\u2019s a gorgeous new diamond ring. I do he kneels down, gives me the ring. \nI put it on and kiss him but inside I\u2019m SCREAMMMMMMMING. \nHe can tell I\u2019m not happy and gets upset saying that this is the opposite of what he was trying to achieve. I explained that the effort matters as much as the gift, I didn\u2019t need the ring - it\u2019s beautiful - but saving it and giving it to me during our family photo shoot in May or on Sat night while we are out to dinner with friends this weekend for my birthday \u2026 ANY of that would have been better!!!!\nHe said he was excited to give it to me and now I\u2019ve ruined it. That the ring is the present.\nI\u2019m SO fucking sad that he doesn\u2019t get it STILL after 20 years. Yes I love the ring, but i didn\u2019t need it. His effort matters more!

So ironic she\u2019ll be lucky if they grow up to be anything like her husband.", "The same boxers was the second proposal. This is the third.", "Yeah and she\u2019s posting on the internet for clout. If it didn\u2019t matter, she wouldn\u2019t have mentioned social media and she wouldn\u2019t have posted here to try to make lemonade out of her lemons.", "For some people, the ring and the effort in choosing and purchasing one makes them feel special. For others, it's a lot less about the ring being special and more about the experience being special. You are likely the former while OP is the latter.", "Wow you're mad.", "But she likes the ring, and her husband was obviously attempting to surprise her with him. She would have wanted the ring if he had given it to her publicly. Her issue seems to be that he just didn\u2019t give it to her in a special, public way. Which I don\u2019t think is reasonable to get upset over. \n\nAnd I agree that unpackaging your own present is a little lacklustre, but not enough for this kind of rant.", "Exactly this. What\u2019s even more telling is the writer\u2019s reaction to the comments when they\u2019re called out for their actions. \n\nThough one thing reddit needs to be wary of is bandwagoning opinions and \u201cwitch hunting\u201d. Sometimes these threads take a nasty turn to hivemind echo chambers", "Oh look, you replied to the one person who agrees with you. \n\nWhy are you here? You\u2019ve been judged. Accept it and use it to better yourself. Start by apologizing to your husband.", "You are delusional... There is a post in here that mentions digging down and figuring out why this all matters to you... I really suggest you do that, because there's definitely something missing from your life, and it's not the husband... he's doing everything right, and yet you still nitpick over the smallest of things... the fact that he went through the effort of the planned trip and meal, the effort of getting the perfect ring for you, and the sentimental act of having your kids there to witness this moment, and it still isn't enough for you??? Who exactly are you trying to impress???? \n\nYour husband deserves better... and so do your kids... because if they grow up with your thought process on life, they are doomed.", "The kids need to learn, if they are boys, do not look for someone like mom.", "It\u2019s solid advice.", "In what way? How does knowing and sharing what makes me feel loved make me immature?", "She threw that in there to make it sound ever so slightly less narcissistic. Won\u2019t somebody think about the CHILDREN?\n\nNope.", "I agree!! Sounds like a nice guy that was really excited to give her this gift. And also just took her for a great weekend.. I just don\u2019t get it", "No shit. Where did I say it was the third??", "Why would I reply to people who think I\u2019m an asshole?! \ud83d\ude06Regardless, I did a few. One of them suggested he may have been trying to recreate the original proposal and I didn\u2019t even think of that, so I\u2019m hearing other perspectives to help me understand his POV.", "This whole post is about the third proposal", ">Why would I reply to people who think I\u2019m an asshole?!\n\nYou came here to ask. The consensus is you are.\n\nRejecting reality doesn't help lol", "\u201cWhy would I reply to people who think I\u2019m an asshole?!\u201d\n\nLady, what do you think this place is?", "You suck.", "You literally came to the AITA subreddit\u2026.you asked a question, are you the assailed, but it seems you really just want people to agree with you. This isn\u2019t the place to expect that", "I am so angry for your husband. You seem very controlling and nitpicky, narcissistic and selfish. I wonder, what grand gestures of romance have you done for your husband?", "YTA. How are you even married. Lol.", "Because replying to people who have a different perspective is what this is about. You sound very exhausting as a person, boo hoo my husband didn't spend hundreds of dollars for me to get a perfect Instagram photo to brag to all my friends about. Jeeze he did a romantic gesture in an intimate way not all people need to one-up others to be happy. Grow up.", "Because maybe you'd learn something. Oh my god you are the worst.", "How are you married for 20 years and 46 fucking years old and you don't understand your husband's POV? Its baffling you need strangers to do this for you. Also why are you on here instead of having a conversation that should've been had YEARS ago???\n\nYTA", "You realize if the overwhelming majority of the subreddit says you\u2019re the asshole (which you are, major YTA), you\u2019re probably the asshole right?\n\nThe whole point of posting in this sub is to get an honest and unbiased opinion from strangers. And you did.", "why did you post this here of all places then ?", "Literally the worst lmfao", "I don\u2019t know, because you literally came to a place called \u201cam I the asshole?\u201d But also, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m an asshole, even though I totally am!\u201d", "You posted on a sub where people judge you on being an asshole or not. You should respond to valid criticism, not just the ones you like. Please get off tiktok, it\u2019s rotting your idea of what love is.", "That\u2019s literally the point of this sub.", "You are a social media obsessed narcissist. I feel sorry for your husband.", "Because you're asking strangers if you're TA.\n\nIf you ignore the people who say \"yes,\" then you didn't come here to understand shit, you came here to be validated and now that you're seeing that no one agrees with you, you're dismissing everyone else.\n\nThe whole world is wrong but you.\n\nAstonishing narcissism.", "You suck."]}
