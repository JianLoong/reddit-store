I got medium nude oval nails: not extremely long, but just not my normal length. After I came back home, my bf saw them and stopped talking to me, saying he dislikes it so much and doesn\u2019t want to be judgy so he\u2018d rather not say anything. I was fine with it, cause he has ADHD and change is hard for him, so I decided to wait a bit. But know it\u2019s getting out of hand. It\u2019s been around 24h now, and he doesn\u2019t speak to me, doesn\u2019t look at me, doesn\u2019t hug (i tried hugging at night and he didn\u2019t hug me back, just laid there visibly uncomfortable). \n\nI tried to speak to him in the morning, saying I don\u2019t get the situation and want clarity, since I feel distanced and lonely and pushed away. He said, that is exactly what is happening, because my hands we perfectly aesthetic to him before (short, usually dark red nails) and now my whole appearance and I am in generally are ruined for him. And also he said, I knew he disliked this style, so I should have known better. \n\n-> I spoke to my friends, sister, mom and a very critical dad, if it was ok. All of them said it look good on me and really suits me. Again: I expected my critical dad to say, I look like a whore for having this style, but he said it\u2019s really nice and elegant. \n\n-> The style I am talking about is \u201cnude medium nails\u201d if you want to look at it on Pinterest \n\n-> My bf has adhd and I new he doesn\u2019t like change and this style. I wanted to try it for over two years now and I like it. My next nails are going to be my normal style, since I do a lot of sports and it\u2019s simply impractical. \n\nAITH for doing the style he doesn\u2019t like?\n\n\nUPD: thank you all! I did thought it was a tad controlling, but wanted to see if adhd/not asking mean the same to you as it does to him.

Your boyfriend on the other hand is the AH big time. I am neurodivergent myself and in my opinion, no condition in which you are still self aware and capable of feeling empathy and or learning how to treat other people with respect excuses this type of behaviour. He is using his ADHD as an excuse to be rude, controlling and cruel to you. Not dealing well with change is something I can understand, but it is his responsibility to try and find ways to cope with this. I think it's also important that you are aware of this and show him empathy and support, but his behaviour is inexcusable. It is your body and you are allowed to change things about yourself to feel confident. Sure, it might be good to discuss bigger changes ahead of time, but as a means of preparation, not to ask for permission!! \n\nI'm not sure if this is accurate, but it might help you to examine your self confidence and the way people around you speak to you.

Because of my STBX I didn't wear nail polish for 5 years. He disclosed that particular phobia the day before our wedding, 2.5 years into our relationship. Stupidly I agreed to go through with the marriage, with my nails bare. Interestingly enough, he never had an issue with other people wearing nail polish. He self-diagnosed to be on the autism spectrum, but has never sought a formal evaluation or tried to find coping mechanisms that wouldn't limit me.\n\nHe was loving and seemed chill when we met, but he became uncomfortable with more and more things about me as I became more invested in the relationship. I would then adjust. Other things he did and said made me perpetually afraid I was an overbearing and controlling person. Arguments always ended up with him giving me a silent treatment until I apologised.\n \nI finally left in January and have since met tons of people who think I'm fun to be around. I can wear and do whatever I like. Plus, I recently got a promotion because of how much my confidence improved. The divorce should be finalised in about 2 weeks.\n\nMy only regret is how much time I spent bending over backwards trying to not trigger him and trying to make the marriage work. I wasted my last fertile years on him. Don't be me. You're young, live your life the way you want. Don't change yourself for any man. Be yourself and the one who likes you the way you are will find you. Good luck! \ud83d\ude42\n\nEdit: Controlling things he said and did eventually escalated into him waking me up by punching the door of the room I slept in that night after we had an argument.

It's not the sort of reaction I would have to, say, clothing in a style I don't favor.  It's more like the reaction I would have to open wounds or parasites.  (I don't know why.  I don't think I was ever traumatized as a child by someone with red nails or anything like that.)\n\nIf I were in a relationship with someone who knew this and still chose to paint her nails red, I would be disgusted and I would also be hurt that she apparently didn't care about me enough to avoid putting me into that situation.", "I have ADHD and, maybe mine is different from gis, but when I say \"change bothers me,\" I mean like if I had to move to a new apartment or if I have to drive someone else's car and it's vastly different from mine.

Many woman wear those, I wouldn't even notice.\n\nBut after looking at those pictures and going into detail, I understand that people could be grossed out by them.

This is controlling and a major overreaction.
