I got medium nude oval nails: not extremely long, but just not my normal length. After I came back home, my bf saw them and stopped talking to me, saying he dislikes it so much and doesn\u2019t want to be judgy so he\u2018d rather not say anything. I was fine with it, cause he has ADHD and change is hard for him, so I decided to wait a bit. But know it\u2019s getting out of hand. It\u2019s been around 24h now, and he doesn\u2019t speak to me, doesn\u2019t look at me, doesn\u2019t hug (i tried hugging at night and he didn\u2019t hug me back, just laid there visibly uncomfortable). \n\nI tried to speak to him in the morning, saying I don\u2019t get the situation and want clarity, since I feel distanced and lonely and pushed away. He said, that is exactly what is happening, because my hands we perfectly aesthetic to him before (short, usually dark red nails) and now my whole appearance and I am in generally are ruined for him. And also he said, I knew he disliked this style, so I should have known better. \n\n-> I spoke to my friends, sister, mom and a very critical dad, if it was ok. All of them said it look good on me and really suits me. Again: I expected my critical dad to say, I look like a whore for having this style, but he said it\u2019s really nice and elegant. \n\n-> The style I am talking about is \u201cnude medium nails\u201d if you want to look at it on Pinterest \n\n-> My bf has adhd and I new he doesn\u2019t like change and this style. I wanted to try it for over two years now and I like it. My next nails are going to be my normal style, since I do a lot of sports and it\u2019s simply impractical. \n\nAITH for doing the style he doesn\u2019t like?\n\n\nUPD: thank you all! I did thought it was a tad controlling, but wanted to see if adhd/not asking mean the same to you as it does to him. I guess I am gonna have an important discussion with him tonight.", "created_utc": 1669464587, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z562v2/aita_for_getting_the_nails_my_bf_doesnt_like/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His ADHD is not an excuse for being an asshole.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s allowed to not like something; he\u2019s allowed to voice his opinion. Fake nails are temporary, so I don\u2019t know what his big deal is. Change is difficult, but nails are such a minor change. He\u2019s overreacting over nothing. You do you, but ditch the guy. That\u2019s major red flags. Especially since you have to make excuses for him pushing you away like that.", "NTA.\nI also feel like his ADHD is a crappy excuse... it's one thing to not like change and need to get used to them. But his reaction is completely over the top! \nHow would he react if you got a haircut or whatever?", "They\u2019re your friggin\u2019 nails. If your BF reacts this badly to a change this minor \u2026 is it that he is not managing his ADHD or that he\u2019s a controlling AH? In either case, you are NTA.", "NTA. ADHD doesn\u2019t make you controlling over something that\u2019s easily changeable and shouldn\u2019t be a decision for him to make; he\u2019s using it as an excuse to be a dick.", "NTA. I have ADHD and it is no excuse for this behavior. He is literally shunning you for your fingernail choice. He is being absolutely ridiculous. The silent treatment and withholding affection to \u201cpunish\u201d you is abusive and manipulating.", "NTA, and you know it. Take a step back and really look at this situation, he's causing a major issue over the way a super small part of body temporarily looks like.... \n\nI could get if he openly says it doesn't look good or doesn't like it but to go as far as the silent treatment and refusing to hug you? Like come on... seriously", "NTA. I am baffled by such an extreme reaction to nails. However, I would find this reaction to any change one partner made in their appearance controlling.  What will happen if you want to change your hairstyle or make another change in your appearance? Are you always going to walk on eggshells? \n\nYou need to think about if his unwillingness to allow you to have the autonomy to make decisions about your appearance is something you want to live with the rest of your life. He is punishing you because you changed your fingernail style to one you wanted to try. His reaction is a red flag.", "Answer this honestly: how many concessions do you make for/because of him? \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Does this also mean when you decide to change a hairstyle or lipstick color there is potential for him to shun you? What does he do when he has a cashier, bar tender or physician who has longer nails? Turn and run? \n\nIt boils down to this: How much of your autonomy are you willing to sacrifice in this relationship? Only you can say if this behavior is going to be tolerated or not.", "NTA and if this is typical of your relationship that sounds awful and controlling. You're a person who deserves to be able to express herself without someone punishing you for not being his \"aesthetic\".", "Nta. You can change your appearance to however you like. But talk about an overreaction to just nails, sheesh", "NTA. Now imagine how he'll react to: A cut-and-dye at the hair salon. A change of itinerary plans on a family vacation. You wanting to explore other career fields.\n\nYou're never going to be able to do anything without his approval lest he gives you the silent treatment until you cave. If he's willing to do it over your fingernails, I'm willing to bet he'll do it over anything.", "NTA keep the nails, ditch the AH", "NTA \u2014 he is being controlling. Leave now while it\u2019s just about the nails. And also, if your dad is someone who is likely to call you a whore, drop him too.", "NTA.\n\nThey\u2018re your nails and you\u2018re free to do with them what YOU like and what makes YOU feel good.\n\nYour bf shouldn\u2019t be such an asshole.", "NTA for sure. Your boyfriend on the other hand is the AH big time. I am neurodivergent myself and in my opinion, no condition in which you are still self aware and capable of feeling empathy and or learning how to treat other people with respect excuses this type of behaviour. He is using his ADHD as an excuse to be rude, controlling and cruel to you. Not dealing well with change is something I can understand, but it is his responsibility to try and find ways to cope with this. I think it's also important that you are aware of this and show him empathy and support, but his behaviour is inexcusable. It is your body and you are allowed to change things about yourself to feel confident. Sure, it might be good to discuss bigger changes ahead of time, but as a means of preparation, not to ask for permission!! \n\nI'm not sure if this is accurate, but it might help you to examine your self confidence and the way people around you speak to you. A father calling his own daughter a whore is absolutely disgusting and your boyfriend saying 'you're ruined for him' is horrible. Nobody should have the right to say any of these things to you. But when you're so used to hearing those things it's easy to forget that is isn't normal. I wish you all the best", "NTA ADHD has nothing to do with him being an AH", "His actual diagnosis is \u201casshole\u201dand judging by your description of your father calling you a whore, you\u2019ve been raised to think this is acceptable. Neither of these \u201cmen\u201d are worthy of your efforts to please them.", "Nta. He doesn't control your body or you for that matter. If you want to change it up and try something knew, you can. I know exactly what your nails look like and they are one of my favorites. Keep them. The bf ignoring you like this is pretty abusive to me. I'd rethink the relationship because who knows what else may happen If you change something else or try something knew. Change is good and also trying something knew. The bf is an AH.\n\nQuestion: does he get mad when you don't discuss things with him? For instance changing your nails up?\n\nEdit: spelling and added question", "NTA. But you need to get OUT of this relationship and get therapy ASAP. The fact that you were \u201cfine with it because he has ADHD\u201d and the fact that you expected your DAD to say you \u201clook like a whore\u201d is extremely indicative of how you lack boundaries and self confidence. \nYou deserve soooo much more love in your life.", "NTA\n\nIt's not a big deal to get something different than you usually get. Your boyfriend is acting very weird by this. I personally love my nails dark but I'll go with a light color every once in awhile.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is being controlling. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to get your nails done how you want. If your boyfriend thinks your nails have ruined you, it\u2019s time to lose him", "I have ADHD. That's NOT the problem. \n\nHis behavior is controlling. He is treating you like crap because your hands were part of your aesthetic? So your nail polish is more important to him than your humanity. Is he going to do this if you get a hair cut? Change hair color? Get an outfit he doesn't like? Gain 10 lbs? Get old? \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nIf nails cause him to acted this way.

It\u2019s about power/control and punishment. He\u2019s scary and wants to dominate you and your decisions the fact that he puts his personal preference above yours is disturbing.\n\nIt\u2019s a giant red flag and I hope you take a hard look at him because his actions are not love.", "NTA.

In some of the pictures you refer to the exact match in color makes the nails look like the actual fingers just got longer and pointier in a bit of a creepy way.\n\nNot saying this is the case, just trying to understand why someone could have such a strong reaction to nails.\n\nEdit: it could also be a sensory issue.

Sounds controlling af.", "He is usually not happy about change, but says that I look nice. But again, if it matches his expectations about me I guess. He doesn\u2019t like when I dress up, because he feels dressed down and I actually don\u2019t do much: just makeup + accessories, I don\u2019t even wear heels.", "my fiance shaved his head summer of 2021 and while i HATED it, i would never be angry at it or withdraw affection or communication or even bring it up after the inital first reaction just because my partner changed his looks. OP's boyfriend is super controlling and i hope he gets his butt in check real soon", "I guess a lot and all the time. Many of those are small that I don\u2019t mind, like where the kettle stands, and revolve around our household. It\u2019s a different matter, but I though it\u2019s normal?\n\nHe just calls me selfish if I don\u2019t do that, but he rarely does things just for me - like we never watch a movie that I like and he doesn\u2019t, tho it\u2019s often the other way around", "Kinda done already. I talk to him and mom to stay in touch with my siblings who I adore (we live in different countries). And I really wanted the rudest and most open opinion possible, so I asked the dad. If he is fine with it, the nails are fine on it\u2019s own.", "Thank you for your support!\n\nHe does get mad, when I do things without talking to him first. In this case, he knew I am going to a salon, so that info should have been enough. \n\nI didn\u2019t ask him for approval on the long nails, since a) he would not approve and I would have a convo \u201cwhy ask for advice, when you are not going to take it\u201d which is fair, so I didn\u2019t ask. b) I wanted to have my own opinion on it. And honestly, they are fun, but I like my own style better. \n\nI am just so confused by this reaction, cause I see he tries to be considerate by not talking bad about my choice, but not talking at all\u2026 that\u2019s too far and saying that me as a person is now ruined for him.. we are \u201cengaged\u201d with a promised ring, it\u2019s a serious relationship, it should not boil down to a nail style. \n\nI once colored my dark brown hair into almost black with a temporary dye and he was shocked for a couple hours - but didn\u2019t ignore me and just joked a bit (fully adequate reaction to that situation since the results surprised me too and I aimed for something else), so I thought that is what is going to happen now.", "It\u2019s lighter then the skin tone, like milky-half transparent-pinkish", "That\u2019s absolutely not okay for him to say.

Read and reread what you wrote.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not normal. My husband has a weird hang up about hanging things on the banister to go upstairs. It really bothers him, so I try to avoid doing it. To compromise, I agreed not to let things stay there for more than an hour. The worst that happens is he asks if I\u2019m going to take the item up.", "Ahhh but you see, when your hair turned out differently to the way you planned, he magnanimously let that go because it was accidental. But you got your nails this way DELIBERATELY and therefore you must be punished!\n\nThe real thing you need to consider is if you want to be controlled and abused by his moods for the rest of your life. So take the time to make sure you\u2019re sure before continuing the relationship and committing any further. And don\u2019t fall for the sunk cost fallacy (I\u2019ve invested so much time/emotion/effort etc. into this relationship, I can\u2019t leave now!) because it is utter bullshit. It\u2019s much more draining emotionally and financially to get a divorce than to break up beforehand.\n\nNTA.\n\nETA: I have ADHD too and while there are some things that can make me uncomfortable, I don\u2019t go around giving the silent treatment because I like to think I\u2019m not an asshole, and am actually a mature adult."]}
