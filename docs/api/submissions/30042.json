I stopped getting cakes for my birthday after my mum made me give mine to my cousins. She said I got some of their cake so I had to \"share\". Sharing meant giving it away, the only thing I got for my birthday. I got one slice. What really pissed me off is that my cousins dictated who got to have some of their cake and everyone but me got a slice. Everyone let this happen. I remember one year I demanded a Vector Cycle instead of a cake. I was able to get the cycle eventually, but it took a lot. The next year it was a cake or nothing. I chose nothing. It was easier. \n\nI didn't get gifts. Mum stopped giving me gifts after I asked her for two power ranger toys and she gave me Barbies. I was not happy. They were 100% for her, not me. I never touched them and they went straight into the box in her room. I was I think turning 8, maybe 7, I don't know. I was so sad and confused, I didn't understand why I didn't get the two things I'd asked for. They weren't as expensive as the Barbies either. \n\nMy relatives didn't get me presents, but they showered my ass hole cousins in gifts. I was told to stop being a spoiled brat when I asked why I couldn't have gifts etc. Hell even a pack of Pokemon cards was too much when they bought my cousins multiple packs weekly. \n\nDo what you want to do. Do what makes you happy. My birthdays always make me very sad. It doesn't matter how many gifts I get, how I spend the day etc, the trauma from it just being ignored and messed up so badly still hurts badly. I can't seem to shake off those old feelings. The highlight of my birthday as I grew up was making a sandwich with crisps in it, if we had any crisps. I'd make it myself for lunch. That was my own special treat for the day.   \n\nI still remember when I turned 18. Ignoring the bullcrap of the day itself, none of my classmates believed me when I told them I turned 18 months ago. Everyone else was having parties, going to the pub etc. I heard them talking about them sometimes. Me, I wasn't allowed to do anything like that, it wasn't like I had anyone to do that kind of thing with either. I had to show them my provisional licence to prove I really was 18. The look they gave me, that a big moment like that just passed by without anyone knowing or acknowledging it. When they asked about a party I thought they were crazy. They asked about presents. Again I couldn't answer them because I got nothing. We were at an age where people were starting to figure out I wasn't weird by choice, I was an abused and lonely kid. Some people were talking to me more, now they were pulling away from the mean kids they used to be scared of confronting, but we were never friends.", "NTA your family sound v toxic.", "NTA\nI would drop contact with them tbh.
