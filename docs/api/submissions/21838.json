I asked him if he had any ethical concerns about it, assuming he'd know more about it than I would. He wasn't sure what I meant and I told him that I was ignorant about it in truth but I'd heard some feminists found it controversial. The conversation fizzled out and I thought no more about it until I got a string of very angry and upset texts from my sister asking what I'd said to her boyfriend. The gist I got was that he'd looked into the topic himself and decided against it, and that they should adopt instead. I defended myself that because of the type of person that he is he probably would've come to that conclusion on his own regardless and I'm sorry I had a casual chat with my BIL?

BIL has a core set of beliefs and apparently he did not know surrogacy in this manner violated some of his personal tenets because of a conversation with you; seems like he owes you a huge thanks in this situation and your Sister is the problem because its what she wants, (not what he wants).

That's his decision, not yours, and sister displacing her unhappiness with her relationship onto you is unfair and inappropriate.", "NTA at all.\n\nThere is a reason why paid surrogates overseas are so much less expensive than using a surrogate domestically, and that reason, simply put, is exploitation. You weren't looking to \"stir shit up\", and anyone who suggests here that you were is either immature or ridiculous, because the simple fact is that *there was literally no personal benefit to you to causing trouble here, and (as evidenced by the fallout) every reason for you to not say anything and keep the peace*. But you know your BIL and that he is a deeply ethical man who cares very much about these things, and it seems like you were genuinely concerned that he and your sister were about to get involved with something that would compromise his deeply-held ethical stances, things that aren't just theoretical to him but that he has built his life around as a person.\n\nThe reality is, if he is suggesting adoption now after looking into this, then either he realised that something about surrogacy as a whole *genuinely upset him* and felt really unethical to him, in which case he has every right not to want to pursue it as a means of becoming a parent . . . or they cannot afford to do surrogacy domestically, where there are more checks and balances to ensure that surrogates are protected and not coerced or doing it out of desperation, in which case it's sad but he is being realistic. \n\nEither way, I have to admire this man as a (hopefully) future parent for looking to pursue parenthood in ways that jibe with the kind of moral person he wants to be and that are responsible choices for their family.\n\nI'm very sorry that your sister is upset, and if she doesn't want to adopt that's a legitimate conversation she should be having with her BF for sure.

So he looked into it to get more info and found out he didn\u2019t like what he found. That\u2019s not your fault. They are paid surrogates here in the USA that they could find. Your sister is just suffering from her emotional roller coaster of dealing with this and you are her current downward spiral that she\u2019s dumping all her problems blame on. Let it go and it\u2019ll go away eventually. If she keeps it up then just stop talking to her. But you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nSurrogacy, especially abroad, is very ethically ambiguous.\n\nYou said now that they\u2019re considering adoption? \nAdoption isn\u2019t 100% ethical either.\n\nI\u2019m a transracial international adoptee, and I\u2019m just going to copy a comment I wrote for another Hopeful Adoptive Parent. \n\nThis is going to be a long comment and will sound like I\u2019m being \u201canti-adoption\u201d, but I\u2019m just trying to give you all the information.\nAre you in the US?\n\nUnderstand that if you are looking to adopt domestically, especially infants, there really aren\u2019t many infants who can be adopted.\n\nAlso know that 98% of biological parents who relinquish, only do so because of temporary problems (lack of affordable/available childcare, lack of financial stability, lack of support system, etc.) As in a permanent solution was applied to a temporary problem often due to lack of social bets & uncontrollable circumstances. Basically, most infant adoptions are unnecessary.\n\nAdoption is also a tragedy - it requires the separation from the biological family, the legal changing of an identity, and a loss of heritage and sometimes culture.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking into the foster system, you should also know that it is a broken system that often unnecessarily separates families instead of helping them stay together. Ideally, reunification is the goal, but like I said - it\u2019s a broken system that doesn\u2019t keep family preservation as a main goal.\n\nThere are foster children who are TPR (terminated parent rights). While this means they legally can be adoption, it doesn\u2019t always mean that they should be. In some states, adoption requires their birth certificate to be changed- thereby severing them from  their biological connections. Additionally, there are some benefits (college aid) that apply to foster kids who age out of the system and weren\u2019t adopted.\n\nFurthermore, guardianship is also an option that isn\u2019t promoted a lot. This allows adults to care for foster children without the legal consequences of changing birth certificates or separation from biological family.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering international adoption: that is also a very unethical practice, especially if you\u2019re in the US. Many countries are restricting the US from adopting because of the violations.\n\nInternational adoptions are very predatory in the sense that home country agencies often mislead biological parents into letting them care for the child why they figure out temporary issues then turn around and let a foreign couple (often from the US) adopt them by claiming that the child is an orphan with no family.\n\nThere\u2019s also the loss of a whole home country when adopting internationally as well as the loss of heritage and culture.\n\nIf BIL or Sister wants more info, I highly recommend the Facebook Group Adoption:Facing Realities. There are some strong opinions there, and there are loads of valuable information too.", "Nta you made a good point and he realized he was ignorant as well and did research. Good for him for not putting his head in the sand when it was going to benefit himself. \n\nYour sister needs to figure herself out if she is made at you. Maybe she isn\u2019t the best partner for her bf if she is upset by this.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t tell them not to. You assumed he was aware of these things and had a conversation.  I\u2019d prob just stay out of it from now on, though.", "I mean\u2026 western people are doing many things that result in other ppl\u2019s exploitation overseas. Buying any clothes. Buying cars. Buying iphones. etc. In case they do not buy any of these I would understand the moral worry you have, but i do assume they do but these things.", "Everyone here seems to believe having an ethical situation with an overseas surrogate is literally impossible and AUTOMATICALLY EVIL EXPLOITATION.\n\nBut that's simply not true.  Just because some countries and some agencies exploit women does not mean every single woman abroad who engages in surrogacy is being exploited.\n\n\nSo the news is this - you don't know what you're talking about.  YTA.  And the reasons should be abundantly clear.\n\n\nYou didn't research the agencies in question. You didn't frame it as an avoidable problem.  You just gave your uneducated opinion.  You passed judgement, but from no authority.\n\nHave you ever searched for a surrogate?  No?  Then you know jack about it but the nonsense people talk endlessly about anything to do with procreation.  Humans are so goofy about reproductive biology.\n\nYes, women are exploited everywhere every single day.  Yet some women actually manage to provide surrogacy and change their lives and the lives of others, in countries outside the one you live in!\n\nYou got exactly what you wanted so I don't know  why you're here.  Another right hook to your sister in the very most sensitive part of her being, in a time she is seeking motherhood and to create a family.  You literally turned her own husband against her.

That in turn has led to just as many adoptees coming out saying that they now resent their adoptive parents for never allowing them the chance to have a full relationship with their birth parents. Many also recount stories of how eventually mom and dad *did* get pregnant with that \u201cmiracle baby\u201d and all of a sudden the adoptee just doesn\u2019t even seem to matter anymore.

Many agencies both foreign and domestic have been shut down in the past for ethical and legal violations.

In the US agencies do things like promise open adoption, which is not legally binding, to make these women believe they will be this huge part of thier children's lives, then close them after the baby is placed. They often forge paperwork to ignore father's rights and lie to judges that the father is \"unknown\" so he can't claim paternity.

That happens a LOT. The people who cope with that are heroes, they really are, but it's not like that is a simple low-cost thing to try out if you have trouble conceiving.

In all those ways, there is no difference. \n\nBut as long as a child remains with their biological family, they will **never** experience the losses, abandonments, indignities and injuries which are integral to apprehension and state-provided care (foster or group home model).
