I recently found out my older sister and her boyfriend have been having trouble getting pregnant. We aren't close, the only reason I know is because she asked me if I would be willing to be a surrogate for her as I am the only sibling who has had successful pregnancies (one sister is too young and the other is child free). I said no, she didn't push it and I didn't press for any other details so that was the end of the conversation. \n\nMore recently we were all visiting my parents. My BIL ended up talking to me and asking about my children so I asked in turn about their current situation. He told me they were planning on using a paid surrogate abroad. I was surprised by this. My BIL is an incredibly sensitive man, super conscious of social issues (vegan, eco-conscious, fund raises for various human rights causes etc.), he isn't annoying about it but it's a very prominent part of his personality. I asked him if he had any ethical concerns about it, assuming he'd know more about it than I would. He wasn't sure what I meant and I told him that I was ignorant about it in truth but I'd heard some feminists found it controversial. The conversation fizzled out and I thought no more about it until I got a string of very angry and upset texts from my sister asking what I'd said to her boyfriend. The gist I got was that he'd looked into the topic himself and decided against it, and that they should adopt instead. I defended myself that because of the type of person that he is he probably would've come to that conclusion on his own regardless and I'm sorry I had a casual chat with my BIL? I've been blocked now I think.\n\n\nAITA?

If you hadn't brought it up, I would bet that someone else would have.", "NTA\n\nIf you were Vegan and couldn't get any vegan take out and then found this place that had vegan take out from a different area, wouldn't you want to know that they are not really vegan???  BIL has a core set of beliefs and apparently he did not know surrogacy in this manner violated some of his personal tenets because of a conversation with you; seems like he owes you a huge thanks in this situation and your Sister is the problem because its what she wants, (not what he wants).  PS you are correct, this is going to cause issues with your sister, but not your fault.", "NTA\n\nYou just gave you Brother-In-Law information and he came to his own conclusions after verifying what you told him.", "NTA\n\nNothing you said here was controversial, rude, or particularly problematic. Boyfriend would end up fielding similar questions over the course of their lives, better he confront his views on surrogacy now than having regrets later on. Sounds like he wasn't really on board but your sister was, and now that he had a chance to look into it would prefer another option. That's his decision, not yours, and sister displacing her unhappiness with her relationship onto you is unfair and inappropriate.", "NTA at all.\n\nThere is a reason why paid surrogates overseas are so much less expensive than using a surrogate domestically, and that reason, simply put, is exploitation. You weren't looking to \"stir shit up\", and anyone who suggests here that you were is either immature or ridiculous, because the simple fact is that *there was literally no personal benefit to you to causing trouble here, and (as evidenced by the fallout) every reason for you to not say anything and keep the peace*. But you know your BIL and that he is a deeply ethical man who cares very much about these things, and it seems like you were genuinely concerned that he and your sister were about to get involved with something that would compromise his deeply-held ethical stances, things that aren't just theoretical to him but that he has built his life around as a person.\n\nThe reality is, if he is suggesting adoption now after looking into this, then either he realised that something about surrogacy as a whole *genuinely upset him* and felt really unethical to him, in which case he has every right not to want to pursue it as a means of becoming a parent . . . or they cannot afford to do surrogacy domestically, where there are more checks and balances to ensure that surrogates are protected and not coerced or doing it out of desperation, in which case it's sad but he is being realistic. \n\nEither way, I have to admire this man as a (hopefully) future parent for looking to pursue parenthood in ways that jibe with the kind of moral person he wants to be and that are responsible choices for their family.\n\nI'm very sorry that your sister is upset, and if she doesn't want to adopt that's a legitimate conversation she should be having with her BF for sure. But what you did wasn't hateful or intrusive in any way. You shared pertinent information with someone you care about, regarding something that really mattered to him. NTA.", "NTA, paid surrogacy is exploitation, especially abroad. We\u2019re getting to a point in which \u201cadopt, don\u2019t shop\u201d is about to become applicable to humans", "NTA. They both approached you first with the topic. Knowing him and knowing what you know about surrogacy, it was a fair inquiry. Don't give it another thought.", "NTA", "NTA. It sounds like her husband really wanted a baby and is now taking it out on you. All you did was ask about it, but blaming you is a lot easier than blaming her husband.", "Info...\n\nWhy were you surprised that your BIL was considering having a child via surrogate when your own sister had asked you to be their surrogate?", "NTA. You knew how he felt about those issues and all you did was make a comment that made him look deeper into it so he wouldn\u2019t regret it later. So he looked into it to get more info and found out he didn\u2019t like what he found. That\u2019s not your fault. They are paid surrogates here in the USA that they could find. Your sister is just suffering from her emotional roller coaster of dealing with this and you are her current downward spiral that she\u2019s dumping all her problems blame on. Let it go and it\u2019ll go away eventually. If she keeps it up then just stop talking to her. But you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nSurrogacy, especially abroad, is very ethically ambiguous.\n\nYou said now that they\u2019re considering adoption? \nAdoption isn\u2019t 100% ethical either.\n\nI\u2019m a transracial international adoptee, and I\u2019m just going to copy a comment I wrote for another Hopeful Adoptive Parent. \n\nThis is going to be a long comment and will sound like I\u2019m being \u201canti-adoption\u201d, but I\u2019m just trying to give you all the information.\nAre you in the US?\n\nUnderstand that if you are looking to adopt domestically, especially infants, there really aren\u2019t many infants who can be adopted.\n\nAlso know that 98% of biological parents who relinquish, only do so because of temporary problems (lack of affordable/available childcare, lack of financial stability, lack of support system, etc.) As in a permanent solution was applied to a temporary problem often due to lack of social bets & uncontrollable circumstances. Basically, most infant adoptions are unnecessary.\n\nAdoption is also a tragedy - it requires the separation from the biological family, the legal changing of an identity, and a loss of heritage and sometimes culture.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking into the foster system, you should also know that it is a broken system that often unnecessarily separates families instead of helping them stay together. Ideally, reunification is the goal, but like I said - it\u2019s a broken system that doesn\u2019t keep family preservation as a main goal.\n\nThere are foster children who are TPR (terminated parent rights). While this means they legally can be adoption, it doesn\u2019t always mean that they should be. In some states, adoption requires their birth certificate to be changed- thereby severing them from  their biological connections. Additionally, there are some benefits (college aid) that apply to foster kids who age out of the system and weren\u2019t adopted.\n\nFurthermore, guardianship is also an option that isn\u2019t promoted a lot. This allows adults to care for foster children without the legal consequences of changing birth certificates or separation from biological family.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering international adoption: that is also a very unethical practice, especially if you\u2019re in the US. Many countries are restricting the US from adopting because of the violations.\n\nInternational adoptions are very predatory in the sense that home country agencies often mislead biological parents into letting them care for the child why they figure out temporary issues then turn around and let a foreign couple (often from the US) adopt them by claiming that the child is an orphan with no family.\n\nThere\u2019s also the loss of a whole home country when adopting internationally as well as the loss of heritage and culture.\n\nIf BIL or Sister wants more info, I highly recommend the Facebook Group Adoption:Facing Realities. There are some strong opinions there, and there are loads of valuable information too.", "Nta you made a good point and he realized he was ignorant as well and did research. Good for him for not putting his head in the sand when it was going to benefit himself. \n\nYour sister needs to figure herself out if she is made at you. Maybe she isn\u2019t the best partner for her bf if she is upset by this.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t tell them not to. You assumed he was aware of these things and had a conversation.  I\u2019d prob just stay out of it from now on, though.", "I mean\u2026 western people are doing many things that result in other ppl\u2019s exploitation overseas. Buying any clothes. Buying cars. Buying iphones. etc. In case they do not buy any of these I would understand the moral worry you have, but i do assume they do but these things.", "Everyone here seems to believe having an ethical situation with an overseas surrogate is literally impossible and AUTOMATICALLY EVIL EXPLOITATION.\n\nBut that's simply not true.  Just because some countries and some agencies exploit women does not mean every single woman abroad who engages in surrogacy is being exploited.\n\n\nSo the news is this - you don't know what you're talking about.  YTA.  And the reasons should be abundantly clear.\n\n\nYou didn't research the agencies in question. You didn't frame it as an avoidable problem.  You just gave your uneducated opinion.  You passed judgement, but from no authority.\n\nHave you ever searched for a surrogate?  No?  Then you know jack about it but the nonsense people talk endlessly about anything to do with procreation.  Humans are so goofy about reproductive biology.\n\nYes, women are exploited everywhere every single day.  Yet some women actually manage to provide surrogacy and change their lives and the lives of others, in countries outside the one you live in!\n\nYou got exactly what you wanted so I don't know  why you're here.  Another right hook to your sister in the very most sensitive part of her being, in a time she is seeking motherhood and to create a family.  You literally turned her own husband against her. It's incredible and the damage is permanent.\n\nJealous much?  Get help for your vindictiveness.  Nobody buys a feigned ignorance schtick for very long.", "YTA. You stirred shit. I can't tell if you did it unconsciously or not but I can tell that's not a conversation I would have started in 1000 years. You are not your BILs spiritual advisor - you should have stayed miles away from that topic. Waving flags over what \"some feminists\" have concerns about from the outside looks like a shit atirring attempt to sabotage your sister.", "You knew what you were doing when you started this drama.  You declined being their surrogate and when they found another surrogate you deliberately torpedoed it wit zero prompting\n\nYou deserve to have your sister mad at you", "You aren't innocent here despite your protests. Y0U didn't like the idea either, and intentionally pointed out to him how other groups he valued being part of would see it.", "YTA\n\nyou did make feel your BIL feel bad about getting a surrogate mother, and destroyed your sisters wish to have a biological child", "Nta, not even remotely", "NTA. \n\nThough boyfriend might *really* want to \u201cdo his own research\u201d into some of the ethics around adoption, especially here in the US (assuming that\u2019s where you are). There\u2019s a large movement of birth mothers sharing their stories about how they felt manipulated into giving their child away at a young age when if they had just had a *little* assistance they would have *absolutely* preferred to keep their child but were constantly being fed the narrative that money automatically equals a better life for their baby, while ignoring all the evidence that shows there is great harm done to babies when you remove them from their birth mother before 6 months. That in turn has led to just as many adoptees coming out saying that they now resent their adoptive parents for never allowing them the chance to have a full relationship with their birth parents. Many also recount stories of how eventually mom and dad *did* get pregnant with that \u201cmiracle baby\u201d and all of a sudden the adoptee just doesn\u2019t even seem to matter anymore. Things he should definitely consider before they adopt, imo.", "NTA", "I am not a surrogate, but I have donated ova. I don\u2019t live in the US. Many people opt to use donors outside of the US because other countries have much stricter laws around commercial surrogates and donors. You should take some time and educate yourself.", "NTA, I'd be surprised too if someone like that would want to use a surrogate from abroad and assume they know the ethics and ins and outs.", "NTA\n\nYou were not being nosy, meddling, or moralistic. You didn\u2019t tell him how to feel, you just asked for his perspective on a topic. All you did was have a casual conversation with your BIL that accidentally exposed him to information he had not yet encountered. It\u2019s actually a good thing your conversation alerted him to the issue, because it gave him the opportunity to look into it more and form his own opinion. That his opinion doesn\u2019t align with your sister\u2019s is unfortunate, but he could (and probably would) have encountered the same information elsewhere without your involvement.", "YTA You were clearly against it. Maybe he would have come to this conclusion himself, but you stuck your nose where it didn't belong and pushed him toward it. You knew what you were doing so drop the \"I'm ignorant about it but...\" routine. I can't imagine why you and your sister aren't close. /s", "YTA. They asked you to be a surrogate and you said no, which is 100% your right and I would too. But then when they said they were going to use an overseas surrogate, you should have kept your mouth shut and not tried to talk them out of it. That's absolutely what you were doing, not 'just asking questions.' BIL and SIL are adults and capable of making their own ethical judgments, and if you're holding a cell phone or wearing fast fashion or drinking coffee or eating chocolate, you're probably benefiting from slave labor overseas. \n\nInfertility is a deeply personal and difficult situation. Stay out of other people's decision-making. If you care that much about surrogacy as an issue, do some research on ethical surrogacy and help your family locate a country or agency with acceptable ethical standards.", "YTA. \nYou actually challenged the ethics of someone\u2019s planned course of action. An uninvited intrusion at that. IF you two had a very close relationship, and IF you had been invited to give an opinion about the ethics of the situation, then OK. Otherwise, it\u2019s not.", "NTA, being vegan but being oblivious to the exploitation of surrogates is laughable.", "Nta but why is your sister having a baby with someone who can't commit to marrying her first?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
