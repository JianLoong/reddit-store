It seems incredibly short sighted & it\u2019s not a great lesson in consent when they are not able to respect your sons wishes around his personal care. His reasons are valid.

Did they need to assess the perineal area? Was he catheterized? Did he have a femoral line? I can't understand why they wouldn't let the parent do this, otherwise. It literally makes the nurse's job easier.\n\nAs for the gender of the nurse impacting washing care, where I work we don't let people make that kind of request. It leads to too many problems, and is unrealistic with staffing as it is. (Examples being people only wanting to accept treatment from someone of their own race or background, requesting only male/female nurses for unscrupulous reasons, deliberately seeking out certain people to abuse them, etc.) \n\nWhere I work, we pretty much never say no to family participating in care, because we expect to discharge patients back home and want them to know how to care for their family member.

Some people deliberately choose a nurse of the opposite gender so that they can assault, harass, or accuse them of assault. Some people refuse nurses who aren't white because they are racist. Some people only want nurses who speak their specific language. That nurse also has their own patient load. We can't do it. It's not possible.

You\u2019re well within your rights to refuse services. However, while most things are about charges in a hospital\u2026 bathing is kind of a sticky one. Infection control harps on it because hospital acquired infections skyrocket without bathing. When a patient gets a secondary infection during their stay, the hospital doesn\u2019t get reimbursed for care. So bathing does go back to money, but maybe not in the way you may think. Also, even with the best intentions, sometimes family members mess up interventions/treatments without realizing it. Also, I don\u2019t think you were questioning anyone\u2019s ability to bathe your son. I think that was a weird way to take it.

In my state, I was so unbelievably embarrassed and uncomfortable the whole time because I kept thinking, \u201cWhy are you doing this? I\u2019m supposed to be the one to do this.\u201d I try to keep that experience in mind any time I\u2019m doing a bath/shower for a patient because I completely empathize with those who don\u2019t want me to do it (and sometimes they will refuse, you just gotta move on and suck it up. Wearing a mask around a rank patient helps enough too).\n\nEdit: I should mention the hospital I work for is a private one, so maybe it has different rules. But even so, I find your situation to be incredibly frustrating.", "NTA. Some nurses can be\u2026.prickly like that.", "NTA. You did the right thing for advocating for your sons needs. Just because he is in a medical setting doesn\u2019t mean his consent to who sees and touches his body doesn\u2019t matter.", "NTA. And honestly I\u2019m very uncomfortable that they were not immediately willing to find your son a nurse he was comfortable with. You\u2019re right. This is 2023. Where all genders and their comfort matter. If he feels more comfortable being washed by a man, then find a male nurse. If I were you, I would report this incident within the hospital. Small children should be made comfortable and their wishes should be respected.", "So it\u2019s okay if a 9 yr old girl isn\u2019t comfortable with a male nurse washing her but you\u2019re making things difficult because a 9 yr old boy isn\u2019t comfortable with a female nurse washing him?? I normally say figure it out with them first before reporting it, but sounds like even the supervisor was hard to deal with, and this kind of thing should be reported to the hospitals HR.", "This is appalling. As an ex-nurse, I would never ever have kicked a fuss about this. If it was an urgent medical situation, sure maybe I would have insisted that I do what was necessary despite the patient's discomfort, but for a simple sponge bath your son's autonomy and comfort should absolutely be respected. NTA in any way, and they should be ashamed to be treating a patient this way", "NTA, and you made the best point, if it was a girl not wanting to be bathed by a male nurse ! Good on you for standing your ground and pointing out the hypocricy of her attitude.", "I\u2019m a former bedside RN and now NP. The only thing I would have said if a parent offered to bath any of my patients no matter the age would be thank you. This hospitals policy is weird and in all the hospitals I have been in over the years I have never heard of such a thing.", "I am a nurse in a hospital. You have every right and that nurse needs to shit the hell up. What a bizarre thing for her to insist on doing. Just find another nurse. Also, there is ZERO reason you couldn't have done it yourself.", "Just as a side point, \"I *could* care less\" actually means you cared a lot, therefore (because your level of caring was so high on the scale) there is plenty of room for your level of caring to go down (become less).  As an example, if your level of concern starts at an 8 on a scale of one to ten (ten being high), you could care less- you could care at a 6, or a 3, or even hardly at all at a 1.\n\n\"I *couldn't* care less, on the other hand, means your level of caring is so low there is no room for it to go any lower. You couldn't possibly care less if your level of concern on a one to ten scale is already at a 0- there are no lesser (lower) numbers on the scale. \n\nNot to single you out, I just see this little mix up fairly frequently. The teacher in me just can't help but jump in to clarify.  Hopefully that explanation made sense.", "The hospital in my town charges a fee to clip a newborn's nails.", "insurance bullshit aside, clipping a newborn's nails is HARD", ">Some people only want nurses who speak their specific language.\n\nMedical lingo and jargon is so specific and so specialized that the International Baccalaureate program has a fully separate Spanish-language medical diploma, because neither the Spanish-language diploma or English medical diploma can fold it in. This is medical necessity in a significant number of cases.", "\u201cSome people only want nurses who speak their specific language\u201d\n\nThis is not like the others and it\u2019s terrible you\u2019ve lumped it in with people being sexist and racist. Wanting to be able to communicate in the language you\u2019re comfortable with with the people providing your medical care is *nothing* like demanding a nurse of a certain gender in order to assault them.", "NTA at all! If your child had been female would they still have argued that a male nurse should bathe her?!?!?!? You were standing up for your son. I hope your son has a speedy recovery.", "Nta requesting same sex nurse for care is common practice it has absolutely nothing to do with the nurses ability it has to do with patient comfort is repeat this supervisor especially because she thinks it\u2019s fine to ignore patients comfort she could do some trauma to a male or female victim", "NTA. That is very odd for them to be so resistant of you, your requests and your son\u2019s comfort. Regardless if you\u2019re not staff, you are the parent, giving your son a bath isn\u2019t a medical procedure and if they\u2019re worried of the wound, they could let you wash and walk you thru how to care for it ( as they should anyway for discharge planning/setting you guys up for when you have to do it after discharge - that was a missed opportunity on her end). \n\nIf this is a pediatric specific hospital\u2026 that\u2019s disappointing. If it\u2019s a general hospital\u2026 they need more pediatric training on how to navigate these simple ass requests and their thought process is not in line with how you care for pediatric families. \n\nGood on you for advocating. When you discharge, you may get a Press Ganey surgery or a hospital survey, I suggest letting them know of this incident. \n\nYou\u2019re right on if your kid was a girl getting forced a bath from a male nurse perspective. \nThe nurse was not right in this situation. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the pressure and ordeal", "Also know patients rights everyone. You have a right to refuse", "NTA I am a caregiver and it absolutely should be up to the patient no matter age who cares for them! Comfort is the most important thing when it comes to something so personal.", "NTA", "YTA. Unless you have an actual reason to doubt their ability, let the medical professionals do their job.\n\nIf they were an ambulance or emergency room worker providing critical emergency care that required removing your sons clothes, your concern about their gender would, I suspect, be temporarily suspended.", "NTA \u00d7 1000", "nta", ">I\u2019m sure nurses are very busy\n\nLetting the parents do it is less work for the nurses. Really weird.", "Most of the nurses I've encountered throughout my life have been absolute angels on earth. When my mom was in the hospital a few years ago, though, I had to deal with a head nurse who was on some sort of bizarre power trip. I don't know if it was homophobia (my partner was there with me) or if she was pissed off for some other reason, but she was an absolute ass to us, and while I'm usually very reserved and non-confrontational, after dealing with all the stress and anxiety of my mom's cancer surgery, I came UNGLUED on this woman. It sounds like this nurse has a similar issue.\n\nNTA.", "Two things. One, the one who is uncomfortable is the patient aka OP\u2019s son. Second, the cleaning is not an emergency. So you are saying that a woman has no rights to request for a female nurse when she needs any help with cleaning?", "Please share how you went off gaycatdaddy \ud83c\udf75 also i hope your mom is better", "Exactly this. Often parents are so bewildered of their child being hospitalized, they listen to everything the medical team says (even though sometimes it\u2019s wrong).", "Especially since his wound is on his hand! I would understand if it was on his face or midriff or something. But a hand is so easy to keep out of reach of a washingcloth.", "I have never ever been in a situation where something intimate had to happen in a hospital where I was NOT asked if I would prefer a same-gender person for my comfort. \n\nIt's bizarre that they were so uncooperative and weird about this.", "NTA.\n\nA patient deserves to be the most comfortable possible. A child asking to get washed by his own parents is a very reasonable and doable request, and nothing to be offended about.", "You weren't questioning the nurse's ability.  It had nothing to do with her.  Your son is a pre-teen who is probably just starting to understand about modesty and the relationship between his body and things happening between different sexes.\n\nNobody said the female nurse wasn't able to do it.  You just said your son was more comfortable with a very personal and private service being done by someone of the same gender.", "Yeah. My workplace has good insurance and a coworker still ran a go fund me for medical costs after his daughter got bit by a cottonmouth.", "He's the boys father", "You\u2019re not charged for bed baths. That\u2019s part of the nursing care.", "NTA. Good job Dad. Nurses rarely get enough credit for what they do. That being said this nurse/supervisor were out of line, and very unaccommodating, which surprises me. I wouldn't expect anything less from a 9 yo boy, wanting a little modesty during a very scary time. There shouldn't have been any issue.", "She's lying to you. Tell her an unfortunately child outweighs her politics, and virtue signaling. NTA", "I'd be VERY surprised if that's true.", "OP wasn't questioning the nurse's ability though.  He know she was perfectly capable.  All he was saying was that his son, a pre-teen who is just starting to understand about modesty etc, was uncomfortable with having such a personal service done by someone of the opposite sex.  It was about his son, not the nurse.", "At this point, my mom is doing better than I am! She has absolutely been thriving after her treatments. \n\nSo regarding the nurse, she was claiming that my mom could only have one guest in her room at a time. I pointed out that absolutely NOTHING in her pre-surgery documents said anything about that, and none of her doctors had said that. (There were also multiple chairs in my mom's room, so if only one guest is allowed at a time, why are they there?) I also pointed out that my mom's doctors had visited her room several times, and none of them said anything about guests. She came back with a booklet that she claimed outlined all the rules, but literally nothing in it said anything about limiting guests. I demanded her name and let her know that I would be reporting her. She did give me her name and then stormed off in a huff. Such wonderful (/s) treatment for someone who's gone through a difficult hours-long surgery for cancer and their family.", "What. No. \"I could care less\" and \"I couldn't care less\" mean the same thing, that someone doesn't care. They are interchangeable."]}
