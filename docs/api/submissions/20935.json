Yes, he was ripe and needed to be washed. I asked of I could do it and they said no because I wasn't a staff.\n\nI said I understood but maybe they could find a male nurse.

I got annoyed and asked her if she'd be bothered by a 9yo girl not wanting a male nurse to give her a bed bath and she said absolutely because its 2023.\n\nIn the end they found a male nurse and he got him fresh and cleaned. My son was a bit uncomfortable in the beginning but it was fine after they built some rapport.\n\nAnd yes my son is going to be fine.

I\u2019m in the UK and have a child with medical needs who occasionally needs admissions but we are encouraged to provide whatever care we want to here. It seems incredibly short sighted & it\u2019s not a great lesson in consent when they are not able to respect your sons wishes around his personal care. His reasons are valid. I agree with you - would they think it was ok if genders were flipped, a young girl not wanting a male nurse?! \nThey are TA imo.", "NTA. \u201cIts 2023.\u201d ???? Like it\u2019s not a sexism thing, lady. How about \u201cIt\u2019s 2023, we\u2019re teaching children about consent and bodily autonomy.\u201d I can understand if it\u2019s an inconvenience cause I\u2019m sure nurses are very busy but the way they seemed to take it personally is weird.", "NTA. If your son was my patient, I would have absolutely let you give him a bed bath. I don\u2019t see what the issue was. Unless the patient was a fall risk and needed assistance to the shower, I would have handed you the bath in a bag, some towels, and what ever else you needed with instructions to hit the call bell if assistance was needed. I hope he heals quickly!!", " NTA. I could tell you some real horror stories about nurses after being by my daughters side in the trauma ward for a week. A most very basic command nurses learn prior to graduating as a nurse is to listen to their patients and advocate on their patient\u2019s behalf at their patient\u2019s request. Sounds like your son has a dangerously egotistical nurse. There are many good nurses, but it seems so many more are just people looking for a high paycheck for minimal years of schooling.", "NTA. I (f) would want a female nurse for anything like that so I totally get it would be similar if it were reversed. \n\nThe hospital should have been more sensitive to that. Hope he's okay, OP.", "Bless you for honoring your kid\u2019s dignity, luv. So awesome. The nurses were being really obtuse - clearly hoping you\u2019d back off and make their shift a little easier. NTA and good on you.", "NTA \n\nThey were being unhelpful because they resent anything that makes their job even a tiny bit harder no matter the reason. Rude ass.", "NTA.  You're the boy's mother, your son told you exactly what was bothering him and the remedy was simple.  A nine year old, boy or girl, is old enough to know the difference between same and opposite sex and be made uncomfortable by the opposite sex with regards to intimate care.  We're just talking about a bath - it's not like the boy was refusing care from a female nurse.", "NTA. I would never condone requesting a specific gender for a medical act but we are talking about bathing. I simply don\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t do it yourself (maybe so they can make you pay for this if you are in the US?). But I suppose the bathing included private parts so Incan totally understand your son not being comfortable with it.", "The bill is going to be horrible. Rattlesnake antivenom costs $10k to $12k a vial. Your insurance will cover most if not all of it. I have no idea why they wouldn't let you wash him.", "NTA- this wasn\u2019t a matter of gender ability. He was uncomfortable with the nurse and can request a new one at any time. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks and I was on magnesium so I was a fall risk, and I absolutely went down when I got up before and the nurse caught me, I was trying to get to the bathroom and I\u2019ve been able to get up before, but this was my 2nd or 3rd bag, I was on it 3 days with no food. Pregnant with preeclampsia. And my boyfriend was able to help me and bathe me after C-section and while on magnesium. I was embarrassed even with him but I much rather had him than any nurse. Make or female. I\u2019m not sure why you couldn\u2019t bathe your own son my boyfriend who I am not married to can bathe me. I\u2019m located in NC, I am not sure your country.", "Info:\n\nWas the 'washing' and 'cleaning' anywhere around the wound site? Was this where they needed to wash? If so, then they may have had good reason to want a staff member to do it.\n\nIf not, I really don't understand why they wouldn't let you, the parent, wash him. Did they need to assess the perineal area? Was he catheterized? Did he have a femoral line? I can't understand why they wouldn't let the parent do this, otherwise. It literally makes the nurse's job easier.\n\nAs for the gender of the nurse impacting washing care, where I work we don't let people make that kind of request. It leads to too many problems, and is unrealistic with staffing as it is. (Examples being people only wanting to accept treatment from someone of their own race or background, requesting only male/female nurses for unscrupulous reasons, deliberately seeking out certain people to abuse them, etc.) \n\nWhere I work, we pretty much never say no to family participating in care, because we expect to discharge patients back home and want them to know how to care for their family member. Family participation in care is welcome, unless it's unsafe for medical reasons. \n\nFor context, I'm not American.", "NTA", "INFO: Why could the child not wash himself?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

First - it is very unusual that they won't let a family help. Usually nurses welcome all the help they can get. Is there any reason that the nurse might think you can't safely help him wash ?\n\nBut regardless - you were absolutely within your rights to request a male help with a very private matter with your young son.

Does not answer the question as to why, specifically, the child is unable to wash himself, the answer to which may give us clues as to why a nurse was required to wash the child, rather than his parent.\n\nFor instance, he would have a wound to one limb. He presumably has another hand; what's wrong with that one? Does he, perhaps, have IV lines that could be displaced if moved around in bed by someone unfamiliar with such interventions? Etc.", "Seriously. Here\u2019s the thing. Depending on what the facility is like, they might have 5-6 patients per nurse with varying acuity levels. If that male nurse has high acuity patients, he might not be able to spare the 30 minutes or so to bathe a patient that\u2019s not his. Or, there might not be a male CNA available. I can\u2019t understand what that nurse\u2019s issue is, but she needed to just let dad take over for a minute. It\u2019s a bath. There was no need to make a big deal like she did.", "Honestly, asking for a specific gender is not something we can accommodate where I work. Same thing as asking for a specific race or ethnic background. We don't do it. We can't do it, even if we wanted to. The person you are asking us to find also has patients who they are not able to abandon. Maybe they don't work that day. Maybe they're on a different floor, or don't have the qualifications for this particular patient.\n\nPeople ask for a specific gender for all kinds of (often awful) reasons. Some people refuse male nurses because they are homophobic and assume all male nurses are gay. Some people refuse female nurses as they are misogynistic and think all women are dumb and incompetent. Some people deliberately choose a nurse of the opposite gender so that they can assault, harass, or accuse them of assault. Some people refuse nurses who aren't white because they are racist. Some people only want nurses who speak their specific language. That nurse also has their own patient load. We can't do it. It's not possible. We don't have the staff to accommodate every request, and we can't plan staffing around whatever random person off the street gets admitted tonight, because we don't know who that is.\n\nWe don't accommodate these kinds of requests because it places an undue burden on hospital staff and we simply can't do it. It's not physically possible. We don't have extra staff lying around in wait for just the right person to request them. \n\ntl;dr:   I wish we had the staff that this was something we could realistically do, but that's not the world we live in.", "Good question.
