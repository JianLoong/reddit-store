{"id": 1373, "submission_id": "ymc5yr", "title": "AITA for screaming at my best friend", "selftext": "I am keeping my name the same but my friend is going to have a fake name for privacy reasons.\n\nMe (14M) and my friend Micheal (15M) have been friends for 1 1/2 years. But lately I have been realising he may not be a good friend. I started thinking this when I was ranting to my sister about him and realised how many things I hate about him. I\u2019m not saying he has to be perfect, no one is perfect but Micheal is especially nasty.\n\nHere\u2019s just some things to show you:\n\n.Micheal thinks he\u2019s the best. He thinks he is always the smartest, best looking and overall most well liked person in any room he is in. It\u2019s even small things like who has the longest ruler or who\u2019s uniform is tidiest, stuff like that.\n\n.Micheal is constantly rude and insulting to his family. He is constant beating up his little brother to the point of tears and then just leaving the room. He is verbally rude to his mum who spoils him rotten, she is always abiding to his every command which has lead him to calling her and screaming whenever he wants something\n\n.Micheal cannot keep secrets. I told him a secret that I did not want my mum to know, and then the next time he saw her he immediately told her. This specific secret was about something I had done that she did not want me to which led to me getting yelled at. A boy once told Micheal he had a crush on a girl and then Micheal immediately told her about it.\n\n\nThere are many more things but I don\u2019t want to make this too long. \n\nI have only noticed these things a month ago, I know that sounds weird but really you don\u2019t pick up on thing like that until your ranting.\n\nThat brings to yesterday, I had taken these things for over a year and I was just about ready to snap. We were sitting in the cantina of our school\n\nJust as Micheal mentioned that everyone hates me but he is liked by everyone I couldn\u2019t take it any more and shouted at him that he is an egotistical, rude and annoying asshole. He just said that he doesn\u2019t care because he is the only person that likes me so I\u2019ll come back.\n\nI screamed at him more until I stormed out, almost everyone else heard my rage.\n\nNow Micheal is pretending nothing happened which is making me more angry.\n\nBut now I\u2019m thinking I should have told him on his own instead of screaming in front of everyone. So tell me, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667600252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymc5yr/aita_for_screaming_at_my_best_friend/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are feeding into what he wants from you. Rise above it.  \n\nHe\u2019s the main AH for his shitty personality and how he treats people. What does he bring to your friendship? My advice is that if you don\u2019t share the same values or respect for one another then you cannot be friends. If he\u2019s not taking accountability for his actions, I\u2019d not waste my time on him."]}
