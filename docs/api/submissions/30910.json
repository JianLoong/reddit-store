She hosts every year, and every year her dogs have been a point of contention. \n\nShe has a 160lb Saint Bernard who is about 6, and overall pretty mellow, but huge. She has a new puppy this year who is about 7 months and 180lbs already. She refuses to lock them either outside or in their crates when we come over for Thanksgiving (and in general too, honestly). \n\nWe asked her to reconsider this year as we have a 6 year old who is afraid of the puppy who is huge and WILD. She jumps and is very intense. Sweet, but doesn\u2019t know her own strength. I\u2019m also 12 weeks pregnant, and my 100 year old grandma will be joining dinner too. \nMy husband asked his mom to lock the dogs up and her response was essentially \u201cno they\u2019re family\u201d.\n\n For some context, she is extra vulnerable this year as her youngest son passed unexpectedly 2 months ago. And I know the dogs have been a huge comfort when she\u2019s been home alone, as she is not married. \n\nAll of the horribleness of this year aside, it feels like an inappropriate time to let the dogs roam. They are constantly jumping, getting in people\u2019s faces, and lifting themselves up to eat things off the counter. There is little to no training for either dog. \n\nWe\u2019re considering not going because of it - I can\u2019t let dogs jump on me and potentially knock me over while I\u2019m pregnant, and our son is nervous about the dogs - but she is struggling this holiday season with such a profound loss.

This isn't an, \"eww, hair!\" or \"gross, drool!\" scenario. A powerful dog can knock over a grown adult. Neither you, your child, nor your 100 y/o grandmother should have to tolerate the fear of being bowled over by a boisterous puppy. It simply isn't safe.

Indicate that she's absolutely welcome to join you -- but OBVIOUSLY she can't bring the dogs.", "NTA  Ask her to spend the night and help you prepare the meal but the meal will have to be done at your house. This might make her feel more needed at this time. Explain that between Grandma, yourself and her grandson that you can't risk having you all around the dogs.", "NTA.  Keep your scared child away from untrained dogs.  Your MIL is a bad pet owner and that shouldn't be rewarded.", "Can your husband go by himself and you have Thanksgiving with the rest of your family?

It\u2019s very sad that she\u2019s experienced such a tragic loss, but the physical safety of the elderly, the young, and the medically vulnerable take precedence over her preferences. If she\u2019s not willing to put humans first over her untrained animals, then it sounds like some distance is necessary. What is she going to do when her new grandchild is born? Allow them to do whatever they want to the baby? This is a very legitimate issue, and I think it\u2019s time you and your husband put your feet down.", "NTA, but... is your MIL willing to compromise at all? Could the dogs be restricted from certain areas like the kitchen/dining room? Not left outside or shut in a room, but just barred from certain spaces with gates or furniture. \n\nFor example, I have a dog who is not good with small children. To host my family for Thanksgiving, I'm putting up baby gates to keep my dogs out of the living areas and dining room. They will have access to their dog door, to food and water, and space to play inside. But they won't be able to interact with my niblings, keeping everyone from being stressed out. \n\nI can understand your MIL's reluctance - the dogs are family, especially since her youngest child has passed and they are her daily companions. However, if she is unwilling to train them to the point that they could hurt someone, then she needs to understand that she either compromise, or accept that you won't be able to attend.", "I'm gonna go with YTA you are the guest not the dogs and she lost a child for gods sake...", "NTA. It's okay to stay home under the circumstances. I'm sorry your MIL isn't more compassionate about your son's fear of the dog.", "NTA\nHave dinner at your house even if you have to cater most of it in. Invite the grandma and your MIL. Your MIL can choose between family and dogs for the day.", "NTA\n\nAt the very least, dogs should not growl, bite, and jump on people when around trusted family and friends. If the dogs can\u2019t sit still for everyone to enjoy themselves and she is unwilling to keep them in another room, then it\u2019s reasonable that you don\u2019t want to go this year. Maybe she\u2019ll stop by your place for a quick lunch before hosting everyone else. Your requests to not be practically knocked over by her dogs is fair. \n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I asked these questions to make sure I understood the situation. You are going to your MIL\u2019s house with your dog, and you want her to crate or set up outside her dogs so your dog isn\u2019t scared? Will your dog also be crated or placed outside? Or do you expect your dog to have free roam of her house but put her dogs away?", "NTA. Your concerns are all valid. But your 100- year-old grandma is the greatest concern. Breaking a hip at that age usually means death soon after.", "NTA. Big, untrained dogs are a safety issue for children. If your mother wants to let the dogs roam, then they need to be trained.", "I feel like anyone who doesn\u2019t own or like dogs describes regular doggy behaviors as untrained, altho we don\u2019t eat off the counter at my house. We all can\u2019t see the actual situation so idk. You wouldn\u2019t be the AH for not going, and she\u2019s not the AH for letting her dogs be free in their home.", "NTA:\n\nI have three large dogs (160, 100, 90) all under three years old. They get super excited when people come over and forget how to act right. We put the dogs outside for short visits or lock them in the \u201cdog room\u201d for longer stays. We are hosting thanksgiving and will be taking them (and their kennels) to a family members house (who also have large dogs) while people are over. \n\nOur dogs are our children and they are treated as such\u202699% of the time. They will have their thanksgiving dinner when they get home and will survive the few hours they aren\u2019t at home. MIL needs to put them up while company is over or ask someone else to host.", "NTA! \n\nMy dog is nowhere near that size but is super exuberant- when our family come to stay for the holidays she spends more time behind a baby gate than she usually would (although the kids \u2018sneak\u2019 her extra treats through the bars \ud83d\ude02), and gets longer walks and garden time with us to compensate. This is when it is for multiple days. \n\nI think your husband needs to take the lead on this one \u201cMom, you know we love you and would like to spend thanksgiving with you. However, the dogs are too unruly to be included and I refuse to have my son more scared, and OP potentially hurt, not to mention OP\u2019s grandmother given her age and fragility. If you are not willing to ensure the dogs are away for the entire duration we are there then I am am afraid that we will not be in attendance at your home this year. You will of course be welcome at ours, the dogs are not.\u201d", "NTA. I think for safety that you should decline going to her house this year.\n\nFrom your comments, you're far too worried about hurting her feelings, & not worried enough about the physical & mental safety of your grandma or child. \n\nI know it's hard, bc she'll be upset you're not coming. However, you absolutely need to set your priorities, & Someone Getting Physically Hurt supersedes Someone Feeling Slighted.", "NTA - but you need to move the event to a place where all can be comfortable without upsetting the dogs.", "NAH. She can let her dogs do whatever she wants at her event in her house. You can not attend because her dogs are a genuine safety risk to your family. She is grieving and deserves family support - but not at the expense of that family's own wellbeing because she won't provide a secure and comfortable space for her family to visit.", "NTA. I couldn't eat there. Gross (and dangerous).", "NTA - Host your 100 year old grandma at your place. That sounds much safer.\n\nand I love dogs, I have 3 of them, but an untrained puppy and a 100yo is only going to end in an ambulance ride and a hospital visit.", "NTA. Very similar to what has happened with my mother, who essentially went insane with the big dogs. My son is skittish also. I got bitten by one of them and that was all I was willing to tolerate (\"It's just a puppy. It's still learning\").\n\nFuck that.\n\nHumans are humans. Dogs are dogs. And... don't refer to me as its' brother!", "NTA.. The 6 year old st.Bernard is only a tripping hazzard at best but the puppy. You have 3 vulnerable people in your family. Grandma, yourself and child. There are good chances someone will get hurt.", "NTA\n\nSo first off...there's pretty much zero chance that a 7 month old puppy weights 180 pounds, I don't care what breed it is, that's like 100 pounds over what even a giant dog would be at that age. Unless your MIL is raising clifford the big red dog, pretty sure that's an exaggeration or you've got the age of the dog wrong. But they CAN be pushing 90-100 pounds at that age which is still hefty.\n\nBut regardless that doesn't change anything. Dog owners have a responsibility to create an enviornment that is safe and appropriate for everyone in it. And if she can't train her giant ass puppy not to jump on people, she needs to not expose that puppy to an uncontrolled situation where they could cause harm to someone until she's able to train the dog. This is what a crate is for.\n\nAnd that's before you even bring in the fact that you're pregnant and your child is afraid of the dog.\n\nResponsibile dog owners know how to handle their dogs around people. Period.", "NTA. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but we can\u2019t put grandma at risk like that. I\u2019m also concerned about my pregnancy and my son would be scared. We won\u2019t be able to make it. We\u2019re happy to host you at our place if you change your mind\u201d. End of discussion.", "NTA, 180lb dog + 160lb dog + 6 year old child. Not a risk I would take.", "NTA keeping the dogs in another room is not too big an ask, and if it's a deal breaker for her then ultimately it's her that's made the choice not you", "NTA, but unfortunately,  you can't dictate what her dogs do in their own home. What you *can* do is have your own Thanksgiving at home, and when she gets upset, just repeat that you and your son do not currently feel safe around the dogs.", "You can't expect someone to lock their pets up, pets are family. So I'd say skip it if it's that big of a problem for you.", "NTA - and you tell her that either the dogs go into crates or go outside for the day or we won\u2019t be there. It\u2019s time to be blunt and force the issue.\n\nIf she had actually trained these huge and disruptive dogs, this would be a different story.", "NTA.\n\nI own a 50lb psycho labradoodle (who I love to death), but she just has so much love to give and her body is too small to contain it. At least, that's how I describe it. Every guest is a new exciting friend and she just freaks out. Kids are even MORE exciting. Yes, I have worked extensively on training with her...she knows the commands but just can't contain herself sometimes. She doesn't jump on anyone - actually managed to train that out of her - but she is still an utter nuisance for the first 10-15 mins when guests arrive. \n\nUnless people are truly dog people and love the crazy and loving attention, I always crate her until the guests get settled and it calms everything down. \n\nIf ANYONE is uncomfortable with her around, she is crated immediately. At the end of the day, she is a 50lb animal. Yeah I love her but the safety and comfort of my guests comes first.", "Nta.

The dog's chest will hit your knee (without hurting the dog) and they will learn if they jump on you, it's uncomfortable for them.", "?? We have visited and called her daily during all this loss, we just don\u2019t live with her. Jesus Christ.", "We did ask her if she\u2019d like us to host, as a way of helping relieve any pressure of having to think about the logistics while she\u2019s dealing with so much stress. She really wants to host, but I may revisit the suggestion.", "My husband and I have two large dogs. My MIL has two medium size dogs. When people come over for something like this they are kenneled/moved to a different room, etc. I think the best case scenario would be for OP to host. I imagine your mother doesn\u2019t kennel the dogs often and they probably won\u2019t be comfortable doing something new. Allowing large animals to jump on guests is not acceptable.", "The first time I read this it looked like \"I have a few big breasts in my house\" and was very confused - are they attached to people? Disembodied? Mounted on plinths? I had so many questions in the split second before I re-read the sentence.", "Agree with this but I don't think OP should say grandma is uncomfortable going because there was no indication of that. She just said her grandmother's age, no mention of a conversation or anything expressed by her.", "Thank you for this. I will definitely send her the info", "This is a real concern of mine as well. She has another grandchild from her other son who she left alone with her older dog as a baby. The dog ripped into the pack n play. Baby was fine, but she is pretty convinced her dogs cannot hurt others because they aren\u2019t mean.", "So, we did originally offer to host to help take the pressure off of her, but she declined and said she really wants to host. But maybe I should offer again.", "No, my dogs are staying home in their crates. She has 2 Saint Bernards of her own that she wants to have roam free, but they are very excitable and jumpy. With them both being near 200lbs it makes me nervous for my safety, my kid\u2019s safety and my grandma\u2019s safety.", "Yes. This. My grandpa passed at 107 from complications of a broken hip and surgery that went wrong. A broken hip at any age is difficult to recover from but it can certainly be a death sentence for the elderly.", "It\u2019s a safety concern for the grandma too, if she gets knocked over by a dog at her age it could easily be game over. 3 of my grandparents were hospitalised after falls and never came home.", "Dog owner here. Based on OP's description, both dogs do sound untrained. It doesn't sound like she dislikes the dogs. She's just pointing out that they have behavior that needs to be addressed by MIL.", "And anyone who has poorly trained dogs tries to excuse it by saying it\u2019s regular dog behavior. Jumping on everyone who comes into your home is not regular dog behavior. It\u2019s fully possible to train dogs not to do that, and irresponsible not to. It hurts and if your dog is the size of a Saint Bernard it\u2019s genuinely unsafe. OP is NTA and MIL is.", "I will say, I own 2 dogs and LOVE dogs. One dog I have is a very energetic husky. But the behaviors are that her dogs display are often that are untrained dogs. She even admits to not putting training into the puppy because she often lays around when no one is visiting. But I totally know what you mean.", "This can be true,  but I dont get the feeling OP dislikes dogs. OP is pregnant with a six year old. The dogs are most likely much bigger than the six year old, and falls can be incredibly dangerous to the mother and fetus.", "Jumping on people and taking food that isn't theirs *is* a lack of training.", "I would agree with you if she weren't insisting on hosting.  I think it's the responsibility of the host to ensure their guests feel and are safe in their home. If the dogs are a danger to visitors, especially small children, then she shouldn't be inviting people over if she's unwilling to take precautions to keep her guests safe.\n\nOP says they offered to host so mom could be with family without the stress of hosting and without worrying about the dogs.", "I once attended a party where the hosts didn't scold their dog for eating food off the counter, that was on a platter, put out for everyone to share. My partner mentioned that the dog did that and their response? \"Yeah [the dog] will do that.\" We have not gone to their house again. If someone wants to let their dog share a plate with them they can do that but we absolutely are not willing to.", "180 pound untrained puppy!!! Like for real?", "Totally possible I have the age wrong, but she is under a year. My MIL has reiterated the dogs weight a lot lately because she loves how huge she is.", "I have a 15lb dog and still wouldn't risk her being around a six year old at a dinner party. My dogs are my babies but I still pop them away when I have people over for dinner just to make it easier.", "My dogs are family, but they get sent to dog jail (the back bedroom) if they're being assholes. My responsibility to my dogs includes ensuring that they mind their manners.", "It is a big problem. A 6 year old is nothing next to a 180lb dog that's wild and not properly trained. If the dog decides to jump on to OP or grandma, there could be broken bones or even the loss of life.\n\nNormally, I would say that dogs should be able to roam free in their own home. But I would also assume those dogs are properly trained, no matter their size.", "Imagine being so selfish that you know your own young grandchild is afraid of your dog but being unwilling to compromise and mitigate the situation. Yikes. Grief is certainly a mitigating factor on her part, but I really can\u2019t imagine just\u2026not caring about my poor grandkid\u2019s feelings and fears when they\u2019re right in front of me.", "it\u2019s absolutely reasonable to expect someone to lock up their pets if the pet is a danger to someone you invited to your house. My 8 pound cat is a skittish, fear aggressive weirdo and I lock her up when I invite my toddler nephew and his parents over. bc i invited the people over so why wouldn\u2019t i do what i needed to to make my home safe for them?? they have never asked me to do it, i just want my nephew to be safe so I make the cat comfy in my bedroom for a few hours. This seems like normal caring behavior towards your human family, idk why people wouldn\u2019t do that?", "You definitely can and it\u2019s the reasonable thing to do. She cares more about about the dog than her grandson feeling safe at her house.", "But without the dogs.  Because you know she'll try!", "We did offer to host, and she insisted on hosting.", "There's a good chance OP's mom is the kind of person to bring her dogs with her everywhere.  I know two people who won't go to anyone's house or apartment unless their very large, energetic dogs are allowed in.", "Yeah, I have a Husky/Greyhound/GSD/Collie who is currently 90lbs and only 11 months old. He's knocked me down, covered me in scratches, headbutted me, smacked me in the face and almost suffocated me once. He's lovely and trained but he's still young and gets too excited occasionally, and he has no concept of his own size or strength.\n\nI don't host company unless they're dog people who can deal with his shenanigans.", "I would love to host as a way to help her out, and this was something she and I discussed, but she really wanted to. With the suggestions in this thread, it might be worth circling back to that offer again though.", "I'm not sure if this makes a difference or not, but our Thanksgiving events usually last about 2-3 hours total - probably closer to 2 while I'm pregnant since I haven't been feeling well", "Her older dog is chill now, but is also untrained and has jumped on us many times in the past. He didn\u2019t really calm down until the last year. We haven\u2019t allowed our son without us at her house because of that dog in the past, and now not because of the puppy. She gets very angry at us for not allowing that because she thinks it\u2019s an overreaction.", "What are the 7 basics?", "If we weren\u2019t on the internet I would give your comment a standing ovation. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "And you have to start when they're baby puppies and not wait until they're 100+lbs. My daughter has two big dogs and neither of them jump up on people because they've been trained not to.", "If you\u2019re serious about not going, consider setting a kind boundary instead of making another suggestion. \n\n\u201cMom, I understand you won\u2019t lock up the dogs. I understand you\u2019ve been going through a lot lately and they\u2019re an important comfort for you. But for the safety of me, my kids, and grandma, we will not be coming over to your house for Thanksgiving. I still want to celebrate with you and you\u2019re more than welcome to have Thanksgiving with us at our house.\u201d \n\nNTA your mom is for not training her dogs and this is a compromise she can make.", "Don\u2019t offer. Inform her and invite her.", "I agree that your husband needs to have a chat with her. He needs to tell her that it is very important to him for everyone to spend time together, especially this year with the loss of his brother, but he is very concerned about an accident with the dogs jumping on either you or your grandmother.  He\u2019s not willing to risk you and your baby\u2019s health by getting knocked down by a well-meaning, but surprising jump attack by a 180lb puppy. \n\nBecause of that, the two of you will be hosting and want her there with you.  If it\u2019s important to get to feel like she is contributing, give her tasks at a level that makes you comfortable.  Baking, sides, prep, whatever. It may become a new tradition to be enjoyed now that she will have a new grandchild.", "Talk to your husband, but it has to be more than an offer. \"We are hosting Thanksgiving and would love it if you joined us. We cannot do T-Day at your house.\"", "You should have your husband do this conversation with her. And it needs to be more than an offer:\n\nMother dearest:\n\nThis is what will happen. You now have two options. \n\nEither the dogs are locked away for the duration of the get-together at your house.\n\nOr we don't come. We will also strongly urge Grandma not to come. We will host at our house and you are welcome to come, but the dogs are not.\n\nWhich option do you choose?", "Thank you for your answer! I updated my judgement. There should be a base level to dog behavior that is universal even in their own home.", "Thank you for your answer! I updated my judgement. There should be a base level to dog behavior that is universal even in their own home.", "I am soooo sorry!\n\nAgreed it's too big of a risk! I was shocked by statistics on a doctor's office door of how many old people don't survive hip fractures.", "I commented solely bc I just hosted in-laws for almost 10 days and my dogs could literally squeak a toy and I would hear a complaint or gripe. Haven\u2019t we ever heard three sides to every story? As I\u2019m sure incessant tot squeaking is annoying to some lol.", "The worlds largest puppy was 180 pounds at 9 months old. Maybe buy her a scale ;)", "Yep, I lost 3 of my grandparents due to complications after a fall. A fall at the grandma\u2019s age could be fatal.", "So this is my train of thought generally as well. We have a 50 lb husky who IS trained, but still very excitable. She gets crated whenever we have company unless the company specifically asks to have her out. but I am trying to be extra sensitive to my MIL during her time of intense grief.", "Yeah, this MIL needs \"no dogs\" spelled out very clearly.", "Well then the answer is thanks but we are staying home this year. Changing to NTA", "This actually was an issue with her a few years ago. We were in a tiny apartment that didn\u2019t allow dogs and she brought her dog to Christmas anyway. We politely asked her to bring him home and she didn\u2019t come back because she was so angry with us.", "Pffffffft.  She should get them a couple new toys and shut them in her bedroom or something.", "Unfortunately, no matter what the overall judgement winds up here, she'll either be even more mad you \"abandoned her\" after her son died (and I'd almost guarantee that's how it'll be presented, or you'll have to deal with the dogs.\n\nShe's made it clear they're not getting crated. Either way, one of you is going to be unhappy.", "Sit, stay, down, come, no, heel, and off", "This is perfect. You CANNOT do thanksgiving at her house!", "This exactly. I wouldn\u2019t be offering, I\u2019d be telling. We just can\u2019t come if the dogs aren\u2019t crated, and neither can grandma. Therefore, we\u2019ll be hosting, and you\u2019re welcome to come.", "I had the impression that \"grandma\" is OP's grandma so I don't imagine she'll come without OP.", "It\u2019s often not even really the injury itself that does it, its the other complications. My nanna fell and broke her hip, she was struggling to sleep in hospital so they gave her a sleeping pill and that was enough to finish her off! She was frail, so if it hadn\u2019t been that it would\u2019ve been something else, so we didn\u2019t blame them at all. She was 79. My grandad fell and broke his hip, he needed drugs to clot the blood in his hip so it could heal, but already had a blood clot in his lung that needed medication to thin the blood. Catch 22. Nothing they could do. He was 80. My grandma fell and broke her foot and ankle, the surgery was successful and it was healing nicely, but she got an infection and was dead a few days later. She\u2019d been in hospital for weeks. She was 89, almost 90.\n\nSo yeah, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be letting a big excitable puppy near a 100-year-old loved one!", "I have a husky and a dachshund. Squeaking toys and barking don\u2019t both us at all. It\u2019s the jumping.", "Haha that\u2019s fair", "the extenuating circumstance of grief does warrant extra sensitivity. it\u2019s a tough situation to be sure", "Totally agree that either way sucks. I just feel such a strong sense of protection for my kiddo and pregnant body. But I really do feel terrible about either option.", "Late 60s here. Thanks for confirming one my major concerns about aging. It's. hard to remember you're not as limber as in your mind, and so you do things you shouldn't and yes, my knee hurts from a slight fall yesterday ;-)", "Oh no, I hope your knee is ok! But yeah, aging is shite! \ud83d\ude2d", "Thanks! It's healing nicely, just got overstretched when I forgot the stool was on the \"other\" side :-)"]}
