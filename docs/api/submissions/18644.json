The annoying ones are those who insist on it being super well done but refuse to let the cook butterfly it. It can take ages to cook a well-done steak and all you're doing is holding up the meal for everyone else. \n\nWhen I worked in a restaurant, we had a very rich, famous regular who only ever ordered filet mignon and he wanted it well done to the point of being burnt. We finally just gave up and started cooking his steak as soon as he showed up for the reservation (before he ordered) or he'd complain that it was taking too long. He also insisted on having ketchup instead of the fancy demi-glace, but that's a whole different story.", "Agreed. They can be a nightmare because its such a fine line. I worked at a restaurant where I had to cook at least 50 of them a night and I still messed up occasionally, but luckily we could almost always tell before we sent them out. We also only served them medium rare and refused to cook them any other way because we knew people would then complain. It's one thing to insist on a certain way in a fancy restaurant. It's completely different when you have people over for dinner and you ask for their preference but still cook it the way you want. \n\nMy point wasn't really about Wagyu though. I mainly wanted to point out that there were other posts where the OP also refused to cater to guests and insisted on serving medium rare or rare steak that some people wouldn't eat. Those OPs were also assholes just as the brother is in this situation. If you're a good host and you know some people won't eat the main course the way you prepared it, you either cook something different or try to accommodate them somehow.", "Yeah before the early 2000\u2019s people had an actual excuse.

If we went out and she got a steak, we would all watch her make that center cut.
