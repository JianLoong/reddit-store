Why would he ask how people like their steaks if he was going to ignore your requests and cook them how he likes regardless?

That's hysterical.", "NTA\n\nYou asked nicely multiple times after the first incident, there is no reason why he can\u2019t cook steak how you like it. Job stress is a cop out excuse and he\u2019s making family dinner a chore instead of fun", "NTA, and I would not have eaten any of the steaks.", "LOL!  I would've done the same.  What a way to RUIN a perfect piece of meat!  NTA.", "You went exactly the right distance. NTA", "NTA- but you could probably have a candid conversation with bro about how you just don\u2019t enjoy his overcooked steak nor the way he ignores your preference after asking. But personally, I\u2019d not go anymore and cite those two reasons in a plain/matter-of-fact way and just ignore the fallout. Some families are just stubborn to a fault.", "NTA he asks how you want it and does it the way he wants it. Why even ask if you aren't even going to attempt.", "Imma go with NTA and I do like my shoe vehicle for A1 sauce lol. \n\nThe myoglobin makes me a wee bit nauseous.", "NTA. Hosting someone for dinner means making them comfortable and cooking something they will enjoy, whether you like it or not.\n\nI like my steak medium rare. I\u2019ll cook mine to that level. If someone wants theirs well done, that\u2019s how I\u2019ll cook it for them because they are my guest.", "Hilarious NTA", "NTA and his weird flex has gotten really old. He's a truly shitty host.\n\nYour parents are at least partial AHs for supporting him (lemme guess, Golden Child?). How did they request their steaks?\n\nJust bring your own meal next time he hosts.", "I think I'm going to go with ESH here.\n\nFirst, he's an asshole - not for liking his steak overdone and awful (he can like it however he likes it), but for intentionally overdoing it repeatedly then having the nerve to keep asking you how you'd like it, when he's obviously just going to ignore you.\n\nUnfortunately, you're a bit of an AH too. I get your frustration, but you didn't get anything accomplished by going that far to make the insult. Justified, perhaps, but not productive.\n\nYour parents seem to suck as well, causing drama for you not attending and for taking sides here.", "ESH\n\nEveryone likes their steak different, and if he's going to ask how you like it, he should at least try to cook it how you ask for it.  The way you answered though was pretty snarky and over the top, seems like you took it a little too far and said it in a way that was a bit more polite.", "You were a bit rude and ungrateful for a free meal. Although, as a fellow steak lover, I  get your frustration. It was also a bit of an A H move on your brother to ask how you want your steak and then totally ignore the answers. I am going with ESH", "ESH he was doing a nice gesture by cooking for you. You should\u2019ve explained to him how to cook it rare since clearly he doesn\u2019t know.

You just *finally* gave him a message he would hear.  Your polite attempts fell on deaf ears. So, there it is. \n\nI fault your brother for him not accepting constructive (and kind) criticism.  Personally, I will not eat shoe leather.  My husband likes his steak more well done than I and will occasionally produce shoe leather.  I finally started to eat everything else and after dinner, putting away the steak, and feeding it to the dog the next day.  I love my husband, despise shoe leather.", "Take a sandwich. You can announce beforehand or not, \"If my steak isn't at least close to rare, I brought a sandwich.\" If he puts a shoe leather in front of you, push it away and make glorious happy noises while you eat your sandwich.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAs a host it is brother's responsibility to cook to his guest's liking. We are opposite in the family, I do most of the cooking, like a nice med rare. Mom wants well done. So I oblige even if it isn't how I like my steak cooked personally. It really is not that hard to manage steaks cooked to different temps.", "NTA my two brothers also cook meat to death! And one of the two actually prefers steak/hamburger rare like I do, at least when ordering in a restaurant. But his wife likes hers well done, and so they both just end up cooking everything to death. I try to smile and be grateful and just enjoy family time lol.", "NTA, but it is VERY easy to make a steak well done (for those who life it like that) and it still being tender and juicy. It just takes longer, and has to be cooked further away from the flame, sprinkled with lots of salt and have melted butter brushed over it every minute or two.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I went to my cousin's place for a BBQ once, and her husband was grilling steaks. Like OP, I like my steaks rare, which he had never done before. (They both prefer medium)\n\nYou know what he did? Googled how to cook a rare steak so I could have mine how I like it. The brother's a total AH for not doing the same.\n\n(The steak was delicious, by the way.)", "Op mentions that maybe it could be a flexing thing due to his promotion, since good steaks can run pretty expensive. Do I wonder if he is actually buying low quality steaks and cooking them to hell and back to conceal the facade.\n\nOnce a steak is well done, a $500 cut and $5 cut become almost indistinguishable, so maybe brother is putting on airs by making family think he can afford expensive steaks when he actually can\u2019t.", "I wouldn't say Golden Child so much as very firmly in the \"Nothing is more important or special than quality family time because that was the best part of *my* life growing up, so don't you *dare* disrupt that.\" camp. Dad likes it less rare than me but still rare, Mom wants medium", "I agree with the ESH.  He seems to have some problems, but being a snarky ass doesn't help anyone.  Just makes you feel special for a minute.  \n\nMaybe her brother is literally a terrible cook.  She can at least try to tell him before going nuclear.", "I feel like the fifth time you ask everyone what they want and you just do your own thing anyway, you should be prepared for some snark, or even a \u201cwhat the hell!?\u201d.\n\nDon\u2019t ask for preferences if you\u2019re just going to impose your\u2019s anyway, either actually take them into account or just don\u2019t ask at all.", "I dunno, to keep asking how you like your steak only to ignore the answer is begging for this kind of response.", "I wouldn't say op is ungrateful for free meal, they take turns. Which means he also enjoys free meal when op cooks.  He gets something he likes when op is the host but expecting that op shouldn't complaint when he did that for 5 dinners straight is~~~", "It's not 'free', they rotate inviting each other so it balances every three weeks. OP even decided to not accept inedible food by just not going, but was pretty much forced to attend the next time. What else should she do? Dump half a bottle of tomato sauce over it?", "Kudos to that husband!  There are some good ones out there :-)", "Now, that's a good host. \ud83d\ude42", "My guess would be that the brother just doesn't know how the hell to cook a steak. I have a friend who likes to go big and do steaks for get together.Turns out he didn't know how to temp check shit.", "even a mediocre steak marinaded will be decent if not overcooked. I am inclined to believe he is  a control freak or one of those, my way or the highway type of people.", "I did. Did you not see where I stated that I offered to cook everyone else's?", "Yeah, but if you make some snarky comment at someone, you should also be prepared that they aren't going to like it and that you'll probably get some push-back.  \n\nAlso, the other thing we don't know is if the brother was doing it intentionally or just is bad at cooking steaks.", "Yeah, it's definitely lame, but maybe the response was a little much.  Sorta depends on the people and their sense of humor.", "Oh yeah, he's a great guy, and they're perfect for each other. The whole family just adores him.", "Like I said, Google's a thing. If you're not sure how to cook something properly, you look it up. You don't make your guests eat your poorly-cooked food.", "That\u2019s also a possibility. The fact that he got defensive when asked if blood made him squeamish could also point to the possibility that he just hates blood, which means that he made a pretty unfortunate choice to only serve steaks.", "I did.  Depending on how and when you offered, it could be kind of mean.  Was it privately?  People can taste what they are eating. They don't need you to announce it. \n\nAnnouncing to everyone he is a shit cook when he is trying to show off is a dick move and you know it.  Maybe he is a dick and deserves it. There might be more context, but there is a lot of different ways to go about it.  Offering help, privately.  Offering constructive instructions that aren't dickish. \"I know you like yours a little more well done, so about half the cook time for mine would be perfect. Thanks\"\n\nIt's your family, you are probably going to see them again.", "You always gotta be prepared for the pushback when you make snarky comments.\n\nThe thing is that I really don\u2019t see the point of continuing to ask if he doesn\u2019t actually care or have the ability to fulfill the requests. The first time is forgivable, but five times, you would be forgiven if you thought it was a matter of disrespect. If he can\u2019t or really doesn\u2019t want to, he should just tell everyone that they are getting well done steaks and they can take it or leave it."]}
