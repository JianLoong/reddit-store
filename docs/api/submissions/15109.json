It caused a bit of a problem in her marriage as my brother, \u201cTodd\u201d, didn\u2019t want to convert and the church (at least the one she attends) encourages you to cut out those who will not follow the teachings. I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened but Todd and Lucy have remained married. He hasn\u2019t joined the church, she attends and said they\u2019d raise their future children doing so. Our family has been supportive, once we got over the hurdle of her trying to convert us.\n\nIt has been a little tricky as Lucy doesn\u2019t celebrate holidays and will scoff invited. So, Todd will go by himself and she resents not being invited. We\u2019ve let it know, if she wants to come, then she\u2019s more than welcome, but we\u2019re not going to just not have celebrations.\n\nLucy has also told us since she joined the church to not get her gifts and she won\u2019t get us any. We were okay with that. \n\n\nLast year, Lucy and Todd welcomed their son, \u201cAndrew\u201d. His first birthday was on Saturday. I wasn\u2019t expecting a party but then Lucy said they were having an \u201cI love you\u201d party for him. It seemed like a cop out but my husband and I agreed to bring our daughter (2) to the party.\n\nAgain, Lucy has stated several times that she and Andrew cannot give or receive gifts on holidays and birthdays. She even said no birthday gifts. So, I didn\u2019t get him anything, though I helped my daughter make a card that just said \u201cWe love you, Andrew!\u201d\n\nThe party was mostly Lucy\u2019s church friends. She doesn\u2019t have a large extended family, myself and Todd\u2019s lives in a different state. When we arrived, the table was stacked with presents. We were the only ones who didn\u2019t get him something. I heard someone from the church calling it an \u201cI love you\u201d gift but didn\u2019t want to make a thing of it.\n\nMonday, Lucy called and the subject of the party came up. I was trying to understand the difference between a birthday and what the party was. She just kept saying it was different and they weren\u2019t technically celebrating his birthday. I said it was semantics really. It\u2019d be one thing if they celebrated it on a random day but it was on his birthday. She accused me of judging her religion and I said no, I just think that this is a cop out. It\u2019s totally fine to celebrate your child. I love my nephew and will do my best to be at every party. But that 100% was a birthday party. She can dress it up as she wants,  but that\u2019s what it is.\n\nLucy said I was a judgmental bitch and hung up. Todd is actually on my side but feels I shouldn\u2019t have said it. He wanted to and kept quiet to keep peace.

Do you want this child to never have another birthday party? If so that was the way to go about it. With extremely strict religions/cults like this you don't want to ride your high horse around the paddock. You want to give them the space to slowly but surely separate themselves from the doctrine. What you did forced her further into the us vs them rhetoric. What you want is for her to notice the world isn't what JWs say it is. Give her the space to be hypocritical. Give your nephew a chance to have future birthday parties. Being right is great, but not to the expense of everything and everyone else.", "Soft YTA. You are totally right. She is skating around the edges of lies so she can call herself by her religion though since most of her guests were from her church it quite possibly could be the way that specific church approaches such things so that the families can still have some of the normal things without it being a sin. IMO it almost feels like she compromised by throwing an I love You party in the stead of a Birthday Party so that she could still have a party for her LO. It also seems to me that the members of the church don\u2019t see it as that big of a deal because not only did they join the party they also brought gifts. They all know it\u2019s a birthday party but aren\u2019t allowed to call it a birthday party. As she is a fairly new member (a couple years vs raised in the church) she probably worries that she could be ostracized. People don\u2019t usually convert for no reason. I would say she probably truly wants to be a JW and believes in what they teach but also wants to try to be as normal as possible. I can imagine this causes her some stress as the changes can be quite drastic. If she is still trying to figure out the nuances of how to act within her church, keep decent relationships with a family who tries to support but doesn\u2019t understand, and figure out where the line is between the two she is likely unwilling to admit that she is wrong in this situation to someone outside of the church. Calling her out is not helpful to anyone. JW actively cut ties with people who don\u2019t convert and she is trying to not do that to her family\u2026. but calling her out on something this small is not a good way to approach it.", "YTA, to yourself. \n\nThe donkey told Tiger, \u201cThe grass is blue.\u201d\n\nTiger replied, \u201cNo, the grass is green.\u201d\n\nThe discussion became heated, and the two approached Lion. \n\nDonkey started screamed: \u201cYour Highness, isn\u2019t it true that the grass is blue?\u201d\n\nLion replied: \u201cIt is true that  you believe the grass is blue.\u201d\n\nDonkey rushed on, \u2032\u2032Tiger disagrees with me and annoys me.
