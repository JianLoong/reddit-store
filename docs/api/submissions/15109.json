It caused a bit of a problem in her marriage as my brother, \u201cTodd\u201d, didn\u2019t want to convert and the church (at least the one she attends) encourages you to cut out those who will not follow the teachings. I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened but Todd and Lucy have remained married. He hasn\u2019t joined the church, she attends and said they\u2019d raise their future children doing so. Our family has been supportive, once we got over the hurdle of her trying to convert us.\n\nIt has been a little tricky as Lucy doesn\u2019t celebrate holidays and will scoff invited. So, Todd will go by himself and she resents not being invited. We\u2019ve let it know, if she wants to come, then she\u2019s more than welcome, but we\u2019re not going to just not have celebrations.\n\nLucy has also told us since she joined the church to not get her gifts and she won\u2019t get us any. We were okay with that. \n\n\nLast year, Lucy and Todd welcomed their son, \u201cAndrew\u201d. His first birthday was on Saturday. I wasn\u2019t expecting a party but then Lucy said they were having an \u201cI love you\u201d party for him. It seemed like a cop out but my husband and I agreed to bring our daughter (2) to the party.\n\nAgain, Lucy has stated several times that she and Andrew cannot give or receive gifts on holidays and birthdays. She even said no birthday gifts. So, I didn\u2019t get him anything, though I helped my daughter make a card that just said \u201cWe love you, Andrew!\u201d\n\nThe party was mostly Lucy\u2019s church friends. She doesn\u2019t have a large extended family, myself and Todd\u2019s lives in a different state. When we arrived, the table was stacked with presents. We were the only ones who didn\u2019t get him something. I heard someone from the church calling it an \u201cI love you\u201d gift but didn\u2019t want to make a thing of it.\n\nMonday, Lucy called and the subject of the party came up. I was trying to understand the difference between a birthday and what the party was. She just kept saying it was different and they weren\u2019t technically celebrating his birthday. I said it was semantics really. It\u2019d be one thing if they celebrated it on a random day but it was on his birthday. She accused me of judging her religion and I said no, I just think that this is a cop out. It\u2019s totally fine to celebrate your child. I love my nephew and will do my best to be at every party. But that 100% was a birthday party. She can dress it up as she wants,  but that\u2019s what it is.\n\nLucy said I was a judgmental bitch and hung up. Todd is actually on my side but feels I shouldn\u2019t have said it. He wanted to and kept quiet to keep peace.

Do you want this child to never have another birthday party? If so that was the way to go about it. With extremely strict religions/cults like this you don't want to ride your high horse around the paddock. You want to give them the space to slowly but surely separate themselves from the doctrine. What you did forced her further into the us vs them rhetoric. What you want is for her to notice the world isn't what JWs say it is. Give her the space to be hypocritical. Give your nephew a chance to have future birthday parties. Being right is great, but not to the expense of everything and everyone else.\n\nEdit: some of y'all are so focused on being right you lose everything else.", "Soft YTA. You are totally right. She is skating around the edges of lies so she can call herself by her religion though since most of her guests were from her church it quite possibly could be the way that specific church approaches such things so that the families can still have some of the normal things without it being a sin. IMO it almost feels like she compromised by throwing an I love You party in the stead of a Birthday Party so that she could still have a party for her LO. It also seems to me that the members of the church don\u2019t see it as that big of a deal because not only did they join the party they also brought gifts. They all know it\u2019s a birthday party but aren\u2019t allowed to call it a birthday party. As she is a fairly new member (a couple years vs raised in the church) she probably worries that she could be ostracized. People don\u2019t usually convert for no reason. I would say she probably truly wants to be a JW and believes in what they teach but also wants to try to be as normal as possible. I can imagine this causes her some stress as the changes can be quite drastic. If she is still trying to figure out the nuances of how to act within her church, keep decent relationships with a family who tries to support but doesn\u2019t understand, and figure out where the line is between the two she is likely unwilling to admit that she is wrong in this situation to someone outside of the church. Calling her out is not helpful to anyone.

How we dealt with this in my family was we'd have HUGE anniversary parties where even the kids of the couple got presents, we'd have a big family dinner on Black Friday, and we'd do a big shopping trip to hit the after Christmas sales so we'd have new stuff when we got back from winter break like all the other kids.\n\nIf you really wanted to make your point you could have said that *\"Only Jehovah sees what's in your heart and how would He feel that by all appearances this was a Birthday celebration?

If the religious person thinks that some kinds of meat are worse than other kinds or thinks that eating certain things on certain days matters, or if they think that calling a party a certain thing matters... why should I give a fuck? Why would I bother wasting energy trying to convince someone that one little part isn't true? The whole fucking thing is a scam and a joke, and you want me to give a fuck about what they call a kid's party? Frankly, no. I will not give a shit. They can call their shit whatever they want to. It doesn't make a lick of difference.", "I'm so disappointed that he's allowing his children to be raised as JW.", "I feel like most people don't really take their families opinion on SO's that much into consideration.", "edited to add", "Edited to add", "ETA: Edited/Edit to add\n\nIt took me a while to figure that one out", "Edited to add: not the asshole", "Ha! It's like the hyperjet speeds in Space Balls", "They toe the hypocrisy line like professional ballerinas. The cognitive dissonance is Strong in there.", "Ohh the good ol loophole", "They can disfellowship her, which means she\u2019s ostracized from her new cult friends. It doesn\u2019t sound like Lucy\u2019s family are JWs so she\u2019d be better off than most. People kill themselves after being disfellowshipped because they are cut off from friends and family.", "They have a whole body of \"elders\" for situations such as this. Yes, she could actually get in trouble.", "Cults are like that", "Yeah, I mean if the kid needs a life-saving blood transfusion is the mother gonna deny it even though the dad wants it? What happens then?", "So we have to be respectful of their beliefs and traditions and keep our mouth shut, but they don't afford us the same respect?", "Because it\u2019s annoying. Can\u2019t you see how hearing her bitch and whine about us throwing parties then her throwing one is annoying?", "But why do you care if she cares?", "And this will get me downvoted but JW is a cult. He is allowing his child to be raised in an actual cult.", "A girl I went to high school with was disfellowshipped & the entire scenario ended with her dying by suicide. It was an absolute tragedy. Her parents refused to host a funeral because of the manner of her death & left her twin brother to have to fundraise for it & then he was disfellowshipped after that.", "Aside from being tossed out of the church, what other ramifications could she face? Legitimate question.", "Hopefully, she'll at least decide it's a love transfusion, instead.", "The courts get involved and the mother risks losing custody, because that is not legal.", "You think she told him about that? Most witnesses are not forthcoming with information that makes them look bad, even avoiding going to the police or court to save face for the \"organization.\"", "Here's some more familiar examples for you:\n\na devout Catholic who's very pro life until it's her pregnant 14 year old daughter\n\nAn old Catholic grandpa who says \"we're all children of God, no matter what color\" until his grandkid brings a POC significant other to the reunion\n\nA Catholic parent who is com with all their kids friend except the flamboyant one because \"he's one of those\"\n\nYour SIL threw an \"I love you\" party instead of a birthday party\n\nSame shit, different day. Don't get on her bad side or you might lose visiting rights with your nephew.

I was shunned by her and everyone I knew\u2026.F that CULT!", "I wanted to call it a cult but I also didn\u2019t want to get demolished. I 100% believe it\u2019s a cult. It\u2019s horrific.", "I'm not sure it qualifies as an actual cult due to the lack of a single individual at the top. I do agree with your point, though.", "God they are the worst. I had a family member die of suicide after being disfellowshipped as well.", "Being ostracized from your entire \u201csupport group\u201d can be pretty detrimental, especially with intense groups (cults) like this.", "> feeding into her delusions (it's not a birthday party!) will just create more problems further down the line.\n\nI mean, you could say this about anything. Christians honestly believe a man came back from the fucking dead. Catholics believe they drink his blood and eat his flesh every week!!! And you're here acting like calling a birthday party the wrong name is delusional?", "Just because.", "Saying that a birthday party *is not* a birthday party because you have decided to make up a different name for it - and expecting everyone else to agree that it's not a birthday party - is indeed delusional.\n\nIf SIL was honest, that's it's a birthday party by any other name as a workaround for her joyless religion, then it would be fine. But she is insisting that it is functionally different. She wants OP to live in a false reality - ie a delusion.", "> Saying that a birthday party is not a birthday party because you have decided to make up a different name for it - and expecting everyone else to agree that it's not a birthday party - is indeed delusional\n\nSo you take issue with the name of the party and not the reason for the name involving the teachings of a 2000 year old undead fortune teller??? If you're going to let \"believing in a Sky Wizard who killed his own kid and then brought him back to life\" slide but harp on about \"I love you party\" being delusional, you're more of a hypocrite than SIL.\n\n>If SIL was honest, that's it's a birthday party by any other name as a workaround for her joyless religion\n\nBut then it wouldn't be a workaround because it would be a birthday party.", ">a different name for the same thing.\n\n\"THE SAME THING\"\n\nI feel like you're *so close* to actually getting it here, mate..", "So you admit it\u2019s a cop out?", "That's exactly what I said to OP. Give it a rest, who gives a shit what someone calls a birthday party? It's not your religion, it's not your birthday and it's not your party, so give it a rest.", "Yeah, no shit, they're the same. So how can calling it one of the two things that are the same be dishonest? If a mutt and a pooch are the same, is it dishonest to say that I have a mutt, even if you would call it a pooch?", "Of course, but what's it to you? It's not your religion, and even if it is, you're not the one worshipping for SIL, so why do you give a fuck if SIL cops out? From where I stand, it's all made up so who gives a shit if someone makes it up how they want to? Far be it from me to tell someone they made up their made up thing the wrong way."]}
