It caused a bit of a problem in her marriage as my brother, \u201cTodd\u201d, didn\u2019t want to convert and the church (at least the one she attends) encourages you to cut out those who will not follow the teachings. I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened but Todd and Lucy have remained married. He hasn\u2019t joined the church, she attends and said they\u2019d raise their future children doing so. Our family has been supportive, once we got over the hurdle of her trying to convert us.\n\nIt has been a little tricky as Lucy doesn\u2019t celebrate holidays and will scoff invited. So, Todd will go by himself and she resents not being invited. We\u2019ve let it know, if she wants to come, then she\u2019s more than welcome, but we\u2019re not going to just not have celebrations.\n\nLucy has also told us since she joined the church to not get her gifts and she won\u2019t get us any. We were okay with that. \n\n\nLast year, Lucy and Todd welcomed their son, \u201cAndrew\u201d. His first birthday was on Saturday. I wasn\u2019t expecting a party but then Lucy said they were having an \u201cI love you\u201d party for him. It seemed like a cop out but my husband and I agreed to bring our daughter (2) to the party.\n\nAgain, Lucy has stated several times that she and Andrew cannot give or receive gifts on holidays and birthdays. She even said no birthday gifts. So, I didn\u2019t get him anything, though I helped my daughter make a card that just said \u201cWe love you, Andrew!\u201d\n\nThe party was mostly Lucy\u2019s church friends. She doesn\u2019t have a large extended family, myself and Todd\u2019s lives in a different state. When we arrived, the table was stacked with presents. We were the only ones who didn\u2019t get him something. I heard someone from the church calling it an \u201cI love you\u201d gift but didn\u2019t want to make a thing of it.\n\nMonday, Lucy called and the subject of the party came up. I was trying to understand the difference between a birthday and what the party was. She just kept saying it was different and they weren\u2019t technically celebrating his birthday. I said it was semantics really. It\u2019d be one thing if they celebrated it on a random day but it was on his birthday. She accused me of judging her religion and I said no, I just think that this is a cop out. It\u2019s totally fine to celebrate your child. I love my nephew and will do my best to be at every party. But that 100% was a birthday party. She can dress it up as she wants,  but that\u2019s what it is.\n\nLucy said I was a judgmental bitch and hung up. Todd is actually on my side but feels I shouldn\u2019t have said it. He wanted to and kept quiet to keep peace.

Do you want this child to never have another birthday party? If so that was the way to go about it. With extremely strict religions/cults like this you don't want to ride your high horse around the paddock. You want to give them the space to slowly but surely separate themselves from the doctrine. What you did forced her further into the us vs them rhetoric. What you want is for her to notice the world isn't what JWs say it is. Give her the space to be hypocritical. Give your nephew a chance to have future birthday parties. Being right is great, but not to the expense of everything and everyone else.\n\nEdit: some of y'all are so focused on being right you lose everything else.", "Soft YTA. You are totally right. She is skating around the edges of lies so she can call herself by her religion though since most of her guests were from her church it quite possibly could be the way that specific church approaches such things so that the families can still have some of the normal things without it being a sin. IMO it almost feels like she compromised by throwing an I love You party in the stead of a Birthday Party so that she could still have a party for her LO. It also seems to me that the members of the church don\u2019t see it as that big of a deal because not only did they join the party they also brought gifts. They all know it\u2019s a birthday party but aren\u2019t allowed to call it a birthday party. As she is a fairly new member (a couple years vs raised in the church) she probably worries that she could be ostracized. People don\u2019t usually convert for no reason. I would say she probably truly wants to be a JW and believes in what they teach but also wants to try to be as normal as possible. I can imagine this causes her some stress as the changes can be quite drastic. If she is still trying to figure out the nuances of how to act within her church, keep decent relationships with a family who tries to support but doesn\u2019t understand, and figure out where the line is between the two she is likely unwilling to admit that she is wrong in this situation to someone outside of the church. Calling her out is not helpful to anyone.

How we dealt with this in my family was we'd have HUGE anniversary parties where even the kids of the couple got presents, we'd have a big family dinner on Black Friday, and we'd do a big shopping trip to hit the after Christmas sales so we'd have new stuff when we got back from winter break like all the other kids.\n\nIf you really wanted to make your point you could have said that *\"Only Jehovah sees what's in your heart and how would He feel that by all appearances this was a Birthday celebration?

There seems to be no standard definition and the ones I find are wide enough to fit a lot of groups.  I look a cult as one where it is all about getting money and power for the people at the top, and no actual faith.  I don't think Catholicism is a cult - though they need to take a long hard look at themselves, because they have a terrible past, and still pull some pretty heinous crap sometimes.  Some of their 'beliefs' seem more outdated rules.  I was raised a catholic and came to hate it - as you were praised for simply going along with everything, and punished for asking simple, honest questions (a child's perspective - but still).  So much pomp and ceremony, so many rules and requirements, and yet I found members who had no faith at all.  I very much see a distinction between cults and organised religion, but I have a problem with both.", "Depends which definition of 'cult' you are using.  Do you mean \"a system of religious beliefs and ritual\"?  Or \"a system of religious veneration and devotion directed towards a particular figure or object\"?  Or \"a small religious group that is not part of a larger and more accepted religion?  Or \"a group that has beliefs regarded by many people as extreme or dangerous?\"  Or \"a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious\"?  Or \"a term that doesn't refer to religion at all, but is applied to a social movement\"?  Or \"a person or group that uses undue influence to overcome the free will and judgment of another person\".  Or ???  \n\nIt's extremely easy to pick a definition that supports your personal view.  And it's amazing how often people say some version of 'Oh no, *MY* religion isn't a cult (even though it meets some/most of the definitions above); those guys over there in Not-My-Religion definitely are though!'  Even within a particular religion, you can find some branches that act in a more cult-like way than others, even though they are supposedly following the same teachings/doctrine.\n\nJust about every single religion ever began as a cult based on the majority of these definitions.  Some managed to stick around long enough to become widespread and more widely accepted, but they *DO* still meet many definitions of cult even then.  \n\nSteven Hassan's [BITE Model of Authoritarian Control](https://freedomofmind.com/bite-model/) is one way of considering if something is a cult-like or not.  I.e., where the overall effect of the behaviour, information, thought and emotional components promotes dependency and obedience to some leader or cause, and has some level of [undue influence](https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/) that overcomes the free will and judgment of another person.  \n\nOf course, cults can be benign in terms of how much they overcome people's free will and judgement.  \"As long as people are freely able to join with informed consent (which includes full and honest disclosure of the group\u2019s doctrine and practices), and can choose to disaffiliate without shunning, fear, or harassment, then it is not a destructive cult.\"  This isn't to say that such a cult doesn't have harmful practices though, just that people are free to choose to join or leave if they wish.", "The poophole loophole, if you will.", "\ud83c\udfb6Fuck me in the ass cause I love Jesus\ud83c\udfb6", "I appreciate your condolences.

The conversation became too broad, ignoring the finer, more specific critiques the book was trying to make. I see the same thing happening with JWs. That's how I made the connection that it ironically protects them. It diverts attention away from what they're actually doing and on to a different kind of critique (one that, again, risks alienating one's audience; and if the goal is to persuade people away from JWs, starting at \"all religion is a cult\" isn't an effective starting point). \n\nI like using the BITE model to define a cult, which stands for \"behavioral control,\" \"information control,\" \"thought control,\" and \"emotional control.\" It places less emphasis on beliefs and more on how these beliefs are enforced. When you apply this model, you can start to see how different belief systems cause different levels of harm. Some specific things JWs do that fall under the BITE model would be separation of families, dictating who members are allowed to associate with, deliberate shunning or withholding of any information that disagrees with JW values, and instilling fear of the outside world.", "I personally don't think I could refrain from singing \"A Very Merry Unbirthday\" from Alice in Wonderland.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsZT7WKjW8", "ESH.

This is 100% a birthday party. But the point in question isn\u2019t whether or not this was a birthday party. The point in question is whether you were being TA or not. And whether or not you believe it or not, if you go around trying to poke holes in how people express their beliefs, you are 100% being TA to them. But again, everything is subjective. And also in life, sometimes you have to be TA to do the right thing, so it\u2019s purely a judgment call. \n\nIf the question was \u201cdid I do the right thing?\u201d then the answer is more nuanced.

The elders will interrogate her on every aspect of her life, particularly given that she is married to an unbeliever.  And when I say 'every aspect' of her life, I mean it.  They will be relentless.
