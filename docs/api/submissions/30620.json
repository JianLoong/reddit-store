My sister, Lia whose 25, unexpectedly had a miscarriage a week ago. I felt especially guilty because I recently had found out I was pregnant as well, but had opted to wait to tell anyone.\n\nI felt guilty, so I elected to keep quiet about it for as long as I could, as I didn\u2019t want to take any attention away from her grief or cause her any pain. This became a problem when my family arranged a little get together at her place to help her feel better, where alcohol was to be involved.\n\nThe night was going fine, and my sister really seemed to be smiling and enjoying herself. I was staying away from the beer and vodka, kinda shutting down the strange looks from my family/friends, who know I almost never turn down the opportunity to drink. Most were believing my lies except my sisters friend, Ash, who came up to me and asked \u201cAre you pregnant or something? Why aren\u2019t you drinking?\u201d \n\nI laughed and said I had to watch out for my health and, trying to change the subject. My sister saw us talking however, and came up with a shot in her hand. She basically said that she was really glad I was here and wanted to take a shot with me. I had a feeling that Ash had told her I wasn\u2019t drinking and had come to confirm her suspicions\u2026I turned her down and said that I was just happy to be in the moment with her. Lia got this teary look on her face and kinda eyed my stomach. She set the drink down and asked me slowly if I was pregnant and trying to hide it.\n\nI froze in the moment, which must\u2019ve basically confirmed what she was suspecting. She burst into tears and asked again, much louder this time which caused most of the people in her apartment to look at us. She told me to either drink the shot or tell her the truth. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do so I opted to just tell her the truth. I tried to tell her that I didn\u2019t really want to take any attention away from her pain but she wasn\u2019t listening. She started accusing me of coming to her apartment to \u201cboast about my pregnancy\u201d and how I always got what I wanted. She also said that shouldn\u2019t have come to the party knowing that I couldn\u2019t drink and that I obviously knew that people were going to know I was pregnant. Basically going on about how I was attention seeking. At this point our dad stepped in to calm her down cause she was belligerent at this point. At that point me and my boyfriend decided it was better for us to just leave. I even got a few quiet \u201ccongrats\u201d, which I felt awful about.\n\nShe\u2019s not really talking to me right now, which I kind of understand but at the same time all I really wanted was to be there for her? People are more so leaning in her side because she\u2019s going through a hard time right now but I feel like I\u2019m not being listened to. My mom told me that she understands but that it was wrong of me to come knowing I was pregnant. \n\nEdit: I know you guys may find it strange we partied after her miscarriage so soon, that\u2019s just how my family is. We drink and get together after funerals too. We aren\u2019t really the type to mope around in our feels. We like to be together and have fun as family when things are hard.

It was not her place to escalate the situation.  \nIt's perfectly fine to attend a social gathering without drinking.", "Hardest NTA I can possibly give. \n\nIf you opted to not go on the basis of \u201cI normally drink people might find out\u201d I would have leaned the opposite. Your sister had a horrible thing happened, you should have been there to support, regardless whether you were pregnant or not, and you knew that. \n\nAsh was very obviously wanting to stir drama, and your sister knew before she asked, we all know that. She only pushed it to publicly \u201cshame\u201d you. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine the horror of a miscarriage, but like every suffering, it\u2019s not an excuse to act like an AH, which your sister did.\n\nIt was a lose lose situation, you did absolutely the best you could. I wouldn\u2019t take them siding with her to heart, in all reality, you\u2019d \u201cside\u201d with her too, she\u2019s hurting, people want to do whatever they can to support her.\n\nCongrats on the pregnancy, but you have to remember, your pregnancy isn\u2019t hers, it\u2019s not related, never has been, never will be, and you can\u2019t let it, because it creates so much bitterness around a baby that doesn\u2019t deserve it. You get to take an incredible journey, this silly thing isn\u2019t worth missing out on the joy.\n\nAlso, try your absolute best to cast it aside, stress makes pregnancies so much harder on you and the baby. You don\u2019t need that. If it\u2019s what it takes, go to therapy or something, whatever you need to destress.", "NTA. You wanted to comfort your sister and really did everything you could to be discreet about your pregnancy. I guess that a number of people probably guessed or suspected based on your description, but because they are not insensitive AH's they kept quiet about it.\nThis one friend really had to push. What an AH - they could have just kept their mouth shut, there really was no reason to confront you. They are the one to blame for bringing this to the surface.\nIf you had not come,they might have blamed you for not caring to support your sister.", "The easiest excuse for not drinking at a party is \"I'm driving\".  Unless you walked there?\n\nPeople need to stop making it their business to ensure that other people consume alcohol.\n\nAnd your sister needs to understand that the universe is not about her.  You do not appear to have done anything to 'boast' about your pregnancy, you were discreet, and frankly, she behaved very badly.  It's true that the miscarriage is a very recent event, but, um, she's having a party put on for her, and apparently enjoying it, which would tend to suggest that she is coping okay.\n\nYour family would probably have been angry with you for declining to go to your sister's consolation party, and would have pushed you into revealing your pregnancy anyway, or be reviled for not caring about your sister.  You could not win, here, because for some reason nobody is allowed to be pregnant when your sister has miscarried.  This is unreasonable.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If your sister didn\u2019t want to hear the truth she shouldn\u2019t have pushed you - \u201cdrink this shot or you\u2019re pregnant\u201d is a bullshit test. You didn\u2019t boast anything you tried to fly as under the radar as possible, if you\u2019d said you can\u2019t make it she would have put the pressure on just the same to find out why.", "Tip for the future: if asked why you aren\u2019t drinking, tell people you have a bad tooth or an ear infection and you\u2019re taking antibiotics. If they say \u201coh one won\u2019t hurt\u201d laugh and say \u201cyeah, I made that mistake once before, never again!\u201d For added realism lookup how some antibiotics interact with alcohol and claim those symptoms. \n\nNTA btw. You couldn\u2019t win either way. If you didn\u2019t go you would have been blasted for being unsupportive. You did go and have been lasted for it. You tried your best.", "NTA.

You tried to handle this sensitive situation as best as you could. Life's tricky sometimes.", "NTA. But I have to ask why is your family so hell bent on investigating why someone isn't drinking?", "NTA, like, at all. You tried your best to hide your pregnancy so it would not cause her pain. It's not your fault that her friend asked you all those questions, but the friend is an AH for bringing up a very sensitive topic when your sister miscarried just a week ago. And it's not fair for people to say you should not have come. It's them that shouldn't have questioned you not drinking, and also if you hadn't shown up they might have said you weren't there for your sister when she was going through a tough time. I understand your sister's reaction because she's grieving so it's hard to judge her for her reaction but 1) you did nothing wrong, and 2) I hope that friend apologises for the hurt she caused numerous people.", "NTA you either went and risked \u201cshowing\u201d you\u2019re pregnant, or not showing up and not being there to support your sister.\n\nIt\u2019s a shitty choice, but you were right. If Ash noticed and made a point of highlighting your lack of drinking to your sister then fuck them!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m a bad liar, even if I rehearsed the lie as in \u201ctaking antibiotics\u201d or whatever excuse would have given me away because I immediately blush when I lie. \n\nBut, I would have taken 0% drinks, poured my own drinks and probably faked it through to try and not draw attention to me. (It\u2019s how I did it with all my pregnancies). \n\nAsh was an AH. \n\nYour sister reacted out of grief. \n\nCongratulations on the pregnancy!", "NTA at all but as someone who was recently pregnant if you ever need reasons you\u2019re not drinking:\n\n1. I\u2019m driving\n2. I\u2019m on antibiotics that won\u2019t let me drink \n3. Super hungover from last night lol\n4. Walk around with a beer can that you dumped and cleaned and refill with water. If ppl offer you shots tell them it\u2019s a beer only night and not doing liquor", "NTA\nDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\nShe\u2019d have been upset if you didn\u2019t attend the gathering.", "NTA\nClearly the \u201cfriend\u201d in this situation escalated this into a needless upset. Your sister wrongly took out her grief on you and you probably need help making it up again through your family. I would stay well away from that supposed friend though.", "I think the other comments are doing well at pointing out just how much Ash sucks and that this entire mess is her fault. \n\nI think it's worth noting that Ash not only antagonized a grieving woman, she also made a pregnant woman the target and stole your chance to announce your baby and celebrate it with your family at a later time. Instead your pregnancy was announced by your screaming grieving sister and even your mom is kinda blaming you. \n\nI really hope when Lia is better she is able to see her friend for who she is and dumps her. I hope your whole family bans this particular \"friend\" from future gatherings. \n\nNTA", "It was a lose lose situation.  The best answer would have been ... doctor has advised to let liver rest for a bit.", "Hard NTA.\n\nSister\u2019s friend should have kept her mouth shut.", "NTA but does Ash like your sister at all because that\u2019s fucked up of her to point it out (if she did)", "If everyone jumps to \u201cyou must be pregnant\u201d for not having one drink one night, that has me startled.", "That Ash is the asshole here.", "NTA\n\nIf you had tried to come up with a reason to not attend, I\u2019m sure everyone would have called you the asshole for that too. There was really no winning and you did the best you could in the situation.", "NTA. What the hell was wrong with that \u201cfriend\u201d of your sisters where she couldn\u2019t keep her damn questions to herself? Why is she so damn nosy that she just had to start drama? Seriously, what is wrong with her? Your intentions and your sister\u2019s reaction were innocent, in my opinion, and both understandable given each of your situations. What I don\u2019t understand is why your sister\u2019s so called friend had to cause your sister more pain?", "NTA\n\nPeople should not ask questions the answers to which they do not want to hear.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. And this \"it's a party so you MUST drink\" thing is ridiculous.", "NTA, grief and alcohol both clouded your sister's judgement. I don't know the right path forward, if there even is one.\nI would let it rest and not talk about your pregnancy for a good while. In a month or 2 I guess I would try to have a conversation about it with your sister unless she wants one earlier and it's a calm one.\n\nFor now I'd let her know through your mom, that if she wants to, you are there for her, but no hard feelings, if it's too much at the moment.\n\nTime doesn't heal all wounds, but time calms emotions and allows for reason to return.", "The easiest thing people can do is just accept a \"no, thanks, but I'll take -insert non-alcoholic drink here-\" as a no without causing a fuss\n\nThere are so many non-pregancy related reasons to not drink, NONE of which were the person who caused drama's business\n\nI offer people something to drink, I get them what they ask for \n\nI don't offer anything specific, I usually just list what we have, both alcoholic, and non\n\nBecause I'm am adult, and I know that it's none of fucking business what people put in their body, unless they decide to make it my business, or its harmful (like, say, accidentally picking up the bottle of window spray that I had previously filled with blue poweade as a joke BUT IS NOW ACTUALLY WINDOW SPRAY) \n\nI will say something then\n\nAbsolute hard NTA", "\"Why are you not drinking, OP?\"\n\n'Because I don't feel like it.'\n\nEND SCENE \n\nNTA\n\nLet's normalize people not needing alcohol to have a good time at social events, even if they would drink normally.

It's not logical, it's pure emotional dumpage on you for being human.", "NTA. \n\nAs a woman with a history of miacarriage, shes taking out her pain on you.

You can move them to the basement or attic when they get too big for that.\n\nNaturally, you would be able to introduce your child to the rest of the family after your sister has a baby of her own, just make sure that you tell everyone the child is a year younger than their cousin. \n\nOh!

OR MAYBE AGAIN YOU JUST SIMPLY DONT WANT TO. i don\u2019t understand at all", "I see these posts all the time and I just don\u2019t get it. I understand that going through a miscarriage is terrible, but why have we just decided it\u2019s ok for those women to then get mad at pregnant women for being pregnant??? It\u2019s the biggest case of misplaced aggression I can think of and yet I see it constantly, and nobody ever defends the pregnant woman. \n\nIs it an unpopular opinion to say that nobody should have to hide their pregnancy because another person suffered a miscarriage? That\u2019d be like hiding the fact you have parents from somebody who recently lost one. It\u2019s nonsense to me, and yet people support this position all the time. It\u2019s absolutely a no-win situation. OP goes to the party and people figure it out. OP doesn\u2019t show up and people are wondering why she isn\u2019t there. \n\nAs another comment said, hardest NTA I can possibly give.", "Ngl this sounds made up", "NTA ,If you didn't go to the party they would have accused you if being insensitive and not being there in her \"time of need\"", "NTA\n\nThough I\u2019d consider the quality of the company I\u2019m keeping if *not* drinking is a point of contention.

You where trying not to make a scene and point to spotlight on you.  Yeez the world has really gone mad.", "Sorry I don\u2019t believe this is real. If it is, NTA? But this seems fictional.", "What lies were these ? Because I would\u2019ve came up with a fake injury and fake medication that can\u2019t be mixed.

Or I would\u2019ve simply made up a lie and said I was busy and couldn\u2019t make it but promised to take her out the next day for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I\u2019m just not understanding here. But no I don\u2019t think you are the asshole it\u2019s a messed up situation for the both of you there was probably never going to be a right time to tell her honestly. She could\u2019ve grieved for awhile. some women never get over it.", "You're NTA, but I'm concerned your family might have a severe alcohol problem. Who organizes a party of heavy drinking *one week* after a difficult and emotional miscarriage? And encourages the survivor to go to town on vodka while her body is still in recovery? (Is your sister not on any medications right now?) That seems like a recipe for trouble, as is, without any other complications. \n\nAnd at the very young age of 22, you already drink so heavily and so often at parties that it's super conspicuous for you to NOT have a drink in your hands the whole time? Even when your family is present and you might reasonably not want to get tipsy around them, considering the highly emotionally charged circumstances surrounding the party? \n\nNo judgment, but you might want to keep an eye on your family and their relationship with alcohol, and keep a therapist on standby if you ever decide you need one. Every family is different and maybe this is normal where you live, but it's not normal to me, if that makes sense. \n\nBut you did absolutely nothing wrong and I'm sorry your family is doing this to you.", "NTA, you just wanted to support her.  You weren\u2019t trying for attention.  If you\u2019d ditched the party that would have upset her too. The bottom line is that she\u2019s grieving, everything to do with pregnancy and babies and life going on hurts her right now, and only time will make that better.  \n\nIf you\u2019re ever in that situation again, though, your excuse is Tylenol.  You can\u2019t combine it with alcohol, you can send yourself into liver failure and die.  So you say had a bad headache, you took like twice the dose on the bottle so you could be there, but the booze is a no go for the night.", "NTA  \nAnd wth is going on with Ash? Why would you push the subject? Your sister needs better friends. What an AH move from them.", "NTA, but Ash sure is.  Sorry, OP! Your sister is hurt, and Ash seems to be feeding her pain. Ash caused the drama not you.\n\nBe well and stand up for yourself. Best of luck and congratulations.", "NTA You tried to be discreet and be there for her. She made the party about you. Just give her space she's probably still in pain and looking for someone to lash out at", "NTA this is a real dammed if you do and damned if you don\u2019t situation. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t go everyone would call you an unsupportive AH, so you did the best thing possible which was to go and try to keep quiet. I probably would have pulled the deso driver card because health concerns are always a little suss but that friend is the real AH here.", "NTA. You tried to keep it under wraps. You even explained that you wanted to focus on your health and not drink. Ash had to be an A H and start drama, and your sister tried to force you to drink. Only then did it come out because you froze. No one expects to be put in a position like that. \n\nAlso, if you didn't show, it would have been another drama. You were in a lose-lose situation. \n\n\nHopefully, you're never in this situation again, but rather than be bugged about why I'm not drinking, I usually have a decoy drink. I don't drink because it reacts with my medicine and don\u2019t want to explain it all night. If it's at a bar, I get a coke with an olive and stirrer straw. If it's at someone's house, I'll get a beer, dump it, and fill it with water so I don't accidentally drink it when I'm not paying attention. People don't ask when you have a drink in your hand. Sometimes, a weirdo will ask why I'm nursing one drink so long, and then I just say I'm a lightweight. It's ridiculous that others care if you drink or not. I'm not stopping someone else from drinking. What should it matter.", "NTA\n\n\nBut for the future just say that you are taking antibiotics. For whatever.", "So if you didn\u2019t turn up they\u2019d think you were mean for not supporting her? NTA, you tried your best to hide it.", "Why are you guys getting pregnant so young?

Your sister should not have asked questions she didn't want the answer to.", "NTA. You tried to be very kind and you cared about her feelings a lot. What she said is just because of the loss and pain she feels. I wouldn\u2019t take it as her true opinion. It\u2019s just bad timing. You were right to tell her the truth when asking for it. The situation was bad. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have attended the party limit the risk but I totally understand that you wanted to be there for her. Maybe she would be mad about that too. So I think you couldn\u2019t handle it better than you did. I hope when she is feeling better with her grief (which may take some time of cause) she will understand your situation.", "NTA. Why did that \u201cfriend\u201d try to hurt your sister? He could have kept his suspicions to himself and not put you in this position in the first place.", "Why didn\u2019t you just say you were on antibiotics and were advised not to drink? If she pushed it, just say it was a genital infection that you\u2019re slightly embarrassed to talk about in public. Then offer to show her the oozing?", "NTA. Were you not to come, people would have had questions about why you didn't come as \"you almost never turn down an opportunity to drink\", and since it was something to cheer her up a little, some people (Ash especially) would have told her what a bad sister you are for not being there for her. Your sister is not really an AH either. She's still grieving, acted irrationally, and was kind of encouraged by Ash to act this way. Give her some space, she might come around.", "NTA clearly, but, please try not to be too angry with your sister. She's going through some shit right now and is lashing out. It's not an excuse, but it is an explanation. \n\nCongratulations by the way!", "She set you up to fail and all these people who say you should have done something differently are AH\u2019s. \n\nShe organized an event to be together as a family after her miscarriage and if you would not have shown up without giving the real reason she would have blamed you for missing such an important event in her life and you prioritizing yourself over her.\n\nYou did not plan the pregnancy and miscarriage to coincide and you showing up like that not drinking is perfectly fine.\n\nYour sister and mother are behaving like AHs though.\n\nNTA", "NTA - take it from a woman who had several miscarriages. Yes it sucks, but you don't get to make others miserable because of it. Your sister obviously had suspicions, and it seems she was jealous and wanted to ruin your pregnancy announcement. It was on purpose. Don't fall for it. Enjoy your pregnancy and don't let your sister dim your happiness.", "Ash is the biggest AH of all. She stirred up shit ON PURPOSE.", "NAH. She's currently hurting , but you didn't do anything wrong\n\nHowever, this may be a bit late now, but when you don't want to drink and don't want others to question you? Just say \"oh sorry, can't, I'm on some meds currently, they don't mix well.\"\n\nUsually most people will just leave it at that. If not, just say it's some specific painkiller or along those lines. Easy way to avoid such line of questioning, and most people will lose interest in questioning you after that.", "All of those people need therapy", "in what world is you must be pregnant the first thing someone thinks when they see a woman not drinking alcohol?", "What is this?

Just give her space.", "NAH for being pregnant and being happy about it, but you could have held ofc with your news for a little while longer, if you really had wanted to.\n\nYou could've just said you weren't drinking because you were on antibiotics / you were on a detox in preparation for the Christmas season / you were doing a sponsored thing for charity / supporting a friend that was going through an issue with drink or a million other things to deflect people from playing the \"Is she pregnant game?\"", "INFO: What do you normally drink? Beer, wine, mixed drinks, etc.\n\nI'm currently leaning towards y t a since you knew it would be conspicuous that you weren't drinking and would cause exactly what happened, that suspicions would be raised and the cat would be out of the bag. But what else could you do, you ask. How about faking it. If you like mixed drinks, just pour yourself a vodka tonic without the vodka. It would look the same.

How would she have reacted if you didn't show up? It really seems like you couldn't win either way. \n\nAlso the fact that they put so much pressure on someone to drink is childish and fucked up. There are many reasons people don't drink and to pressure you to do so then force you to reveal personal information is gross\n \n\nNTA", "NTA. It's not okay to confront people about why they aren't drinking. I usually reply that I'm driving or that it'll interfere with my meds ( or I've taken anti histamines for hay fever) but it's none of their business. You could be pregnant and not ready to announce because you're not at 12 weeks and your sister is a really clear indication of why you would hold off announcing. It's also simply a very inappropriate time to confront someone about that. I don't know what your sister's friend hoped to achieve here.", "Rock Solid NTA. \n\nIf anyone\u2019s the A in this situation it\u2019s Ash. She should have minded her own business and left it alone, but instead she nastily told your sister to start unnecessary drama which was cruel. \n\nIm sorry, it sucks that your sister is going through such a hard time and I\u2019m sorry she lost her baby, I also hope you and your sister can make up.", "What's completely stupid is the idea that if someone's not drinking at a social gathering \"they must be pregnant\". \n\nBecause drinking is so essential to a gathering.", "I\u2019m trying to work out how you\u2019re in the wrong in their eyes.\n\nIf you\u2019re not flaunting it, then you\u2019re not being in her face about it.

The news of your pregnancy will come out sooner or later anyway and likely she'd still have a hard time with it.  \n\nAs for the drinking thing, she sounds like she approached you with the shot because she suspected and the accept/refuse wouldn't let you deny it.  She chose to force it out of you and she could have left it alone.  Personally, I take little breaks from drinking every so often.  Sometimes I decide I'm drinking too much or too often, sometimes it's a particularly big party where I go too hard.   My point is, it's pretty shitty of people to make an issue when people don't drink but still want to participate in social events.  By your Mom's logic I shouldn't attend any social events this weekend because I might upset people with my sobriety.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA drama always happens around people that are grieving.

What ever happened to just putting their inkling about your not drinking aside?\n\nYes, maybe you could have had a few excuses up your sleeve, or considered telling your sister prior to the party, but to be honest no one should have put you in a position of needing to do that. This was your news, and it's your call whether you drink if you weren't pregnant regardless.\n\nIt is sounding like your sister is harbouring some resentment that goes deeper than this, hence her insistence on 'outing' you here. I do appreciate that it's going to feel raw to hear of someone else's pregnancy given that she has experienced a loss, however you've not become pregnant to spite her. This is separate. She has to accept that her feelings are to do with her own very sad situation and not a slight against her from you. \n\nShe might not have suspected you were pregnant prior, but throwing a booze-fuelled party, drink-pushing and effectively bullying her guest into announcing a pregnancy wasn't a particularly wise move given that she apparently didn't want any pregnancies to be known on this occasion.

Did she have problem getting pregnant? She seems to want to make everything a big deal and everything about her, and is blowing this way out of proportion.

It's clear you wanted to be there for her and protect her feelings, which is a kind and empathetic act. Despite your good intentions, it seems the way things unfolded during the party made Lia feel hurt and overwhelmed. Your mom and others might lean towards supporting Lia because she's dealing with a really tough time, but your feelings and intentions are also important. I can see how upsetting and conflicting this is for you, feeling misunderstood and trying to navigate everyone's emotions.

You said it yourself, that your family knows that you never turn down a drink. If you are a regular/heavy drinker then it's very obvious that people would notice you not drinking.

Except for the friend, she heavily sucks.\n\nYou definitely could have thought up some excuses before arriving so that you wouldn't get the deer-in-the-headlights look.

I'm not accusing you of anything or agreeing with her obviously, but the firstborn being upset about a younger sibling getting better treatment isn't uncommon and I think there may be more for you two to work through than just this issue.\n\nEdited to add after rereading the post: Your sister sucks for trying to push a shot on to you, she kind of asked for an answer without asking for an answer directly and her friend's reaction made it 100x worse.

My sister, Lia whose 25, unexpectedly had a miscarriage a week ago. I felt especially guilty because I recently had found out I was pregnant as well, but had opted to wait to tell anyone.\n\nI felt guilty, so I elected to keep quiet about it for as long as I could, as I didn\u2019t want to take any attention away from her grief or cause her any pain. This became a problem when my family arranged a little get together at her place to help her feel better, where alcohol was to be involved.\n\nThe night was going fine, and my sister really seemed to be smiling and enjoying herself. I was staying away from the beer and vodka, kinda shutting down the strange looks from my family/friends, who know I almost never turn down the opportunity to drink. Most were believing my lies except my sisters friend, Ash, who came up to me and asked \u201cAre you pregnant or something? Why aren\u2019t you drinking?\u201d \n\nI laughed and said I had to watch out for my health and, trying to change the subject. My sister saw us talking however, and came up with a shot in her hand. She basically said that she was really glad I was here and wanted to take a shot with me. I had a feeling that Ash had told her I wasn\u2019t drinking and had come to confirm her suspicions\u2026I turned her down and said that I was just happy to be in the moment with her. Lia got this teary look on her face and kinda eyed my stomach. She set the drink down and asked me slowly if I was pregnant and trying to hide it.\n\nI froze in the moment, which must\u2019ve basically confirmed what she was suspecting. She burst into tears and asked again, much louder this time which caused most of the people in her apartment to look at us. She told me to either drink the shot or tell her the truth. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do so I opted to just tell her the truth. I tried to tell her that I didn\u2019t really want to take any attention away from her pain but she wasn\u2019t listening. She started accusing me of coming to her apartment to \u201cboast about my pregnancy\u201d and how I always got what I wanted. She also said that shouldn\u2019t have come to the party knowing that I couldn\u2019t drink and that I obviously knew that people were going to know I was pregnant.

Irrational thinking, I now know that but at the time it was my train of thought. \n\nLong story short, I agreed with my husband and told my twin sister that I was going to try it ONCE and only once and if it didn\u2019t happen then clearly it wasn\u2019t meant to be. \n\nHowever, amazingly, I got pregnant,the first IVF try ever. And even more amazingly, I was pregnant with twins. \n\n\nWhen we did the implantation, we had to wait two weeks to know if I was pregnant or not and once it was confirmed, I had to wait another two weeks to see the consultant who had a good look around, inside of me, using a pregnancy scan device and that\u2019s when I found out that I was having twins. \n\nI was so ecstatic, as was my husband, considering that I was pretty ok about it either way beforehand and I thought, wrongly as it turned out, that I was mentally great about having a baby versus not having one . I think it may have been a protection mode for myself, if I tell myself that I don\u2019t want children then I\u2019m not disappointed when it doesn\u2019t happen. \n\nBecause of the unusual circumstances of our situation and knowing by week 5 that I was pregnant with IVF twins, my husband and I started to tell those closest to us and those who needed to know that I was carrying precious cargo ( for example:  my work bosses needed to know as I was a frontline Cop and it had taken me so long to get to this position and I was deemed a high risk pregnancy as I was 36, it was IVF And twins ). \n\nA couple of days later as we neared the 6 week mark ( it\u2019s actually 4 weeks but for some reason, they add 2 weeks onto it for menstruation dates ), my twin sister announced in front of all of my family, some of whom I hadn\u2019t yet told and I had invited along  to impart our good news, that \n\n\u201cShe was going to steal my thunder because she had an announcement to make and she too was pregnant and depending upon the finer dates, we would be having our children around 6 weeks apart\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why but everything seemed to go into slow motion and I recall watching everyone congratulate her whilst I stood there, in shock, saying nothing. \n\nWhen personally reflecting upon that moment or when being reminded about it every once in a while by my sister, that I didn\u2019t immediately congratulate her and didn\u2019t seem overjoyed like she expected it, I just mumbled something about it was such a shock because she never wanted children and I was super surprised by her news!\n\nIn reality, I felt and I still do that she purposefully arranged to get pregnant, as much as she was able, in order to ( in her own words) \u201c steal my thunder \u201c because she was jealous and this was the one thing that she could potentially do to make herself feel better and elevated above me . \n\nThings have since happened whereby she has stolen from me and she has cut me out of her life when I calmly asked her about the stolen items ( which she was last seen taking out of my jewellery cabinet to try on and was photographed having her hair extensions done, paid for by me and in the photo taken of her hair, you can see the jewellery being worn by her in the same picture - items left to me by my dearly deceased mother). \n\nShe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, even getting remarried for the second time and not inviting me or my twins, yet inviting all the other members of our family.

In retrospect, if OP was going to be the AH either way, maybe staying home would have been better. But hindsight is 20/20.

I figured out that my husband's sister was pregnant because she always drinks wine at family get togethers and on this occasion she ordered a soft drink. And then I proceeded to not ask her about it or bring it up in any because fucking yikes. I just waited for her to announce when she was ready a few weeks later, like a normal person.", "So true!!", "I was going to suggest saying whatever she ate at lunch made her ill, but I like this better. A little concerned that this family is so into drinking culture, that someone not taking a shot turns into an EF Hutton moment. NTA though.", "I agree with this, though despite being a recovering alcoholic who also has medical issues AND is on meds that don\u2019t mix with alcohol\u2026somehow literally none of the above is accepted as a viable reason sometimes. Maybe *I* should just say I\u2019m pregnant \ud83e\udd14", "Bonus: you can get really ill if you mix alcohol with one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics (Bactrim) for a UTI. Same applies to Flagyl which is used to treat BV, if you ever need a different condition that people won\u2019t ask questions about", "Agree.   \nVirgin cocktails (mocktails) work, too. Somebody should be a designated driver. Can\u2019t be hungover for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ reason. Nurse the same beer all night. It can be hard to think of the right thing to say, in the moment. (for me, anyway\ud83d\ude1c) \n\nThe kind thing is to be compassionate and concerned in times like this. The pregnant person will have PLENTY of time to share the joy. Waiting until the second trimester is what a lot of people do, for a multitude reasons. A grieving person can still be happy for others. A pregnant person may feel like they shouldn\u2019t have to \u201ctamp down\u201d their experience, especially in from of \u201cfamily.\u201d A mature, sensible person knows that there are MANY times in life when one has to temper what they say to protect the heart of loved ones.   \n\n\nCONGRATS, OP!", "There's an antibiotic that makes alcohol basically poison. That's a fab excuse if needed.", "UTI is definitely a good excuse. I'm not pregnant yet, but my husband and I just recently quit alcohol while we prepare for pregnancy - but we don't want our parents to know we're trying (because LORD the pressure will be on).\n\nMy family aren't heavy drinkers, but we will usually all have a family toast or do one round of shots at big events such as birthdays/holidays/weddings/etc. My husband and I have been trading excuses so far: One of us is the designated driver and the other is either on antibiotics or recovering from a headache. Thankfully my family is the kind that /usually/ doesn't ask about it if someone turns down a drink.\n\nHusband's family is nosy as hell though - so I've been getting away with pouring coca cola in a tumbler with ice or water in a shot glass.", "I hate that you had to put so much thought into this, but it\u2019s a fantastic excuse", "That\u2019s fine, but they got an answer, and kept pushing", "I would've blamed acid reflux or something like that, but hindsight is 20/20.", "Devastating. But you don\u2019t take it out on other people. People are still gonna get pregnant.", "I tend to agree with your speculation.", "Honestly, I'd be pretty leery of being part of any group where the only reason a woman wouldn't do a shot was because she is pregnant.", "There\u2019re no issues with getting together and trying to have fun, partying and drinking, but there\u2019s definitely something wrong about not accepting \u201cno, I don\u2019t want a drink\u201d as a full, complete answer. That\u2019s a sign of a bad relationship with alcohol. Not wanting to drink for whatever reason is fine and trying to pressure anyone or ask why they don\u2019t drink is crappy behavior", "> I know majority of you will find it strange that we had a gathering so soon after a tragedy \n\nI find it strange that one is either drinking or pregnant in your family and friends circle. Is it not possible to decline a drink because you don't want to or something?", "While yea, it\u2019s strange that y\u2019all have an alcohol fueled *party* after someone miscarriages, what\u2019s concerning is that you family drinks so heavily that someone can\u2019t say no without raising an eyebrow. That\u2019s extremely alarming and shows that your family has a problem with alcohol.", "Not \"moping around in your feelings\" can equate to not feeling your feelings, which is when people turn to alcohol to numb their feelings, which is unhealthy. Your family doesn't sound like it has the best relationship with alcohol. I can almost always say, to any friend or family member, \"I don't feel like drinking tonight\" and no one bats an eye about it.", "Honestly, if I knew that was my family, I'd probably have opted not to go at all and just made up some excuse. Not to be rude, but your family/friend also seem a little bit extra with how much they bothered you about drinking and the ultimate reaction.\n\nBut generally, NTA.", "But your whole story demonstrates that it isn\u2019t helping your sister cope.", "So, was it before or after bursting into tears that your sister was definitely not moping and having fun to cope? I think your family probably has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol.", "The problem is that it doesn't seem like your sister was processing her grief at all. If you told us the story of a successful event that helped everyone heal, that would be something. Instead it was nasty and you described her behavior as belligerent. Do you really think it was successful?", "If you hadn't gone to the party she would be angry at you for that. You were going to lose either way.", "I thought getting together and having a party after a funeral was the normal thing? It's for the living anyway, better to have fun and remember the good times.", "Oooh, THAT's what happened? Lol I get it now", "doesn't have to be an assumption about being alcoholic. \"Is it ok\" works for a lot of circumstances: religion, personal choice, alcoholism, meds/health, trauma. It actually gets around specifics.", "I\u2019m not sure either of them have ever sought help.  Ellen talked about giving up drinking but in solidarity with a health thing I believe Portia was going through.  I think it was temporary.  \n\nMariah has an alcohol brand called Black Irish.  What was gross about this example was, like shitty Ashe in this story, Ellen kept pushing Mariah to drink champagne on the show or admit she was pregnant.  Mariah was visibly uncomfortable and ended up losing the pregnancy not long after that appearance.   Not implying correlation, just again, why you don\u2019t do this shit to people because you never know what\u2019s going with their body.", "Another option for people who want to hide it- antibiotics. You can say you're taking some antibiotics for  x (ear infection, tooth infection, burst cyst, whatever) and apparently it reacts really badly with alcohol.  But also people need to mind their dang business when someone refuses a drink.  Maybe the person just realized they have a problem and need to slow down on the drinking. Nta.", "I know ip was like \u201c we deal with things differently\u201d. Seems like they don\u2019t though. They have a party and cope. But based on the sisters reaction. They never actually deal with emotional issues. They just drink. Also I get that having a miscarriage is hard, but I have never thought this kind of thing is ok. Like get counseling and deal with your shit, you do not get to be mad about other people being pregnant. This shit has gone too far honestly and there are too many stories on here about women not dealing with a miscarriage at all and taking it out in everyone around them and so many enablers.", "EF Hutton moment \n\nPriceless \ud83e\udd0c", "Upvoting the mention of an \u201cE F Hutton moment\u201d.  It\u2019s been a while.", ">Maybe I should just say I\u2019m pregnant \ud83e\udd14\n\nBonus points if you are male!!", "Maybe I should start telling people that I\u2019m pregnant as well. I also had a hysterectomy.\n\nMy mil asked how I could still cramp and pms after a hysterectomy. Like\u2026miss ma\u2019am I still have an ovary, and my hormones don\u2019t discriminate. No uterus?? Cool. Let\u2019s cramp abdominal muscles!!!!", "Good to know, but I think that in general and this is just what I have done when I\u2019m not drinking, I always just say I\u2019m on antibiotics, and no one even bats an eye. \nIt\u2019s also smart to just make a drink that looks like a cocktail. It\u2019s really really easy like for yourself a glass of seltzer and put a lime in it and it looks like a vodka tonic. No one will ask you about your drink- just  assume you have a cocktail. \nI\u2019m super stealth at this move because my family are all alcoholics and when I was still in contact with them and having to endure family gatherings, I would not drink and it would be like a big fucking issue if I didn\u2019t have a reason and I couldn\u2019t use antibiotics every time so sometimes I just faked it.", "Cranberry juice is a good one because you usually only see it as a mixer.  Walk around with a red drink and everyone is gonna assume there is booze in it.", "My favorite excuse/method, but it does require a partner, is for the pregnant person to either directly ask for a drink like beer/wine or accept one when it is offered, and just pretend to sip and hold the drink. The partner would then take drinks of the pregnant persons drink. This was my job.  \n\nActually I don't even think you need a partner  you could just slowly dump part of the drink in the sink.", "This right here...also, just curious how far along OP was...if it was within 3 months she doesn't have to tell anyone anything so you can just lie if you're confronted.  No I'm not pregnant and no I'm not drinking your stupid shot. Sounds like a family with no boundaries and who don't really care for each other.", "True, but grief doesn\u2019t work like that, especially the trauma of pregnancy loss. I am NOT AT ALL blaming OP. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s understandable that the sister might be (even belligerently) drunk at this point and reacted horribly. \n\nIt\u2019s not right, but it\u2019s understandable. Both women are in incredibly unfair and awful situations in this context (OP being so horribly treated in this case). It fucking sucks. Like I said, I don\u2019t think sister was right, but I do think she deserves a little empathy and understanding. \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the internet strangers don\u2019t pass all of their judgment on a woman getting drunk when her baby literally died inside of her body a week ago. Just sayin\u2019.", "Of course it is, but the sisters goal here was clearly to confirm her suspicion that OP was pregnant and not actually get her to consume the shot.    It's natural to be suspicious when someone who you have never known to turn down a shot is suddenly not interested, and it's understandable that family would want to know what is going on.  Sister's motivations are from a place of hurt and she should've let it lie, but these actions could easily have happened in a different situation with more benign intentions.", "I had a similar thing but it was a work social event at a wine tasting. While I was early pregnancy, I was using the excuse that I had a 1.5hr drive home so that's why I wasn't drinking (which was true). I was told later that people didn't buy my \"driving excuse\", even though they had never seen me drinking at a work social event before.", "Really good point.", "Depends on where you live. In my country its pretty rare not to drink at a party", "Yes, but it can still be suspicious. I have some friends where if we are at a party and everyone is drinking if they say \"I'll just have a soda\" I will still suspect they're pregnant even if they have a different excuse. We aren't even big drinkers but a woman not drinking who normally does will get people wondering. One of my besties found out I was preggers because she suggested sushi for lunch and I said I just had sushi, let's go for bbq instesd", "Except it wasn't the drinking that upset her, it was finding out from her drama-loving \"friend\" that her younger sister is pregnant.", "<<waving hello from elsewhere on the wall>>", "Exactly.  When someone tells you \u201cNo\u201d then it\u2019s a complete sentence and you don\u2019t have the right to press them for a reason.  Nobody owes anyone a reason for turning down down a drink.  It really makes me angry when I see people asking questions after someone turns down a drink.  It\u2019s none of your business why they don\u2019t or can\u2019t want/have a drink. A belt their answer and move on n", "I actually don't get the gripe about how this family chooses to cope outside of them all showing extreme amounts of dependence on alcohol. I don't get why having a party and a couple drinks isn't a good way to deal with the emotional shit. She had a miscarriage, probably felt alone, hadn't been able to have a drink. They threw a party, surrounded her with her support group, and tried to have a good time to celebrate her. Why is that bad?\n\nI agree, again, that pushing shots on people and some of the ways they are engaging with alcohol are absolutely problematic, but I do not get the criticism for the premise of the party.", "Great idea! I'll remember that for next time! I like cranberry juice better than soda, and we're trying to be healthier. :)", "All I can say is that I've had multiple friends around me experience miscarriage, including when my daughter's best friend's mom lost her baby pretty late term when we were supposed to be due around the same time. Our families were basically attached at the hip before, and after, very understandably, it was pretty painful for her to be around us. \n\nNone of them have ever come even close to treating me like OP's sister and friends treated her. There's no excuse for pressuring people to drink, pressuring people to disclose a pregnancy, and especially acting like someone got pregnant to hurt you. \n\nPregnancy is a really sensitive and dangerous time for ALL women and NO pregnancy is guaranteed until it's over. I really don't understand why it's considered understandable for a woman who's experienced a pregnancy loss to be cruel to a pregnant women.", "Also, it\u2019s one thing to be belligerent because you\u2019re drunk, but OP says her sister (now sober) is STILL not talking to her.", "I do get pregnancy loss, believe me (two losses). It\u2019s just hard for me to imagine ever talking to someone like that, even drunk. But then, that\u2019s just me. We\u2019re all different.", "This is the most correct take", "> In my country its pretty rare not to drink at a party\n\nSure. But it shouldn't be a problem if you want to decline a drink just like it shouldn't be a problem if you want one right? You should be in charge of your own alcohol consumption.", "So your friends group basically thinks that a woman that isn't in a state of debauchary of one kind of another must be pregnant?", "You need to be better and do better if your first thought is that someone is pregnant when they decline a drink. That\u2019s really sad honestly.", "I think the point here is whether or not you suspect something or not, it\u2019s not up to anybody else to announce or reveal a pregnancy, but the person who is actually pregnant. No one stopping anybody from having suspicions. The problem is asking about someone\u2019s pregnancy or if someone\u2019s pregnant. If they wanted to tell you they were pregnant they would\u2019ve told you that they were pregnant. People should just respect the fact that if somebody doesn\u2019t want to drink and their adults, that should be the end of the conversation. It is not anyone\u2019s requirement to know if someone else is pregnant and it is not a pregnant woman\u2019s requirement to immediately notify everybody ever that she\u2019s pregnant unless it\u2019s her doctor, or the father of the child.", "But the fact is that the sister isn't coping well if she starts yelling at her sister for having the gall to be pregnant (like it's a personal attack), so the idea that the drinking party was some great coping mechanism is manifestly not true.", "It\u2019s not the party, I understand getting together with friends family to have a good time after a hard time. It\u2019s the alcohol. Too many people use it in unhealthy ways and think it\u2019s normal. The fact that the party devolved into what it did shows these people are not reasonable drinkers, use alcohol to bully family. I mean she knew before she went that it might be a problem. At no point should someone saying no to alcohol cause this much of a problem. And shes conditioned to think this behavior is normal. Having a get together with family is normal, being expected to get hammered or you going to get bullied about it is not. It\u2019s too common, it\u2019s gross, and people need to quit thinking it\u2019s ok. But more of my point was the behavior of punishing other women fit being pregnant after you have a miscarriage is also too much and gross. I\u2019ve seen too many stories on here about this, and can\u2019t believe how much it happens and then how much the families enable the behavior.", "I absolutely agree and I am so sorry for your losses. Ive been experiencing infertility for almost 2 decades and I am very much not the same person I was before. I definitely struggled with my sister\u2019s two pregnancies, and let her know. I did not talk to her (and never would) like this, but it was horrible, even while I love my sister and my niblings immensely. I just want other people to consider that even though her actions and words were awful, that her drunkenness and response were at least understandable if not okay.", "I agree 100%, just saying that it's not uncommon to get on the piss at events like this", "No. That's not what I said. I also don't know if this extends to other friends it is just a thought that pops up for me, I don't discuss it with anyone. \n\nLike I said, we aren't huge drinkers. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner or a couple beers over board games. But we have a lot of people in our circle who are actively trying to get pregnant and I would be lying if I said the thought doesn't pop up in my head if certain friends of mine who normally do drink decline the offer. \n\nI'm not saying that is the only explanation, and I'm not the type to push it. In fact, recently my husbands cousin who is a huge drinker and had expressed frustration at trying to get pregnant for many months to no avail said she would just have a water at our party and I offered a virgin mojito if she preferred and she jumped at it. Turns out she was in fact pregnant and appreciated a drink that looked alcoholic to keep suspicion at bay", "Agreed though. Like I said I would never comment on it. I literally just said it's a thought I would have. Why are people acting like this is a character flaw?", "Please list the coping mechanisms for grief that work 100% of the time then.
