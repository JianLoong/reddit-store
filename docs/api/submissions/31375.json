You can be pc and totally honest. - I live my cousin and her kids, but..... they are too much for them to handle and too much for me to handle. I'm tired, I'm pregnant, and I don't want to have to worry about everyone else and their kids this year. When they are older and a little more settled, we will have them over.", "NTA. It sounds like a second visit by that lot would demolish your home. Who needs that? Why do people get so many kids, when they are clearly unable to look after them and make them behave in a socially acceptable manner? It is not as if it is difficult avoid pregnancy in this day and age.", "NTA.  And anybody telling you to invite them should put their money where their mouth is - literally.  If they want them there so badly, they can take responsibility to look after all their kids, pay for anything they break or otherwise disfigure, take them outside when they get too loud, and prevent them from bullying your children. You can give them a rough figure of the damages incurred during their last visit (physical and emotional) as an example.  Then see what they have to say. \n\nEven better, stand your ground on this issue, but tell them that while it is your prerogative as to whom you invite to your house, if they are so keen on the cousins being invited, they can host the dinner and have the prerogative to invite them.

I would rethink hosting Thanksgiving dinner, while pregnant. It\u2019s not just the stress, but personal experience\u2026.the heat from preparing all the food, the aroma, the noise\u2026.it all made me sick.

Here you are required to behave.", "NTA \n\n but since you\u2019re being criticized and other people are going to be there, maybe you should allow them to come so everybody could see how unruly the kids are and unresponsive and unable to handle them their parents are.

A brood like that would scare me to death.  You are NTA.", "NTA: Lazy parenting is not your problem.", "NTA, but I can see why you're getting flack about it.  Of course no one can call you an AH for deciding who can or cannot come to your home, but some questions:\n\n1 - Have they otherwise been good houseguests? Is this new behaviour?\n\n2 - How close is the whole family? Is it glaringly apparent that one cousin is blackballed from dinner?\n\nIs the nagging worth sticking your ground or could you give it another try, talk to the cousin ahead of time and explain what happened with your daughter and you would appreciate if they had a talk with their daughter beforehand.  YOu and your husband sound like you're on the same page and maybe try for one more time to give them the chance to be better houseguests.  Sometime people have an off day.  Is it worth causing a rift in the family?", "NTA", "nta", "Have Thanksgiving at their house instead!", "Nta. Why would you set your house up to be chaotic when you know they can\u2019t control their children. So his family is saying your horrible for not inviting them. But are any of them volunteering to take a block of time to watch the kids? Or volunteering to replace and clean anything these kids damage? Probably not right. Just block his family if they want to attend that\u2019s fine if not they can host their own dinner and invite them.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't invite them either, why having kids that you can't parent? I wouldn't feel bad about it, and your husband's family can host and invite them if they want them to enjoy Thanksgiving so badly.", "NTA.  You should feel free to assign one of the children to each person getting on your back and make them responsible for what the kid does.

I'm leaning ESH.\n\nIt's two weeks before Thanksgiving. Surely this isn't the first time you've seen how her children behave. I understand she's dealing with a newborn now and that probably isn't the case, but like.. I have family members who have badly behaved kids. I would simply never invite them to my house to begin with, and not offer to host family gatherings. You volunteered your home for family, you invited them, and now you have changed your mind days before the holiday. That's not going to look good, regardless of how badly behaved and unsupervised her kids are.\n\nObviously, they're all TA for not raising their kids to be respectful of other people's homes and belongings.\n\nI definitely agree with you on not letting destructive kids come into your house, but you're in a bit of a social faux pas here, and that's not going to go over well with the family, especially not with Thanksgiving involved. \"I'd love to have you and your kids over, but I can see you've got your hands full with the little one. The older ones were running amok and causing problems at the last visit though, and I'm worried they're going to break something or get hurt. They're stressing out my pets and that's unacceptable in my house. What can we do to make sure you guys can still attend while making sure the kids are supervised?\"\n\nYou're not wrong. But this also isn't a good look, due to the Thanksgiving holiday and the timing on uninviting.", "NTA. Unacceptable behavior is unacceptable behavior and being family is irrelevant. Do the kids normally act better with other family? Unless the ones complaining have an actual solution to having them there without it being a circus, they can go to the cousin\u2019s house to celebrate with them.", "NTA - it doesn\u2019t necessarily seem as if cousin and her husband are bad people or *willingly* allowing their kids to behave this poorly. However they clearly need to get their shit together and figure out a better parenting tactic. They need a wake up call and learning that theres consequences to how their kids are acting, such as not being invited to Thanksgiving. Inviting then will just enable their enabling.", "I don't think you're an asshole but even if you were, be the asshole then or frankly say, never mind, we're not hosting.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely not TA. It's your house. Even if your husband wasn't on your side. You do not have to allow destructive people or children in your home. I have banned a few. If they say they will do better, say, show me first.", "NTA.

Offer to meet them at a restaurant or somewhere like Chuck E Cheese over the weekend. You are pregnant so you have an excuse not to want to deal with the craziness.", "NTA. Everyone who wants them to be invited is now responsible for them. If they think these children should be invited and given one last chance, great. They just volunteered themselves to be responsible for this one last chance they're insisting on. So they get to police the children and pay for any damages.

The cousin and her husband are obviously major AHs for having more children than they can handle and not parenting them. But the solution to not wanting family in your home is to not host. You have the right to not want these people in your home, but you don't have the right to decide that they are excluded from a major family holiday where other relatives will want to see them.
