{"id": 31375, "submission_id": "17zzdz6", "title": "AITA For not wanting to invite my husband's cousin, her husband, and their 5 children to our house for Thanksgiving dinner?", "selftext": "\n\n\nTwo weeks ago we invited my husband's cousin, her husband, and their 5 children (11f, 8m, 4m, 3m, 6 months old baby boy) to our house for dinner. Her 4 older kids were horrible the entire time. They broke some of my daughter's toys, got chocolate on our dining room chairs, they screamed every time they argued over things, they kept trying to terrorize my fish and bearded dragon, and the 11 year old girl was mean and told my 5 year old daughter that she looks like a boy, which she doesn't and I'm not just saying that because she's my daughter. Since then, my daughter has been asking if she looks like a boy and we don't know what else to say to reassure her that she doesn't and that she's a very beautiful girl.\n\nDuring their time here, the mom had a hard time supervising them because she had the 6 month old to breastfeed and entertain, and the dad couldn't get the boys under control because they wouldn't listen to him. The dad actually wanted to go outside and grill with my husband, but my husband kindly asked him to stay inside and help watch his kids after seeing how active and disruptive they were. Many times I offered my husband's cousin to hold and watch the baby so that she could keep an eye on her other kids, but she always refused. I'm pregnant and felt too tired to deal with her boys, but at the same time I felt like that was the parents job, and not mine. I had already spoken to the kids about how to treat animals, keeping their voices down while indoors, how to be gentle with other children's toys, but they literally didn't care. \n\nAfter they left, my husband and I agreed that they will not be invited to our house again. If we want to spend time with them, it'd be at a park or something. We're hosting Thanksgiving this year, and we're now being highly critisized by his side of the family because we are not planning on inviting his cousin and her family. They said that we should at least invite them one last time for Thanksgiving, but we don't want to deal with parents that can't keep their children under control in our house again. \n\nAre we assholes for not wanting to invite them for Thanksgiving dinner for a last time?\n\nUPDATE: I read someone's comment about us knowing beforehand how the kids behave, and that's not true. A little over two months ago, my husband received a call from his cousin, that he had not seen or heard of since they were teenagers, and she said that they've been living in our state for the past four years. No one had any idea that she was living here, much less living just an hour away from us. On that phone call she invited us to her house to meet her family and so we went to her house on a weekend. The few hours we were in her home, the kids seemed well-behaved, and none of them acted crazy. The worst they did was run around, but that's not an issue and I don't mind that at all. A few days later, my husband asked me if I was OK with him inviting them over one weekend for dinner and I agreed. During their visit in our house, we were surprised by the children's behavior and we don't understand how they could be on their best behavior in their own home, and be out of control in someone else's home. We were under the impression that they knew how to behave in other people's homes the way they do in theirs.

If they want them there so badly, they can take responsibility to look after all their kids, pay for anything they break or otherwise disfigure, take them outside when they get too loud, and prevent them from bullying your children.

Of course no one can call you an AH for deciding who can or cannot come to your home, but some questions:\n\n1 - Have they otherwise been good houseguests?

Is it glaringly apparent that one cousin is blackballed from dinner?\n\nIs the nagging worth sticking your ground or could you give it another try, talk to the cousin ahead of time and explain what happened with your daughter and you would appreciate if they had a talk with their daughter beforehand.

I'm leaning ESH.\n\nIt's two weeks before Thanksgiving. Surely this isn't the first time you've seen how her children behave. I understand she's dealing with a newborn now and that probably isn't the case, but like.. I have family members who have badly behaved kids. I would simply never invite them to my house to begin with, and not offer to host family gatherings. You volunteered your home for family, you invited them, and now you have changed your mind days before the holiday.

The older ones were running amok and causing problems at the last visit though, and I'm worried they're going to break something or get hurt. They're stressing out my pets and that's unacceptable in my house. What can we do to make sure you guys can still attend while making sure the kids are supervised?\"\n\nYou're not wrong.

However they clearly need to get their shit together and figure out a better parenting tactic. They need a wake up call and learning that theres consequences to how their kids are acting, such as not being invited to Thanksgiving.

When my family has get togethers with all the kids, we always plan some outdoor group activities just to keep things moving.

Also planning for having 5 extra kids around on your end is futile if their parents aren\u2019t going to parent them.

Depending on how it all went down, maybe you\u2019re an AH? \n\nLike if you really wanted to host and insisted when other people were willing and you included everyone but this one family, that would be AHish.  It\u2019s a family holiday.  \n\nWould everyone be there except them?", "Kinda the AH.  These people quite obviously need a break!  Your husband could have allowed the dad to be outside and grill.  And of course they got chocolate all over everything and broke toys!  The are a group of children!  And a group of children are crazy at the very best of times!  You sound super judgmental about this whole situation!  I hope your next child comes out as an absolute angel so nobody gets judgmental about your family!", "YTA. It\u2019s thanksgiving. Do you think the kids won\u2019t remember that you didn\u2019t invite them? How about buying them games and crafts to keep them busy? They need attention and hugs.", "YTA. You married into the family and are choosing to split the family during a holiday.", "YTA, you can't host a family event and part of the family you have a personal problem with out, you can either invite them or not host, those are your choices.\n\nBecause when you choose to host a FAMILY event your personal preference of family members no longer matters, by hosting a family even you are temporarily giving up *total* dominion over your house.\n\nFor the time period of the family event, you home is \"the family home\".", "[removed]", "NTA", "No.\n\nEvery Queen wants her own castle. Youre perfectly fine and within your right to say no.", "A while ago, I was at someone else house and the\nfamily have this son that was playing on the computer. Then another kid came and pushed him off the computer; he cried. No adult (and the mean kids parents) said anything. The little kid was very bratty. So I just left him up and said no. Your not playing. You\u2019re so mean. And I put the other kid back. \n\nFinally, the bratty kids father did something. He took the kid out to disciples him so it would seem he did something. \n\nThen I later learn from my cousins I was so crazy. The bratty kid came from a rich family and that\u2019s their only child lol. \n\nIt was good for the bratty kid. He was polite and after awhile, we shared the computer with that kid.", "NTA\nFeral children raised by soft parents are a plague.\nDon\u2019t let them infect your house.", "Maybe they were given candy or sodas on the way to your home? \nMy mil used to wire my kids up on candy before we would leave to drive 2 hours back home. Horrible woman knew exactly what she was doing.", "<<Since then, my daughter has been asking if she looks like a boy and we don't know what else to say to reassure her that she doesn't and that she's a very beautiful girl.>>\n\nThis sorta depends on if you Like Pink if you want to show your daughter her speech about her own daughter.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3382809918432841\n\nOr you can do what she did and create your own power point LOL\n\nPS NTA for not wanting an 11 yr old bully and mini-terrorists(re Bearded dragon/fish).

Let their kids trash his family's house, traumatize their kids, and terrorize their pets.\n\nYou hosted them already; it's someone else's turn.\n\nI'll bet she wouldn't let you hold the baby because she wanted you stuck with the hooligans.", "This is for your husband to handle. He needs to say a firm no and if anyone still gives him crap over it, then they can host that wild family.

That's a big addition to dinner.\n\nIf whoever is hosting Christmas wants to invite them, they can. \n\nBut tell whoever is pressuring you to invite them, that you'd be happy for them to host Thanksgiving and they can invite the cousins.", "NTA, if you don't want to corral children for Thanksgiving in your own house you shouldn't have to.

She used my car as her own. She let her kids eat in it and the drew in marking textas all over the leather seats and broke the DVD players in the headrests ,  \n\nShe didn't even. Tell me .\n\nThat was it I told her if she cannot control her kids then I want nothing to do with her.", "NTA. That's way too many people to have at your house for an extended period of time and with so many distractions. Their parents to will be overwhelmed again, but this time, the dad will have even more reasons to leave the mom to it. Their daughter bullied yours and she's still upset over it. Your family is free to have the whole circus over at their place if they want, bit accommodating another 7 people is way too much to expect, given that 4 of them are uncontrolled. It'll be worse with more people,  not better.", "NTA, they stressed your pets and insulted your child and they didn't apologise for it.
