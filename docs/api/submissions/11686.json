As soon as she became old enough to drink, she became pregnant and I think she\u2019s holding some resentment towards me for it. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t drink alcohol very often, I come home from work maybe twice a week and have a beer with my evening meal. She does not like this, at all. Whenever I try and become affectionate towards her with kisses, cuddling or intimacy, she pushes me away and claims the smell of the beer makes her feel sick. \n\nI think this is total BS as she\u2019s never complained about the smell before, only since she\u2019s been pregnant. She\u2019s got mad at me a couple of times for drinking but I told her she can\u2019t be mad at me for something just because she can\u2019t do it. \n\nLast night we had a fight, she ended up sleeping on the couch because she claimed our bed sheets and my clothes stank of beer.

Now I understand her hormones are all over the place and she\u2019s going to be emotional but when I say hysterically sobbing, i mean actually bawling her eyes out. I tried to convince her to join me in bed again, but she got really angry with me and told me she\u2019s sick of my drinking problem, which I definitely do not have. I only have about 4/5 beers a week max and as I said, she\u2019s only mad about it because she\u2019s still unable to drink, despite being able to legally.\n\nI don\u2019t think i\u2019m being unfair to her though, she can drink after she\u2019s given birth and besides, it\u2019s not even like she\u2019s missing out on much.

Her sense of smell has improved dramatically and the least you can do is not drink beer for a few more weeks. Or slow it down or what have you. Come on, man. She's growing a child inside of her. You should make her as comfortable as can be.", "Mate. She's got a fkn baby growing inside of her. If you can't make this sacrifice, don't have a kid. It only gets harder from here. Yta", "YTA\n\nFirst of all. She is pregnant. Her body is bombarded with an avalanche of hormones which makes her emotions go all over the place. And her sense of smell is also heigthened. While you might not be bothered by the smell of beer, she definitely is. Pregnant women are triggered by the most random of smells which usually \"normal\" people can't even smell. For example during all of my pregnancies I couldn't be in the room when my husband was cooking chicken. The smell of raw chicken made me throw up every time. Cooked chicken? No problem. Raw chicken? Vomitpallooza. And most people can't even tell what raw chicken smells like. So if your pregnant girlfriend is telling you that the smell of beer bothers her so much that she is willing to sleep on a couch, you better listen to her. While you still have a girlfriend instead of an ex-girlfriend.\n\nSecond of all. If it's such a small thing for her to not drink any alcohol for 9 months, why is it such a big issue for you? Like you said. \"It's not like she's missing out on much\" Unless you DO have a drinking problem. Giving up your alleged 4-5 beers a week in solidarity of your pregnant girlfriend in order to offer her some comfort, support and relief from something that seems to be triggering her nausea seems like something any loving boyfriend would do.\n\nGet your priorities straight. What's more important? Your beer habit or you girlfriend and baby?", "YTA", ">only since she\u2019s been pregnant \n\nomg, you mean to tell me pregnancy messes with your hormones and with your sense of smell/taste???? no way?\n\n> only 4-5 a week\n\nthat\u2019s around 20 a month, that\u2019s not necessarily normal. even negating the pregnancy, the smell of beer reeks on people.", "YTA. Twice a week is not \u2018not very often\u2019. It\u2019s often. And she\u2019s pregnant, it\u2019s very common for for particular smells to make pregnant women feel extremely sick. Not any particular smell, but alcohol, coffee, cigarettes, and meat are all very common triggers. Even if the smell of beer never bothered her before, that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s making it up. \n\nShe\u2019s having your baby and you\u2019re being an asshole to her about things she has no control over. Get your head out of your arse, apologise, and stop drinking around her.", "YTA.", "YTA. \n\nNot only has she said she doesn't like it which should be reason enough to stop you doing anything, but pregnant women's smell and taste can get really sensitive during pregnancy. What you smell as just a regular beer will be so so much stronger for her, and let's be honest beer isn't the best smelling/tasting thing at the best of times. \n\nIf you're that desperate to drink alcohol then you don't care about your girlfriend. Find a fruit juice that she likes and drinks that instead.", "YTA. At first you said\n\n>come home from work maybe twice a week and have a beer with my evening meal. \n\n2 paragraphs later it was\n\n>I only have about 4/5 beers a week max \n\nThat escalated quickly and calls into question your honesty about how much you drink. I assume lying about how much you drink is indicative of a drinking problem.\n\nAssuming you brush your teeth before bed, the only reason your bedsheets might stink of beer is that you\u2019re drinking so much the smell is coming off your skin. I\u2019ve known one or two people who smelled like that. They had drinking problems.\n\nHow do you not know that pregnant woman are often extremely sensitive to smells?

Because that\u2019s a very weird age gap if it\u2019s been going on longer than a couple of years, which I imagine it has to be if you are both having a child? Also, pregnancy affects scent receptors massively and some things never noticed before can churn the stomach (eg, my friend loved bakeries and bread but would fully throw up visiting them during pregnancy- now baby is here, things are back to how they were before but she really struggled with very specific smells!) All in all though, just can\u2019t believe this is the hill you wanna die on if you really love this woman and your unborn child- if it really is no big deal just don\u2019t drink around her for a few months, and if it is, question your relationship with alcohol (you may not be dependent but your refusal to wind down on it temporarily is questionable) and your respect for your partner during her pregnancy. At one a day, 5 beers a week is 70% of days you can\u2019t go without a beer. Even to half that would be a good compromise.", "How long is a while Sir?

Ask what she needs from you. She shouldn\u2019t have to tell you (hell, she\u2019s probably scared to since you dismiss everything she says), you should ask and listen.", "Are you her boss?", "Something doesn\u2019t add up. She got pregnant before turning 21 and you say you were together for over a year so she was a teenager, at the very least 19. But you say she was just a few months off her 20th when she got pregnant so I\u2019m wondering if she was really 18 when you started dating her. You\u2019re almost ten years older than her, no matter which way you put it this is creepy.", "Yes indeed alcohol is bad. 4/5  beers a week is not like taking a multivitamin. Alcohol puts pressure on your liver and is basically just poison that your body has to filter out.\n\nBut your responses make sense though. Sounds like you love this poison and don't like people pointing out that OP .. and by extension probably yourself have a problem.", "Go you; he can be twice TA now as you\u2019ve torn him a new one!", "$20 OP is the boss or Bartender/cook and his gf is a waitress. I'm gonna scream", "No, I\u2019m not her boss actually, funnily enough her father is MY boss, and he is absolutely fine with our relationship. Y\u2019all are making it sound like I sat outside an elementary school sniffing around literal children.", "What I do or dont love has no bearing on 4/5 beers being well within a healthy amount."]}
