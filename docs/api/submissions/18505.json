Definitely a fantasy of someone who wants to believe they\u2019re crazy skinny, but 105 at 5\u20192 is average? \n\nI\u2019m 5\u20193, dropped to 79lbs at one point due to a chronic illness (that only my mother knew about), and still never heard as much shit as OP is claiming happened to her all within one dinner. This just reads like a fantasy from someone with body dysmorphia, savage \u201csmack down comment that shut everyone up\u201d included.", "it really sounds like she's trying to make up a story where she's like actively being discriminated against for being skinny, LMFAO", "Sure it might very well be, I've gotten outside enough to hear ppl get this ruthless and funny and evil", "What is the difference between taking the high road and letting yourself be walked all over?\n  \nThis is like the little dog that sits and gets its ears and tail pulled by a small child, and sits there all nice until eventually it snaps and growls a warning to be left alone. OP took it as much as she could until the time came to snap back. And she showed she can give it back with the best and should be treated with respect. NTA", "maybe you didn\u2019t read the whole thing.. she didn\u2019t stop until i said that comment", "The GIL didn\u2019t show any sympathy so why should OP?", "\u201cGrandma in law\u201d according to OP\u2026 she also for some reason says \u201cbfs FIL\u201d which would literally mean her boyfriend\u2019s wife\u2019s dad. \n\nThis story doesn\u2019t really add up?", "grandma in law I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t in the post", "I was wondering the same thing!! I am so confused why he has in-laws and I keep asking myself like am I missing something?? Am I having a brain fart??", "Seriously why aren\u2019t more people noticing this. \ud83d\ude2d", "Same here. Look at their bio.", "So just let the GIL walk all over her? Op has to e right to defend herself was the comment a bit over the line maybe. But the GIL had already crossed that line a long time ago.", "I thought the same thing...super quick response with those exact words. OP has unchecked issues with weight. \nESH - OP was harassed by BF Gma but OP went nuclear with a twist of possessed, turn her head 360 degrees  Exorcism thrown in", "You really think GIL wouldn't have started taking the piss out of her for being sensitive? some people don't stop till you give it back.", "Nah, I'm gonna go with NTA in this situation. Let me explain, OP was perfectly fine until the last comment she made about the casket (that was absolutely ruthless & savage but may have went a tad bit too far.) Nonetheless, GIL needs to shut her piehole & have some respect for other people. Just because she's an \"elder\" doesn't give her the right to bully & mentally & emotionally abuse people. There's no logical excuse for talking to OP like that, and beating a dead horse over & over. GIL is an insecure, lazy, cow of a waste case that won't bother to help herself, so she wants to attack other people because she's bitter & jealous. As for the FIL trying to make an excuse for the GIL, saying she's an \"elder\" and can basically do whatever she want with no repercussions is also bullcrap.", "Completely disagree.\n\nNasty people SHOULD get it back, with compound interest, until they learn to behave.", "L take if you can\u2019t take the heat get out of the kitchen", "She gave it right back how she should\u2019ve. Maybe GIL can hold back the jealously so OP isn\u2019t put in such a situation where she has to defend herself.", "Completely disagree as well. \n\nCould she have been the bigger person and took the higher road? Yes. But why. She did not initiate any of the negative comments..nor retaliated initially. She kept it to herself until the comments became frequent. \n\nOP is NTA. And if she marries her BF, shes marrying this toxicity.\n\nYou don't try to appease a bully. They would just double down .", "I bet it doesn't happen again...", "i said that but you only have a limit of 3,000 characters soo \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "[removed]", "I don\u2019t know why people said she went to far. OP has every right to say nasty things back to her. Other people mention taking the high-road and ignoring it. I believe in that an extant but there\u2019s a line and the grandma crossed it.", "Seeing OPs name (associated with the whole story), I feel like she's really fatphobic and just kind of wanted to have a place to say such things\nI'm not even sure I believe her description of the GIL", "I took that to mean a grandparent-in-law.", "grandma in law sorry i thought i put that in the post \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "My guess is ~~greasy~~ grand(mother in this case) in-law.", "I believe it stands for Grandma in law", "You gonna piss off a wholeeee lotta people with these facts but I whole heartedly agree with everything you\u2019ve said. fat shaming is just as bad as skinny shaming.", "Agreed.  Someone who self admittedly has issues eating, imploring she has an eating disorder or even mental or physical issue that keep her from eating wouldn't use \"SkinnyMinnies\" and intentionally draw attention to their size.  OP seems to have a big issue with weight and would not want their size to be what defines them.", "That and the fact that this supposedly happened over thanksgiving with no explanation for why it\u2019s being brought up again 6 months later", "Lol. Hilarious!", "I did read it all. She was a massive AH. That doesn't make your comments any better.", "She also would have stopped if you had left. Do you seriously think you made the right choice? And I wouldn\u2019t be too excited about the support you\u2019ve gotten from the family. Generally the apple doesn\u2019t fall too far from the tree. If they\u2019re gonna turn on granny, they\u2019ll turn on you one day as well.", "Your boyfriend's grandmother in law would be his wife's grandmother. Either he's married and this is some sort of poly relationship, or you're confused about his relationship.", "The sub is AITA. \n\nIt's entirely possible to be a *justified* AH.\n\nBut OP is definitely the AH. Not the *only* AH, but still.", "I\u2019d agree except for the fact that she took it there. Assuming that the rest of the family is bigger based on OPs post, she made incredibly fat phobic remarks in front of fat people. It\u2019s incredibly revelatory to how she feels about fat people and honestly herself. She should get help for her food issues and watch her tongue", "But this isn't /r/Justified...OP was an AH here with those comments, even if it was justified.", "You can add more in an edit. I would add in that you tried to deescalate and ask her to stop before you went full nuclear.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Which still doesn't make sense. His grandma-in-law would be his wife's grandma. \n\nSo, is OP a side piece that his family is okay with?", "I thought it meant Girlfriend -In- Law and I was SUUUUPER CONFUSED", "So your boyfriend's GIL is your grandma? Or is it his grandma?", "Yes I agree. Shaming other people for any reason isn\u2019t nice and will result in retaliation which OP is allowed to rightfully do.", "Some people make throwaways with ironic names to the post they make.", "\ud83d\ude26 i didn't even catch that. either she's lying about this whole story, or she just needed other people to dogpile on the grandma and praise her for her body size", "Yeah that was so confusing and I\u2019m pretty comfortable with internet acronyms.", "Or his stepmother or stepfather's mother. No one says Step Grandmother in law.", "Yeah If she left it at the first comment that would have been fine", "GIL (whatever the hell a GIL is) fired the first shot. GIL just got it back tenfold. Was it harsh ? Hells yeah it was, but I've noticed that fat people always think it's fine to dump on the skinnys. The girl had been quiet the whole time, how long is she supposed to sit in silence while being told she's going to be a mess when she's older, children will ruin her and other little nasty sundry nuggets ? I'll go ESH.", "There is nothing here remotely revelatory. She was pushed and under constant barrage, so she snapped and said some regrettably hurtful comments. Assuming someone's outlook based on an angry outburst is, quite frankly, revelatory about yourself. She needs to continue standing up for herself. Gil was, in fact, who took it there and needs to watch her tongue.", "Don't get hung up on OPs fat phobic remarks. Would she have even thought of these things if it wasn't for the skinny phobic remarks against her? Probably not. She was expecting to meet her BF family members without blatant prejudice.", "Actually it\u2019s entire possible to be a justified asshole, the moderators have said that an justified asshole is NTA", "LOL", "Yah I\u2019m confused to because why would he have a FIL and GIL?", "I guessed grandma in law but i don't understand the in law part for this context.", "I\u2019ve been skinny for 20 years, and people are lying through their teeth when they claim Fat people always have something to say about skinny people. Skinny phobic is a fake thing you just made up. Being quiet works against her here.  When you\u2019re an adult, you ask people to stop when they\u2019re being mean to you instead of going straight for the jugular", "No matter how you feel, if you say something bigoted, you\u2019re a bigot. Also, there\u2019s multiple things here pointing to her prejudice.", "Does being angry with a person of color excuse racist remarks, or sexist insults when arguing with a woman?", "Nah. Those thoughts were there. The comments just helped bring them to the surface.", "Nobody comes up with casket sizes off the top. She had this locked and loaded or she thought of that later. Also both OP and GIL were prejudiced. Can\u2019t discount one over the other", "If someone initiate racist remarks and the other person retaliated in kind, why should I be mad at the recipient. Remember...both parties made weight shaming remarks. \n\nIf a weaker country dropped a bomb on yours...would you be angry if your Gov retaliated in kind."]}
