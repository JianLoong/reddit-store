I was spending Christmas with her and her fiance and his family over the holidays (I'm in college right now). She asked me to be her maid of honor that same day and I accepted happily.\n\nMy dad and stepmom were so mad when they found out I accepted. You see, my sister and I lost our mom when we were young. I was 6 and she was 9. Dad met our stepmom a year later and married her. She brought our three stepsiblings into the mix. She shared custody of her boys who were 13 and 11 while her 7 year old daughter had no dad. I love my stepmom and stepsister, my stepbrothers I don't know super well but consider them family anyway. My sister was different and she never cared. She was distant with them and favored her relationship with me. When my sister turned 18 she moved out and that Christmas when she came back, we had spent a two days in a row together. Dad told her that she would not be welcome in the home if she continued to show favoritism because she has five siblings (he and stepmom have our half brother together) and not just one, and she has a mom in the house as well who she should try to spend time with, not just him, because she had invited dad out for lunch just them. My sister was like okay, I can leave. Dad was like no, you're going to start treating them the same. She said it wouldn't happen and they have not spoken since. Dad told her it wasn't what she meant. She told him she'd never see his wife or her kids the same as she saw him, mom or me and that she wasn't going to go out of her way to spend time with people she's indifferent toward.\n\nMy stepsister has really hated not seeing her. Her brothers don't really have the same relationship with her that they have with each other and she always wanted us to make up for that since we'd share the same house all the time. But she also struggled with my sister and I having such a different relationship to the one she and I have. At the same time she wanted my sister around so she could hopefully come around to being her sister in time.\n\nSo dad has apparently lurked on my sister's FB. Saw the announcement she made about me being her maid of honor and then he let it slip around my stepsister. She was upset I was asked and she didn't get to be a bridesmaid and now my parents are angry that I accepted the role as her maid of honor, or that I would even be her bridesmaid, when they are unlikely to even be invited and since my stepsister is hurt. Dad told me it was insensitive and inconsiderate of me. He told me I should not be going along with someone who rejects our family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673448165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1096czf/aita_for_accepting_the_role_of_maid_of_honor_in/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
