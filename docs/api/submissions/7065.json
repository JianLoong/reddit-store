I was spending Christmas with her and her fiance and his family over the holidays (I'm in college right now). She asked me to be her maid of honor that same day and I accepted happily.\n\nMy dad and stepmom were so mad when they found out I accepted. You see, my sister and I lost our mom when we were young. I was 6 and she was 9. Dad met our stepmom a year later and married her. She brought our three stepsiblings into the mix. She shared custody of her boys who were 13 and 11 while her 7 year old daughter had no dad. I love my stepmom and stepsister, my stepbrothers I don't know super well but consider them family anyway. My sister was different and she never cared. She was distant with them and favored her relationship with me. When my sister turned 18 she moved out and that Christmas when she came back, we had spent a two days in a row together. Dad told her that she would not be welcome in the home if she continued to show favoritism because she has five siblings (he and stepmom have our half brother together) and not just one, and she has a mom in the house as well who she should try to spend time with, not just him, because she had invited dad out for lunch just them. My sister was like okay, I can leave. Dad was like no, you're going to start treating them the same. She said it wouldn't happen and they have not spoken since. Dad told her it wasn't what she meant. She told him she'd never see his wife or her kids the same as she saw him, mom or me and that she wasn't going to go out of her way to spend time with people she's indifferent toward.\n\nMy stepsister has really hated not seeing her. Her brothers don't really have the same relationship with her that they have with each other and she always wanted us to make up for that since we'd share the same house all the time. But she also struggled with my sister and I having such a different relationship to the one she and I have. At the same time she wanted my sister around so she could hopefully come around to being her sister in time.\n\nSo dad has apparently lurked on my sister's FB. Saw the announcement she made about me being her maid of honor and then he let it slip around my stepsister. She was upset I was asked and she didn't get to be a bridesmaid and now my parents are angry that I accepted the role as her maid of honor, or that I would even be her bridesmaid, when they are unlikely to even be invited and since my stepsister is hurt. Dad told me it was insensitive and inconsiderate of me. He told me I should not be going along with someone who rejects our family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673448165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1096czf/aita_for_accepting_the_role_of_maid_of_honor_in/", "score": 1737, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's out dating a year or less after your mom dies. Your sister was undoubtedly still grieving when dad started seeing other women. I'm not saying he should never move on but, come on, at least wait a couple of years.\n\n*\"Dad told me it was insensitive and inconsiderate of me. He told me I should not be going along with someone who rejects our family.\"* I'm kind of seeing a pattern here. Your dad put conditions on his love and ultimately rejected your sister. There was you, your mom, your dad, and your sister. Then mom passed and not too long later came in a new woman who was going to be mom. So while your sister is, as I said, almost certainly still grieving her whole world got turned upside down again and I'm guessing but I think it is a strong guess that there was a really big push to integrate the two families and your sister never bought into the new program.

There's a big difference between 6 years old and 9 years old for starters and being more amenable to integrating isn't a bad thing just as not wanting a new family isn't a bad thing.

Sister tried to maintain a relationship with the ones she cared about but dad wasn\u2019t happy with this either ( what step mom says and thinks doesn\u2019t matter) You don\u2019t owe an explanation to why you chose to attend you only siblings wedding. As for the youngest I have empathy for her she wants a relationship like you have with your sister which will never happen unfortunately. Don\u2019t let yourself be pulled into dads and step moms drama you don\u2019t speak on the wedding and spend time with the girl that\u2019s still at home. Make sure you keep that home relationship and sister\u2019s relationship separate. That\u2019s the only way you will be able to make it work. Enjoy the wedding\ud83d\ude03", "NTA. Daddy needs to learn that just because he shags some woman doesn't mean his kids have to like her or her children. They may be his family, but if your sister doesn't want them, they are not hers. You are not even a little but of an asshole for loving your sister more than your father's wife's daughter. That's normal.", "NTA. Your father is the immature controlling asshole who has ensured estrangement. He is trying to use you to punish your sister. The only asshole in this story is your father for forcing relationships on your sister that she does not want.", "NTA. Your father and stepmother sound like they\u2019re the ultimate problem.", "NTA. Ignore those assholes. I think you should follow your sister's lead and go low/no contact with your father and asshole stepmother. If they didn't try to force the issue they would have a much better relationship with your sister. They brought it on themselves.Your sister should make her FB more private and block your father.", "Ouch. Your family is broken. Girl no you go be that maid of honor. Your family issue is entitlement. Just because two human get married doesn\u2019t make an insta family. You can\u2019t make ppl do things they don\u2019t want. Sorry. Good luck with the speech", "NTA. Your dad his wife and her daughter are TA. Be your sisters maid of honor. I would definitely let your sister know he privacy settings suck and unless she likes being stalked by her dad and his family she should probably block them.", "NTA, your fine", "NTA. And it is HIM who rejected family. Your sister very well remembers/remembered your mom and she shouldn\u2019t be forced to have to call someone else mom. And bc it seems like he tried to make your stepmom a replacement (as did stepmom) THEY created this wedge. Not your sister. And to try to force you to also abandon said sister, is again, them forcing their ways on people.", "Your dad and stepmother suck. NTA", "Woah, NTA tell your Dad to back off. Your order sister has made it clear what she wanted with the relationship with ger step/half siblings and your Dad effectively told her to choose to accept them or leave ... and she left and now he's angry she got on with her life (like he did might I add( and wants her sister to be b3side her on one of the most important days if her life!! The audacity!! It's HIS problem that he told his step daughter, let him deal with the consequences. End of story", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have had to ask.\n\nI\u2019m also sorry that your stepsister is feeling left out. But every sibling relationship is different. Even before there are steps- or halves- involved. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect to have the same sibling relationship as anyone else.", "She\u2019s your SISTER. He can deal with his relationship with her but has No Right to tell you how to act in yours. Or how you should FEEL. NTA. Why do I feel this is all coming from stepmom?", "NTA- your dad needs to understand your sister is an adult and he cannot control her relationships. She gets to choose who she wants to be close to who she wants to have in her life. Whatever her reasons are they are her own and he is acting like a child by throwing down the gauntlet that she can conform or be cut out of the family. He made that decision he has to live with the consequences.", "NTA step relationships are complicated. Your sister can choose who she thinks of as family. She can also choose her wedding party. \n\nShe may have come around if the relationship hadn't been forced", "NTA. The older daughter is still grieving the loss of her mother and is refusing to bond with her new family.  Dad has to realize you can't force relationships and love between siblings. Kicking the older daughter out of the house, reduces any possibility of her interacting with the other siblings and maybe building a relationship.\n\nBride gets to choose who is in her wedding. Not everyone gets to be a bridesmaid.", "Yeah I wouldn't want to invite them either", "That\u2019s inconsistent with how you guys are treated.\n\nAnyway, NTA, you can\u2019t force that sort of thing.", "You\u2019re NTA but your sister - I know she has trauma - is kind of an AH for not considering your step sister or even younger brother. It\u2019s not really her responsibility but like, I really feel for your step sister.", "NTA. You are her sister, not her step and if you\u2019re the person she chose people should shut up and respect it. \n\nSide note, I got married this past April have two two older sisters. People in my family were peeved and confused when I chose my best friend of 20 years to be my maid of honor. I was just responded \u201cit seemed more fair than choosing only one of them\u201d fuck family sometimes, man. I hate hearing other people\u2019s opinions.", "NTA. Your dad is setting the stage to have NC with all of the children if he keeps this up. He is trying to force relationships and that will never work. It will blow up in his face and he will blame everyone else for the hell he is creating.", "Fun Fact: Your family is different from theirs. You consider your sister your family and you should tell them she is part of yours too, whether they like it or not. They can either come around and accept it or they can lose you like they lost her! \n\nNTA", "Your dad sure likes to pile on. He sounds clueless, and juvinile.\n\nNTA", ">Dad told me it was insensitive and inconsiderate of me. He told me I should not be going along with someone who rejects our family.\n\nThat's an odd stance for someone rejecting his daughter.", "Clearly, your dad can keep his opinion for himself. Sounds like you have a great relationship with your sister. Keep it this way, be her best MOH and have a blast at her wedding", "NTA. Why would your dad, stepmom, stepsister even think she would be asked to be a bridesmaid? Your dad is a major AH in all of this.", "NTA, OP. But your dad especially and your stepmom are bigtime aholes.\n\n1. Your dad is the jerk who decided to make your stepsister feel bad - on purpose!!! He told this information for no other reason than to make the hurt she now felt into a guilt stick to beat you specifically with.\n2. Both your dad and stepmom don't seem to understand that you cannot force someone to feel the way you want them to feel... and that the absolute worst way to get someone to feel a loving familial bond is to threaten the person, make ultimatums and hold other loved ones hostage.", "This is the end of the conversation.\n\nHer wedding, her choice.", "Given the parents seem to be fueling things (and intentionally shit stirring - no way dad \"accidentally\" let that slip), I'll give the step sister grace no matter what her reaction was. Especially since op doesn't live with her dad so likely can't have seen the full picture.\n\nWhich in no way means that op's sister should change the guest list.", "True, so maybe they could do it out of compassion.", "NTA your dad is awful. He\u2019s the one who has rejected his own daughter and now he wants you to do the same.", "NTA tell your sister to block them all on Facebook", "Bride\u2019s get ONE MOH. They pick their favorite human for that. You\u2019re it. What is the big deal. NTA", "NTA   You & Dad are her family.  Unless you & she decide otherwise step Mom is just your fathers wife who happens to have a kid.  Neither you or your sister chose this \"new\" family and your Dad needs the accept this.\n\nYour sister is under no obligation to accept her fathers wife and step daughter as her Mom & sister. Dad & step mom are the assholes and your sister & step sister are victims in this. \n\n\"Our family'  is no blood relation to you or your sister except for Dad. You can love people and be gratefull they raised you without having to accept them as family. You have a mother and she died and a blood sister who needs you because her father is a bully..", "NTA - Ughhh....why do parents think that just because THEY get over their prior wife or husband, that the kids should just forget that person existed and treat a new person like a replacement mother or father! It is not reality! Your father tried to force your sister to be someone and something she is not. She loves you and she loved your dad, but your sister didn't sign up for a \"new\" mother or \"new\" siblings! Your dad trying to force her to connect with his new family, instead of respecting your sister's feelings and grief, was just horrible! It placed your sister in a bad spot - either go along with treating these new family members as equals or leave. Now your father wants to control you, since he couldn't control her, and force you to not be connected to your sister all because she doesn't see his wife as a mother and the step-kids as her siblings. Your father is incredibly wrong for his behavior. You are NTA. You are now facing adulthood and you have to decide if you are going to allow yourself to be controlled or if you will put up firm boundaries with your father. If you let him \"decide\" for you who you should love and who you should care about, it will never end. Don't shut your sister out or turn down her offer because of your father. If you want to be in her wedding, then do it. If your father loves you, he will either understand or he won't. Just because a parent says something or wants you to behave in a certain way does not make it correct. Trust your heart and do what you feel is best. Don't let your dad take away your freedom to be yourself.", "NTA. Your sister gets to do what she wants, it\u2019s her wedding. It was nice you said yes! He\u2019s being a jerk (which it seems like he is a lot). \n\nBeing realistic, there probably *will* be many more uncomfortable / stressful moments to come with the wedding. Weddings can heighten lots of emotions, especially bad ones. Try to stay out of it as much as possible and don\u2019t become a messenger / in the middle. It will be hard. Good luck!", "NTA but your dad is a massive AH. Stepmom is not her mom so saying she has a new mom around is crazy and hurtful to a mourning child. She\u2019s entitled to not be as close to step siblings since they were older when they met but even if they group up together from infancy doesn\u2019t mean you are going to be close to a sibling. Your dad should be ashamed for trying to get you to separate from your sister.", "Your dad needs to be careful, he lost one daughter trying to make her love his new family. If he keeps up like this he will start doing the same to you. NTAH don't feel bad for supporting your sister on what should be the happiest day of her life so far. Be the best MOH you can be!", "NTA. Your sister is also NTA.  Your father and your stepmother should not force a relationship when your sister is truly not comfortable.", "NTA. Family members are people who we have to \u201clove\u201d but don\u2019t have to like. \n\nHeck, I have blood-relations who I don\u2019t like, and rarely or never see. Your sister can choose who she wants to love/like. Your dad is too controlling by far.", "They didn't live with us full time. They were so much closer to their dad and never cared for the blended family idea so I never got to know them very well. The same can be said for my stepsister. She was the outsider to them and not a real sister. They were like their own sibling unit within the family and not very sociable with us.", "It comes from dad just as much as our stepmom, if not more, but she's still vocal when she doesn't like something, for sure.", "It definitely doesn't work for everyone. Ours is a disaster but a friend of mine has an even bigger disaster for one. Sometimes I feel like the successful ones are the ones who go in with no expectations and help to make their kids realistic about dynamics. I don't feel like my stepmom did that with my stepsister which led to so much more hurt for her when she didn't get what she wanted.", "I already moved out. So no living with the pressure.", "My stepsister has never given up on hoping my sister would love and embrace her as another sister. She's wanted that as long as she has known us.", "I get that but I never really saw her as wrong. For her our family is me and her and our parents and that's never really changed on her part. I don't think that's the worst thing but I do understand it hurts my stepsister.", "I know, and thats totally understandable. There IS nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s just unfortunate for your younger sister who DOES feel like she\u2019s family. Though I always always wanted a relationship with my two older half siblings and they never ever showed any interest to me and I was - am - an only child. So I understand her pain. Your father is WAY out of line, it just really sucks for her. I\u2019m glad your younger step sister has you \u2764\ufe0f", "I don't know how she reacted in the moment. I was not present at the time. She does seem really hurt and let down though. After that I'm not positive. She didn't really wanna talk when I called her.", "Nope. I went to college on a scholarship. My dad isn't paying for it.", "I know. There was a whole ordeal there but I remember hearing stuff about him rejecting the idea of interacting with my stepsister and that my brothers were very aware of the fact they were not fully related.", "She was with us all the time. She was with her brothers half the time (since they were with us half of the time). But I mean, I was close to her. My sister was the one who wasn't.", "Stepsister is one year old than OP (who is an adult) and they've been family since they were 6/7. We're not talking about befriending her, they grew up together. \n\nDifferent family members have different relationships with each other, but officially everyone should be basically treated the same.", ">Different family members have different relationships with each other, but officially everyone should be basically treated the same.\n\nThis is not realistic! People, even in families, have different personalities and just because you are family does not mean you will get along with everyone else in your family! Nor should you have to. Sometimes it is best to accept that a family member is not someone you would want to be friends with and then go low or no contact. Everyone should have the freedom to decide who is \"family\" and who is not. Being \"family\" is about more than just blood."]}
