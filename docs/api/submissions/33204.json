I\u2019ve miscarried twice. I was morbidly obese and decided to have weight loss surgery. I\u2019ve lost about 100 pounds in a year. The main reason I got the surgery was because I thought that my weight was affecting my ability to carry a child. \n\nLittle Backstory: I have always wanted to be a mother. As a little girl when asked what I wanted to be when I grew up. My answer was a mother ( and a cat). I thankfully grew out of the second answer. \n\nMy sister in law (27f), Vivian, is my best friend. She is my husbands sister. She got married 6 months before us. We have a very good relationship with her and her husband. We see them 3 times a week at least! They have a son 4 who we love and adore!\n\nVivian asked if we would keep nephew while she was in the hospital. No problem, we love having him! They didn\u2019t find out what the gender the baby was so it was a surprise to all of us. Selfishly, I\u2019m hoping for it to be a boy because I want to have to first girl. \n\nWell, I woke up this morning to the \u2018It\u2019s a Girl\u2019 text and immediately started crying. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s a girl. It\u2019s that it\u2019s a healthy baby. I\u2019m happy for them and can\u2019t wait to meet baby girl. I really am but I\u2019m not looking forward to the comments that are going to be made around Christmas about when my husband and I are going to have kids. The worst part is that his family knows that I\u2019ve had miscarriages and still continue to ask and say things like \u2018don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll have a precious baby one day too\u2019 \n\nMy husband says I\u2019m NTA but I really feel like one.\n\nEdited to add: I\u2019m not bitter towards anyone. If anything I think I go out of my way to be helpful. Since they\u2019ve been in the hospital, I\u2019ve gone to their house and finished any laundry, cleaned, and prepped several meals (that I bought) that just need to be heated up when they\u2019re ready.

For what it's worth, you sound like a lovely person - you haven't let your own struggles affect your relationship with your in laws and your nephew and new niece. One thought - would it be worth your husband asking family not to make those comments to you? It sounds like they mean well and are trying to comfort you, but it's not helping. Could he ask them just to keep the comments about the new baby, and not what you're going through?", "I don't care I just wanna give you a hug.", "Definitely not the AH. I'm 33f with 1 kid I had when I was 20. My siblings are literally working on their 3rd or more kids. As for me, yes, I want another kid. My husband and I have been working on 13 years, and I have yet to have any kids together. Every time my siblings announce a pregnancy, I have all these emotions, and I start to feel less than a woman. It's completely normal to have these mixed emotions. I would suggest seeking some help mentally because, yes, this can wear you down mentally and emotionally. I was able to seek some emotional support. I still have not given up hope and still pray that my day would come. Stay strong.", "NTA. You seem to have a pretty good handle on the fact that they didn\u2019t have this baby to spite you. I  thk therapy would help you immensely to unload some of the angst and frustration but also give you tools that help you manage your emotions in these situations.  Maybe perhaps couples therapy so your husband can find tools to shore up his support. It\u2019s all in how you compartmentalize th\u00e9 emotion turmoil of wanting that for yourself and still have joy for them and the growing family. I would suggest your husband to ask his family to refrain from making comments about your having children, I mean zilch, no matter how supportive they think they may sound.", "Nta. I've been in both places: I got pregnant with our son quickly whilst friends can't get pregnant. But I also had a miscarriage and was diagnosed with secondary infertility (never conceived again) whilst my bestie had 2 babies. \n\nAllow yourself space and room for all the emotions. I told my friend who got pregnant after me: I'm so happy for you, but so sad for me. My tears are tears for joy for you, but tears of grief for me.

I hope we can have space and love for both.\n\nYou are nta and it's 100% okay to communicate what you need to other family members (not the new parents) whilst you also celebrate this wonderfull new addition. \n\nI won't tell you that you will get your miracle.

I\u2019ll try to be gentle because it\u2019s clear you\u2019re going through something but well:\n\n1. Yes obesity is a *huge* factor in infertility and massively increases the risk of miscarriage. Also idk how active you are but if you\u2019re trying to have a baby you need to be fit in order to keep up with the child once it starts moving around. If you are aware you\u2019re *morbidly* obese why did you not work on that first?

Secondly, yeah that is selfish. Also preferring one gender over another is so ridiculous.\n\n3. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s a girl.\u201d how can we believe you when 2 sentences before you said you wanted the first girl?\n\n4. \u201cIt\u2019s that it\u2019s a healthy baby.\u201d Truly this is the bit that makes you an AH. The baby is just born and you\u2019re reacting negatively to it for the sin of\u2026being born\u2026there are millions of children born every day.\n\nTheir existence doesn\u2019t take away from your hopes for parenthood or the pain of miscarrying.\n\nYou need to seek mental help in the same way you\u2019ve started physically helping yourself in order to address these feelings. The existence of your niece is not a malicious attack against you.", "NTA for feeling what you feel, but you are for being upset because you wanted the first girl!  It's not a race!  Crying because someone else had a girl is bizarre.  So I guess if you have a girl, you'll just toss her away because you can't deal with second place.\n\nIf your SIL had had two girls, would you have been hoping to have the first boy? Now, no matter what gender you get stuck with, they'll be second place. \n\nStruggling to have children is hard enough. But it seems like it's not about having children so much as it's about not winning the race. Children are not trophies. \n\nOr will you keep her and name her Silver or SecondBest or AlsoRan?  I'm not sure you're mature enough to have a child.  Maybe get a puppy. Then you can pick the gender and not be so disappointed.", "Yeah, sounds like you kinda lost your shit there. But hey, we all have our moments. Just try to be happy for them and deal with the inevitable baby questions at Christmas like a champ.", "NTA\n\nit is ok to feel this way. \n\nGet your husband to tell the family you will be staying with to please not ask that question and make comments around it.", "Oooof.

Infertility and the strong emotions that come with it, should be handled with care and consideration and I would recommend chatting with a professional, for your own wellbeing. \n\nCongratulations on losing the weight. Many will adamantly state that \u201cso many obese women have had babies so weight doesn\u2019t really matter\u201d. It actually does, and when you\u2019re doing everything you can to conceive, it makes all the sense in the world to commit to your health & give it every shot you can.\n\nI lost 12kg at the start of the IVF process and officially got down from an obese BMI to \u201coverweight\u201d but the time I conceived. \nI\u2019ve continued on and am now in a normal BMI range, it was the best thing I did for myself, regardless of whether it had any impact on my pregnancy success or not.

It's not wrong to want to have the first girl and when you heard that they had a girl, you didn't sulk, perform or treat them badly.
