Grow up.", "You literally just went to Cirque Du Solie, and you are having all your schooling paid for and expenses while you work part time for walking around money.\n\nThat is not the life of someone struggling financially.", "You\u2019re a grown adult, although you certainly sound like a petulant child.", "What\u2019s stopping you from getting YOUR life together?", "You do realize he probably couldn\u2019t \u201eget his life together\u201c because he had to work to support you while still raising you. Once you left the nest he had time to improve himself.", "You are an adult and not entitled to anything.", "This entitlement is insane.", "Honest question - what do you want him to do? Take you on vacations? Buy you new pots and pans?\n\nYou\u2019re holding a lot of resentment towards him and acting like you deserve something because he has it now and you didn\u2019t have it then. \n\nMy husband grew up relatively poor. But his younger siblings got a lot more than him because his parents were in a better place when they were growing up. He\u2019s not out there demanding an Xbox and new car because his siblings got those and he didn\u2019t.", "You\u2019re an adult now so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s responsible for taking care of you anymore. But even more than that he literally gifted you expensive show tickets so that contradicts your idea that you\u2019re getting \u2018nothing\u2019 out of him.", "You wanna know what my biological dad did for me? He beat the shit out of me and my 2 sisters. He sexually abused my 2 older sisters. I grew up in foster care. You owe your dad an apology!!!", "You're an ADULT. He doesn't need to provide luxuries for you in your 20s.", "So in 4 years he went from being destitute to being rich? That seems suspicious.", "I seriously hope he spends it all and doesn\u2019t leave you a dime. You don\u2019t deserve it. YTA", "[removed]", "Thats exactly what he can do and your not his child anymore. Just a selfish entitled grown ass adult that doesn\u2019t have a single inkling of reality. \n\nHe is not obliged to do shit. YTA", "Yea and you\u2019re grown at that. He wants you to focus on school so you\u2019re able to get a good job sooner than he was able to, he\u2019s trying to set you up for success by paying for your school ( another luxury btw) that you clearly aren\u2019t thankful for. You have really bad entitlement and resentment issues maybe you guys need to sit down and chat about it.", "He did it for himself and if his wife gets to reap those benefits good for her. I recommend therapy, you have resentment that has seeped into your relationships.", "You are no longer a child. Grow up and earn your own tickets.", "But you\u2019re not a child. Like your step mom said..Grow the f up.", "ADULT CHILD fixed it for ya. Maybe he bettered himself because he finally has time to? But this isn\u2019t about tickets, it\u2019s about your dad and you dating people that are almost the same age", "you're not a child, you're 22. grow up", "He most likely didn\u2019t have the time or energy to \u201cbetter\u201d himself when you were growing up. Once you were able to support yourself, he could put the time and energy in bettering himself. This resent you have towards him is something you need to deal with. But YTA.", "Have you ever thought that maybe his wife helped him better himself? And maybe that\u2019s why she gets to reap the benefits too?", "You're not a child. You're just acting like one.", "You\u2019re an adult. Not a child. You want VIP, pay up\n\nYTA", "He bettered himself BECAUSE of his wife. She supported his ass through school. Shame his first wife didn\u2019t do the same.\n\nYou are not a child. You are a grown ass adult. Your boyfriend is pushing 30. When are you going to stop acting like children?", "Except you are not a child. You are a grown ass woman. It's beyond embarrassing that you appear to be the last person to get the memo on that.", "If your mom is anything like you, then I can understand why there were financial issues. You seem to think your entitled to your fathers money but newsflash, your not.\n\nIf he bettered himself for his new wife its probably because she supported him and encouraged him, instead of just being take take take, like you.", "How is mom doing these days? Because dad seems to be thriving without her.", "Nope, they could definitely still be good kids after accepting the room. But offering it up is a clear sign they are grateful and appreciate their parents.", "He is the one who tells me I should only work part time to focus on school.", "OMG, right? I was given my mismatched set of pans when I was in college. They were awesome! I appreciated anything that was given to me that I didn't have to buy for myself. Bought my first \"real\" matched set when I could afford them. I gifted them to myself for my 35th birthday. Gave my son the mismatched set when he moved into his first apartment and they're still going strong! OP is totally an ungrateful brat. If she was my kid she'd be getting a roll of toilet paper for Christmas if I was feeling generous.", "OP is 22 going on 3.", "Define essentials. We had a lot of \"struggle meals\" and shopped a goodwill", "I am.in school full time and working on it, but my dad says I should only work part time to focus on finishing school", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Congrats he bettered himself. That doesn't excuse that OP had to spend their ENTIRE CHILDHOOD without things. \"Yeah, you got second hand clothes because YOUR FATHER didn't bother to get a JOB to SUPPORT HIS CHILDREN. But like get over it.\" OP's father didn't LOVE his CHILDREN ENOUGH to actually support them but he apparently loved his shiny new wife enough. I freaking hate that when you turn an adult, you're supposed to be grateful for whatever scraps of affection your parents give you, even after years of neglect.", "It is in a comment. His wife financially supported him so he could go to school.", "Again not your dads problem.", "You are an adult. You don\u2019t need dads permission to work more hours if that suits you better.", "You're 22, your dad doesn't owe you shit. Get a full-time job or tell your almost 30 year-old broke ass bf to fork up the money for tickets or stfu. YTA.", "And he would be right. Learn to make a budget \u2014 fiscal responsibility will set you up for life.", "You have to live within your means.  We all have to.  You need to get over that and work hard.  You aren't the only one that does.  You aren't entitled to anything.", "Yeah seriously. My husband and I had mismatched pots and pans in varying states of quality given to us second hand from different family memebers for most of our 20\u2019s. Only when we got married when we were 28/29 did we get a new set (and it wasn\u2019t anywhere near 2k\u2026 yikes).", "Essentials-Food, clothes, shelter. Lots of people grew up on struggle meals and second hand clothes.", "You're 22. While you've been a child shopping at thrifts and goodwill has been extremely popular. Hit songs about it and everything. \n\nStruggle meals are meals. Most families have them from time to time. But struggle meal or not - **you had meals.**\n\nYTA. If these tickets and his other gifts aren't good enough for you, decline them all moving forward and survive on your own.", "So you still got to eat everyday and had clothes? Some of us wish we were so lucky.", "Wow. Limited sympathy for you.", "Yes. They do.  So you had what you needed. You are just wanting to be spoiled now that you are gown.", "There are people who go without food at all. You still had a roof, clothes, and food whether they were up to your standards.", "Did it ever occur to you that your dad is trying to teach you the value of hard work, succeeding on your own and landing on your own two feet, without turning to him for a payout?", "And? Is that your justification? \nBe rich, like you expected your dad to be when you were a kid, then you can stop pestering for handouts. \nAnd if you can\u2019t just magically be rich, then grow the hell up and cut your dad some slack.", "Who pays for your school and rent?", "YTA. \n\nYou went from having (and being able to afford) no Cirque tickets to having free tickets. You aren\u2019t his dependent anymore, you\u2019re his adult offspring. Your father\u2019s financial situation has improved and you\u2019re resentful that you aren\u2019t reaping the luxuries. Maybe he couldn\u2019t go back to school when you were younger because he was busy fulfilling his obligation to take care of you at the time. You said that money was tight in your youth, but you still had housing, food and clothing (though, apparently not up to your entitled standards). \n\nHe met a supportive partner when he was older who supported him while he went back to school, allowing him to later provide for the two of them. That\u2019s terrific. You\u2019re in school now so you can do the same for yourself. And he bestowed you with tickets you couldn\u2019t otherwise afford after you expressed your desire to go, which is by definition, a gift. Instead of counting your blessings, you\u2019re focused on what more you can squeeze out of him and you\u2019re obsessed with comparing your gains to others. I guess if he had just kept the original tickets and gone and left you and your boyfriend at home, that would be better to you?\n\nYour bitterness is going to drive him away. And your boyfriend too, if he has any sense.", "You're 22, your dad's trying to teach you how to succeed in life by yourself and the value of real hard work. Why don't you get a job, part-time (at your dad's request) and actually stop turning to him for (financial) support. \n\nJeez woman. I'm three years younger than you and I'm ALREADY learning how to support myself while still living with my patents. I'm not in school, but I am working part-time as my mom's school as the secretary for the night school program. I don't think balancing a part-time job somewhere while being in school full-time is that hard once you figure it out. \n\nHow do I, a 19 year old woman, have more maturity and understanding of knowing what supporting myself monetarily is like better than a 22 year old? Answer me that. I'm pretty sure it's because I've grown up fast and am a lot more mature than most 19 year olds. I feel like I'm way more mature for my age than I should be, but that's a good thing.", "Did you even read OPs comments or did you just make these assumptions based on nothing? OP said her dad had a job, just not a \u2018good enough\u2019 job. And he\u2019s been able to get a \u2018better\u2019 job because his wife helped him out and he didn\u2019t have the stress of raising OP. Not really sure how that\u2019s neglect but go off", "Agreed. I bought my new fancy set at Kohls. Ended up costing me about $100 with a 30% off coupon and some Kohl's cash. I still have them 15 years later!", "Up top for Kohl's coupons!"]}
