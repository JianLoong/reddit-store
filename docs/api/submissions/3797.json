And if he decided to upgrade their seating so they could still go, that's his prerogative. By no means should you be feeling entitled to him buying you VIP tickets, nor being ungrateful for \"castoffs.\" If you're so upset, see if you can upgrade to VIP on your own dime to sit with them, or just go and enjoy the show.

If he were frugal it\u2019s a different story but to exclude your kids and splash money on a new spouse while your kids enjoyed none of the same experiences just rubs me the wrong way - similar to the other post about the dad wanting the eldest child to pay for the vacation while paying for the younger kids to go. Parents who have second families should be mindful of how they treat their first family - otherwise relationships will just fall apart because when it comes to feelings of fairness etc. It\u2019s not enough to say \u201cshe\u2019s an adult she should pay\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s an adult she should not whine and be grateful\u201d, when a child feels hurt and less favoured than the new family there\u2019s most likely many instances of being slighted/emotionally neglected and the only way one can feel \u201ccompensated\u201d at least is by enjoying the same treatment in a monetary sense.

You want them to be happy with their new person but your emotional conflict is triggering irrational feelings of jealousy and envy, feelings that you probably quash most of the time because you know that they're not 'good', not 'appropriate'.\n\nBut we are all human. \n\nAnd for even the best of us, there will be times when we will feel the loss and rejection harder than usual. And then all of those pent-up feelings that we've been holding back, they'll come rushing out in a tumult of messy, nasty misunderstood words.\n\nObviously, this could all be resolved by 'just' communicating!

It fails to recognise that many people lack the skills to do so, especially when they are in highly emotionally charged situations. \n\nThese same posters often expect people to behave perfectly in those same situations, to never slip and say the wrong thing, to never swear, to never raise their voice, to be absolutely calm and measured no matter what.\n\nThese posters can give their perfect answers, with their perspective of hindsight, not having to think on the spot, being well rested, typing with the capacity to edit and delete their words, even!

Only OP can truly know the source of their feelings.\n\nMaybe OP is just spoilt and entitled.\nMaybe OP just misses spending time with their Dad?\n\nMaybe it's both? - Given the amount of money spent, I think this is most likely, even if it's not 50/50 and just 10/90, I don't think OP's a bad person for that, I think that it can just take time to adjust.\n\nOnly OP can know but yes, the answer is for OP and their Dad to start talking to each other more.", "A bit different in your case tho is that your daughter probably also saw it as a more than fair trade; you guys paid so they could attend so she made it so that you got more bang for your buck when you were footing most of it, rather than OP who somehow feels they got the shorter end of the stick.", "I don\u2019t get the whole appreciate parents sacrifices as if that wasn\u2019t their responsibility when they made a child.", "Also maybe the only tickets left were VIP tickets.

We'll definitely look into covering an upgrade for them as well! \n\nTo clarify, when I say \"everyone\", it's admittedly a relatively small group. MIL, FIL, BIL, the hubs and I. There's a 7ish year age gap between H & BIL, so he's a fairly young adult fresh out of college and just getting on his feet. So our thought was that covering food, which will mostly be dining out (not every meal will be at a super fancy restaurant, but I'm sure some will), would be a thank you for mom and dad, and way to make sure BIL doesn't have to stress as much about budgeting for the trip and can spend what he would have put towards meals on upgrades for himself, or excursions, or whatever makes the trip better for him.", "I did think about it and applied it to this case.
