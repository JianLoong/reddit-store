Your father has not heard you, your issue is not about ungrateful but about being treated as a second class citizen. \nWhat was wrong with both couples having a less expensive seats? That\u2019s my point out that it\u2019s the wife desire that\u2019s causing the problem.  \n\nI would also try to point out to him that physical location prevents you from experiencing it as a family/ sharing the experiences.", "YTA. As far as I know, Cirque tickets tend to be pretty expensive anyway, so no matter where the seats are you got a pretty good deal... Free. If they were Dad's and wife's tickets, they would have been sitting there. Since you said you wanted to go he decided to do something nice and make it so you didn't have to pay for the experience... And if he decided to upgrade their seating so they could still go, that's his prerogative. By no means should you be feeling entitled to him buying you VIP tickets, nor being ungrateful for \"castoffs.\" If you're so upset, see if you can upgrade to VIP on your own dime to sit with them, or just go and enjoy the show. If that doesn't sound good to you, give them back the tickets and maybe they can give them to some friends/relatives who would appreciate it.", "I was sure, when opening this, that it was going to be about how he purchased tickets for you and then expected you to pay him back. If that were the case, it wouldn't be a gift.\n\nBut it was a gift. You're not expected to pay him anything for the experience. And you're upset because it wasn't as good of a gift as you would prefer? He'll think twice before gifting anything to you again. YTA", "YTA. They gave you a gift. Why so ungrateful?", "Yta. Ungrateful", "It is kinda telling that OP refers to her stepmom as \"his wife\" and not as \"my stepmom\" Like at no point does she change that in her inquiry. Clearly has problems with her stepmom as it is.\nOP, YTA.", "If I had to guess, this is the Cirque Du Soleil show going on in Atlanta currently. I went a few weeks ago and tickets were around $60 each. Not that it devalues the father\u2019s gift, just bringing in my experience lol.", "To OP: you got it for free, it\u2019s a gift. Your dad and his wife have every right to do extravagant things with *their* money. You can do extravagant things with the money *you* earn. YTA.", "YTA, OP is super entitled. \n\nIn her mind because her dad got  upgraded tickets for the wife,  he should have gotten 4 x new premium tickets....and what thrown the standard tickets away??\n\nHe didn't need to give OP those tickets, maybeit would of been best to throw those standard tickets away, OP sounds like a ungrateful child.", "That's like on the show \"the mayor\" when he says \"No, I'm rich. You're just my plus one.\" To his teenager.", "If I must. r/choosingbeggars", "Or.. You know... She can provide for herself like a normal person, cause apparently OP is 22. When I read the post I pictured a 13 year old", "They are. Cirque is an amazing, and very expensive, show. I went once, but only because my ex's parents bought tickets for us and SIL to go together.", "Op already answered that. Dad saved up for OP\u2019s tuition and they live in a house that stepmom inherited.", "Totally agree. The fact that something was expensive doesn\u2019t make it a good gift. I imagine OP wants to feel like her father cares about her enough to pick out a gift just for her, rather than giving her whatever he has that he isn\u2019t using. It\u2019s not about the tickets. It\u2019s about the thought that went into the tickets.", "Agreed - think there is way more context to the story for OP to have this reaction. Also read her comment saying they grew up poor and he only got rich later in life after marrying the new wife and only splashes money on her. If he were frugal it\u2019s a different story but to exclude your kids and splash money on a new spouse while your kids enjoyed none of the same experiences just rubs me the wrong way - similar to the other post about the dad wanting the eldest child to pay for the vacation while paying for the younger kids to go. Parents who have second families should be mindful of how they treat their first family - otherwise relationships will just fall apart because when it comes to feelings of fairness etc. It\u2019s not enough to say \u201cshe\u2019s an adult she should pay\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s an adult she should not whine and be grateful\u201d, when a child feels hurt and less favoured than the new family there\u2019s most likely many instances of being slighted/emotionally neglected and the only way one can feel \u201ccompensated\u201d at least is by enjoying the same treatment in a monetary sense. I support OP and how she feels.", "I'm sure he could have upgraded his original tickets. He probably decided to buy another set, and there were only vip seat left and the premium package wasn't much more.", "This also considers you to be entitled just because they upgrade their seats does not mean you are entitled to have the same seat. He is not neglectful he still wanted to make his daughter happy.", "Agree about the jealous attitude. And ENTITLED. Disagree about the wife thing - I don't call my dad's wife my stepmom because she was never in any sort of motherly role to me and didn't raise me.", "I've bought those tickets before.\n\nAt least pre-pandemic, buying them in advance meant getting a couple emails advertising the upgrades.  It's just as easy to upgrade your original tickets to VIP as it is to buy two more.\n\nThe main difference is that if you buy two more tickets later, the good basic seats will be sold out.  Upgrading the original tickets and buying two more regular tickets would mean OP would get nosebleed section seats.\n\nBuying two VIP tickets means he got to buy from the section set aside for late VIP purchases and give OP the early good seats he already had.", "I completely agree.....it doesn't matter why the very generous Dad and Stepmother really decided to upgrade but I'm betting they weren't happy to have two single seats apart, which may or have not been a mistake. It's possible that the one who booked them decided for  the other that that sitting apart would be ok but it wasn't. Then, they decide well, let's just get the VIP and give the singles to OP, since selling two singles requires effort, and may not happen. But so what? It doesn't make the tickets \"scraps\"! \n\nI attend theater regularly and often see those who couldn't get rid of singles on line resort to attempting to sell them outside the theater day of. It sounds like these folks would rather just give them away and generously gave them to OP, knowing they would love to go. But again, so what? The tickets are still for a show OP WANTED to attend, not bare chicken bones....\n\nOP it is entitled AF. It is not anyones business how anyone else spends their money. Also, who the fuck complains about not getting a freaking red carpet? \n\nThe wife was correct, OP DOES need to fucking grow up. I hope they found other folks to appreciate such a kind and thoughtful gift.", "#truth. They want to live BETTER than their parents and feel entitled to it, while their parents downgrade themselves.", "Kid is 22 though, so not even a teenager, which makes it worse... Hope dad can get a refund on the tickets. YTA btw!", "Do we even know for sure that OP is a teenager??\n\nEdit: OP is freaking [22](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb06c1/aita_for_telling_my_dad_his_gift_wasnt_a_gift/iyombul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You got it \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d", "Haha I love it \ud83d\ude02", "Oooof, right in the feels!

It truly speaks to a sense of entitlement that seems pervasive these days, one I can't relate to at all.", "This. Might be projecting a little, but I know how it feels to see your dad shower the new women in luxuries, vacations, and fun activities that he never would've dreamed of giving to you or your mom over and over again. It sucks. I was slightly tempted to vote N - T - A, because I could kinda see it in the way this was worded but I didn't want the firestorm.  I don't usually come to reddit and show my whole a** about it though lmao", "I traveled alone a lot when I was a kid, so I got upgraded *a lot* to business for free, esp on the long 10+ hour flights.

How can a 22 year-old have that low of an IQ level?", "In this case, the \"new woman\" provided Dad and OP with a place to live rent-free, which allowed Dad to finish school and get a better-paying job, which is why he now has enough money to spend on luxuries like these tickets.", "They\u2019d still be good kids but it was very thoughtful, self aware, and appreciative of them to do it.", "The kids did accept the room, but not for them.
