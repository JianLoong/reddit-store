It is your parents job to keep him on track.  They are putting the responsibility on you to do things he should be doing for himself. Tell them it is hampering your recovery, as you are focusing on him when you should be focusing on getting yourself healthy.\n\nWhen you get treatment for your ED, talk to your counselor about this, they will be able to help talk to your parents.", "NTA. \n\nAbandoning your job? Are they paying you?? My guess is that no, they are not... Your parents seem like absolute gems to be around! /s\n\nHe won't \"come around when he's older.\" He will just figure out new people to manipulate into doing his job. Eventually, he will burn all his bridges and be left with a resume full of skills he cannot actually perform, because everyone else was doing it for him. Which means he will not be able to hold onto any meaningful job.\n\nHe needs a kick in the pants NOW while he's still able to change direction.", "*My parents, especially mom, always told me this was just what my job was since I'm his sister.* \n\nYour parents are wrong. It is not your job, it is theirs. Keeping your brother \"on track\" requires a combination of parenting and tutoring, not sistering.\n\nWhat's more, your continuing to act in the role of parent / tutor / prison warder risks damaging your relationship with him in the years to come.\n\nI know what I'm talking about. One of my uncles was forced to act in the role of de facto parent of his sister during their teen years. She was running wild, getting into bad company, making poor choices, and he was forced by my grandmother to go out each night and search for her in all the teenage hangout places and drag her home from wherever she was.\n\nHe resented being forced to discipline someone only four years younger than he was, and she resented being told what to do by her older brother. Almost sixty years later, their relationship remains poisonous. They can barely stand to be in the same room as each other. My grandmother is long dead, but when she checked out of the parenting role and forced her son to do it, she destroyed the relationship between two of her children forever.\n\nYour parents are taking the same risk with you and your brother.\n\nEnough. Call a halt to all of it, even the tutoring. Tell them you're not doing this any more.\n\nThey probably won't accept that, so you will need to enlist the help of your teachers and counselors at school, and your treating medical professionals. Your parents should not be doing this to a teenage girl who is struggling with her own problems, and they need to have a professional tell them that in no uncertain terms.\n\nNTA. I wish you the best of luck.", "NTA, you honestly shouldn't have been doing this at all, and he's not going to make it as a uniformed peace officer if this is his attitude and work ethic.", "NTA - your parents are asking you to parent him for them. What about your grades and well being? It sounds like they are taking your work for granted, and your brother seems to feel entitled to your time and effort, and not at all appreciative of what you\u2019ve been doing for him. You should help others but only after taking care of yourself first. Is there context here with why your parents can\u2019t pick this up? Do they just think it\u2019s easy for you to do his work since you have to do your own anyway?\n\nUnrelated but he sounds like prime police officer material lol", "Wait. Its YOUR job to keep him on track? \n\nI thought parenting a child was the responsibility of the parent. That includes their academics. Your parents have failed your brother on every single level. My guess is he has a serious undiagnosed learning disability and they relied on you to pull him through the hell of it instead of getting to the bottom of WHY school was so brutally difficult for him.\n\nTell your Mom that an internet stranger who is also a Mom to a kid with a serious learning disorder and other kids without would NEVER depend on the other kids to keep him above water. That is the parent's job and if the parent can't do it then find a tutor. You \"keeping him on track\" has simply masked his learning issue and has created a really terrible situation for him.", "NTA - *My mom was absolutely furious, telling me that I can't abandon my job to keep him on track, and that he'll come around when he's older.*\n\nThis is your mom projecting.  Your job as his sister isn't to do what your mother is responsible for.  If SHE put off addressing this issue this long then she can only be upset at herself.  YOU are not your brothers parent.  Everything you said about him needing to learn this for the real world is spot on.", "NTA- you are the sibling not the parent and those roles are different. You've got more than enough going on yourself and you shouldn't be expected to parent your brother as well. Set a sibling example by taking care of yourself first and foremost.", "Anorexia nervosa is a disorder based on control, because your parents (? Mom) and twin have been controlling your life.  Definitely get help to break free and see if your folks can join in family therapy.  You are right to stop enabling your brother", "You are not the as$hole! You are doing what needed to be done along time ago! Matter fact if there is AH would be your parents bc they put you in this position!", "NTA and your parents and brother mega suck.\n\nThis is just pure unadulterated misogyny. You're twins and the same age, yet they expect the female to carry the useless male kicking and screaming across the finish line while he's hell-bent on ruining his own life.\n\nLet him.\n\nYou have enough on your plate. You're not his minder. And shame on your parents for making you a pseudo-parent. That's just straight-up abuse. Don't do anything for him. You get yourself better, you deserve it. Untreated anorexia has 20% death rate. The fact that your parents care more about your loser brother's grades than your *deadly eating disorder* shows me all I need to know about what worthless parents they are.\n\nTake care of yourself, because they're not going to. I have no doubt that your anorexia is your way of exercising control over your life, after your parents have robbed you of that control and forced you to parent your brother. They're actively ignoring how much you are literally dying for the sake of their inability to be parents to their son. They're so bad they encourage him to cheat while you waste away. I'm disgusted by them. I wouldn't spit on them if they were on fire.", "NTA \n\nYou parents definitely are. They failed to parent you guys.

Your parents need to **PARENT**", "Clear NTA - focus on you, some people have to realise the safety net isn\u2019t there to get their sh*t together (I am interested to know if it was the other way around would your brother be expected to keep you on track or is this a golden boy thing)", "NTA you're his sibling not his mom. Ed sucks hope treatment helps. Stop doing his homework.", "Huuuge NTA. \n\nThis is not your \u00ab\u00a0job\u00a0\u00bb otherwise you should get paid as a teacher or a babysitter. It\u2019s your parents responsibility to keep him on track. He\u2019s just as old as you and you have the same exams and worries about your own path, nevermind pushing someone else. \n\nWhy should you work for both of you? Why is that expected? Like how unfair. Now the one time you struggle with serious issues for you, who is there for you? Instead they just go mad and ungrateful. \n\nAlso not giving him responsibility for his actions and making others do his own work is NOT helping him grow up. You guys are almost adults. It\u2019s time for him to be able to do stuff without you, and it\u2019s time for you to feel free to do what you want and take care of YOUR problems. \n\nGood luck. I know it\u2019s your twin and you probably have a special connection, I just don\u2019t want you to end up in a situation where have to carry him around for the rest of your life just because it became granted. This is not okay.", "Nta. Your parents are tho... and shit parents to boot. Im sorry.", "NTA\n\nYOU are not his parent. What if he was an only child??", "NTA, OP, this is truly bizarre. Simply tell your brother you won't be covering for him anymore. If he wants to work in law enforcement, he needs to learn to police himself. You won't be going through the police academy for him!", "Nta. Massively. You have your own future to think about, the fact you also have an eating disorder should be something they should be addressing more than your brother slacking.

If the job needs to be outsourced\u2026it\u2019s your parents\u2019 job to keep him on track. It is not your job. If he wants to become a police officer he will need to know how to study and learn. This is the perfect time for him to learn.", "NTA. This is not your job. End of I don\u2019t need to say anymore. You\u2019re not the parent. They won\u2019t be paying you to leave your job and if you\u2019re in your final year then it will affect you too. \nParents need to step up or let your brother see how his bad grades and inability to step up will affect him.

You have enough on your plate as it is.", "NTA. your parents seem neglectful af.\n\nthis begs me to wonder if your brother has some kind of learning disability or disorder that would make him incompatible with a standard school setting. while we all know this is not always the case, your parents should\u2019ve exhausted all options before even considering recruiting you to baby him through it. charter schools, homeschool, and alternative schools all exist and could\u2019ve been valid options.", "NTA and don't let anyone else make you believe you're responsible for the actions or inactions of another person, especially those of a man.", "NTA\n\nYour brother wants to attend a police academy.

You are 100% correct that he needs to learn to be responsible for himself, and there's no better time to start than now.\n\nHe's also incredibly entitled.

Congratulations for taking the big step of telling your parents you were going to step back.  Did you tell your brother directly?  Since a big part of the problem was your parents pulling you into their parental relationship with your brother when they should not have done that, maybe part of detaching yourself from that toxic triangle will be to work at communicating directly with your brother, not through your parents.  Say that you want him to achieve his goals, but you won't be giving him any more \"help\" that he doesn't ask for.  Encourage him to talk to the guidance counsellors or study skills people at school to find healthier ways to get support - maybe a tutor? Maybe assessment for ADHD or a learning disorder?

From one anxious twin sister of a brother who used to struggle with the most bonkers things thanks to his ADHD to another - this is NOT your job. As my mom always told me and your mom should be telling you, your brother can\u2019t have you to do things for him his entire life. Most people aren\u2019t lucky enough to have a twin sister watching over them and stopping them from messing up, and they do just fine. At some point, you\u2019re not going to be able to follow your brother fixing things for him. You\u2019re not going to follow him every day of police academy, or on the job, or on every date. And what\u2019s more, you\u2019re not \u201chelping\u201d him by doing this because you\u2019re not letting him learn how to fix his own problems. You\u2019re not letting him learn to feel confident and competent and develop strategies for dealing with things, because you\u2019re swooping in and fixing things before he gets a chance. For both of your sakes, you need to learn to live without each other. Right now you\u2019re not just fixing things for him because your parents told you to, you\u2019re fixing things for him as a way of stopping yourself from getting the treatment you need because you\u2019ve decided (and your parents have helped you decide) that what he needs is more important than what you need, and if you\u2019re busy fixing things for him, that\u2019s easier and more comfortable than dealing with the things inside yourself. Even if helping your brother was your job - and I mean a real, paying, 40 hour a week job - that would not be more important than helping yourself. You can\u2019t be a helper if you\u2019re sick. You need some time off of your job right now to focus on getting better, and *that is okay.*\n\nI\u2019m going to suggest rather than asking your parents, since they\u2019ve made parenting your brother none of their business, that you ask your brother how he would feel about you going to this program or stepping back from you \u201cresponsibility\u201d. I would bet anything that he would tell you, without hesitation, that you should focus on you. It\u2019s what\u2019s best for both of you.

I'm not sure if it's a thing where you are, but police generally require a written test which compromises of reading, comprehension, spelling & grammar, math and problem solving/analytical skills. While it's not super hard (it's usually written at an 10-12th grade level), you still usually need a 60-70% to pass, with some places requiring upwards of 80%. What happens when he gets this test?

Because you stepping back means that they have the actually do their job, the one that they claim is yours. \n\nThey don't want to deal with your brother so they make it your problem.", "I hope I am not overstepping, but is the reason (or part of the reason) for your ED BECAUSE of the unbelievable requirements your parents forced on you?", "for all we know this kid could\u2019ve simply needed an IEP with accommodations and would\u2019ve been doing just fine. people will do ANYTHING to avoid exploring the idea they have a kid with a disability. \ud83d\ude44", "That too!", "OP ask yourself this one VERY important question:  What is your brother going to do when he goes to the academy?  \n\nYou WON'T be able to do ANYTHING for him.  If he's caught cheating(and that's how they'll view you doing his work for him) they will boot him and he'll have to figure something else out.\n\nYour brother HAS to learn for himself.  If he can't, he shouldn't even bother going to the academy, it would be a waste of time and resources for a slot better filled by someone ELSE.\n\nNTA.  But your brother and your parents could give lessons.  \n\nLook after yourself and good luck!!  If you can, maybe update us.  And maybe show this thread to your family(if you don't think ift will cause too much hassle).", "Honestly? \n\nTelling the counselors everything she\u2019s been doing for her brother sounds like a great idea to me!\n\nEssentially, he\u2019s been *cheating* throughout high school by forcing his sister to do all of his work for him!\n\nAnd her parents have been actively *abusing her* by encouraging it! \n\nI say drop that bombshell on the counselors, immediately before going into treatment (where she\u2019ll be safely away from her parents\u2019 retaliation).\n\nNo way is her brother graduating high school after that!", "Can confirm, having been raised by narcissists with a Golden Child brother: this is exactly what it looks like!", "No, talk to the *school* counselor first!\n\nFess up all of it, then go into treatment while the school raises hell uncovering all of her brother\u2019s cheating and her parents\u2019 abuse.\n\nOutsource the confrontation.", "If she has an eating disorder, that meltdown is already happening.", "I can't deny I was especially horrified by the detail the brother wants to be police. \n\nLike, I get having a learning disability is challenging for everyone & maybe there are career options where his way of coping (encouraged by his parents) isn't such an issue... but it basically comes down to abdicating any responsibility + outright cheating! How does he square that with the ethics of upholding the law, unless he's planning to go for the doughnut/corrupt/wife beater type of cop?", "Look, blowing it up nuclear style sounds great and all but no. Both of them will face whatever consequences the school has for cheating, although it's less likely to be serious for OP. The school also won't give the parents some kind of significant ass whooping. \n\nThen the parents find out, well sucks for OP because she's still a minor. They can withdraw consent and payment for the treatment, or if once OP comes back they can still make her life miserable over it. \n\nThis is something OP unfortunately has to be careful about if she does want help with her eating disorder or support after she finishes highschool with pursuing her degree.", "So? She *chose* to have children. It is her *job* to raise them. Not yours.", "She can talk to the counselor only as far as saying this: \"The reason my brother has been scraping by all this time? I've been doing his work for him! I know it's cheating, and I never wanted to, but my parents forced me to.\"\n\nAnd then go to the treatment facility as an inpatient, and let her parents and brother deal with the fallout."]}
