It is your parents job to keep him on track.  They are putting the responsibility on you to do things he should be doing for himself. Tell them it is hampering your recovery, as you are focusing on him when you should be focusing on getting yourself healthy.\n\nWhen you get treatment for your ED, talk to your counselor about this, they will be able to help talk to your parents.", "NTA. \n\nAbandoning your job? Are they paying you?? My guess is that no, they are not... Your parents seem like absolute gems to be around! /s\n\nHe won't \"come around when he's older.\" He will just figure out new people to manipulate into doing his job. Eventually, he will burn all his bridges and be left with a resume full of skills he cannot actually perform, because everyone else was doing it for him. Which means he will not be able to hold onto any meaningful job.\n\nHe needs a kick in the pants NOW while he's still able to change direction.", "*My parents, especially mom, always told me this was just what my job was since I'm his sister.* \n\nYour parents are wrong. It is not your job, it is theirs. Keeping your brother \"on track\" requires a combination of parenting and tutoring, not sistering.\n\nWhat's more, your continuing to act in the role of parent / tutor / prison warder risks damaging your relationship with him in the years to come.\n\nI know what I'm talking about. One of my uncles was forced to act in the role of de facto parent of his sister during their teen years. She was running wild, getting into bad company, making poor choices, and he was forced by my grandmother to go out each night and search for her in all the teenage hangout places and drag her home from wherever she was.\n\nHe resented being forced to discipline someone only four years younger than he was, and she resented being told what to do by her older brother. Almost sixty years later, their relationship remains poisonous. They can barely stand to be in the same room as each other. My grandmother is long dead, but when she checked out of the parenting role and forced her son to do it, she destroyed the relationship between two of her children forever.\n\nYour parents are taking the same risk with you and your brother.\n\nEnough. Call a halt to all of it, even the tutoring. Tell them you're not doing this any more.\n\nThey probably won't accept that, so you will need to enlist the help of your teachers and counselors at school, and your treating medical professionals. Your parents should not be doing this to a teenage girl who is struggling with her own problems, and they need to have a professional tell them that in no uncertain terms.\n\nNTA. I wish you the best of luck.", "NTA, you honestly shouldn't have been doing this at all, and he's not going to make it as a uniformed peace officer if this is his attitude and work ethic.", "NTA - your parents are asking you to parent him for them. What about your grades and well being? It sounds like they are taking your work for granted, and your brother seems to feel entitled to your time and effort, and not at all appreciative of what you\u2019ve been doing for him. You should help others but only after taking care of yourself first. Is there context here with why your parents can\u2019t pick this up? Do they just think it\u2019s easy for you to do his work since you have to do your own anyway?\n\nUnrelated but he sounds like prime police officer material lol", "Wait. Its YOUR job to keep him on track? \n\nI thought parenting a child was the responsibility of the parent. That includes their academics. Your parents have failed your brother on every single level. My guess is he has a serious undiagnosed learning disability and they relied on you to pull him through the hell of it instead of getting to the bottom of WHY school was so brutally difficult for him.\n\nTell your Mom that an internet stranger who is also a Mom to a kid with a serious learning disorder and other kids without would NEVER depend on the other kids to keep him above water. That is the parent's job and if the parent can't do it then find a tutor. You \"keeping him on track\" has simply masked his learning issue and has created a really terrible situation for him.", "NTA - *My mom was absolutely furious, telling me that I can't abandon my job to keep him on track, and that he'll come around when he's older.*\n\nThis is your mom projecting.  Your job as his sister isn't to do what your mother is responsible for.  If SHE put off addressing this issue this long then she can only be upset at herself.  YOU are not your brothers parent.  Everything you said about him needing to learn this for the real world is spot on.", "NTA- you are the sibling not the parent and those roles are different. You've got more than enough going on yourself and you shouldn't be expected to parent your brother as well. Set a sibling example by taking care of yourself first and foremost.", "Anorexia nervosa is a disorder based on control, because your parents (? Mom) and twin have been controlling your life.  Definitely get help to break free and see if your folks can join in family therapy.  You are right to stop enabling your brother", "You are not the as$hole! You are doing what needed to be done along time ago! Matter fact if there is AH would be your parents bc they put you in this position!", "NTA and your parents and brother mega suck.\n\nThis is just pure unadulterated misogyny. You're twins and the same age, yet they expect the female to carry the useless male kicking and screaming across the finish line while he's hell-bent on ruining his own life.\n\nLet him.\n\nYou have enough on your plate. You're not his minder. And shame on your parents for making you a pseudo-parent. That's just straight-up abuse. Don't do anything for him. You get yourself better, you deserve it. Untreated anorexia has 20% death rate. The fact that your parents care more about your loser brother's grades than your *deadly eating disorder* shows me all I need to know about what worthless parents they are.\n\nTake care of yourself, because they're not going to. I have no doubt that your anorexia is your way of exercising control over your life, after your parents have robbed you of that control and forced you to parent your brother. They're actively ignoring how much you are literally dying for the sake of their inability to be parents to their son. They're so bad they encourage him to cheat while you waste away. I'm disgusted by them. I wouldn't spit on them if they were on fire.", "NTA \n\nYou parents definitely are. They failed to parent you guys. For converting you into a latchkey kid when they should have been on top of your brother\u2019s schooling and for failing to protect you in the process.", "NTA. Your parents need to **PARENT**", "Clear NTA - focus on you, some people have to realise the safety net isn\u2019t there to get their sh*t together (I am interested to know if it was the other way around would your brother be expected to keep you on track or is this a golden boy thing)", "NTA you're his sibling not his mom. Ed sucks hope treatment helps. Stop doing his homework.", "Huuuge NTA. \n\nThis is not your \u00ab\u00a0job\u00a0\u00bb otherwise you should get paid as a teacher or a babysitter. It\u2019s your parents responsibility to keep him on track. He\u2019s just as old as you and you have the same exams and worries about your own path, nevermind pushing someone else. \n\nWhy should you work for both of you? Why is that expected? Like how unfair. Now the one time you struggle with serious issues for you, who is there for you? Instead they just go mad and ungrateful. \n\nAlso not giving him responsibility for his actions and making others do his own work is NOT helping him grow up. You guys are almost adults. It\u2019s time for him to be able to do stuff without you, and it\u2019s time for you to feel free to do what you want and take care of YOUR problems. \n\nGood luck. I know it\u2019s your twin and you probably have a special connection, I just don\u2019t want you to end up in a situation where have to carry him around for the rest of your life just because it became granted. This is not okay.", "Nta. Your parents are tho... and shit parents to boot. Im sorry.", "NTA\n\nYOU are not his parent. What if he was an only child??", "NTA, OP, this is truly bizarre. Simply tell your brother you won't be covering for him anymore. If he wants to work in law enforcement, he needs to learn to police himself. You won't be going through the police academy for him!", "Nta. Massively. You have your own future to think about, the fact you also have an eating disorder should be something they should be addressing more than your brother slacking.

If the job needs to be outsourced\u2026it\u2019s your parents\u2019 job to keep him on track. It is not your job. If he wants to become a police officer he will need to know how to study and learn. This is the perfect time for him to learn.", "NTA. This is not your job. End of I don\u2019t need to say anymore. You\u2019re not the parent. They won\u2019t be paying you to leave your job and if you\u2019re in your final year then it will affect you too. \nParents need to step up or let your brother see how his bad grades and inability to step up will affect him.

You have enough on your plate as it is.", "NTA. your parents seem neglectful af.\n\nthis begs me to wonder if your brother has some kind of learning disability or disorder that would make him incompatible with a standard school setting. while we all know this is not always the case, your parents should\u2019ve exhausted all options before even considering recruiting you to baby him through it. charter schools, homeschool, and alternative schools all exist and could\u2019ve been valid options.", "NTA and don't let anyone else make you believe you're responsible for the actions or inactions of another person, especially those of a man.", "NTA\n\nYour brother wants to attend a police academy.

It is not your job\u2026 ( a little louder in case you didn\u2019t hear it the first time ) NOT YOUR JOB to wrangle your brother .it is your mothers job ! She pushed him out , now it\u2019s her responsibility to raise him to be a contributing member of society \u2026", "This is not your job and should never have been put on you. Your parents have utterly failed both of you. \n\nAll of your focus should be on your ED treatment rn. And a vast majority of your parents focus should be there as well. \n\nAnd thats not even getting into how very much the person theyve allowed and raised your brother to be should absolutely not be a cop. He cant take accountability or responsibility for himself, in what universe can he be trusted to carry a lethal weapon and be responsible for an entire community?? \n\ni dont wanna play doctor or anything but as somebody who to this day struggles to just enjoy myself, eat and live when i stop to calculate how many calories are in something, i have to think that forcing you to be responsible for your brother has to have at least contributed to your ED. Cos yea its about a lot of things but a chunk of it is usually about just having something you can actually control. \n\nYou have been doing the work of two people this whole entire time and its not something that ever shouldve happened. i dont know what the laws are or how theyre interpreted but i personally would call this child abuse. \n\nIf i were in this situation i would go into the school office and just just tell them everything about all the work you did for your brother over the years and how your parents forced you to do it, said it was your job. i would do so fully knowing that it would blow up my life as well as the lives of my family. \n\nYour parents arent parenting either one of you. They are and have be failing you both regardless of whatever else they have done or gotten right.  \n\nYou need help. Help from the outside. Tell someone.", "no no no.  This is not *you*r job.  It is your *parents* job, it is your *brothers* job.  \n\nYour job is to study and work and be the best you that you can be and that isn't going to happen if you are weighed down with the responsibility of keeping your brother on track. \n\n  The best thing that would have ever happened to him is for him to have failed miserably and been told to suck it  up and study. Years ago. Not his senior year.   Maybe he has a learning disability.  Dyslexia, something going on.  Covering for him isn't helping him out. You are not his keeper and your mother is so very wrong to dump this responsibility on you.   \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou need to focus on you and your own recovery. Your parents need to find a way to have someone help him. This isn't your job.  Doing his assignments etc inflates his grades. Maybe he needs to fail on his own before others see his need for additional assistance. \n\nYou are not his parent, you are not his therapist. You are also a minor still, and you require love, attention and support, just as much as he does.\n\nYour parents are wrong -- this was never your job. It was theirs. Wishing you well, and hope things improve for you!", "You realize he could be failed out of school for you doing his assignments for him... Right? Plus how is this going to look at the police academy if he's can't do any of his own work? Are you supposed to help him with that too? This is abuse! They have no right making you do any of this and this is going to screw up your relationship with him forever, which is probably over... Plus it could screw up your own grades and future. And I don't know for sure, but if you get caught doing his work you might get failed out too. All schools are different, but it's possible. Your parents are doing a stupid thing here. It needs to stop. You are NTA", "What the \u2026????\n\nNTA. You are absolutely NOT responsible to keep him on track. For that matter, you should not have done his schoolwork either. \n\nNope. Let him fall flat on his face. Mom and Dad can let him live with them for the rest of his/their life, since they\u2019ll be supporting him anyway.", "NTA", "NTA. Haha what in the actual fuck? Your mom is delusional. My sister was an awful student & barely graduated on time as is. I wasn't the best student by any means but I passed easily. You're a better person than I am for still wanting to help him out, good on you for that. But this is in no way, shape of form your problem. I'd let it be just like if my mom told me it was my job to do so. That's just wild.", "NTA, obviously.\n\nYour parents suck.  Doing his work for him is cheating, and you are not only well within your rights to stop enabling his awful behavior, but you should.\n\nYour brother is almost an adult and has developed no life skills because your parents have enabled him and dumped all of his responsibility on your shoulders.  It's probably going to be very difficult for him to catch up, now, but it will only get worse the longer this situation is permitted to continue.  You are 100% correct that he needs to learn to be responsible for himself, and there's no better time to start than now.\n\nHe's also incredibly entitled.  He clearly doesn't respect you or value what you've done for him (complaining that you didn't do well enough on work he WOULDN'T do is batshit crazy) and that will probably spread like cancer to all of his relationships.  Your parents are entirely responsible for allowing this situation to fester, and they have set him up for failure while placing undue responsibility in your shoulders.  You've been doing the work of four people.\n\nGood luck with your treatment.  Try not to stress yourself out.", "NTA. Your brother needs to be allowed to fail on his own and face the consequences of his own inaction.", "NTA", "Prioritize you health and you\u2019ve given family notice. The pressure to manage the class work of 2 students in high school is contributing to you ED. Lack of control in your surroundings. If he has other people do his work in college that is expulsion for him and the person doing his work. Explain this stress with therapist even if it is in inpatient. Your parents will have meetings with therapist and may need to come from a 3rd party for them to actually hear how this is hurting you. \n    This second part is not your responsibility but if your brother has a learning or processing disability your parents refusal to address his issues may be masking problems he could get help to correct.", "NTA.  Not at all.  I can see how it was easy to slip further and further into this habit, and I'm sorry that your parents aren't supporting you in getting out of it.  Congratulations for taking the big step of telling your parents you were going to step back.  Did you tell your brother directly?  Since a big part of the problem was your parents pulling you into their parental relationship with your brother when they should not have done that, maybe part of detaching yourself from that toxic triangle will be to work at communicating directly with your brother, not through your parents.  Say that you want him to achieve his goals, but you won't be giving him any more \"help\" that he doesn't ask for.  Encourage him to talk to the guidance counsellors or study skills people at school to find healthier ways to get support - maybe a tutor? Maybe assessment for ADHD or a learning disorder?  But this is not your problem to solve, and I'm really impressed that you were able to see that at your age.  \n\nDo you have a counsellor yet, as part of the ED treatment or for any other reason?  I think you should let your counsellor know this key piece of information about your family dynamics/expectations, and ask them to help you figure out what to do next.", "Oh, kiddo. From one anxious twin sister of a brother who used to struggle with the most bonkers things thanks to his ADHD to another - this is NOT your job. As my mom always told me and your mom should be telling you, your brother can\u2019t have you to do things for him his entire life. Most people aren\u2019t lucky enough to have a twin sister watching over them and stopping them from messing up, and they do just fine. At some point, you\u2019re not going to be able to follow your brother fixing things for him. You\u2019re not going to follow him every day of police academy, or on the job, or on every date. And what\u2019s more, you\u2019re not \u201chelping\u201d him by doing this because you\u2019re not letting him learn how to fix his own problems. You\u2019re not letting him learn to feel confident and competent and develop strategies for dealing with things, because you\u2019re swooping in and fixing things before he gets a chance. For both of your sakes, you need to learn to live without each other. Right now you\u2019re not just fixing things for him because your parents told you to, you\u2019re fixing things for him as a way of stopping yourself from getting the treatment you need because you\u2019ve decided (and your parents have helped you decide) that what he needs is more important than what you need, and if you\u2019re busy fixing things for him, that\u2019s easier and more comfortable than dealing with the things inside yourself. Even if helping your brother was your job - and I mean a real, paying, 40 hour a week job - that would not be more important than helping yourself. You can\u2019t be a helper if you\u2019re sick. You need some time off of your job right now to focus on getting better, and *that is okay.*\n\nI\u2019m going to suggest rather than asking your parents, since they\u2019ve made parenting your brother none of their business, that you ask your brother how he would feel about you going to this program or stepping back from you \u201cresponsibility\u201d. I would bet anything that he would tell you, without hesitation, that you should focus on you. It\u2019s what\u2019s best for both of you.  Let him be your brother and give him the chance to help you with what you need instead of you always helping him what he needs. Your bond will be better because of it. You guys got this.\n\nAlso, obviously, NTA.", "You have enough to worry about without trying to keep his head above water academically.  NTAH.", "Definitely NTA stay strong girl", "NTA. You are his sister, not his mother / teacher / babysitter.", "NTA, and it's far past time you told your parents that brother needs to sink or swim on his own. No more tutoring, buddying, and certainly no more cheating for him.", "With the way things are looking right now, it would likely be a few weeks in a residential/inpatient facility, which would make it impossible for me to help keep him afloat anyway. I'm wondering if our counselors would make accommodations at that point for him?", "Seriously. I doubt he realizes how much paperwork/note taking/report filing is involved with police work. My understanding is it\u2019s like 90% of the job.", "I'm not used to standing up like this. I was always praised for being the easy child, the easy twin and sibling. I spent so long thinking it was normal until my friends began pointing it out how wrong it was, and even then it took me a long time to understand. And I can't help but feel I'm doing something wrong for stepping back and upsetting my parents because of it.", "I was thinking the same about him being prime police material, LOL!!", "You know, I had not considered the fact that he may have a learning disability, but I think that you could have hit the nail on the head with that one. Sadly, doing his work for him, rather than getting him pro help has not been in his best interests either.  They need to get guidance from the school and leave OP to herself.", "While this is definitely a contributing factor, it mainly stemmed from childhood trauma as a cause. But I do think you brought up a valid point I honestly never considered until now.", "That was my knee jerk reaction as well.", "OP, this is beyond your scope. It is your parents job to keep him on track. And you\u2019re right, the counselors are paid to aid students in their academic needs but you need to prioritize your health too dear. Your brother\u2019s academic dilemma shouldn\u2019t have been your worries to begin with.", "Your recovery and health is more important than your brother.\n\nNTA in the slightest. \n\nI saw somewhere on this sub, don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\n\nIf your parents can't prioritize your health above your brother's school, that is their failing. Not your.\n\nIt is, and has always been, their responsibility.\n\nPlead take care of yourself.", "\u2026what does he need accommodations for? Being lazy, being entitle, being a mooch? Hate to break it to you, but there\u2019s nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with your brother, he simply doesn\u2019t give af and you and your entire family have enabled him\n\nYou do realize that you\u2019ve publicly admitted to cheating, right?\n\nStop enabling him, focus on you, your parents are TA along with your brother. And tbh, a little bit of you to yourself\n\nDo you honestly think someone like him *should* be a cop? Really??", "This should have never been your job in the first place. He's not your responsibility he's the same age as you for shits sakes. Bruh don't worry about it and just take care of yourself and do what you need to do for you. He's old enough and needs to be held back if he's not ready to be an adult", "OP keep telling yourself IT IS NOT YOUR JOB. You do not get paid for this. Your mom is being contradictory and you are a teen turning into an adult not an adult throughout your childhood. You need to focus on you and not him cuz you got your own life to live cuz what\u2019s gonna happen if he fails his police academy? You\u2019re gonna get blamed and it was never your fault nor your job that he lacks ambitions.\n\nIt\u2019ll take time to get rid of the guilt that\u2019s been instilled you but honestly you need to put you as your highest priority like a lot of Redditors say don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm.", ">I'm wondering if our counselors would make accommodations at that point for him?\n\nI'd be careful going this route, they may question why he needs accommodations, specifically now and hasn't earlier which could then expose the fact you've been doing his work for him.", "Wouldn't disagree with you on that at all.", "You also have to pass written tests at the academy, it\u2019s not just physical.", "Standing up is very difficult even for most adults, let alone a 17 year old. It might be in your interests to keep them happy just because it might make your life easier. Can you pull back while still helping your brother from time to time? What are your parents doing to help him? Can they pick up some of the work?", "You wanted your parent's acknowledgement, but unfortunately for you the more you do, you became people pleasing and your parents are taking full advantage of that and \"rewarding\" you by praising you for being the easy child.  You WILL have a complete meltdown - get your mum to read what we have to say.  I am sure your parents don't want that.", "You aren\u2019t doing anything wrong. This is your parents job, not yours.

He needs to step up and do this himself. This is some gendered bullshit that parents are forcing and it is not okay.", "If he can even pass the police academy", "My dad works away, so he's gone for majority of the week. My mom works 11 hour days and honestly was never one to do the sit-down work help thing.", "It's NOT in her best interest to keep them happier.

I'm a people pleaser now because I was taught it was more important to keep other people happy and neglect myself.", "Some academies will turn you away if you're too smart. https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/robert-jordan-too-smart-to-be-a-cop", "I agree that in a perfect world it is never in her interest to do that.
