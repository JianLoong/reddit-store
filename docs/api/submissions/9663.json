Not to mention how terrible an employee you will be if you are lying about what skills you actually have or have learned. Grow up and get to work. Get a tutor or something to help YOU do YOUR work and stop taking advantage of your friend. If you can't handle the university workload, you shouldn't be in university.", "genuinely, how do you know this? if it takes her any time at all then it is taking away time she could have spent doing literally anything else that would aide her life & interests.\n\ndon't get why you would come her to ask for a judgement then fight every comment that gives you one. YTA for that alone.", "you\u2019re the one that said you feel icky and now you\u2019re trying to be defensive??? you feel icky because what you\u2019re doing is wrong. you feel defensive because its hard to take criticism. think critically about your actions and reactions.", "If you\u2019re on here asking if YTA, that says more and it is saying that you know you\u2019re taking advantage of your friend. She should be able to set that boundary, but you are her friend and friends don\u2019t make friends do their college work. Most colleges have tutoring available or professor office hours, you should be going to your professor for help to improve your writing and not having your friend do double the work just because she\u2019s an English major. Definitely a YTA", "Yes, she should. And so should you, from the other side. If somebody offered to sell you stolen goods, would you buy them just because the other person hadn't set that boundary for you? \n\nI'm beginning to think you're not so much challenged in English, but in ethics, and you really need a refresher course in that.", "If you had any ethics she wouldn't need to.", "INFO: Are you familiar with the term \u2018victim blaming\u2019?", "Since your feeling icky I assume you realize how bad the situation looks and if people in your real life were to find out about it they would probably call you out and distance themselves. You\u2019re going to lose a lot of friends and any respect they may have had for you. I would suggest stopping it now so they can think you had some remorse", "She is quite smart. Smarter than you, and you know you used her. But answer the question. Would you even be her friend if she wasn't doing your homework?", "Oh, she knows. She's just hoping you'll be her bf one day and telling herself, \"he'll change\" back off.", "Not many jobs out in the world have a lot to do with your course content. But they all require you to put in work, something you're not willing to do.", "You need those skills no matter what you do in life.", "To communicate clearly in writing.  With proper grammar.  Using your own words and getting your point across.", "Instead of cheating you could look at the comments that come back with your C grade papers and think about what you can do to get better.", "There are very few jobs with a reasonable salary that don't involve being able to write.....", "EVERY job you get is going to demand that you communicate ably on some front or another. If you cannot manage freshman/sophomore writing assingments, you are SOL in that regard. Every job also will demand that you actually be able to take accountability for your own shit. Do you think you're going to sail out of your college graduation, with subpar marks, and land behind a CEO's desk?", "I must have missed that. Start paying her.", "It's good that you're seeing why people are reacting this strongly. A lot of people struggle with this subject. But that struggle will ultimately lead to improvement if you're honest with your college about needing legitimate help.", "Then you need to stop asking her to do it. Either have someone else do it or study harder and do the work yourself. She\u2019s charging others and not you for a reason\u2026and you\u2019re even admitting that you feel wrong about it, so stop doing it.", "\"Attempted to allow her?\"  If you were serious about you'd just...pay her. Or do something equal in return to show your gratitude (take her to dinner, help her with some task) because THAT'S what friends do.  YTA, no doubt about it.", "Both parties in cheating are punished. You might be kicked out, and she might be put on academic probation", "False. If she is found to have written anything for you, her education at that institution may be over, depending on the number of strikes allowed and the mood of the Powers That Be. Both parties are punished, without exception. She wrote the papers, you turned them in under your name. This is how it goes.\n\nPunishment varies by infraction from a zero on the assignment to an F for the class to being removed from the university. If you are caught they will review all your other assignments to ascertain the extent of the cheating. Once they figure out this is a regular thing, not a one-off, they are likely to impose the maximum penalty.\n\nThis is not a laughing matter.\n\nedit: This is the same talk I gave all my students. I told them if they decide to cheat and are caught, it is out of my hands. I will be sorry for them but I will be unable to save them. The rules are clear.", "You absolute...\n\nIf she's found \"helping\" you cheat, she's in trouble, too. Gods, how did you get to college in the first place? Did you pay someone to sit your entrance exams?", "> she's only trying to help me\n\n... CHEAT!", "She doesn't \"suck\" you're making her a sucker. Good lord, no wonder you can't do your own work.", "Too bad you're cheating and if found out that can get you expelled. College doesn't fuck around.", "Are you serious right now? No one loves it that much. Trust me, I write professionally, and there is no way I want to write during all my downtime or for others' benefit. \n\nHave you considered that if you get caught--and you're feckless enough to do so--that you're endangering not only your academic career, but Emma's, as well? You can both get expelled for cheating in most universities.", "It\u2019s a big enough request that you should have insisted on paying her. It feels icky? Good.  You should feel icky when you exploit someone.", "Because she has major feelings for you and you know this. You're taking advantage of her for your own benefit.", "Truly, what evidence does she have? I don't think things would ever go south.", "...She has tried I have not understood it. I know it probably frustrates her...", "College", "They clearly want someone to tell them aww its fine. Its not fine. Its cheating. They are going to get caught and they are going to take their friend down too.", "Exactly! What a self-centered AH.", "Probably won't but ok.", "Her side gig is editing not writing essays.", "She's my friend regardless though.", "I know I should be asking for editing not rewrites. She used to do editing for me until I started asking her to help more.", "Right now almost everyone does this in the college courses I have taken. It's not uncommon. There are plenty of people that have moved on to have great lives and jobs. A few English courses wont hurt anyone.", "We were friends much before this.", "It's not like I don't do the rest of my courses. Just not english.", "Essay writing?", "I didn't mention it.", "If you can't pass on your own, and same with the other students. You do not deserve to pass at all. \n\nWhatever you are studying for you are doing a major disservice to the people you are supposed to help. \n\nShame on you.", "I do feel wrong about it..", "I have asked her to go to dinner before she's usually busy with her job. I do drive her places if she needs it because she lives close by tho", "Academic probation is reversible.", "This ^^^\n\nThis x 1000!", "Yes, but she shouldn't suck because of that. It's my fault for guilting her and asking it of her.", "She does though. she enjoys it a lot actually. She edits all the time, and for me she rewrites my stuff. She doesn't like seeing me struggle.", "Ummmm ok this is reality check time. If the university found out, her and you would most likely get kicked out. What\u2019s happening here is insanely unethical and you would both deserve to be kicked out of school.", "You have to be really dense. I'm certain there is more than just a paper trail for this, and that's all that's needed.", "Tell me you don't know how computers work without telling me you don't know how computers work.", "any messages you have ever sent her asking for help are evidence. any saved files she has of drafts and edits are evidence. you having a lack of any files of drafts and edits are also evidence.\n\nshe might not be expelled from her uni, but you would absolutely be expelled from yours. what you are doing is cheating. YTA.", "Get a tutor then", "So stop using her. This isn't rocket science.", "It\u2019s not that \u201ca few English classes\u201d would hurt someone, it\u2019s the normalization of cheating, unethical behavior, and academic fraud. It says everything about your character (and her character, and the character of your classmates) that you would engage in this and act like it\u2019s not a big deal. No employer would knowingly want to hire people who have such poor moral fiber. You\u2019re just demonstrating that you\u2019re a liability and would not be a trustworthy or reliable person with whom to be associated.", "Then stop having her do your work. Almost every comment says the same thing.", "English language skills, both spoken and written, are standard requirements for most career paths. Even STEM fields expect people who can write documentation, coherent meeting notes, etc.", "You are SO much the AH. You're taking advantage of someone that has more than \"friendly\" feelings for you. For YEARS! Do her a favor and walk away. Let her find someone that actually cares. You can buy plagiarized essays online. Even though that's wrong as well. Just walk away. Oh wait, she does it for free. Gross on you!", "Writing. Sentence structure. Vocabulary. Grammar. Critical thinking. Research. Discipline. Meeting deadlines. All important life skills.\n\nNot every class in college is related to your major or your future job. College is to give you a well rounded education, make you think, and develop skills beyond high school level.", "You're literally making excuses for taking advantage of her even though you know 100% you're wrong. Do her a favor and never talk to her again. Entitled much?!", "Yeah YTA OP. I work in a field where \u201cessay writing\u201d isn\u2019t a thing but being able to string 2 words together professionally is pretty major.

Really?\n\nYou are a terrible friend.\n\nPlagiarism, cheating, taking advantage of someone\u2019s [unreciprocated] feelings for you while saying you\u2019re their friend, and then being dismissive of the severity of the consequences for it? \n\nSo much ick here.", "But it is a severe punishment that might impact her ability to be employed. It's not as bad as getting kicked out of college but if you need her to write your papers anyway you aren't actually learning what you profess to have learned and don't deserve a degree.", "Because together you are committing fraud. She is just as guilty of that as you are.", "We don't go to the same school. She shouldn't have to be kicked out when other people are using her.", "I don't think it will happen....", "She would never do that to me.", "I used to work as a university tutor. Tutoring services are usually free", "I have one.", "She only edits. She doesn't write anyone else's essays but mine. And yes. It is because I have put a little bit of pressure on her.", "It's not fraud. It's just unethical, she's writing essays not committing tax fraud, it's not illegal in any way.", "That\u2019s not how it works. She is actively involved in cheating. She is writing others people\u2019s assignments, she has a business set up. She would absolutely get kicked out and be punished most severely. This is really messed up omfg.

If they know she's doing this for students at another school, they will notify that school.\n\nGo Google \"college cheating scandals.\" You really don't seem to understand how serious this is. You will both get expelled. Additionally, if this comes out even years after you get your degree, the university can revoke your degree. Google that. I've seen it happen before.\n\nYou asked what proof she had of your wrong doing? She has your first draft and then the final copy that she writes for you! That's the proof.", "She could choose not to do this, either for you or for those who pay her. She deserves punishment for cheating just as much as you do.

You could get expelled from your course for this.", "You're correct that it's not tax fraud. Are you aware there are other types of fraud?", "The definition of fraud is lying for material gain. You are lying for the purpose of gaining a college degree you don't deserve (an item of considerable economic value), and you are therefore defrauding the university of their degree, by compelling them to give it, unknowingly, to one who does not meet their standards. She's helping you do all this, and so she is also committing fraud.\n\nESH. Stop it.", "Fraud is a noun with several definitions, one of which is the criminal meaning.
