My dad (the focus here, so I'm not even gonna touch the bonfire that is my mom) would visit me a few times a week, spend a few hours, and always said he wasn't there yet, but soon he would. I just had to wait a little more. He was like a fun relative that would play with me, and give me presents on special days, but never be there when I needed a dad not a friend.\n\nSomething important to add is that my dad always asked me to call him by his name, not dad. He used to say best friends call each other by name (now I kinda understand he was young and just wasn't ready), so \"Adam\".\n\nWhen I was 15 \"Adam\" stopped having roommates and talked to me about moving in with him and being together. At this point, I was mad about everything so I told him no. He respected my wishes but started spending more than a few hours a week with me. When I moved out for college the distance kinda got in the way and we stopped talking as much as we were in my last years of hs. \n\nThen, when I was around 18/19 Adam met my future stepmom, and in one of my visits home, he introduced us. She already had kids from a previous marriage, they were very young. We quickly got along, and she became a bridge to \"Adam\", I would talk to her about how much I wanted this to work but everything that was holding me back, and she helped him to improve into being the person I needed.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm already back from college and live by myself. I was at their house Sunday at lunch, and my step-sister (8f) came to the kitchen and said \"I need a dress, dad\", and hearing this just broke something in me. I didn't want to cause a scene or have this fight in front of my step-siblings, so I just said I forgot I had something to do and had to leave right now. \n\nWhen \"Adam\" called me asking what happened I just couldn't hold myself and broke down. I told him he didn't care about me if he didn't allow me to be the first person to call him dad, and that I hated him for deciding not in mine, but in someone else's childhood, that he was ready to go dress shopping, and helping in her every day, but for me, he just wasn't there yet.\n\nWe haven't spoken since, but my grandparents called me and said I was an AH for still holding over his head something he did when he was so young, and now I had broken his heart saying all of this, but he changed and I should not have done that, AITA?", "created_utc": 1670932425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zktwam/aita_for_storming_out_after_my_stepsister_called/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has your step mom talked to him about this issue?\n\nYou need therapy, as does your father.", "Nta....he never once acknowledged your feelings....and the 1st thing to do was for him to ask you to call him dad....but remember anyone can be a dad..it takes a man to be a father...has he been a father?", "Please get yourself to therapy OP, this is so beyond AITA paygrade.\n\nYou have a load of unmet needs and wishes, and you need to be able to express them in  a safe environment and be able to process them. \n\nAdam was way too young when he had you, he truly had no idea how t be a parent. And for whatever reason, you guys didn't circle around to the discussion about calling him dad.  Your grandparents raised you, but you always had a 'dad' shaped hole in your heart. Go get therapy, help heal yourself.\n\nOur parents are sometimes not what we need them to be, and that's their shortcoming. We should not keep being hurt because of that", "You are absolutely not the asshole for having these feelings.\n\nYes he was a kid too. But when you were seven he would have been what, 21?\n\nI know of many early 20\u2019s folks who got married and had kids. It is still young, but at the very least he could have let you call him Dad and been a bit more then a buddy. It sounds like his parents enabled him in some ways, but it is hard to know.\n\nHe was young, but you were a child, a baby. Even after 10 years he still couldn\u2019t get it together and you are allowed to be hurt and upset about that now. He should be able to hear and accept your big feelings without running and hiding behind his own parents again. It sounds like he still needs hand holding to do the right thing if his partner is the one doing the work to make him be a real parent to you.\n\nI am sorry, you deserve so much better then what he is giving you. I hope you have support and a therapist yourself to help process all of this and validate you.", "NTA, at all\n\nYour feelings are very valid, and you walking away in order to not make a scene in front of your stepsister was a mature way to deal with it. \n\nYour grandparents were wrong calling it a \"grudge\", you have every right to feel like this and I hope you and \"Adam\" can talk this out, and meet your needs.", "NTA here.  He is the one who did the damage and if he is truly earnest, he is the one who needs to reach out and do the hard work of mending the relationship.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine how you must have felt.", "NTA\n\nYour feelings are very real. This \"man\" had you call him by his name his whole life and you (a child at the time) respected his wishes believing this was normal between father and child formed within a somewhat distant relationship.\n\nSeeing another child (8... poor girl) call him dad \"broke\" something in you. That break was the realization that this person is not a father to you and had no desire to be all these years. MAYBE a somewhat distant participant... but not a father.\n\nRealizing you don't have a dad is heartbreaking... that desire for safety and love is strong no matter who you are. \n\nMy father was non-existent my whole life until I was 25. I had my own family at that time and was going through college. I didn't trust this man but at the same time I still wanted to know my blood and who/what this relationship could possibly be. Things felt ok until I realized he was just calling all his donation children to see who would take him in while the broke up with his girlfriend at the time. The guy was a bum. But for some reason it still broke my heart. \n\nSo now, as an adult, you are realizing something for the first time... maybe you longed for something you thought would be possible or felt somewhat optimistic... but now it hurts to realize this man didn't want to be your father this whole time.", "NTA.. just because he changed, doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen and it doesn\u2019t mean you have no right to feel this way. Fuck that.", "NTA, Congratulations on holding it together and not scaring your little step-sister.\n\nI read the OP as you are not mad at step-sis. You aren't even mad at dad about what she said. You are mad, disappointed and hurt at dad about the way he has treated you all of your life and her comment just reminded you of that.\n\nAbout \"something he did when he was so young\" This abandonment is something that he is still doing.\n\nThe thing that he did when young was get a girl pregnant and abandon her and the child (you). The emotional abandonment of the child is an on-going thing. I'm a \"the past is the past, move on\" kind of guy, but this isn't past, it's present.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry. Let him be heartbroken. He failed you and has realized now. How he acts now will show you how much he cares for you. Hope you are in therapy.", "NTA. This was a hard read and I feel for you. You're absolutely not an AH for holding him accountable for his actions. Your grandparents are wrong, in my view. Why does his broken heart matter but yours never seemed to?\n\nI don't think Adam deserves to be called your dad, I really don't.", "NTA. He told you to wait your whole life and you\u2019re still waiting, but he never made them wait. \n\nI\u2019m sorry he wasn\u2019t a good dad. That isn\u2019t your fault.", "NAH (except guilt tripping grandparents). Your step sister is not wrong to see him as dad or call him that. It\u2019s unfortunate that you were born in a time where he wasn\u2019t cut out to be a dad (what 14 year old would be?), but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t get the chance to grow up and be a dad now that he is ready. It\u2019s a net positive that that little girl has a positive father figure in her life, but it\u2019s understandable to be hurt that he couldn\u2019t be that for you first\n\nYour jealously and hurt feelings are understandable. I\u2019ve never read a scenario more suited to family therapy. You both need healing", "I'm going with NTA, but trying to go easy on your dad.\n\nSo first, you're definitely not TA in this situation - you feel the way you feel, and for very good reason. While specific incident is minor (and you kept your composure until a better time to express yourself), the issue is life-long and needs to come out.\n\nYour dad is kind of an AH, but it sounds like he can still redeem himself. I will cut him slack for his failures when he was younger, and from your description it sounds like he's made a lot of progress. That he's finally taking on the role of \"Dad\" with his stepdaughter is not a bad thing - the bad thing is that he never took on that role with you. \n\nIt's probably good if your comments \"broke his heart\" - it means he knows you're right and is embarrassed and upset with himself because it's true. He really needs to step up (and do it soon) to apologize to you sincerely and start to be the person he should have been in your life. It won't change the past, but it could help going forward.", "NTA\n\nYour father is still refusing to accept you as his daughter and now he does exactly that for a kid form his new wive?\nHe seems to not view you as his daughter but still as \"the thing that came from a mistake back then when he was young\".\n\nAnd about the heartbreak your GP are crying about:\nIs he really not able to accept the truth about this situation? Does he and your GP really need to rely on you ability to ignore the hundreds of heartbreaks he caused so they do not face their own shame?\n\nI am sorry but the amount of disregard, ignorance and selfrightousness these people are showing really rubbs me the wrong way.", "NTA. Part of his growth is to own the consequences of his actions, yes even of the mistakes he made as a teenager. In this case, not having been there for you as a father was a choice he made all the way up to his 30s. He now has to own that, and own the feelings of abandonment that it created in you, his daughter that he chose to not raise. It\u2019s a tragic situation, because he was still a child when you were born. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that your feelings don\u2019t matter. You are both entitled to have feelings, and both need to be treated with compassion. Maybe reach out and ask him to go to some family therapy sessions with you, to help facilitate getting through this challenging part of the relationship which is acceptance of each other for who you are.", "NAH - You\u2019re right to feel cheated, hurt and bitter about this. You were robbed of the parents you should have had and that\u2019s your right. \n\nI do however see that he was growing up too. Should he have been? No. But he was. And it seems he has changed. And part of growing up is not repeating the same mistakes. While you see that \u201cDad\u201d moment as a blow to you, he likely sees it as a corrective experience in his parenthood journey. \n\nEither way, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this OP. Wishing you healing on this difficult path.", "NTA, maybe N A H, except your grandparents. \n\n**Why in the *world* would they put the onus on you? They should be talking to your father.** \n\nMaybe he didn't realize the effect this would have, maybe he did, but how can it at ALL be *your* fault? \n\nBig hugs to you. You did an amazingly selfless & adult thing by not taking this frustration out on others. You didn't even \"take it out\" on your father, you were just honest with them. He needs to step up right now, and set his feelings aside. He needs to listen to what you've said & actually *hear* you. I hope he can do this.", "NTA yes he was just a child when you were born, an incredibly young child. But he should have taken you in as soon as he left education. \nAnd to expect you to just accept that he's now ready to be a dad, just not to you. Is just heartless. \nI'm so sorry how they've let you down. I hope he find it in himself to fix this", "I\u2019m so sorry your dad couldn\u2019t be your dad for you, NTA.  And no one else in your family could really step up to be that person?  What about your heart broken a thousand times over in your childhood?", "NAH, but your grandparents kinda are. They are guilt tripping you for very valid feelings. Its very sad that your dad couldn't be there for you when you were younger. But to repair that relationship he needs to see your feelings or at least you need to express them to somebody. Maybe a family therapy might help. \n\nSometimes the storm is needed so all family members are aware of each others feelings, here mainly your dad about yours. \n\nConflict is not necessarily a bad thing, it might be a chance to get together and for your dad to really see how you are and to keep working on the relationship.", "NAH - You're heartbroken, he's heartbroken. Good on you for not sharing the heartbreak with the kiddo.", "NTA. This is so sad. Neither one of you are AHs, but I expect your Dad to do better, he's been an adult for awhile now.  I'm sure you love your Grandparents, I know they love their son, but guilt tripping you is a dick move. You may find talking to a professional will help you navigate thru this, someone unbiased in the situation and with only your best interests in mind. If it's validation for how you feel you need, you have it.", "I want to start by saying that I completely understand why you are upset and I do not think you are an asshole, I'm sorry that you are hurting over this. Your feelings are valid, it's normal and totally okay to feel bitter about this. You are doing incredibly well all things considered, a lot of kids who's parents had them young end up going down very dark paths and I'm glad that you haven't, you should be proud of the person you've become.  \nI'm going to say NAH, only because I don't believe your dad did anything with the intent to hurt you and he had no control over what your step-sister said at that moment. Your dad was young when you were born but he isn't now, he still might not know how to sit down and have a conversation with an adult and tell them he's ready to be called dad now, he may assume that isn't something you would've wanted given that you told him at 15 you didn't want to live with him. From everything you've said I really do think there's been a lot of assumptions made and not enough communication happening. I'd recommend sitting down with your dad and telling him how you really feel and asking him to do the same.  \nIf anything your grandparents are being assholes for calling you an asshole and expecting you to just get over 23 years of feeling like you didn't have a proper dad.   \nI also think that your dad is asshole for not stepping up a lot sooner to be the dad you needed, but in this exact situation I don't believe him to be the AH if that makes sense?  \n\n\nI hope you talk to your dad and sort all this out and he steps up and is a real dad to you from now on... even though you're grown.", "NTA- this seems to have been not well handled by the adults in the situation as well as your father when he was an adult. By my calculations he was nearly 30 when he asked you to move in but still hadn't suggested or said he was ok with you calling him father. That's not good of him imo.", "mmm this is complicated and I feel for you my dad left when I was young and moved states. I know he cared for me but... it was his affairs family that got to have a dad not mine. And that is hard not to take personal.   \n\n\nHe has perhaps changed but your feelings are valid. Your grandparents getting involved and blaming you for valid emotions is wrong. Unfortunately neither you nor him can make the past not exist.   \nDo you want to call him dad? Do you want that relationship now that your older?   \nYou guys should sit down and have a heart to heart I think talk it out. He was wrong no doubt but understandably so. It sounds like he is trying to be a good father now and his new children shouldn't suffer for the mistakes of the past. I think you guys need to talk and maybe even go to a family therapy session if that doesn't fully work", "Nta\n\nYour grandparents are the reason why Adam felt so comfortable being a deadbeat, they enabled him to the expense of you. \n\nDon't listen to them, they made their priorities clear and it's not your safety or mental wellbeing. \n\nI'm sorry you had that childhood.", "I\u2019m so sorry OP! You\u2019re definitely NTA and all those feelings are completely valid and understandable! Yes he was young and made mistakes, but it seems he never really spoke with your, even as adults, on how all this effected you. You were his responsibility (& your mom\u2019s) and they both failed you, even if he tried a little more than she did. Please look into some counseling for yourself if you haven\u2019t already!! I hope this relationship with Adam can be mended if that\u2019s what you want. Hugs!", "NAH - i just think this whole situation is extremely upsetting. You\u2019re 1000% nta for being mad at your dad but i feel deep empathy for the whole situation. I can\u2019t imagine what its like to be the child of such young parents but i also can\u2019t imagine what its like to be such a young parent and the inadequacy you and your dad must feel. I definitely think your dad should have spoke to you about it before letting/hearing your step sibling call him dad, but i feel like it wasn\u2019t malicious and more an insecurity problem. I hope you guys sort it out and maybe go to family therapy. I think with the effort he has continuously put in with you you mean a whole lot to him, he just might not feel adequate enough to ever be called your \u2018dad\u2019 and that\u2019s something you should discuss", "NAH\n\nIf you're not already talking to a therapist, I'd highly recommend it.  You've got a lot of thoughts and feelings coming out because of this and it could be overwhelming.", "NAH he was child when he had you. Not your fault but he was a child. \n\nHe made an attempt when he was an actual full grown adult. You weren\u2019t ready again not your fault.
