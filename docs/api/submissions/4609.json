On account of their age, my parents weren't ready to fully take care of me. In the end, it was decided I would stay with F and grandparents, he moved out after graduation but I stayed so he could get through his feet and take me in later. (I don\u2019t remember any of this, obviously, but that's the story I\u2019m told)\n\nAs you can imagine, I waited my whole childhood for him to be ready. My dad (the focus here, so I'm not even gonna touch the bonfire that is my mom) would visit me a few times a week, spend a few hours, and always said he wasn't there yet, but soon he would. I just had to wait a little more. He was like a fun relative that would play with me, and give me presents on special days, but never be there when I needed a dad not a friend.\n\nSomething important to add is that my dad always asked me to call him by his name, not dad. He used to say best friends call each other by name (now I kinda understand he was young and just wasn't ready), so \"Adam\".\n\nWhen I was 15 \"Adam\" stopped having roommates and talked to me about moving in with him and being together. At this point, I was mad about everything so I told him no. He respected my wishes but started spending more than a few hours a week with me. When I moved out for college the distance kinda got in the way and we stopped talking as much as we were in my last years of hs. \n\nThen, when I was around 18/19 Adam met my future stepmom, and in one of my visits home, he introduced us. She already had kids from a previous marriage, they were very young. We quickly got along, and she became a bridge to \"Adam\", I would talk to her about how much I wanted this to work but everything that was holding me back, and she helped him to improve into being the person I needed.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm already back from college and live by myself. I was at their house Sunday at lunch, and my step-sister (8f) came to the kitchen and said \"I need a dress, dad\", and hearing this just broke something in me. I didn't want to cause a scene or have this fight in front of my step-siblings, so I just said I forgot I had something to do and had to leave right now. \n\nWhen \"Adam\" called me asking what happened I just couldn't hold myself and broke down. I told him he didn't care about me if he didn't allow me to be the first person to call him dad, and that I hated him for deciding not in mine, but in someone else's childhood, that he was ready to go dress shopping, and helping in her every day, but for me, he just wasn't there yet.\n\nWe haven't spoken since, but my grandparents called me and said I was an AH for still holding over his head something he did when he was so young, and now I had broken his heart saying all of this, but he changed and I should not have done that, AITA?", "created_utc": 1670932425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zktwam/aita_for_storming_out_after_my_stepsister_called/", "score": 1973, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has your step mom talked to him about this issue?\n\nYou need therapy, as does your father.", "Nta....he never once acknowledged your feelings....and the 1st thing to do was for him to ask you to call him dad....but remember anyone can be a dad..it takes a man to be a father...has he been a father?", "Please get yourself to therapy OP, this is so beyond AITA paygrade.\n\nYou have a load of unmet needs and wishes, and you need to be able to express them in  a safe environment and be able to process them. \n\nAdam was way too young when he had you, he truly had no idea how t be a parent.

We should not keep being hurt because of that", "Edit to add NTA!\n\nYou are absolutely not the asshole for having these feelings.\n\nYes he was a kid too. But when you were seven he would have been what, 21?\n\nI know of many early 20\u2019s folks who got married and had kids. It is still young, but at the very least he could have let you call him Dad and been a bit more then a buddy. It sounds like his parents enabled him in some ways, but it is hard to know.\n\nHe was young, but you were a child, a baby. Even after 10 years he still couldn\u2019t get it together and you are allowed to be hurt and upset about that now. He should be able to hear and accept your big feelings without running and hiding behind his own parents again. It sounds like he still needs hand holding to do the right thing if his partner is the one doing the work to make him be a real parent to you.\n\nI am sorry, you deserve so much better then what he is giving you. I hope you have support and a therapist yourself to help process all of this and validate you.", "NTA, at all\n\nYour feelings are very valid, and you walking away in order to not make a scene in front of your stepsister was a mature way to deal with it. \n\nYour grandparents were wrong calling it a \"grudge\", you have every right to feel like this and I hope you and \"Adam\" can talk this out, and meet your needs.", "NTA here.  He is the one who did the damage and if he is truly earnest, he is the one who needs to reach out and do the hard work of mending the relationship.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine how you must have felt.", "NTA\n\nYour feelings are very real. This \"man\" had you call him by his name his whole life and you (a child at the time) respected his wishes believing this was normal between father and child formed within a somewhat distant relationship.\n\nSeeing another child (8... poor girl) call him dad \"broke\" something in you. That break was the realization that this person is not a father to you and had no desire to be all these years. MAYBE a somewhat distant participant... but not a father.\n\nRealizing you don't have a dad is heartbreaking... that desire for safety and love is strong no matter who you are. \n\nMy father was non-existent my whole life until I was 25. I had my own family at that time and was going through college. I didn't trust this man but at the same time I still wanted to know my blood and who/what this relationship could possibly be. Things felt ok until I realized he was just calling all his donation children to see who would take him in while the broke up with his girlfriend at the time. The guy was a bum. But for some reason it still broke my heart. \n\nSo now, as an adult, you are realizing something for the first time... maybe you longed for something you thought would be possible or felt somewhat optimistic... but now it hurts to realize this man didn't want to be your father this whole time.", "NTA.. just because he changed, doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen and it doesn\u2019t mean you have no right to feel this way. Fuck that.", "NTA, Congratulations on holding it together and not scaring your little step-sister.\n\nI read the OP as you are not mad at step-sis. You aren't even mad at dad about what she said. You are mad, disappointed and hurt at dad about the way he has treated you all of your life and her comment just reminded you of that.\n\nAbout \"something he did when he was so young\" This abandonment is something that he is still doing.\n\nThe thing that he did when young was get a girl pregnant and abandon her and the child (you). The emotional abandonment of the child is an on-going thing. I'm a \"the past is the past, move on\" kind of guy, but this isn't past, it's present.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry. Let him be heartbroken. He failed you and has realized now. How he acts now will show you how much he cares for you. Hope you are in therapy.", "NTA. This was a hard read and I feel for you. You're absolutely not an AH for holding him accountable for his actions. Your grandparents are wrong, in my view. Why does his broken heart matter but yours never seemed to?\n\nI don't think Adam deserves to be called your dad, I really don't.", "NTA. He told you to wait your whole life and you\u2019re still waiting, but he never made them wait. \n\nI\u2019m sorry he wasn\u2019t a good dad. That isn\u2019t your fault.", "NAH (except guilt tripping grandparents). Your step sister is not wrong to see him as dad or call him that. It\u2019s unfortunate that you were born in a time where he wasn\u2019t cut out to be a dad (what 14 year old would be?), but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t get the chance to grow up and be a dad now that he is ready. It\u2019s a net positive that that little girl has a positive father figure in her life, but it\u2019s understandable to be hurt that he couldn\u2019t be that for you first\n\nYour jealously and hurt feelings are understandable. I\u2019ve never read a scenario more suited to family therapy. You both need healing", "I'm going with NTA, but trying to go easy on your dad.\n\nSo first, you're definitely not TA in this situation - you feel the way you feel, and for very good reason. While specific incident is minor (and you kept your composure until a better time to express yourself), the issue is life-long and needs to come out.\n\nYour dad is kind of an AH, but it sounds like he can still redeem himself. I will cut him slack for his failures when he was younger, and from your description it sounds like he's made a lot of progress. That he's finally taking on the role of \"Dad\" with his stepdaughter is not a bad thing - the bad thing is that he never took on that role with you. \n\nIt's probably good if your comments \"broke his heart\" - it means he knows you're right and is embarrassed and upset with himself because it's true. He really needs to step up (and do it soon) to apologize to you sincerely and start to be the person he should have been in your life. It won't change the past, but it could help going forward.", "NTA\n\nYour father is still refusing to accept you as his daughter and now he does exactly that for a kid form his new wive?\nHe seems to not view you as his daughter but still as \"the thing that came from a mistake back then when he was young\".\n\nAnd about the heartbreak your GP are crying about:\nIs he really not able to accept the truth about this situation? Does he and your GP really need to rely on you ability to ignore the hundreds of heartbreaks he caused so they do not face their own shame?\n\nI am sorry but the amount of disregard, ignorance and selfrightousness these people are showing really rubbs me the wrong way.", "NTA. Part of his growth is to own the consequences of his actions, yes even of the mistakes he made as a teenager. In this case, not having been there for you as a father was a choice he made all the way up to his 30s. He now has to own that, and own the feelings of abandonment that it created in you, his daughter that he chose to not raise. It\u2019s a tragic situation, because he was still a child when you were born. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that your feelings don\u2019t matter. You are both entitled to have feelings, and both need to be treated with compassion. Maybe reach out and ask him to go to some family therapy sessions with you, to help facilitate getting through this challenging part of the relationship which is acceptance of each other for who you are.", "NAH - You\u2019re right to feel cheated, hurt and bitter about this. You were robbed of the parents you should have had and that\u2019s your right. \n\nI do however see that he was growing up too. Should he have been? No. But he was. And it seems he has changed. And part of growing up is not repeating the same mistakes. While you see that \u201cDad\u201d moment as a blow to you, he likely sees it as a corrective experience in his parenthood journey. \n\nEither way, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this OP. Wishing you healing on this difficult path.", "NTA, maybe N A H, except your grandparents. \n\n**Why in the *world* would they put the onus on you? They should be talking to your father.** \n\nMaybe he didn't realize the effect this would have, maybe he did, but how can it at ALL be *your* fault? \n\nBig hugs to you. You did an amazingly selfless & adult thing by not taking this frustration out on others. You didn't even \"take it out\" on your father, you were just honest with them. He needs to step up right now, and set his feelings aside. He needs to listen to what you've said & actually *hear* you. I hope he can do this.", "NTA yes he was just a child when you were born, an incredibly young child. But he should have taken you in as soon as he left education. \nAnd to expect you to just accept that he's now ready to be a dad, just not to you. Is just heartless. \nI'm so sorry how they've let you down. I hope he find it in himself to fix this", "I\u2019m so sorry your dad couldn\u2019t be your dad for you, NTA.  And no one else in your family could really step up to be that person?  What about your heart broken a thousand times over in your childhood?", "NAH, but your grandparents kinda are. They are guilt tripping you for very valid feelings. Its very sad that your dad couldn't be there for you when you were younger. But to repair that relationship he needs to see your feelings or at least you need to express them to somebody. Maybe a family therapy might help. \n\nSometimes the storm is needed so all family members are aware of each others feelings, here mainly your dad about yours. \n\nConflict is not necessarily a bad thing, it might be a chance to get together and for your dad to really see how you are and to keep working on the relationship.", "NAH - You're heartbroken, he's heartbroken. Good on you for not sharing the heartbreak with the kiddo.", "NTA. This is so sad. Neither one of you are AHs, but I expect your Dad to do better, he's been an adult for awhile now.  I'm sure you love your Grandparents, I know they love their son, but guilt tripping you is a dick move. You may find talking to a professional will help you navigate thru this, someone unbiased in the situation and with only your best interests in mind. If it's validation for how you feel you need, you have it.", "I want to start by saying that I completely understand why you are upset and I do not think you are an asshole, I'm sorry that you are hurting over this. Your feelings are valid, it's normal and totally okay to feel bitter about this. You are doing incredibly well all things considered, a lot of kids who's parents had them young end up going down very dark paths and I'm glad that you haven't, you should be proud of the person you've become.  \nI'm going to say NAH, only because I don't believe your dad did anything with the intent to hurt you and he had no control over what your step-sister said at that moment. Your dad was young when you were born but he isn't now, he still might not know how to sit down and have a conversation with an adult and tell them he's ready to be called dad now, he may assume that isn't something you would've wanted given that you told him at 15 you didn't want to live with him. From everything you've said I really do think there's been a lot of assumptions made and not enough communication happening. I'd recommend sitting down with your dad and telling him how you really feel and asking him to do the same.  \nIf anything your grandparents are being assholes for calling you an asshole and expecting you to just get over 23 years of feeling like you didn't have a proper dad.   \nI also think that your dad is asshole for not stepping up a lot sooner to be the dad you needed, but in this exact situation I don't believe him to be the AH if that makes sense?  \n\n\nI hope you talk to your dad and sort all this out and he steps up and is a real dad to you from now on... even though you're grown.", "NTA- this seems to have been not well handled by the adults in the situation as well as your father when he was an adult. By my calculations he was nearly 30 when he asked you to move in but still hadn't suggested or said he was ok with you calling him father. That's not good of him imo.", "mmm this is complicated and I feel for you my dad left when I was young and moved states. I know he cared for me but... it was his affairs family that got to have a dad not mine. And that is hard not to take personal.   \n\n\nHe has perhaps changed but your feelings are valid. Your grandparents getting involved and blaming you for valid emotions is wrong. Unfortunately neither you nor him can make the past not exist.   \nDo you want to call him dad? Do you want that relationship now that your older?   \nYou guys should sit down and have a heart to heart I think talk it out. He was wrong no doubt but understandably so. It sounds like he is trying to be a good father now and his new children shouldn't suffer for the mistakes of the past. I think you guys need to talk and maybe even go to a family therapy session if that doesn't fully work", "Nta\n\nYour grandparents are the reason why Adam felt so comfortable being a deadbeat, they enabled him to the expense of you. \n\nDon't listen to them, they made their priorities clear and it's not your safety or mental wellbeing. \n\nI'm sorry you had that childhood.", "I\u2019m so sorry OP! You\u2019re definitely NTA and all those feelings are completely valid and understandable! Yes he was young and made mistakes, but it seems he never really spoke with your, even as adults, on how all this effected you. You were his responsibility (& your mom\u2019s) and they both failed you, even if he tried a little more than she did. Please look into some counseling for yourself if you haven\u2019t already!! I hope this relationship with Adam can be mended if that\u2019s what you want. Hugs!", "NAH - i just think this whole situation is extremely upsetting. You\u2019re 1000% nta for being mad at your dad but i feel deep empathy for the whole situation. I can\u2019t imagine what its like to be the child of such young parents but i also can\u2019t imagine what its like to be such a young parent and the inadequacy you and your dad must feel. I definitely think your dad should have spoke to you about it before letting/hearing your step sibling call him dad, but i feel like it wasn\u2019t malicious and more an insecurity problem. I hope you guys sort it out and maybe go to family therapy. I think with the effort he has continuously put in with you you mean a whole lot to him, he just might not feel adequate enough to ever be called your \u2018dad\u2019 and that\u2019s something you should discuss", "NAH\n\nIf you're not already talking to a therapist, I'd highly recommend it.  You've got a lot of thoughts and feelings coming out because of this and it could be overwhelming.", "NAH he was child when he had you. Not your fault but he was a child. \n\nHe made an attempt when he was an actual full grown adult. You weren\u2019t ready again not your fault.

Having a child in your teens is difficult to handle at that age and he made some mistakes along the way, I'm sure. Now that he knows how you feel I'd wait until he contcts you and then have a frank and honest discussion with him. Remember that he was a very young father and wouldn't have had a clue what was expected of him..not excusing his behavior but he was a kid himself when he asked you to call him Adam.", "As I tell my 4 year old, you\u2019re allowed to feel your feelings. You\u2019re allowed to be upset.  It\u2019s not like you called \u201cAdam\u201d and unloaded this on him, he *did* ask.  I can see how all of that would be incredibly difficult to hear for him.  I can see how this interaction would be incredibly difficult to witness for you.\n\nI absolutely agree with other Redditors that this is above AITA pay grade and that you should seek professional therapy to work through these complex emotions.  As a mom, it is very important to me that you recognize that the flaw in the equation was NOT you, it was your father.  \n\nI can imagine the mental burden.  One of my ex boyfriends was raised by an alcoholic mother until his bio father got custody of him at 13.  His dad wasn\u2019t great either. I recall in specific his 21st birthday, where we sat at home all night waiting for his dad to call because dad had said he was going to take him out to dinner. Dad finally called at 8pm with the excuse that there\u2019s been a fire and he couldn\u2019t get past the fire hose so he\u2019d been unable to go to the bank\u2026because ATMs don\u2019t exist? Dad has nobody to borrow $20 from? His son would have been happy ordering off the $1 menu at McDonald\u2019s.  As an adult, this event infuriates me.  \n\nFwiw, I also do not think that your father is in the wrong.  A 4year old is going to naturally seek that paternal relationship and is going to be willing to call a father figure \u201cdad\u201d much faster than a 19 year old will, especially a 19 year old with such a complicated past with their father.  After 4 years, at 8, I am not surprised that the stepdaughter refers to her father figure as \u201cdad\u201d.  I would imagine that now at 23, you are still quite a ways off in being ready to call your father \u201cdad\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear that you never get there. I can\u2019t imagine I would be able to, even with therapy.", "NTA.", "NTA- how dare they try to dictate how you feel.

Your dad should have never asked you to call him by his name and not dad. Also, sure.. he is trying now to be better, but that does not negate all the years of pain and hardship you went through while he figured his shit out. Your grandparents are not your parents. They had to raise you, but that doesn't make up for the fact that your bio parents didn't rise to the occasion. You have a lot to be angry for, and your dad and hopefully, eventually, your bio mom gets the earful they deserve.

If you are one, then for the sake of this post and my reply, I would have to say you share that trait 50/50 with your dad. I think there are multiple universes colliding here that are all combining very chaotically. It has caused even my own thoughts to be chaotic. So I will try to share them;\n\nYOU (OP)\n1. There is nothing at all wrong, or invalid, about your feelings at that moment. I\u2019m sure it probably caused some deeply repressed hurt and confusion to suddenly surface, if that was the first time it registered to you that your stepsister sees your dad, as well, her dad.\n\n2. The fact you got upset and immediately left when your stepsister spoke and said dad tells me you still have a lot of deep buried resentment for your dad. I\u2019ll address your dad later on but for now let\u2019s talk about you. Have you ever sought professional help to be your source for discussion, venting, understanding your feelings, and just an overall voice of empathy for you? Individual family counselors have really come along way in helping individuals sort through life events like what you have been through. I would suggest at least try it. There\u2019s nothing lost if you decide it\u2019s not for you. A perfect launching point is this very post. Share it with them and see where it goes. \n\n3. Do you ever spend one on one time with stepsister? Given her age, and the life events, and change going on around her she is probably very confused and has no way in her mind to sort out who all the characters are in this new life that she neither picked nor had any say so in it happening (sound familiar?). She\u2019s 8 years old and sees figures in her world; a mom, a father figure (the same person that goes in moms room every night when we go to sleep), and another sister type figure that comes over. Yes, I will say the obligation rest with you as the adult to help her understand where you two fit in all this as it relates to your relationship with her. Think about doing something specific and use it as a tool to just talk tell her you wanted to just see how she\u2019s doing and then let her talk. You might find that simply being there for someone in a confusing time in life will end up helping you as much as her. May I suggest this; reach out to your step mom and ask her if it would be ok for you to take your stepsister to get the dress she was asking for. I am certain she will already know why your asking and will probably be overwhelmed with joy. \n\nDAD (ADAM)\n1. Your dad is a universe all to his own. Your mom as well, but that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here today. When you were born your dad was still a child. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. I was once a 14 year old boy and I was all boy in my mind. His physical body may have been different but intellectually he was a boy. To put this logically, when he and your mom got close there was a consequence that neither could fully appreciate due to their lack of intellectual maturity. This is obvious because family recognized this and immediately stepped in to protect you, and them to an extent. The negative side of this is there was little to no consequence to him for gathering a child. It sounds like he didn\u2019t have to work to support you. To provide food, shelter, clothing, extras, that role was taken on by others. It would be way to long to write what I think your dad is dealing with. I will say that there is nothing he can do to erase from his mind the events surrounding your birth. It seems as though he never was taught skills to cope with it. \n\nAs he got older, he learned that the only skill he had was to be a friend. The parental role was filled. Here is the magnification of more confusion in his mind, and yours. What is he, dad, friend? Both? Probably exacerbated by the fact he was still trying to become an adult and establish his life, career, find a significant other. Eventually, he woke up one day and he was an actual adult. And the baby he created was approaching teens and puberty. I assure you by now, rather he admits or not, some level of shame and guilt started to creep in. It doesn\u2019t sound like the two of you are good at open deep communication. Fast forward to new wife. He probably saw this as a chance at redemption. He remembers he screwed up (quite literally) and maybe his heart is telling him don\u2019t screw up again with step sister. Combined, possibly, with her young desperation for a father this created a perfect storm. Have you ever had deep discussion with your dad? If you\u2019re not up to it and are satisfied with where your relationship is with him then ok. But if you think it has a lot of room for growth then consider asking him if he\u2019s open to conversations. Ask him if he\u2019s open to going to a few counseling sessions with you. At the end of the day all you can control is your behavior and reactions to day to day family life. He is what he is and he is, an imperfect human being, and now old enough that he is not going to change. His past is what it is and until he forgives himself, and until you can forgive the resentment in your heart, it\u2019s going to always linger in the background like a tornado ready to roll in. \n\nSTEPSISTER \n1. She is the only one in this that I give a complete free pass to. She is just a kid who has no knowledge of the past. She only knows the dynamics of the small world she lives in. On a much broader scale she knows mom, the man mom says is now dad, and siblings. She knows if she feels loved or not by each. That\u2019s all her mind can compute, as it should be. Take advantage of that in a positive way and use it to help build a relationship to her. You don\u2019t really have to explain all the dynamics of that day to her. You can just tell her you were in a sad or emotional state and that it wasn\u2019t because of her. That\u2019s still the truth, technically. \n\nSUMMARY\nWork on getting yourself to a place of acceptance and forgiveness to everyone involved. First for your heart, and then if appropriate others. Don\u2019t be afraid to seek professional help to assist in getting a baseline understanding of everything. Ask dad if he\u2019s willing to attend a few with you. If he says no, that\u2019s ok. Again, all you control is your responses to situations, not the other people. Take your stepsister to pick out a dress if they\u2019re ok with that. Again, if they say no, ok. Try something else another day. All you can do is work to become the best version of you. Stop holding on to your mom and dad\u2019s screw ups from the past and let that be on them to work out. I wish you well.", "The expression that comes to my mind, crude as it is, is \"Shit or get off the pot\".\n\nI'm sure Op's father and grandparents had good intentions at the beginning, I'm sure it sounded like the best solution for everyone involved when he was 14 and OP was an infant to have the grandparents take care of the baby temporarily. \n\nBut by the time OP was old enough to miss having a dad in her life, someone should have sat \"Adam\" down and told him he needed to make a choice, either be her dad, take on that role and prioritize it even if he wasn't ready to take full custody quite yet (since he would have been 17-18) or admit he wasn't going to be ready any time soon and have the grandparents adopt her.\n\nThey might not have intended it to be, but it was cruel to dangle the possibility of \"He'll be your dad when he's ready\" in front of OP like that for her whole childhood.

Her dad was just too young to raise a kid at 14, and wouldn\u2019t realistically have been ready until his mid 20s without getting stuck in the poverty trap. Knowing that, his grandparents should probably have acknowledged that he was her dad, but not tried to talk up him as a custodial parent to her.

It is trying to the best of your ability to be a parent. From where I'm standing, OP's dad neglected OP for years, expected her to move in when he was ready (he would have been 28 at the time) and just kind of expected OP to wait for him.

Yeah, he might have been young and unable to parent her but he grew up and continued not to parent her.

When you have a child it\u2019s your responsibility to care and give love to be your child. But he didn\u2019t do that instead he made his own kid feel like shit and gave them trauma.

As long as he has insurance, he can get family therapy for the two of you.", "Therapy, support groups, family counseling... pretty much anything would be a step in the right direction. Depending where you live, there may be free or low cost services. It's worth checking out.

When something hurts this bad and for this long we tend to think the person hurting us \"has to\" know what they are doing, but likely (from his reaction) he doesn't.

If so it\u2019s totally possible to find a therapist who isn\u2019t super expensive. Usually bigger practices don\u2019t charge as out of network (I\u2019m talking about in the US, idk where you\u2019re from so this may not be helpful). I did intake stuff at a bigger office a couple years back and was matched with a therapist that seemed like a good fit. They had several in mind, but their first choice was great, I still see her and even have an appointment later! Her hourly rate is $70, but since their office charges insurance directly I only have to pay the co-pay which is $30. Psychology today or whatever the website is can be helpful. The psychiatrist I see is out of network though and that\u2019s hella expensive, dealing with filing for reimbursement is not a good time. I have to see her though for my autism/adhd/cptsd and meds though since her being a specialist makes a huge difference in the care I receive. I don\u2019t do talk therapy with her, only with the one who is much less expensive.\n\nYou may also be able to find someone who charges based on what you can afford, I had a therapist who did that even though she was out of network as well!", "This is it. The father was still a kid for so long after she was born. I'd guess that the initial arrangement was a panic response to \"what do we do now?\" without thinking ahead five or seven or ten years. I suspect everyone was doing their best and the situation just sucks. \n\nI can even guess that as her father matured from a stupid 14 year old, that he would have doubted his worthiness to suddenly being The Dad after 7 or 10 years of being a kid who doesn't have his act together. Good chance he got wrapped up in that feeling and lost sight of his daughter's feelings.\n\nI can't imagine having to navigate this relationship in any of the roles. That's where therapists can help. \n\nOP your feelings are totally valid and understandable. I do hope that you seek some therapy (would make sense for grandparents or dad to pay) and find your way through this. And I hope you do it together with your dad and his wife.", "When her father became an adult OP was 4. He didn't care enought to get his sh*t together until she was a teenager. If he was really \"doing his best\" he would have spent more then a couple hours a week with them and gotten himself into a living situation where he could take care of his child before he was 30. OP just wasn't a priority.", "Your grandparents are not great or they would not be trying to manipulate you into taking responsibility for your dad's feelings while simultaneously dismissing yours. It is not your responsibility to protect Adam or his feelings, that was his job to you, and he failed. And your grandparents failed.", "I can't agree; your grandparents took physical care for you, but they never built into you the knowledge that your father's issues were that: his issues. Not yours, and not your responsibility. From all you've said, you grew up with the feeling that somehow this was your fault; it never was, and never will be. \n\nI'd recommend finding some therapy. I know it can be expensive, but look around your area for free or low cost resources for survivors of abuse and neglect, try youtube channels (look at the provider's creds, too), journal; beat hell out of a basketball on a court if that helps you channel the anger and hurt into something useful to you. \n\nYou're owning your feelings now and your father may be forced to acknowledge the free pass he's been given for so long. Both can be good things, and despite the difficulty you're currently experiencing, I think you're going to be good in the end. With, or without him.", "Oh for fuck's sake. That isn't any kind of apology. It's a denial of responsibility and accountability. \n\nIf he wants a relationship with you, he needs to address what you said, make a sincere apology, and do the damn work to build one.", "Do not give him a pass on that nonapology. I suggest writing down your thoughts and feelings as it may be easier to communicate them that way. Stick to I feel statements and then if you feel ready give them to him or read them to him. I am so sorry you experienced that. He wanted his time to experience youth and doesn\u2019t realize how that was at your expense.", "OP,  your father owes you a TRUE apology.  Not the bullshit he offered on the phone. A real apology contains several concrete steps:\n\n>1. Say you\u2019re sorry. This is where remorse is demonstrated and is the first thing an apology should contain.\n\n>2. Take responsibility. No excuses or blame shifting. (Those invalidate the apology.)\n\n>3. Name it. This is where the offender states what they did. Naming their behavior makes it real, and is very difficult - even for adults.\n\n>4. Ask for forgiveness.\n\n>5. Make restitution. This isn\u2019t always applicable, but usually there is something. Your father should ask you what he can do to make it right. Then he needs to follow through and do it.\n\n>6. Commit to do better. His apology can only be validated over time through his changed behavior. A true apology should include a commitment to not repeat the behavior.", "That seems like a good first step! You guys communicated something that apparently was not yet clear to him, and he apologized and listened.\n\nHe really was way too young to be a parent at 14, and by the time he was ready, you were at an age where people are often pretty rejecting of their parents. He may have believed that he had stepped up too late and that you would always want distance. \n\nHopefully, he will follow this up after he has had time to think about it and open a conversation about what you need going forward. This seems like a situation where you both could possibly heal a great deal--IF he steps up now instead of stepping back. I hope for both of you that he does!\n\nYour grandparents are wrong here. It's inevitable that you would have these feelings, especially given that they encouraged you to expect things from him that he wasn't ready to give, when it should've been obvious to them that was not in your best interest. It wasn't in his, either. You expressing these feelings was vital for you and your dad to make progress (and you did it at an appropriate time, which showed excellent restraint and compassion for step-sis). The solution here is not you forgetting the ways that the adults in your life have failed you; the solution is for your dad to work to repair his relationship with you. You aren't holding a mistake from decades ago over his head; you are upset that he still hasn't finished stepping up for you.\n\nOne more thing: you told him that you hated him, but your post doesn't make it seem like that's actually true. It seems like you feel very hurt (understandably) and that you were very blindsided to see him playing the role of father, and you were lashing out. If you don't hate him, it might be worth setting the record straight and trying to explain that you love him but feel very rejected. I hope he's old enough now to be able to read between the lines and know that, but making sure it's clear won't hurt and is good practice at communicating clearly!\n\nNTA.", "Having a kid at 14 is the kind of thing that fucks you up for life.\n\nThis whole situation is a tragedy.", "Your father's insurance will pay for family therapy.", "Do you still call him by his name?
