I would tell her to kick rocks", "NTA you have every right to say no.

If it\u2019s evolved, as friendships do, think about what you want. Do you want to keep her as a good friend? If so, go and host despite her not going to yours. Maybe you want to keep her as a distant friend? Just talk to her, tell her you aren\u2019t in a position to play this role in the way she\u2019s expecting but that you can try to attend.
