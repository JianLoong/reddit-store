She loves stereotyping Asians (and Black, Brown, and Indigenous people, for that matter) and gets upset when I don\u2019t play along. She has told me that I shouldn\u2019t work so much because my place in life is to serve my husband. She even once took me to a town after telling me \u201cit\u2019s a cute racist town that you won\u2019t feel comfortable in.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, I have confronted her about what she says and I\u2019ve tried to educate her, but every time she says that I don\u2019t know her intentions and I shouldn\u2019t be so sensitive.\n\nSo this year, we hosted our annual holiday at our home. I got super sick the day before they were going to drive here, so we suggested that they come here a day later.

I cooked for them their whole visit, and no one offered to help or said thanks once.\n\nWhen opening their gifts, my MIL and FIL said \u201cThank you (insert name of partner here)\u201d twice and never thanked me once.\n\nThen to top it off, they gifted me jelly beans, honey, and grains as my Xmas gifts. I don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful, but this happens every year. Everyone gets gifts that they enjoy/want and I\u2019m given random food items with TJ Maxx clearance price tags still on them.\n\nAfter they left, I told my partner that I do not want to spend any more holidays with his family because his family treats me very poorly and I don\u2019t like being treated like the help. He didn\u2019t take this well and said I wasn\u2019t being fair towards his family.

You deserve better", "Can\u2019t your husband protect him?", "Hey, I could easily be wrong on that one. But unfortunately, it is not uncommon for interracial relationships to involve some degree of fetishization. And unfortunately for asian women, submissiveness is often the stereotype. I\u2019m also really quite surprised that your husband isn\u2019t noticing that you\u2019ve been getting a box of Francis Coppola brand radiatore pasta and a jar of seafood seasoning blend for Christmas gifts and finding that a bit odd.", "Does he privately recognize your grievances about the racism and misogyny?", "That\u2019s horribly toxic.

Personally I'd be giving him the option between weekly counseling and divorce papers.", "How do they gaslight him? Your husband is right there when his parents make racist comments towards you.

I mean hell, him not putting his foot down when you're sick is bad enough on its own.\n\nI do wonder if you're asking about holidays, or in general? If you're only seeing these people once a year and you don't want that, you're basically asking him to stop seeing his family.

He has had to see you get very upset or even cry if this has been going on for awhile. \n\nI know this is easier said than done but you know the truth, we all on here know the truth about how out of line they are talking/behaving, so tune it right out when you do end up coming in contact with them again.

Didn\u2019t even know these things existed lol", "Yes, he does. He used to get upset whenever we would talk about it, but now he seems to understand and acknowledge it all.

People truly need to understand that if you marry into a family with racist attitudes your partner is likely tacitly racist as well.

You have some things you need to rethink.", "NTA. Simply refuse to host and to show up to events. Also do not let your child anywhere near those racist ass people and tell your husband he can choose you and your child or he can go live with mommy", "Married person here. It isn't ur place to check her or educate her. That's her child's place to do so. Anyone outside of him and it'll cause drama. They will always love and forgive their kid, but not you. And this can strain things if kids are ever popped out etc. If he is unwilling to set her straight and have some boundaries then...I recommend stop going to visit them. If he wants to let him. But a good partner would set his family straight.  If he can't or won't...may not be compatible in the long run.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your in-laws are serious pieces of work.  If he's too cowardly to stand up for you, then you need to set hard boundaries. Don't allow his need to please his mommy to prioritize your need for respect.  \n\nAlso, quit buying the witch thoughtful gifts.  They want to be racist then play cultural ignorance, and buy her Halloween clearance stuff from tjmaxx. Specifically, witch related stuff.  Tell her you saw it and immediately thought of her.", "So your husband is also racist?  If he wasn't he wouldn't tolerate their behaviour towards you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. His family is abusive, especially your MIL. Your husband should be taking up for you, but he sounds brow beaten by his mother and has probably endured her toxic, manipulative behavior for so long, he figures the best way to deal with it is to not say anything. He couldn't be more wrong. The best way to deal with people like your inlaws is NC. If that isn't possible, then I would establish very clear boundaries. Tell him and your in laws moving forward they will be asked to leave your home and will not be welcome back if they exhibit any toxic behavior whatsoever. Then, follow through. This is the only way they'll know you mean business. Furthermore, never go anywhere with your MIL again for any reason. You can tell her exactly why. Its because you do know her intentions and they are not appreciated and no amount of gaslighting or manipulation is going to change your mind. Call your inlaws out for every discretion, ask them to repeat what they say loudly, confirm why it's toxic, then tell them: \"don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.\"", "one thing I've noticed in situations like this (where the person wont stand up to their racist family/excuse wildly racist behaviour - not all inter-racial or inter-cultural relationships) is the people from super racist families have actually just bought into all the stereotypes but in a fetishising way.\n\nlike..\n\nfamily: XYZ race *definitely* are -insert racist thing- and its DISGUSTING \ndude who wont stand up to his family: XYZ race *definitely* are -insert racist thing- and its *disgustingly sexy*\n\nlike. dudes out here thinking buying into racism but being like \"how could it *possibly* be racist when I've willingly involved my *willy* in this\". like - first of all, you'd fuxk any stray pomegranate you found on the ground, where you are willing to shove your dick should not be the yardstick..", "And is he afraid of all of this which has already hurt you? I'm sorry to say, but you have a husband problem. He needs to be on your side.", "This. Can\u2019t respect the mum then no time with the child. They will bad mouth you!"]}
