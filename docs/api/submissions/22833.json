Chloe and I had a rocky start to our friendship and it has never recovered. When they started dating I\u2019d meet them out for drinks or talk to them at the house and chloe seemed nice and I could tell she was really making an effort. \n\nSo I date casually and am not into anything serious right now. Chloe is weird about this and I think it\u2019s because of something I\u2019ve experienced before with girls who date Sam. They see me as a threat. As we are close, so my opinion matters and I love to go out and socialize. I\u2019m a liability to the relationship (been told this multiple times). \n\n3 months ago I brought a girl home and they were in the living room. The next night a friend of mine met us out. At some point in the night Chloe pulled my friend aside and told her about me bringing the girl home and \u201cwarned\u201d her. My friend told me about it and I called out Chloe. She apologized and kept apologizing for a week about it. I told her it was fine but it was at that point I knew I couldn\u2019t trust her. I\u2019m friendly with her still but no longer tell Sam things when she is around. \n\nSo this past weekend we were planning on hanging around our pool. Chloe\u2019s friends were having a pool party and she told Sam they were going and then invited me. I told her no thank you and she asked why. I said that I was planning on hanging at our pool. She asked what was wrong with her friends pool as it was at a house and would be exclusive. I said that isn\u2019t what I wanted and Sam could go and I\u2019d hang by myself. Well Chloe kept saying all her friends would be there and I should re-consider. I said her friends being there is a deterrent and isn\u2019t helping her sell. She demanded to know what I meant. \n\nAt this point it was getting heated for some reason and I tried to disengage and go to my room but she kept at it. I finally said that all her friends are married, divorced, engaged or single moms. She\u2019s not shown me one single attractive friend that doesn\u2019t have a kid yet. So no thank you, I\u2019d prefer spending time at our pool that has those options. Not sitting around a pool with her friends talking about school districts or baby steps. During this she called me a douche bag. So I said this exactly \u201cstop being a dumbass. You want me there so you can keep on eye on us. You want to set me up with one of your single mom friends so you\u2019ll have less to worry about and it will be easier for you relationship. You\u2019ve tried to fuck with me before and I caught you. So how about you just loose my number okay? Cool thanks\u201d. Left the apartment and had a nice day at our pool. Sam has reached out multiple times apologizing but wants me to do the same to chloe. As she was upset about me calling her a dumbass. I said she needed to grow up and stop taking things personal.

And I think she got the hint after she pushed you. What's wrong with taking \"no\" for a complete answer with some people?? No means no, dammit.", "NTA. Chlo\u00e9 is the one who has been causing problems and is the one who kept pushing for a reason you didn't want to go to the party.\n\nIt should also be noted that Sam apologized; Chloe didn't, so I'd give him the same: apologize to Sam, not Chloe. Then tell him you feel it's best for you and Chloe to have minimal interaction for a while.", "NTA- I\u2019m a female and I agree that Chloe needs to stay out of your dating life. Pulling your female friend aside to warn her, because you had a girl over the night before was out of line. Also I wouldn\u2019t have fun at a pool party where everyone is talking about kids and school districts. I don\u2019t care to hear about it at the spa where I\u2019m trying to relax.", "NTA. She doesn't have the right to interfere in your love life. I would be frustrated, too. I don't think it would be a bad thing to apologize for calling her a dumbass, but not the rest of it.

Also, I\u2019d consider half-ass apologizing so your poor friend is out of the hot seat. I feel bad for him.", "ESH. Wow, where to start with this one? Firstly, I think you need to have a chat with Sam and explain that it makes you uncomfortable to constantly have Chloe's eyes on you. Let him know that she has repeatedly said and done things to you and your relationships (both platonic and romantic) that made you uncomfortable and she was out of line. If you don't see Chloe as a friend of yours, there's no need to disrespect her as she is your friend's significant other, but you need to make it clear that the same respect isn't being given to you. If your friend, Sam, can't have a productive conversation with Chloe about this then he may need to reevaluate his relationship with her, or if he refuses to say something you may need to reevaluate your relationship with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't necessarily think you're an AH for attempting to set boundaries with Chloe and make it clear that going to her friend's pool just wasn't something you had in your plans for the day, I do think your an AH for insulting her and her friends. If her friends aren't your type that's okay, and Chloe should respect that and not push the issue (however going to the event may have still been nice even if you don't plan on pursuing any of the women there), but I don't think it was appropriate to degrade all of them to Chloe. All it did was give her ammo to go back and tell Sam if she truly isn't a fan of his and your friendship and is trying to ruin it.", "NTA. She couldn't take no as an answer.

I was right, all she did was gossip and lie", "My go-to when someone doesn't accept the first no thank you is to just stare them dead in the eyes with a huge smile while really excitedly saying no thank you over and over. Works really well. \n\nBut yeah, I agree, I don't know why people press for an answer so much only to be upset with the truth. You asked?!", "I SWEAR THIS POST WAS IN HERE RECENTLY AND HE WAS DUBBED TA - this is just an edited version to make himself seem better .", "The warning part i think is fair enough, the girl he had the night before could have an STD or something and OP wouldn't know so soon, and could pass it on to her. That girl mightve been really uncomfortable knowing that he had a girl over just that night before and very often. But yeah she should butt out otherwise", "I think it was the comment \"your friends being there is a deterrent and not helping the sell\" that made Chloe push. She didn't desperately want him to be there, she wanted to know what he meant about her friends. That's not a bad thing.", "I think this might be the same person that often posts scenarios where the best male friend is considered a threat to a straight relationship and the 2 men end up together in updates or later comments.", "What was changed/added? I didn't see the previous post", "Can you post the link?", ">but I don't think it was appropriate to degrade all of them to Chloe.\n\nmaybe I'm being a dumbass myself here, but where on Earth did he degrade them?\n\nFrom what I'm seeing, he said \"all your friends are taken/divorced/single mums and I'm not into that shit\" \n\nnow, you might be referring to the \"you've not shown me an attractive one\", but he says \"an attractive one that isn't a Mum\" - basically, he's saying that some of them ARE attractive, but that he doesn't want to hook up with a single parent, nor does he want to (obviously) hook up with someone who's married.\n\nwhere's the degrading?", "Yep the whole \"Sam's girlfriends see me as a threat\" indicates there's a pattern of behaviour here. It's not just Chloe being a \"crazy chick\".\n\nI was NTA until the \"the only girls she's brought around me are single mums\", OP is showing his true colours there.", "Sam is the only victim here. This friendship has been as issue for multiple of his gfs and OP is not bothered about how this could be impacting his friend.", "The other is \u201cwhat part of no don\u2019t you understand?\u201d", "Another great reply is, \"What part of \"No\" do you not understand?\"", "> The warning part i think is fair enough\n\nno it isn't\n\nliterally none of her business", "He literally said \"no thankyou\" and she should have left it at that. But she wanted to be nosiey and dramatic. NO MEANS NO! the conversation should have ended there and she should ha e left him ALONE!\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "What? She was pushing before that. OP had told her no, and that should have been  it.", "I was confused why a straight friend would be a threat, but this makes sense.", "My boyfriend and I used to press one of his friends to just hang out with a girl because any time we cooked dinner together or told him about a date he was with us. He was either with us or alone so we couldn\u2019t really just tell him to leave us alone.", "Yes she was overstepping and was an A H, but that doesn't mean we don't have multipls A H's. He went the cheap route to ending the conversation by insulting her and belittling her friends. It wasn't necessary.", "I mean... not wanting to date single moms is not that crazy imo. Specially bc he's not looking for anything serious or long term, kids in the mix complicate things", "That doesn't make sense tbh, if Sam was going to the pool party and you wernt why would she be worried about you saying bad things whilst you sit by yourself at your pool?", "\u201cThe N or the O?\u201d was how my mom ended that question", "What I would have done is say no thank you ignored her when she pressed then I would go get ready say bye to my roommate then leave. In my personal opinion she doesn't even deserve a reply", "I guess so\n\nIts just my personal opinion in the end, so its not like anyones gotta agree with me", "Yeah she's not perfect in this situation, but why go on about her friends etc? That's the step too far IMO.\n\nBeing annoying is one thing, being disrespectful is another.", "Yeah she was being pushy, but going on about her friends was uncalled for, especially if his logic was so toxic. OP showed his true colours.", "I think you should have though! Single people should get that a couple needs to have time alone together. Don't let people be oblivious when you have the key to to tell them about their behavior! Was he violent?", "I thought it meant Each Some Hole all this time", ">OP can just play tit-for-tat with Chloe insulting her every time they disagree.\n\nWell that's certainly one way to revise what happened in order to place blame on OP. Well done.", "Not wanting to date single mums isn't really the same as saying \"you're friends being there is a deterrent\".", "She wasn't being disrespectful when she crossed his boundaries when he said no though?", "You said that his comment about her friends being a deterrent was what made her push. I maintain that if she hadn\u2019t pushed he wouldn\u2019t have made the comment. Was it mean? Absolutely. Was she going to accept no for an answer? Doesn\u2019t look like it.\n\nEdit: mistyped a word.", "Well, everyone does have a hole, so that is technically accurate", "I thought it was Equally Shared Hole", "The way I understood it, the gf was trying to convince him to go bc her friends would be there and he could flirt and what not. But since he's not interested in her friends it wasn't something he wanted.\n\nI think that's fair? It definitely doesn't sound very nice, but she kept pushing so he was blunt \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Chloe didn\u2019t say anything about hooking him up with any of her friends. Preferences are irrelevant. She invited him to a party. Women exist for other reasons than being screwed.", "But OP wasn't pursuing that day he wanted to sit home alone. So I'm not sure why he was like \"I don't want to date your friends\", this idea Chloe wants him to date her friends is entirely made up in OPs head, she is literally warning other women about him, she probably doesn't want him near her friends in a romantic way.", "Yeah and if someone is warning strangers about you them they probably are probably not trying to set you up with someone. This is OPs imagination running wild.", "Being annoying is one thing, being rude and disrespectful is another. \n\nChloe was being annoying, OPs reaction was below the belt and shows their true colors.", "I honestly didn't see it that way. She's already warning other women she doesn't even know about him, hardly screams \"date my mate\". \n\nChloe was being pushy, but he didn't need to go down the route of \"you're friends aren't attractive to me\". That's what turned me to YTA.", "Gotta make him the bad guy, huh?  She did nothing wrong?", "But if you can\u2019t be rude to annoying people who wont take no for an answer, how DO you get them to go away? Legitimate question as I don\u2019t know of many other effective tactics that work for people like this and I prefer to be non-confrontational as much as possible", "I said she was being annoying but that bothers me less than being rude about people. That's my preference and I'm sticking to it", "I'm with you on this. If you're warning women about someone, you don't want them dating your friend. People on this sub don't seem to get that."]}
