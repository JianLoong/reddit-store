Chloe and I had a rocky start to our friendship and it has never recovered. When they started dating I\u2019d meet them out for drinks or talk to them at the house and chloe seemed nice and I could tell she was really making an effort. \n\nSo I date casually and am not into anything serious right now. Chloe is weird about this and I think it\u2019s because of something I\u2019ve experienced before with girls who date Sam. They see me as a threat. As we are close, so my opinion matters and I love to go out and socialize. I\u2019m a liability to the relationship (been told this multiple times). \n\n3 months ago I brought a girl home and they were in the living room. The next night a friend of mine met us out. At some point in the night Chloe pulled my friend aside and told her about me bringing the girl home and \u201cwarned\u201d her. My friend told me about it and I called out Chloe. She apologized and kept apologizing for a week about it. I told her it was fine but it was at that point I knew I couldn\u2019t trust her. I\u2019m friendly with her still but no longer tell Sam things when she is around. \n\nSo this past weekend we were planning on hanging around our pool. Chloe\u2019s friends were having a pool party and she told Sam they were going and then invited me. I told her no thank you and she asked why. I said that I was planning on hanging at our pool. She asked what was wrong with her friends pool as it was at a house and would be exclusive. I said that isn\u2019t what I wanted and Sam could go and I\u2019d hang by myself. Well Chloe kept saying all her friends would be there and I should re-consider. I said her friends being there is a deterrent and isn\u2019t helping her sell. She demanded to know what I meant. \n\nAt this point it was getting heated for some reason and I tried to disengage and go to my room but she kept at it. I finally said that all her friends are married, divorced, engaged or single moms. She\u2019s not shown me one single attractive friend that doesn\u2019t have a kid yet. So no thank you, I\u2019d prefer spending time at our pool that has those options. Not sitting around a pool with her friends talking about school districts or baby steps. During this she called me a douche bag. So I said this exactly \u201cstop being a dumbass. You want me there so you can keep on eye on us. You want to set me up with one of your single mom friends so you\u2019ll have less to worry about and it will be easier for you relationship. You\u2019ve tried to fuck with me before and I caught you. So how about you just loose my number okay? Cool thanks\u201d. Left the apartment and had a nice day at our pool. Sam has reached out multiple times apologizing but wants me to do the same to chloe. As she was upset about me calling her a dumbass. I said she needed to grow up and stop taking things personal.

And I think she got the hint after she pushed you. What's wrong with taking \"no\" for a complete answer with some people?? No means no, dammit.", "NTA. Chlo\u00e9 is the one who has been causing problems and is the one who kept pushing for a reason you didn't want to go to the party.\n\nIt should also be noted that Sam apologized; Chloe didn't, so I'd give him the same: apologize to Sam, not Chloe. Then tell him you feel it's best for you and Chloe to have minimal interaction for a while.", "NTA- I\u2019m a female and I agree that Chloe needs to stay out of your dating life. Pulling your female friend aside to warn her, because you had a girl over the night before was out of line. Also I wouldn\u2019t have fun at a pool party where everyone is talking about kids and school districts. I don\u2019t care to hear about it at the spa where I\u2019m trying to relax.", "NTA. She doesn't have the right to interfere in your love life. I would be frustrated, too. I don't think it would be a bad thing to apologize for calling her a dumbass, but not the rest of it. And that's not even that big of a deal anyway. So you do you.", "NTA, she tried to interfere in your love life and got called out. Then starts drama when you don't want to go to her poolparty. You shouldn't call her a dumbass but I'd tell her to mind her own business as well.", "NTA but in a few years your going to look a little creepy dating people who are young enough not to have baggage, lol. Also, I\u2019d consider half-ass apologizing so your poor friend is out of the hot seat. I feel bad for him.", "ESH. Wow, where to start with this one? Firstly, I think you need to have a chat with Sam and explain that it makes you uncomfortable to constantly have Chloe's eyes on you. Let him know that she has repeatedly said and done things to you and your relationships (both platonic and romantic) that made you uncomfortable and she was out of line. If you don't see Chloe as a friend of yours, there's no need to disrespect her as she is your friend's significant other, but you need to make it clear that the same respect isn't being given to you. If your friend, Sam, can't have a productive conversation with Chloe about this then he may need to reevaluate his relationship with her, or if he refuses to say something you may need to reevaluate your relationship with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't necessarily think you're an AH for attempting to set boundaries with Chloe and make it clear that going to her friend's pool just wasn't something you had in your plans for the day, I do think your an AH for insulting her and her friends. If her friends aren't your type that's okay, and Chloe should respect that and not push the issue (however going to the event may have still been nice even if you don't plan on pursuing any of the women there), but I don't think it was appropriate to degrade all of them to Chloe. All it did was give her ammo to go back and tell Sam if she truly isn't a fan of his and your friendship and is trying to ruin it.", "NTA. She couldn't take no as an answer. She didn't respect your boundaries. Your reasons are yours and yours alone. Anyone saying YTA just don't think no is an acceptable answer", "INFO: Why did you guys have a rocky start to the friendship?\n\nalso do you really think telling someone all her friends are ugly is a great way to resolve conflicts?", "NTA", "ESH. Chloe is clearly insecure and jealous of your friendship with Sam. She has no right to meddle in your dating life or try to set you up with someone you're not interested in.

Like why is she desperate in trying to set you up with her friends?\n\nIt does sound she takes everything personal though", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to go to a pool party to hook up and date girls. They were inviting you to have a good time. You didn\u2019t have to shit on her friends even if it\u2019s true. You could have made up an excuse or said you wouldn\u2019t fit in. Just lie in a situation like that because now your best friend\u2019s girlfriend is gonna start whispering in his ear about how much of an asshole you are. She\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be wrong either", "NTA. She wants you neutralized and in a relationship with one of her friends, so you can\u2019t threaten her relationship with your friend", "YTA.

In fact, I'm sure the sexism oozes off of you in real life the same way it does here, and she has probably picked up on it. YTA", "NTA  But take care of your relationship with Sam. Apologize to Chloe if he needs that to happen; it costs you nothing and it doesn't mean you have to hang out with her further.", "NTA. No is complete answer. She pushed until you have no patience for her bullshit\n\nAnd yes! Don't date single mom or dad. They arent worth it all of the drama that caused by..Id rather be old Maiden than to be stepmom (even though i love kids)", "YTA. Sure she shouldn't meddle in your dating life and she apologized for a couple weeks but you didnt let it go and you could have been quite a bit nicer about turning down her divorcee single mom friends and put it simply that you werent interested in kindling any kind of romantic endeavors with her friends.

Gross.", "I agree she's one as well, that's why my vote is Everyone Sucks Here", "There's more at play here than just that.
