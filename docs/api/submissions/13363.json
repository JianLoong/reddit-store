She was also a single mother to a little girl who I met a few times and I was pleasantly surprised how healthy and happy her daughter was. I had assumed that a sex worker would be a total mess and either be the living the high life or living a messy life of drama and drugs. I was really impressed by her. One night, over a bottle of wine, she told me that the reason she worked so hard in school and to take proper care of her daughter was because her entire family disowned her when she started working as a stripper at age 18.
