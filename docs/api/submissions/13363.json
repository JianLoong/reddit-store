The daughter (if she is on OF it's unclear) is at least independent, relatively free from exploitation, trafficking and the other dangers associated with sex work.

It makes them feel sexy and powerful.", ">NTA but y\u2019all need some family time\n\nMaybe they should arrange regular dinners or something", "It does not seem that OP \u201cdisapproves\u201d of his daughter\u2019s way of making money, he clearly says he does not understand why she made that choice.", "Am mechanic. Can confirm.", "I hope not. Doesn\u2019t he have a lift in his garage?", "Got rubbed the wrong way", "So, she's a handy man...so to speak.", "I worked with lawyers for 8 years and most of them told me to reconsider choosing to law school so that might not be the best example to use here", "Yep! And more than a few probably love benefiting from the services provided by sex workers.", "What does a cashier have to be proud of? Or a burger flipper? Or a barista? Or the retail worker who helps you find replacement underwear? These jobs don't have much to be proud of. They're unskilled labor - theoretically, with a modicum of training, *anyone* can do these jobs. They're not special. They're not really even careers unless you enter management. They're just jobs that pay a wage, a series of repetitive tasks that you perform until you drop dead or move on to greener pastures.\n\nBut if someone's content with the work they do, they earn enough money to live their lives as they desire, and they're happy being a small, yet essential part of the grand machine that is the modern economy, then *that's* enough for them to keep their pride and dignity. There's only room for so many CEOs, doctors, and lawyers - we need our garbagemen, our baristas, and our bartenders. A parent should be proud that their child is living a life of happiness and comfort, even if they don't necessarily like where they've wound up. Of course they want the best for their kids, but only their kids get to decide what that is.\n\nSex work is work. It's part of our economy, and since the dawn of human history it's existed in one form or another, possibly the oldest form of stress relief and entertainment in existence. It's also not much of a dead end. Depending on the industry, a worker can earn much more, and even become a capital owner if they play their cards right. Mock it all you want, but a stripper is as much a laborer as your local bartender. And in all my experience with that industry as a consumer, the people most likely to mock sex workers were the regulars. Let he who has never once cranked it to Sasha Grey cast the first stone.", "I guess the accomplishments in your statement were  \"made a lot of money\" and \"went to college\".

Takes a lot of time and attention.  But there are many jobs out there people aren\u2019t proud of. You can be happy that your family member is happy.  Not necessary proud.", "In college, I had a classmate that was an escort. She wasn\u2019t open about it, but we partnered up for projects a few times and she casually told me. It wasn\u2019t an issue for me, she was really nice and worked hard on our projects. She had a basic apartment, a basic car - nothing fancy. She was also a single mother to a little girl who I met a few times and I was pleasantly surprised how healthy and happy her daughter was. I had assumed that a sex worker would be a total mess and either be the living the high life or living a messy life of drama and drugs. I was really impressed by her. One night, over a bottle of wine, she told me that the reason she worked so hard in school and to take proper care of her daughter was because her entire family disowned her when she started working as a stripper at age 18. They literally cut all contact that same day and she hadn\u2019t heard from them since (she was in her mid-20\u2019s when we met). She had sent them letters and photos of her daughter and they never responded. She had decided to go to college and create a \u201cnormal life\u201d so that maybe one day, her family would take her back and love her again. I was heartbroken for her. She was a good person and a good mom that choose a controversial employment and who had been abandoned by entire family. We fell out of touch after the semester ended, but I think about her sometimes and hope that it all worked out. \n\nOP is NTA here. He might not approve of her lifestyle or be even be proud of her, but he loves his daughter, spends time with her and wants her to be happy. I\u2019m not sure, but I imagine that his actions as a father in this situation is more rare than reality for many.", "But at the same time it\u2019s difficult to express admiration for some of that as a parent, I would imagine. Like sure if she\u2019s making a ton of money, congratulate her, but it\u2019s kind of a big ask for a parent to be equally invested and ok with a career as a sex worker and a career as a data scientist.\n\nI believe sex work shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized, and that sex workers can have a lot to be proud of, but like he\u2019s her dad.

Frankly, my dad knows very little about my boring 9-5 job because my job isn\u2019t my personality.", "Well it's easy to assume she's just doing OnlyFans in which case, you are right probably not much possible advancement. If they were in more traditional adult films it could be working with a famous actor or actress, or both at the same time (I'm not judging). Could be a move into writing or directing. Or starting a publishing company. Personalized line of toys is probably not safe to share.", "I do supply chain management, more on the technical side - I don't talk specifically about accomplishments most of the time because they're hard to explain to lay people in a lot of cases - I just give the general idea.\n\nIt's not like you can't abstract your accomplishments with sex work - \"I'm halfway to my subscriber goal ahead of schedule \" - it's not like you describe how you did it, but that could even possibly be innocent enough - \"I realized I wasn't hitting the best markets yet on social media\".  \"I saved enough for a down payment on a house\" - no explanation needed to begin with.  It's all about packaging, regardless of projection.  \n\nSex work isn't just the South Park meme:\n\n1. Take clothes off\n2. ???\n3. Profit\n\nWhile some obviously take it more seriously than others, there's a lot of creative work to do, there's a lot of analysis to do, there's a lot of personal upkeep, and that's just the start of it.

Maybe it's not quite analogous to a corporate promotion, but they're still accomplishments. NAH in my opinion- OP seems open and accepting about his daughter's work, but I think they're both just navigating uncharted waters and need to figure out how to relate to one another. It's also possible she's projecting some internalized shame about sex work; it can be hard to unlearn that shit.

Why would the father want to know his daughter is meeting with a photographer to boost the quality of her content? Or that she hit a subscriber goal or that she\u2019s a top 5% onlyfans creator? It\u2019s not that these aren\u2019t milestones she should be happy with. As a friend I\u2019d be happy to hear these and support her.

Also, she's probably gained some serious wisdom in relation to boundary setting/not taking shit, etc.  I think the OP has a chance to forge a stronger relationship with Lily if he starts listening and asking more questions.  He has to get over his discomfort and think outside the normal list of tangible success.\n\nWhen I had to go on disability five years ago, I had intertwined who I was with what work I did.  It took time, but intangibles like lower stress, focusing on having a peaceful environment, and detaching from a consumer mindset became a healthier measurement of success.\n\nEvery person has reasons for doing the work they do.  Finding out what her daughter uses to determine her success and valuing them because she values them will go a long way in growing his relationship with her.", "Is he really supposed to know? \"Hey honey, what kind of sexually explicit content and/or services do you provide for people to make your living?\" Seems like more than I personally would want to know about my child without their explicit desire to share that information.\n\nAnd if she were doing something charitable with her income that she would like to be congratulated for, she would have to mention it first. Sex work is not something to be ashamed of, but it's also just a job. She has not presented anything special about her job that is worthy of congratulation, so she hasn't received any.", "Have you worked in a modern garage? \n\nAlso, I think you are missing my point. I was being figurative.", "I don\u2019t understand why you are being downvoted; I think you made a reasonable suggestion.  The OP can tailor your suggestions with what he feels comfortable asking and can even say he doesn\u2019t want her to get explicit, but is interested in a broad sense, e.g. from the business aspect.", "Yep!

It's not about how much money she made.", "Not sure about that everything you\u2019ve said.  \n\nMore what I meant is some jobs just need to be done.

He would tell people that he\u2019s not proud of his job. It helps him live the way he wants to, and compensates him handsomely.

Also I literally said it was his daughter, I don't know where you got this random friend thing.", "He\u2019s apparently made an environment where she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable discussing things. Working on that would be a first start. And why would she bring up what she does with her money if it\u2019s source isn\u2019t being discussed. Everyone here is acting like the only aspect of sex work is prostitution. There are more avenues into that world. All of which can have accomplishments.

I want to know what you would say to your daughter who fucks people for a living. I don\u2019t care how open minded a person is. They do not want to discuss the details of them being paid for sex.

That\u2019s why I said it depends on the sex work. Lots of dominatrixes don\u2019t fuck people at all. Talking about very weird requests from clients could be quite funny! Then there\u2019s onlyfans which often is just pictures without sex and you could easily talk briefly about the business end (subscriber count, self marketing, etc). Strippers don\u2019t always fuck people for extra money. Lots of strippers at higher end clubs don\u2019t have to be involved in that shit at all. Again, they can talk about their coworkers or how nice it is to have a flexible schedule.\n\nA lot of y\u2019all seem very narrow minded and inexperienced in actually knowing what facets of SW there are. Incredibly judgmental and unnecessarily cruel. OP is doing his best as a dad and I noted multiple times that it\u2019s normal he wouldn\u2019t know how to talk about that stuff with his daughter without knowing more context and provided possible scenarios depending on the type of SW. Like I said, NAH. Reasonable for daughter to want to feel like her dad isn\u2019t ashamed of her; she is the offspring, sometimes parents have to be the ones to ask questions in order for the child to open up when they feel like their parent might be ashamed of them. I was not knocking on OP at all and offering suggestions to improve an awkward conflict.", "If I\u2019m a dad and I\u2019m writing this post and my daughter is on onlyfans taking solo pictures and videos or a stripper, I would use those words. If she was a prostitute, I would call her a sex worker. I could be wrong, but that\u2019s probably how most people feel. I\u2019m sure there are dads who are proud of their daughters SW work, but they are the slim minority. I get that you\u2019re trying to help, but outside of a right wing politician, what job would be worse for your kid to have? He can still love, support and respect her while hating her career. I commend you on your optimism, but I just can\u2019t get on board with this line of discussion (even though you didn\u2019t provide much for examples of dialogue).", "You can spend that how you want.. but unless \u201cdaddy\u201d is the pimp no father wants to go into detail about their daughter\u2019s sex life..", "Totally agree.
