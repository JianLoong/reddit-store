The only people who know are my husband, mom, brothers, and my husband's family. I have a cousin (23F) who I haven't seen in about 10 years as she lives in Belgium and I live in the US. From time to time, she reaches out to me. A couple of days ago, my cousin texted me and congratulated me on my pregnancy, and I was really shocked how she knew. I didn't want any of my extended family to know yet. I told her it was such a random thing for her to say, and I brushed it off. She had said that her mom (my aunt) had told her, and she just wanted to give her congrats. I told her I wasn't pregnant, and she started apologizing, saying it was probably a miscommunication. I just left her on read. Then she texted me again saying, it was my mom who told her mom, and now she's confused.\" I told her it would've been better she didn't ask me at all and that I would've wanted to announce it instead on social media. I deleted the chat, and she just left me on read. I don't know if I reacted a bit rude to her.

It's not her fault that your mom decided to share your private information.  You were rude and took your anger out on the wrong person.", "YTA.  I get being upset that someone spilled the beans but you\u2019re directing your anger at the wrong person - you should be mad at your mother.\n\nWhat you should\u2019ve said to your cousin is \u2018thank you for the message - I wasn\u2019t ready to tell everyone yet, would you mind keeping it quiet until I\u2019m ready to announce my pregnancy?\u2019\u2026\n\nYou could\u2019ve been graceful and polite to your poor cousin, instead you\u2019ve likely burned bridges with her.", "YTA...its wasnt random or odd... She was told by her mom who was told by your mom.  The proper response would have been:  \"Thank you but it was supposed to be a secret so could you please not tell anyone.\"  Then go to your MOM who told when she wasn't supposed to.", "YTA. \n\nwth is wrong with you. why are you acting as if your cousin went out of her way to purposefully make you upset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I told her it would've been better she didn't ask me at all and that I would've wanted to announce it instead on social media.\" \n\nahh i get it it you wanted your feel good social media clout... /s", "YTA.

Don\u2019t be mad at someone congratulating you.", "How dare people be happy for you.\n\nYTA", "YTA her mom told her and she reached out to you. Your own drama and backstory was unknown to her. A bit of advice\u2026you\u2019re going to need to toughen up a bit as you become a parent.", "YTA. What exactly do you think she did wrong in this scenario? She was told you\u2019re pregnant because your mom can\u2019t keep a secret. She reached out to congratulate you, and you lied, told her she shouldn\u2019t have reached out, and brought up social media for some reason. You were definitely rude. If you\u2019re mad at anyone it should be your blabbermouth mother.", "OP, I hope you apologize to your cousin because you were completely rude to her for only finding out and congratulating you. YTA.", "YTA \n\nYour cousin did exactly zero things that would justify you being rude to her. Poor girl, she was just trying to by nice and you had to go and act like an AH", "YTA. I'm pregnant as well and haven't done a social media announcement, but plenty of people in my life know about it. Some people found out before I was ready. I don't blame those people, I blame the people who blabbed. Your cousin was being nice and you lied to her, making her doubt her mother. There's a million better ways you could have handled this. \n\nGeneral life advice, don't lie about things that can very easily be fact checked. You just come off as unreliable and potentially unstable depending on the circumstances.", "YTA!  You could've just said thank you so much but please don't say anything to anyone until we announce it online, we will speak soon and hope you're well.", "Yyyyy TTTTT AAAAASA. Holy hell. Where do you get off?", "Yeah YTA it's not her fault she found out and you reacted rudely.\n\nBe pissed at your mom instead.", "YTA - I certainly hope this is pregnancy hormones making you so blind to decent human interaction.  It would be different if she posted it or outed you to others, but she chose to private message you and then you deny your pregnancy?!", "YTA. She was polite and congratulated you. She had no way of knowing you would be offended she was told. Your problem is the family you trusted gossiping. Your cousin didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She congratulated you when she was told you were expecting. She apologized when you said you weren\u2019t pregnant. She then let you know who was spreading the news you were. Exactly what do you think she did wrong?", " YTA. You should have been honest and told her that you were not okay with the news being spread and that you would like her to keep it to herself while you have a chat with your gossipy mom. She would get the message and stay mum. It wasn\u2019t her fault someone told her.", "YTA. A simple \"thank you, I appreciate that. Please keep it under wraps if you'd be so kind, though, because we don't want word getting out any further than it has\" would have worked just fine. She was being polite, and you were kind of a b***h to her for no justifiable reason.", "I don\u2019t understand why you would lie about. She clearly knows whether you\u2019d like her to or not. Regardless of how she found out she was trying to be kind and congratulate you. Is this the type of example you\u2019d like to set for your child? Would you be okay with your child acting like this? All things you\u2019ll have to consider soon. YTA.", "YTA. She did the polite thing when she found out. If your mom and ant were suppose to tel people then you should be mad at them. But as long as she didn't put it on social media and announce your pregnancy she did nothing wrong. \n\nShe did nothing wrong, and now you lied to her and treated her like a villain. If I was her I would no longer care your pregnant or anything about you. Don't seem like a reasonable person", "YTA. If you told your mother not to spill the beans I could see why you would be annoyed with your mother. \n\nYour cousin did nothing wrong. Including having another conversation with her mother that I suspect went something like this:\n\nCousin: Hey, I'm not sure where you heard OP is pregnant, but I congratulated her and she said it wasn't true. You might want to let whoever else know that you had the wrong info. \n\nCousin's mom: Huh? I got it from her mother...", "YTA. She was being nice and polite and this is how you say thanks?\n\nYour mom was the one who started telling people. Be mad at her for taking that away from you. Not your cousin who was literally just saying congrats.", "YTA. Why is she the one being blamed when she found out via your mom telling people? If you want to be angry at anyone about the level of your secret, turn it towards your mom. \n\nYour cousin reached out to you privately after finding out exciting news. She just wanted to share in your joy.", "YTA.  Nothing wrong with showing people a little grace, especially when they didn't do anything wrong.  She was told by your family, she was being polite.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not her fault that your mom shared your personal information. Your cousin was just being nice, and you are misdirecting your frustration at your cousin instead of your mom", "YTA\nThe correct response would have been \"thank you, but you aren't meant to know yet. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone else\"\n\nIt was your mother who was going around telling people, don't take it out on the people who've told congratulating you when they don't know they're not meant to know.", "Look, I get it, I'm currently 21 weeks along and wanted to announce at my own pace. Had one cousin who blurted it out in front of a room full of relatives so I was kind of peeved at that.\n\nBUT your issue is not with your cousin who, frankly, was very sweet and gracious and just wanted to convey her well-wishes. Your issue is with your MOTHER who took the opportunity from you to tell your extended family.\nHOWEVER, I get where she's coming from as she is likely close to her sister and couldn't contain her excitement... \n\nThen again.... make a facebook post? Seriously? Do you even like your relatives? I would have sooner given my mom permission to tell her loved ones personally rather than announced it in such an impersonal way. \n\nEither way, YTA towards your poor cousin and should apologize. Profusely...", "YTA.", "YTA. If you want to be pissy and rude, direct it towards the people YOU told.  If you didn\u2019t tell them to keep it a secret, it\u2019s really on you.\n\nYou should apologize to her. She was just being nice.", "YTA, it's hardly her fault that your mum couldn't keep her mouth shut", "TyA. People find out through various sources. Guaranteed she won\u2019t be sharing and happy news your way. You insipid grinch", "YTA.  You need to be mad at your mom.  Or yourself for telling a ton of people and getting upset that you disclosed it to people who can't keep their mouths shut.  Your cousin is blameless here.  She congratulated you privately.  The mature response to her would have been \"Thank you, and please keep this to yourself because I'm not ready to share.\"", "It's your moms fault for not keeping her mouth shut! YTA your cousin was being nice congratulating you, and you took your frustration (that should be for your MOTHER) out on her. Apologize to your cousin and have a long discussion with your mother. Get over yourself the world doesn't revolve around you just because you have a spawn coming.", "YTA. It's already been said plenty so I won't beat around the bush but be mad at whoever leaked it to others. I personally know how it can feel to have a special announcement like that ruined by family and as much as it sucks the person who gave the info out is that blame not the person who received it. Even though they don't talk to you they still went out of their way to congratulate you which is a very nice thing to do, be better and maybe apologize to them bc your absolutely in the wrong there.", "YTA how would she know that you\u2019d want it to yourself a bit? Should have just said \u201cthanks but keep it on the down low a bit\u201d then communicate to your mom how you want to proceed. Omg you were so unnecessarily rude.", "Yes you were rude. Your beef is with the people who told your business without permission not the one they told your business to good lord. YTA & you owe your cousin an apology.", "I can understand being upset that she knew when she shouldn\u2019t but she didn\u2019t go out seeking the information. Be mad at your mom for being a blabber mouth not at the person who didn\u2019t ask to know. YTA for your handling not your feelings. This is literally why if I ever got pregnant my mom would be last to know.", "Yta. It\u2019s not her fault she was told. Take it out on your mum or her sister, whoever spread it without your consent.", "YTA. Not her fault your mom shared the news you didn't have to be a dick about it", "YTA. That was rude. She was told information about you and was trying to be nice. None of this is her fault, take it up with your mother how she knew.", "YTA. My ex informed his Mom about my pregnancy with my now fianc\u00e9 and it spread like wild fire all through his family and eventually it made its way to my Mom who thankfully I had been able to tell before hand. \n\nTo say I was mad was an understatement. But I wasn\u2019t mad at the people who congratulated me because of the info leak.", "Yta go off at your mother not your cousin", "YTA. When that many people know, it is bound to get to other FAMILY members. She was doing the nice and decent thing to do which was to congratulate you on  what should be good news. What did you think lying about it would get you? You are actually pregnant. If you wanted to announce it to the rest of your people in your own way, all you had to say was thank you and to please help in keeping it under wraps until you are ready to let others know.", "YTA. \n\nYour cousin did nothing wrong, and you lied to her repeatedly, had her apologize to you when she again didn't do anything wrong, and then told her it would be better if she didn't ask- well she didn't ask someone told her. \n\nYou were rude to her, and you weren't \"a bit rude\", you were very rude. If you didn't want the information to get out, that's understandable, but it did, and not because of your cousin. So instead of lying to her and making her feel bad, you should have called your mother and asked her how people knew, told your mother to fix it, and just politely text your cousin and said \"sorry, I didn't want the info to get out yet, so was a little taken aback at your text, but we will be announcing soon and thank you for the kind words.\"\n\nYou are about to have a child, so maybe work on your basic people skills.", "You sound exhausting. YTA", "YTA- she didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to know. She was kind and offered congratulations. You should have thanked her and then let her know that you are actually no telling anyone else at this time so if she could keep it quiet it would be appreciated. Don\u2019t blame her for others actions.", "YTA - You gaslit for cousin for the sin of offering warm wishes...  There's no version of this story where you're not TA. Keeping your situation private is one thing, making someone think that committed a serious social faux pas is just messing with someone's head unnecessarily.", "YTA - your cousin didn\u2019t know that you wanted more privacy. You could have told her that and asked to not talk about it any longer. You can only blame your mom and aunt for it. Talk to your mother about boundaries and keeping personal information private. Wouldn\u2019t share with your mom more confidential information.", "YTA. It\u2019s your moms fault for spilling the beans to your aunt. Your cousin didn\u2019t do *anything* wrong. You should apologize.", "Of course you are. From what you stated, she had nothing but good intentions and it's obviously not her fault that the news reached her.\n\nYTA and rude as hell.", "YTA. Not her fault your mom let the cat out the bag. Then you gaslit her and denied the pregnancy when you could have just confirmed it and said you hadn\u2019t intended for the extended family to know yet and wanted to announce it later.", "YTA. She was not doing anything wrong and you were a jerk. You should apologize.", "You\u2019re allowed to tell whoever whatever you\u2019d like but do you have a reason you lied? Based on no further detailing YTA and your cousin was just being sweet.", "Of course you are. From what you stated, she had nothing but good intentions and it's obviously not her fault that the news reached her.\n\nYTA and rude as hell.", "YTA and you acted like an absolute prick to a person who just wanted to give you a congrats. Imagine, and I know this is mind blowing, that you put yourself in the other persons shoes, you get randomly informed a person you know is pregnant, so in joy, you send them a congratulations. How would you feel if that person acted like you did something wrong in being happy for them, like how dare they have been told information that they had no way of knowing was private, 3 seconds of thought should have given you an answer to this one. Go be mad at your mom instead of the people she tells your business to.", "YTA. You sound awful.", "She didn\u2019t fucking know you wanted to keep it secret. Somebody else told her. Why are you pissed off at her? She didn\u2019t do shit but be nice to you. You should be mad at your mother for telling the extended family that you didn\u2019t want to know yet. You owe her an apology.

Blame your mom for blabbing the news. Your cousin didn\u2019t know.", "YTA! You are so rude. It\u2019s nice she told you congratulations. You should apologize to her for being a massive AH.", "YTA. You should be mad at your mom, but only if you had a conversation with her about keeping in on the DL. If you told mom without any caveats then it's public information at that point.", "So YTA. She didn\u2019t know it was a secret, didn\u2019t leak it and was nice to you. I hope it\u2019s just the hormones but you were super rude. You should apologize asap .", "im so confused why you reacted this way.... YTA", "YTA. This is truly bizarre. She didn\u2019t out you or anything. She literally just text to congratulate you. If you\u2019re going to be mad at someone, be mad at your mom for telling people.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to know and reached out to celebrate with you. Put the blame where it belongs instead of on your poor cousin who didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "YTA. Your mom is the one with the big mouth. Why blame your cousin for that?", "YTA. Your mother is the big mouth that told someone. Your cousin was being kind. Don't be rude to her for something your mother did.", "You\u2019re being rude to your cousin because you want the chance to get attention on social media?", "So,a cousin just wanted to congratulate you to be nice.But you thought to lie about something that is out there and will eventually know that you lied because you ll give birth eventually.\n\nYta. At least deal with it like an adult.", "YTA. Why are you blaming her for your mother blabbing?", "YTA. That was sooooooooo RUDE of you  next time take it out on the person who spilled the beans.", "YTA. A family member found out and you lied? And then you blamed her? Why do you hate your cousin so much", "YTA", "YTA - people try to be nice and you throw it back into their faces. They didn\u2019t even do it publicly. Wow", "YTA", "YTA. She was trying to be nice. Your mom's the one that betrayed your trust. Don't take it out on your cousin.", "\"Hey OP, congratulations on your pregnancy!\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you!

I understand wanting to keep a pregnancy private but what is your fucking problem? \nBeing around you must be exhausting as hell.", "YTA.   How was she supposed to know that you didn\u2019t want it shared with extended family.  You should apologize and explain you were shocked she knew because your mom has a big mouth and it was not her news to share.  Then give your mom hell.  People keep telling their moms when they are pregnant and then shocked when they tell others.", "I can\u2019t imagine a more awful way to have handled the situation.

And childish at that.", "Ummm yes you were rude as hell to her. YTA.", "Yeah dude, YTA. If you want to be mad at someone be mad at your mom, not someone who simply congratulated you", "YTA. Also I think you may be afraid of confronting the people who betrayed your trust so you\u2019re taking it out on an innocent bystander. So, YTA again.", "YTA. Your cousin isnt at fault here and you were rude to her. Go confront your mother instead lol.", "Yta", "INFO\n\nAre you intending on being this way for the entire duration of your pregnancy? Irrational, rude?\n\nWhy didn't you confront your mother who is spreading the news?", "YTA why aren't you calling pur your mother for not respecting your wishes? Instead you're taking it out on your cousin who has done literally nothing wrong here. She was notified of your pregnancy and congratulated you. You even said that she does keep in touch so it's not even like she's just being nosy. She cares about you. \n\nWay to be ungrateful. Apologise to your cousin and speak to your mother. She's the one at fault here.", "Yes sorry in my opinion you're the YTA. Why be so cold to your cousin. It's your mom who told others. They are happy for you, just a thank you would have been enough.", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re an asshole persay but that was extremely rude. The person you should be upset at is your mom.

You didn\u2019t \u201cignore\u201d her congratulations, you lied to her and berated her when she was just trying to be nice. Your anger was seriously misdirected (I understand trying to keep the circle small early in the pregnancy, but it\u2019s not your cousin\u2019s fault that your mom spilled the beans). You owe your cousin a huge apology!", "YTA.  She tried to say something nice so you lied to her then acted like she did something wrong.", "YTA as your cousin can\u2019t read your mind, and it would have been rude of her *not* to congratulate you. Unless you\u2019ve clearly communicated to your family not to spread the news, I\u2019m not sure why you expect they will know your plans. Why not announce it on social media now that the cat is out of the bag? If you\u2019re before the 15 week window and don\u2019t want to announce it until the risk of miscarriage drops, it seems unfortunate that you\u2019ve already told some people if it means you have to wait.

If anyone of our relatives that knew let it slip to other family members, my issue would have been with them. Ya know, the ones who knew you didn't want people knowing but couldn't keep their mouth shut anyway? Them, NOT the person congratulating me.

We told one of my partners cousins because we saw him and he was talking about kids and asked us if we were planning on anytime soon. I was 20 weeks pregnant at the time and we didn't want to lie to him. We looked at each other, gave a little nod and told him.

My husband and I didn't tell anyone I was pregnant until after I was in the second trimester my next pregnancy (and all went fine!). \n\nGood luck to you!", "YTA.

I understand why you might not want to share you everyone but why are you blaming her and why did you LIE about it? It\u2019s definitely odd to say you prefer to announce to social media before people you know find out. I\u2019m struggling to understand your side or your motivations to even figure out why you think you wouldn\u2019t be TA", "YTA. what is the matter with you? Would \u201coh my gosh thank you! I\u2019m excited, but please don\u2019t share this info yet as we\u2019re waiting to announce it on Facebook\u201d HAVE BEEN SO HARD TO SEND? You sound very entitled, cold, and distant. Why are you punishing your cousin for your mom\u2019s faux pas? Goshhhhhh please take a hard look in the mirror and apologize to your cousin.", "Yes you are. She was just happy for you and didn't know about all the secrecy.", "I\u2019m waiting for a dirty delete, because I don\u2019t think OP was expecting this many people to respond this way. \n\nAlso, OP, you are a MAJOR AH.", "YTA. \n\nThis isn\u2019t her fault. You could have just been gracious and said \u2018Thank you!  Just as an FYI, I am keeping this under wraps, so please don\u2019t share with anyone else.\u2019\n\nThen had a conversation with your mother. \n\nShe wanted to share joy with you. It costs you absolutely nothing to be kind.", "YTA. Why is it your cousin\u2019s fault that your mom can\u2019t keep her mouth shut? It\u2019s quite obvious you were extremely rude. She\u2019s not psychic, and she obviously didn\u2019t know that you didn\u2019t want anyone to know. \n\nGood luck raising a baby, they can\u2019t read your mind, either.", "YTA - are you serious that you don\u2019t realize you were absolutely out of line???? How would she have known it was a secret and you had specific plans? She reached out to congratulate you! The proper response would have been \u201c thank you, I really appreciate hearing from you\u2026. We aren\u2019t telling people publicly yet so if you could just keep this to yourself for now I would really appreciate it\u201d so easy\u2026.. you spent a lot of energy to be a \ud83c\udf46", "YTA Not sure why that interaction became hostile on your side. Your reaction was unwarranted.", "So rude of you!\nYTA", "YTA what's wrong with you", "YTA. And childish! Next lvl AH move.", "You didn't just ignore her congratulations thats misleading. What you did is straight up lie about being pregnant all together. \n\nYou still could have made a social media post about your pregnancy without lying to your cousin. YTA", "> I told her it would\u2019ve been better she didn\u2019t ask me at all and that I would\u2019ve wanted to announce it instead on social media\n\nSo not only were you rude to your cousin when she sent a perfectly normal text to you, but you never planned on telling her directly anyway and wanted her to find out via your social media broadcast? (Which you can still do, by the way, no-one\u2019s taken that away from you.) YTA", "YTA. Your cousin is not the problem, your mom is. If you didn't want people to know then you should have told your mom not to tell anyone. Your cousin was being nice, since most people actually appreciate congrats from family.", "YTA absolutely - she is the manifestation of your problem not the cause. She didn\u2019t leak your secret, your mother did!\n\nGrow up and get mad at the person who broke your trust, not the well wisher who had no idea.", "YTA. You\u2019re getting mad at the wrong person and you seem to have major grump issues. I understand wanting to keep it somewhat private but 1) you told a lot of people 2) your cousin didn\u2019t sleuth out this info. She was told by her mom who didn\u2019t tell her it was private information. Not all of us are on FB or IG and cross check information to make sure it\u2019s public \ud83d\ude02", "Um, YTA. She knows. She didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to know. How is that her fault? You should apologize.", "YTA\nWhy do anyone but you and your husband know if you just recently found out and don't want people to find out? I just don't get why you would share it with a bunch of people and then get mad at someone for congratulating you when one of the people you told spilled the beans? You should be upset with your mother, not your cousin who was nothing but nice to you! Jeez Louise, go apologize and tell your mother to keep her mouth shut if you don't want people to know.", "YTA what is your problem? If you didn\u2019t want anyone to know should talk to your mom about that. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong and you were rude to her. You owe her an apology to try and stop the family drama you\u2019ve started.", "Wow. How silly of you.  It was quite obvious that one of your family must have told her; denying it is just silly.  SMH", "YTA wow. You lied to her?? \n\nShe was reaching out to congratulate you and then you lied to her, made her feel bad and awkward, then deleted the chat? You are behaving very strangely and honestly you should try to do some mindfulness/meditation or something to relax a little because babies are freaking hard and exhausting and you are going to need all your energy, compassion, and mental flexibility for the job ahead of you and right now you seem to have none. \n\nPlease apologize to your super sweet cousin and  leave her alone after that. I imagine you won\u2019t be hearing much from that side of the family anymore anyways but you really need to acknowledge that you were super mean and clear the air. She did nothing wrong and you were incredibly odd and unkind.", "YTA\n\nYou being mad about a cousin reaching out to you once in a while is weird. \n\nAlso your mom told people the news..be mad at her instead. It seems like you don't like your cousin for whatever reason so it's easier for you to be a dick towards her, I assume.", "YTA.", "Bit rude? Are you less empathetic or with no empathy that you can\u2019t comprehend that what is right and what is wrong? You should apologise to her ASAP.", "YTA. First it\u2019s not her fault, and you should have just accepted the congratulations and talked to your mom about leaking. Second, with the amount of people who know already, it\u2019s not a secret that\u2019s going to be kept. If you wanted it to stay a secret, then you should have just kept it between you and your husband.", "Went from a Greek adventure to a Greek tragedy in 0.5 seconds.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You're mad at the wrong person, it was your mom who leaked the info. She was just trying to be nice. Be mad at mom, not at your cousin who was trying to congratulate you.", "YTA. Your behavior makes zero sense. And if so many people know, it's not a secret. Can you even explain why you're so upset with your cousin for innocently and privately congratulating you?", "YTA. She literally just congratulated you and you chose to gaslight her? \nMaybe communicate that you're not comfortable? \nYou come across as rude, self centered. Was your mother even aware that you didn't want the extended family to know? You have a huge communication problem op.", "YTA. You lied and it wasn't her fault that someone told her. Text her again, apologize, tell her the truth, and ask her to keep it private for now. Then speak with your mom and aunt and tell them that you want them to stop telling people you're pregnant till you're ready.", "YTA\n\nYou were rude. If you want to be pissed at someone, get annoyed with your mom. She spread your private business. Your cousin just wished you well.", "YTA.  What did your cousin do wrong except know information that she wasn't supposed to know?  That's hardly her fault- the person you presumably need to be mad at is your mom for leaking the info to her sister.  She was wishing you well, how was she supposed to know your mom was spreading the news prematurely?", "YTA She did nothing wrong, you treated her badly. It was your mother telling everyone who is at fault.", "YTA, she doesn\u2019t know! She was just trying to be courteous by reaching out to you", "YTA\nShe clearly did not know that you were keeping it low profile for now and, from what you posted, seemed to be very polite about the whole situation even while you were being rude to her. If you should be upset with anyone, you should be upset with your mom; ONLY if you told the family members you announced to that you did not want anyone else knowing. Otherwise, it was just poor communication on your part.", "YTA. She clearly didn't know it was under wraps. If you want to be mad at someone, take it up with your mother.", "YTA. Jeez.", "YTA. Be mad at your loose lip mama.", "YTA and your mother too. Cousin did nothing wrong", "YTA and a big one!!! Your cousin was just congratulating you on information that was given to her! I wouldn\u2019t have questioned it if my mom told me. You should have nicely explained that it was confidential and found out how she knew the information. Chew out your mother! She is the motor-mouth!!! \n\nYou owe your cousin a HUGE apology!!", "YTA. Poor cousin", "YTA\nUnless she\u2019s NC or LC with you due to some awful past experiences, and this is one more straw to bear\u2026etc\u2026it\u2019s not her fault your mom blabbed. You\u2019re being rude to the wrong person here.", "YTA. she was well intentioned and clearly not the person who \u201cleaked\u201d the news. she obviously didn\u2019t know it\u2019s under wraps. I get being frustrated that your mom told people but it\u2019s not your cousins\u2019s fault. also telling her you weren\u2019t pregnant was a really odd choice. better idea: \u201cthanks! not sure how you found out but please don\u2019t tell anyone else yet! at least not till I post something on social media\u201d\n\ngood news is it\u2019s not too late to apologize", "YTA. How was your cousin expected to know how you wanted to announce this?", "YTA\n\nMy mom told my sister when I was pregnant before I did and I was not upset with my sister. I was pissed at my mom and let her know. Not that it helped cuz she went on to tell others in the family. Blaming the person who was told information they did not know they should not know is \ud83d\udcafrude.", "YTA. Most of the other comments have covered why, but I still wanted to throw in my vote", "YTA, you should just say \"thank you\"", "YTA. She was being kind and didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong. Get mad at your mom and aunt, don\u2019t be rude to your cousin.", "How was she magically supposed to know that it was a secret when for her it was just news she thought everyone else knew? YTA", "OP would probably get mad if her cousin didn't congratulate her either.\n\nPeople don't know what they want. They just know the way *they* want it to happen.", "YTA. She had no idea she wasn\u2019t supposed to know, and you treated her like shit for just being happy for you. The real person you need to be upset at is your mom.", "\u2026.That you wanted to announce it on social media? Grow up, who cares what those people think? That\u2019s your cousin who is genuinely happy for you and a \u201clike\u201d on your stupid post means more to you? YTA. I bet her congratulations would mean more to you if you get zero likes on your damn post but for some reason people who you probably don\u2019t talk to mean more to you.", "That seems like an overreaction to me. Why are you so upset at your cousin for saying congratulations to you? That's what people do when they hear someone is pregnant. If anything be upset at your mom for telling people. YTA.", "YTA.  You should be upset with your mom, not your cousin. When I was pregnant, my in-laws ignored our wishes not to tell people because I was high risk. When I miscarried they then had the task of untelling people. I did not envy them rhat task. The only people I had to untell was my employer (disclosed only because of my high risk status) and my dad (who respected our wishes not to tell anyone).\n\nAlso, I think you need to speak to your cousin and tell her the truth, including the fact that you hadn't wanted extended family to know just yet and you were surprised she knew. You also need to talk to your mom. I personally wouldn't trust her in the future with anything you didn't want the rest of the world to know. We don't tell my in-laws anything anymore that we want kept private.", "YTA. Why are you mad at her? What did she do? Your mom was the one with the big mouth.", "YTA.\n\n1. Your cousin isn't at fault here. She merely congratulated you after hearing the news of your pregnancy. That's what people normally do. Your need not have been so rude. A simple \"Thank you\" would have been nice. At the very least, you could have just ignored her message. You need not even have opened her chat.\n\n2. Your mother is the one who leaked your news to your aunt. If you had told your mother specifically to not do that, then you can confront her about it. If not, then it isn't even your mother's fault. You should have told your immediate family about your plans to make the announcement on social media first. People don't know what you want until you tell them.", "YTA. \n\nYour mom leaked the info, cousin was being very kind to congratulate you and is happy for you, and you got mad at her instead of your mom?\n\nYou need to put your mother on an info-diet if she can\u2019t handle keeping secrets. This isn\u2019t even an uncommon secret to keep.", "YTA. I totally get wanting to keep it a secret, but also understand how mothers can spread information quickly (my mom does the exact same thing). I would reach out to your cousin and apologize about how you were thrown off how she knew and you were planning on keeping it a secret. And maybe communicate to your mom how you would like her to not tell anyone else. I feel you were rude to your cousin and she is probably hurt and also confused.", "YTA. You LIED to her???", "Sorry to say but YTA.", "Congratulating a family member on their pregnancy is standard. Ignoring the congratulations is not. \n\nYTA. I\u2019m unclear how you could even get halfway through writing that and not have an epiphany that\u2019s the case.", "Definitely YTA. It sounds like cousin was trying to use the news of your pregnancy to rekindle your relationship/be in touch more. She had no way to know that your mom had blabbed too soon without your permission. Instead of speaking to your mom and asking her to zip it, you chose to rebuff your cousin and be quite rude. \n\nYou owe your cousin an apology, and you should speak to your mom about privacy.", "YTA.\n\nShe can't know any of the background. She called to wish you well.", "YTA, I understand wanting to announce it yourself but her sending you a private text to congratulate you doesn\u2019t take that away. It\u2019s not like she congratulated you on social media.", "Sorry but yta - you could have said hey, I\u2019m not sure how you know, thank you! It\u2019s early and I\u2019m not easy to share with the world yet. How\u2019s Belgium. Why would you lie? Also  have a talk with your mom\u2026 she\u2019s the one who spilled the secret without your consent", "All you had to do was be gracious, thank her for the congratulations and mention to her that you and your husband had decided to keep the news private to immediate family. You sound tedious. YTA.\n\nYou should apologize to your family since it was your mom who spilled the beans.", "Such a bizarre reaction. YTA", "YTA", "YTA. This is extremely bizarre. Idk what happened in your family that you treat people this way that were just trying to be nice, but you\u2019re angry at the wrong person. And your anger is also questionable. \n\nAre you like this with everyone, or just your family?!?", "YTA, How is it her fault that your mom can't keep her mouth shut?", "YTA \n\nLiterally, wut\n\nI get not wanting extended family to know yet, but that's something you should've talked to your mom about?\n\nWhy say you're not pregnant???\n\n\"That's so random, I'm not pregnant\"\n\n\"Well I am but I didn't want you to know. I wanted you to find out I'm actually pregnant through social media posts.\"\n\nLike, what was the logic", "YTA-what did your cousin do wrong? How was she to know?\n\nSounds like your mom is the problem here.", "YTA. How incredibly rude. You seem to think you\u2019re special and deserve to announce your pregnancy with an airplane writing it out in the sky?", "*Initiating scolding old aunty voice*\n\nWell...! Do you have any excuse as to why you behaved so abhorrently to someone who was politely congratulating you? Is that how you normally behave?\n\nYTA I hope your husband is the one to teach the child manners because you clearly have none.", "YTA 100% \nYour mom couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut. Don\u2019t blame your cousin for it", "YTA.  Your mom reveals it to the family and you blame a cousin who is trying to be nice.  Smooth move.", "Damn OP! YTA! \n\nYou were unnecessarily rude AF to someone who only wanted to wish you well! I hope that you\u2019re grown enough to apologize to your cousin after your judgment of \u201cASSHOLE\u201d here. \n\nBy the way, as many people that you\u2019d already told, did you really expect for your pregnancy news to stay a secret for long?? \n\nWho are you really mad at? Whenever you figure that out, go and tell them off instead.", "YTA \n\nYou are placing the blame where it doesn't belong. And then pitching a fit about it.", "YTA. You lied because you wanted the big reveal to be on social media? So you don\u2019t actually care about the congratulations you just want the clout. Am I interpreting that correctly?", "YTA. You could have just told her it's still a secret no need to be rude about it.", "YTA. You should be angry at your mom, not taking it out on her", "YTA - all the vibes here of one of those pregnant people who just think the world should revolve around their pregnancy. If you want to be pissy with anyone, try being pissy with your mother for breaking your trust.", "YTA - she was family trying to be kind?", "YTA why be like that? Sure, you didn\u2019t want everyone to know but now she does so say \u201cThanks, and please don\u2019t tell anyone. We\u2019re waiting to announce publicly.\u201d No need to be an AH about it. She texted you. It\u2019s not like she publicly congratulated you on social media. And then to lie afterwards? Uncalled for.", "What is with you\u2026", "YTA\n\nI prefer you see it on social media? Wt actual fuck kind of logic is behind that? I\u2019m asking seriously, I can\u2019t wrap my head around that.", "YTA, be mad at your mum, not your cousin, it\u2019s not like she was the one who spilled the news.", "YTA. It's not her fault your mom can't keep the secret. You are being rude to the wrong person, she was trying to be nice!", "You were extremely rude. It\u2019s not her fault your mom spilled the beans. I think it was very kind of her to congratulate you, even though you aren\u2019t that close anymore. That\u2019s what family does. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nAnd a drama queen.", "So she texted you privately? Not on a social media post or somewhere that others would see? YTA", "YTA and you sound like a control freak. You can\u2019t get mad at someone for trying to have a nice reaction to your pregnancy when they didn\u2019t even know they shouldn\u2019t know. If there\u2019s anyone to punish here, it\u2019s your mother. Tell her to keep her mouth shut.", "YTA, for being so bizarrely irate at your cousin who did nothing other than private message you to congratulate you, and she told you it was your mother who told her. It seems like you WANTED some sort of confrontation or argument with your cousin. And you know you were rude otherwise you wouldn't have deleted the chats. You should be embarrassed and apologize to the cousin.", "YTA", "YTA, this response is just strange.", "YTA. The only person you should be mad at is your mom. And yourself now that you treated your cousin like shit.", "YTA. You should be mad at your mom for gossiping, not your cousin.", "YTA \n\nHere is how you could have not been an asshole.  \n\nReplied to your cousin and say thanks for the congrats. We are trying to keep this quite right now and not telling anyone. Would you be able to keep this quiet and not share until we announce it on social media? Politely ask whom she heard it from. \n\nThen give your mom the riot act and come here to ask AITA for the way I reacted to my Mom not honoring her promise to keep her mouth shut? We could all then proceed to say you are not the asshole and omg you should like totally go no contact with your Mom.", "Your mom's big mouth is the problem. YTA", "YTA. Your mom is excited and shared it with her sister. Did you specifically ask your family not to share it with anyone? Even if you didn't, it is your news to share, I get that. But take it up with your mom not out on your cousin. Your cousin was just being kind and trying to connect with you. I think you're placing too much emphasis on a social media announcement over the personal relationship with your cousin.", "YTA. How hard would it have been to say \u201cthanks\u201d and move on with your day. Heaven forbid your family show an interest in your life.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure she will still like your post on Facebook when you announce it.", "You were very rude to your cousin who was just showing love and keep your relationship going although you\u2019re no longer very close... You took out your frustrations on her and she did nothing wrong. \n\nYTA", "You took out your frustration on the wrong person. YTA", "YTA what a strange way to behave when someone offers a congratulations. If I was your cousin you wouldn't be getting so much as a congratulations card when your baby does arrive due to being such an odd bod !", "YTA \n\nSo what's the real reason for having a nasty attitude toward your cousin??", "You were rude AF. YTA.", "YTA. This is so weird lol.", "YTA. Afanily member knows through connections to your immediate family. Its not like some high school bully texted you saying as such. Sounds like a big deal over nothing. Just say thanks and move on", "YTA for all the reasons people have already given, and why the hell did you lie to her about something she would obviously find out about? You need to deal with your immature attitude before you start raising a child.", "YTA. Regardless of who spilled the beans, her intent was only to congratulate you. You\u2019re getting mad at the wrong person here.", "YTA. You sound very rude. A thank you and please don\u2019t tell anyone else because I want to announce it would have been much better. How could she have known not to say anything?", "YTA, the responsibles of this situation are your aunt and your mother. Your cousin just wanted to congratulate you, how could she have guessed it was a secret?", "INFO: do you hate your cousin?", "YTA and a gaslighter. What is wrong with you?!", "YTA...wow", "YTA\n\nWhy are you taking it out on the wrong person?\n\nYour mother is the one who didn't respect your wishes, check yourself", "YTA. You are awful", "YTA. Pregnancy isnt an excuse to be a jackass to someone whose only crime was to congratulate you on your pregnancy.", "YTA", "YTA. Your poor cousin is trying to be kind and connect with you and you were so nasty. I agree you should have been allowed to announce your pregnancy as you saw fit, but that is something to raise with your mom. You need to grow up and get a grip.", "YTA just for the way you replied to your cousin, not for being upset that she knew. However you were upset at the wrong person, you should be upset with your mom and not your cousin. I\u2019d be talking to your mom and figuring out who else she told, then also she\u2019d be the last to find out anything about this pregnancy since she has proven that she will tell everyone she knows", "Yeah, everyone\u2019s already said it - YTA.", "She did nothing wrong why are you hateful to her.. your mom is spreading the news.", "YTA. For something you wanted to keep secret, you told an awful lot of people.\n\nIt sounds like your cousin meant well and likely didn't even know that you didn't want her to know. There was no reason to act as if she was in the wrong by congratulating you.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re mad at the wrong person. Your mom spread the news, and somehow you\u2019ve decided that\u2019s the fault of the cousin you haven\u2019t talked to in 10 years. \n\nSweetie, you owe your cousin an apology. Hormones are messing with you hard right now. \n\nYou need to speak to your mother about not keeping HER trap shut.", "How can you possibly have a doubt. YTA!", "YTA wtf!? She was polite, congratulating you and did so privately.\n\nIf you have an issue with anyone it\u2019s your mom for blabbing, not your cousin for doing what any normal person would do!", "Seems like the frustration should be directed at mom if and only if she was asked not to tell anyone. If you did not ask for it to be kept secret, YTA for expecting mom to be a mind reader. I think your cousin was unaware this was a secret, and you lying to her made her confused.\n\nSo, either mom or you are TA.", "Yta.  It couldn\u2019t be helped that she was told.  She was being sincere. You were beyond rude. And for literally what? Her being nice and offering a congratulations? Apologize", "Of course YTA.  She was being kind by reaching out to congratulate you and you were awful in return.  She had no idea that you weren't ready to make the announcement.  You should have either made it very clear to the family you did tell or expect that they were going to share the news.  You owe her a massive apology.", "Regarding your cousin YTA ... but in terms of the overall situation you have just learned there are people you cannot trust with your information. Your mother is the a-hole here, and you now know she will not keep your private info private. You need to talk to her.", "Wow you\u2019re a weird kind of asshat", "Yta. It's not your cousin's fault they found out, you should save this resentment for your mom if anything. Your cousin was just congratulating you.", "YTA. Jesus. I get wanting to keep your pregnancy to yourself until you are ready, but it\u2019s not at all this persons fault that they were told. Yikes!", "YTA incredibly rude. And super weird that you would just lie instead of thanking her. You should be mad at your mother for spreading news you didn\u2019t want shared, not to someone who was nice enough to congratulate you personally. I would think that is better than a Facebook comment but I guess some people need the public validation", "\"... I would've wanted to announce it instead on social media\" are you afraid that you're going to get one less like when you announce it online? How addicted are you? \n\nYTA.", "YTA. She reaches out to you because she wants to keep contact. If you don't want it, just tell her. Yes, you were rude. You should be angry at your mother, who told her mother and many others, I imagine. Your cousin was so polite and nice, and you met her with stone after stone.", "Wait\u2026 so your mother blabbed your news without your permission to someone who didn\u2019t know it\u2019s a secret. That person congratulated you and you\u2019re upset with her and not your mother? What universe and what logic does your head live in?\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nGrow up. You're about to be a mother. You have bigger fish to fry. Someone happily congratulated you on your pregnancy and you made it so negative. Why??", "YTA. You are going to be responsible for a small human soon. You really-really-reaaalllly need to spend the next few months growing up.", "Definitely YTA. I can't see that your cousin did absolutely anything wrong in this situation. She even apologized. I don't really get what your issue was with her? If you were mad that the info got leaked before you wanted it to, that makes sense, but then be mad at your mom for not being able to  keep her mouth shut.  \n\n\nBTW, why does your husband's family know but yours doesn't?", "Never share a secret unless you\u2019re prepared for others to know.", "YTA, your cousin was sending you love and being happy for you. How was she to know that she wasn\u2019t supposed to know? You should be taking issue with your mother for spilling the tea. I hope you apologise to your cousin because she didn\u2019t deserve that.", "YTA", "First of all, congratulations! This is an exciting time for you and I hope the journey is safe, healthy, and joyous.  \nSecond, YTA. You were so rude to a person who was just trying to connect with you at what she thought was an appropriate time. She had no idea you didn't want other to know, and it's not her fault your mom told your aunt. Presumably, you told your mom you didn't want anyone else to know, which is why you're upset, and understandably so, but absolutely at the wrong person.  \n The mature and adult way of handling this would have been to say 'thank you so much, I'd prefer to announce it in my own time so let's keep it between us for now, please.'", "YTA. Should have just taken the congratulations and left things as is and/ or let her know that you are still keeping things private and would appreciate her discretion. You can still announce it on social media. She didn't post it and just reached out privately. There was no need to go nuclear.", "YTA, good luck mending that relationship, yikes.", "Hell yeah you were rude and definitely TA. Now if nobody congratulates you in the future you\u2019re going to cry about how nobody cares. You got mad at her for something that your Mom did. You\u2019re childish.", "YTA You were more than a bit rude to her, you were REALLY rude. She didn't do anything wrong. Your mom is the one who blabbed. Then you flat out lied to her.

My cousin and his wife went through a major struggle with fertility and it took them like 10 years to conceive their first child (with fertility treatments). Then about a year later my aunt told my mom that they were expecting a second child and of course, my mother was very excited for them. My mom specifically asked my aunt if this was public knowledge and if she could congratulate them or if she should wait for an announcement. My aunt told her they had already told everyone and it would be fine to say something, so when my cousins wife posted a picture of their son on social media my mother commented something like \"oh he's so cute and btw congrats on baby number 2!\". Almost immediately her comment was deleted and she got a private message from my cousins wife, who was very sweet and polite, basically just saying \"hey I'm so sorry I deleted your comment, but we haven't announced yet and we're not ready to do so but thank you so much for your well wishes!\". My mother felt so terrible for possibly ruining their announcement and apologized profusely, and they felt bad that she was given incorrect information from my aunt when she specifically asked if it was ok to mention it. \n\nAnyway, that's my long story about how situations like this should be handled with grace.

Unfortunately, I miscarried fairly early on, and it was doubly devastating because I'd lost another pregnancy prior to my son that was ectopic, so it was really hitting me hard. We hadn't told anyone I was pregnant, but we let close family members know when I miscarried just so people would understand why I was being distant. Just a couple weeks later, my husband's sister called via video chat to announce that she was pregnant. I was equal parts devastated and angry. She *knew* I'd just lost a pregnancy.

I didn't expect her to hold in her excitement for my sake, but why put me in a situation where I was forced into being on camera? From my perspective, it was thoughtless... From hers, she was just trying to share her happiness.

We're not telling anyone until 12 weeks. But thanks!\"* I don't get the reasoning behind lying.\n\nShe probably doesn't even care whether or not you're pregnant, TBH.

They didn't announce it on social media until she was 5 months. With their second, they did the same thing. Unfortunately, not all of the parents kept it confidential and the info was passed to my mother, who told me. I texted congratulations to my nephew and niece-in-law.
