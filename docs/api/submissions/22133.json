{"id": 22133, "submission_id": "14yqnkk", "title": "AITA for not giving my girlfriend (25f) my dinner after I had already bought her dinner?", "selftext": "My girlfriend (25F) and I (29M) live in NYC and there's a popular app where you buy leftover restaurant food. Restaurants advertise \"surprise bags\" at a reduced price in order to reduce foodwaste. The customer doesn't know what they're getting until they pick the food up, but the cost at least 3x lower than the normal menu price. (EG if an entree is usually $24, the restaurant is allowed to charge $8 at most for it.) These are hit or miss - sometimes you get exactly what you want at a greatly reduced price, but sometimes you get something that you otherwise wouldn't have picked from the menu.\n\nI ordered a surprise bag from a barbecue place that I was picking up on the way home yesterday. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one but she said no, she wasn't in the mood for barbecue. However, there was an indian restaurant right next door that also had surprise bags available on the app, so she ordered one of them. The barbecue was $12 and the indian food was $10.\n\nWhen I get home I unpack the meals to see what we got. I was psyched about my bag. Since I paid $12 I knew the value had to be at least $36, but honestly the platter looked a lot more expensive. This was a hit. (Keep in mind that we live in the west village, which is the most expensive neighborhood in the most expensive city in the US, so $36 for one meal is pretty typical.) There were burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad, bread, onions, and pickles.\n\nMy girlfriend, however, was  less lucky. Her surprise bag only had 6 different types of soup, half of them being variations on cauliflower soup. She was disappointed to say the least. She asked if we should share my barbecue and I said no, i'm hungry, I offered to buy you some already and you said no, so I'm going to devour it.\n\nShe got mad and called me the asshole. I told her if she didn't want soup she should have ordered something specifically instead of using the surprise bag app. I then told her to just order something off a food delivery app. She said she didn't want to spend the money (another bit of context is I make a lot more money than her and pay all of our rent, I know she's running a bit of a lean financial picture right now.) I then tell her that if she doesn't want to pay for delivery, I'll walk to the bodega on our street and can buy her something there. (Another bit of context is that we live on a 4th floor walkup with no elevator and she broke her leg in a car accident a month ago, so it can be tough for her to get around.) She says she the grill is probably off there and all she wants is a hot meal. I tell her she has soup.\n\nAnyway, she thinks I'm the asshole. But in my defense:\n\n(1) I offered to buy her barbecue to begin with, which she declined.\n\n(2) she picked out her own food and I grabbed it for her on my way home\n\n(3) when she wasn't satisfied, I suggested two solutions (either ordering something from an app or going to a bodega)\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689268641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yqnkk/aita_for_not_giving_my_girlfriend_25f_my_dinner/", "score": 3753, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Prices for surprise bags vary based on location", "Ok, YTA. Hear me out. Based on the principle, you are technically in the right. You both gambled, she happened to lose. However, you're in a (presumably) loving relationship with this woman. She politely declined and took her own route to eat. It's not like she expected you to go out of your way to go to a different place. When she hit zilch on her bag and you hit gold, that's prime time to pool the meals and divide them up a bit to help her get some good food. She can't function at full capacity with a broken leg, and didn't demand your food either. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour response? Forgive me if I editorialize but to me you seemed like a snarling animal wrapping your arms around your food and baring your teeth. \"Tough luck\" is not an appropriate response in a relationship. If you were friends, I'm with you. But she has a broken leg, she asked nicely, she got totally screwed, and you have an excess. You're absolutely an asshole for refusing to share, it's just not cool.", "YTA. Come on man. You both did the surprise bags, hers didn\u2019t work out. You know she can\u2019t afford to order something else but didn\u2019t offer to help pay, you offered her crappy bodega food instead. You could have at least split the barbecue and ordered something else to share and split the price. If the situations were reversed and you\u2019d gotten a bunch of crap soup while she had a feast, would you really want to sit there hungry waiting for some crappy alternative while she chowed down?\n\nYou\u2019re going to get lots of N T A that just have no concept of\u2026being nice and making small sacrifices  for your partner. You and them seem like the types who if their meal companion gets the wrong meal at a restaurant and has to wait half an hour for a new one, they\u2019ll sit there and eat and not even offer a fry.", "NAH, but I'd have shared the barbecue with my SO if she got a gallon of cauliflower soup and I got multiple sides and courses. Actions like that send a different message.\n\nHonestly the whole thing reads as fake, I find it hard to believe that somebody would make a post describing how much extra food they got and that their SO is physically and financially limited and refuse to share what you describe yourself as a lot of food.", "NTA. But I wouldn\u2019t date someone like you", "She had a lot of soups, you had a lot of meats, you could have both just shared and had a good variety. But no, you just had to be a greedy little pig.

Technically NTA- but then the rules are established if she ever has anything good that you want. A healthy relationship involves give and take and being considerate of others, and you weren\u2019t too considerate here. You could\u2019ve been an awesome boyfriend and shared with her. You prioritized yourself completely. \n\nSo NTA in a technical sense but not the most sensitive or considerate boyfriend award winner either.", "Technically NTA. But in a relationship. YTA. If you ever plan on getting married you might want to reconsider when to be selfish and when not to be. \n\nI had to go back to check you wrote GF and not wife. A loving husband would share. Regardless of whether his wife had previously said no. She obviously didn\u2019t expect 3 variations of cauliflower soup.", "I honestly can't imagine telling my wife essentially, \"tough shit\" in this scenario as you did with your GF.  \n\nWere you technically correct?  Perhaps, but you could have shared something with someone you allegedly care about.   \n\nYTA.", "I mean you did ask her if she wanted BBQ and she said no. You are technically right. But if it were me, I\u2019d share with my gf, especially if she had a broken leg. Why not?", "I mean, it's being kinda petty.  Were you mad at her prior to this? There has to be more to it. It's not even whether YTA or not. It is just petty. I don't get the difference . Ifyou were willing to walk down the stairs to get her something else , then why not just share some. The two just don't go together. I feel you are not telling the true full story.", "If we are going to be pedantic you are N T A, but in a more real-life practical sense\u2026 YTA massively. She\u2019s your girlfriend, and the platter that you described could easily be shared by two people with leftovers to spare. Is $6 of barbecue worth your relationship with your significant other? Wild.", "NTA, but I probably would have shared and stolen some soup because I\u2019m all about some soup from Indian restaurants, and the amount of food you got sounds like enough for two people.", "Technically NTA but if this was me I'd just share all the food and have an awesome BBQ soup platter with my bae\n\nYou did offer a few options to your credit but to be like NO you made your bed and now you lay in it, to your gf who sounds like she is going through it, 100%  definitely makes you an asshole", "You may win the battle but lose the war. You are treating her like a flat mate or just another friend instead of someone you are in a relationship with. I don't see why you could not join your two meals and share.", "Dude, is she your first or didn't you simply learn yet to chose between being right and your relationship?", "I think *technically* NTA. You did offer a lot of other options.\n\nBut we have the same app here called TooGoodToGo and if this happened my fianc\u00e9 would be like \u201call soup? That\u2019s crazy. Do you want some of this instead?\u201d Because soup is a kind of starter thing round here and not very filling usually. He wouldn\u2019t sit and eat his whole bag by himself while I had some soup.", "I mean, if this were a math exercise you'd seem reasonable. But she's your girlfriend, dude. A person. \n\nA little kindness doesn't hurt, and you, my dude, are not kind. It costs nothing to compromise and make someone's day a little brighter. Especially someone you're in a relationship with and (should) claim to love. \n\nSo sure, on a technicality you're NTA, but let's be honest, in reality, yeah, YTA.", "It sounds like there was a ton of food in your bag, you could have given her some. But also a bag of various Indian soups sounds delicious.", "i feel like you\u2019re arguing about who is RIGHT when the KIND thing to do would be to share since she\u2019s your SO and has a broken leg and didn\u2019t intend to just get a bunch of soup\u2026if even an acquaintance of mine and i did this for meals and they ended up with the shitty bag i would offer to share because, ya know, i\u2019m nice. \n\nso even if you\u2019re technically right, you\u2019re not being nice. so YTA.", "So, NTA, as is your right. But my husband would so totally give me some of his BBQ and have some of the soup. My husband is awesome to me and I appreciate him everyday in the ways that matter to him, too. We are best friends. When you love someone, you share b/c it makes the other person happy and shows you appreciate them.", "NTA, but I wouldn't have hesitated to share with someone I care about.  Do you actually care about your girlfriend?", "I'm gonna go NTA - BUT...big but; it's your GF dude.  Have one of her soups and share your BBQ.  You look like a great guy and all you have to so is eat some soup and share a couple of ribs.  Win win.", "YTA. I would be on your side if this was a traditional ordering experience, but it's luck of the draw that you got better food than her. Hell, even if my partner knew what they were ordering, but it turned out not good, I would still share mine.", "Wtf is a surprise bag & how can I get one?", "NAH this is one of those situations where you should ignore who is right and do what\u2019s better for your relationship rather than punishing your currently immobile gf for having terrible luck with an Indian giving a terrible selection. \n\nSurely you could have split both the bbq and the Indian, each eaten a decent amount of food and both been happy", "If this were a coworker or a roommate\u2014NTA. \n\nBut this is your *girlfriend.* Your girlfriend dealing with financial insecurity and a broken leg. \n\nYou\u2019re getting all hung up on \u201cthe principle of the thing\u201d and forgetting that you\u2019re supposed to care about this person and their well-being and happiness. And in this case where those things would cost you nothing but sharing the two meals between you so you both eat a decent dinner\u2014YTA. \n\nI hope you find it within yourself to be less selfish for her sake. Or that she finds someone who actually cares about her.", "NAH...I would ask to share if all I got was soup as well, wouldn't you? Even if you don't have to, would it have been so difficult to share?  Stuff like this will come back to haunt you.", "Technically not aholey, but maybe morally a tiny teeny bit aholey. It would not have hurt to share a bit, considering the amount of food you got. I would still be frustrated considering she had already refused it and it sounds absolutely delish, but it would just be a kinder thing to do. She sounds miserable stuck in a wheelchair and even though you are correct on principle, I think allowances could have been made.\n\nLast week I sat down to dinner with my husband and I had spent a long time cooking his favourite dish. It had been a long week and we were both exhausted. I went to put vinegar on my fries and the stopper came out and flooded my meal, completely flooding it and ruining it. I drenched everything. Inedible. He absolutely insisted we spilt his meal because he didn't want me to be sad and hungry even though It was my fault. It reminded me what good heart he has and why I love him so much.", "Also...the Indian restaurant is also the AH", "YTA - I can't imagine not wanting to share with my husband if his meal was disappointing and mine was awesome, and I know he'd do the same for me. It's called being nice. Applying this kind of black-and-white transactional fairness to your SO is just weird.", "Ultimately I\u2019m going to say NTA since you both chose your food, but I kind of question how much you care about her when she got a bunch of cauliflower soup and you hit the jackpot with an amazing bbq feast and you didn\u2019t want to share - not \u201cweren\u2019t willing\u201d but \u201cdidn\u2019t want\u201d", "This app sounds amazing. At first I was like ew but now realizing maybe someone ordered food and didn\u2019t pick it up or the food was burnt (like you said)", "As a whole - NTA\n\nAs a boyfriend...like holy shit dude pick your battles.\n\nBest case was you express sympathy over her luck and just order something she likes - with your money - you'd get paid back at some point.\n\nNext best was Favour for a favour - obviously limited regarding the leg but you could've been like \"fine we can share but (chore) is yours\" \n\nYou won a battle but you lost a war here man.", "I meaaaaan do you want to be right or do you want to be in a relationship? I wouldn't really be too stuck up on what's the right whatever and would have just shared because I care about my partner even if they're being a little unreasonable because I know someday I'll be unreasonable and they'd do the same for me.\n\nYTA", "Soft YTA.  Think about if it was the other way round. \n\nMature relationships are all about compromise, respect, and caring about the other person. A good compromise would have been if both of you shared all of the food since there was plenty of it.", "Yep, YTA. \n\nThe amount of people on Reddit who think \"being nice to your partner\" = \"being fucked over\" is **wild.**", "INFO: do you like your girlfriend?", "NTA but I would have gave her some anyway.", "YTA you got a ton of food for very little money, you easily could\u2019ve shared, especially seeing as it\u2019s your significant other, i would\u2019ve in a second for my boyfriend.", "Yeah she made a bad decision. But she's your girlfriend. YTA", "Eh, you could have given her a small bit of the BBQ. I have ordered from that app and gotten some meals that are good and some that are garbage. If this happened with my partner we would share.", "YTA.  \nJust because if you got the short end of the stick, how would you want your girlfriend to treat you? would you just accept all that soup or would you want to at least trade a bit?", "Ugh light ESH. I went on a 10 hour car trip with my boyfriend and stopped at Sheetz (gas station that has a full menu of made to order fast food). We discussed that their fried food gives me tummy troubles which wasn\u2019t a good idea for the remaining 5 hour car ride so I tried chicken breast in a wrap instead of tendies. I spit it out it was so awful and I just had to sit there looking sad. I didn\u2019t want to waste time going back in and I had lost my appetite. My boyfriend gave me his grilled cheese that he ordered for himself. He didn\u2019t have to do that and I declined at first because it was half of his lunch. But he insisted, lovingly, and made sure I was taken care of and had food because traveling is stressful and we\u2019re and team working together to love and care for each other. \n\nHe gave me that $3 sandwich a year ago and I still think of how kind it was and how he really didn\u2019t need to do that. I left so loved and thought of with that gesture. \n\n\nSo would you like to be right or would you like your gf to think on what a loving caring partner she has?", "NTA but GAF (Greedy as F...) dude you couldn\u2019t share food with your girl? Even a little. Some bbq for some soup? \u201cBut I followed the rules\u201d can\u2019t wait to hear how that bites you in the ...", "I see both sides. She was offered food, said no, picked her own food, was unsatisfied and then wanted the food she turned down in the first place. That's her own problem. HOWEVER - in a relationship, I would have probably shared that and then went to get some snacks or something for the night. I'm gonna say NTA  but you could have (if you wanted) gone the extra step and gave her a little of your food.", "I guess technically NTA, but idk man\u2026\u2026it sounds like your BBQ was a ton of food. If my partner and I ended up in that situation, he wouldn\u2019t even think twice about sharing some of his (if it is in fact a pretty large amount of food) or offering to have us both have some of each if he saw I was disappointed and knew I was having a rough time lately. But maybe he\u2019s an outlier, and I have a complex about being a burden to people and would never ask him to share anyway lol. I wouldn\u2019t think twice about doing the same for him.\n\nIt just seems like the naturally kind and caring thing to do for a partner going through it. I can understand if you were starving and it was really only enough to be satisfying for one person tho.", "Technically? NTA. But you could have split both meals between the two of you.  \n\nI\u2019d be chapped too, if I got 3 versions of the same thing.", "YTA. Sometimes when I\u2019m frustrated with my partner, a quick read of AITA reminds me how lucky I am to have such a caring, compassionate human being. \n\nI don\u2019t care about technical right or wrongs. If my partner was laid up with a broken leg and got a bunch of soup (because come on, what\u2019s the likelihood of getting a bunch of soup from an Indian restaurant), I\u2019d share based on the fact that I love him. And he would do the same for me. \n\nLittle kindnesses are so lost on people, it\u2019s sad.", "\u201cThere were burnt ends\u2026.\u201d And goes on to describe all the mass amount of food within your score. YTA. You had plenty to share but chose to be an A and make some point instead. As others have said - you could have chosen to be kind but you chose to be a d instead. \nVerdict YTA", "Info. Has she shared her winning surprise food with you before? Would she?", "She is low on money\nShe broke her leg\nShe didn't refuse barbecue to piss you off. She just wanted something else and got bad luck.\nShe didn't order soup as you implied. I wouldn't expect soup if I order indian food. \n\nAlas, she seems to be in real bad luck having you as a boyfriend, too. I could never enjoy a good meal seeing someone hungry by my side. \n\nYou weren't obligated to share, but having no empathy and acting like she was being a brat when she problably just didn't want to waste more food and money is an a-hole move.", "Idk why this dinner of surprise food has to be a life lesson? Technically NTA but you\u2019re still an asshole in general cuz wtf man it\u2019s ur girlfriend not like a roommate or something", "I've never been in that exact situation, but often we will take home leftovers from dinner.  Sometimes we'll joke about taking each other's leftovers for lunch the next day.  But my husband always reminds me that if I want it, I can have it.  Because \"I love you more than leftover ribs.\"  (or whatever.)   That's probably why we're approaching 40 years married.  I'm guessing you don't love your girlfriend more than barbecue, and now she knows it as well.", "Very weak and tepid NTA.\n\nJust t because you're not an asshole doesn't mean it wasn't a bit of a dick move. You shouldn't mind sharing with your partner. You're supposed to bring each other up. \n\nI don't know if I support her being mad at you and everything... But if she looked at you a little differently after this, I can definitely understand that.", "NTA, but damn dude, you can be right and dead, so share the food.", "Is this the kind of relationship you want to have?  Really? \n\nOf course you should have shared. \n\nYTA.", "NTA definitely!", "ESH. But a caring partner would have share some no matter what.", "YTA, a bit. \n\nYou don't owe her BBQ, but it wouldn't have done any harm to share. You could have split both or ordered something else to be delivered to help supplement the BBQ. \n\nI would also just feel plain bad for my husband if I got BBQ, and he got a bunch of crappy soups. I'd offer to share, even if I really didn't want to. I feel like he'd do the same. It'd be different if she picked a bunch of soup and then changed her mind, but.. she had no way of knowing.", "YTA dude. You are technically correct but personally an asshole.", "YTA - you said it looked like over $36 worth of food and you can\u2019t share with your injured girlfriend? \nYou making more money or paying rent etc. doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s just about being nice to people sometimes lol", "Kinda TA. You should have shared both meals. Is it that much skin off your nose? Makes it seem like you are selfish and not in partnership.", "NTA...

I can\u2019t understand how this is the hill you choose to die on", "Kind of stuck on this one\u2026 so I\u2019ll just say im not like you. I couldn\u2019t sit there and enjoy a meal while my wife, my kids, my friends, or anyone really was hungry. I simply don\u2019t have it in me. Sounded like you had plenty to share and if you didn\u2019t you could\u2019ve employed the same solutions you gave her as a way to get more food.", "YTA. You said it yourself, it's hit or miss with that app. THIS time you got lucky and she didn't, but you're acting as if she knowingly made a bad choice. You keep saying that you offered to buy her a mystery bag from the BBQ place and that it's her fault that she declined, but how was she supposed to know? \n\nI've ordered from that app (if it's the one I think it is) numerous times with my husband and like you said, sometimes it's great and sometimes it's crappy, but it would never even cross my mind to stuff my face with delicious food while my husband is stuck with couliflour soup.", "I get not wanting to share but when you\u2019re in a relationship sometimes you do these things for the person you\u2019re in a relationship with.

Yes she\u2019s not being \u201cfair\u201d but that also doesn\u2019t really matter, being polite and kind sometimes isn\u2019t totally fair. Her order seems like it REALLY sucked, like not just not exactly what she wanted but really off base, giving her a little of your massive order would be the kind thing to do. She is struggling financially, has a broken leg from a car accident, and just got a gallon of cauliflower soup. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to give her a rib.", "YTA. \n\nLitigating who is entitled to what based on what they selected and paid for is beside the point. You're in a relationship.

I lean more to your side though bc you offered multiple solutions to the issue.\n\nP.S. I love TGTG i use it all the time! Just got a bag from a bagel place yesterday and they gave me an extra bag bc someone didn\u2019t pick up one that was paid for, so now me, my fam, and gfs fam all wound up with like 15 bagels each.", "YTA Lol imagine not just splitting both bags. \"Sorry all you got was hot sauce from the mexican place, I'm gonna eat these sandwiches all by myself sucks to suck!\"", "Yeah YTA. She's got a broken leg, probably feeling helpless, cranky and in a lot of pain on top of being hangry and disappointed with her surprise bag being nothing but multiple soups.

Haha", "Are we the only people that just go to the jar of peanut butter or a can of soup if things don't work out for dinner? \n\nSo many issues over food that can be solved by a simple sandwich or soup. \n\nOr by just being a caring partner. \nYTA for not sharing.", "YTA - bro this is your **partner**. Neither of you knew what you would get and she got a bad draw. How hard is it to say \"You have some BBQ and I'll eat some soup\". Instead you basically said \"sucks to suck, get your own\". If you don't have her back on something as elementary as this what are you guys even doing.", "YTA. You had a huge platter would it kill you to share? You sound like a very transactional partner. Ugh.", "YTA. That platter sounds easily able to feed two people. Why are you even with someone you value less than half a bbq platter???", "NTA. That's the risk you run with a mystery order. \nIf you WANT to, sure share.  But you're not wrong for not sharing either.", "NTA.  Everybody takes their chances. This is like asking your partner if they want to order something,  say no and then they pick food from your plate.", "Yeah bro YTA, just give your girl some of your food and suck it up for another day you won\u2019t starve.", "NTA.

He expects her to sit there and choke down 2 gallons of soup like some reverse Oliver Twist shit. Nobody wants that much soup in one sitting", "My family and I do the same. Sometimes we each get a different meal and share it.", "My SO gets disappointed if I don't try his meal. We had to establish a first bite rule. If it's your dish you take the first bite, then I'll try it.", "Hahahahaha \nOmg, he is autarky.\n\nWe are not at full food communism but definitely the one before that. \n\nThank you for sharing!!!", "This exactly. Something a bit similar happened with me and my partner, and she tried giving me all her food. Two people that love each other are supposed to take care of each other.", "I'm with you here. When I was a kid, adult relatives consistently took food off my plate without asking (despite their own full plates). I grew up in a solidly working class family that didn't have much in the way of extras. My dad always got the largest share of the food.\n\nThat said I've shared food with others because it was my choice to do so. But for others to *expect* me to share my food isn't appropriate.", "I don\u2019t even have a broken leg and my boyfriend would never do this to me. Honestly the second he saw a bunch of soup in my bag he\u2019d have been offering me BBQ.", "\"hey remember that time all I got was soup and you wouldn't split dinner with me and you actually went online to ask randos if you were the asshole?\"\n\nThis would totally still be a funny memory", "BINGO. Not all battles are worth it. That\u2019s good advice for all of life.", "Now there's a good boy.", "If two bags of BBQ showed up, which belongs to which person? There'd just be two bags full of random stuff, they could easily split them anyway that was reasonable.", "I was agreeing with the point above and putting the same idea in different words.\n\nI guess I needed to put \"yes and\" at the top if that was not obvious. \n\nThe \"you\" here who gambled and won was OP.\n\nYou seem to be neither the OP nor the person I'm replying to?", "Correct\n\nPartners are partners for a reason. You're on the same team. Act like it", "Thanks for the recap - that was def. not the same case as here", "One of my biggest pet peeves is telling someone, \"I plan on leaving at x time,\" and having them drag their feet.\n\nI am not a morning person. I do not like getting up early. But when I have to drive for 8 hours to get to a destination, I want to be out the door BEFORE FIVE AM. No \"early\" not \"in the morning.\" I want to drive in darkness for at least an hour. That way, I avoid all the city traffic and hit the open road at a nice hour.\n\nI have several developmental disabilities. But I still set god damned alarms and make sure I get up in time for whatever the plans are.", "Oh man I'd have left too. Disrespecting time is a big deal for me. I had a friend that always expected everyone to cater to her time line even if we had plans to meet for a specific time. I used to live down the street from her so she would expect me to hang out and wait for her to get ready while going for a smoke every 5 minutes, stopping to make a snack, make a drink.. just whatever she felt like doing.\n\nI left her a few times because it would get me so pissed off.", "Yeah, the moment where she ordered food *after she was already late* is where I would have bailed on her. That's some serious passive-aggressive BS going on there. Does she hate the brother? Or the brother's SO?", "I didn't even see that post and I wholeheartedly agree with you.", "This sounds like a passive-aggressive power play to me.   I'd advise considering getting out of the relationship.", "Yeah, I know this sub has a no relationship rule anyways, but god the response some relationship posts lately get before they're closed floors me.", "I don't know if this is sad or not, but we'd probably go back and forth. Lol with me telling him it's ok, I know he's looking forward to it, it's my own fault, etc. And him replying that it's too much food for just him, and he wants to try some soup so it's only fair to share his food with me. Then I'll cave because I know he really wants me to enjoy the food WITH him. Not have me watch him sadly from my cauliflower soup corner.", "I'm about to cook my mom her favorite meal for dinner, which I do once a week, just because it makes her so happy. I don't know why so many people would rather be right than do things to make the people they're supposed to love smile.", "The sweet spice of victory!", "Right?! This could have been a cute and funny story, the night of the assorted cauliflower soups! Something funny to laugh about together whenever you see cauliflower soup on a menu, hey babe, remember that night we split your BBQ \u2018cause I wound up with a five gallon bucket\u2019s worth of cauliflower soup?!", "I'm now more concerned about how the fuck OP managed to eat ALL of that food.", "This is true. And he even said  \"I'm not even sorry\"\n\nJoey deserved to end up alone", "And let's not forget how he wouldn't share Hugsy!!!", "I was on crutches and a scooter. When my spouse was rude I would jab him with the crutch or accidentally cruise into him with my scooter. He has that for 6months.", "No but she can shove the crutch up his ass.", "it is for couples that actually care for each other.", "It is normal. Normal people share lol", "Ha! That\u2019s what I said. YTA JOEY. \n\nLoving couples share food and take risks together.", "Yea. I'm super confused bout the soup myself. Like... Sure it's a good deal but surely they realize people are doing this for dinner? A selection of slightly different soups is not a dinner", "Nope, I just misread your comment and that's on me, my apologies.", "You're welcome! Usually I'm not up for writing a wall of text, but I couldn't believe how much he was misrepresenting that story. Lol", "I'm not a morning person either so I set my alarm for at least 2 hours before I have to leave. I have ADD, so I try & get everything ready to go the night before & still find stuff in the morning that I forgot about the night before.", "I had a friend like this, too\u2026she was always either extremely late or took two-three hours to get ready while she FaceTimed, texted, slowly did hair and makeup, etc. It was so frustrating and rude. And if we went somewhere, I\u2019d either have to wait until she was ready to leave or leave without her (but if it was the other way around, she wouldn\u2019t wait for me.) She turned out to be a very selfish friend, anyway, so eventually I just stopped hanging out with her. I can\u2019t stand it when people waste my time.", "There was speculation in the comments that she was trying to waste time, so that by the time they finally arrived the party would be have half way over. Then she would only have to stay for a couple of hours instead of five or six.  I don't know if there were any follow-ups by the OP though.", "I think it's lots of young guys who are upset that they don't have a girlfriend to share dinner with and just want to bask in their anger.", "Yes! That's exactly how I'm imagining this because my partner and I actually like each other and would have laughed while stuffing our faces with soup and BBQ.", "I read \u201cjab him in the crotch.\u201d \ud83d\ude05", "I may get flak for this but how is OP entirely in the wrong?? The gf said she precisely she didn\u2019t want bbq so he obliged and you can\u2019t fault him for that; words mean things. He then offered multiple compromises after that all of which she declined so the gf was also being difficult. As such this should at least be ESH. \n\nAlso worth pointing out that if the genders were reversed people would probably be nowhere near as harsh on OP.", "In that case, just drive seperate or make a plan. \n\nMy husband is way more social than I am. I like to be around friends, but once I'm done I want to go home. We account for that by driving seperate to things that are all day events.", "I gotta say - there would have been some teasing about the soup before she got any BBQ.  But yeah - good-natured teasing and cauliflower soup jokes for years."]}
