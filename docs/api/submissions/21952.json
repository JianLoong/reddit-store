But I need to know if I'm actually wrong. My husband is legitimately the baby of the family. He's 28 (the youngest). He has 2 sisters and a brother (all older) and none of them have kids. There's no extended family (most have passed). I (29f) came in to the relationship with 3 kids and I'm currently pregnant with my husband's first baby and the families first baby in 28 years. \n\nNow one of my SILs and mt BIL are the worst when it comes to calling my husband and asking for handouts. In the past 6 years that I've been around, my husband has been called at least once a week to help someone out. Whether it be helping people move, helping out financially, babysitting dogs, giving people rides, etc etc etc. Over the past 6 years we have extended our handouts as much as $21k and much more in labor/\"delivery\" and whenever they say they will pay us back, they never do. The ONLY one I can understand is my BIL, who is currently in prison. We give him commissary money or gifts sent but that's whatever. However, about 6 months ago I told my husband either we stop helping his family or I'm done. We have a baby on the way and I'm utterly repulsed by his family mooching off of us. He agreed and he started saying no everytime they asked for anything and eventually the calls stopped coming in.\n\nWell, last weekend my SIL called and asked us to come over with the kids because it was my youngest son's birthday and they \"had gifts\" for him. We show up and they give my son a pair of goggles (the $1 ones from dollar general) and a cupcake. Both SILs (+ their husbands) and MIL was there. They didn't even say happy birthday to my kid. Well, when the kids went outdoors they cornered us and started talking about how the family needed to \"band together\" to help SIL save her house because she couldn't pay her land tax ($1500) and said \"how much can you contribute?\" I immediately got pissed and my husband grabbed my arm and said \"don't\". But they kept pressing about how everyone needed to help and how THEY (all of them) were all broke. So I honestly snapped and said \"you guys are nothing but a bunch of fucking mooches\" and walked out, getting my kids and getting them in the car. My husband is pissed I said anything because he told me \"don't\" and I disrespected him.\n\nETA: I make more than my husband does, by almost $15k. And no, he wasn't holding up his end of the deal either. He was asking them how much they needed. Therefore he fully intended on helping them, which would have come out of our shared savings. He's made it clear to me several times that he doesn't want to help them. He will bitch at me for weeks following him being \"forced\" or \"cornered\" in to helping, so I become the emotional bag he uses to decompress. So no, he doesn't want to help. He just has issue with saying no because he's a people pleaser. He'd rather take it out on me later because that's apparently easier for him.", "created_utc": 1689088544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wu40b/aita_for_calling_my_husbands_family_a_bunch_of/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The requests for money won't stop because your husband can't say NO.", "NTA OP. Divorce that loser and his loser family.", "NTA. Looks like it\u2019s time for you to open a separate savings account under your name only. Maybe once it\u2019s only his money being drained to fund his families bs he\u2019ll get a bigger backbone to stand up against them.", "NTA\n\nTime to have a separate account. All of your money goes into that account and then ypu transfer money into the joint account the day that the bills are due.\n\nLet him pay out of his own pocket.", "You are NTA but his family are.  Do not give one more cent or lift a finger to help them.  They are adults so can look after themselves.  You are right they are mooching and will keep doing it so long as someone caved in and gives them what they want.  I\u2019d personally go no contact until every cent they owe you is paid back.", "Nta. I really hope you guys have separate finances. Honestly I would have an account and give him a page with everything that\u2019s needed for the house like rent, bills, what\u2019s going to cost for daycare for the baby. And just let him know that if he wants to help his family that\u2019s his problem. But he needs to pay his share of the households first and if he wants to use his free money that\u2019s his problem  but if he needs help in the future financially your not giving it because he is making bad financial decisions. Or you can leave that\u2019s fair too. His family isn\u2019t going to change and he is always going to enable them and you already saw that. So yeah I wouldn\u2019t blame you for putting yourself and the kids first.", "NTA, at all.  Your in-laws lured you over to their house under false pretenses just to beg for money.  Not cool!  If you don't put a stop to this, it will never end.", "NTA\n\nI have more of a concern with the fact that he takes his anger out on you when it should be directed at his mooch family.\n\nHe may be a people pleaser but he doesn't seem to want to please you, who should be his priority. Leave him and see how well he helps his family w/o your wages.", "Keep your finances separate or kiss your money goodbye. You have your kids to worry about. NTA", "I would have reminded them what they owe and when that paid up then they could look into loaning them money. Especially since you now have a baby on the way.", "If you're not done now, the next time it happens the answer is to take off your wedding band and tell them they can pawn it to cover whatever they need since you won't be using it anymore.", "NTA.  He can sell a Harley and help them. These people are adults, they can figure it out themselves.", "Girl..you know you're NTA here. You are fed up and you should be!!! His family is AWFUL and he isn't much better honestly.\n\n\nYou make more money than him. Get a separate account he can't touch. If he wants to help so bad then he can sell his expensive toys to help his family! Not giving handouts to his family.\n\nPut your foot down, you have a baby on the way! The family will continue to act this way until you and your cowardly husband set boundaries and/or cut the purse strings.\n\nGood luck OP, don't deal with these BS moochers anymore.", "Girl, you need separate accounts. As long as your savings are mixed up and he has expensive hobbies, and he has access to cash that came from *your* hard work, you'll always have this point of conflict. If your money is safely in your name, then when he wants to give them money you can emotionally detach and say, \"that's your choice. Do *you* have enough money in *your* account?\"\n\nEdit: typo", "Separate finances op NOW. NTA.\n\n\nHe needs to put equal income part  in a joint account with you to pay for necessities and to only remain with his 'fun' money for his hobbies and relatives. Once he will feel the burden of not being able to enjoy his hobbies he ll have incentive to stop saying 'yes' when asked.", "I can see why you were annoyed and said what you said.", "That's a BS statement from him. His giving into them is affecting your marriage and your financial situations. He is setting himself AND YOU on fire to keep his family warm,", "Bot: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wu40b/comment/jrjp2xc/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "Op knows him and said he asked how much as he intended to give the money from their (her s too) savings as he doesn't make enough to be able to pay for his hobbies and help his family."]}
