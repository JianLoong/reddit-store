Victoria and I have never been close, but we\u2019re civil. Our relationship took dips when we met our respective partners (we both met them through each other, sort of, and there was a lot of kerfuffle each time), but we\u2019ve since repaired that.\n\nThat said, I was surprised when she asked me to be a bridesmaid. I didn\u2019t really want to, since I live far away and I\u2019m busy in the couple of months leading up to the wedding but I was so surprised that she asked and thought maybe she didn\u2019t have anyone else to ask (since she didn\u2019t even seem that pleased about it) so I said yes.\n\nA few days ago Victoria, her mother, the other bridesmaids, and I, went shopping for the bridesmaid dresses. Victoria was awful to me the whole time. She accused me of choosing dresses to try on to spite her and upstage her (I didn\u2019t pick any of the dresses, her mother and MoH did) and every dress I tried on she nitpicked my appearance in it and made it the reason she didn\u2019t want to pick that dress. When one of the sales assistants brought out a dress Victoria started crying, saying she didn\u2019t want to see me in that dress on her wedding day. I was getting a bit fed up and I was still jetlagged so I pulled her aside and asked if she\u2019d rather I just not be a bridesmaid. I said I\u2019d be happy to help with planning in any way I could but I didn\u2019t want her worried or this upset about bridesmaid dresses. Victoria then snapped that she needed me as a bridesmaid because her dad (my stepdad) and Jake wanted me to be one (apparently for the optics since Jake\u2019s sister is also a bridesmaid and we\u2019re both from families who value the \u201cclose knit family\u201d image). Her dad is paying for the wedding. \n\nI just said, great, neither of us wanted me to be a bridesmaid, I\u2019m out. And I left.\n\nVictoria is now blowing up my phone begging me to be a bridesmaid again. Her dad is furious with the way she treated me and how she told me about him wanting me to be a bridesmaid and is now being (according to her) very tight on the purse for the wedding. Apparently she feels that the extended family will also judge her for not having me as a bridesmaid. I told her I\u2019m not doing it, partly because she was awful to me out of resentment for something I didn\u2019t know about, and partly because I never wanted to do it in the first place.

What matters here is obtaining PEACE. For all that is good and holy, bury the hatchet once and for all and stop the triangulation going on! \nYou agreed to be a bridesmaid knowing the interpersonal dynamic between you two. You made an INFORMED decision. You should have let your yes mean yes. In addition, I'm not fooled at all here.. by angrily pulling out, you know that action and conversation would produce dramatic results. After all, you could have chosen to gently pull her aside at another time to ask her what she truly wanted and then had a much healthier conversation. Instead, you contributed to the circumstances where that information was hurled at you.\nYou lack integrity here.\nI'm not justifying her choices at all. But there's an old proverb that says not to be surprised if a nose bleeds after twisting it. You both chose, in your own ways, to twist each other's nose. **You chose to twist hers because you got butt-hurt over your ego/nose getting twisted. You don't get to cry about this because two wrongs don't add up into one right** And now, because this wedding is a FAMILY event, the family is upset. You lost sight of the more important issue: you agreed to a role and are reneging for entirely petty reasons instead of addressing deeper issues like an adult would. That is your grocery cart of items that, yes, maybe everyone had a hand in filling up, but it's still your cart of items you get to pay for. Seriously, grow up.\n**YOU ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO SMOOTH THINGS OUT**, which is your choice to take or not to take. But you **do not** get to whine about the consequences because the consequences affect the entire family and you'll, in turn, receive consequences for your choices. Whatever you choose, only you have the power here to be the **healthy** adult. Once your emotions have calmed down, please offer to take her out for a cup of coffee and have a TACTFUL, GENTLE ,and honest conversation about what you both want moving forward and HOW you both are going to do that. If one of you needs respect, define respect; calling once a week, not talking to Dad about one another, not watching jeopardy together, whatever. Don't take any bait on the conversation developing into another one; keep it on its course. Stop bringing up the past, who said what and when because its also your family's involvement that's keeping you both from establishing your OWN relationship. Yes, I'm sure there's lots of tension caused by past family blending.. get over it. You both are now adults but only you can depend on yourself to act like one.. SO ACT IT. And then, whatever you BOTH agree on, follow through and STOP STOP STOP involving the rest of your family the why's you both choose what you chose. Even if someone lies about it or throws you under a future bus, just pull up your big girl panties, trust in your decisions, and let them deal with it. Just tell whomever that both you girls are at peace with each other and with the decision and let it be at that. Stop letting your family dictate your relationships.\nThat all being said, weddings are a time of high emotions for everyone. I'm sure Dad or Mom will be PISSED at you not being in a matching bridesmaid dress OR you'll hate whom you are paired up with, etc. You might even end up looking like The Bad Guy even if you both decided not to have you in the wedding. It doesn't matter. Again: it doesn't matter. Just shut up about it, nod your head, and be an adult which means PLAY THE LONG GAME.. which is keeping your decision between you both. If your step sister defaults on this by using that mutual decision as a tool to stab you in the back, then that's a deal breaker and I'd (GENTLY) tell her that during the initial conversation (as well as establishing the fact that if you do that to her, it would be a deal breaker for her too) Give her the benefit of the doubt that she wants what you want. After all, she DID ask you to be in the wedding so she wants a \"family\" that includes you to some extent.

If he want to do that just so he can Control her wedding he is an AH. Yes, she doesn't have to accept and I wouldn't.

A parent doing a favor to a child that comes with strings attached is not doing the child a favor. Giving a gift like paying for a wedding then dictating how the wedding should be is not giving a gift its purchasing what you want to happen.\n\n  \nLike seirously bride is 100% TA for how she treated OP. that does not mean that there is not a bigger TA  out there who is the reason that OPs phone is now blowing up and everything else thats going on, because the bride never would have asked to begin with if not for that bigger TA who has to be addressed also at some point, but your rather happy to not have to interact with.  \n\n\nThe bride had a choice, be a good little hooker for daddy and perform how he wanted and get his money, or be honest and loose the money.

She could've told her dad no, but she wanted his money. \n\n Well then she can pay for the wedding herself. Who is stopping her? \n\n Even if op tells stepdad that she doesn't want to be a bridesmaid it won't change a thing. I assume his daughter, the bride, told him that too and it didn't work. You seem to believe that if op says \"i never wanted to be a bridesmaid\" stepdad is gonna say \"okay, daughter take this money now\". He doesn't care about his daughter/stepdaughter's feelings, he just wants his \"perfect family\" to perform the happy family scene."]}
