Set those boundaries!", "\u201cI like being seen as the good guy so I offer nice things then ever say no.\u201d Of course they\u2019ll take advantage: you\u2019re saying yes every time.\n\nDecide your boundaries, make them clear, and know that complaining when you feel overtaxed but dont say no, makes you more of an AH than saying no does.\n\nNAH", "NTA. You are a really good friend! If your friends have any sense at all they\u2019ll graciously accept that their free ride is over and hope that you\u2019ll still want a relationship with their children. Kids need adults in their lives that care about them and set an example of how happiness and success can be found in all different types of living situations (married, single, with or without children). If I were your friend, I\u2019d have my boys make a special day for you to show they appreciate you and your time.", "NTA You're just starting to feel taken advantage of? They are full out taking advantage. Do your own thing. You don't have to always be available for every one of them.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t explain or give a reason, just let them know you can\u2019t or it doesn\u2019t work for you.\n\nIf you want, try to plan things with your friends and their kids so that you still get to see them. If your closer with some of the kids, maybe offer to do something with them (depending on age, etc). Only if you want\u2026.try to shift it to what works for you and more social, not you being the babysitter.\n\nYou are very kind and it went from a kindness to a friend for a night/afternoon to a week with some\u2026.that\u2019s really crazy.", "NTA. Just tell them you're no longer able to do it.  You will likely find out which ones (if any) are really your friends, but wouldn't you want to?", "NTA. Before you say anything to your friends, please think through what boundaries you want to set. How many total hours / days per week would be too much? Will you operate on a first come, first served basis, so one friend can book all of your capacity for themselves? Or do you want to put a cap on what you'll do for any one friend to make sure you have time and energy to help others, too?\n\nIf I was in your shoes, and feeling very run down, I would look at it as needed a respite from providing child care and attempt to recharge as quickly as possible by capping it at no more than four hours per friend and no more than twelve hours total per week. My policy would essentially be \"emergencies only.\" Someone else needs to be their first choice of who to turn to, at least for a while.\n\nYou're not a safe caregiver when you're exhausted and at your wit's end.", "NTA but try to give them a head\u2019s up sooner rather than later, so that they can adjust their expectations and make other plans in plenty of time. \n\nAt least that way, even if they accuse you of leaving them \u201chigh and dry,\u201d you\u2019ll know you did your part in making it a smooth transition. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA even if you stopped babysitting altogether. Unfortunately though, all too often \"no good deed goes unpunished\" and your friends may reflexively react negatively then justify being like that to themselves after the fact -- rather than realizing that while a good thing has come to an end they were never entitled to it in the first place and owe you a debt of gratitude.\n\nAll you can do is tell them in a cushioned way, sandwiching notifying them that the babysitting will be drastically cut down between telling them how much you enjoy being in their lives and want to see the kids in the future -- it's just that you can't always be available and have your own plans. Just to let them know, from now on you can only babysit (insert terms here).\n\nYou will almost certainly get backlash. You may even lose friends -- but those who would react that way mainly see you as a convenient babysitter and/or are so self-involved that they can't see your point of view and aren't good friends to have. If their mindset has ossified into thinking of friends without children as those without lives who are there to help out those with actual lives (parents) then you may want them to just go and piss up a rope anyway.", "NTA. Tell them that you need to focus on your own stuff and no longer have time to help.\n\nI did that with a disabled friend who was getting demanding. I worked remotely and had a flexible job but was suddenly recruited for something paying a lot more but is hybrid and has less flexibility. He tried to guilt me but I'm exhausted from learning the new job and sometimes go straight to bed after work.", "NTA. Oh, I would say you are the opposite of AH. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth having an honest discussion with them about it.  The alternative is that you continue to say yes and feel unappreciated, or you repeatedly say no which could result in a misunderstanding or them thinking that you don\u2019t like their kids.  \n\nYou are certainly not obligated to look after anyone else\u2019s children, so they may be surprised or annoyed by the inconvenience of having to ask someone else to babysit. If they are true friends and you handle the conversation well they shouldn\u2019t be annoyed for long. If you start off with something like. \u2026\u201d You guys obviously know how much I love you and your kiddos. But lately, I\u2019ve been feeling that I haven\u2019t been giving myself enough time or attention. So after whenever, blah, blah, I\u2019m not going to be able to help as much with babysitting.  I can probably help out 1/month or blah blah. I wanted you to know in advance so you weren\u2019t caught off guard later on.\u201d  Or something that acknowledges your affection for them and that this might be a surprise or difficult.  And then go do something to show your self appreciation for being kind to yourself.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA for not wanting to be indefinitely responsible for children who do not belong to you.", "Stop being such a doormat.  You've been taken advantage of for too long.  Charge them for your time and if they protest say 'No.'.", "Just say no. I've never changed a nappy and only babysat a few times. People can get over their entitlement...", "NTA. They are using you. Stop being treated like this and say no. You don\u2019t have to give a reason because if you give one they will try and tell you it\u2019s not good enough and you are horrible for not babysitting. Just say no I can\u2019t.", "NTA. It sounds like you need to set boundaries for your own sake. It\u2019s so kind of you to help and sad theyve now taken that for granted and taken advantage. Maybe say no to all friends for awhile to come back from burnout. If anyone gives you an issue, that\u2019s on them and actually a red flag in the friendship.", "NTA you needed to speak up 10 years ago. I babysit for my friends\u2019 kids and they pay me $100+ per night. Just because you\u2019re a friend doesn\u2019t entitle them to your labor *for free*", "Ok this is very strange.

I just need to stop myself from going to my normal go to yes answer.", "Thanks that's so sweet of you and actually really cheered me up. \u2764\ufe0f I love all the kids, they're literally my favorite people in the world. It's just I can't keep up. There's been a lot of good advice on here which I'm really thankful for xx also if your boys are as kind as you I'd happily be their aunty, so hugs all round from me xx", "Tbh I think this might actually be my best option, these are my friends. They know I'm kinda boring. I don't have a partner in my life currently and my idea of a good time is reading a book which \"I can do while I watch the kids\" \ud83d\ude44 anyone whose been around a child for longer than 10 seconds knows that isn't a possibility.", "I think this is a good idea. I might try floating it out there I'm taking a week to myself at the end of the month (that way they know I'm busy then and unavailable) and then use that time to think and maybe write everything down. My brains a bit hectic at the minute and maybe a week focusing just on my own life might clear my head and make things easier to explain and say without me giving in.", "It's the guilt that grips you! And It's REALLY hard to say no to someone you care about that needs help and to be honest I think that is exhausting in its own right.  \ud83d\ude1e", "It took me 10yrs because I'm stupid but I finally came to the same conclusion. And I get it, they're parents, getting a babysitter is hard and childcare is insanely expensive. I'm the child of a single mum myself so I know how hard it is and believe me it's HARD. I love them and respect them 1000% as mothers but I'm exhausted and overwhelmed. Even decades of friendship isn't overshadowing that fact anymore.", "I've never been paid for watching them, no gifts and other than a few times when I really couldn't afford to pay for the child when out and about with them and they've had to cover money for lunch or sent them with food (London is expensive) no.  Most of my friends are single parents, I didn't feel right asking for money but it's now gotten past the point mentally and to be honest financially I'm not handling it much better.", "You drained because they are draining you. It won't be a bad thing if you lose some. You will have more time to make others.", "This is definitely going to happen to some degree.\n\nConsider planning out how much time you have available to help ahead of time, and going to them with well defined limits, like every Tuesday and Thursday and Saturday mornings, or whatever.   That way it won't feel like a strong rejection to them, or an emotional breakdown from you.  Those are what would most likely trigger a cut.", "It sucks when you figure out people around you aren\u2019t really receptive to you. \n\nTrying to rebuild is really rough.", "But also a big beautiful doormat. Just say no but, maybe give them a bit of notice that your day care is closing. \n\nNTA", "And, I\u2019d suggest, stop assuming that your relationship is based on free childcare.   \n\n\nMaybe charge for babysitting and be friends for free. Those who like that deal are the ones to hang onto. Or explain you\u2019re busy and it babysitting for now, but can come with them to the park for a coffee date while the kids play. No doesn\u2019t require you to anticipate or prevent their reaction.", "Frankly, I think you may be your own worst enemy. Until you can learn to say no and mean it, so you can effectively set and police boundaries, you will find yourself stuck babysitting -- even while feeling run down and wishing you weren't doing so much of it.\n\nI advise bracing yourself and just doing it. The feeling of freedom you get from consistently being able to say no and mean it will have you never wanting to step back into how you were before.", "It sounds like it's multiple demands tho. Not a good situation", "You're 10000% right, I'm there now I just need to take the jump and outrightly say no. I won't lie I'm scared but it's literally at the point I'm making up feeble plans instead of just saying no which is pathetic just to get a little time for myself. It's why I came here. My thoughts were going back and forth between me thinking I just need to balls up and say no to maybe I'm being selfish for not helping my friends when they need it."]}
