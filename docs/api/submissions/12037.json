On the other hand, it's important for you to express your feelings and concerns in a constructive way, rather than being snippy and making accusatory statements.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you and your husband to communicate and find a solution that works for both of you.

I would be annoyed as well if my last day to be able to spend quality time outside of the home with my husband was cut out for last minute plans. My opinion is ESH because you could have handled how you spoke to your husband a little better, but he could have made more of an effort to include you as well. I had to speak to my fianc\u00e9 about this recently as well as we were simply coexisting and not really spending time with each other. He complained I was at my moms a lot and I was frustrated he was always leaving to hang out with his guy friends or always on a game system with them but wouldn\u2019t spend more than 10 minutes a day talking with me at home. We compromised and we now spend at least one day together doing whatever we want and it seems to have brought us closer.
