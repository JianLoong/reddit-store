However, I am getting major red flags from this situation. \n\nThe interest that these parents have in your child being a part of their life (or family) without any connection to you and your spouse is eerie enough, but their manipulation of the babysitter is an even bigger red flag. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nI\u2019ve seen too many horror movies or true crime, but removing your child from any situation that they will be present in is 100% the right thing to do.

Not only are you NTA, but you\u2019d be within reason not only to fire your babysitter, but threaten a restraining order to the other parents who used manipulation to get your child over to their house if they ever try to have communication with your child outside of school or official channels, as this is not normal.", "So we had a conversation with her, she was under the impression that we had been kept in the loop by the other family.

I don\u2019t actually think they like my son, that\u2019s why I\u2019m even more weirded out and baffled as to what their motives were.

One of the kid\u2019s friends showing up at the park we\u2019re at for a play date? That\u2019s an understandable \u201coh someone must have dropped the ball communicating\u201d moment. A parent insisting I bring the child over to their home? That warrants a call home to the parents. She doesn\u2019t even have to frame it as accusatory, just say that she needed to check with you if the child had a class/doctor\u2019s appointment/activity. \n\nAn important part of a nanny/sitter\u2019s job is assessing the child\u2019s safety, and she doesn\u2019t seem to be fully capable of making proper assessments. \n\nI myself once had to tell the mom I nannied for about the home conditions of one of the kid\u2019s friends for safety reasons; the play date mother was a wealthy alcoholic who was slurring-her-words-drunk in front of me at noon and had TWO BATHTUBS filled with water in a house with 2 toddlers! She told me that the kids liked to play pirates so she just left the bathtubs filled with water all the time. There was also vomit on the floor that she had covered with a towel for the maid to clean when she came the next day(she told me it was the child\u2019s, but she was very drunk), but it was really the baths that upset me. They were full, deep tubs with metal siding(crazy expensive tubs) and I don\u2019t think a child who slipped in could have gotten themselves out. In my head, all I could think was \u201cDOES SHE WANT THE KIDS TO DROWN?!?!\u201d", "Didn't you have to text her to bring him home at least once??  She would be gone in my opinion?", "Yeah... I'm sure she's a great person, but she's also evidently a dangerously naiive one, who didn't bother to check with you before taking your kid to someone else's home. Assumptions just don't cut it in that regard; a quick text would have cost her nothing, and not sending one might someday cost everything.", "She kept your son out forever and you believe she's not part of it? Like what? You always text this other family changes about what will happen with your son but you never tell her the changes and she just believes that? Sounds suspicious.", "She might be an amazing person, but she's a truly terrible babysitter.", "I'm sure she means well, but these are the kind of babysitters that kids get kidnapped from because \"oh it was just their dad, grandma, uncle, etc picking them up\". She doesn't know how to communicate and that's an issue.", "Are you willing to bet your child\u2019s safety on the fact that she was apologetic? I get that you are trying to see the positive side  of her or whatever but don\u2019t do it at the expense of your child. Thing is she did not have the authority to take your child to someone else\u2019s house without your explicit approval. Personally, I would not leave this woman alone with my child. You never know when the next \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 might happen.", "Still not okay.  Where she takes your son and who he is allowed to interact with is something that should be cleared with you beforehand.  I would have serious concerns about letting her continue to watch your child regardless of how nice she seems - this is all just too weird.  In fact, I would end the arrangement with her.  \n\nThink about it - these people have been pursuing a relationship with your child deliberately without your knowledge or approval.  And she either knowingly or unknowingly facilitated it.  \"Aunt\" and \"uncle?\"  Nope.\n\nNTA", "Yes, even if I bought that she was just naive, which I don\u2019t personally - if her judgment is this bad what other situations can she be tricked or pressured into?", "Have you gotten any info on why the other parents are going behind your back with the babysitter? Considering she babysits their kid too, I\u2019m not sure I could ever trust that this doesn\u2019t happen ever again.", "But why are you trusting a babysitter who is making plans for your son without you? I can\u2019t wrap my head around that.", "Hahahahahahah. NO. That is not kidnapping or *any* other charge. That\u2019s a miscommunication with the nanny. Plenty of parents have a nanny/babysitter that they allow to make decisions about play dates, and don\u2019t need to have explicit parental consent.", "I think our friends down south are overreacting here, a dismissal of the babysitter is going too far.  The level of risk is different from country to country.  In Reykjavik, Iceland, mothers leave their babies on the sidewalk in their pram while they go into stores to shop.  Canada\u2019s not THAT safe obviously, but the risks are lower than in the U.S.\n\nIf this event is parent and child, would it be so bad if you or hubs was with your son?  You don\u2019t want him to bear the burden of the other mother\u2019s crazy.  But yeah, I\u2019m pretty much 100% with you.", "the problem is, short of a restraining order, you can't tell the other family what to do. They can invite anybody they want to their house and they can talk to anybody they want in the park. The person over whom you have control is your employee. So if this is how you want to play the situation- then she is in the middle - no way around it. \n\nGive her this line to use: I'm sorry but if you want to make any invitations or plans I am instructed to tell you to reach out to Mrs. OP directly and she will let me know what she decides.\n\nAre you against the children playing together if they happen to be in the park at the same time or are you instructing her to avoid that circumstance and leave if they come or don't stop if they are there?", "Thanks for the clarification OP! I was so concerned! I get it all now. Apologies. The way it was worded kind of made me think they had enrolled him and you withdrew him after finding that out and told the daycare that this family and crossed a line. \n\nAs far as the play dates, I think the connection is the babysitter as you have noted. They took advantage of the situation. Perhaps they wanted their daughter to socialize. Texting the nanny and meeting up with her, or having the nanny over with your child was easier than making arrangements with other parents, or even going out of their way to take their daughter to the park to make new connections. They were being lazy and entitled, and since they had power over the nanny they didn\u2019t even think to check with you. \n\nIf the nanny hadn\u2019t been employed by both of you this wouldn\u2019t have happened (and if she hadn\u2019t been so trusting/naive either). Glad you are nipping it in the bud!", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think she will do it again. I really think she was under the impression that this had been ok\u2019d by us with the other family. We should have spoken up sooner as well so we are partly to blame as well.", "That\u2019s what I can\u2019t understand. Especially when the babysitter also works for the other family.

She did a good job and it worked for us because she was around and got to know the other kids' parents while my parents were working and just couldn't.", "That isn't a miscommunication, she is taking their kiddo into private homes they have no business being in. It's weird and I don't think the police would look kindly upon it", "I think you really hit the nail on the head with this response! Thank you", "I\u2019ve been a nanny for 20 years. It shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place. A nanny should never take their charge to a location that isn\u2019t in their normal routine and/or pre approved by the child\u2019s parents.", "I\u2019m not sure why people want you to fire the nanny.  When I had a nanny, I put in her job description/contract \u201corganize and supervise play dates\u201d. There were general dos and don\u2019ts but you can\u2019t think of every situation you address them as they come. It sounds like the nanny knew that you were once friends but didn\u2019t know that you weren\u2019t any more. It also sounds like once she was informed she complied with your request. I don\u2019t think it is a given that all nanny contracts must contain \u201cyou shall only take the kids to preapproved locations if you don\u2019t want them to", "No problem! \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnd forgot to add: somewhat free babysitting/support! The nanny would be able to help with both kids while at the park or at their house and be a good buffer so mom/dad could do less possibly.\n\nThese people owe you $$$.", "I\u2019ve been a nanny for 15+ years and have never had to ask parents about going to the kids friends houses for play dates.

They know I wouldn\u2019t go to someone\u2019s house willy nilly. \n\nThat said, If my bosses said \u201cplease don\u2019t take my kid to this house\u201d I would 100% abide by that."]}
