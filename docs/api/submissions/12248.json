They are looking for a house together and she moved in with us almost two years ago (she\u2019s his girlfriend) and I\u2019ve tried really, really hard to accommodate her various needs while she\u2019s been living here, like no late night visitors, restrictions on who can visit when- honestly I let it get a little over the top.

I\u2019d offered her a small amount of money for the inconvenience of having them there. I was home the entire time. She wanted me to double her part when the dogs went back, despite that not having been part of the deal and having done very little other than deal with some normal barking and maybe letting them out a couple of times. That should have been a red flag.\n\nMy partner and I made plans to go away. My male roommate and I have had pets for years that are now mostly under my care.

I had offered to pay a sitter $30 a night and the [29F] roommate said she and her partner would do it, but frankly I don\u2019t trust them at this point and I want my friend who is a vet tech to come stay and care for my animals.\n\nI have told them before that leaving the dogs out in the cold is unacceptable, or at night unattended, but they don\u2019t listen. I also have ferrets and I can already picture in my mind how south cleaning up their mess could go.\n\nI care very much about both of my roommates as much as I am upset but this is nearing my breaking point because I adore my pets. \n\nAITA for saying my friend will be staying for a full week in our room while we are on vacation, and caring for the animals, no ifs, ands or buts?\n\nEdit: thank you all.

How did the dog get wet in freezing temps? If she keeps doing that, you are going to have dead pets. I think moving soneone in who will actually protect them is a good idea.

I suspect your pets wouldn't be there when you get back.\n\nEdit You realise that you're next.

She can't tell you you're not allowed to have people over.  It's obvious that your pets would suffer from abuse and neglect while you're gone and maybe even worse.

If all parties are independent then YES you DO have to sign a lease or formal agreement in the states (like federal situations for military housing, ie) to be a tenant.", "Just to be clear, she isn't neglecting your pets. Neglect tends to be ignoring them, not feeding them or caring for needs. She is actively abusing them - putting them into unsafe situations where they are likely to get ill, escape or even die.
