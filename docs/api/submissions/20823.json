{"id": 20823, "submission_id": "14lecqb", "title": "AITA for not accepting my brother and sister's relationship?", "selftext": "My mom and dad had me very young. Their relationship ended when I was 2 and it did not end well. There were a lot of accusations, no one ever admitted to anything and so they just sort of contentiously co-parented me. About 5 years after the relationship ended, my mom and dad both met their future spouses. Stepmom (SM) and Stepdad (SD) were great for the co-parent relationship and my parents weren't so concerned with what the other parent was doing. My parents would still fight, but it wasn't nearly as bad, more passive-aggressive instead of outright yelling. Eventually, my mom had a daughter with SD and my dad had a son with SM. I watched my siblings grow up since I was a decade older, spending more time with my sister because she lived with my mom.As a result, my brother and sister (not related, but shared me as a brother) spent time together as kids. Not every weekend, but playing during my sports game or when they were invited to each other's birthday parties. When I was 15-16, my parents had a big fight that basically destroyed their relationship. I am still not sure what it was about because neither the parents/SM+SD will not talk about it, but they stopped talking to one another completely. I was gifted a car and started driving myself to and from. My brother and sister basically stopped seeing each other and my family shifted into two factions and I have kept my lives separate from one another to keep the peace. There have been a few unavoidable events like graduations, but those have been few and cordial.Last week, my sister \"Grace\" (now 19f) dropped the bombshell that she met up with my brother \"Anthony\" (20m) through mutual friends. They remembered each other and exchanged numbers. They had been communicating and even started dating. She was telling me because they were interested in continuing the relationship and wanted my blessing. I didn't lie, I was pissed. I said that this was the worst idea ever. Not only do they share a sibling (they are NOT BLOOD RELATED), but their parents HATE EACH OTHER, used to be in a sexual relationship, and have gone to great lengths to have no contact for the last 10+ years. She thinks that they are over it, but I was the one that lived through it, they are my parents, after all.I straight up told her the truth, this relationship was doomed and it needed to end before they got serious feelings. I know some will say that I am a butt, but I am not thinking of me. My parents will already be tied together forever because of me which they have accepted that was their decision. But will they be able to accept their other child choosing the child of their hated ex-spouse? I don't think so. Grace pretty much told me not to project my parent's relationship onto her (which honestly, I agree). But these are her and Anthony's parents, too. Shouldn't they be thinking of them? BTW, Anthony has not responded to my texts or calls since I found out. AITB for not accepting my brother and sister's relationship?\n\nUPDATE: Just got off the phone w/Anthony and he knows how the relationship will be perceived, especially by our dad. That is why he and Grace have been dating quietly to test the waters before agreeing to come out. Now that time has come and they are telling me first, then the parents next. Anthony was using me as a gauge for how our dad and Grace's mom will react and obviously, he wasn't pleased with the result. I pretty much told him what I told Grace, that you have an uphill battle before anything has really happened. But, I did tell him something that I didn't tell Grace. I told him that I would stand behind them because, yes it is weird as hell, but at the end of the day no laws were being broken so I was cool. I will let you know how my mom and dad take it. Now that things are decided, there is no way Grace won't tell my mom. Anthony will be slower to tell our dad. We will see how it plays out.\n\nUPDATE #2: It is WWIII at my mom's house right now as she and Grace are epically fighting about her relationship with my brother. Neither of them would get on the phone with me when I called the house, but I could hear them yelling at one another. I think it is safe to say that my SD was not pleased when I was talking to him on the phone, he kept reiterating that I would need to call back at a better time. I called Anthony and told him he might want to get on to telling dad, before my mom got her wits about her and called him with the news. I just drove to my dad's because he can be pretty short-sighted sometimes (and I knew Anthony would be cowardly and call instead of doing it in-person). I had gotten there after the call and my SM was just bustling about, kind of sighing to herself like she couldn't believe that my brother would walk into this drama without consulting her. But my dad was the most surprising. I asked how he was doing and he just said that \"it was something every young man would go through\". He didn't really say more than that and I had to go, but I am pretty sure he was implying that every man would have to go through that \"mistake girl\". But that mistake girl is my sister...so there is that.", "created_utc": 1687970368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lecqb/aita_for_not_accepting_my_brother_and_sisters/", "score": 262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you have taken on a lot of emotional responsibility that is not yours. I think you should consider therapy to work on boundaries. This is literally not your problem in any way.

For real tho I don\u2019t think there is anything you can do to stop it beside tell your piece.", "This is the most intense drama i\u2019ve ever seen", "Imo, NTA. This is a weird situation and your mother's reaction kind of justifies exactly how you felt.\n\nI don't think you reacted *great* but not in any way that was unexpected or outright hurtful, you have the advice you could think of based on the experience and information you had, based on how their(your) parents are.\n\nI don't particularly think their relationship is doomed by necessity, but I absolutely think the stress your parents will put on the relationship will cripple it, in a way that isn't fair to them. The issue is, if I understand correctly, exclusively your parents - BUT in a way where they won't not make it an issue for everyone else so long as it's in their power to do so?\n\nI don't think YTA just for attempting to be grounded and warn them of the reactions they're getting. It's a shit situation. If they want to be serious they'll need to consider finding an environment away from your parents because based on your explanation, it sounds like it will be nothing but hostile and toxic.", "So I\u2019m a little confused. The prompt implies you don\u2019t stand behind them but the update indicates that you do?", "What in the Alabama roll tide fuck did I just read\u2026", "Blood related or not, it\u2019s icky all around. Aren\u2019t they something like step cousins??!?\n\nIt\u2019s gross. \n\nYTA for supporting.", "NTA you say you're not accepting but you are backing them. otherwise this sounds like the plot for a comedy.", "NTA, you certainly don\u2019t have to accept it. And if like you said, brother and sister (step-sibling or not) that\u2019s honestly weird. Are you related to both of them by blood? If so, you truly don\u2019t have to be okay with it. \n\nPersonally the whole step-sibling relationships are weird. Idrc if they are blood related or not, it\u2019s weird.", "Info: op, which side will you sit on?", "Well, this is how I found out Jerry Springer recently died oO", "\"Support\" may have meant going to bat for them to OP's parents, which sounds like a nightmare.", "Honestly, I haven't gotten that far into thought. But there is that, what if they break up? I don't want to make choices about who I can invite to my wedding or important events. I already do that with my mom and dad and it is exhausting.", "Honestly, this was my first thought.\n\nAnd it\u2019s likely to have the same degree of tragedy.", "Wouldn't this be NAH, then? Or are the siblings AHs?", "They literally went to him and asked him.", "I'm sorry, but the absolutely should be taking op into account, you know, since he's both of their sibling and all. you don't get to just date your half brothers siblings and act like they shouldn't have some opinion on their siblings dating each other. especially with family dynamics as contentious as this one.", "He was asked for his opinion.", "it is quite literally his business when he is asked for an opinion and that he is also smack dab in the middle of the inevitable fall our from their parents.", "There\u2019s a whole world of people out there and you have to go for one who shares blood with your sibling? Messy. NTA.", "okay, first off, let's cool it on the true love crap. they are 19 and 20, and haven't been together all that long. second, op was asked for an opinion and gave it, and it was the correct opinion to give. there is no chance in hell that this relationship goes down well with either of ther parents. third, where the hell does aunt/uncle come into play? they aren't expecting a baby. op is their brother", "I honestly don't see the problem with the relationship by itself. They are not blood-related and have never been brother/sister relationship. However, I am not joking when I tell you that the bitterness of my parents know no bounds. They are so much better when they are apart. With their current spouses, you would never guess that they could harbor so much resentment. My sister has less of an idea about this because my mom was always better at keeping the beef to a minimum in front of the kids. My dad...tried, but he has always been better getting it off his chest and we can hear him from upstairs. So, Anthony knows what he is getting into.", "Should officiate to be in the middle", "it has, quite literally, been proven they cannot.", "\"Two adults can suck it up\" literally like 30% of posts on this subreddits has wedding posts about people who CANT suck it up.\n\nIf you hate somebody, you hate them and want nothing to do with them.\n\nIf I was their parents I'd be admittedly pissed and wouldn't attend any event where I'd have to deal with the other family.", "True - op would have needed to define \u2018support\u2019!", "But... you aren't your parents. It is one thing to warn them that your parents will not le up, it is another for you to take on your parents' cause.\n\nWhy are you fighting a battle for your parents? Why are you making decisions of support/no support based on your parents' reaction? Who are you protecting here? It sounds like you are protecting your parents, not your half-siblings.\n\nYour parents will either need to grow up or show their children who they are.  There is nothing wrong with either of those options.", ">Why will you be torn apart when it doesn't involve? If your parents can't act like adults, about two people in a relationship who are not related, they are the jerks. It is way past time for them to grow up. I don't think it is on your brother or sister to make decisions based on whether your parents will be offended. If your parents give you trouble about something that doesn't involve you, you need to set up boundaries, as in refuse to discuss this with them.", "Honestly if your parents don't let up they are just going to turn it into an \"us against the world\" whirl wind romance.  Seriously kids at this age eat this shit up.  The best way to ensure this relationship lasts awhile is for both parents to disapprove of it.", "if anything, they put you in a shit situation because you will be forced to choose who is \"more\" important if things go bad.", "Yep.", "Don't be such a cynic. I know, you're a realist. These two need to have a baseball team of kids and then sell the rights to Lifetime.", "Okay, first off, let's cool it on the your opinion is the only correct one. OP's original post didn't specify his gender, hence the aunt/uncle thing. Just wanted to be PC and cover both bases. And no, they aren't expecting, but who knows what the future holds for these two love birds.", "I was mostly shitposting, but yeah that has to be super weird for you and lots of people don\u2019t understand that you\u2019re marrying the family too. Honestly they\u2019re super young so it probably won\u2019t last and you\u2019ll have a cringey story to tell", "A lot of people, as adults, move away from spending time with their family for reasons like this. It's a weirder situation than most but \"in-laws who hate each other\" is a tale as old as time. If they know what they're getting into and don't have utopic expectations (i.e. they know this likely means no family events with each other's side of the family) then they'll probably be ok. \n\nMaybe call your sister and tell her what you told your brother about supporting their relationship. It'll probably mean a lot to her. Raising kids with a supportive uncle around makes the prospect of not having a relationship with grandparents a bit more palatable. \n\nThat being said, don't be surprised if things actually go over well and your parents manage to set their drama aside. It might feel like a slap in the face that they couldn't get it together for you but are doing it for their other kids. Be prepared for a wide range of emotions.", "I'm reminded of a line from an old 1940's film *\"coming round the mountain'*\n\n\"Our in laws are acting like out laws.\"", "The original commentator was stating they wouldn't be happy.  It's not the adult children's job to do anything to ensure their parents are happy.", "Listen, this was a car crash that OP KNEW was coming. OP didn't call them names or disown them or anything. Their response basically amounted to, \"there are literally billions of people out there. Y'all are crushing on each other but NOT in love yet. You do NOT want to deal with the can of worms this will unleash.\"\n\nAs an older sibling, OP gave them the best advice they could. The brother took it as the advice that it was, but the sister was clearly only looking for an enthusiastic Yes and nothing more, because she thought she knew best.\n\nYes, OP could just let them sink or swim on their own, but they presumably wanted to give these kids a chance to maintain their relationship with their parents without seeing the worst of them that they knew was there. Because that's what older siblings do.", "Their relationship, not mine.", "op was asked for an opinion and gave it. and I'd really like you to explain how op doesn't have a horse in this race. he is, quite literally, smack dab in the middle of this mess", "But only if those kids all start dating each other! Or each other's half siblings...", "no, but they also don't get to play pretend ot act surprised when they aren't happy. they wanted the truth, and they need to accept that reality. their parents are not going to play happy family or pretend to be happy for them", "Huh?", "Family tree is about to turn into a family circle. Goddamn I'd struggle to come to terms with my half siblings dating. Especially if they ended up having kids. Would that make OP a \"full\" uncle rather than a \"half\" uncle? He may end up his own siblings' BIL. He'd be torn apart further if the relationship has a bad break up.\n\nFuck it they may as well turn it into a family tradition and carry it on into the 3rd generation with the siblings kids", "He\u2019s not, though.  He was asked for a blessing, chose not to give it - that\u2019s all fine.  Nonissue there.  But going forward, these aren\u2019t his kids.  He\u2019s not in the relationship.  His parents are adults and can chose to behave or not, but OP doesn\u2019t live in their houses and isn\u2019t a dependent any more.  \n\nThe kids can choose to be in a relationship that\u2019s going to have built in toxic in-laws.  They can take the chance that their relationship will crash and burn or thrive or end up with the parents being cut off from these kids.  None of that is OP\u2019s problem.  He\u2019s got his own in-laws, the same parents he always had, his own unrelated relationship.  \n\nNot my circus, not my monkeys time.", "Cousins aren\u2019t always blood related. Consider mom and dad\u2019s side all gathering for events or consider when members of the family are adopted. Blood means nothing when it comes to the psychological component at play", "Now you get it. You gotta think about the sequels.", "You asked, \"why will you be torn apart?\". I am not saying I will be, I was referring to the fact that the relationship would be torn apart and it would cause both my brother and sister pain. In a perfect world, my parents would just accept that they are dating. But that is not how my parents are. My brother and sister are still young adults and in many ways financially dependent on their sets of parents. It is not as if my siblings can just turn off the phone if my parents are angry. My sister still lives at home. My mom and dad can do pretty petty things when they feel provoked."]}
