Their relationship ended when I was 2 and it did not end well. There were a lot of accusations, no one ever admitted to anything and so they just sort of contentiously co-parented me. About 5 years after the relationship ended, my mom and dad both met their future spouses. Stepmom (SM) and Stepdad (SD) were great for the co-parent relationship and my parents weren't so concerned with what the other parent was doing. My parents would still fight, but it wasn't nearly as bad, more passive-aggressive instead of outright yelling. Eventually, my mom had a daughter with SD and my dad had a son with SM. I watched my siblings grow up since I was a decade older, spending more time with my sister because she lived with my mom.  \nAs a result, my brother and sister (not related, but shared me as a brother) spent time together as kids. Not every weekend, but playing during my sports game or when they were invited to each other's birthday parties. When I was 15-16, my parents had a big fight that basically destroyed their relationship. I am still not sure what it was about because neither the parents/SM+SD will not talk about it, but they stopped talking to one another completely. I was gifted a car and started driving myself to and from. My brother and sister basically stopped seeing each other and my family shifted into two factions and I have kept my lives separate from one another to keep the peace. There have been a few unavoidable events like graduations, but those have been few and cordial.  \nLast week, my sister \"Grace\" (now 19f) dropped the bombshell that she met up with my brother \"Anthony\" (20m) through mutual friends. They remembered each other and exchanged numbers. They had been communicating and even started dating. She was telling me because they were interested in continuing the relationship and wanted my blessing. I didn't lie, I was pissed. I said that this was the worst idea ever. Not only do they share a sibling (they are NOT BLOOD RELATED), but their parents HATE EACH OTHER, used to be in a sexual relationship, and have gone to great lengths to have no contact for the last 10+ years. She thinks that they are over it, but I was the one that lived through it, they are my parents, after all.  \nI straight up told her the truth, this relationship was doomed and it needed to end before they got serious feelings. I know some will say that I am a butt, but I am not thinking of me. My parents will already be tied together forever because of me which they have accepted that was their decision. But will they be able to accept their other child choosing the child of their hated ex-spouse? I don't think so. Grace pretty much told me not to project my parent's relationship onto her (which honestly, I agree). But these are her and Anthony's parents, too. Shouldn't they be thinking of them? BTW, Anthony has not responded to my texts or calls since I found out.

I say NTA. You don\u2019t have to accept it and I think you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t think your parents will be happy attending a wedding where both have to be present for things like father/daughter dance, etc. \n\nHowever, now that you said what needed to be said and how you feel, if they decide to pursue the relationship, that is their choice and you have to respect that even though you don\u2019t like it. I wouldn\u2019t like it if I was in your shoes. \n\nIf they continue to pursue the relationship, then it will work it\u2019s natural course and all will work out in the end.", "NAH. She asked for your blessing. You were honest. She wasn\u2019t TA for asking or having the relationship in the first place, but you also aren\u2019t TA for being honest. You could maybe have said \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for XYZ, but I\u2019ll support you\u2019 but if she genuinely wanted your blessing and not a placatory statement she\u2019d understand your feelings. \n\nYour parents opinions also don\u2019t come into it. They should be able to put their opinions aside for their children.", "Nta, this is some gossip girl shit", "NAH y\u2019all need Jerry Springer RIP", "NTA - she asked for your blessing which implies your opinion. You gave it, she really shouldn\u2019t have expected a better reaction. It is weird you could have taken it even worse. Your also really entitled to not want to deal with your parents being together more often this will effect you. Your opinions and feelings are valid. The siblings are way out of line. Your brother is probably dodging your calls because he knows how weird it is and how badly you will take it, he obviously didn\u2019t care enough to prioritize your feelings so still shitting but at least understands your a person with feelings.", "NTA - I don't get people saying it's none of your business when they literally asked your opinion. They asked, you gave it. I don't know why anyone would expect you to have a positive reaction.\n\nLike, imagine telling people that you're dating your half-siblings other half-sibling. It's one of those things that's not technically wrong, but it's still weird as hell.\n\nYou don't have to accept this relationship, but I would also leave them alone about it if I were you. It sounds like they're going to have a difficult enough time explaining this to their parents, so it's probably best for you to drop it and let them deal with it on their own. No one can say how serious their relationship is or if it will even last, so I would just let the relationship run it's course. And if the relationship is serious and they get married, there is no rule that says you have to go to their wedding.", "NTA\n\nI feel that you carry hurt in your heart that you had to let go of having both parents together other than few occasions as they cannot be cordial to each other for more than probably a few hours. Your reaction also implies that you will be hurt if they end up being cordial to each other if their kids get more serious about each other. Very understandable for you to get hurt because they didn\u2019t do it for you. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are the AH here. Unfortunately you don\u2019t have any control over the situation. You should try to distance yourself from the situation, take serious therapy to help get over it and then make your own family.", "Since they asked for your blessing, NTA. They had to know this would be really weird for you and put you in an awkward position. They don't get to be upset because you answered a question they asked honestly. \n\nAnd while I agree no one should be projecting your parents relationship onto this new one, it is a legitimate concern. Starting a relationship with someone knowing neither of your parents will approve is hard enough without additional complications of family members in common!\n\nThat said, now that you've said you don't approve, leave it alone. Either they'll take your advice and break up or they won't. Just try to stay out of the way of any messy fallout (and if your parents don't know, don't be the one to tell them!).\n\nEdit: typo fix", "get on with your own life.  lots of things are happening all the time that we may not like or agree with, but a habit of acceptance will help you live your life.", "NTA, you don\u2019t have to approve of anything nor does anyone need your approval", "I don't know if you are or not. One thing for sure is that if the relationship continues to grow, the shit storm from the parents might be epic and fun to watch.", "This is a thing that can happen with brother/sister dynamics. Look into it, and send the articles to your sister. Romantic feelings towards siblings happens, and when it does, the forged \u201cconnection\u201d is thought to be romantic love, but it ain\u2019t.

There are few events but they as well can be cordial like your graduation. Not saying it would go well, but I also won' t think it is straight out with no hope. \n\nWorst case scenario they break up and you keep them separate as you did until now", "Yta - no. They shouldn't be thinking about their grown parents refusing to be adults. They shouldn't even be thinking about you. This is their choice and they can deal with the fallout if they want.", "Soft YTA. I understand why this is weird for you, but you're projecting. Your childhood was shaped by your parents fighting, but Grace and Anthony had completely different experiences growing up. They're not beholden to the relationship (or lack thereof) between your parents, and the conflict between your parents is not central to their lives the way it is to yours. I'm truly sorry for what you've been through but they're not doing anything wrong, and in freaking out about how their/your parents will react, you're allowing your parents' bad relationship to continue to control your life in a way it doesn't need to anymore. Your parents clearly didn't let you, Grace, or Anthony get in the way of doing things the way they wanted to/having relationships they wanted to; why should Grace and Anthony 'think of your parents' when it doesn't seem like your parents were that considerate of you guys, the kids?", "YTA. Your opinion on this really doesn't matter, and neither does your parents. That's for your siblings to deal with.", "nta, its wierd....they each have you as a sister. \n\nReally wirrd and will only end in tons of drama and backlash.", "NTA. It\u2019s weird as shit. I grew up spending time with  my half sister\u2019s half brothers and sister when we were kids. That would be so weird. And while there\u2019s no blood connection, there is a term for this. It\u2019s called quarter siblings. You\u2019re not the asshole because they asked for your blessing and you have no obligation to give it. They invited your feedback on the situation. There are literally billions of other people in the world they can date who they don\u2019t share a sibling with", "YTA, very gently. I get what your parents put you through was awful. And it's weird having your half sibling dating. But they haven't done anything wrong here, and if your parent have a problem with it that's THEIR problem to work out with your siblings, not yours. It sounds like you have taken on a lot of emotional responsibility that is not yours. I think you should consider therapy to work on boundaries. This is literally not your problem in any way. You are not the parents of these people and you are not the person in the relationship that may upset your parents. You are 100% free to wish them well and be completely uninvolved with their relationship with your/their respective parents. This is not a problem for you.", "YTA\n\nYou don't like it.  Fine. \n\nBut you don't get a say.  I've been married for decades.  It's extraordinarily rare my parents and my inlaws need to interact. Who cares if they don't get along.  \n\nLet them be.  Keep your mouth shut.", "Nah and you won't be as long as you don't continue to harp on it.   You can not be happy. You can not condone it. But at the end of the day, theyre not doing something wrong.  All the parents here dont get to control their choices. \n\nThey aren't related by blood, they didn't grow up as siblings in the same house (sounds like they had as much interaction as if they were neighbor kids).", "[deleted]", "Yep.  YTA.  Just leave it.", "YTA. Who are you to stand between true love? Your only concern is being the best aunt/uncle possible.", "YTA. Not your business so stay out of it.", "YTA. Not for thinking it\u2019s unusual, or perhaps bound to be fraught with future difficulties (as many relationships can be) but for this\n\n>   I was pissed. I said this was the worst idea ever.\n\nPretty sure they are well aware that their parents are exes who can\u2019t stand each other. \n\nToo bad, and your parents sound awful\u2026 but, who cares?   In a lot of situations the two sets of in-laws barely have to see each other\u2026 Maybe at a wedding, or both going to see the grandkids but they don\u2019t have to see each other all the time\u2026 And if they\u2019re incapable of remaining civil in the presence of their children then they\u2019re complete assholes.  No offense but seriously putting you in the middle of all that all this time especially when they should be long over everything no matter what had happened years later.  I mean you\u2019re saying you were 15 or 16, years after their initial divorce, where they had some blow up and the the kids couldn\u2019t be around each other? They need to get over themselves.  \n\nWhy would you take your parents asshole considerations into anything involving your siblings? Stop letting them run your life\u2026 They did it with you don\u2019t let them do it with your siblings.", "YTA. It was fine to tell grace your concerns, but that's it. I think you should apologize for overreacting and start being supportive.", "I think its weird as hell, but still yta. I also think if someone outright asked you that put you in a pretty awkward position though.\n\n FWIW I've met one set of parents-in-law once, and the other never.", "Yta\n\nThey aren't related and who cares if their parents don't like each other, they are adults.", "YTA , they are both adults and not blood related. \n\nAlso your parents and stepparents made their choices and have their reasons to hating eachother, and you can't do anything about it.\n\nLive your own life and think of your own happiness.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And here genetics don' t even factor.\n\nI do get why it is weird for OP, since for him both are his siblings, but that is only his side that does not affect them . Also get why the parents will be annoyed , nobody wants their kid to marry ex's kid if they're on bad terms }regardless of OPs existence I think)...but if they are okay with annoying their parents and possible consequences it' s their adult decision.\n\nI think devaluating their feelings would get OP absolutely nowhere", "You could call it a cousin dynamic too.

It's not any different than dating any one else you grew up in proximity to regularly - a schoolmate, a kid from sunday school, the child of a parents' best friends, or literally anyone else in your community who was in your cohort.
