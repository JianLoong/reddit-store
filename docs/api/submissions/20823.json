{"id": 20823, "submission_id": "14lecqb", "title": "AITA for not accepting my brother and sister's relationship?", "selftext": "My mom and dad had me very young. Their relationship ended when I was 2 and it did not end well. There were a lot of accusations, no one ever admitted to anything and so they just sort of contentiously co-parented me. About 5 years after the relationship ended, my mom and dad both met their future spouses. Stepmom (SM) and Stepdad (SD) were great for the co-parent relationship and my parents weren't so concerned with what the other parent was doing. My parents would still fight, but it wasn't nearly as bad, more passive-aggressive instead of outright yelling. Eventually, my mom had a daughter with SD and my dad had a son with SM. I watched my siblings grow up since I was a decade older, spending more time with my sister because she lived with my mom.As a result, my brother and sister (not related, but shared me as a brother) spent time together as kids. Not every weekend, but playing during my sports game or when they were invited to each other's birthday parties. When I was 15-16, my parents had a big fight that basically destroyed their relationship. I am still not sure what it was about because neither the parents/SM+SD will not talk about it, but they stopped talking to one another completely. I was gifted a car and started driving myself to and from. My brother and sister basically stopped seeing each other and my family shifted into two factions and I have kept my lives separate from one another to keep the peace. There have been a few unavoidable events like graduations, but those have been few and cordial.Last week, my sister \"Grace\" (now 19f) dropped the bombshell that she met up with my brother \"Anthony\" (20m) through mutual friends. They remembered each other and exchanged numbers. They had been communicating and even started dating. She was telling me because they were interested in continuing the relationship and wanted my blessing. I didn't lie, I was pissed. I said that this was the worst idea ever. Not only do they share a sibling (they are NOT BLOOD RELATED), but their parents HATE EACH OTHER, used to be in a sexual relationship, and have gone to great lengths to have no contact for the last 10+ years. She thinks that they are over it, but I was the one that lived through it, they are my parents, after all.I straight up told her the truth, this relationship was doomed and it needed to end before they got serious feelings. I know some will say that I am a butt, but I am not thinking of me. My parents will already be tied together forever because of me which they have accepted that was their decision. But will they be able to accept their other child choosing the child of their hated ex-spouse? I don't think so. Grace pretty much told me not to project my parent's relationship onto her (which honestly, I agree). But these are her and Anthony's parents, too. Shouldn't they be thinking of them? BTW, Anthony has not responded to my texts or calls since I found out. AITB for not accepting my brother and sister's relationship?\n\nUPDATE: Just got off the phone w/Anthony and he knows how the relationship will be perceived, especially by our dad. That is why he and Grace have been dating quietly to test the waters before agreeing to come out. Now that time has come and they are telling me first, then the parents next. Anthony was using me as a gauge for how our dad and Grace's mom will react and obviously, he wasn't pleased with the result. I pretty much told him what I told Grace, that you have an uphill battle before anything has really happened. But, I did tell him something that I didn't tell Grace. I told him that I would stand behind them because, yes it is weird as hell, but at the end of the day no laws were being broken so I was cool. I will let you know how my mom and dad take it. Now that things are decided, there is no way Grace won't tell my mom. Anthony will be slower to tell our dad. We will see how it plays out.\n\nUPDATE #2: It is WWIII at my mom's house right now as she and Grace are epically fighting about her relationship with my brother. Neither of them would get on the phone with me when I called the house, but I could hear them yelling at one another. I think it is safe to say that my SD was not pleased when I was talking to him on the phone, he kept reiterating that I would need to call back at a better time. I called Anthony and told him he might want to get on to telling dad, before my mom got her wits about her and called him with the news. I just drove to my dad's because he can be pretty short-sighted sometimes (and I knew Anthony would be cowardly and call instead of doing it in-person). I had gotten there after the call and my SM was just bustling about, kind of sighing to herself like she couldn't believe that my brother would walk into this drama without consulting her. But my dad was the most surprising. I asked how he was doing and he just said that \"it was something every young man would go through\". He didn't really say more than that and I had to go, but I am pretty sure he was implying that every man would have to go through that \"mistake girl\". But that mistake girl is my sister...so there is that.", "created_utc": 1687970368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lecqb/aita_for_not_accepting_my_brother_and_sisters/", "score": 2618, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you have taken on a lot of emotional responsibility that is not yours. I think you should consider therapy to work on boundaries. This is literally not your problem in any way.

Accept them and since you're experienced, be the guide that they need. Maybe something good will come out of the trainwreck your parents caused.", "NTA but have to admit I'm just here to admit that it took me waaaay to long to work out how these two aren't related because I was sure they were half-siblings, but it does actually make sense - they are dated their parent's EX partners next child (but the ex isn't their parent)\n\nI'm honestly surprised they don't give each other the ick just thinking about it", "NTA- You have an opportunity here to be a mediator or officiant. Op put in a very awkward situation by his family. If it were me in op's shoes I would go LC on this situation.", "NAH Your siblings were too young to know how bad the fallout was and are probably too naive and in love to even care. You have every right to be weirded out because this is unnatural to you. Parents are also allowed to be weirded out, uncomfortable, and mad by it but your dad's comment is worrisome.", "NTA. You were just warning them of what they were going to expect, and you were absolutely correct. What I think is cool about the whole situation is that when and if they themselves have children, you will be a Double Aunt/Uncle to them (I didn't catch which you would be when reading).\n\nNot every day is someone related to 2 people, they get together, and it's not creepy or illegal. Lol\n\nBut you would be some kind of rare Full blooded aunt to their offspring, and I wonder if there is a different term to that than just \"Aunt or Uncle.\"", "Not the asshole. You gave them your honest opinion on the relationship as their older brother in a mature way. The only assholes are your parents for holding a grudge against each other to the point where they're affecting you and your brother and sister. \n\nI'd suggest speaking with your sister again and telling her the same thing you told your brother. I would also suggest making it clear to both your siblings that while you're fine with them together, you're not going to choose sides if things don't turn out right.", "NTA on the basis that you knew if would cause a war.\n\nLove the updates, you might want to go and help your sister if you haven't already done so.\n\nFamily holidays will never be the same again.\n\n!Updateme", "NTA - But you need to stay out of it. You\u2019re playing the middle man and that won\u2019t be fair to you. You\u2019re catering to their feelings and helping them when they didn\u2019t even take it to heart how this could negatively impact you\u2026 They went for the \u201cforbidden fruit\u201d so now they can pay the price.", "I'm going to say NTA for you, although I think your reaction was a bit much. It may be a bit weird for you having your brother and sister dating but to them they're just an unrelated guy and a girl who like each other.  You expressed your feelings and concerns but you also said you would stand behind them, which is why your getting the NTA.  The real AHs here are your parents.  They're projecting their issues with each other onto their children.  Their romantic relationship ended what - 20 years ago?  They both need to grow up, get over themselves and stop letting their gripes with each other impact you and their other children.", "NAH but damn sweet home alabama theme song lmao", "I'm reading this thinking my family is the boring kind of of shitty. At least there's a shakespearian kinda weird to discuss here.\n\nNTA nobody will have a good answer to this it's out of most people's world of empathy or understanding. A unique AITA where no answer is right or wrong. Do whatever makes you happy or get over preconceived notions to pickup a couple family allies who are happy with their lives and each other. Idn goodluck.", "Two households, both alike in dignity\u2026", "NTA. I hope this doesn\u2019t make your life harder.", "You grew up as the mediator. You don't have to keep doing it. You can sit on the sidelines and let it work itself out.", "NTA. I find your dad\u2019s reaction to be interesting. Like, if we assume children take after the same sex parent the most, then your brother would take most after your dad and your sister takes most after yout mom. So if your parents were once into eachother, then, following this logic, it makes sense your siblings would be into eachother. And so your dad thinking this is a mistake your brother has to make, It fits given your dad went through the same mistake. Id be interested to see how this relationship turns out. I mean, if it ends in a messy breakup, well, you ll be caught in the middle again. And if they have a kid before splitting, you can bond with that kid really well.", "YTA.", "NAH but we can get more updates \ud83d\ude02", "This is a repost from months ago.\n\nWord for word.\n\nStop it.", "Lmaooo NTA but this has happened to me. My half sister dated AND MARRIED my half brother. They\u2019re divorced now but were together for like 10 years. Very uncomfortable at first. & now uncomfortable again..\ud83d\udc80", "....I was not prepared for what I just read. I dont know what I expected, but this isnt it.\n\nI'm torn between NTA, NAH and ESH (NOT OP in that last one).  The only true people here that I consider TA are the parents.\n\nI'm just trying to picture the family tree Game of Thrones style and....god that's a weird one.", "NAH. It makes sense why you wouldn\u2019t approve of it. It is weird. But they\u2019re young and in love and honestly, they probably think they\u2019re Romeo and Juliet rn. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything anyone\u2019s gonna say that will change their mind. The more you push back the more they\u2019re gonna hold fast to each other. Best you can do is support them and protect them from their parents.", "The best thing here would be if your parents would become the adults that they are supposed to be, and get some counseling to attempt to get past their hatred. \nAs for your siblings relationship, it will be whatever it\u2019s supposed to be. Your parents shouldn\u2019t poison the well with their hate.", "Take care of yourself, because ops siblings are already taking care of each other. Aye ohhhh!!!", "It might be legal and whatnot, but who walks into this kind of shit?", "I'd learn to play a banjo for family gatherings.", "True, though this is more weeds in the basement than flowers in the attic: unwanted but not too surprising", "Omg the fact they would be in-laws too....woah. I just hope you are alright OP, be well dude.", "Not to be nosy, (but honestly to be quite nosy) please keep us updated. Your sister really didn't see this world war coming? \n\nYou are NTA and first hand experience of how bad it can be", "Honestly, don\u2019t worry about it. My parents had a very contentious divorce(years long in court, actually were kicked out from one court house and forced to go  to another city, my dad got custody\u2019s of three kids under 10). \nDad wouldn\u2019t even pull into the driveway when he picked us up or dropped us off at moms house. Until we were old enough to do it ourselves we had a \u201chired representative\u201d that would make phone calls for us to the other parent so they didn\u2019t risk the chance of speaking to each other. The custody arrangement was ironclad and a third party would do pick up\u2019s/drop offs.\n\nThere have been graduations, weddings, births between all the kids and they just ignore each other. We (the three kids) have stopped caring and just let them feel awkward. It\u2019s their problem, not ours.", "All my grandparents were the same.  Though they always managed to hide it from the grandkids.  It wasn\u2019t till I was much older that I found out that they all hated each other.", "Yeah, kind of on the same level as dating a step-sibling. No blood relation, but still seems too closely related to be right.", "Fucked up if true.", "They were absolutely fake though. A lot of the people were  actually professional wrestlers cause they know how to play a character and can make fake fights look good.", "Isnt op the brother??", "Thank you. I tease her by telling her I\u2019m more related to her than her parents.", "Let\u2019s also not forget that they are 19 and 20.  There is plenty of time to meet someone else - it\u2019s not like they are mid/late 30s and have been fighting feelings for each other for years.  Sensible thing is break it off and find another fish in the very vast ocean that is young adult dating.", "As it turns out, yes.  Apparently I massively missed that lol", "My wife and I were 18 & 19 when we got together,  now 32 & 33. When you meet the right person it just works itself out.", "We were 19/20 and here we are, 28 years later! It can be done!! Congratulations to you guys!", "I started sketching it out in my brain and it is ... Weird that OP is smack in the middle for that couple. \ud83e\udd23", "the family tree is a wreath", "Op is gonna share more DNA with there nibbling then there own siblings \ud83e\udd23", "it would be more like a double nephew, cause of both parents being related to op, but if you take into account how they are only op's half siblings then it cancels out and is just a nephew, not  a double or quarter nephew.\n\nI put way too much thought into this lol", "The nibbling would share more DNA then ops half siblings lol", "I\u2019m sorry but the first sentence of the paragraph that said \u201cit is WWIII\u201d following the whole spiel was so fucking funny", "It\u2019s not illegal but it feels so fucking weird \ud83e\udd22 that\u2019s like if my brother from my mom\u2019s side dated my sister from my dad\u2019s side and it\u2019s just so gross. It\u2019s like dating your cousin!!", "i think YTA. Sorry. I think you need to stop humoring your parents bullshit, stop playing along with them, stop calling them to do damage control. I think you need to tell them to STFU, grow up, stop bickering and get over it. And butt out, and support your siblings. And get on with your life, let the chips fall where they may, and stop letting your parents bullshit affect you. Truly wish you the best.", "I think you just should MYOB about the relationship. Don't get involved in the drama.", "NTA, but also, your parents feelings and reactions are no longer your responsibility. I feel for you. It will probably hurt too if your parents make amends for the sake of these kids, but couldn\u2019t grow up for your sake. This is not your business. Let your siblings and your parents deal with it. Whatever happens, happens.", "Lol a modern day Romeo and Juliet. \n\nGonna go with NAH. You\u2019ve said your piece and it makes sense and if they get serious it\u2019ll be disruptive. It sounds like you might be a little too late tho.", "NTA.\n\nYour siblings are young, this may be a lasting relationship, it may not.  They are old enough to figure that out for themselves.  Your parents and step parents may just have to accept it IF they want to keep contact with the two while the relationship goes on.", "NTA \n\nFamily drama aside, I can see why you are uncomfortable with their relationship because seriously, what the hell.\n\nYou grew up with both of them, You saw both of them as your siblings. They may not be blood related to each other but they are both blood related to You and the fact that they met each other through you is even weirder.", "XoXo Gossip Girl \ud83d\udc80 you are NTA but the drama and fallout from this is going to be a nuclear blast", "NTA because damn that **is** weird O\\_O O\\_O\n\nIs it... it's not even incest but.... they grew up as siblings for a bit?!?\n\nAnyway, your parents, tho? They seem toxic as hell", "NTA, I totally agree with OP. No laws were broken and they are in zero way blood related, but the fact that one of each of their parents (both OP's parents) were married and had a nasty divorce, will forever make the relationship fail, if they stay in contact with their parents. If the divorce was as bad as OP stated, they will not get over it, even though they are adults. And odds are the relationship between a 19&20 year old will not last. This just creates a massive headache for OP. I do commend OP for standing behind both of his half siblings, but OP has every right not to condone the relationship", "NAH.\n\nThe only difference between this and every other Romeo & Julie feuding families story is poor OP being stuck in the middle.\n\nOP is perfectly entitled to disapprove of their relationship, just as they are entitled to defend it.", "Agreed that this is just a....situation. I have a family member in a \"technically/legally\" not related relationship and it is fucking awkward and some people on both sides have made their disapproval known.", "Well, they aint related so not quite Alabama, but it is close, so maybe Mississippi roll tide? :D", "u/Legitimate-Mine-3428 time to officiate the wedding and stand dead center, between and supporting behind your sibs", "They should get a chair right smack in the middle of the aisle", "I think YTA. You are definitely the victim of all this so I totally get it, but there's nothing wrong with them dating, and you should try and be supportive. You might end up being the only family member who supports them. It's the right thing to do.\n\nYou're family is F'ed up and you've been abused in some ways, but your brother and sister are not the problem.\n\nSoft YTA.", "How in the whole wide world could they both harbour such resentment to the extent that the dad shouts and you hear it from frigging downstairs? Seriously messed up. OP, if you could just tell me how you lived through all that, I would thank you a lot.", "Romeo and Juliet came to my mind too. Also The Forsythe Saga and the relationship between Jon and Fleur. NTA OP but learn from all those literary references. Trying to keep the apart is the fastest way to push them together.", "because it can only take one forgotten condom or one failure of a contraceptive for a child to get made.", "Because there is banjo music playing in the background while they read this post. \n\nJoke aside I agree that everyone is putting the cart before the horse on that topic, the odds of most 19/ year olds relationships ending in marriage is significantly lower than it resulting in them getting married.", "You know it happens. My friend's siblings didn't date, but his brother married his wife's sister. So their children are biological cousins twice.", "They've been together for 3 weeks and already feel the need to tell their families about the relationship? Why are they jumping the gun here? They're literally inviting drama for no good reason.", "Not really. OP says that they would meet up at things like his sports games and occasional birthday parties. That's not a sibling bond, that's more like the child of a family friend, or at most a cousin.\n\nThe Westermarck effect is more about kids who are raised together, which isn't the case here.\n\nYes, knowing each other as kids probably did contribute to their relationship but I don't think that childhood relationship comes anywhere close to sibling level.", "My husband and started dating in college when I was 18 and he was 17. If someone had mentioned kids I would have freaked out. We now have 2 teenagers and have been together more than 27 year, 21 of those married.", ">The Westermarck effect is more about kids who are raised together\n\nThat's my point; since they were raised separately they *don't* have that, in spite of being treated as semi-siblings.", "So does the \"I drop the one I love for the approval of my family\"", "I think it would math to roughly the same"]}
