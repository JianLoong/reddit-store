I\u2019m using my 2nd account because my real account has my wife.\n\nThis below part is just a background why my sister lives with us atm. \n\nMy sister is back with us at the moment and been living with us since october because of on going divorce with her husband. My wife was not fan of this and wanted my sister out and told me to give her our other accommodation which we own to my sister whilst she settles for divorce but my sister wants to live with us as she gets lonely and won\u2019t have anyone cook for her because this whole thing is stressing her out. My wife has left our business cus of broken leg so she can help with the cooking for my sister.\n\nSince the start of the year my wife been wanting Dyson Air thing for Hair(I don\u2019t get the excitement) and yes I bought her the gift in November for xmas and I wrapped it and put it in our garage. Few days ago my sister was wrapping gifts for xmas and asked me what I got for my wife I told her its a Dyson Hair product and a Gucci perfume(around \u00a3700 in total) my sister got excited for my wife but sad again and said she wanted Dyson Hair product too and used to beg her husband to buy it for but he never did. Apparently he gifted the Dyson to his now GF. This obviously made me sad so I wanted to buy her another Dyson hair product same as my wife. I also had wrapped shoes for my sister for xmas. I went to different stores but it was sold out (my luck) I looked online and it would only be delivered after xmas. Because there was no option for my sister I just removed the name sticker and put my sisters name gifted the Dyson I bought for my wife to my sister. Keep this in mind I bought my wife extra gucci perfume she STILL got the gift. \n\nAnd yesterday I gave everyone their gift and everyone was happy!! Until my mum told me that she saw my wife\u2019s face during the gift giving and my wife looked hurt apparently and asked me why I didn\u2019t gift my wife the Dyson instead? (I thought she was happy with the gift perfume I gave) I told my mum the truth and my mother is calling me an A-hole. My parents wanted to buy my wife Dyson hair for xmas but asked me before they bought it so I told them I was going to buy it for my wife. So they thought I\u2019d actually give it to my wife and not change the plan last min.\n\nNow my mum told our aunty too snd she thinks I was a-hole too. I told them I will buy my wife again cus we will have plenty of time but they think it won\u2019t be the same as \u201cxmas magic\u201d so aita?\n\nEDIT: My sister do not live with our parents because they live up north in Scottish village. Us we live in England our of our business is in England and my sister works here and her work is 20 min drive away from where we live. \n\nMY wife can walk she don\u2019t need crutches. The reason she left our business was because of broken leg. But she\u2019s walkable but she decided to rest after her cast was off.", "created_utc": 1672056754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvly51/aita_for_giving_my_wifes_christmas_present_to_my/", "score": 10796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First your wife doesn't want your sister there and you take her anyway, mkay this is the only part i can get with you because i love my sister more than anything, however respecting consent and boundaries and finding a compromise should have been made. Like your sister staying half a week with you and not all the time. Then, you ask your wife to cook for your sister while she got a broken leg ? Excuse me but what the fuck. You ask your INJURED wife, who is supposed to get rest TO COOK FOR YOUR SISTER while she didn't even WANT HER TO STAY WITH YOU. i put in highlight what makes you the asshole if you wonder. And then, ok your wife got an expensive perfume, but she did NOT ask for the perfume, she wanted the hair dryer, she asked you for that, and you thought the perfume would make up for it because it's expensive. Who care that it is expensive, that's not what she wanted. Instead she watched your sister open the gift that was supposed to be for her, and saw how ONCE AGAIN you put total priority on your sister while giving no fuck about hurting your wife. You disrespected your wife opinion and authority by not listening to her, you disrespected your wife by making her cook for your sister (YOU should be the one cooking, and if you work prep the meals the night before or morning before leaving), and then you shat all over her feeling and disrespected her once again when you offered the only gift she asked to your sister. Your mom and aunts are both rights. Now when you will get the dyson to your wife, all she will think is that she got it later because she never was a priority for you.

Few days ago my sister was wrapping gifts for xmas and asked me what I got for my wife I told her its a Dyson Hair product and a Gucci perfume(around \u00a3700 in total) my sister got excited for my sister but sad again and said she wanted Dyson Hair product too and used to beg her husband to buy it for but he never did. Apparently he gifted the Dyson to his now GF. This obviously made me sad so I wanted to buy her another Dyson hair product same as my wife. I also had wrapped shoes for my sister for xmas. I went to different stores but it was sold out (my luck) I looked online and it would only be delivered after xmas. Because there was no option for my sister I just removed the name sticker and put my sisters name gifted the Dyson I bought for my wife to my sister. Keep this in mind I bought my wife extra gucci perfume she STILL got the gift. \n\nAnd yesterday I gave everyone their gift and everyone was happy!! Until my mum told me that she saw my wife\u2019s face during the gift giving and my wife looked hurt apparently and asked me why I didn\u2019t gift my wife the Dyson instead? (I thought she was happy with the gift perfume I gave) I told my mum the truth and my mother is calling me an A-hole. My parents wanted to buy my wife Dyson hair for xmas but asked me before they bought it so I told them I was going to buy it for my wife. So they thought I\u2019d actually give it to my wife and not change the plan last min.\n\nNow my mum told our aunty too snd she thinks I was a-hole too. I told them I will buy my wife again cus we will have plenty of time but they think it won\u2019t be the same as \u201cxmas magic\u201d so aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re both AH.  \n\nOP, if you care even a little about your marriage, your wife\u2019s safety and comfort in the house she lives in should be your priority.

She asked OP what he'd gotten his wife, he told her it was the Dyson, and she lamented that her ex-husband didn't get her one, so it doesn't take a genius to connect the dots when sister received the Dyson and wife didn't.
