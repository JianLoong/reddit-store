I\u2019m using my 2nd account because my real account has my wife.\n\nThis below part is just a background why my sister lives with us atm. \n\nMy sister is back with us at the moment and been living with us since october because of on going divorce with her husband. My wife was not fan of this and wanted my sister out and told me to give her our other accommodation which we own to my sister whilst she settles for divorce but my sister wants to live with us as she gets lonely and won\u2019t have anyone cook for her because this whole thing is stressing her out. My wife has left our business cus of broken leg so she can help with the cooking for my sister.\n\nSince the start of the year my wife been wanting Dyson Air thing for Hair(I don\u2019t get the excitement) and yes I bought her the gift in November for xmas and I wrapped it and put it in our garage. Few days ago my sister was wrapping gifts for xmas and asked me what I got for my wife I told her its a Dyson Hair product and a Gucci perfume(around \u00a3700 in total) my sister got excited for my wife but sad again and said she wanted Dyson Hair product too and used to beg her husband to buy it for but he never did. Apparently he gifted the Dyson to his now GF. This obviously made me sad so I wanted to buy her another Dyson hair product same as my wife. I also had wrapped shoes for my sister for xmas. I went to different stores but it was sold out (my luck) I looked online and it would only be delivered after xmas. Because there was no option for my sister I just removed the name sticker and put my sisters name gifted the Dyson I bought for my wife to my sister. Keep this in mind I bought my wife extra gucci perfume she STILL got the gift. \n\nAnd yesterday I gave everyone their gift and everyone was happy!! Until my mum told me that she saw my wife\u2019s face during the gift giving and my wife looked hurt apparently and asked me why I didn\u2019t gift my wife the Dyson instead? (I thought she was happy with the gift perfume I gave) I told my mum the truth and my mother is calling me an A-hole. My parents wanted to buy my wife Dyson hair for xmas but asked me before they bought it so I told them I was going to buy it for my wife. So they thought I\u2019d actually give it to my wife and not change the plan last min.\n\nNow my mum told our aunty too snd she thinks I was a-hole too. I told them I will buy my wife again cus we will have plenty of time but they think it won\u2019t be the same as \u201cxmas magic\u201d so aita?\n\nEDIT: My sister do not live with our parents because they live up north in Scottish village. Us we live in England our of our business is in England and my sister works here and her work is 20 min drive away from where we live. \n\nMY wife can walk she don\u2019t need crutches. The reason she left our business was because of broken leg. But she\u2019s walkable but she decided to rest after her cast was off.", "created_utc": 1672056754, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvly51/aita_for_giving_my_wifes_christmas_present_to_my/", "score": 437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s a grown woman, she can cook for herself!!

On top of that, you expected your injured wife to cook for her? Tell me this is a prank and you\u2019re not really that thick headed. \n\nI understand your sister is going through a lot, but she\u2019s an adult and can take care of herself. If she can\u2019t cook for herself, she can order out. Just like every adult has to do every day. If she wanted the Dyson hair thingamabob, she can save up for it herself (especially since she doesn\u2019t have to pay rent, which, again, every adult has to do). Just as you say your wife has plenty of time for the thingamabob, no matter what, your sister has even more time to wait for it. \n\nIf you keep pushing aside your wife for your sister, you\u2019ll soon be asking your sister for divorce attorney recommendations for yourself.", "YTA\n\nMajor asshole.

Your wife would hope for some TLC but you only seem to care about your sister's hurt feelings.\n\nYou and your parents knew how much your wife wanted that hairdryer and you bought it for her.\n\nThen you prioritised your sister's happiness over your wife's.

I really hope your wife finds this account and sees millions of people are on her side and telling her to prioritize herself since her stupid husband won\u2019t.\n\nEdit: also to put price values on the items. I have the dyson hair wrap - it\u2019s $600. A Gucci perfume (which OP is saying omg it\u2019s such a great gift is at most $200 - and that is if he bought the big bottle).", "YTA. The Christmas present isn't the real problem. Imposing your sister on your wife is. Your sister is 39- she doesn't need another adult cooking for her like she's a child.

It must suck asking your SO something, and see them gifting it to someone else.\n\nWhy couldn't you just jave bought one for your sister once they came available again?", "YTA not only is your sister a 39 year old woman that expects people to cook for her she deliberately manipulated you into giving her your wife's Christmas present with her sob stories, no wonder your wife is fuming, you messed up big time sort your self out mate", "YTA, and that\u2019s even before I get to your expectation that your wife should cook for your sister even though wife has a broken leg.", "YTA\n\n1. Your wife gave a compromise to help you and your sister but you completely stomped on it\n2.

How many more ways can you come up with to show your wife how little she means to you?", "YTA \n\nYour wife has a broken leg but apparently she can cook for your sister? \n\nHow about your adult sister who is a guest in your home learns to cook and takes care of your wife while she\u2019s recovering, to say thanks for having her there? \n\nYou gave your wife\u2019s gift away to your miserable, immature, nearly 40yo sister. \n\nHow can you not see you\u2019re the AH here?

First your wife doesn't want your sister there and you take her anyway, mkay this is the only part i can get with you because i love my sister more than anything, however respecting consent and boundaries and finding a compromise should have been made. Like your sister staying half a week with you and not all the time. Then, you ask your wife to cook for your sister while she got a broken leg ? Excuse me but what the fuck. You ask your INJURED wife, who is supposed to get rest TO COOK FOR YOUR SISTER while she didn't even WANT HER TO STAY WITH YOU. i put in highlight what makes you the asshole if you wonder. And then, ok your wife got an expensive perfume, but she did NOT ask for the perfume, she wanted the hair dryer, she asked you for that, and you thought the perfume would make up for it because it's expensive. Who care that it is expensive, that's not what she wanted. Instead she watched your sister open the gift that was supposed to be for her, and saw how ONCE AGAIN you put total priority on your sister while giving no fuck about hurting your wife. You disrespected your wife opinion and authority by not listening to her, you disrespected your wife by making her cook for your sister (YOU should be the one cooking, and if you work prep the meals the night before or morning before leaving), and then you shat all over her feeling and disrespected her once again when you offered the only gift she asked to your sister. Your mom and aunts are both rights. Now when you will get the dyson to your wife, all she will think is that she got it later because she never was a priority for you. Congrat you ruined the gift in itself. You should be happy that your christmas gift were not divorce paper.\n\nEdit:typo", "So you know how your sister is getting divorced right now? Looks like you\u2019ll be joining her if you don\u2019t stop this asshole behaviour.

My wife has left our business cus of broken leg so she can help with the cooking for my sister.\n\nSince the start of the year my wife been wanting Dyson Air thing for Hair(I don\u2019t get the excitement) and yes I bought her the gift in November for xmas and I wrapped it and put it in our garage. Few days ago my sister was wrapping gifts for xmas and asked me what I got for my wife I told her its a Dyson Hair product and a Gucci perfume(around \u00a3700 in total) my sister got excited for my sister but sad again and said she wanted Dyson Hair product too and used to beg her husband to buy it for but he never did. Apparently he gifted the Dyson to his now GF. This obviously made me sad so I wanted to buy her another Dyson hair product same as my wife. I also had wrapped shoes for my sister for xmas. I went to different stores but it was sold out (my luck) I looked online and it would only be delivered after xmas. Because there was no option for my sister I just removed the name sticker and put my sisters name gifted the Dyson I bought for my wife to my sister. Keep this in mind I bought my wife extra gucci perfume she STILL got the gift. \n\nAnd yesterday I gave everyone their gift and everyone was happy!! Until my mum told me that she saw my wife\u2019s face during the gift giving and my wife looked hurt apparently and asked me why I didn\u2019t gift my wife the Dyson instead? (I thought she was happy with the gift perfume I gave) I told my mum the truth and my mother is calling me an A-hole. My parents wanted to buy my wife Dyson hair for xmas but asked me before they bought it so I told them I was going to buy it for my wife. So they thought I\u2019d actually give it to my wife and not change the plan last min.\n\nNow my mum told our aunty too snd she thinks I was a-hole too. I told them I will buy my wife again cus we will have plenty of time but they think it won\u2019t be the same as \u201cxmas magic\u201d so aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Again, you are a little too soft-hearted for your own good.\n\nDivorce is a really traumatic time, so it's understandable that you feel protective of your sister. Your wife deserves high praise for going along with the situation despite the inconvenience You really owe her one and should be going out of your way to make her life easier by helping out as much as you can, being extra nice, bringing home take-out instead of expecting her to cook every day and helping with any household chores you can manage. \n\nIt would help if you could put a time limit on how long this situation will last, so your wife can see a light at the end of the tunnel.

As I stated before, that's not really a gift...just the granting of a wish.  Christmas complicates the situation, as we often feel obligated to try to manufacture a valid reason for giving a gift because of tradition.  How do you know the wife had her heart set on the gift?   That would assume she knew she was receiving the gift.  But she did not know that.   And she would have been AH to make assumptions about it.  Sister did not manipulate him.  They had a conversation.  It was his idea to give her the hair thingie.\n\nIf you tell me you want a Playstation 8 for Christmas.  OK, noted.  Don't assume that you will get a Playstation 8 for Christmas or that the Playstation 8 will be something that I (personally) obtained for you, wrapped it up and put it under the tree with your name on it.  If you don't get a Playstation 8 at all, it would be immature to get upset over that.

She should be on equal footing, not above his family.  If a man's wife and mother are both drowning, and he can only save one, who should he save?  His mother of course.  You only get one mother.  Who is a wife?  Some woman you lusted after and fell in love with?  That's fine and dandy until she falls out of love with you or fucks another man.\n\nFamily is forever, they are loyal to each other, the love is unconditional.
