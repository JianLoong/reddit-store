When OPs sisters wedding arrives OP can make it all about themselves\n\n \u201cOmg you didn\u2019t know I got married?\u201d \u201cOf course you can look at my ring\u201d \u201clook at these pictures of the waterfall\u201d \u201cyou know me, just so quirky that I had to have an impromptu wedding unlike sisters big affair, aren\u2019t I so unique?\u201d \u201cOur honeymoon was so much fun, the food was so much better than sisters wedding food\u201d", "I was already leaning YTA and this comment solidified my stance. It\u2019s pretty wild they\u2019ve just up and decided to get married *right now.* and of course if the bride sister asked for their marriage to be kept quiet, she\u2019d be called out for \u201cnot supporting\u201d their sibling.", "Bingo Bango YTA OP", "Right, like how did the sisters know if they were expressly not invited? I guess the parents, in which case, there you go, it's not going to be a secret", "I keep seeing people comment, \"why can't you get married AFTER your sister?\" And I'm like, \"did you guys not see the line about the waterfall?\"\n\nOP deserves to have a pretty wedding too, even if it's tiny, and season plays a big role in that.\n\n\nIt could be as simple as they like the number 8 (August is the 8th month). Or it's an important anniversary for them and they want that date. If they waited, they'd have to wait a whole year.\n\nMy husband and I got married on Feb 29th, so it had to be then and not later or even next year.", "Yep. Some crazy responses first in line here", "Finally, a sane response.", "I'm sure you and everyone who agrees with you will get a bunch of down votes but I'm so glad I saw your comment.  I've been really questioning this sub with most of the comments I've seen. \"Op definitely wants the attention!\" \"Op definitely chose now so that she can steal her sister's spotlight!\" This sub is back at it", "I\u2019m so surprised at the responses. If this was posted from Bride Sister\u2019s pov, everyone would be calling her TA for acting entitled, and like she gets to claim the whole year for her wedding, and no one can have any significant moments anywhere near her wedding. No one wins here lol", "[removed]", "It\u2019s horrifically tacky. They OP doesn\u2019t want to pay for or arrange a reception, so they\u2019re leeching onto the sister\u2019s.

Not cricket!", "It\u2019s about what will happen at OP\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding. A wedding OP\u2019s sister is paying for is not the time or place to reveal life changing news but that\u2019s exactly what will happen if OP gets married before her. It\u2019s petty nonsense but I think that\u2019s the gist.", "[removed]", "Exactly! \n\nAs long as you make a point to not have it draw attention away from her on her wedding day, then who cares! \n\nIf we tried to schedule our life events around other people's, noone would ever get anything done. \n\nNot everyone decides \"yup I want to get married, and I want to wait a year to do it\" sometimes you just decide now is right. And you're literally just sneaking off with your parents and best friend. \n\nHonestly it sounds wonderful.

The parents are still perfectly able to attend and participate in their other daughters wedding that is months away.", "I think about my own siblings doing this, and while it might annoy me, I think it would be extreme to uninvite them and cut contact over it.", "More like their parents already planned to visit, so why not get it done?", "Or OP could wait until after her sister's wedding to get married and avoid this whole thing, but doesn't want to all of a sudden.", "Exactly, it wasn't going to stay a secret, especially since the younger sister (the teenager) probably still lives at home. And even if they don't do a big announcement, it's going to get spread around and family and friends will want to talk about it the next time they see her.

She can\u2019t do it two months before\u2026 how long would be deemed appropriate to wait? And then she has to risk parents not being able to come because of weather if it\u2019s anywhere snowy.

No one gets a prize for being the first one to get married.", "We don't know if the parents would need to travel, as the only fact is the sister is across the country, not that the parents are.

Maybe I\u2019m guesting at weddings wrong, but we just have fun and aren\u2019t hyper focused on the couple the whole\u2026 if someone were engaged or pregnant or recently, it would be like wow! Congrats moving on. Cannot imagine how uncomfortable our own wedding would be if people tried to fill the time talking about us.", "It\u2019s likely that the sisters wedding will be the first time she\u2019s encountering extended family or people they haven\u2019t seen in awhile. It would be dense to assume that OP will get no attention at her sisters wedding for her engagement, especially because they are family and have the same relatives.", "There\u2019s a huge difference between catching up and making a fuss. When people get married or have babies, those around them tend to make a fuss especially if it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen the person since the big news was revealed. If OP does this, her family is going to spend most of her sister\u2019s wedding weekend making a fuss over her which will take attention away from her sister. Since OP clearly doesn\u2019t like her sister, she\u2019s not going to refuse to discuss her marriage or show pictures in order to keep the spotlight on her sister. She\u2019s going to engage in those conversations and then try to gaslight her sister by saying she can\u2019t control how other people behave.", "So, wait, you think people will spend the entirety of OP's sister's wedding and reception focusing on OP because it'll be the first time they've all gotten together in some time \u2013 but they *won't* spend any time focusing on OP's sister, even though it'll be the first time they've all gotten together in some time, and despite the fact that OP's sister's wedding will, in fact, be the reason they've all gotten together?\n\nOr are you under the impression that every guest at every wedding spends every second with all their energy focused entirely on the bride and groom, and absolutely nothing else? Because, personally, I have never attended a wedding where that happened. In my experience, people who haven't seen each other in a while enjoy catching up, and therefore spend most of their time talking about all manner of subjects (mostly themselves and the people to whom they are speaking, and perhaps mutual friends who couldn't make it), and comparatively little time talking about the bridal couple.", "16 years ago I found out/ I was pregnant like a week before my cousin's husband died.
