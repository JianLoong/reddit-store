Hope this helps!", "Thank you, that was indeed my point. Women\u2019s fears about SA are often portrayed as paranoia. Given that 1 in 6 adult women has been the victim of attempted or completed sexual assault (according to RAINN), it\u2019s pretty likely that EVERY SINGLE WOMEN either knows someone who has been raped or has been raped herself. So it\u2019s reasonable for a woman to be concerned when she\u2019s in a strange man\u2019s car and he\u2019s creeping on her. \n\nAs a male survivor of sexual assault I deal with a fraction of the prejudice and risk that woman do, but in survivors groups I\u2019ve heard lots of women\u2019s stories. Screw the notion that men have some sort of right to sexually appreciate a woman they don\u2019t know, ogle her, chat about her to friends, etc. that\u2019s gross, and it\u2019s not complementary."]}
