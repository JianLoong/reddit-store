He's been living there since he got a job here last year. They co-own the apartment, but he decided to sell his share and move out before the wedding. Ann wanted him to move sooner so they could remodel the apartment to be more \"her taste\", this would spark a lot of arguments between them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week my godmother called me, she was very disappointed with my behavior and wanted to talk to me. She said she was expecting me in the bridal shower that afternoon and I didn't showed up, just like in Ann's bachelorette party. I showed her my phone and there was no invitation to go to either events, in which I had no idea they were happening or when. I told her about the cold shoulder I would get every time I was doing something with them and it wouldn't surprise me they wanted to have a party without me to be more comfortable among themselves, it wouldn't bother me if they had not lied about me refusing to participate out of spite for Ann. She promised me she wasn't going to talk to either Ann nor Tom about it because I did not want to create drama.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Monday Tom called me asking \"what's going on\". His mother and Ann had a huge argument over the apartment renovation (again) and after Ann saying something like \"it would had be done sooner if Jim had moved to a hotel sooner\". My godmother blew up which prompt Ann to admit she never wanted us in the bridal party. Tom was angry at me for not letting him know I was being treated badly before things got to that point. I told him I didn't want to add to his plate and create more arguments around the wedding, but since Ann never wanted me as bridesmaid I'd step down. I knew Jim wanted to step down long ago because of the arguments around him moving, he didn't for Tom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow Ann's friends are calling me an AH for stepping down so close to the wedding as \"revenge\" on Ann.

Since Tom and I were never romantically (even platonically) involved our friendship was never an issue. \n\nAnn knows that our family goes way back when my grandparents and his grandparents moved to the same street. They were neighbors. Our fathers and uncles are close friends ever since, we all grew up like cousins and \u2018till today when it comes to Christmas we celebrate as a crazy blended family. Things were ok between us, or so I though. I knew she had a problem with living in the same house with Jim and she wanted to move in before the wedding. They fought a lot for months about it, sometimes I think that I got caught up in their mess just for being paired with Jim, but sometimes I think that she disliked me because I didn\u2019t agree with her that the brothers should not buy a place together\u2026 (at the time I thought I had no say in that: 1) I wasn\u2019t going to pay, 2) I wasn\u2019t going to live there, 3) I wasn\u2019t going to marry either of them)\n\nI hope our friendship survives it, as well as his friendship with his favorite brother, and with his mother.
