He's been living there since he got a job here last year. They co-own the apartment, but he decided to sell his share and move out before the wedding. Ann wanted him to move sooner so they could remodel the apartment to be more \"her taste\", this would spark a lot of arguments between them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week my godmother called me, she was very disappointed with my behavior and wanted to talk to me. She said she was expecting me in the bridal shower that afternoon and I didn't showed up, just like in Ann's bachelorette party. I showed her my phone and there was no invitation to go to either events, in which I had no idea they were happening or when. I told her about the cold shoulder I would get every time I was doing something with them and it wouldn't surprise me they wanted to have a party without me to be more comfortable among themselves, it wouldn't bother me if they had not lied about me refusing to participate out of spite for Ann. She promised me she wasn't going to talk to either Ann nor Tom about it because I did not want to create drama.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Monday Tom called me asking \"what's going on\". His mother and Ann had a huge argument over the apartment renovation (again) and after Ann saying something like \"it would had be done sooner if Jim had moved to a hotel sooner\". My godmother blew up which prompt Ann to admit she never wanted us in the bridal party. Tom was angry at me for not letting him know I was being treated badly before things got to that point. I told him I didn't want to add to his plate and create more arguments around the wedding, but since Ann never wanted me as bridesmaid I'd step down. I knew Jim wanted to step down long ago because of the arguments around him moving, he didn't for Tom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow Ann's friends are calling me an AH for stepping down so close to the wedding as \"revenge\" on Ann.

And IMO it sounds like it would be best for Tom to \u2018step down\u2019 from his engagement.", "NTA\u2026readers will want to know if the wedding will happen!!!! \n\nI hope not, the stress will never end for OP BFF. Cheaper to cancel everything than pay for divorce that could possibly be dragged out", "Not at all. YOU are NTA here. Ann is the asshole, but Tom is also a bit of the asshole because typically a Bride selects her own bridesmaids. It isn't the place of the Groom to be to push one of his female buddies into that position.\n\nI don't know that Jim should step down and abandon his brother as one of the Groomsmen, because they are brothers. But Tom should have made a point of telling Ann to knock it off with pressuring Jim to move out early. And unless Jim received payment from Tom to 'buy out his share', NOBODY should have been pressuring him to move out of a place he co-owned. Not even his brother's future wife.\n\nAnne's friends can suck rocks, and the one Tom should be angry with, is Ann, for being so mean to you.", "NTA - Tell Ann to kiss your ass \ud83d\ude06", "NTA. They treated you badly. Why would you stay in the wedding party? Ann seems like a piece of work", "NTA. Ann is jealous of her finacee's relationships and is trying to cast you and Jim as the villans. You are in a tricky situation, its almost always better to not create drama, but when you know someone is a straight up liar then you have to call them out. I unfortunately learned this the hard way TWICE and have two friends who ended up married to manipulative jerks who they may not have if they knew the truth. It sucks either way really... you are in a no-win situation here.", "NTA in any way shape or form, HOWEVER I would just suck it up and be her bridesmaid. Otherwise you will never have the type of peaceful superficial relationship with Ann that you will need going forward so that you will be able to co-exist when the situation requires it. If you don't she will be permanently alienated and it will severely limit and complicate your relationship with Tom.\n\nJust tell her you will do the wedding. Do the ceremony and pictures and make an excuse and leave the reception early if you wish. Sounds like you missed all the pre-wedding events already but if not, do not attend any of the those. Wedding only. Then take a long break from them while they settle in as a married couple and let things settle down.", "NTA. Why on earth do you need to apologize when she is TA all along? The logic!", "NTA. I get that you want to stay out if it. But he is marrying a toxic person that will suck the life out if him. Please say something. You know i was a best man for my best friend. His wife to be was acting kinda like Ann. And i told him what i thought. He canceled his wedding through her out. And he didn't talk to me for like 2 months. Once he cleared his head he understood what i said was the best. Now he is married to a wonderful women i was his best man/women. And now we are in each others lives. Im the godmother to his little ones he is the best man or man of honor to mine. And his wife is ones of my best sisters from another mother", "YOU should apologize to ANN?! Is she high? Ann is clearly not a nice person, as evidenced by how she's treating the most important people in her husband's life. Please show him this post and the comments. I really hope he sees through Ann's bullshit and leaves her before he makes a huge, expensive mistake. What a b*tch! NTA.", "NTA. Your response should be  \u201cNo, unless she apologizes to me about never letting me know when the bridal shower and bachelorette party were scheduled \u201c.", "I'm about 99% sure I've read this before.  Almost exactly.", "I think you're being a bit generous to the fianc\u00e9e.", "It's already too late for Tom ... RIP", ">your Godmother assumed you were behaving badly\n\nyeah, that kinda bugs me--has Ann been laying the groundwork? please talk to your godmother", "NTA\n\nBut Op, is Tom even happy? Poor guy! \n\nIs he able to see this post or read back everything you have written? Is this lady the one for him? I only wonder if he could read his life story with Anne and see how much she is isolating his family/friends, maybe he can pause and take a look at his relationship.", "They're not married yet, it ain't too late!", "And she's a damned liar to boot?! Anything to get what she wants is manipulative and controlling. Abort, Tom. Abort! Send this one back where you found her.", ">Tom just want us (Jim and I) to do it for him\n\nI am very disappointed in Tom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "OP, while I get that you are trying to stay out of your best friend's drama. Part of being a best friend is telling a friend inconvenient truths sometimes. They are gonna get mad and probably not speak with you for a while, but they will never be able to say that you didn't render a warning. In this case, your wanting to 'stay out of it' is allowing your friend to commit to a relationship that is ultimately going to cause him great unhappiness. Ann is (as Diva-So-Rude stated so well) 'isolating Tom and erasing his identity'. She is lying to her MIL to be, she expected you to help her manipulate Tom into ousting his brother from the apartment, seeks her petty revenge because you're not messy, and is an all around waste of oxygen. This woman will suck the life out of him while destroying every good thing and relationship in his life. Say something. Tell Jim to say something. Tell your godmother to say something.  If he chooses to proceed, that's okay. But if I were his family and friends, there's no way I could not say something.", "NYA yes there is NO way Ann would have allowed Tom to have a groomswoman", "Tom even has more brothers than Jim and could only get 2/20 freaking people from his family and friends.", "What? Tom didn't get to choose his own best man?! \n\nFirst thought - Tom needs to grow a spine and put his foot down more. \n\nSecond thought - Ann is a bridezilla and this doesn't bode well for their future.", "Holy. Effing. Shit. That\u2019s insane, and your friend should run. That is SO VERY UNREASONABLE.", "I hope Tom gets away from Ann. He's going to be divorced in two years or less if he doesn't.", "Agreed. Being married is grand divorce is a hundred grand.", "What\u203d And force her to find two more unpartnered friends to match her and Jim! /s\n\nI say it sarcastically. But most of the groomsmen were apparently selected because they're the SOs of her bridesmaids, and Jim couldn't be best man because it would seperate her moh from her husband.\n\nIts no stretch of the imagination to think that is the exact reaction Ann would have had to such a suggestion.", "Missed the comment where OP mentioned other brothers. That just makes it even more messed up, potentially.\n\nI'm not one who feels siblings *have* to be part of someone's wedding party. Neither I or my brother included each other. And we were fine with it. Because we both had our own lives and knew that we were each selecting men we were close to. 20+ years on and I'm still close with my groomsmen.\n\nBut it really should be up to each person who they want standing up with them. Not getting 10% of the picks, like here. And only after having to push to get that much.\n\nI doubt the bride intended to give him *any* choices initially. It was probably going to be all her people. I also suspect OP and Jim were going to be at the back of the lineup if the bride had her way, once they were added."]}
