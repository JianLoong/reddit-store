His father was and is still very much involved. I knew she was divorced but didn't actually find out about her son until 4 months in. That should've been my first red flag but I thought being a single mom is hard when you're dating and you want to vet people before disclosing the child's existence. We got married a year later and had kids 1(K) and 3(R) years after getting married. \n\nBefore R, my wife was an excellent mother to both her and our kid. They had a sibling like relationship and I was like a cool uncle. Something after R was born, a switch went off and my wife became visibly distant to M. She started spending less time with him but didn't reduce the time she had him with us. I slowly started picking up the slack because I didn't want him to feel or be neglected at his own mother's house. \n\nThe sibling like bong between M and K started fading and R never had a bond like that to begin with. Both of them started to become somewhat like their mother and were openly upset on the days we had M. They even asked me openly why M had to keep coming over. I tried to balance them out the best I could but it was hard. All three were treated equally by me in all aspects which should've been my wife's job. Any time my wife planned on buying something for K and R, I had to quickly get something for M as well so he isn't left out or because what she got him was insultingly not equal. \n\nTeenage years were not kind and well, it got bad. Things were said and M cut us off and went full time with his Dad and Stepmom. I did my best to neutralize the hostility my kids had and mellow the situation out. M and I during this time still kept in touch and like with my kids, I went to his events and spent every other weekend with him quietly. For his 21st birthday, both his dad and I took him to our favorite bars and had a drink with him. Although he doesn't call me dad, he doesn't call me by name either and we just call each other buddy or other nicknames because we are family. My wife and her parents during this time just blamed her ex and his wife for poisoning M against \"us\" despite the fights we had regarding her ignoring him. M and my wife and kids have also talked their differences out with him so they have a cordial relationship but no where as close as it was when they were kids and the only reason he talks to my wife is because he doesn't want us to hang out secretly.\n\nWell few weeks ago, my wife found out that M is getting married and neither her or my kids are invited. She was not pleased with that. R and K, although understand their lack of invitation, are upset on behalf of their mother. To them she was the best mom ever and don't see any reason not to invite her. She also recently found out that stepmom is going as mother of groom while I am a groomsman. Now all hell has come loose and everyone is bashing us and especially me for not standing up for my wife. I mean she is his mother.

Your wife has deliberately blinded herself to the neglect & abuse she inflicted on M and the pain & damage it caused. I hope someday she is able to see that and apologize.
