His father was and is still very much involved. I knew she was divorced but didn't actually find out about her son until 4 months in. That should've been my first red flag but I thought being a single mom is hard when you're dating and you want to vet people before disclosing the child's existence. We got married a year later and had kids 1(K) and 3(R) years after getting married. \n\nBefore R, my wife was an excellent mother to both her and our kid. They had a sibling like relationship and I was like a cool uncle. Something after R was born, a switch went off and my wife became visibly distant to M. She started spending less time with him but didn't reduce the time she had him with us. I slowly started picking up the slack because I didn't want him to feel or be neglected at his own mother's house. \n\nThe sibling like bong between M and K started fading and R never had a bond like that to begin with. Both of them started to become somewhat like their mother and were openly upset on the days we had M. They even asked me openly why M had to keep coming over. I tried to balance them out the best I could but it was hard. All three were treated equally by me in all aspects which should've been my wife's job. Any time my wife planned on buying something for K and R, I had to quickly get something for M as well so he isn't left out or because what she got him was insultingly not equal. \n\nTeenage years were not kind and well, it got bad. Things were said and M cut us off and went full time with his Dad and Stepmom. I did my best to neutralize the hostility my kids had and mellow the situation out. M and I during this time still kept in touch and like with my kids, I went to his events and spent every other weekend with him quietly. For his 21st birthday, both his dad and I took him to our favorite bars and had a drink with him. Although he doesn't call me dad, he doesn't call me by name either and we just call each other buddy or other nicknames because we are family. My wife and her parents during this time just blamed her ex and his wife for poisoning M against \"us\" despite the fights we had regarding her ignoring him. M and my wife and kids have also talked their differences out with him so they have a cordial relationship but no where as close as it was when they were kids and the only reason he talks to my wife is because he doesn't want us to hang out secretly.\n\nWell few weeks ago, my wife found out that M is getting married and neither her or my kids are invited. She was not pleased with that. R and K, although understand their lack of invitation, are upset on behalf of their mother. To them she was the best mom ever and don't see any reason not to invite her. She also recently found out that stepmom is going as mother of groom while I am a groomsman. Now all hell has come loose and everyone is bashing us and especially me for not standing up for my wife. I mean she is his mother.

You see that sometimes where the bio Mi\n Shives her fits marriage kids aside when she has kids with new hubby.  Seldom does the stepfather step up.\nCongratulations!", "NTA. I'm impressed by you. You're more than a step-dad to M. Poor guy. If it weren't for, M would've been a dark and awful place. Imagine being rejected by a parent, that kind of pain is deep. Thank you for supporting him through all of that.", "NTA. She made her choice. Kudos to you for continuing to be there.", "NTA. But your marriage maybe in trouble.", "NTA. Why haven\u2019t you advocated for him? You\u2019re married to the woman and can clearly see she played favorites.", "NTA. What you did your stepson is amazing. Your wife made her bed. Now she gets to lay in it. Fleas and all.", "NTA - and buddy, there\u2019s still time to get out. She\u2019s manipulative and abandoned her kid.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m curious, are your younger kids both girls?", "Has she ever explained why she turned on M?", "OP should let the extended family know EXACTLY why M doesn\u2019t want egg donor ( cuz she sure AF isn\u2019t his mom) at the wedding. She deserves to deal with the consequences of abandoning her child. Good on OP for not following her awful treatment.", "I fully agree that OP has been a mensch of the highest order, for over 20 years, putting so much thought into making sure M feels loved despite steadily escalating neglect & abuse from OP's wife and siblings, and doing his best to maintain harmony in the family even after M had moved out and OP's wife & kids were badmouthing him behind his back. Doing that must have taken immense strength, empathy, and grace.\n\n...which is why I'm shocked that OP thought it was a good idea to try to hide and then lie about the fact that he was going to M's wedding, AS A GROOMSMAN, to his own wife & kids.\n\nOP, you're NTA and you should go to the wedding no matter what anyone tells you or what names they call you. Your wife has deliberately blinded herself to the neglect & abuse she inflicted on M and the pain & damage it caused. I hope someday she is able to see that and apologize. But as we often say here, weddings & holidays are not family therapy sessions. They are not opportunities for estranged relatives to try to force reunification or resolution. After everything M has been through, he deserves to have you there to support him on his wedding day, and after everything you've done for him, you deserve to be there to celebrate his happiness.\n\nI do have to wonder what good you thought would come from trying to hide your involvement in the wedding from your wife. Did you think she wouldn't ever find photos of the wedding party and see you in them? Hindsight is 20/20 I guess and there's no reason to dwell on it now, but I highly recommend you go to family counseling with your wife to talk about why you didn't feel safe telling her the truth about the wedding, \\*and\\* with your kids to talk about everything that happened with M and how to treat family members. Don't let these cycles of abuse & neglect get passed down to the next generation.", "Because the woman I married was great. To a certain extent she is still that person as a partner but just no longer as a mother. I guess I have hope that she will turn back into the person. It was so out of the blue too. I've asked her to see professionals but she denied it all.", "I know that pain all to well which is why I wanted to be there for him.", "This is insane. She abandoned her kid for her new family. OP as a step parent was the only one who maintained a connection. He doesn\u2019t owe loyalty to a shitty parent who abandoned her kid. You are out of your mind.", "NTA. Your wife needs therapy.", "It sounds like she hasn\u2019t been the ideal mother for the majority of her sons life so it appears you have been waiting for a miracle for a long time. Treating your child differently than another child is so damaging & she obviously has some sort of resentment when it comes to him. Enabling people and their behavior will not fix anything either. I feel so bad for her son but hopefully his stepmom took over the role as his mother. I hope she doesn\u2019t turn on your other kids or you, I\u2019ve seen it happen.", "Look, OP, I totally get why it's been hard to divorce the woman you loved, who was once-in your eyes-a great person. But it's time to take a stand. By staying married to this woman, you are basically publicly declaring \"I stand by this person and their actions.\" Your wife is a negligent, abusive parent, and by staying with her, you are saying you support that behavior, or at the very least will turn a blind eye to it. \n\nThink about it this way. If you made a new friend who you really liked and bonded well with, and then discovered they were racist, would you still be friends with them? Or would you say \"no, I do not want this awful person in my life?\" By staying with your wife, you are telling the ppl around you that you condone her behavior. \n\nFrankly, you're lucky M still likes you, but I have to wonder if it's a healthy relationship or if he's attatched to you bc you were the only person on his side at bio mom's house, and he developed a kind of codependent relationship with you bc of it. I mean, you realize how traumatizing it is to be knowingly hated by your own mother, especially when she once seemed to love you and only changed once she had another kid, right? So he probably clutched onto you like a lifeline, bc you were the only person for years who would care about him when he was at your place.", "She destroyed the relationship that the kids had with each other, made her first born run away from her. She sounds like a very toxic person and you have enabled that behavior for years.", "Please enlighten me. What did I miss?", "It has nothing to with the mom/kid. Kid/groom did nothing wrong. You don\u2019t lie & betray your wife & sneak off to her kid\u2019s wedding.\n\nEDIT - and expect to stay married. He chose his side.", "Well she is now his legal mom so she definitely took that role of mom.", "Probably did. We have had so many fights about M but at the same time, I'm the step parent so to her my say means less.", "Op isn\u2019t M\u2019s biodad, the whole first paragraph goes into how she \u2018hid\u2019 that she had M from OP when they first started their relationship. \n\nOp hasn\u2019t \u2018created\u2019 a situation, his wife has by neglecting her first born, he cut contact with her mother but kept contact with OP and ofc his biodad, so how can Op be TA here when wife his horrible to M and Op tried to mitigate as much as possible the neglect caused by wife.", "This is such a shit take on marriage. If I\u2019m wrong, I want my husband to tell me he thinks so, why, and potentially help me fix the issue before I make it worse. I also want to be able to tell my husband \u201cyou\u2019re wrong in this situation, here\u2019s why, I will not be supporting this action/decision.\u201d \n\nThe only people who want to be in marriages with \u201cyes\u201d men, are people who are incapable of self-reflection and growth.", "It 100% does. This kid isn\u2019t some interloper. OP helped raise the guy. This isn\u2019t some random relationship. Do you think OP should still be acting this way if the kid was biologically his? Because there is no difference. He was the only positive person in that house for the child.", "You are. But honestly your wife is not. I'm sorry. But she basically neglected her son. And you stayed married to her. You're doing right by M but your wife needs to own up to her part in all this\n\nNTA", "You are right, I missed that. But I think he\u2019s still complicit with the kid\u2019s mistreatment. And note the throw-away line about how the kid left to be full time with the other parent. I couldn\u2019t stay with someone who treated their own kid like that.", "What do you mean she's not his legal mom? I'm curious.", "Oh 100% but OP didn\u2019t do that. He snuck around, lied to his wife, let her create this massive wedge with her son\u2026\n\nA complete weenie. And he enabled it, then snuck off to her own son\u2019s wedding w/o a word, which NOT ONLY is being a complete weenie but also completely betraying his own wife & kids (yep yep that\u2019s what he did, which is why that\u2019s why they feel betrayed).", "Well, you know about adult adoptions? Well M kind of had one of those quietly with his stepmom..... My wife doesn't know about that yet. That is one of the worse things I'm guilty of hiding. I tell myself I'm shielding her from pain and avoiding a huge outburst but now I'm questioning everything I've done for M so far.", "NTA. You\u2019ve supported a kid who was abandoned by his mom. She threw him aside and is now facing consequences that you are hiding. This is all directly a result of her actions. You\u2019ve been the only reason why the door has been left open."]}
