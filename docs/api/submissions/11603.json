Although I had suspected David of abuse since he started dating my aunt, I did not want to ruin her chances of finding love, especially given her age and her nervousness about the prospect. However, after carefully reviewing the comments, I have formulated a plan of action for this situation. Since I still depend on them for my bills and college tuition, I have decided to invite only my aunt out to dinner tomorrow to return the jacket and have a conversation.

Consider returning the jacket when your aunt is home alone and talk about what happened while recording the conversation (if that is legal where you live).

Check it super thoroughly before you give it back. Do you know what days or times David works? Can you try to find a (subtle!) way to talk to your aunt alone? It really seems like he's trying to isolate her and she may end up needing help to get away from him. On average, people try to leave their abuser seven times, so if she leaves him but then goes back, please don't give up on her. Try to find a way to leave a line of communication open. Let her know that she can call or email you. When you contact her, be very careful what you put in writing. Assume that he might be reading her emails and texts. Assume that he might be listening in on her phone calls.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou Aunt gave you the jacket as a gift. I think you are right about her husband. You don't owe him an apology,  if anyone does, your Aunt does, however if your Aunt is agreeing with him, she may have been afraid to tell him she gave it to you.", "NTA. But, OP, if your aunt is still paying your way right now, I'd return the jacket and apologize. (Even though you did nothing wrong.) Then, I would keep your distance and make sure you have a game plan if she pulls funding. It sounds like your aunt is blinded to anything other than him, which must be heartbreaking because your aunt is basically your mom.\n\nI would get into therapy and find a way to accept the fact that your relationship is changing, and your aunt has chosen this man over you. Keep that in mind for the future, if he leaves her, or she needs you. If she doesn't care about you any longer, you're not obligated to care about her.", "She lied to both of them.", "Because he's a man and so some people here naturally want to paint him as some villain.", "I think they meant trying to sell it to people who can\u2019t afford it (OP) instead of through the normal ways you\u2019d resell designer goods.", "I wasn't suggesting it's natural behaviour for humans... but it is for predators. I thought my inference was pretty clear. Obviously not.", "I thought of that too:\n- why the move? My mind keeps whispering worst case scenarios like he got caught with a patient and is outrunning the scandal (which make me feel terrible, bc there's nothing in the post justifying that)\n- does she have an equivalent job lined up in their new location?", "That\u2019s really fucked up anyway, my friend. Many people say \u201cnatural\u201d to mean good, or excusable.", "[removed]", "I can see how an abusive spouse could manufacture this situation for alienation as well. I.E.: \n\nDavid: \"I'm having trouble finding buyers for some of these clothes, I'll just donate them\"\n\nAunt: \"Do you mind if I give something to OP?\"\n\nDavid: \"Sure\"\n\nThen when Aunt give OP the jacked David turns it around with something like: \"I didn't mean \\*that\\* jacket, OP has been taking advantage of you for so long and now he goes and picks out the most expensive thing in the pile. I've told you he's just trying to suck you dry and now he's trying to get \\*my\\* money too. He basically stole from me.\" Then after ranting for a while that turns into \"He stole from me! Do you have any idea how expensive that jacket was? I could press charges!\"", "bot", "I think this is a very likely scenario. And why would a rich man need to sell his clothes he doesn\u2019t want?  He shouldn\u2019t need to. There\u2019s definitely some very shady stuff that OP might not be knowing about.", ">why would a rich man need to sell his clothes he doesn\u2019t want?\n\nAnd even if he did ... what doctor has the time to track down individual buyers for each item of clothing rather than just taking them to a re-sell or consignment shop? This whole thing sounds like a setup.", "That\u2019s a good point too. Yes from all angles this very much feels setup!", "And it's clothes -- they're easy to pack up and move.", "My answer, your aunt said to you that David was trying to sell it and couldn't find a buyer for it, so she gives it to you. How can be that called stealing?", "NTA. OP, are you sure your aunt is not in a toxic and abusive relationship? It looks like she made up an entirely different story about what happened to David. Look for ways you can we as \"discreet or first stages to am abusive relationship\". It might not be physical (yet) but it sounds like emotional abuse. She's telling him another story to please him, so what will happen when they move and she has 0 support from people around her, a 0 support circle. I hope you can find a way to get rid of David, he sounds like a nightmare. Best of luck!", "Remind me! 1 day", "NTA.  Tell your aunt to fess up to the truth!  You know her true colors now.  Do not apologize.", "NTA\n\nBut, honestly, I'd just apologize for any misunderstandings to keep the peace and lines of communication open.", "No do not have this conversation with David there", "Have thought maybe it\u2019s the aunt that needs support now? She supported him all this time and now you want it to throw all in her face over a single inexplicable incident without even  trying to address it with her? That\u2019s being a psychopathic leach", "Try reading my original comment word for word. I now realise I should have expanded my meaning on 'natural', but I thought the whole tone of my comment would make it pretty obvious that this guy was controlling and manipulative. For that kind of predator, his actions are 'natural'.

Please give up and update on the update.\n\nI hope your aunt finds a way to be safe.", ">Also, how do we know that David is actually wealthy and not a con man?\n\nA more likely explanation is that he's a surgeon.

Isnt it common for abusers tk separate their victims from their support?", ">a psychopathic leach\n\nAre you alright?", "You are 100% NTA here, but I do have one piece of advise for you.  Even though it seems like your aunt is siding with David and the way she\u2019s acting right now can be very hurtful to you, when you return the jacket, tell her you love her and you\u2019ll be there for her any time she needs you.  If this really is an abusive relationship, the abusers rely on alienating their victim from everyone they love.  Having no one left but their abuser makes them feel like they have no choice but to stay.  As hurtful and frustrating as it is for you, please let her know she can still always turn to you.  That will hopefully allow her to get out sooner than later.  I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "I\u2019m not even rich and I can\u2019t be bothered to try to sell things.
