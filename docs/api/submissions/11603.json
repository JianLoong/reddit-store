Why didn\u2019t your aunt tell you they were moving - why did you hear it from David? Based on what you wrote, she clearly gave you the jacket, and no she says you owe him an apology. No. Don\u2019t apologise. The only one who should be apologising is your aunt. NTA", "NTA, if your aunt gave you the jacket then you can take it, chuck it in her face and tell her to apologize to you for the mess she created or own up to her partner. If she refuses, might be worth to just walk away minus the jacket as its better not to have such relatives.", "NTA not even close", "NTA, but give back the jacket for your own safety", "WOW!  Consider returning the jacket when your aunt is home alone and talk about what happened while recording the conversation (if that is legal where you live). I would normally never suggest someone record a private conversation but you need to be able to prove your innocence just in case David does decide to press charges.  NTA. \n\nYour aunt's reaction to this situation is concerning. She basically threw you under the bus rather than deal with her screwup herself.", "NTA - Your aunt specifically said David was trying to sell it and couldn't find a buyer for it, so give it to you. How in anyone's mind is that steeling? \n\nIf she asked for it back and said it was a mistake, then okay fair enough. But now she asks for an apology too?! Sounds like she's given a different story about it to David tbh. Whether that's intentional or not, I don't know.", "NTA. Your aunt needs to be honest about what happened.", "NTA. I wonder if David is abusing OP's aunt and maybe that's why she didn't say anything. Things aren't adding up. Maybe he's trying to alienate your aunt. I would suggest giving him the jacket back but first have a conversation with your aunt. Ask her why she didn't say what happened is she afraid? She may not say it but look for her non verbal ways she communicates. You have known her for 18 years.", "NTA but we\u2019re seeing the steps of abuse right here\u2026 isolation, moving out of state without warning, trying to drive a wedge between her and her family/support system\u2026 \n\nIs her self-esteem the same that it was before? \nIs she a bit more on edge than before?\n\nAlso, how do we know that David is actually wealthy and not a con man? \n\nI would keep an eye out because the easiest thing to do after they move is to move again and never be reachable.", "NTA: I\u2019m confused about the end? Why isn\u2019t your aunt sticking up for you- she gave you the jacket, right? Why do you have to apologise now??\n\nCan you maybe check in with your aunt alone- rather than when David is around?", "NTA and if David IS trying to put a wedge between you and aunt, he'll be really loving all this and ramping it up to drive a further wedge, just explain you thought it was gifted and will give it back", "Nta , this is your aunts problem.", "NTA He needs an apology from your aunt. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA Give the jacket back ASAP but don\u2019t deal with this guy. He\u2019s your aunts problem.", "NTA and you don't owe him an apology.", "I agree that the aunt told a different story. If I were OP, I would want to out my aunt for lying. I don't actually recommend that though unless OP doesn't care about how his aunt would react.", ">and my aunt agrees\n\nSeems you have already lost your aunt to a manipulator. They are moving to another state for the same reason.\n\nNTA. Throw the jacket back at them.", "NTA - The jacket should be returned, obviously, but absolutely no apology necessary. Try not to judge your aunt, it seems she's got enough problems and is scared of this guy.\n\nHis reaction to you is natural. Male lion takes over a pride and immediately kills the male cubs that his mate already has. This guy has managed to get rid of you and is now isolating your aunt even further.", "NTA but what is wrong with your aunt!? Giving it to you and then expecting you apologize for stealing it?", "It was a miscommunication. Give the jacket back and explain what you were told. Don't trust the aunt moving forward with gifts unless he is okay with it too.NTA", "It is stealing, just not on OP\u2019s part. \n\nThe aunt is the thief in this situation. It wasn\u2019t her jacket to give away.", "NTA. Give it back but don\u2019t apologize.", "NTA if she clearly told you you could have it, it is not your fault and you did not steal it. Return it, but there is no need to apologize for anything.\nPlease try to keep in contact with her aunt and be there for her if she needs you, this whole relationship sounds a little fishy.", "What 60 year old doctor is running around trying to pawn off 1000 dollar jackets to folks that are obviously going to have a hard time affording it?? NTA but David sounds like a weird asshole, tell him to get bent and stop acting like a freak", "NTA. Why would your aunt expect you to apologize? Be clear and direct: \"Here's your jacket. Aunt gave this to me and said I could have it. If you didn't want her to give it away, that sounds like a problem between the two of you.\"", "Go give the jacket back. Thank your Aunt for being a parent for you growing up. Tell her that you'll miss her and she can always call you if she needs anything, and wish her well.. Don't apologize. Don't accuse. Leave and, sadly, don't look back.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nReturn it and say \"I am sorry that I took my aunt at her word when she said I could take the jacket you had been unable to find a buyer for, I only took this jacket because my aunt was gifting the jacket.\nI wish you luck finding someone to buy it as if you spent 1k on this, personally I think you overpaid.\"", "NTA  I'd return it and say \"I'm sorry my aunt freely gave me this jacket while I was helping her pack.\"  Because really, don't you regret having to deal with this whole situation?", "Why do you need to apologise for a mistake that your aunt made????\n\nNTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGive the jacket back, tell him she gave it to you, but DON'T apologise because you did nothing wrong!", "LOL NTA\n\nAunt: Here take this jacket!\n\nYou: Ok.\n\nAunt: You need to give that back and apologize.", "Soft YTA. Just give back the jacket.", "Your aunt didn\u2019t have permission to give away someone else\u2019s jacket. You knew he was trying to sell it and didn\u2019t have his consent. I think ESH .", "I thought the exact same thing and I wonder if she\u2019s scared of him in some way  due to her backpedaling and now demanding OP apologise? Either she\u2019s after an apology now to cover her arse so she won\u2019t sit in the doghouse or something else is going on. This whole David thing stinks", "Something feels off about this. Like if the aunt is being abused and tries to hide what she did, or was getting OP in trouble deliberately. I get weird vibes.", "Check in on your aunt *alone*, something is very wrong here, and I worry for her. She's your guardian, she's your *parent*. \n\n\nPlease \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta. Your aunt needs to step up and tell this dude that SHE gave you the jacket. She clearly is letting him think you stole it....maybe she was nervous by his reaction or something, but you don't deserve to be yelled at for your aunts fuck up. I would talk to her and find out why she isn't defending you and figure out your next step from there.", "Apologize for what?", ">and my aunt agrees\n\nIs she not acknowledging that she gave it to you? \n\nIf that's the case, I'd just start distancing myself from both of them.", "Your aunt agrees? Why? Have you tried asking her privately what's going on?", "NTA - \"I am so sorry that I believed my aunt when she said you were doing something kind and generous. I should have known that she was looking at you with rose tinted glasses, and I will not allow myself to be fooled about you again.\"", "NTA your aunt threw you under the bus", "NTA. But if this string of events correct then your aunt might be in over her head with a man who is very controlling. If your aunt can flip like this over a clothing item what else could David be making her do? Could this move even be a result of him dictating and not a joint agreement? OP there may be more to this. Return the jacket but DO NOT apologise since you didn't steal it. Your aunt might need a reminder that you don't have to give in to bullies.", "Don't apologize.\n\nNTA", "Why should you apologize for accepting a gift?  And now your aunt isn't even sticking up for you & telling him that she gave it to you?  They're both AH's.  Return that jacket & cut ties.  NTA", "You don't need to apologize, your aunt was the one in the wrong here. \n\nShe might have been a good aunt before but the fact that she's not only not defending you, but insisting you apologize for her mistake, shows that she's no longer the aunt you once loved.\n\nI strongly suggest you work on getting independent and consider going nc. I'm so sorry you have to go through this, NTA.", "Do this. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that aunt lied to me/was misinformed, and gave the jacket to me as a gift. I have returned the jacket, as it is clear this was not what was intended. I will not apologize for taking the jacket, under misguided assumptions from aunt. I will not be in touch beyond this. \n\nNTA.", "lol, there's always one. Like how in god's name did you come to that conclusion?", "I can imagine a scenario where David did say she could give his stuff away and is now gaslighting her into saying he didn\u2019t. Abusers like to create opportunities to keep their victims walking on eggshells.", "The mum gave her a jacket she shouldn't have. OP should just give the jacket back and not get involved in their stupid games.", "I get this vibe. Like when he looked for the jacket, she got scared and had to make up a story. I hope she\u2019s ok.\n\nNTA", "This:(", "Yup. Move OP out Could have just been for newlywed privacy. However, now she's being moved away from her family. Seems like an escalation of alienation. \nNTA"]}
