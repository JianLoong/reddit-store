Why didn\u2019t your aunt tell you they were moving - why did you hear it from David? Based on what you wrote, she clearly gave you the jacket, and no she says you owe him an apology. No. Don\u2019t apologise. The only one who should be apologising is your aunt. NTA", "NTA, if your aunt gave you the jacket then you can take it, chuck it in her face and tell her to apologize to you for the mess she created or own up to her partner. If she refuses, might be worth to just walk away minus the jacket as its better not to have such relatives.", "NTA not even close", "NTA, but give back the jacket for your own safety", "WOW!  Consider returning the jacket when your aunt is home alone and talk about what happened while recording the conversation (if that is legal where you live). I would normally never suggest someone record a private conversation but you need to be able to prove your innocence just in case David does decide to press charges.  NTA. \n\nYour aunt's reaction to this situation is concerning. She basically threw you under the bus rather than deal with her screwup herself.", "NTA - Your aunt specifically said David was trying to sell it and couldn't find a buyer for it, so give it to you. How in anyone's mind is that steeling? \n\nIf she asked for it back and said it was a mistake, then okay fair enough. But now she asks for an apology too?! Sounds like she's given a different story about it to David tbh. Whether that's intentional or not, I don't know.", "NTA. Your aunt needs to be honest about what happened.", "NTA. I wonder if David is abusing OP's aunt and maybe that's why she didn't say anything. Things aren't adding up. Maybe he's trying to alienate your aunt. I would suggest giving him the jacket back but first have a conversation with your aunt. Ask her why she didn't say what happened is she afraid? She may not say it but look for her non verbal ways she communicates. You have known her for 18 years.", "NTA but we\u2019re seeing the steps of abuse right here\u2026 isolation, moving out of state without warning, trying to drive a wedge between her and her family/support system\u2026 \n\nIs her self-esteem the same that it was before? \nIs she a bit more on edge than before?\n\nAlso, how do we know that David is actually wealthy and not a con man? \n\nI would keep an eye out because the easiest thing to do after they move is to move again and never be reachable.", "NTA: I\u2019m confused about the end? Why isn\u2019t your aunt sticking up for you- she gave you the jacket, right? Why do you have to apologise now??\n\nCan you maybe check in with your aunt alone- rather than when David is around?", "NTA and if David IS trying to put a wedge between you and aunt, he'll be really loving all this and ramping it up to drive a further wedge, just explain you thought it was gifted and will give it back", "Nta , this is your aunts problem.", "NTA He needs an apology from your aunt. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA Give the jacket back ASAP but don\u2019t deal with this guy. He\u2019s your aunts problem.", "NTA and you don't owe him an apology.", "I agree that the aunt told a different. If I were OP, I would want to out my aunt for lying. I don't actually recommend that though unless OP doesn't care about how his aunt would react."]}
