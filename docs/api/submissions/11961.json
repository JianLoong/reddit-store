{"id": 11961, "submission_id": "11nto2j", "title": "AITA for not helping my wife with the kids when she wanted to keep them home from daycare and I have to work?", "selftext": "So my wife and I have two kids. One who is a bit over 2 years old and another that is 5 months old. I work Monday to Friday 9-5 from home, occasionally go in to the office. My wife is on maternity leave and taking care of the 5 month old. I take care of the baby for over night wakings and feedings.\n\nThe 2 year old is in daycare. Whether I send my kid to daycare 1 day or 5 days a week for 1 hour or 8 it costs the same. My wife likes to pick up our toddler from daycare around 3:15 everyday instead of letting me go when I finish work because she doesn't want our kid to be there so much during the day. The problem is I am left watching the baby for the 45 minutes while she is gone and then for the hour that she is taking care of both of them she gets overwhelmed, stressed, very annoyed at me and our kids, it's just not great overall.\n\nEvery day my wife tells me that she is exhausted, she has no time to herself she doesn't get things done that she needs to, she's overwhelmed, just wants to relax when the baby naps etc... I try to help out with the baby during the day when I can, like feeding and putting him down during my lunch break. I just try to be available throughout the day if my wife needs me.\n\nAnyways, on to the main point of this post. Last night my wife tells me she wants to keep the toddler home from daycare today. I told her that I didn't think it was a good idea. How was she going to feed and put the baby down for a nap while taking care of toddler? She already gets stressed and overwhelmed just looking after the baby. Why put herself through more stress? I told her that I could not take the day off of work and she would be alone taking care of both kids. She said she really wanted to spend time with both kids and felt like she doesn't see our toddler enough. Fine, no problem, if she wants to do this it is up to her, I reiterated that I would not be around to help.\n\nCut to this morning, I got up at midnight and 4 am to take care of the baby. I get both kids ready and made breakfast for everyone.\n\nI start work and sure enough, 20 minutes after I started, I hear my wife trying to tell our toddler that she just needs to go in the other room to put the baby down for a nap. Of course the toddler doesn't want to leave her side, toddler starts crying. I can hear my wife getting frustrated. Wife finally leaves to put baby down and comes back. She now has to juggle going back and forth trying to settle the baby by putting the pacifier back in (we are starting some sleep training) and the toddler who wants all of her attention.\n\nFinally baby gets settled, wife is obviously stressed and tired and it is 9:45am... She comes in to my office where I am working and asks did I not hear her struggling? Why did I not come and help.\n\nAITA for telling my wife I told you so, that I said I would not be around to help and this is what you get? That she should have let me bring our toddler to daycare?", "created_utc": 1678465653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nto2j/aita_for_not_helping_my_wife_with_the_kids_when/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From my reading of this post, it doesn't sound like you're slacking on any parenting duties. Sounds like you are definitely contributing.\n\nIf you worked out of the home, she wouldn't have been able to rely on you for being around.

Drop the toddler off on your way there and pick them up at the end of the work day. If your wife wants to keep them home all day, that's on her, but I would arrange to go into the office those days because I think right now (and this is probably just due to sleep deprivation) she's treating you being home as available for daddy duty, rather than that you are \"at work\" from 9-5 and she should be keeping the older kiddo in daycare since you guys are fortunate to have that as an option.", "NTA. whether you are at home or in the office, you are WORKING.

This is 100% on me and that time I am the one who\u2018s supposed to do all the \u201ework\u201c related to our daughter.

She is on leave to care for the children, the toddler has day care so she doesn't get overwhelmed, she needs to come up with a system and stick to it, and it can't involve interrupting your work.

You can't be interrupted constantly just because you're home.", "NTA.... But there are ways to involve the older baby and incorporate/ enlist their help with the younger one. My first baby was super cooperative, and would not fuss if I had to leave her alone and go to the little one when he started crying. She is 1.5 years older than him, so not that much older than him. Maybe you guys will learn with more experience. All in all, it would help to have clearer communication if (after your workday), you guys could sit peacefully and strategize how things could be handled differently next time to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. For instance, one possible scenario could be that the older sis helps during baby's nap time by quietly being in the room, maybe stroking baby's hair till it fell asleep. That way she would feel she helped / contributed, and would be calm. Hope this helps.", "NTA. \nBut you might want to consider working in the office more if working from home is going to cause these issues.", "NTA.

On one hand, your wife is on maternity leave and struggling to find a balance.  I understand that.  But, on the other hand, you are the only one making a living at the moment to pay bills and put food on the table.  I have been in your shoes.  You, sir, do your best with the situation you are given.  You try to help out when you are free.  Good on you.  I don't see any good reason for her to attack you while you are working.  You did tell her it would be a bad idea when you are working, to put undue stress on herself.  It's good that you care for your wife.  I don't see any issue here.  Perhaps your wife might have post partum depression, which might explain the stress and frustration.  But, when you are on the clock, work comes first.  Risking your job would be a bad idea.", "Jesus NTA.  This is the same kind of logic a woman applies when she lets herself get pregnant to force the relationship into a marriage.\n\nYour wife is ignoring what you are saying and trying to get you to do what she wants and has envisioned.", "NAH your wife is suffering from mom guilt which a societal pressure to do everything all at once with a smile and high efficiency. It's ridiculous and unreasonable but still a valid emotion that you might understand as well. Instead of the complete logical approach of trying to prove your point, take into consideration that your youngest isn't even 5 months so hormones & stress are playing a part in this.\n\nTalk to your wife to see how to handle this as a team. Offer some empathy to see if she'll open up about *why* she wants to keep putting this pressure on herself. Remind her that she's the backbone of the house and if she's stressed/overwhelmed then things crumble. Give her space to take care of herself so she can be the best mom she wants to be. \n\nBut if you do the \"I told you so\" game it will cause resentment all around and everyone loses.", "NAH. It's not your fault or your wife's. Like most mothers wants her kids to be near her most of the time and she is not thinking this through. Maybe you're due for a long conversation including couples counseling", "ESH\n\nI would say NAH, but wife was accusing you of being a bad partner when you have other obligations that were well communicated. Emergency, yes, of course you would set in.  This was not an emergency. \n\nYou get a bit of heat for saying \"i told you so\".  99% (my real, made up number), is because of some sort of social validation/shaming game that moms put upon themselves.  Moms shit on other moms, and shit on themselves, when they use the tools at their disposal to make parenting less of a chore.  BTDT.  You get in your own head about what is \"the right way\" vs \"what actually works\".  It tends to be a series of failures of some sort of fucked up goal in your mind and then feel guilty because as a mom you can't manage it. \n\nI think your wife sincerely wanted to hang out with both of the children and reality sucked ass.  But i think your wife set herself up with unreasonable goals& high expectations. It is ok if children are crying & it is not a reflection on her as a parent. Having your kid in daycare 5 vs 4 days isn't some mommy failure (there is a lot of guilt & shame about sending a kid to daycare when you don't HAVE to, which is ridiculous). \n\nEveryone is learning their limits here.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like you have work, which is obviously a priority.  It also sounds like your wife might like to get comfortable with juggling both kids at once\n\n\nHere is something me and my husband learned early on.  Sometimes when I vent, I don't want him to tell me the easiest solution (in your case, keeping the toddler in preschool full day, 5 days a week).  Sometimes, I just want my husband to listen or even ask \"what can I do to help?\" Maybe you can't watch either child during the workday but maybe you can offer her some alone time after work. \n\nI remember it feeling really hard when I had an infant and a toddler. And as a mom, sometimes you worry what if the toddler is feeling pushed aside.", "NAH it\u2019s just a tough time and a lot pressure. Can you see why it would make her feel guilty to send the toddler away when she is at home and presumably able to care for them?  Worrying that they might feel replaced and really, a toddler is a baby - it\u2019s hard to be away from them! On top of that, There are people who can\u2019t afford daycare or somehow do manage to take care of multiple babies at once - and that\u2019s great for them - but knowing that can feel like pressure to be able to do the same. Like you are being a bad mom because you couldn\u2019t make it work. So I hear you on this being self inflicted, but try to acknowledge that it isn\u2019t just a logic-based decision. It\u2019s emotional too.", "Soft YTA for saying \u201cthis is what you get and I told you so.\u201d But you are correct. Your wife clearly needs help and it seems like she wants to keep them home instead of sending them to daycare. Have you thought about a mommy\u2019s helper/nanny that can help in the home instead of sending your toddler to daycare?", "Everyone and no one is an AH if they have a 5 month old. With the exception of a rare few 5 month old infants, they don't let anyone get any sleep. This leads to all sorts of communication breakdowns and strife between the parents. \n\nYour reasoning is completely sound. Your wife is a normal human. So, I'm going to guess that her level of exhaustion is preventing her from hearing your message and taking the kids to daycare, and I know based on what you wrote (the number of times you are up at night and the \"I told you so\"s) that your level of exhaustion is preventing you from communicating your message with any form of empathy.\n\nLong story short: you both need a break. Get a grandparent or hire someone for a 24 hr period so that you can both get some uninterrupted sleep. Then, if and only if you've both had 6+ hrs of uninterrupted sleep, readdress the childcare issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
