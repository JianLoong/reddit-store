{"id": 11961, "submission_id": "11nto2j", "title": "AITA for not helping my wife with the kids when she wanted to keep them home from daycare and I have to work?", "selftext": "So my wife and I have two kids. One who is a bit over 2 years old and another that is 5 months old. I work Monday to Friday 9-5 from home, occasionally go in to the office. My wife is on maternity leave and taking care of the 5 month old. I take care of the baby for over night wakings and feedings.\n\nThe 2 year old is in daycare. Whether I send my kid to daycare 1 day or 5 days a week for 1 hour or 8 it costs the same. My wife likes to pick up our toddler from daycare around 3:15 everyday instead of letting me go when I finish work because she doesn't want our kid to be there so much during the day. The problem is I am left watching the baby for the 45 minutes while she is gone and then for the hour that she is taking care of both of them she gets overwhelmed, stressed, very annoyed at me and our kids, it's just not great overall.\n\nEvery day my wife tells me that she is exhausted, she has no time to herself she doesn't get things done that she needs to, she's overwhelmed, just wants to relax when the baby naps etc... I try to help out with the baby during the day when I can, like feeding and putting him down during my lunch break. I just try to be available throughout the day if my wife needs me.\n\nAnyways, on to the main point of this post. Last night my wife tells me she wants to keep the toddler home from daycare today. I told her that I didn't think it was a good idea. How was she going to feed and put the baby down for a nap while taking care of toddler? She already gets stressed and overwhelmed just looking after the baby. Why put herself through more stress? I told her that I could not take the day off of work and she would be alone taking care of both kids. She said she really wanted to spend time with both kids and felt like she doesn't see our toddler enough. Fine, no problem, if she wants to do this it is up to her, I reiterated that I would not be around to help.\n\nCut to this morning, I got up at midnight and 4 am to take care of the baby. I get both kids ready and made breakfast for everyone.\n\nI start work and sure enough, 20 minutes after I started, I hear my wife trying to tell our toddler that she just needs to go in the other room to put the baby down for a nap. Of course the toddler doesn't want to leave her side, toddler starts crying. I can hear my wife getting frustrated. Wife finally leaves to put baby down and comes back. She now has to juggle going back and forth trying to settle the baby by putting the pacifier back in (we are starting some sleep training) and the toddler who wants all of her attention.\n\nFinally baby gets settled, wife is obviously stressed and tired and it is 9:45am... She comes in to my office where I am working and asks did I not hear her struggling? Why did I not come and help.\n\nAITA for telling my wife I told you so, that I said I would not be around to help and this is what you get? That she should have let me bring our toddler to daycare?", "created_utc": 1678465653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nto2j/aita_for_not_helping_my_wife_with_the_kids_when/", "score": 674, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are both struggling parents of two very young children. And I do wonder if your wife maybe is struggling with PPD in addition to being a busy mother. But in this situation, I don't blame you for your actions. You had to work. Your wife was aware you had to work. She made the choice to keep the 2-year-old out of daycare. From my reading of this post, it doesn't sound like you're slacking on any parenting duties. Sounds like you are definitely contributing.\n\nIf you worked out of the home, she wouldn't have been able to rely on you for being around.

Drop the toddler off on your way there and pick them up at the end of the work day. If your wife wants to keep them home all day, that's on her, but I would arrange to go into the office those days because I think right now (and this is probably just due to sleep deprivation) she's treating you being home as available for daddy duty, rather than that you are \"at work\" from 9-5 and she should be keeping the older kiddo in daycare since you guys are fortunate to have that as an option.", "NTA. whether you are at home or in the office, you are WORKING.

This is 100% on me and that time I am the one who\u2018s supposed to do all the \u201ework\u201c related to our daughter.

And then, she doesn't even have to take care of two kids at once, and the one day she chooses to do so, she can't even make it 4 hours. \n\nTime for a sit down. She is on leave to care for the children, the toddler has day care so she doesn't get overwhelmed, she needs to come up with a system and stick to it, and it can't involve interrupting your work.

You can't be interrupted constantly just because you're home.", "NTA.... But there are ways to involve the older baby and incorporate/ enlist their help with the younger one. My first baby was super cooperative, and would not fuss if I had to leave her alone and go to the little one when he started crying. She is 1.5 years older than him, so not that much older than him. Maybe you guys will learn with more experience. All in all, it would help to have clearer communication if (after your workday), you guys could sit peacefully and strategize how things could be handled differently next time to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. For instance, one possible scenario could be that the older sis helps during baby's nap time by quietly being in the room, maybe stroking baby's hair till it fell asleep. That way she would feel she helped / contributed, and would be calm. Hope this helps.", "NTA. \nBut you might want to consider working in the office more if working from home is going to cause these issues.", "NTA.

On one hand, your wife is on maternity leave and struggling to find a balance.  I understand that.  But, on the other hand, you are the only one making a living at the moment to pay bills and put food on the table.  I have been in your shoes.  You, sir, do your best with the situation you are given.  You try to help out when you are free.  Good on you.  I don't see any good reason for her to attack you while you are working.  You did tell her it would be a bad idea when you are working, to put undue stress on herself.  It's good that you care for your wife.  I don't see any issue here.  Perhaps your wife might have post partum depression, which might explain the stress and frustration.  But, when you are on the clock, work comes first.  Risking your job would be a bad idea.", "Jesus NTA.  This is the same kind of logic a woman applies when she lets herself get pregnant to force the relationship into a marriage.\n\nYour wife is ignoring what you are saying and trying to get you to do what she wants and has envisioned.", "NAH your wife is suffering from mom guilt which a societal pressure to do everything all at once with a smile and high efficiency. It's ridiculous and unreasonable but still a valid emotion that you might understand as well. Instead of the complete logical approach of trying to prove your point, take into consideration that your youngest isn't even 5 months so hormones & stress are playing a part in this.\n\nTalk to your wife to see how to handle this as a team. Offer some empathy to see if she'll open up about *why* she wants to keep putting this pressure on herself. Remind her that she's the backbone of the house and if she's stressed/overwhelmed then things crumble. Give her space to take care of herself so she can be the best mom she wants to be. \n\nBut if you do the \"I told you so\" game it will cause resentment all around and everyone loses.", "NAH. It's not your fault or your wife's. Like most mothers wants her kids to be near her most of the time and she is not thinking this through. Maybe you're due for a long conversation including couples counseling", "ESH\n\nI would say NAH, but wife was accusing you of being a bad partner when you have other obligations that were well communicated. Emergency, yes, of course you would set in.  This was not an emergency. \n\nYou get a bit of heat for saying \"i told you so\".  99% (my real, made up number), is because of some sort of social validation/shaming game that moms put upon themselves.  Moms shit on other moms, and shit on themselves, when they use the tools at their disposal to make parenting less of a chore.  BTDT.  You get in your own head about what is \"the right way\" vs \"what actually works\".  It tends to be a series of failures of some sort of fucked up goal in your mind and then feel guilty because as a mom you can't manage it. \n\nI think your wife sincerely wanted to hang out with both of the children and reality sucked ass.  But i think your wife set herself up with unreasonable goals& high expectations. It is ok if children are crying & it is not a reflection on her as a parent. Having your kid in daycare 5 vs 4 days isn't some mommy failure (there is a lot of guilt & shame about sending a kid to daycare when you don't HAVE to, which is ridiculous). \n\nEveryone is learning their limits here.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like you have work, which is obviously a priority.  It also sounds like your wife might like to get comfortable with juggling both kids at once\n\n\nHere is something me and my husband learned early on.  Sometimes when I vent, I don't want him to tell me the easiest solution (in your case, keeping the toddler in preschool full day, 5 days a week).  Sometimes, I just want my husband to listen or even ask \"what can I do to help?\" Maybe you can't watch either child during the workday but maybe you can offer her some alone time after work. \n\nI remember it feeling really hard when I had an infant and a toddler. And as a mom, sometimes you worry what if the toddler is feeling pushed aside.", "NAH it\u2019s just a tough time and a lot pressure. Can you see why it would make her feel guilty to send the toddler away when she is at home and presumably able to care for them?  Worrying that they might feel replaced and really, a toddler is a baby - it\u2019s hard to be away from them! On top of that, There are people who can\u2019t afford daycare or somehow do manage to take care of multiple babies at once - and that\u2019s great for them - but knowing that can feel like pressure to be able to do the same. Like you are being a bad mom because you couldn\u2019t make it work. So I hear you on this being self inflicted, but try to acknowledge that it isn\u2019t just a logic-based decision. It\u2019s emotional too.", "Soft YTA for saying \u201cthis is what you get and I told you so.\u201d But you are correct. Your wife clearly needs help and it seems like she wants to keep them home instead of sending them to daycare. Have you thought about a mommy\u2019s helper/nanny that can help in the home instead of sending your toddler to daycare?", "Everyone and no one is an AH if they have a 5 month old. With the exception of a rare few 5 month old infants, they don't let anyone get any sleep. This leads to all sorts of communication breakdowns and strife between the parents. \n\nYour reasoning is completely sound. Your wife is a normal human. So, I'm going to guess that her level of exhaustion is preventing her from hearing your message and taking the kids to daycare, and I know based on what you wrote (the number of times you are up at night and the \"I told you so\"s) that your level of exhaustion is preventing you from communicating your message with any form of empathy.\n\nLong story short: you both need a break. Get a grandparent or hire someone for a 24 hr period so that you can both get some uninterrupted sleep. Then, if and only if you've both had 6+ hrs of uninterrupted sleep, readdress the childcare issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe occasionally pick them up earlier or let them stay home but not when she\u2019s already complaining about how tired she is that doesn\u2019t make any sense and doesn\u2019t do anybody any favors.

Especially since you\u2019re doing work overnight. \n\nMaybe separation anxiety of daycare for toddler is doing more harm than good, and that lack of attention in addition to a new baby is causing more tantrums than normal?? \n\nI\u2019ve heard often that babies and toddlers don\u2019t like being independent until you start to smother them. I think it\u2019s concerning that toddler is so upset about being left for even 10-15 minutes to put the baby asleep that it turns into a tantrum. Also why are you doing sleep training during the day? Baby is awake they should be stimulated or left to have time to roam the entire two feet they can move until they\u2019re tired enough to be peacefully put down for nap time again, no? Is there an effort to establish a sleep cycle here so that baby goes to sleep at the same time every night so you\u2019re trying to force naps?? 4AM wake time for you means baby was put down for nap at what, 6AM? Realistically baby should be sleeping 1-2 hours every nap, and feeding should be relatively easy. I have friends with babies who at that age were very easy to take care of during the day simply because of how often they slept. We could go over for a party for the day and babies were content and happy. Only once they started hitting one and two did they become really high energy and in need of constant stimulation and attention. 5-8 months is kind of the \u201cbaby is easy sweet spot\u201d \n\nI know some babies are definitely more difficult than others but daytime naps should be given according to cues for baby tiredness and hunger, not necessarily set to an explicit schedule as the growth rate and wake hours change so fast that one schedule isn\u2019t going to work for a long time.\n\nI guess all of the decision making here doesn\u2019t make sense to me. It seems like things are being forced because that\u2019s what your wife *thinks* should be done but she\u2019s walking upstream and the natural course of running water is pulling her down when she should be floating along with it.\n\nMaybe have her try teaching toddler some quiet activities to do alongside her while baby is sleeping that she also enjoys. For example when I was 2-3 my mom, who also had my baby sister, and baby brother (1997, 1998, 2000 spread) would give me some markers, lay down on the floor next to me, and draw while teaching me too. She enjoyed it, as did I. So it was relaxing for both of us. \n\nToddler can also \u201chelp\u201d out with tasks like \u201ccleaning\u201d. Give toddler a toy broom and have her follow you around. Give her doll clothes to fold laundry next to you. Put her on the counter when you cook. Toddlers are so exceedingly bright and will absorb everything like a sponge if given the right attention. And given the tantrum over being left for 10 minutes, that\u2019s honestly all she really wants.\n\nYou could also let toddler into the bedroom while putting baby to sleep but with the instructions that she has to stay super quiet. Idk why toddler has to stay outside for that.", "NAH, bc while I think your wife was *wrong* here, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s and asshole.

Throw in that it's apparently a 20 minute journey to get back from nursery and you're talking having your oldest child around for maybe 90 minutes to an hour of awake time per day. \n\nIt might work great from a financial perspective but your wife isn't wrong, it won't be great for your two year old. And a two year old with a five month old brother is already feeling himself misplaced in mommy's affections. If he's not acting up because of that already he will. In fact it very likely is a marker in why he's velcroing to your wife so much she's frustrated.\n\n\"I told you this would go badly\" is not helpful in any way. Are you right? Sure.

If you\u2019re paying for childcare outside of the home then that child needs to be where the money is going otherwise you\u2019re wasting money. \n\nI understand her missing her child and wanting to spend time with both children but there\u2019s weekends for that. Especially with a 5 month old you need as much time to sit back as possible and if your trying to manage a toddler who should be at daycare and a 5 month old you knew what you signed up for when you did it. \n\nWould it be nice to get a little help\u2026 hell yes.. but if she\u2019s on maternity leave and you\u2019re the only one working right now then that\u2019s where your focus should be unless you have time to stop and help.", "NTA but also - is this unusual for your wife? Is she doing okay? I remember at the height of my postpartum anxiety feeling like I needed both my kids to be near me at all times but also simultaneously being much more easily frustrated.", "Doesnt matter what we say mate. If you're wife thinks you're the asshole, you're the asshole.", "NTA", "And this is one of the biggest drawbacks to wfh.  You are physically there, and partners are not yet mentally in the place where you simply being present in the home does NOT mean you can drop everything and help them out or do the household chores or go out to lunch.  It seems like this becomes even more of a problem when you introduce newborns because the learning curve in caring for babies is steep and all your on-maternity-leave partner sees is that they are exhausted and you did nothing to help.  You are NTA, but need to have an open conversation with your partner about expectations.", "NTA, but \"see, I told you\" isn't constructive. \n\nHave a grown up conversation, set boundaries and expectations, and dont waver once you set them", "NTA your wife sounds like a nightmare. She wants best of both worlds and it doesn\u2019t exist. You\u2019re either at work or your not. And if you aren\u2019t then y\u2019all are homeless. I\u2019d just go to the office every day. Then she\u2019ll appreciate how much you do help when/if you went back to working from home.", "I wonder if she\u2019s going through some kind of post partum depression?

I\u2019d look into going back into the office if i were you", "NTA , you do more than your fair share, you will end up burnt out! You need to sit down and talk to her because kids pick up.on the stress! Babies cry and your wife stressing out is only making the situation more than what it should be!", "What is it with your wife that she can't take care of two kids? If she's struggling, has she been to her OB and checked for hormone imbalances, PPD, etc? If not, she needs to go immediately. It's not normal to be so stressed taking care of a toddler and a 5 month old.\n\nNAH, but your wife is teetering on the edge of being TA. If she doesn't get help, she's over the edge.", "NTA you need to work.  Your wife needs some help to figure things out. Not from you from someone who can give her advice.  It\u2019s tough with a baby and a toddler but it doesn\u2019t have to be so stressful. I feel so sorry that she\u2019s that overwhelmed.", "NTA", "NTA - Your wife needs to recognize her limitations", "NTA clearly. You're the member of this current family that is paying for everything along daycare. The simplistic fact of your wife not able to handling 2 children is an little bit baffling. She needs to have a system in place. She chose the responsibility of having multiple children back-to-back with you. You're accomplishing your role well. She (your beloved wife) has to \"grow up\" and find a way to deal with this minor consequence. \"I told so\" is a little mean BUT you did warn her and suggested to let your toddler be at daycare. She should not complain at her own misguidance and misjudgement. Keep doing your role for the foreseeable future.", "NTA. Go back to the office.", "NTA\nWife, meet FAFO", "Yes YTA. You are their father. Or ESH.", "YTA.  But for only one reason.  It is just not cool to pick that moment to tell your wife, I told you so, This is what you get, and You should have let me bring our toddler to daycare.", "NTA. Are you just supposed to lose your job because you keep doing other things while you are supposed to be working? Your wife is overwhelmed, that\u2019s understandable. So are you. You do all the night shift with the baby, that\u2019s huge. It should be 50/50. Maybe your wife has ppd, maybe she doesn\u2019t. It should be brought up at the next doctor appointment just to be safe. However, you should start going into the office everyday so you can\u2019t be disturbed for non emergency reasons. Call on your lunch to check in.", "NAH. Your wife is probably miserable and racked with guilt over feeling like she\u2019s neglecting your toddler for the baby. Maybe you could chat through that with her and try to reassure her, rather than focus on the logistics.", "I have to ask. Has she seen the doctor for Post Partum depression? I behaved a LOT like this myself and when they tested me I needed medication to help balance me. Post Partum can last months and longer, and even if they don't start with it, they can get it later on.", "Sounds like your wife could use some counseling. Maybe she has PPD. You are doing most of the work by the sound of it. I loved taking my so to daycare. Help me get college studying done", "NTA. \n\nYour wife needs to understand that that just spending time with kids is not enough if she\u2019s stressed. It\u2019s about spending quality time, not quantity. \n\nMaybe try working from a cafe or other outside place to help reinforce the time boundary between work and home. Might help your wife understand your point better.", "OP may need to go back into the office. Wife neither understands nor respects work time.\nNot a peaceful environment to work in coupled wife the wife coming in complaining or asking for help.", "I think this may well be true. I had PPD with my first and had that feeling of overwhelm all the time, honestly now with 3 under 5 feels easier because I'm mentally healthy, OP, please make sure your wife talks to someone about PPD, you are NTA and sound like a lovely supportive husband and father but I don't think your wife is an asshole, I think she needs help.", "She's going to drive OP to go in to the office when they doesn't have to just to get some work done.\n\nI wonder if maybe wife should see a therapist.  She sounds really overwhelmed emotionally.", "I think I told you so is a frustration that she doesn\u2019t listen to and disregards his input and then it DOES impact his work and his day as she goes and complains and asks for help. \n\nHad he just said, I told you in a situation where he wasn\u2019t impacted he\u2019d be more of a TA but when he tells her not to do something because it will affect his work and she still steamrolls him, well maybe listen to his input next time.", "Also, coming in and saving her enables her further to do it again and doesn\u2019t change the behaviour. \nYou had a conversation, you said you were working and couldn\u2019t help and it wasn\u2019t a bad idea and she didn\u2019t listen. She does not have the right to complain and demand help then. If she gets it she\u2019ll do it again and again and it never ends.", "OPs wife shouldn't even be sleep deprived, because OP does all night feedings/wakeups, and then lets his wife sleep in while he prepares breakfast and gets toddler ready.", "Soooooo you want to turn the 2 year old into another parent?", "It days she wanted to spend more time with the toddler", "What exactly makes you think PPD is an issue here? She had a baby recently so I guess that makes it possible, but I don\u2019t see anything in the post otherwise that would hint at PPD.", "Who happens to be working at the time, ergo unavailable for helping with the kids. The same situation would have happened had OP been in the office and equally unavailable. Work from home is still work after all, not kid time.", "His in work", "He is working. He cant just run off.", "He\u2019s also the breadwinner and sole income earner.\n\nWonder how stressed wife would be if hubby lost her job bc she was demanding unnecessary things from him?", "OP :  I can't help I need to work\n\nWife:  that's fine I can do it.\n\nOP:   just remember, I cannot help.\n\nWife:  ya ok, I heard u, I got it.\n\n2 hours later\n\nWife: why aren't you helping me\n\nOp: ???\n\nWhat does he say there?  Only thing I can come up with is \"I told u I can't, I'm working\".\n\nYour response:  op is an asshole for saying he told her so.  \n\nLol, you are completely clueless.", "It really sounds like PPD. The overwhelm, the tears, the frustration and the missing the older kid and feeling guilt about preschool are textbook PPD.", "In my experience, people think if mom is home, kids should be, too.", "More like pulling his weight more than he should. He works, she's on maternity leave but he gets up and does the night feeds? And helps during his workday? And the mom barely made it 2 hours with both kids? I'm side eyeing mom here....", "Sounds like she's both overwhelmed and feeling guilty about it - like maybe she thinks she shouldn't be struggling this much just with 2 kids and feels like she's not being a good mom. When the reality is that babies and toddlers are a nightmare to take care of for anyone.", "It sounds like both were necessary. The \"I told you I wouldn't be able to help\" as a reminder that he is at work at not at her beck and call.  The \"I told you that you wouldn't be able to handle it\" as a reality check and, hopefully, a way to motivate his wife to make proactive changes to her routine.  Juggling two kids is hard and parents have to find what works. My children were 13 months apart and, when they were both babies and toddlers, my husband frequently traveled for work  I spent days at a time functioning as a single parent. \nIt was hard but I did eventually  find what worked Assuming her husband will be able to skip work to help her out isn't what works.", "Its possible shes still sleep deprived, we don't know what happened on previous nights, and maybe she was woken up by the baby too.", "Involving the kid in her baby care so he doesn't feel neglected isn't parentifying the kid.", "LMAO you're kidding, right?\n\nAbsolutely nothing about that comment leads a reasonable person to the assumption you just made.\n\nEnlisting a toddler to help with very small tasks for a new sibling (hand you diapers or wipes when changing, sit with you when feeding, gently pat their back to help burp, give pacifiers, etc.) is a great way to help them build self confidence, takes the edge off the natural jealousy that comes with no longer being the \"baby\", lets them feel involved and is one of the first building blocks to helping them develop a healthy  and loving attitude toward their new sibling.", "Toddlers LOVE being involved with everyday tasks. They\u2019re very curious about the world around them and how things work. Making things like \u201ccan you find the wipes for mommy?\u201d into a silly game for a toddler is both fun for them and helpful for mom. It\u2019s literally how you get through parenting multiple young kiddos, and it\u2019s a great way to teach empathy and build motor skills.", "So I\u2019m confused, she wants to spend more time with the toddler but also *doesn\u2019t* want to spend the day with the toddler?", "Look, you\u2019re two parents and you have a say too. If she can\u2019t manage on her own and it affects you and your work you have the right to make changes. She\u2019s not the sole dictator in the household. \n\nWith a nanny for example she would see the 2 year old more during the day while having a pair of extra hands. She\u2019d need to worry less as well because she\u2019d see the other person a lot so that she knows what the interaction is like. \n\nHonestly, you shouldn\u2019t have to look after the kids at night if you\u2019re working. If you were both working I\u2019d say take turns but right now her job is literally to take care of the kids and she does have help and resources she chooses not to use. \n\nYou need a sit down with her and she may also need therapy as others have pointed out.", "Yes and she is doing unpaid care work. Bohoo for the husband. Children mean work even-though you have to earn money.", "\ud83d\udcafagree. And questioning herself why she can\u2019t handle it. Guilt is awful. And probably has friends whispering in her ear about why she leaves the other in childcare so long. I feel for her. But work from home is still work and you have arranged childcare. And you also aren\u2019t adding commute time (being away from home). You are NTA.", "Yes. Guilt. She's guilty she can't give her toddler all the time she used to. Guilty the baby spends more time with her during the day than the toddler does. Guilty she'll go back to work and \"miss\" this time she was expecting to treasure. Guilty she isn't perfect at being mom of 2. Guilty she's stressed about the toddler when she wants to focus on the baby. Guilty she put her kid in daycare when \"there's no reason\" because she's home.\n\nIt's not healthy and it's not right but it's it's same kind of guilt most noma end up feeling. It's guilt. And dads aren't entirely free of the curse but I don't think they typically get it quite the same as moms... so it makes sense thatOP is baffled.", "Well she needs to get over it and quick bc she isn't doing anyone any favors here....", "My sister's daycare provider tries to heap that mom guilt onto my sister and my sister refuses to play that game. Sister is a county employee who gets all of the federal holidays off and sends her child to a home daycare provider. The provider will ask her if she's planning to bring her son to daycare on holidays she knows the county offices are closed for, pretty clearly implying that she thinks she should be keeping him home if she's not at work. My sister is like \"Yeah, I'm paying for that day either way, and I have things to do around the house/TV to watch without a toddler interrupting/errands to run/etc.\" My sister knows she's right but I've also reassured her that it's totally cool that her kid is at daycare while she enjoys her day off.", "I really hate to agree,but I do.", "Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s not like she grew them with her literal body and it takes over a year to actually recover from the physical changes and nutrient loss\u2026she does days why wouldn\u2019t he do nights?

Bet she wouldn't have a problem leaving the 2 yo at daycare til he got off then...", "Because in AITA laws mothers aren\u2019t allowed to do bad things they can only have PPD"]}
