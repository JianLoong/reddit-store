{"id": 11961, "submission_id": "11nto2j", "title": "AITA for not helping my wife with the kids when she wanted to keep them home from daycare and I have to work?", "selftext": "So my wife and I have two kids. One who is a bit over 2 years old and another that is 5 months old. I work Monday to Friday 9-5 from home, occasionally go in to the office. My wife is on maternity leave and taking care of the 5 month old. I take care of the baby for over night wakings and feedings.\n\nThe 2 year old is in daycare. Whether I send my kid to daycare 1 day or 5 days a week for 1 hour or 8 it costs the same. My wife likes to pick up our toddler from daycare around 3:15 everyday instead of letting me go when I finish work because she doesn't want our kid to be there so much during the day. The problem is I am left watching the baby for the 45 minutes while she is gone and then for the hour that she is taking care of both of them she gets overwhelmed, stressed, very annoyed at me and our kids, it's just not great overall.\n\nEvery day my wife tells me that she is exhausted, she has no time to herself she doesn't get things done that she needs to, she's overwhelmed, just wants to relax when the baby naps etc... I try to help out with the baby during the day when I can, like feeding and putting him down during my lunch break. I just try to be available throughout the day if my wife needs me.\n\nAnyways, on to the main point of this post. Last night my wife tells me she wants to keep the toddler home from daycare today. I told her that I didn't think it was a good idea. How was she going to feed and put the baby down for a nap while taking care of toddler? She already gets stressed and overwhelmed just looking after the baby. Why put herself through more stress? I told her that I could not take the day off of work and she would be alone taking care of both kids. She said she really wanted to spend time with both kids and felt like she doesn't see our toddler enough. Fine, no problem, if she wants to do this it is up to her, I reiterated that I would not be around to help.\n\nCut to this morning, I got up at midnight and 4 am to take care of the baby. I get both kids ready and made breakfast for everyone.\n\nI start work and sure enough, 20 minutes after I started, I hear my wife trying to tell our toddler that she just needs to go in the other room to put the baby down for a nap. Of course the toddler doesn't want to leave her side, toddler starts crying. I can hear my wife getting frustrated. Wife finally leaves to put baby down and comes back. She now has to juggle going back and forth trying to settle the baby by putting the pacifier back in (we are starting some sleep training) and the toddler who wants all of her attention.\n\nFinally baby gets settled, wife is obviously stressed and tired and it is 9:45am... She comes in to my office where I am working and asks did I not hear her struggling? Why did I not come and help.\n\nAITA for telling my wife I told you so, that I said I would not be around to help and this is what you get? That she should have let me bring our toddler to daycare?", "created_utc": 1678465653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nto2j/aita_for_not_helping_my_wife_with_the_kids_when/", "score": 1751, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are both struggling parents of two very young children. And I do wonder if your wife maybe is struggling with PPD in addition to being a busy mother. But in this situation, I don't blame you for your actions. You had to work. Your wife was aware you had to work. She made the choice to keep the 2-year-old out of daycare. From my reading of this post, it doesn't sound like you're slacking on any parenting duties. Sounds like you are definitely contributing.\n\nIf you worked out of the home, she wouldn't have been able to rely on you for being around. And you told her that you wouldn't be.\n\nBut I do think you both need to treat each other with grace, and maybe consider couple's counseling.

Drop the toddler off on your way there and pick them up at the end of the work day. If your wife wants to keep them home all day, that's on her, but I would arrange to go into the office those days because I think right now (and this is probably just due to sleep deprivation) she's treating you being home as available for daddy duty, rather than that you are \"at work\" from 9-5 and she should be keeping the older kiddo in daycare since you guys are fortunate to have that as an option.", "NTA. whether you are at home or in the office, you are WORKING. And your focus should be on work. A lot of companies even have policies in place that if you WFH you must have reliable child care.

This is 100% on me and that time I am the one who\u2018s supposed to do all the \u201ework\u201c related to our daughter.

And then, she doesn't even have to take care of two kids at once, and the one day she chooses to do so, she can't even make it 4 hours. \n\nTime for a sit down. She is on leave to care for the children, the toddler has day care so she doesn't get overwhelmed, she needs to come up with a system and stick to it, and it can't involve interrupting your work. Your work is the current thing keeping a roof over your head and providing for the family, and there's no reason you should stop work to help with problems' she is creating herself. \n\nI can't find much sympathy for her at all, my mom raised me and my sister who were two years apart, and she often took care of my cousins as well.

You can't be interrupted constantly just because you're home.", "NTA.... But there are ways to involve the older baby and incorporate/ enlist their help with the younger one. My first baby was super cooperative, and would not fuss if I had to leave her alone and go to the little one when he started crying. She is 1.5 years older than him, so not that much older than him. Maybe you guys will learn with more experience. All in all, it would help to have clearer communication if (after your workday), you guys could sit peacefully and strategize how things could be handled differently next time to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. For instance, one possible scenario could be that the older sis helps during baby's nap time by quietly being in the room, maybe stroking baby's hair till it fell asleep. That way she would feel she helped / contributed, and would be calm. Hope this helps.", "NTA. \nBut you might want to consider working in the office more if working from home is going to cause these issues.", "NTA.

I'm sure she knew it. as for you being home, you're working. it is a new normal for a lot of people but to do it professionally you need to act as if you were in the office not available as if it's a saturday and you're just watching football", "Neither you nor your wife are the bad guys here.  On one hand, your wife is on maternity leave and struggling to find a balance.  I understand that.  But, on the other hand, you are the only one making a living at the moment to pay bills and put food on the table.  I have been in your shoes.  You, sir, do your best with the situation you are given.  You try to help out when you are free.  Good on you.  I don't see any good reason for her to attack you while you are working.  You did tell her it would be a bad idea when you are working, to put undue stress on herself.  It's good that you care for your wife.  I don't see any issue here.  Perhaps your wife might have post partum depression, which might explain the stress and frustration.  But, when you are on the clock, work comes first.  Risking your job would be a bad idea.", "Jesus NTA.  This is the same kind of logic a woman applies when she lets herself get pregnant to force the relationship into a marriage.\n\nYour wife is ignoring what you are saying and trying to get you to do what she wants and has envisioned.", "NAH your wife is suffering from mom guilt which a societal pressure to do everything all at once with a smile and high efficiency. It's ridiculous and unreasonable but still a valid emotion that you might understand as well. Instead of the complete logical approach of trying to prove your point, take into consideration that your youngest isn't even 5 months so hormones & stress are playing a part in this.\n\nTalk to your wife to see how to handle this as a team. Offer some empathy to see if she'll open up about *why* she wants to keep putting this pressure on herself. Remind her that she's the backbone of the house and if she's stressed/overwhelmed then things crumble. Give her space to take care of herself so she can be the best mom she wants to be. \n\nBut if you do the \"I told you so\" game it will cause resentment all around and everyone loses.", "NAH. It's not your fault or your wife's. Like most mothers wants her kids to be near her most of the time and she is not thinking this through. Maybe you're due for a long conversation including couples counseling", "ESH\n\nI would say NAH, but wife was accusing you of being a bad partner when you have other obligations that were well communicated. Emergency, yes, of course you would set in.  This was not an emergency. \n\nYou get a bit of heat for saying \"i told you so\".  99% (my real, made up number), is because of some sort of social validation/shaming game that moms put upon themselves.  Moms shit on other moms, and shit on themselves, when they use the tools at their disposal to make parenting less of a chore.  BTDT.  You get in your own head about what is \"the right way\" vs \"what actually works\".  It tends to be a series of failures of some sort of fucked up goal in your mind and then feel guilty because as a mom you can't manage it. \n\nI think your wife sincerely wanted to hang out with both of the children and reality sucked ass.  But i think your wife set herself up with unreasonable goals& high expectations. It is ok if children are crying & it is not a reflection on her as a parent. Having your kid in daycare 5 vs 4 days isn't some mommy failure (there is a lot of guilt & shame about sending a kid to daycare when you don't HAVE to, which is ridiculous). \n\nEveryone is learning their limits here.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like you have work, which is obviously a priority.  It also sounds like your wife might like to get comfortable with juggling both kids at once\n\n\nHere is something me and my husband learned early on.  Sometimes when I vent, I don't want him to tell me the easiest solution (in your case, keeping the toddler in preschool full day, 5 days a week).  Sometimes, I just want my husband to listen or even ask \"what can I do to help?\" Maybe you can't watch either child during the workday but maybe you can offer her some alone time after work. \n\nI remember it feeling really hard when I had an infant and a toddler. And as a mom, sometimes you worry what if the toddler is feeling pushed aside.", "NAH it\u2019s just a tough time and a lot pressure. Can you see why it would make her feel guilty to send the toddler away when she is at home and presumably able to care for them?  Worrying that they might feel replaced and really, a toddler is a baby - it\u2019s hard to be away from them! On top of that, There are people who can\u2019t afford daycare or somehow do manage to take care of multiple babies at once - and that\u2019s great for them - but knowing that can feel like pressure to be able to do the same. Like you are being a bad mom because you couldn\u2019t make it work. So I hear you on this being self inflicted, but try to acknowledge that it isn\u2019t just a logic-based decision. It\u2019s emotional too.", "Soft YTA for saying \u201cthis is what you get and I told you so.\u201d But you are correct. Your wife clearly needs help and it seems like she wants to keep them home instead of sending them to daycare. Have you thought about a mommy\u2019s helper/nanny that can help in the home instead of sending your toddler to daycare?", "Everyone and no one is an AH if they have a 5 month old. With the exception of a rare few 5 month old infants, they don't let anyone get any sleep. This leads to all sorts of communication breakdowns and strife between the parents. \n\nYour reasoning is completely sound. Your wife is a normal human. So, I'm going to guess that her level of exhaustion is preventing her from hearing your message and taking the kids to daycare, and I know based on what you wrote (the number of times you are up at night and the \"I told you so\"s) that your level of exhaustion is preventing you from communicating your message with any form of empathy.\n\nLong story short: you both need a break. Get a grandparent or hire someone for a 24 hr period so that you can both get some uninterrupted sleep. Then, if and only if you've both had 6+ hrs of uninterrupted sleep, readdress the childcare issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe occasionally pick them up earlier or let them stay home but not when she\u2019s already complaining about how tired she is that doesn\u2019t make any sense and doesn\u2019t do anybody any favors.

Especially since you\u2019re doing work overnight. \n\nMaybe separation anxiety of daycare for toddler is doing more harm than good, and that lack of attention in addition to a new baby is causing more tantrums than normal?? \n\nI\u2019ve heard often that babies and toddlers don\u2019t like being independent until you start to smother them. I think it\u2019s concerning that toddler is so upset about being left for even 10-15 minutes to put the baby asleep that it turns into a tantrum. Also why are you doing sleep training during the day? Baby is awake they should be stimulated or left to have time to roam the entire two feet they can move until they\u2019re tired enough to be peacefully put down for nap time again, no? Is there an effort to establish a sleep cycle here so that baby goes to sleep at the same time every night so you\u2019re trying to force naps?? 4AM wake time for you means baby was put down for nap at what, 6AM? Realistically baby should be sleeping 1-2 hours every nap, and feeding should be relatively easy. I have friends with babies who at that age were very easy to take care of during the day simply because of how often they slept. We could go over for a party for the day and babies were content and happy. Only once they started hitting one and two did they become really high energy and in need of constant stimulation and attention. 5-8 months is kind of the \u201cbaby is easy sweet spot\u201d \n\nI know some babies are definitely more difficult than others but daytime naps should be given according to cues for baby tiredness and hunger, not necessarily set to an explicit schedule as the growth rate and wake hours change so fast that one schedule isn\u2019t going to work for a long time.\n\nI guess all of the decision making here doesn\u2019t make sense to me. It seems like things are being forced because that\u2019s what your wife *thinks* should be done but she\u2019s walking upstream and the natural course of running water is pulling her down when she should be floating along with it.\n\nMaybe have her try teaching toddler some quiet activities to do alongside her while baby is sleeping that she also enjoys. For example when I was 2-3 my mom, who also had my baby sister, and baby brother (1997, 1998, 2000 spread) would give me some markers, lay down on the floor next to me, and draw while teaching me too. She enjoyed it, as did I. So it was relaxing for both of us. \n\nToddler can also \u201chelp\u201d out with tasks like \u201ccleaning\u201d. Give toddler a toy broom and have her follow you around. Give her doll clothes to fold laundry next to you. Put her on the counter when you cook. Toddlers are so exceedingly bright and will absorb everything like a sponge if given the right attention. And given the tantrum over being left for 10 minutes, that\u2019s honestly all she really wants.\n\nYou could also let toddler into the bedroom while putting baby to sleep but with the instructions that she has to stay super quiet. Idk why toddler has to stay outside for that.", "NAH, bc while I think your wife was *wrong* here, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s and asshole.

Throw in that it's apparently a 20 minute journey to get back from nursery and you're talking having your oldest child around for maybe 90 minutes to an hour of awake time per day. \n\nIt might work great from a financial perspective but your wife isn't wrong, it won't be great for your two year old. And a two year old with a five month old brother is already feeling himself misplaced in mommy's affections. If he's not acting up because of that already he will. In fact it very likely is a marker in why he's velcroing to your wife so much she's frustrated.\n\n\"I told you this would go badly\" is not helpful in any way. Are you right? Sure.
