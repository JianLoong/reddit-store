{"id": 141, "submission_id": "yiwxpv", "title": "AITA for refusing to sit with my partner?", "selftext": "throwaway, etc.\n\nI live with two roommates and my partner, Fred. We have been having a fair amount of on and off tension with one of the roommates, Amy. Amy, who I do care about a lot, has a long trauma history and can be very combative and argumentative when she's feeling defensive. Honestly a generally argumentative person. Fred and Amy have been in the majority of the conflict-- while they share a lot of common interests and views, they bring out the worst in each other and there's been a lot of discontent that they've worked to resolve and set aside.\n\nOn to tonight: Amy, Fred and I were headed out to an event and were planning to meet our other roommate there. On the way, Fred and Amy get into an argument about how rent is paid (we all venmo Fred and then he pays our landlord. He is asking for the venmo to be sent a few days prior to the 1st of the month so he can send rent on time. Amy is resistant to this and doesn't want to elaborate further.)\n\nI could give you a play by play of the exact argument, but I think it's safe to say neither handled it well and it escalated quickly to yelling and vitriol. I have tried very hard to stay out of their conflict but obviously stuck in the car while they're screaming is a different story. I asked them both to be quiet and essentially said: I can see there's a miscommunication, it's not appropriate or productive to keep yelling mean things so knock it off. They were both eventually able to stop and don't speak for the rest of the ride.\n\nHe drops us off and parks the car. They don't speak in line but both speak with me normally. When we're settled, he says he doesn't want to sit by Amy and goes off to sit by himself, indicating I should go with him.\n\nHere's where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole: I had set up the blanket and we were expecting our friends. I felt like it was an escalation to take a stand and go sit alone with Fred rather than for Amy and Fred to continue to keep distance and resolve at a later time. While it was super clear that Amy started the original rent issue by refusing to communicate, neither handled it well and I was upset with both of them.\n\nI went off to call a friend and vent. Fred came up to me and insisted I go sit with him or he was going to leave and take the car with him, leaving Amy and I to find our own way home. He said he wouldn't tolerate being treated like this (a common feeling he has about Amy) and needed me to take a stand with him. I felt like he was putting me between a rock and a hard place. I told him explicitly, repeatedly, that I agreed with him, side with him, know it's wrong, and just don't agree with his actions handling it after the fact. I think he felt betrayed and like I wasn't taking his side.\n\nI was able to convince him to leave me the car because I felt that was kind of rude, and he went home on his own. Now he isn't speaking to me and is extremely upset-- more than usual, and I'm wondering if I read the whole situation wrong.

A lot of people get paid the last day of the month or the first day of the month and most rental agreements require payment by the 3rd. If she pays Fred on the 1st then he has 2 days to figure out how to pay the rent, that should be more than sufficient. If the issue is the 1-3 business day wait on Venmo tell Amy to pay in cash.
