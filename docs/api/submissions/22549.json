If he gets mad at you for confronting him about it, it would be him that's hurting the relationship, but something tells me that's not what's going to happen anyway. He probably doesn't know his fiance is being really aggressive in the messages. NTA", "NTA\n\nThe boyfriend should have at least left your friend alone after she said no.\n\nBut got did he get their numbers? Shared groups where he could see the numbers?\n\nI find it weird to go through one people's contacts to advertise for anything. He could have send you an advertisement with his details asking whether you would share it and be okay with a no or yes. Seems a bit creepy the way he DM'd strangers.", "Unsolicited selling to strangers on social media is icky, and particularly slimy when he\u2019s invoking your name in a bid to legitimise it.\n\nNTA.

He's gotta find out sometime.", "I just feel like he should know that's not appropriate before he does it to more of my friends because my friend was very confused. I don't want more of my friends reaching out to me for answers because that wastes MY time.", "The art looked mid. Not bad by any means but not $40 for a profile pic good. You're probably right though that I let it go unless it happens again, especially considering this attempt flopped so hard for him.", "I have no way to contact him directly. I'm not friends with the art account and he doesn't have any other socials. I could try to friend the art account but it would just be much easier to let my cousin know.", "Ugh I hate wording stories with a couple of the same sex. They're both men and his partner is the artist trying to sell his own art, not that it matters though. I've never even heard of an artist DMing people to sell art.", "NTA and I guarantee you his boyfriend does not know! Would you want your partner guilt tripping your friends and your friends' friends into buying overpriced art? Tell him!", "I keep rewording the post because I see how it's confusing, we graduated highschool recently I just haven't hung out with them since high school so that's why I said \"friend from high school.\"\n\nIn my mind her saying she's unemployed and him continuing to convince her is when it became unacceptable, he's basically telling her to go broke for his stupid art.", "Another option is making your account more private or limited access. Unfriend/block cousin and fiance so they can't see your friend list.", "No idea why you wouldn't try with him directly first, do you not have his number? Even if not it won't be that hard to find the art account just ask the friend that DM\u2019ed you to give you the account name?

Also I don't know how many people he has done this to, my highschool friend might just have been the first to let me know.\n\nBut anyway, I ended up just deciding make an announcement on my discord with all my closest friends to ignore him if he reaches out. Pretty much all of my friends are there including the one I mentioned in this post so at least now they're aware and it was a vague post so hopefully my cousin who is also in the server doesn't take it personally.", "Uuh...\nThis isn't how commissions work...\n\nNTA", "NTA.

And nicer terms count, BTW.\n\nI agree with others saying you should talk to your cousin, but I think, if possible, you should do it in person.

Over the phone would be better than texting, but your facial expressions would also add to the seriousness.", "As an artist, begging (in this case, *harassing* ) others to commission you is 100% cringy af.

Send a message to everyone on that to ignore those requests", "This is failed marketing and poor sales strategy. I'd advise to \" encourage a different tactic\" because he could potentially get his account suspended etc and people are dm you about it. Just words of encouragement or fyi to give so I don't see it hurting the relationship in any way.

In the art community it is highly frowned upon to dm people asking to buy commissions. You let them come to you, advertise your pieces etc. Never dm random people. In fact the only people I\u2019ve seen who do it are scammers trying to get people to buy their \u2018art\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s very unprofessional of him and especially dragging you into it. If his work is good people should be coming to him, not the other way round.", "NTA, and you should talk to your cousin about it. However, you should try for less inflammatory language; you called this guy creepy in your post, and that's not what most people understand with that word. Tell your cousin you understand his fiance wants to sell his art, but that you aren't comfortable with him contacting your friends or using your name.", "There is nothing wrong with you contacting your cousin over this. You are not obligated to speak with the fianc\u00e9 directly. Especially since you don\u2019t even know this guy or are in contact with him.", "NTA. I was a freelance artist for 10 years and I took commissions from time to time. I'd advertise it on my art page or Twitter or something then that would be it. It's really inappropriate for him to DM people, especially complete strangers. It's even more inappropriate for him to not drop the issue once someone said no. I'd definitely tell your cousin and ask him to talk to his BF about stopping contact with your friends list", "NTA. He needs to know that he's making a mistake.i see in other responses that you all recently graduated high school. I'm assuming he's like 19 or 20. Dude may actually be completely unaware that this is an appropriate way to advertise his art. It's best that someone points it out sooner rather than later. Please tell your cousin to slow down and that there is no rush to get married so young.", "NTA because they use your name to show how they got to their profile. It also comes of as a scam for them to dm people for sales instead of a buyer reaching out to the seller", "NTA but I'm curious about what he does? \"40$ for a profile pic\" what does that mean? Does he photograph you, edit it or like paint a picture?", "Tell your cousin that anyone spamming your friends is persona non grata.  Tell the spammer to knock it off or there will be hell to pay.  NTA.", "NTA. But also maybe block him so he can\u2019t contact your socials and contacts through socials? Could be an easy solution to avoid putting the responsibility of this man\u2019s actions on your cousin, and rather just explain yeah I had to block your fianc\u00e9 bc he was contacting my friends and being pushy about art commissions.", "Please get proof first!\nAsk that friend to send you screenshots so you know who it was,or atleast have some clues.\n\nLast thing you want to do is start drama over \"unverified information\" or accuse the wrong person.", "NTA  \n\n\nDude can go on HoFundMe if he needs money.", "Tell him.

Your cousin may not know.  The important thing to keep the peace with your cousin is to remain calm. Don't confront,  don't yell, and don't insult their fianc\u00e9.   Just provide the simple polite request.\n\nThen tell your friends that you've tried asking them to stop, but if they don't, they don't need to worry about offending you if they tell him to buzz off.\n\nThis lets your friends know that you're not endorsing him or his behavior,  so there is less drama on that front.
