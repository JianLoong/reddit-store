You could gently tell him that cold-messaging people and trying to pressure strangers into commissioning art is not going to win him clients, and may cause him to gain a reputation for being pushy and rude.\n\nHe needs to sign up to websites like Fivver, get his own website where he can showcase his work, and search various other websites that host creative job commissions. There are some forums on FB that he can join for artists that are open for commissions, but cold-approaching people for work they don't want or need isn't going to help him build his business, and could result in him getting bad public reviews or comments.\n\nBut only tell him if you want to. Phrase it like you're doing him a favor, helping him out with career advice rather than criticising or calling him out for being rude, it may help avoid making it all drama-drama.", "NTA lmao", "NTA\n\nHe is spamming your friends and using your name to sell his art.

If he gets mad at you for confronting him about it, it would be him that's hurting the relationship, but something tells me that's not what's going to happen anyway. He probably doesn't know his fiance is being really aggressive in the messages. NTA", "NTA\n\nThe boyfriend should have at least left your friend alone after she said no.\n\nBut got did he get their numbers? Shared groups where he could see the numbers?\n\nI find it weird to go through one people's contacts to advertise for anything. He could have send you an advertisement with his details asking whether you would share it and be okay with a no or yes. Seems a bit creepy the way he DM'd strangers.", "Unsolicited selling to strangers on social media is icky, and particularly slimy when he\u2019s invoking your name in a bid to legitimise it.\n\nNTA. He needs to cease and desist him this shit.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s HIGHLY inappropriate for your cousin or his partner to be harassing high schoolers or ANYONE on your friends list to buy his art\n\nI get you don\u2019t want to create drama but you also don\u2019t want to lose friends because they think you\u2019re involved and are trying to hard sell them\n\nTell them both to stop right now and if they get offended so be it\n\nI\u2019d also let other family members know what they\u2019re doing so you\u2019ve got backup", "By ALL means put your foot down and tell him. That asshole is spamming *your* social network and putting on the hard sell; that's worse than a multi-level marketer. I'd be enraged. NTA\n\nAnd, it may well hurt your cousin to learn that his boyfriend is an exploitive sleaze, but is it going to hurt any worse, later? He's gotta find out sometime.", "I just feel like he should know that's not appropriate before he does it to more of my friends because my friend was very confused. I don't want more of my friends reaching out to me for answers because that wastes MY time.", "The art looked mid. Not bad by any means but not $40 for a profile pic good. You're probably right though that I let it go unless it happens again, especially considering this attempt flopped so hard for him.", "I have no way to contact him directly. I'm not friends with the art account and he doesn't have any other socials. I could try to friend the art account but it would just be much easier to let my cousin know.", "Ugh I hate wording stories with a couple of the same sex. They're both men and his partner is the artist trying to sell his own art, not that it matters though. I've never even heard of an artist DMing people to sell art.", "NTA and I guarantee you his boyfriend does not know! Would you want your partner guilt tripping your friends and your friends' friends into buying overpriced art? Tell him!", "I keep rewording the post because I see how it's confusing, we graduated highschool recently I just haven't hung out with them since high school so that's why I said \"friend from high school.\"\n\nIn my mind her saying she's unemployed and him continuing to convince her is when it became unacceptable, he's basically telling her to go broke for his stupid art.", "Another option is making your account more private or limited access. Unfriend/block cousin and fiance so they can't see your friend list.", "No idea why you wouldn't try with him directly first, do you not have his number? Even if not it won't be that hard to find the art account just ask the friend that DM\u2019ed you to give you the account name? Also if this has only happened once it feels a bit dramatic to go to your cousin this quickly particularly when you don't 100% know that it's him (I get that it more than likely is but the fact of the matter if you don't 100% know)", "Because any good and self respecting artist doesn\u2019t just do it?", ">do you not have his number?\n\nNo, I barely even see my cousin let alone his fianc\u00e9 who doesn't live with him. Also I don't know how many people he has done this to, my highschool friend might just have been the first to let me know.\n\nBut anyway, I ended up just deciding make an announcement on my discord with all my closest friends to ignore him if he reaches out. Pretty much all of my friends are there including the one I mentioned in this post so at least now they're aware and it was a vague post so hopefully my cousin who is also in the server doesn't take it personally."]}
