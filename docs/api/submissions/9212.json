He apologized and brought gifts:\n\n\\- A new physical copy of my book. Now this needs an explanation: except for me, the only person who has a digital copy of my book is my older sister, Federica. Federica is a No-bullshit kind of person. If the chance of me forgiving Carl were 1 out of 10, the chance of my sister doing the same things were 1 out of 1000. When he told me he convinced my sister to give him a copy to reprint it I was astonished.\n\n\\- A full collection of figurines of the main cast of my story. There are 5 main characters in the story and only two of them were on the cover I printed, which mean that he read the book and drew/had someone else draw a sketch of the other 3 characters in order to make their figurine. They are 25cm tall and I admit they look really good.\n\n\\- He paid me back for the physical copy he destroyed. I asked him why he was giving me the money since he had just given me a new copy and his parents had already paid me. He said that the new copy was in place of the one he destroyed, while the money were an apology.\n\nHe apologized for what he did that day and explained me his reasons ( a mix of jealousy and bad timing) . Things are still not completely fine but they are better. He thanked me for bearing his hobby all these years. I apologized for losing my temper and insulting his hobby. While I don't share his passion over figurines, I can understand how much and love he put in every one of them.\n\nHe looked sincere in his apology and we parted amicably.\n\nI decided to give back to his parents the money they originally gave me as an apology. I spent a couple of hours choosing what to do with the 5 figurines he gave me. For now I put the 2 \"original\" on my desk and the other 3 on the top shelf of my library. I have to admit, having figurines made about my own book is really cool and I spent quite a lot of time looking at them in the past week.\n\nI want to thank all of you for your support on the original post.

That was actually a very awesome way for him to apologize in only the manner in which he could....by making figurines based on your book. Well done and thank you for your update!", "Aw this is lovely. Great that Carl was able to both take responsibility for his actions & find such a heartfelt way of showing you how sorry he was. The fact he put so much time & effort into creating something like the figures is just wonderful. I get that it will take some time for you to process but I really hope for both of you that you can move past what happened as it sounds like you both are great people & having that relationship where you can support & encourage hobbies of the other person even when you maybe don't get why they like it so much is just priceless. All the best to both of you \ud83d\ude42", "Honestly this is such a heartfelt apology, way beyond what I expected. \n\nWhere the figurines painted? I ask because I paint SOME, while I have a friend who paints them professionally. It's usually at least 2 hours to paint each one, or on the low end, my friend charges 25 dollars (cad) an hour to paint other people's. \n\nAlso designing mini figs, even with one of those programs that let you choose everything, takes a decent amount of time and effort (I just used one to design 5 custom dnd figures as gifts, and I sunk hours into it) \n\nAnd then, the fact that he also went and basically put himself in front of the firing squad that is your sister..\n\nNeedless to say. The amount of thought, work, and dedication in this apology should really show HOW BADLY he feels about what he did, and how much he knows it hurt you.", "Love that he made figurines of your characters!", "I kinda feel like you owe reddit some pictures of the book and the figurines now! ;-)", "This is so wholesome. I'm glad things worked out", "This is for best apology I've ever heard about! He really put a lot of time, effort and money into it.", "This is such a thoughtful apology. Thanks for the update.", "I love that he actually also read the book! I think that he's showing you he's sorry in a way he's putting effort into it - bu using his hobby to make something for yours. \n\nI love having figurines on my book shelves next to the books, they're a nice touch.", "I have to admit, this brought a tear to my eye. He did everything he could think of to apologize. The figurines of your characters sound so amazing! Wow. Whether you like his hobby or not, he sounds pretty damn talented in that area.\nGood luck to you-send the book to a publisher, cause you never know!", "OP, if you get that book published I\u2019d love to read it.", "That's about the most sincere and thoughtful apology I've ever heard about; thanks so much for sharing.", "This is an amazing apology, and kudos to you as well for giving the money back to his parents.  I hope your books and his custom figurines both end up on store shelves one day.", "Sounds subversive as hell to me. He just found a way to drag OP into the deep dark world of figurines. **/s**\n\nIt is a really nice way of apologizing though. He didn't stop at a heartfelt apology and restitution (a cold label, but best fit); he helped bring *more* life to the characters OP spent years creating. Shows a lot of appreciation for the relationship between him and OP.", ">in front of the firing squad that is your sister..\n\nI think that's the best description of my sister I have ever heard.", ">He just found a way to drag OP into the deep dark world of figurines. /s\n\nHave I just joined a cult without realizing it?", "Dang... I can't remember ever being so happy reading a /s at the end of a paragraph. i should start looking ahead, because i was really shocked by your reply until i saw it!", "Yes, yes, you have indeed joined the cult. Welcome. We have cupcakes.", "Yes but don't worry we are a nice cult", "Welcome. Enjoy!!", "I want a cupcake! Can I join?", "Don't you dare entice us with cupcakes...unless they are double chocolate cupcakes", "Cultcakes.", "So damn wholesome. I like these updates where everything worked out.", "This is the sweetest update ever! Thanks for sharing it with us, OP!", "Can you tell us what the book is about?", "That's quite possibly the sweetest apology I've ever heard of.", "That\u2019s nice", "Oh wow, this is so thoughtful that I'm super chocked up. Maybe this can be the inspiration for your next story because it's a good one!", " Congrats on completing your book!  So glad he realized how terrible his actions were, and found incredibly thoughtful ways to make up.", "This is such a wholesome update, I'm so glad things worked out for the best.", "It would take me hours to explain everything but I will try to give a small summary.\n\nThe story focus on the last days of a kingdom. The only witness who know what happened to the kingdom is walking in its ruins and she act as narrator. She briefly introduce the country, narrating the history of its creation and expansion. Then the focus shift on the last few years of the country, characterized by a cold war against the Empire. The war has been going on for years but the Kingdom and the Empire have reached a stall.\n\nThe stall is broken when a new Emperor rises to the throne and the Kingdom is forced to defend against an unstoppable force.\n\nIt's a fantasy so magic is a thing but it works in a different way than what you normally see in most fantasy, as it's closer to science and chemical reaction than it is to the \"I will transform my thought into reality.\" kind of magic.\n\nI tried to keep the summary as generic as possible but this is more or less it.", "Lol, my response to the original post was \"You're getting a figurine, be prepared\".\n\nThis was better than expected while still including a figurine!", "That sounds great! The struggle of kingdoms is a really fertile backdrop for a good story. Congratulations on finishing!", "Yes you have. And if anyone mentions a Mason Jar, you run away as fast as you can from that person.", "Yes, yes you have.", "But do you have a figurine of a cupcake?", "Are they sprinkled with the dust of deliciousness?", "What kind of cupcakes \ud83e\uddc1", "That's why they're called Fun-kos\nXD", "But do you have cupcake figurines?", "Thought they were dashed with guilt", "Well cuphead has figurines sooo...", "We had to make those as Richard destroyed all of the figurine cupcakes\u2026. and that was the last time I spent so much effort painting"]}
