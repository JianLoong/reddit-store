He apologized and brought gifts:\n\n\\- A new physical copy of my book. Now this needs an explanation: except for me, the only person who has a digital copy of my book is my older sister, Federica. Federica is a No-bullshit kind of person. If the chance of me forgiving Carl were 1 out of 10, the chance of my sister doing the same things were 1 out of 1000. When he told me he convinced my sister to give him a copy to reprint it I was astonished.\n\n\\- A full collection of figurines of the main cast of my story. There are 5 main characters in the story and only two of them were on the cover I printed, which mean that he read the book and drew/had someone else drew a sketch of the other 3 characters in order to make their figurine. They are 25cm tall and I admit they look really good.\n\n\\- He paid me back for the copy he physical copy he destroyed. I asked him why he was giving me the money since he had just given me a new copy and his parents had already paid me. He said that the new copy was in place of the one he destroyed, while the money were an apology.\n\nHe apologized for what he did that day and explained me his reasons ( a mix of jealousy and bad timing) . Things are still not completely fine but they are better. He thanked me for bearing his hobby all these years. I apologized for losing my temper and insulting his hobby. While I don't share his passion over figurines, I can understand how much and love he put in every one of them.\n\nHe looked sincere in his apology and we parted amicably.\n\nI decided to give back to his parents the money they originally gave me as an apology. I spent a couple of hours choosing what to do with the 5 figurines he gave me. For now I put the 2 \"original\" on my desk and the other 3 on the top shelf of my library. I have to admit, having figurines made about my own book is really cool and I spent quite a lot of time looking at them in the past week.\n\nI want to thank all of you for your support on the original post.

That was actually a very awesome way for him to apologize in only the manner in which he could....by making figurines based on your book. Well done and thank you for your update!", "Aw this is lovely. Great that Carl was able to both take responsibility for his actions & find such a heartfelt way of showing you how sorry he was. The fact he put so much time & effort into creating something like the figures is just wonderful. I get that it will take some time for you to process but I really hope for both of you that you can move past what happened as it sounds like you both are great people & having that relationship where you can support & encourage hobbies of the other person even when you maybe don't get why they like it so much is just priceless. All the best to both of you \ud83d\ude42"]}
