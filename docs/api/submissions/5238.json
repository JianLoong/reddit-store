Wanting a prenup is kind of common sense when you look at divorce rates. Doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't think yall will work out or he wouldn't have asked you to marry him. It's common to have moments of \"am I doing the right thing\" before getting married and if he's had others suggest to him a orenup would give him some peace of mind, it's totally reasonable that he'd be thinking about it. It's also completely reasonable for his family to look out for his best interests by suggesting he get one even if they feel there's a 99.9% chance it won't be necessary. Uninviting his sister is going to make this conflict grow.

A pre-nup is not a bad thing.  It can protect YOU, too.  My friend stipulated in her pre-nup that if divorce is a result of his infidelity, she gets US$1mil, with an additional $2mil if the divorce is after 10 years of marriage and he is unfaithful.  Her husband stipulated that if she is unfaithful, she gets a flat six-figure settlement in lieu of community property assets.  The pre-nup also has clauses about life insurance, both parties always having a valid will, all kinds of stuff.  It\u2019s all about NEGOTIATION, which is fundamental to any marriage (y\u2019know\u2026 give, take, compromise).

A prenup will help both you and him if thing ever ends, so it's not a red flag or meaning that things are gonna end just because you guys are prepared IF things do end. If she treats you bad (which doesn't seem to be the case in this post) then NTA, but if she hasn't then YTA.", "Getting a prenuptial is also about both individuals' assets and protecting both. I am in a field (medicine) in which lawsuits are common. We got a prenup to protect my HUSBAND'S assets from possibly being threatened by a future lawsuit going after me.", "YWBTA - the only reason to object to a prenup is because you have designs on his family money or want the ability to hold an implicit threat of such designs over him in the relationship.  Otherwise, it's merely a statement of respect between two parties that establishes that neither is entitled to the other's prior hard work and/or family assets.\n\nDivorces happen.  You should join him in the drafting process of the prenup to make sure that both of you are protected in the event that your union isn't forever.  The ability to think dispassionately and to prize your interests as well as those of your partner, even when those interests are in opposition, is critical to a lasting relationship.  Your pettiness regarding his sister and naked self-interest surrounding the prenup itself should be a gigantic red flag to your love.", "YWBTA. \n\n1) If your fiance chooses to insist on a prenup, then that is on him, not your SIL. Your SIL can suggest it; she cannot *make* him do it. You would be mad at the wrong person.\n\n2) Your SIL is right to care about your fiance's finances and future. She is his sister. She is being practical.\n\n3) You seeing a prenup as him \"anticipating that you won't last forever\" is rather hypocritical, considering how upset you are. By your logic, you wouldn't be so angry at the idea of a prenup--unless you're *also* anticipating that you won't last forever. If you really thought your marriage would be forever, a prenup wouldn't affect you in the slightest. It would be irrelevant. \n\nStop being mad at your SIL. Talk to your fiance.

No. But it is smart to spell out what will happen in the future. It\u2019s not a \u2018when\u2019 it\u2019s an \u2018if\u2019. You are thinking with your emotions and not your head.

The prenup doesn't matter. If it goes badly? Then the prenup is there to support you BOTH when you're already in a stressful situation and might make bad choices out of anger or wanting to escape.  \n\n\nHis sister talking to him isn't \"Behind your back\" it's family bringing up something important to do. You seem a lot more invested in the idea of possibly ever not having a good relationship than you are with actually having a good relationship right now.   \n\n\nIf you still consider a prenup a \"red flag\" then it's a time to have a reasonable adult conversation about it with your fiance. Not to claim it \"really\" means something else and start a fight about it.", "YTA. I know that finances and prenups can be very uncomfortable, but honestly it sounds like he has a lot more to lose than you do in this case. If you were the one from a wealthy family I'm pretty sure that your opinion would be different. Attacking his sister over supporting her brother is not a good idea. The prenup would also protect his assets in case of a lawsuit or debt issued against you. He's just protecting himself.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don't like prenups, that's fine and that's something to work out with your fianc\u00e9.  But you can't fault people for bringing up completely valid legal options and making sure all options have been considered.  That's all his sister did.  Whether he decides to act on that and how he goes about that?  That's all him.  He had the choice to not consider it at all regardless what anyone else says...and he's not choosing that.  He's choosing to explore the option.  That's on your fianc\u00e9, not the sister and you're choosing a lifetime of a strained in-law relationship by going nuclear on this.\n\nI do think you're doing yourself a disservice by letting your emotional feelings about them rule and not similarly exploring the option with your fiance.  Maybe your decision is the same when all is said and done, but it's important to make an educated decision, not an emotional one.\n\nPrenups are contractual agreements and they make a lot of sense in some situations, particularly when one party comes in with significantly more assets than the other or they have assets combined with other family members (like a family business).  They are designed to protect both parties coming into the marriage.  They are not, by design, intended to screw over the party with less and often lop-sided prenups get thrown out by the court.\n\nYou know what else is a contract?  Marriage.  At the end of the day, marriage is a contract and you're kidding yourself if you think that contract doesn't already have a prenup built into it.  I realize you're focused on all the lovey dovey romance of a wedding, but at the end of the day you're entering into a legally binding agreement to combine your lives together - similar to starting a business with someone and creating an LLC.  And in the legally binding agreement, if you choose to not create a prenuptial contract of your own devising, then what you're doing is letting the government of wherever you are decide who gets what if you split up instead of making that decision yourself in advance when the two of you still like each other.  So you don't have the absence of a prenuptial agreement...that is your prenuptial agreement - you're saying \"As our prenuptial agreement, we choose to let the local laws and a judge decide who gets what if we ever separate.\"", "YTA.

Looking out for the well-being of family doesn\u2019t mean you are scheming. \n\nAt this point, you need to start considering whether or not you will sign a prenup. If you won\u2019t, there isn\u2019t any point to spend any Christmases with these people - fianc\u00e9 included. If you are willing to sign it, you are just going to drive your fianc\u00e9 away anyway by excluding his SIL at Christmas.", "YWBTA.\n\nWorking for a family law attorney for decades, prenups can be good things. Everything is right up front and everyone knows exactly where they stand. A good prenup covers BOTH parties' interests. Of course you are entitled to have your own attorney vet and approve it. If the proposed prenup doesn't protect you or hangs you completely out to dry, THAT would be the red flag. \n\nFor all the couples we did prenups for, we never did divorces.", "YWBTA. First, prenups don\u2019t necessarily mean what you think they mean. They can actually be a great vehicle for ensuring that your relationship DOES last, because you both enter into it having had meaningful discussions about some of the most complex issues most couples face in a marriage. Second, his sister is almost certainly not the one driving this because, like your husband, it\u2019s not her money\u2014it\u2019s the parents, and their parents, etc. She may have done more thinking about it than your brother has, because women often think more about weddings and marriage, but having a conversation about her family situation with a member of her family is not a comment on you. Third, fighting a prenup in this way is a BAD look. It has a way of making you look like exactly what you (hopefully) are not\u2014a woman who is only in it for the money and ready to fight for \u201cher\u201d share of money that is not hers because it\u2019s not even her husband\u2019s! He had nothing to do with making that money, so you\u2019re certainly not entitled to it as a part of your marriage.

At the same time, if OP says \"prenups are a red flag\" and I refuse to even have this conversation or consider the idea and I'm even going to uninvite my SIL as punishment\", then maybe OP's husband should realize OP is an asshole that he shouldn't marry.", "Not really, no. \n\nThe purpose of a prenup isn\u2019t to fuck over your spouse in a divorce, and if you think your spouse wants a prenup in order to fuck you over then you shouldn\u2019t be marrying them.

If they refuse and don\u2019t want to help you both get treated fairly, then they\u2019re not a good partner and the prenup is irrelevant. It\u2019s all well and good to say \u201cI don\u2019t want a business agreement\u201d, but a legally-recognized wedding in a lot of ways already is a business agreement. It entitles you and your spouse to a whole host of financial benefits. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s absolutely not true that medical malpractice insurance completely prevents any possibility of personal assets being seized. Even if it only happens rarely, a patient plaintiff can absolutely make a claim on personal assets any part of a judgment not covered by the insurance.
