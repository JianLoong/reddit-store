First is the illusion of comfort.  Do you know the angle of the back of your couch?  If you could reduce that at head height by two inches towards the wall, would it make the couch comfier?  No.  But you might feel like you've got a choice.\n\nAnd the second is it's useful in long haul flights to keep your back comfortable by changing it every now and then.  I start with mine in the upright position for as long as I can stand, then a few hours later I'll recline it for a while until the next meal service so my back is using slightly different muscles.  Leave it up from meal service until I'm starting to ache a little, then recline again until the next meal service.  \n\nWhen the seatbelt sign goes off after taking I slowly shake my head at the sound of all these chairs slamming into recliner positions immediately.

I don't stand up, I don't grab my overhead bag, I don't twitch like a rabid frog.  Everyone else can go first.  At that point when the seatbelt sign is off (usually long after so many seatbelt buckles have made the click sound) I use the little button on the inside of the armrest to flip the armrests up into their cleaning position so I can just chill out for a bit.\n\nReclining is a sad trick that makes so many people angry.

If they stopped letting any old person buy an exit row or the first bay of seats, it'd probably sort itself out. Plus just common courtesy among humans.

The space your seat reclines into belongs to you, it is simply bonus space for the person behind you when you aren\u2019t using it. It is polite and customary to put your seat upright during meals, which you did as asked (but he was a passive aggressive weirdo for not asking you to do so directly). He and his wife are a couple of obnoxious old cranks for behaving that way. My job is about 20% plane travel and I go on vacation often. People almost always recline, it\u2019s like an inch in a half of space and the chair is literally built to allow reclining - this is way too hot of a debate topic for a straightforward seat amenity.\n\nEdit to add: his height is irrelevant. If you\u2019re tall, sorry, but take it up with the airline or get an aisle/exit/front/comfort plus seat. Planes are uncomfortable, but you can\u2019t ask someone else not to use their seat functionality because you\u2019re tall.", "I read on of these months ago but it was a man who did this to a woman.  He got chastised for doing the exact same thing you did.\n\nOp, NTA.  You paid for your space, i am glad you used it", "NTA - and I would\u2019ve flatly responded to the wife \u201cNo\u2026 not really.\u201d", "So instead of making the man next to you stop being spread eagle to the point of encroaching into your space, you decided to encroach upon a third unrelated party. I'm not really loving that logic there to be honest.", "It can on some planes, before I started trying to always fly business or first class, my knees touched the seat in front of me(I am short but most of my height is my legs), so if the person in front of me reclined, I was guaranteed bruises that took forever to heal.  I'm not saying that was the case here necessarily,  but I can testify sometimes even 1 inch makes a big difference on some planes.", "OK, boomer.  LOL.", "Any airline flying into or out of the US is **required** to accommodate disabilities under the Air Carrier Access Act. They are not required to accommodate height. \n\nIt\u2019s an important distinction.", "You can\u2019t tell. My disability is hidden. You won\u2019t see the four inch long scar across my back where they took the tumor off of my spine.\n\nYou also can\u2019t tell in day to day living as I\u2019m moving around and don\u2019t seize up. \n\nUnfortunately, airplanes seat construction actually exacerbates the condition. They managed to make the angle just right. If they made the seats rear facing the problem would go away.", "No shit Sherlock. Idk what you're arguing here. Just looking for an argument for no reason. I was simply relaying another point of view to the comment above me.", "I can't tell, but I assume that people know about their own bodies. If you don't actually need to, and just want to, reclining is selfish because you're encroaching on someone else's space because you wanna.\n\nAgain, at the very least, I ask that people give a heads up before reclining. I like my laptop in one piece and my tray and everything on it not being suddenly sliding into my gut. If you're gonna inconvenience someone, least you could do is warn them so they can adjust things on their end", "The recline will make or break my flight. \n\nI think it\u2019s fair to raise a counterpoint to your argument.\n\nIt\u2019s also important that this isn\u2019t just a courtesy issue.", "Reclining **prevents** the issue from happening in the first place. If you wait until pain then it is already too late. Medical accommodations are required under the Air Carrier Access Act. \n\nFrankly, expecting to work on a laptop while seated in economy is a little unrealistic.", "Okay, well I can't choose my height but there is medication to take to stop your back spasms, stetching routines, core stengthening excersise. Maybe you could have taken more care of yourself in your life to not end up with a bad back. Fat people have to buy an extra seat because of life choices, maybe you should too.", "Like I already said, legit medical issues are one thing - we can't always control our health. But reclining not because you need to for health reasons but because you're willing to make someone else uncomfortable just to make yourself more comfortable, without medical need, is selfish.\n\nWhy is working on a laptop unrealistic? It's a small item that fits easily on the tray table. Just like reclining, the tray table is part of what's provided as part of the purchase of a ticket, and thus available for people to use - except opening doesn't actively encroach on anyone's space. I just want to be able to adjust my laptop and the table before it gets caught on the back of a reclining seat."]}
