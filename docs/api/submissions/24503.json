Yeah, I never got this whole complaint.  Every airplane that I've been on, the seats barely recline and it's certainly not like you're in the lap of the person behind you.

I can't imagine sitting upright on overnight flights, for example.  How is one supposed to sleep?

They do not get the same amount of space.\n\nAlso, I have had a book on the tray table so I can read, and it was squished due to the passenger in front of me reclining.  the person who reclined minimized the space I had to use as a desk.
