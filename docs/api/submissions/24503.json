Having the seat in front of you reclined is annoying generally, but I\u2019ve had people slam their seats back so hard it knocks my stuff off the tray table, which is just obnoxious.", "NTA you are entitled to the reclined space, he can regain those 2 inches by reclining his chair. If he needs extra space than that he needs to pay for an upgrade", "Seats recline. And reclining is expected on an 8 hour flight. So NTA.  You don't have to ask permission to recline.  It is wise to go slowly or make it known so the person behind can watch their tray table or especially a lap top.", "Oh, like reclining 2\u201d or so really really hurt the guy behind you. If you weren\u2019t allowed to do it, they would have taken the recline button/lever off your seat.

And I\u2019m NOT a small person!", "NTA: airplane seats recline. You should expect that the one in front of you will do so at any time during the flight it is permitted.", "NTA and you don't have to defend yourself for the space you did/didn't give or take.  If you couldn't recline your seat, it wouldn't recline.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHe recling function is there for just that purpose: to recline them.", "NTA, as long as seats have an option to recline, I use it and so should you.\n\n1) Yes, seats are tiny, but you can select a seat with bigger leg space if needed. So people who want extra comfort are free to do so.\n\n2) seats have this option, meaning you can use it\n\n3) what if person in front reclines? I'd personally have a claustrophobic episode on a long flight if I don't recline as well to have some space\n\n4) how do you sleep on a long flight if not reclined? I personally end up with motion sickness unless I sleep at least half way through an 8-9 hour fligh.

Designed or not, it's still an invasion of space. It directly reduces the space available to the person behind you. It's also not fun to have a tray table slide into you without warning, and god forbid if you have a laptop on it and it gets caught on the chair back. Nearly had mine damaged that way before. I hear tall people also have issues with not having enough space\n\nFinally, airlines are TA for trying to pack passengers in like sardines with no regard to comfort", "NTA.\n\nYou are not to blame because the seats are made to recline and that airplanes are designed in uncomfortable ways. That old guy was a dick so for sure, his  tantrum makes me less sympathetic.\n\nAnd,  I get some men are larger/taller but I'm done with them expecting women to become smaller and take up the least amount of space and center random strange men in any public space.", "NTA - nope.

Are you...are you *really?*", "NTA\nNo, you paid for a seat and he is trying to steal your space", "NTA. I hate reclining seats on airplanes and I hate it when the person in front of me reclines, BUT as long as the seats recline that is the airline\u2019s fault, not the fault of the person who uses the seat as it\u2019s designed.

If someone reclines and it bothers you, you can also recline and it will be literally the same amount of space.  I think this is a control and asserting power over other kinds of issues.  \n\nThe other person literally complained loudly the entire flight instead of simply reclining.  They are a total asshole because they had the power to rectify the situation but chose to bully a woman the entire flight instead.  I wouldn't have stopped reclining, for sure.", "LOL yes I\u2019ll keep you updated. Maybe I should just audibly fart in his direction for the rest of the flight, lol."]}
