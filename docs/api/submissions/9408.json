It doesn\u2019t really matter if it was a destroyed Lego model or a deleted video game save file or wrecked painting.  The item itself is irrelevant.\n\nThere was a blatant lack of respect and value for OP\u2019s property and passions.

It was obviously super important to him as it was IN A DISPLAY CASE.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re family\u201d feels like a bit of a cop out.
