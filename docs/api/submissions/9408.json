Sometimes they have the occasional miscount listed but will tell you before they ship and give you a credit back. \n\nThis is what he should do.  I know it will take him hours to catalog and figure out how many parts he needs but he should just out of pettiness.  \n\nOp is NTA and I'd they won't pay sue them for it.  Maybe Judy Justice will even pick it up and I can laugh and laugh about what she would say about the stupidity of so.eo e who broke something and refused to fix/pay for it.  \n\nSheesh!!", "Iirc the Lego website has a store that you can look for individual pieces in", "Agreed!", "Brickset is a good LEGO resource but it can make sense to link right to BrickLink especially if shopping for replacements - same content but different terminology - https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=75192-1", "I would say, get the $250 directly from them and instead of buying a cheaper set, catalogue the missing pieces and see if LEGO will replace them.

He would have to completely dismantle it and check it against the manual to see what pieces are missing, then build the whole thing again with the new pieces. Putting it together takes HOURS and HOURS (my son has it, and I built it for him, so I know), but disassembling it would likely take twice as long (when you want the pieces to come off, they are quite stubborn), then he\u2019d have to check every piece against the list. Do you know how long that would take???", "I know that these sets when broken are nearly impossible to piece back together.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s huge and heavy but you can still pick it up", "I guess it sucks to be the asshole who insisted on breaking stated boundaries.
