My wife and her other siblings felt bad about it and went ahead and threw her a gender reveal party at her other sibling's house.

She wanted to use our house for it this time because our house is a bit bigger so we can invite more of their relatives and more of her friends. My wife knew I'd be against using our house because we always end up doing all the decorations and end up cleaning the mess after. I also told her doing a surprise party for someone else's milestones are never a good idea, but whatever. She said she'll do all the planning and only invite the people closest to her sister. I was okay with that idea and the planning continued.\n\n\nA week or so later, her sister found out we're doing a surprise baby shower for her because she went through her boyfriend's text messages and saw their convos. She then reached out to my wife and told her that she doesn't want us to throw her a baby shower because she wants it a particular way and she doesn't want to be upset if it doesn't turn out the way she envisioned. My wife was shocked by this. I was not.\n\n\nI thought this works out for me as I really didn't want to do all of that work. Until she tells me that she still wants to use our house and use our money for the decoration and the food that her sister chooses. I told her absolutely not because her sisters' ideas of partying includes a lot of alcohol, drama and disrespect to other people's properties and the party would not go far before I tell everyone to gtfo the house.\n\n\nNow she tells her sister this (who is still living with us, btw) and now is upset with me because she has no money to pay for a venue for this event. I suggested using her other sister's house and she complained that she doesn't have the layout that she's envisioned for her party. I said too bad and left it at that as I thought there was no point of arguing with her.\n\n\nMy wife agrees with me but she doesn't know if she's being bias since I'm her husband. Her other sibling thinks I'm an asshole because they already did the previous party at their house so it's our \"turn.\" And her pregnant sister obviously thinks I'm an asshole because the house isn't technically in my name and I don't pay the mortgage (I pay for the rest of our bills and food, though, but she doesn't realize that all that adds up costing more than the mortgage) so I shouldn't get to decide.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676240359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110ryvw/aita_for_not_allowing_my_sil_to_use_our_house_and/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
