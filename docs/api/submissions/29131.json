{"id": 29131, "submission_id": "17a5nmw", "title": "AITA for having my neighbors friend\u2019s car towed?", "selftext": "I have a neighbor whose guest blocks my mailbox when they visit (2-3 times a week). Everyone\u2019s lawn is fairly large and they technically have plenty of space to park in front of my neighbors house, so while I find it weird that they\u2019d rather park in front of my home I wouldn\u2019t fuss over just that. My problem is my son has medications that get delivered via USPS bi-weekly. Twice I\u2019ve received an \u201cundeliverable\u201d notice from the mailwoman because of the car blocking my mailbox so often. I have already been next door multiple times to speak to the neighbor about it and explain the situation to them. I only asked that they don\u2019t park there during mail delivery hours so I can make sure I\u2019m actually getting my mail, especially since my work schedule doesn\u2019t usually afford me the ability to just go to the post office to pickup undelivered mail immediately. They seemed nice enough about it but the behavior hadn\u2019t changed.\n\nYesterday it happened again. So instead of going back over there I called the non-emergency line to file a complaint and told them what was going on. I\u2019d already called them a few days before to ask what my options were and was told the driver could be ticketed if police were called out there because blocking the mailbox (or parking within 15 feet of a residential mailbox) is against the local ordinance. I did not know the police could either ticket or tow the car at their discretion, so when I called I was expecting them to get a light ticket. \n\nWell the officer that came out decided to tow it. Now my neighbor is angry and demanding I reimburse them at least partially for the towing & storage fees because I could have just asked them to move the car instead of calling the police. I do feel bad because I wasn\u2019t expecting the car to be towed but my thing is I\u2019ve already asked multiple times for them to not block my mailbox during delivery hours. Part of me wants to just give them some money because I\u2019m not trying to cause issues with my neighbors, but another part of me doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my fault even though I\u2019m the one that called the police. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your input. I\u2019m just getting home from work and reading all of the responses. I just moved to this neighborhood roughly 3 months ago and it\u2019s been an issue since the first week. You\u2019re all correct and I feel much better about calling the police because at the end of the day they were selfish enough to not care about my kid, so why should I care about their car. I won\u2019t be paying them anything and if they insist on bothering me about it, as someone suggested, I can call the police for harassment. \n\nI did give them a lot of warning so the fees are on them. Hopefully this whole thing is over. When I came home today the guest (I think it\u2019s my neighbors boyfriend) was visiting again but he was parked in their driveway instead. They were out there talking and made it a point to stare me down as I was backing into my garage. So there\u2019s tension but they\u2019ll have to get over it. \n\nTo the people suggesting I get cameras, I had a security system installed a few weeks after I moved in. It\u2019s just me and my son so there are cameras covering every angle of the house, including on that looks out onto the street and my mailbox. Hopefully they\u2019re not dense enough to tamper with my mail or any packages placed in there because I will not hesitate to press every charge the cops can think of. \n\nThank you again for your kind words and encouragement! I feel much better about how I handled it now.", "created_utc": 1697568811, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a5nmw/aita_for_having_my_neighbors_friends_car_towed/", "score": 1094, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I spoke to the police about what my options were the guy I spoke to said if it happened again and I called, they could be ticketed by the officer that comes out. So when it happened again and I called the police I wasn't expecting the car to be towed. My neighbor had to help their guest pay to get their car back and because of that my neighbor is saying that I need to pay them back because I didn't need to call police when I could have just come to ask them to move their car. I feel bad because I did not know the officer had the option to ticket or tow, I was told they would be ticketed. Towing does cost A LOT more than a parking ticket, so part of me feels responsible for it but another part of me doesn't feel like I need to help with any fees because I had already requested they not block my mailbox and my requests went ignored for several weeks. While I didn't mean to have the car towed and I feel bad about the extra money it cost them, they shouldn't have parked in front of my mailbox.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Everyone\u2019s lawn is fairly large and they technically have plenty of space to park in front of my neighbors house, so while I find it weird that they\u2019d rather park in front of my home I wouldn\u2019t fuss over just that. My problem is my son has medications that get delivered via USPS bi-weekly. Twice I\u2019ve received an \u201cundeliverable\u201d notice from the mailwoman because of the car blocking my mailbox so often. I have already been next door multiple times to speak to the neighbor about it and explain the situation to them. I only asked that they don\u2019t park there during mail delivery hours so I can make sure I\u2019m actually getting my mail, especially since my work schedule doesn\u2019t usually afford me the ability to just go to the post office to pickup undelivered mail immediately. They seemed nice enough about it but the behavior hadn\u2019t changed.\n\nYesterday it happened again. So instead of going back over there I called the non-emergency line to file a complaint and told them what was going on. I\u2019d already called them a few days before to ask what my options were and was told the driver could be ticketed if police were called out there because blocking the mailbox (or parking within 15 feet of a residential mailbox) is against the local ordinance. I did not know the police could either ticket or tow the car at their discretion, so when I called I was expecting them to get a light ticket. \n\nWell the officer that came out decided to tow it. Now my neighbor is angry and demanding I reimburse them at least partially for the towing & storage fees because I could have just asked them to move the car instead of calling the police. I do feel bad because I wasn\u2019t expecting the car to be towed but my thing is I\u2019ve already asked multiple times for them to not block my mailbox during delivery hours. Part of me wants to just give them some money because I\u2019m not trying to cause issues with my neighbors, but another part of me doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my fault even though I\u2019m the one that called the police.

Don't give them a penny", "You might want to take away the word accidentally in your end statement.\n\nThere wasn't anything accidentally about them Parking in front of your mailbox multiple times Especially since you were so nice to ask them not to do so.\n\nThey were lazy and disrespectful to you.\n\nDon't worry about inconsiderate aholes.", "Screw that, you DID tell them MULTIPLE times! Did he need it in braille? He obviously didn\u2019t give a crap about your child needing their medication. So he can suck it.", "NTA at all, you asked them nicely and he kept doing it. It was against the law and they paid the price and SHOULD pay the price. \n\nWe had to do the same when a neighbor would have people over that would park in front of our house, sometimes so far up that they were on the edge of our driveway so it was a tight turn to turn in if we were making a right turn into the driveway. It took them parking  partially on the grass and getting a ticket for them to finally stop (because the water, gas and sewer lines all run under the grassy area between the sidewalk and road, vehicles can't park on the grass). Thankfully they were evicted for other stuff soon after.", "I guess your not the AH, but in reality you do not own the street in front of your house. It is public property. There is now laws prohibiting the blocking access to a mailbox. The curb would need to be marked or a \u201cNo Parking\u201d sign posted by the City to prohibit parking for the police to issue a ticket. As for towing, man, I would be filing suit against the City and the Officer that had it done personally. He had no legal authority to have the car towed from what is explained here.  Was he a jerk? Yes, yes he was. Is that illegal? No, no it is not!", "Yes your a fucking dick just go ask again and again", "NTA. Talking to them didn't work; it's their own fault the car was towed. DON'T YOU DARE GIVE THEM A PENNY!!!", "NTA.", "NTA.  Seriously, they were repeatedly parking illegally in a way that inconvenienced you.  You repeatedly asked them to stop.  They didn\u2019t care and kept doing it anyway.  If their stupid choices caused them to get towed, oh well.  Is it really that hard to park in a considerate and legal manner?", "NTA. You did ask them to move their car- they continued to park there in complete disregard for the fact that they were actively influencing your son\u2019s access to medication.

They\u2019re TA and now they\u2019re dealing with the consequences of their actions.", "NTA.  You made them aware of the issue and they ignored it.  Now the consequences are on them.  Reminds me of my father-in-law.  He got along well with his neighbour and their driveways were side by side.  However, there was a lady who visited the neigbour who always parked on FIL's driveway, despite being asked not to on several occasions.  In the end, FIL just jacked up her car and put it on blocks, then went out and left her stranded.  She learned it was best to park out on the street!", "> I could have just asked them to move the car\n\nYou did, multiple times, and it didn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not your fault they didn\u2019t listen. NTA at all.", "NTA. They can get (more) bent", "NTA! You've told your neighbors countless times to not have their guests blocking your mailbox. It's not your fault that you had no choice but to get the police involved. it's your neighbors fault that they decided to not tell their guests to not park in front of your mailbox. You had the rights to get the police involved and literally have the car towed away because that guest made its bed and now they lie in it. Honestly they deserve the consequences of their actions because you have a son that needs medications delivered by mail and neighbors refuses to cooperate with you and the mail carrier. The neighbor really don't care about your son and his well-being at all. All they care about is themselves and that's it. Also don't pay them for the situation. They're not worth it at all. Your son's well-being is more important than them forcing you to pay partial of the situation.", "NTA. Their rude behavior got their car towed. Don\u2019t give them a penny.", "Your mail lady can't walk to the door with a package of medications?? If mine can't get to the mailbox, he makes damn sure he knocks and forces me to answer the door so that he can inform me that there is a car blocking the box. Yours can leave an \"undeliverable\" notice but can't use that time to walk it to your door? \n\nYou're NTA, but can't say the same for the postal worker that delivers to your house", "The way I would\u2019ve smiled and wave at them every time we saw each other would make my day.

NTA", "NTA\nYou offered the courtesy of a conversation .\nThen you mentioned it was an issue.\nThen you were unable to receive your mail\nThese people are dense.\nThey tested the limits of your patience. \nThey FA and Found Out\nToo bad for them.\nFunny how they aren't parking adjacent to your mailbox any longer", "NTA.   The neighbor\u2019s friend won\u2019t learn until it starts hurting them in the wallet.", "They didn\u2019t care because they didn\u2019t have any consequences. You asked them very very nicely multiple times not to park there, if they were so worried about a consequence, they would\u2019ve listened one of those times at least. \n\nThey\u2019re just angry because you decided that it was no longer your problem and very squarely placed the problem right back on their shoulders.", "Just FYI, tampering with mail is a federal crime.", "Next time they glare at you, give a friendly wave.", "NTA. Just smile and wave as they stare!", "Your child needs their meds NTA you told them and they either forgot or did not care fuck em tie their car again if they don\u2019t change", "You did ask them. Multiple times. NTA.", "Tell them to call the cop to get their money. It wasn\u2019t your decision to have it towed, it was the PO. You\u2019ve asked politely like a good neighbor and they didn\u2019t care. Lesson learned.", "NTA   \nand no why the f would you pay for anything? they did something they knew was wrong. that's one them, what kinda cockadoodle clown even think he can ask for a reimburse???", "NTA!  Tell them to kick rocks.", "NTA\n\nIt looks like the mailbox situation is similar to the fire hydrant laws where you live. So don't feel bad because technically what they're doing is considered illegal and #2 a hazard to your son's health because he can't get his medicine. I wouldn't let the tension get to you and just either wave or say some nice comment like \"great weather we're having here today\" or just wave with a smile.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYou'd already talked to them about it, and they chose to ignore it.\n\nThe fact it was so egregious that the cops towed it shows exactly how at fault he was. He can pound sand, don't pay a dime.\n\nIf he continues to harass, document it for the cops", "NTA. Have it towed every time. \n\nThe neighbor and visitor are choosing to fuck around. \n\nThey need to find out. Every time.", "You did ask them to move the car. Yet they kept parking there. Stupid games, stupid prizes. NTA.", "Nta they parked illegally they have to face reprocessing you have warned them plenty of occasional and they never learnt I would say they ask you to pay again ask them to pay you kids medical bills given they have disruppedbed his medical needs", "Yeah, why should you pay them fir blocking your house? The idea is that they not do that any more. Pay them and they have an incentive to keep doing it.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA. At the point you can't get medications for your child...come on.", "NTA. Send them a bill for the time you have had to spend getting the medication because of the parking. Gas, your time all of it.", "Nta\n\nI\u2019m so glad you did what you did. Absolutely do not give them one red cent.", "Op, you aren\u2019t causing the issues with the neighbor.  He is and only way he will stop forever from blocking your mailbox is by having to pay the tow fee.  He can holler all he wants about you asking and you can respond with the months of you asking politely.  Then simply refuse to engage.  I am petty enough to ask these adults why they were trying to kill your child by deliberately denying and delaying his medication.", "You did go over and ask, several times. And explained why it was a problem. It's to be regretted if they forgot they shouldn't block mailboxes even after the reminder but perhaps they'll find it easier to remember another time.", "NTA. Your neighbor is a jerk. Tow that car every time.", "NTA. Came to this late, but it seems others have given the advice I would. I was horrified at the thought that you might help them pay the fine. I'd also go to never allowing parking there, if they bring it up with you directly. I wouldn't approach them with that, as keeping your distance seems safer, but if they harass you directly, say you gave them more than a fair option and they didn't take it, so now it's No Parking, full stop. Ignore their stares.", "tell them to go sue you. Dont be a puss cake, dont give them money.", "NTA.  You already tried talking to them multiple times.  You shouldn\u2019t have to keep doing that.  You owe them nothing.  It was at the discretion of the officer that responded.", "NTA: Neighbor and their guest are TA's, as to your edit about the cameras. The police may not do much for tampering with the mail, but the USPS Postal Inspector cares, and will for sure drop a hammer on them if they decide to mess with a FEDERALLY PROTECTED asset. Mail Tampering is a Federal offense with steeeeep fines/jail time.", "And the kid's meds ARE good and holy!  And so are mailmen!   And UPS guys!  And everyone else that law was designed to protect!", "Generally, if there isn't much parking on the streets or in drives, the mailboxes will be on the houses. Street mailboxes tend to be in suburban places with tons of parking and the mail carrier is mostly not even getting out of their vehicle, so you'll usually find the governing body has put exactly that kind of rule in place so the carrier can reach said boxes, about a car length.", "That\u2019s a great way of putting it into perspective", "I'm sure the impound lot explained exactly why they were towed. OP does not need to talk to her neighbors, ever. NTA", "My thought also.  I wonder if the police contacted the local postal inspector and they were the one who said \"tow it\".\n\nNTA", ". . . In the US", "The only way that OP could have been less the asshole is by explicitly informing them that they will be calling the nonemergency line in 20 minutes, if the car is not moved to be parked, somewhere, legal, and every time this happens going forward; they were under no obligation to do that.

The inconvenience of not getting your medicine on time ?\n\nBesides they parked illegally not you. \n\nTheir problem and if they ever say anything ask them if they want to reimburse you for the hassle and cost  and time of having the items  re shipped and that YOU didn't do anything illegal AND asked them nicely to NOT park there anymore.", "If they continue to FAFO, please post the video, but definitely not just to satisfy our collective justice boner.", "OP most likely lives on a rural route- usps contract states that rural carriers are not required to dismount the vehicle to deliver mail to blocked curbside boxes- safety but also due to how they are paid (by the piece, not the time) and arent required to deliver park and loops/dismounts (boxes at the door).\n\n City carriers on the other hand are required to dismount and deliver to blocked boxes where it is safe to do so. If a carrier encounters continual delivery issues with an address, tge postmaster can restrict delivery until the issue is abated by the customer.", "I agree. OP is not causing issues, neighbor is. I think this comes under the heading \"FAFO.\"", "That is where USPS operates, yes.", ">FAFO\n\nThey did both.", "That\u2019s\u2026 the literal meaning of the acronym, mate."]}
