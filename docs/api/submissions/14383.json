In my opinion, you need to have a conversation with her about splitting costs. If she is making more then you, but contributing very little towards the bottom line then there is a significant problem. I'm assuming that you don't have a shared bank account? May I ask, what does she spend her money on if you're paying for the outings and the 60% towards debt repayment (which is already pretty insane TBH). \n\nIt borderline sounds like she is using you, being frank, I would run for the hills.", "NTA\n\nYou need to have some adult discussions and make some hard decisions about how you handle finances. \n\nIt may be that you both contribute a fixed percentage of your respective salaries into a joint account from which only agreed expenses are taken - rent/ mortgage, groceries, insurance, etc.\n\nThe rest you keep in personal accounts.\n\nIf your wife wants to go out more, she needs to put her own money where her mouth is and pay for it.", "NTA. Where does her money go? Does she pay bills? Money is one of the biggest reasons for divorce. You need to be splitting bills equally and paying for going out equally at this point in the relationship. You probably shouldn\u2019t get married since you\u2019re already having so many issues. You need to stop and reflect on this relationship. Love isn\u2019t enough.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to pay when she wants to go out or stay at home.\n\nEdit, the other thing I wanted to say was maybe you need to both contribute to a home fund and a leisure fund and when it's finished its finished,\nBut then I notices though you call her your wife you mention saving up for a wedding and honeymoon", "NTA \n\n>shes called me out and said I need to make more money\n\nRun away bro, she sounds terrible.", "NTA this doesn't seem equal or even fair, she should be contributing to household expenses at the least, your supposed to be partners.", "NTA but this needs to stop now.

I'd reconsider going forward with her.  NTA", "NAH - money is always a source of conflict in relationships.  Who does the cooking when you don\u2019t go out?  If she does, volunteer to cook a few days a week.  She may just want a (well-deserved) break from her cooking duties.", "NTA. If you can\u2019t say No now; it\u2019s only going to be worse later.\n\nBefore getting married is the time to figure this out.

The cost can be shared, or she can pay for herself!", "NTA.

You're trying to build a better future for the both of you, and that includes financial planning.\n\nYou two need to have a serious conversation about finances, now, before any wedding planning is happening and certainly before you get married. You should be splitting costs - in this case she's making more than you, there's no reason she shouldn't pay 50% of costs or even more due to the gap in income. You also need to set expectations about spending, saving, and getting your accounts in order for when you're married. Explain to her you're not opposed to going out, but if she wants to go out every weekend she needs to contribute to the household and to these outings as well.\n\nIf she can't have this kind of discussion - it's a big problem, OP. It means she can't have a serious discussion and get to a resolution; Can't plan for long-term goals; isn't financially responsible; or, is simply selfish and has a grand ol time mooching off you while saving all her money. All of these things, together and individually, are very problematic and I'd go as far as saying you don't want to marry someone like that.\n\nI'm not saying she is any of those things, but the success of such a conversation will be highly indicative of how worried you should be about these concerns.", "This, what does she pay for? You don't split bills 50/50? Or based on income? What about the future? How will you save money? Does she save money?", "Seems way over the border. She's using him, he's oblivious.

Have a conversation with her and if the situation doesn\u2019t change, you run because tbh she sounds horrible.", "So what she earns is hers and what YOU earn is mostly hers.
