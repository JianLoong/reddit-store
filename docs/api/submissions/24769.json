She might've had good intentions, but it was really in bad taste imo. And even then she could just gracefully accept your refusal and the situation would be over. But because she doesn't let it go by the looks of it, she's being the asshole here.", "NTA hell no should she wear it. If it fits with your dress maybe it could be your \"something old\" for your wedding.", "NTA, it\u2019s your necklace and you can do what you want with it. Are you doing something else to honor your mom the day of? Maybe you could wear the necklace.", "NTA\n\nHer intentions *may* be good but what two families does she want to unite? Yours and your fianc\u00e9s or between you and her?  \n\nEvery time you see the necklace on her you\u2019re only going to think three things:\n\n1. Your mom is physically gone forever\n2. Your mom is t there for an important life event\n3. She thinks she\u2019s your mother now. \n\nTaking her side is not your dad keeping the peace. Dad explaining the above points is him keeping the peace. \n\nMy dad has been gone more years than I\u2019ve been alive. It was incredibly hard not to have him give me away. In just about all of my pictures during the ceremony I look kissed off when really I was trying to focus on other things other than my dad not being there.", "NTA.

How is this even related? You stand firm and take the right decision and do not let anyone else wear that necklace. Hope you're able to keep it safe and away from your stepmother's reach", "Some people really make it their mission to ruin your happy day, don;t they?\n\nIt was a shitty request. And even if it wasn't, NO is a full sentence. Your evil stepmother is looking for ways to make you miserable when you should be happiest.

And what does she mean with \"uniting the two families?\" Her family and yours? Your spouses family and yours? It doesn't make too much sense. Especially the heirloom is from your family, not hers. Does she want to symbolize that you are her mom now and took over for your deceased mom? I don't quite get it.", "NTA - regardless of her intentions it\u2019s your necklace and you get to decide. It could be lovely but it could also be really weird. On your day you get to decide. All the best for the big day!", "You know that you wouldn\u2019t be getting the necklace back, right?\nNTA", "NTA this is an extraordinarily weird request.

If it was your MIL then I could see it but she's legally already 'family' by being married to your dad.", "NTA - you have every right to feel the way you do. I couldn\u2019t imagine letting my stepmother wear anything of my mothers. If I was a stepmother I would never dream of even asking.", "NTA the necklace is extremely precious to you.  However you decide what you want to do is right... if she wears it and it's damaged (not saying it would be, it is generations old though), it would be devestating, if you don't let her wear it, perhaps find something else that could be used instead.", "NTA - it's not hers to wear. She can honor your mom by just trying to be a decent person and respecting your decision. It's easy for other family members to say just let her wear it when it's not theirs. Stand firm and don't let them guilt you into something you don't want to do.", "NTA - What a tasteless idea.  It was not OK to suggest that so I think you handled it very well in just saying no.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't her necklace. It is your mother's family heirloom. If anyone should wear the necklace at the wedding, it's you. Also, this wedding isn't about displaying unity between your stepmother and mother. It is about you and your soon-to-be spouse.", "NTA.\n\n> She asked if she could wear my mother's necklace during the ceremony as a symbol of uniting the two families.\n\nI read that part, went wait a minute I thought this was for OP's wedding and had to double check that it was for your wedding.  Her request and reasoning for that request only makes sense if she had asked to wear it for *her wedding to your father.*  She just wants to wear the necklace and tried to come up with a plausible reason.\n\nYour wedding is about uniting *your* family with your spouse's, not uniting your family with your stepmother's family.  Your wedding is about you, not her.  The only person who should wear your mother's necklace on your wedding day is you.", "NTA - OP if you are not gonna wear the necklace, may I suggest you getting your florist to wrap it around your bouquet. Then after the ceremony is over give it to a trusted person - wedding planner, new mil, bridesmaid who won\u2019t be drinking anyone but stepmom - to hold onto after ceremony and return it the next day", "NTA. This is complete over-reach, and it can't be a gracious gesture from you when it's being demanded OF you. This is your mother we are talking about here\u2014you'd be so sad having someone completely unrelated to her wearing the necklace. It's sick, actually, that your father's wife is trying to manipulate this.", "She was not prepared to take \u201cno,\u201d for an answer which means she did not care about uniting the families. You\u2019re not overly possessive, you are being protective.  \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nUhhhh.... Overly possessive of something that has been passed shown through your family for generations? Its a family heirloom *passed down through the direct family bloodline* It's not a trinket to be loaned out to unrelated people for fancy occasions.\n\nYOUR wedding is not the place for your dads wife to wear as a symbol of uniting two families. That ship has sailed..... at her wedding. If she wanted to have this moment she should have commissioned pieces for the two of you then.\n\nYour wedding is for celebrating the joining of you and your spouses family, ONLY. The only jewelry that signifies that are your wedding bands.\n\nI think step mom has a little main character syndrome. I hope you wear the necklace at your wedding! \n\nCongrats!", ">She asked if she could wear my mother's necklace during the ceremony as a symbol of uniting the two families.\n\nI had to go back and check whose wedding we were talking about because stepmom's reasoning would have only made sense if it was for her wedding to OP's father.  It makes no sense for her to unite her family with OP's at *OP's wedding*.  This was an attempted attention grab."]}
