It was not OK to suggest that so I think you handled it very well in just saying no.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't her necklace. It is your mother's family heirloom.

Her request and reasoning for that request only makes sense if she had asked to wear it for *her wedding to your father.*  She just wants to wear the necklace and tried to come up with a plausible reason.\n\nYour wedding is about uniting *your* family with your spouse's, not uniting your family with your stepmother's family.

Its a family heirloom *passed down through the direct family bloodline* It's not a trinket to be loaned out to unrelated people for fancy occasions.\n\nYOUR wedding is not the place for your dads wife to wear as a symbol of uniting two families. That ship has sailed..... at her wedding. If she wanted to have this moment she should have commissioned pieces for the two of you then.\n\nYour wedding is for celebrating the joining of you and your spouses family, ONLY.

Your stepmother is out of order to even make such a suggestion and your Dad is an AH to side with her about it.
