That being said, I think a lot of people might feel uncomfortable having their stepmother wear their biological mothers things. I think that\u2019s a natural response. Most would wear the jewelry themselves, I think, but as that would be OP\u2019s choice, I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t want to. I *almost* give the stepmom an AH rating, even with this benefit of the doubt, for \u201cbeing visibly upset\u201d but that\u2019s not unexpected either; her suggestion was rejected and as it relates to her thinking of herself as a parent to OP, she\u2019s probably got to work through some personal feelings of rejection, even if they are unreasonable, from a purely logical, unemotional standpoint. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s making a huge deal about it now, rather other family members are. They may be stepping in based on her venting, but from OP\u2019s description, this could be coming from them without active pushing from stepmom and she\u2019s entitled to work through her feelings with family too. I think stepmom would show herself to best advantage if she not only clearly tells OP she accepts and respects the no, but also let\u2019s it be publicly known in the fam as well as working with OP to find another way to honor her late mother if/in a way that OP likes.", "Jewelry is very very special as you wear it so close to your body.

Oh hell no!  That\u2019s your something old.  That\u2019s a treasured moments!!  Diana has no rights to your necklace from your mother.  I thought it was Diana\u2019s wedding to your dad which would\u2019ve been an inch less weird.  \n\nNTA at all!  She has zero respect for you and your dad is not having your back.  Nope nope nope.", "Yeah...now I want to know what the brother (Alex) thinks about all this", "And hasn't commented on any of them.", "My bad. \ud83d\ude06", "Do NOT let her wear it. It\u2019s your mom\u2019s lineage, not hers and I guarantee she wouldn\u2019t give it BACK NTA", "Maybe there's something else she can wear that will hold the same symbolism.", "NTA...  It belonged to your mother & her wearing it to a wedding has nothing to do with uniting her family and your fathers.", "Uhhh NTA she asked, you declined, it\u2019s frankly weird and gross to insist", "Fuck that, she is not your mothers replacement. She is not standing in for your mother. Your step-mother is way out of line. Your Dad is an asshole for choosing her over you. His concern should be you on YOUR wedding day. She should stay home if she can't remember her place- your Dad's wife, NOT YOUR MOM.\n\nEdit - NTA", "NTA - but she and your dad are TA  for asking", "NTA. Though she is for asking, and so is your dad for taking her side. Do not let her wear that necklace, it'll be the last time you see it. If anyone is going to wear it, it should be you. You're who your mother left the necklace for. I hope this situation doesn't get in the way of you having an amazing wedding \u2764\ufe0f", "absolutely the fuck not the asshole here (NTA.) it is wildly inappropriate of your stepmother to ask you to wear your deceased bio-mom\u2019s jewelry, ESPECIALLY on *your* wedding day!!! i don\u2019t care if she thought it would \u201chonor\u201d your mother, she never met the woman and therefore has no idea how to honor her. this is big main character energy here. i kinda understand your dad wanting to keep the peace, but honestly any sane person would see this as grossly presumptuous and frankly disrespectful. he should\u2019ve had your back. it\u2019s not your job is facilitate her attempts at unifying the family, it\u2019s sure as hell not your job to do so on your wedding day!!! stand your ground, ignore the family members coming for you. you are 100% in the right here.", "NTA\n\nDiana has no tie to the necklace from YOUR MOTHER.  None at all.", "Nta. Wear the necklace yourself.", "In her head she must be thinking, \"Well, I already have the husband. What's the problem with the necklace?\" You said 'no.' Anyone trying to invalidate your feelings can talk to your back as you walk away. NTA", "Nta- you would never get it back and you know it .", "NTA What a weird way of marking her territory.", "The step momma's idea of unity is volunteering someone else's valuable property for her own use? Typically, the step momma would buy someone or gift something of her own to the bride, mother of the groom, etc. WTF is wrong with people?", "NTA And she has a lot of nerve to ask you for something like that. And how do you know she would return it after wearing it? Stick to your decision, and don't let anyone make you feel guilty about it.", "That necklace would have been \"lost\" somehow and forever in her possession thereafter.  It's your wedding, your necklace now, and you get to decide if anyone can borrow it or not.  NTA.  Diana needs to find another way to bond and show unity.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think she was terrible for asking but she should accept the refusal.", "NTA. Lock the necklace up somewhere or you are going to see her wearing it at the wedding whether she takes it or Dad gets it for her. People think it is easier to ask for forgiveness after the fact and that you won't say anything in front of people. So get the necklace put away.", "NTA and your stepmother has some nerve, even if you do get along", "NTA, make sure you keep an eye on the necklace. Normally when shenanigans like this happens, somebody ends up stealing. \n\nI assume the necklace was in the family for generations on your *mother's* side and not your father's.\n\nThere was no reason for her to think that it would be okay for her to wear that necklace or for her to ask about that necklace. She has no right I even consider asking. \n\nThe necklace was your mother's and given to *you*.\n\nMaybe you can wear your mother's necklace on your wedding day.", "The mere fact that she is stupid enough even ask\u2026\u2026.", "Or it could \u201caccidentally\u201d end up broken considering she\u2019s so fixated on it for some reason. NTA.", "Yeah, I call shenanigans", "What is weird is people actively counting how many posts people have.", "After I made my reply I went to see if they mentioned in a comment if they were a man or a woman since a woman would probably want to wear their mothers necklace but a man might want to have it with them but not wear as a necklace. That's when I noticed no replies but three separate AITA posts. Just strange.", "I usually go to the OP's profile to check for comment replies on the post, since there's often additional context. But having enough drama in your life to repeatedly post to this sub...that's a red flag if they're all real."]}
