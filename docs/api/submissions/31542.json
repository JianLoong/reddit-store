YTA", "YTA. You're too cheap and mean to buy your wife presents, and you're holding on a flimsier\u2014by\u2014the\u2014day excuse.\n\nYou get off on seeing her upset on her birthday, and other occasions.\n\nI hope she realises this isn't normal, and leaves you.", "Do you accept gifts she buys for you? If you do, YTA.", "I swtg men don't even like their wives. YTA.", "YTA She apologized for her atrocious behavior.  Are you going to forgive her or hold onto this forever?  \n\nThis behavior is extremely immature. You both need to grow up - you\u2019re married and have a child.  It\u2019s time to put pettiness behind you.", "ESH(?) It was rude of her to do that, but you seem to be holding a grudge even after she\u2019s apologized multiple times. I get her not liking the earrings, but there\u2019s a way of expressing dislike while being respectful. Instead of resolving the issue, you\u2019re holding it against her and taking it as an excuse to never gift her anything again. Just communicate honestly. Talk it out instead of being petty.", "YTA. Your years-long enjoyment of making her cry and repeatedly apologize without hope of forgiveness is truly sadistic, mean-spirited, and spiteful. Do you love her? It doesn't seem like you do. Just divorce her, pay child support, and let everyone move on from your extremely extended, years-long, deliberate cruelty.  The world will be a better place just from you not actively being cruel.", "YTA\n\nYour first attempt at a gift didn't go over well because you didn't know her taste in jewelry.  Her rejection of your gift hurt your feelings. I get it. But.... you are an ADULT.  You should have the ability to talk with your wife.\n\nYou obviously have access to the internet. Printed jewelry catalogs, store flyers, and library books exist.  Look at them with her.\nTake notes. If she doesn't like jewelry,  ask her what she does like. If you don't like the idea of making an effort to sit and find pictures of things she likes with her, just take her to a shopping mall and window shop with her until you feel you have a clue.\n\nIt only takes a tiny bit of effort on your part. The reason why she's upset is because you don't even try. I bet she buys birthday, anniversary, and Christmas(or other holiday) presents for you all the time. You don't care enough to buy her anything.\n\nYou tried once and gave up because your feelings were hurt, so in childish retaliation, you hurt her over and over again. \n\nIt's time to use your big boy words and calmly talk about your feelings with her. It's good practice communicating,  and you'll need the skill as your child grows up.", "YTA. WOW! You certainly hold a grudge. I get you were hurt ( and rightfully so) but since 2018?? Good grief. She\u2019s apologized. Get over it. You\u2019re acting childish and immature.", "So let me get this straight. She hurt your feelings once when she was still hormonal and apologized, and you find it acceptable to continue to let her suffer for years for one incident. Every holiday you let this continue she will become less invested in your relationship.  She will grow to resent you and will soon divorce you, and it will be too late to fix. When a woman is done, she is done. Let that incident go, stop emotionally abusing and tormenting your wife. Go buy her something \"she\" would like for Christmas.

Jewellery is not the be all end all of gifts. Why not anything else?", "YTA what kind of lesson are you teaching your kid 'better be good buddy, you have to react nicely to every present daddy gives you otherwise you won't get anymore even after you've apologised' it's giving weaponised incompetence 'i bought you the wrong jewellery, you didn't appreciate my effort, wear what jewellery i buy you obviously you aren't a person with independent tastes which i could have consulted you on, but no so now you're never getting a gift off me again' she apologised this isn't a grudge you should hold for so long", "ESH You gave your wife an expensive gift to express your emotions, and she rejected it and gave you a disgusted reaction which was ofc hurtful. It's completely understandable that you decided not to buy her gifts afterward. If this was a recurring issue, it would be worth discussing with your wife. If she didn\u2019t see the problem or tried to excuse her behavior, it's would be essential for you to reflect on this relationship.

She clearly wants a gift, does she give you gifts?

YTA! grow up.", "In future, Swarovski is just glass, not diamond. \n\nYTA for refusing to try at all after guessing her taste (why didn\u2019t you know what she would wear?) \n\nWhy isnt she worth any effort ever again?

It would be hard for me to get over too. \n\nHowever, you two need to talk this through, maybe marriage counseling because what\u2019s the endgame here? You are NEVER going to buy her a gift again? She continues to buy you gifts and what about your children? Exactly how do you plan on explaining that the reason mummy is crying is because you never by her gifts ad she made a mean mistake YEARS ago and you\u2019ve never forgiven her.

From another comment you wrote that you asked to get something for her and she said no and then later she came crying to you saying you didn\u2019t get anything for her. What is she, 5? You both need better communication and she needs to stop acting like you can read her mind and then having a tantrum when you can\u2019t.", "Nta at all", "WTF. ESH.\n\nJust because you give someone a gift doesn't mean that the other person must like it. Your wife's reaction was over the top and inappropriate. But to me it sounds like you didn't really make an effort to find out what your wife likes and then bought her something she didn't like and acting like it's her fault for not liking it.\n\nThat aside, your wife shouldn't lash out at you like that for buying something that wasn't her taste. She could return it anyways, so what's the issue other than you not knowing which kind of jewellery she likes? That doesn't warrant her language or reaction.\n\nBut come on, that's not a reason to act like a teenager. Just tell her that her reaction hurt and assure her that you're trying to get to know her better so you can choose appropriate gifts. Maybe go shopping WITH her instead of letting her go with lady friends and learn something about her while you're at it. And if that is not your alley, ask one of her friends what you can gift your wife.", "NAH.  If you feel better punishing her forever, ruining your marriage bit by bit, go for it.

Talk to each other and please remember the baby will pick up on your worrying vibes", "No, it isn't childish at all. Actions have consequences period. Maybe the wife will now know how to act appropriately and can teach her child appreciation and kindness. I don't know how you brought in that sharing my opinion equals winning an argument, making it more important than a healthy marriage. What a load of crap and a baseless assumption. The marriage didn't sound healthy to begin with due to the wife if you are bringing up Reddit mentality. I also mentioned that giving gifts where she could choose what she purchases \u201cgift card\u201d would be a good idea, including dinner, spa trip, etc. But I guess not everyone has boundaries right?", "Her reaction was super rude *but it was five years ago*.\n\nThe time for OP to nut up and get over it has long since passed.", "The gift was to celebrate the birth of a child.  How long postpartum was she?  Her hormones could have been still well out of whack.", "I don't think he is the asshole. Also, gift-giving is not mandatory in any relationship. It is a Westernized concept. The wife is acting spoiled because she hasn't gotten anything when she caused this due to immaturity. OP has also stated in his comments, that she wants \u201csurprises\u201d and that gift cards and gifts of that nature aren't enough for her. So then what is it? Because the last surprise she got she threw a temper tantrum.", "The last sentence in the first paragraph. They also went to the mall with another couple. She did this in front of everyone having a temper tantrum.", "Awwe you are so articulate! Thanks so much!", "Say What!!!!!", "Sure I guess so it is time to move on...", "No no I didn't say that, I just said that was the way I was brought up", "Sure", "Change. That's the point of therapy.. why'd you even make this post, your stance clearly isn't changing.. just wanted some attention?", "Therapy is very helpful. We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. A therapist can give you outside perspective and re-frame events and thought patterns for you. I went weekly for 3 years and it drastically changed my life. I had no idea my own internal thinking was so detached from reality. I\u2019m not saying you need to go for years (I had an undiagnosed mental illness), but it is definitely helpful. And a therapist could definitely help you with this situation. Help you understand why you have these feelings and can\u2019t forget it and help you understand your wife\u2019s point of view.", "Every single comment you post makes me think you need therapy", "You don't know how to let things go.   Things that hurt and humiliate you.   \n\nYou can learn  how to cope with other people's bad behavior without holding a grudge for five years.    \n\nYou're torturing your wife emotionally.   I can't believe she's stayed with you this long.   \n\n\nDo you understand your behavior affects your child, too?   They are learning how to treat other people  by the way the parents behave.   \n\nYou can change, but you have to want to and you have to make the effort to seek help.", "Punishing your wife for years of no gifts on birthdays/christmas holidays instead of communicating like a normal couple is just a bit worse than having a shitty reaction to a gift one time.", "Ok sorry, I took \u201cI come back\u201d to mean back home or something.", "(blush) I'm old, so I've had a lot of practice. So I hope this is somewhat helpful and helps you get less y t a answers in the future. We all mess up. Admitting it and trying to do better is how hubby & I are still together.", "I don't get your response. I gave you an easy fix that would allow you to surprise your wife with things she wants. Easy. No more tearful birthdays and holidays.", "It was time to move on 5 years ago...", "You're an adult. Stop blaming things on your childhood and make some actual change. You have said that she is making the effort for you, so you should do the same. \n\nWhat she probably actually wants from you is an indication that you pay attention to what she likes. Pay attention to the colours that she wears a lot/likes, the food that she always orders, the little comments she makes about some place looking like it would be fun/nice. Pay attention to whether she likes crime books and what her favourite authors are or what her favourite band is. That is how you be good at gifts, by paying fucking attention, that is what she wants from you. To pay enough attention to her that you could pick something out one or twice a year. It's not hard.", "I was raised by a violent man. Do you think I go around being the same?\nHe used to make us miserable and threaten us with no gifts for Christmas etc. He'd withdraw love if we didn't do what he told us. Do you think I do the sane or I've learnt? .\n\nDon't be the one who takes familial trauma to the next generation.", "No no, I want to change", "No! Don't apologize lol! Should OP get his wife gifts, yes!, but I would just do straight gift cards and flowers. A nice restaurant, hotel, or spa trip, wouldn't hurt. It's hard emotionally to come back from that behaviour, especially when your partner does that to you in front of others. Some would have also deemed it as emotionally abusive, and yes, I know that term gets thrown around a lot.", "Yes you did, I was just surprised when you said your husband keeps a diary seems a little too much for me tbh but if it works it works \n\nThanks for the fix, I will certainly attempt it", "You're not showing it. It was one incident years ago and suddenly she is undeserving of presents ? What if that was smth happening with Ur child ? U gifting them something and they talk before they think infront of others? \nYou are only showing your family that if they do one mistake they will get punished forever. That's what you need to talk about.\n\nI'm not sure if there is more going on maybe in your childhood or in your relationship. I started taking things my partner criticized at face face value and took it as behavioral guidelines/rules. Until he realized it and we had a long talk about how something might be an issue in 2019 but not today so taking the critique that literal and forever and being like \"but u once told me\" in an argument is like punishing him for things he once said. It is hard but I'm working on it. (Cause is past trauma)\n\nIf you realize that her behavior is a pattern towards you which is why you hold that much resentment or you are actually think of her as undeserving of gifts because of ongoing things. You will need couples therapy. Not to separate or bring out the worst but to actually be able to talk about it with a mediator.", "Aw I see. You could use your notes app in your phone. Or even the calendar function and put the list on the holiday date int he calendar. \n\nI also make sure I maintain my wishlist and mark things that I would want as gifts and things that are just for the house. Ask your wife to make a couple from her favorite stores that you can just easily access.", "Awwe, you are so structured in your thinking, thanks", "As a well-gifted person, I can tell you that mutual lists work! \u2764\ufe0f Maybe you two need the more structured and communicative approach to break out of the cycle you're in. Best of luck."]}
