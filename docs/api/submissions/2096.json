Our families were blended at a young age, so there\u2019s a natural sense of closeness growing up together in our family. At the time, I was expecting to be out of town for military training when I received an invitation. So I let her know well in advance that I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend. \n\nWhen the weekend of the wedding came, I had forgotten about the date of the event because I wasn\u2019t going anyway. It was also a long weekend where I was afforded a 4-day break from my training. I decided last minute to purchase a plane ticket and fly across the country to visit my girlfriend at the time. On the second day of my long weekend (the day of my little stepsister\u2019s wedding), my father called me to chit-chat about my training I had been doing. I let him know it was fun and challenging but stressful still. I also mentioned to him that I took advantage of the long weekend and flew back home.\n\nHe politely mentioned that it\u2019s my little sister\u2019s wedding today and that I had plenty of time to attend still. Looking at my watch, I had two hours before it started. It\u2019s also a two hour drive. Even if I dropped everything I was doing and immediately left, I\u2019d be late and stressed about the whole ordeal. I wanted to relax and clear my mind from the stress of training. I had just finished working out, I wasn\u2019t ready for the day, I hadn\u2019t prepared any decent clothes for the wedding, and simply put: I just wasn\u2019t willing to change my plans last minute for an event I wasn\u2019t planning on attending anyway. I told my dad I wasn\u2019t coming. \n\nSomewhere along the conversation with my dad, word got out I was back in the state. My littlest stepsister called and asked me to please come. I politely declined. I didn\u2019t give an excuse because I knew it wouldn\u2019t matter to her. So I didn\u2019t show up to my stepsister\u2019s wedding. I enjoyed the rest of my weekend, then flew back to my training and completed it successfully.\n\nYears later, if I had run into my sister and her husband at family gatherings up to this point, we were cordial and friendly. But nothing like how we used to call or text each other. When I was getting married (4 years later) I invited my entire family and had planned for my sister\u2019s little girl to be a flower girl for my own wedding. When my then fianc\u00e9 tried to reach out to my sister to see if she would like our niece to be part of the wedding, she was ignored. No returned calls or texts.\n\nMy stepmother informed me and my fianc\u00e9 that my stepsister is still upset about skipping her wedding years back. She suggested I apologize and make up. I was annoyed that she wasn\u2019t adult enough to vent her own grievances directly to me, instead completely ignoring my now wife. I found it childish and disrespectful. Being stubborn as I am, I refused to apologize and 3 more years after my own wedding, my stepsister and I haven spoken.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668231861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysxs6m/aita_stepsister_will_not_speak_to_me_years_after/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He didn't bother to show up at one of the most important events of her live. She realised that he isn't interested. He very literally doesn't care. And to this day he thinks she is petty and childish but doesn't get that she doesn't see him as family anymore. The \"now wife\" was a stranger to her. It is not ride to ignore a stranger wanting your kid as a flower girl. \n\n\nIt is super werid to ask a stranger to come to the wedding and give that strangers child a role in the wedding", "It is not disrespectful to not respond to a literal stranger (sister didn't knew the wife of op) to come to a wedding and bring your child.\n\n\nIt is super werid to invite a person you chose to not stay in contact with (or how else do you forget a wedding?) and not go to their wedding out of the blue.", "No, in the last paragraph is says he\u2019s stubborn and refused to apologise.\n\nBasically he knows he\u2019s TA.", "Take my \u2728broke\u2728 award \ud83c\udfc5", "Why have you put not the ass hole then list reasons why they are?", "The Dad called, the little step sister also called, he still didn't go or apologise.", "So OP shouldn't have gone to see his LDP at all?\n\nPeople in LDRs usually go and see thier partner on thier breaks.\n\nI'm not saying op doesn't suck but I'm saying your comment is bad. When does it stop being a booty call to you if GF isn't enough? Engaged? Married? Children?", "He could have done both.\n\nThe reality is, he ditched his sister\u2019s wedding to spend the break with his girlfriend. \n\nI think it\u2019s a bit unfair of the previous poster to call her a \u2018booty call\u2019, but I suspect they were using hyperbolic language to make a paint."]}
