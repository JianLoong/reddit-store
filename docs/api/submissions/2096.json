Our families were blended at a young age, so there\u2019s a natural sense of closeness growing up together in our family. At the time, I was expecting to be out of town for military training when I received an invitation. So I let her know well in advance that I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend. \n\nWhen the weekend of the wedding came, I had forgotten about the date of the event because I wasn\u2019t going anyway. It was also a long weekend where I was afforded a 4-day break from my training. I decided last minute to purchase a plane ticket and fly across the country to visit my girlfriend at the time. On the second day of my long weekend (the day of my little stepsister\u2019s wedding), my father called me to chit-chat about my training I had been doing. I let him know it was fun and challenging but stressful still. I also mentioned to him that I took advantage of the long weekend and flew back home.\n\nHe politely mentioned that it\u2019s my little sister\u2019s wedding today and that I had plenty of time to attend still. Looking at my watch, I had two hours before it started. It\u2019s also a two hour drive. Even if I dropped everything I was doing and immediately left, I\u2019d be late and stressed about the whole ordeal. I wanted to relax and clear my mind from the stress of training. I had just finished working out, I wasn\u2019t ready for the day, I hadn\u2019t prepared any decent clothes for the wedding, and simply put: I just wasn\u2019t willing to change my plans last minute for an event I wasn\u2019t planning on attending anyway. I told my dad I wasn\u2019t coming. \n\nSomewhere along the conversation with my dad, word got out I was back in the state. My littlest stepsister called and asked me to please come. I politely declined. I didn\u2019t give an excuse because I knew it wouldn\u2019t matter to her. So I didn\u2019t show up to my stepsister\u2019s wedding. I enjoyed the rest of my weekend, then flew back to my training and completed it successfully.\n\nYears later, if I had run into my sister and her husband at family gatherings up to this point, we were cordial and friendly. But nothing like how we used to call or text each other. When I was getting married (4 years later) I invited my entire family and had planned for my sister\u2019s little girl to be a flower girl for my own wedding. When my then fianc\u00e9 tried to reach out to my sister to see if she would like our niece to be part of the wedding, she was ignored. No returned calls or texts.\n\nMy stepmother informed me and my fianc\u00e9 that my stepsister is still upset about skipping her wedding years back. She suggested I apologize and make up. I was annoyed that she wasn\u2019t adult enough to vent her own grievances directly to me, instead completely ignoring my now wife. I found it childish and disrespectful. Being stubborn as I am, I refused to apologize and 3 more years after my own wedding, my stepsister and I haven spoken.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668231861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysxs6m/aita_stepsister_will_not_speak_to_me_years_after/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not ride to ignore a stranger wanting your kid as a flower girl. \n\n\nIt is super werid to ask a stranger to come to the wedding and give that strangers child a role in the wedding", "It is not disrespectful to not respond to a literal stranger (sister didn't knew the wife of op) to come to a wedding and bring your child.\n\n\nIt is super werid to invite a person you chose to not stay in contact with (or how else do you forget a wedding?) and not go to their wedding out of the blue.", "No, in the last paragraph is says he\u2019s stubborn and refused to apologise.\n\nBasically he knows he\u2019s TA.", "Take my \u2728broke\u2728 award \ud83c\udfc5", "Why have you put not the ass hole then list reasons why they are?", "The Dad called, the little step sister also called, he still didn't go or apologise.", "So OP shouldn't have gone to see his LDP at all?\n\nPeople in LDRs usually go and see thier partner on thier breaks.\n\nI'm not saying op doesn't suck but I'm saying your comment is bad. When does it stop being a booty call to you if GF isn't enough? Engaged? Married? Children?\n\nEdit: keep downvoting. I will always think it's shitty to reduce prioritising a partner to just a booty call", "He could have done both.\n\nThe reality is, he ditched his sister\u2019s wedding to spend the break with his girlfriend. \n\nI think it\u2019s a bit unfair of the previous poster to call her a \u2018booty call\u2019, but I suspect they were using hyperbolic language to make a paint.", "YTA - her life event was not a priority to you, sure fair enough. Your event isn\u2019t important to her, huge issue??\n\nYou set the pace and conditions on which this new relationship is built. You told her the value of her big life moments, and now she\u2019s not giving you that level of access to her life again. That\u2019s within her rights to do so. \n\nShe\u2019s not ignored you, be generally cordial, and not pitched any fits: so what do you want from her?\n\nYou can\u2019t treat her as barely an afterthought, then demand she show up for you in these same big situation?\n\nWhat made what she did different from what you did?? *(it\u2019s cool when they do it, it\u2019s a problem when I do it - your stepsister)*\n\nWhy does she owe you some loyalty that you don\u2019t owe her? Maybe she had plans, or maybe she simply didn\u2019t feel like coming, if that reason is valid for you why not her as well?", "YTA You became the AH the second you cared so little about your supposedly close little stepsister that you didn\u2019t even REMEMBER that it was her wedding!\n\nNot once! Not when you were booking those tickets and not even when your dad had to remind you during a phone call! So you didn\u2019t even plan to call her or text her to wish her all the best? What an AH!\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, you cared so little that you not only forgot the date of the wedding but you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to attend when you had the chance after all because \u201eyou were tired after working out\u201c. What? How selfish can anyone be. \n\nI would\u2019ve gone no contact with you after your behaviour. If anyone is immature, it\u2019s you.

If you actually were close or cared you would have known when her wedding was whether you were there or not. \n\nThis is 100% your making. And you refuse to apologize but are surprised when they can\u2019t be bothered with you anymore. Shocked pikachu face.", "YTA\n\nFrom what I can see you completely forgot about her wedding. Not only did you choose to not attend even the reception when you were reminded, you forgot about it entirely. Then you made the choise to rather stay with your GF. Between you both forgetting and then not coming I would be hurt as hell myself. Then it looks like you havent even apologized on top of everything?\n\nYou cant first hurt her feelings by forgetting, and then not attending, her wedding and not apologize cause its no big deal, then be mad at her for not attending yours. It cant both be that its stupid and she should just get over it, and also a grave enough offence for you to be angry at her for it.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't go to an important family event so you could chill at home and then surprised that you no longer have a relationship with her and surprised she doesn't want to go to your wedding. If your wedding is important to you, you can imagine her wedding was important to her.", "YTA", "Yta.  You still could have gone, two hours isn't a long drive.  You never apologized or explained and then wonder why your stepsister, that you actually refer to as your sister, has gone silent.  Not apologizing because of self-described stubborness is what also tops off the AH cake here.", "YTA. You forgot about you little sister's wedding and when reminded, decided it was more important for you to chill with your girlfriend. You clearly had little to no care for her. Why should she have any for you?", "YTA - starting with the fact that you forgot the date just because weren\u2019t going to be there. Even if you couldn\u2019t have made it, did you not plan to text her a congratulations, ask her how the prep was going, but her a present, talk to your family about it, ask for pictures, etc etc\u2026? \n\nYou were an asshole about your sister\u2019s wedding long before the weekend arrived, because if you cared about her at all, you would have remembered the date in the first place.", "YTA. no words needed.", "YTA. \nWhile your decision is understandable. She definitely deserves a good explanation and an apology.", "YTA - why do you think you should be awarded the courtesy you never bothered to extend. Karma is a bitch, ain\u2019t it?", "YTA, apologize and make up. Own the decision you made and acknowledge the fact that you hurt your little sister, stupid. All these years you got you lol sis hurting what a terrible big sis. Suck it up soldier and make it right.", "Info: do you really care?\n\nHonestly, do you ?\n\nIt\u2019s been 7 years. 7 since you had a relationship with your sister and nothing in you post says you miss her.  Nothing says I would like things to go back to the way they were. All I get is you wanting to be validated.  \n\nYour sister could have simply replied NO to your fianc\u00e9 when she messaged- after all she wasn\u2019t around when you hurt your sister.  However she does not owe you anything. \n\nYTA", "YTA- drop the sugar coating and say it how it is. You did not want to go to the wedding. That\u2019s it.\n\nYou didn\u2019t think to know the date to maybe, send them a wedding present? Or a best wishes text to your sister morning of?\n\nYou didn\u2019t know the date of your little sisters wedding was during a long weekend??? Which tells me you didn\u2019t even look at the date and try to see if you could work with it. \n \nYou\u2019re the asshole, and a self entitled one at that.

She's possibly right too\n\nYTA", "YTA Erm, so you treat your relative badly and then expect everything to be fine. That's quite self-absorbed. But I guess makes sense when the whole thing that started this was your lack of effort to even remember the weekend that a special family event was happening. This self-centred approach to your life fits with your lack of apology - you aren't being stubborn, you just have a huge ego and not enough time for others.", "YTA. You hurt her feelings and never apologized or offered an explanation, but are calling her childish and disrespectful. That\u2019s rich.", "Your self-absorption is truly impressive. YTA.", "You Sir are a big, gaping, selfish and entitled Ahole.\n\nYou most certainly are responsible to mske amends. She should keep ghosting you until you do.\n\nFunny how karma hurts.", "You couldn't be bothered to go to her wedding, but you think you get to be offended when she doesn't go to yours?\n\nAre you even hearing yourself right now?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You let your sister know how little she mattered to you by not even remembering the date of her wedding. How self centred are you? \n\nYou can think you're all righteous with your stance that she's not adult enough to approach you about her grievances. Not the point.  You messed up and you can either be a decent person; consider where you went wrong and apologize. or let this nonsense continue.", "YTA", "LOL such an AH", "You purposely missed your sisters wedding because it \u201cbe a hassle\u201d and you wanted to \u201cenjoy your weekend\u201d and you didn\u2019t think she\u2019d take that personally?\n\nWhat a selfish thing to do. \n\nAnd not only haven\u2019t you apologized in 4 years after missing it, somehow you believe she should\u2019ve been excited and been involved for your wedding, when you couldn\u2019t even have been bothered to go to hers? \n\nYTA", "YTA. It would have been a perfect weekend event to bring have your girlfriend fly in and go with you. Two birds with one stone. You blatantly disregarded her wedding and then got mad when she returned the favor.", "YTA say sorry and move in with life geez. It\u2019s it really so bad that she\u2019s hurt that her brother wasn\u2019t there? Esp when you could\u2019ve made it.

You shouldn't apologize.

So she is absolutely in the right to ignore you.", "YTA\n\nRelaxing with you GF was more important than being there on one of the most important days in your stepsister\u2019s life. She DID communicate - she told you how much she wanted you there. You made it extremely clear you didn\u2019t care by making no effort to attend.\n\nYou made it clear by not knowing when her wedding was - I can\u2019t believe \u201cthe date is coming up, I\u2019m so excited\u201d wasn\u2019t part of every communication for more than 6 months.\n\nYou only care about you.

Your sister is not the childish one here.", "YTA", "YTA you couldn\u2019t attend the wedding because you were in training, fair enough.

You didn\u2019t care enough to remember.", "Yep. He\u2019s 100% a self absorbed asshole.

Wouldn\u2019t he at least want to send his stepsister his good wishes the day before or something? \n\nAlso even when he could still make it, he only cared about himself.

He would rather be no contact with his step sister than admit his faults and try to rebuild their relationship.\n\nHe has a fragile ego that can\u2019t endure taking a step back. Apologizing is NOT hard and his inability to do so says a lot about him. He can\u2019t look beyond himself and can\u2019t understand other people\u2019s perspectives.", "He sounds like a spoilt brat. He made zero effort for her wedding then expects her to come running for his wedding. He is the one who permanently broke the relationship between them.", "Could have", "What gets me is, he didn\u2019t even consider doing -anything- for her wedding. Even if you simply cannot make it, you\u2019d still send a gift, give her a call the day before or whatever, record a video message for her for someone to play during the reception, things like that. You do *something* to make her feel that she\u2019s important to you, even though you can\u2019t be physically present. Apparently none of that even crossed his mind, otherwise there\u2019s no way he\u2019d have forgotten.", "He **forgot** about her wedding, there is nothing valid about it.", "Given how op is an AH, he wouldn't even have called and congratulated her for her wedding, or call in between. Did you not read the post properly?", "Those are all great points. And they all flow back to how do you forget a wedding of someone your supposed to be close to. I could understand a anniversary or something like that. But a wedding?", "Sarcasm dude", "Nope, he had canceled beforehand because of military training, then he got te weekend off", "Vote counting system will skip over your sarcasm.", "Yes, he did forget. It\u2019s literally in the OP. \n\nThat he initially wasn\u2019t able to make it doesn\u2019t excuse him from forgetting about it entirely. Even if you can\u2019t attend, you still do *something* to show that you care about them. OP apparently cares so little that even remembering when she was getting married was too much effort for him.", "He could have done both and brought his LDP along", "He could have taken his girlfriend with him and just surprised his sister. They didn\u2019t even had to have stayed long. I bet just a short pop up visit at the wedding would have been great for his sister.", "Fixed it", "Bot only cares about the top voted comment, no other really matters for the result.", "Exactly. Why does it have to be an either or?", "And the person I replied to didn't say that nor do we have any info the GF was even invited", "Did you read my reply?\n\nIt was a shitty comment saying its just a booty call they are in a relationship"]}
