Our families were blended at a young age, so there\u2019s a natural sense of closeness growing up together in our family. At the time, I was expecting to be out of town for military training when I received an invitation. So I let her know well in advance that I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend. \n\nWhen the weekend of the wedding came, I had forgotten about the date of the event because I wasn\u2019t going anyway. It was also a long weekend where I was afforded a 4-day break from my training. I decided last minute to purchase a plane ticket and fly across the country to visit my girlfriend at the time. On the second day of my long weekend (the day of my little stepsister\u2019s wedding), my father called me to chit-chat about my training I had been doing. I let him know it was fun and challenging but stressful still. I also mentioned to him that I took advantage of the long weekend and flew back home.\n\nHe politely mentioned that it\u2019s my little sister\u2019s wedding today and that I had plenty of time to attend still. Looking at my watch, I had two hours before it started. It\u2019s also a two hour drive. Even if I dropped everything I was doing and immediately left, I\u2019d be late and stressed about the whole ordeal. I wanted to relax and clear my mind from the stress of training. I had just finished working out, I wasn\u2019t ready for the day, I hadn\u2019t prepared any decent clothes for the wedding, and simply put: I just wasn\u2019t willing to change my plans last minute for an event I wasn\u2019t planning on attending anyway. I told my dad I wasn\u2019t coming. \n\nSomewhere along the conversation with my dad, word got out I was back in the state. My littlest stepsister called and asked me to please come. I politely declined. I didn\u2019t give an excuse because I knew it wouldn\u2019t matter to her. So I didn\u2019t show up to my stepsister\u2019s wedding. I enjoyed the rest of my weekend, then flew back to my training and completed it successfully.\n\nYears later, if I had run into my sister and her husband at family gatherings up to this point, we were cordial and friendly. But nothing like how we used to call or text each other. When I was getting married (4 years later) I invited my entire family and had planned for my sister\u2019s little girl to be a flower girl for my own wedding. When my then fianc\u00e9 tried to reach out to my sister to see if she would like our niece to be part of the wedding, she was ignored. No returned calls or texts.\n\nMy stepmother informed me and my fianc\u00e9 that my stepsister is still upset about skipping her wedding years back. She suggested I apologize and make up. I was annoyed that she wasn\u2019t adult enough to vent her own grievances directly to me, instead completely ignoring my now wife. I found it childish and disrespectful. Being stubborn as I am, I refused to apologize and 3 more years after my own wedding, my stepsister and I haven spoken.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668231861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysxs6m/aita_stepsister_will_not_speak_to_me_years_after/", "score": 543, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if you showed up at the reception, she probably would have been thrilled. I go further than that on a regular basis to go to a restaurant I like. Just admit she wasn\u2019t a priority. It\u2019s ok , but just man up and admit it . YTA", "Dude, YTA.  You were selfish AF and didn't go to her wedding because you didn't feel like it nor did you have the courtesy to tell her you weren't going or in town, but now that it's about you, you want her to drop everything?  \n\nJust BS on your part.  You got mad because she acted the way you did?", "YTA you don't care about your sister, you just want to use her daughter to make your own wedding look cute. Your sister is not childish, she's behaving in the way you showed her- like you're nothing to each other.", "YTA\n\nYou not only did not attend her wedding, you forgot the day it was happening. Whenever I am not able to attend an important family event I always call or text the person to let them know they\u2019re on my mind and wish them luck on the day. YTA For that alone.\n\nTo add on to that, you are now surprised that she has created distance between you after you hurt her? Why did you think that your niece would be in the wedding when you and them are clearly no longer close?\n\nFrom from step mothers comment, it\u2019s sounds like you\u2019ve never truly apologized or tried to make this right with your sister over the years, but SHES supposed to be the bigger person now that you\u2019re getting married? Come on man", "YTA OP", "YTA. You made a choice- you decided to prioritize relaxation over a super important milestone in your sister's life. In doing so, you showed her how very little you value her as family. You hurt her deeply and now that you've changed the dynamic of the relationship, she's decided to follow your lead. You have no right to expect her presence or participation in your wedding when you couldn't even be arsed to attempt to attend hers. If you don't like it, oh well. You burned the bridge all by yourself.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve very easily gone to her wedding, you chose to go see your girlfriend instead. \n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to you. So much so, that you didn\u2019t even care to remember the date so you could call in and tell her you love her, wish you could be there, etc. \n\nYou never apologized and just let it be when you knew the relationship was different. Overall, super selfish on your part and it\u2019s understandable why she doesn\u2019t want to have a relationship with you. We get it, you\u2019re the main character.", "YTA\n\nI mean\u2026what did you expect. You blew her off. You blew off her wedding. You bailed on something that was pretty important. All you wrote were excuses", "YTA. You didn\u2019t care at all about your step sister but now you expect her to care about you?", "YTA dude. Plain and simple. Weddings are one day in a lifetime. \n\nYou showed your sister how little you care about her. I wouldn't watsw my time with you either.", "YTA. Your in the same state within 2 hours from your sister wedding but can't be bothered over a  booty call. You made poor choice & hurt your family. I'd hate your gf & now if she is the wife too for not making you go. You're getting the treatment you deserve.  But with military training and now personality complex of superiority you still won't apologize even though you are 100% in the wrong to begin with. Now your on the receiving end of your model behavior and its passing you off. You reap what you sowed.", "YTA.  Of course you are.  You couldn't be bothered to attend your stepsister's wedding because you just didn't want to make the effort.  Boo hoo!  She doesn't want anything to do with you or your wedding and you are surprised?  As long as you want no relationship with your stepsister or her family, no apologies are needed.", "This is one of those situations where \"do you want to be right or do you want to be loved?\" applies. Pinning down who is TA here is so unimportant. What matters is that you could have gone to your sister's wedding and didn't, and then apparently you made no effort to apologize at the time, nor in the intervening years.\n\nStop worrying about who's right and who's wrong. Get in touch with your sister and apologize for missing her wedding, for letting your pride prevent you from apologizing at the time, for missing seven years of friendship and love and camaraderie with her. Ask her what it will take to mend things. \n\nMany many people have crappy families. If you had a good relationship with your sister prior to missing her wedding, be grateful for that and don't let it end because you're proud and stubborn. Fix it.\n\nYTA for not apologizing years ago.", "YTA a big one. You did not want to inconvenience yourself for HER wedding. You had all opportunity. But chose not to. \nHello. Welcome to adult life. Your choices have consequences, and yours cost you a relationship with your family member. \nBe adult and get over it.", "You had 4 days to \u201crelax and clear your mind\u201d. Even if you went to her wedding, you would have had 3.5 days. You could have showered, thrown on some clean clothes, and at least made the reception, even if you missed some or all of the ceremony. But the truth is, you just didn\u2019t care. You didn\u2019t care if you weren\u2019t there, and you didn\u2019t care if you hurt her. And you did. And now she knows. If you actually cared, you could try to unring that bell by sincerely apologizing, but you don\u2019t. YTA.", "She just probably doesn't want to be stressed with it, nothing wrong with that, right?", "YTA. You forgot about her wedding and when reminded you said you\u2019d rather just chill. That\u2019s not cool man.\n\nThat being said her skipping your wedding is also incredibly petty, but a but deserved", "You are the older brother who was in the military, that kind of makes you any younger sister's hero... And yet you didn't bother to show up....so yes she bears a grudge but YTA. Apologize.", "YTA. Not for not wanting to attend a wedding -- I try to avoid them when possible. But you twisted yourself in knots trying to make it appear to be impossible for you to attend.", "I hope her wound was healed enough that the salt of that text didn't cause pain and she just had a good laugh with her husband, who I assume you've never met?  YTA for missing the wedding when you clearly could have gone, giving poor excuses, not talking to your sister, then having the audacity to feel hurt when the same is done to you. I'm also gonna go out on a limb and say YTA for ignoring what everyone's saying and insisting to yourself that you're still right, you deserved to relax that weekend, and no one is understanding properly.", "YTA\n\nIt also sounds like she went *no contact* with you after the wedding. She was *polite* when she saw you at an event but nothing more. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d think she\u2019d show up at your wedding in the first place or allow her child to be used as a prop in your wedding.\n\nSM may want the two of you to repair your relationship but nothing suggests stepsister actually wants that (as suggested from her never reaching out and her just being polite whenever you run into each other).", "YTA\n\nThe audacity of you to expect her to make your wedding a priority for her and her family after making it *very* clear exactly where *she* falls on *your* list of priorities.", "YTA. OP should have driven the 2 hours to the reception. Then apologized for not dressing for the occasion. My guess is, little sis would have been thrilled no matter how you were dressed. She had a right to be peeved. Dick move.", "YTA you missed the wedding, it looked intentional, it probably was.", "YTA, you just don't care about her enough to even remember it's the day of her wedding so why should she care about you enough to answer your wife's messages? you wanted to be distant strangers, now you are. where's the question coming from?", "YTA. You should work on being less selfish and admitting when you are wrong.", "YTA. It\u2019s terrifying to me that you are in the military with this level of immaturity. Grow up, man.", "YTA\n\nYou forgot her wedding, \u201cpolitely declined\u201d to your dad but did not apologize to your sister. You didn\u2019t feel like going. But then expected her girl to be your flower girl and attend and now you\u2019re mad she didn\u2019t go and is still upset? No emotional intelligence here?", "The fact that you need to ask, YTA and without a hint of awareness", "YTA. You only care about yourself.", "Do I need to say it? \n\nYTA OP.", "YTA - the fact you didn\u2019t think you could make it aside, you just straight up forgot the wedding date of someone who supposedly meant a lot to you \n\nThe fact you didn\u2019t go is bad enough on its own, but you straight up forgot", "Lol my dude YTA. What makes your wife so special to your sister that you\u2019re offended she ignored her messages. Heck her own bro ignored her wedding. What an ego you have.", "INFO: why did you not apologise to your sister for not being able to attend the wedding? Or better yet, why did you forget such an important day for your sister to drop her a message at least if you hadn\u2019t had the break? Why are you upset that she doesn\u2019t want her/ her child to attend the wedding. Do you think your wedding is more important than hers?", "YTA", "YTA. You refused to make a bit of effort and now you\u2019re reaping the results of your actions.", "YTA\n\n> It was also a long weekend where I was afforded a 4-day break from my training\n\nYou could have easily made it, you just didn't care.\n\nSo why should your family care about you?", "YTA. If my sibling had to call me to personally ask me to come to their wedding I'd move the heavens and the earth to get there, even if I was tired. It was a big day for her and you showed that you'd rather go see your GF than be there for her. You could've split your time between the 2 or seen your gf at another time (assuming you had a healthy relationship with her) or even taken her as your +1 if possible.", "YTA\n\nYou had the time off, and decided that your stepsister was not important, not even a secondary consideration.  So why are you so upset that she is treating you the exact same way, not even considering you important or even a secondary consideration?  \n\nUnless you are like that one way street, not even compromising and still are upset that your sister decided you are not all that, and a bag of chips.\n\nVery much YTA", "Who forgets the date of their sister's wedding?? I hope you girlfriend you went to visit is the same person who is now your wife. If not... Ooof!\n\nAnd yes, YTA big time", "Obviously YTA, it was your sisters wedding and didn\u2019t even remember the date? And then you refused to go because it was inconvenient after you should have prioritized it in the first place! Why are you so self-absorbed?", "NTA. y'all i want you to gender flip this:\n\"i (female) missed my stepbrothers wedding bc of military training. i forgot the date as i didnt think i would be there anyway and happened to be in town the day of due to an impromptu long weekend. so i didnt have proper attire and didnt want to show up under-dressed and in a less than relaxed head space when i was told. years later when i was to get married, he didnt bother telling me himself he was still upset i had missed his wedding, he made his mother tell me for him instead. now neither of us have spoken in 3 years since my wedding.\"\n\ni know for a FACT so many of y'all would sit here saying \"the stepbrother is a momma's boy and AH for not just talking it out with OP\" if he was a woman. \n\nOP, you are not an AH for not wanting to attend something you werent even prepared for. your Step-sister is a brat.", "Who forgets their siblings wedding? And then when you're reminded about it you said you just wanted to relax. That alone makes YTA \n\nAll of your behavior after that, from not apologizing to blaming her for holding a grudge, is all just building up on that solid foundation of assholery you laid.", "ESH, your sister not talking to you and you refusing to apologize. Be a bigger man talk to her.", "YTA because you didn\u2019t step up as the older sibling and apologize. Life is too short to be this petty. \n\nYou\u2019re N.T.A for forgetting her wedding or wanting to rest after training and a cross country trip! There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d hate more than to have to be at a big event with extended family up my ass asking questions during my short break. But did you send a gift? A card explaining the situation or an invitation to dinner to celebrate with the happy couple? Did you do ANYTHING to acknowledge that your little sister was getting married/had gotten married? No? Than YTA", ">You forgot it was her wedding\n\nThat's what he said. This proofs he doesn't care at all for his sis. Or maybe he's lying, he didn't forget it which, again, also proofs his sis means absolutely nothing to him.", "I call total bullshit.  He\u2019s telling us he flew across country for a long weekend near his family and didn\u2019t call his dad in advance to say he\u2019ll be nearby.  Also He\u2019s literally trying to tell us his dad by pure chance called him two hours before the wedding to chit chat about his training and that\u2019s when he found out the wedding was two hours away?  No way the dad as father of the bride would be calling ANYone to chit chat two hours beforehand.  If OP would supposedly confess to dad ha hey I\u2019m actually in town, then OP would have called days earlier to say he WOULD be in town", "Big, bad military man can't handle the emotional vulnerability of a simple apology. Fucking classic.", "Oh for sure. I was like kind of following him a little bit until he was all mad that she was hurt and disappointed and is all now she isn\u2019t texting me. Um of course she isn\u2019t going out of her way to see you now, you really hurt her feelings. He didn\u2019t have to attend but it sure showed his priorities.", "It's not even that he didn't care enough to go. He didn't remember at all. He cared so little for his sister that he didn't think to *call with good wishes* on one of her most important days. Then he's all surprised and butt hurt that they're not as close as they used to be. Dude, how big an AH can you be?", "He used a whole lot of words to talk about how important and stressful his life was. Can't use just a few words to apologize. Totally self consumed AH.", "Also note how when he was referring to her wedding she was \u201clittle stepsister\u201d but when referring to his wedding she was \u201csister\u201d.", "Sounds like the main reason he even thought of his sister for his wedding was because he wanted her daughter to be the flower girl. I bet he doesn\u2019t have a relationship with his niece because of everything. And he couldn\u2019t even contact her himself, he was setting up his fianc\u00e9e to fail.", "Maybe dad called him to try to get OP to say a few nice words to the bride on her wedding day (or to remind him to call/text her) and was warming up to when he spilled the news that he was nearby.", "Stepsisters knew already that he is an AH, before her wedding.  I doubt they had a good relationship earlier. He is so full of BS. \n\nI would stay away from him too. \nYTA", "My cousin did exactly this. He was in the military and RSVPd that he had no idea if he\u2019d be able to attend but probably not. I told him he had a standing invitation if he found himself free, that dinner was buffet and it wouldn\u2019t impact things negatively if he came in late. Sure enough he pops in halfway through my reception when last I heard he was in a different state. It was awesome.", "The guy makes it through military basic and training to say driving two hours and picking out clothes for a wedding is too stressful lol", ">He didn't remember at all.\n\nI'm not buying that for a second.\n\nHe mentions they're a close family, he routinely takes a phone call from his father, and an entire wedding preparation **from his own sister:** he simply failed to notice? That's the stuff that people talk about for months!\n\nHe just couldn't be arsed, that's all.", "He doesn't care...until it makes him look bad. I'm sure he was asked why his sister wasn't at his own wedding. \n\nThis guy is general material for the army, completely convinced of his own superiority and correctness and anyone who doesn't agree can just be dismissed from sight and mind.", "Rudolf Hess edited Mein Kampf. That means he was the original Grammar Nazi. You are just an annoying pedant.", "Did you read mine?\n\nI said between invite and the wedding not post wedding until now.", "lol I wonder if he told his stepsister one of the reasons he couldn\u2019t make it was because he had just gone to the gym. To really drive home how little he cared.", "Nah, he cared enough at least to post this on YTA. So not a general, but I'd say he certainly qualifies for major. \n\nMajor Asshole."]}
