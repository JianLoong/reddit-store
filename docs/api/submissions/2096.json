{"id": 2096, "submission_id": "ysxs6m", "title": "AITA- Stepsister will not speak to me years after not attending her wedding", "selftext": "I was invited to attend my little stepsister\u2019s wedding a few years back. Our families were blended at a young age, so there\u2019s a natural sense of closeness growing up together in our family. At the time, I was expecting to be out of town for military training when I received an invitation. So I let her know well in advance that I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend. \n\nWhen the weekend of the wedding came, I had forgotten about the date of the event because I wasn\u2019t going anyway. It was also a long weekend where I was afforded a 4-day break from my training. I decided last minute to purchase a plane ticket and fly across the country to visit my girlfriend at the time. On the second day of my long weekend (the day of my little stepsister\u2019s wedding), my father called me to chit-chat about my training I had been doing. I let him know it was fun and challenging but stressful still. I also mentioned to him that I took advantage of the long weekend and flew back home.\n\nHe politely mentioned that it\u2019s my little sister\u2019s wedding today and that I had plenty of time to attend still. Looking at my watch, I had two hours before it started. It\u2019s also a two hour drive. Even if I dropped everything I was doing and immediately left, I\u2019d be late and stressed about the whole ordeal. I wanted to relax and clear my mind from the stress of training. I had just finished working out, I wasn\u2019t ready for the day, I hadn\u2019t prepared any decent clothes for the wedding, and simply put: I just wasn\u2019t willing to change my plans last minute for an event I wasn\u2019t planning on attending anyway. I told my dad I wasn\u2019t coming. \n\nSomewhere along the conversation with my dad, word got out I was back in the state. My littlest stepsister called and asked me to please come. I politely declined. I didn\u2019t give an excuse because I knew it wouldn\u2019t matter to her. So I didn\u2019t show up to my stepsister\u2019s wedding. I enjoyed the rest of my weekend, then flew back to my training and completed it successfully.\n\nYears later, if I had run into my sister and her husband at family gatherings up to this point, we were cordial and friendly. But nothing like how we used to call or text each other. When I was getting married (4 years later) I invited my entire family and had planned for my sister\u2019s little girl to be a flower girl for my own wedding. When my then fianc\u00e9 tried to reach out to my sister to see if she would like our niece to be part of the wedding, she was ignored. No returned calls or texts.\n\nMy stepmother informed me and my fianc\u00e9 that my stepsister is still upset about skipping her wedding years back. She suggested I apologize and make up. I was annoyed that she wasn\u2019t adult enough to vent her own grievances directly to me, instead completely ignoring my now wife. I found it childish and disrespectful. Being stubborn as I am, I refused to apologize and 3 more years after my own wedding, my stepsister and I haven spoken.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT 1: I am content with the general consensus as TA. But there seems to be confusion as to why I\u2019m upset at my sister. I\u2019ll clarify\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t expect her to attend my wedding when I asked (which we didn\u2019t have a formal ceremony anyway because of the COVID nonsense). Especially since I skipped hers for my own mental maintenance. I can live with reaping what I\u2019ve sewed. I did however, expect my sister to respond to my now-wife\u2019s invitation of her daughter as a flower girl. Even if she declined. Not acknowledging communication is rude. My wife had nothing to with any of my decisions before this.", "created_utc": 1668231861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysxs6m/aita_stepsister_will_not_speak_to_me_years_after/", "score": 2628, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm going to go against the grain a little bit and say that the actual act of skipping the wedding isn't as irredeemable as some are making it out to be. The mention of \"training\" makes me think you were pretty young at the time (since lots of people enlist right out of high school). You definitely wouldn't be the first 18-20ish year old to make a very self-centered choice without considering the other side's feelings until it was too late. It was wrong and selfish to be sure, but you could have learned from it and moved forward in a non-AH way.\n\nWhere you *really, really* become the AH, in the there's-no-coming-back-from-this sense, is by not owning up to what you did and the hurt you caused.\n\nYou're trying to act like you didn't know there was an issue until your step-mother mentioned it, but come on - the fact that she stopped calling and texting after the wedding made it very obvious that she was upset. You had YEARS to bring it up. Did you not miss her enough to ask why she was so distant?\n\nAnd even when it finally impacted you in a concrete way, even when you were hit in the face with it at your own wedding, you STILL couldn't be bothered to apologize and try to make it right. It's been years since then! What exactly are you gaining by holding out? Will you really be on your death bed thinking \"wow, I'm so glad I never apologized to my sister!\"?\n\nWe all make mistakes, especially when we're young. This was a BIG one, but it didn't have to be the end of the relationship. Your sister loved you and probably would have forgiven you if you'd made an effort to clear the air with her.

I'm surprised any of them still talk to you.", "OP YTA, how did it feel to you when she didn't attend your wedding? Bc I bet she, her husband, and y'alls family felt the same way y'all did.

That's not cool dude , she told you in advance and you \"forgot her wedding\" that's a load of B.S, something that important you can't forget it. You forgot a whole ass wedding, with your family and family that doesn't live close to you would probably be coming in????\n\nAlso, for the fact that YOU STILL ATTACKED HER AFTER YOU NOT CALLING HER AFTER HER WEDDING/HONEYMOON TO APOLOGIES!!!! Your telling me that she's childish for still having a grievance about you not attending, but you feel the exact same way she does so that would make you childish.

Did you make an effort to show her how much she meant to you and that you wanted to celebrate with them even though you weren't there on that day? We had friends - not family - that didn't make it and they took us out for dinner and made efforts to show us this. And we weren't even upset at all that they couldn't be there.\n\nBy your own admission you never even apologized nor explained to her what happened. And it's been years. That you let it go even months would be unacceptable.", "YTA - even if you couldn\u2019t be bothered to go which you could\u2019ve of easily made the reception could\u2019ve called/texted something like this \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be at your wedding but I hope it\u2019s a beautiful wedding and an amazing day for you\u201d took me all of 5-10 seconds to write that - you definitely owe her an apology for so many reasons", "YTA. The truth is you didn't give a shit about your sister's most important day. You were so wrapped up in yourself. Now she's returning the same level of effort you are too dense to make that connection until being told by your stepmom. You are either dense or self absorbed.", "Agree but sadly he didn\u2019t even give her an excuse he just declined to go because according to him if he gave her an excuse she wouldn\u2019t buy it", "Yeah, he totally could have salvaged forgetting her wedding by just rushing there. And if his sister has humor he could totally have owned fucking up and forgetting the wedding and made it into a good story and a great memory. Then he would just have been an idiot but an idiot who cares about his sister.", "the audacity of OP saying she \"wasn't adult enough to vent\" when OP wasn't adult enough to show up to his (in his own words describing his family's relationship), \" close\" stepsister's wedding with the reasoning of \"ion fweel like it, I'm tired\"", "He also changes from step sister to sister throughout. I\u2019d be upset if my sibling chose to not attend my wedding even when they had the opportunity to do so.", "No one likes an arrogant self-centered A H.", "This is correct. You shower, jump in the car, and show up to the reception.", "This.  My dad often calls me to remind me of relatives' birthdays and other events \"in case I want to give them a call.\"  Even if OP wasn't going to be at her wedding, as her brother, he should have at least called her the day before or morning of to give her his love and best wishes.  The fact that he didn't would probably trigger a call from dad.", "Yeah and dad has plenty of spare time to just call son on wedding day (unless he had intelligence that son was in town). This post does seem far fetched. But regardless, I call YTA", "Maybe he was there when 'the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor'? lol", "INFO: If she declined the invitation why  would you think she would you let you use her daughter as a prop?", "You just can't stop being an asshole. You gave up the right to have any expectations when it came to your sister. Don't breed. Seriously. Your mental health maintenance. LMAO Wow. They have really lowered standards in the armed forces. ROFL", "NTA", "He wasn't going anyway?", "And he was not planning on sending a GIFT to his sister for her marriage?", "I can totally see myself forgetting a date like that. But what I would **not** do is to skip the wedding. I would hop into a car and drive. Will I be 15-30 minutes late? Sure. Will I be stressed? Sure. But I am certain my sister would want me there and that she would forgive me for forgetting as long as I do my best to fix my fuckup. On the other hand if I just skip she would probably not forgive me for a long time if ever.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t buy that they were nearly as close as OP wants people to think. You don\u2019t cut someone out of your life just because. No, I think the disappointment was building up over many years for little sister and this was just the icing on the cake. \n\nOp, YTA.", "So I just saw his updates and he had his fianc\u00e9 call to ask about this niece being the flower girl NOT him but his fianc\u00e9 really????

Come man what did you expect", "My husband is in the military (active duty) and was stationed overseas and still managed to be there for his sisters wedding\u2026 he took a hopper from Japan to Hawaii then Hawaii to California then to North Carolina. THREE days after he got back from a 6 month sea deployment. \nIt\u2019s not the fact training was stressful, you wanted to get laid more than you wanted to go to your step sisters wedding. Just say that. You could\u2019ve asked if they had any clothes for you and driven there, you honestly probably knew it was her wedding day, but don\u2019t want to tell that part to seem like a huge AH. \nOp YTA.", "YTA, and if you're THAT piss-poor at planning, you should never make it above PV2. You should also probably go active rather than weekend reservist, because you aren't functional with that level of planning, nor with that level of refusing accountability. You need someone to dictate to you what you must do, when you must do it, and what you must wear to it. Also probably need to provide you transportation. \n\nI was in Iraq in the early 2000s. We had one phone and 2 computers for 1100 soldiers. I STILL managed to get presents sent to my parents and my kids for their birthdays, AND hire www.hireasanta.com for my kids. (Turned out Santa was a former sniper and said he had 11confirmed kills; he happened to be there when I was able to call again. I hope my kids weren't sitting on his lap to hear that). \n\nKeeping track of dates was really difficult, and mostly useless. We did it anyway. You failed and you were still CONUS. This is on you, Private. Beat your face til I get tired.", "You didn't bother to remember when the wedding date was to see if you could try to work it out with your training. Couldn't be arsed to hop in the car and try to make it that day. And then further can't be bothered to freaking apologize for it.\n\nFurther you wanted her kid to be in the wedding but didn't expect her to show up for it.\n\nBut sure you cared about her and care about her family.\n\nRight...\n\nOkay\n\nYTA\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nAnd the part about willing to reap what you sow but also expecting her to answer the phone for your wife. Part of reaping what you sow is that your wife and your future children are also going to suffer for your selfishness. Why should she answer your wife's call? She's done with you and that includes your wife.", "My dude, your edit does not help your case. Your stepsister was not rude to ignore your request to use her daughter as a prop in your wedding.", "I say NAH. My husband is military, I know how draining training can be. I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to spend that long weekend relaxing rather than at a wedding. And I don\u2019t blame you for not remembering it was the wedding because of how stressful and demanding training, and being in the military in general, can be. Just say good riddance to her.

Bet it was just a booty call. Major AH.", "Agreed. If he cares so little for the sister and the relationship that he can\u2019t make the minimal effort to apologize, looks like sis is not missing anything in her life. OPs whole post shows how little he values her. YTA", "Nah, he probably forgot. I do not see any reason why OP would lie about this. On the other hand it is unclear why he did not plan to do a congratulations text which should mean that he should have added it to his calendar.", "For real. If they were as close as he claims they used to be, one would expect him to still send a gift, make sure a card is in the mail, and then at least call or text her day or to wish her well and express how much he wished he could be there. He doesn\u2019t give a shit about her. He only cares now because she didn\u2019t call back his wife\u2014 who also presumably has no relationship with his sister\u2014 after the gauche request for their daughter to play flower girl.", "Take a nap and then fire ze missiles!!", "He is mad she didn't RSVP to him when he never RSVPed to her. He is mad she didn't reach out and talk to his fiancee (who never spoke to her about the daughter being a flower girl directly), when he hasn't spoken to her in 3 years directly.\n\nFucking double standard and hypocrite.", "1) He didn\u2019t realize the wedding actually went on after the two hours it would take to drive there. \n2) his sister has a child, I imagine she\u2019s looking forward to a weekend relaxing just as much as he was looking forward to his shower after training \ud83d\ude44", "Yup, it\u2019s to downplay how his lack of involvement in her wedding shouldn\u2019t have matter as though he is a distant relative and to play up how her lack of involvement is super bad because she is such a close relative. It\u2019s intentional wordplay to make him look better.", "Right? Just something to show hey sorry I missed your big day. Anything. I understand training being tough but like the bare minimum would have saved a lot of grief.
