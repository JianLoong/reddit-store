Also, Koda says she lost all of her friends because of him\u2026 This is abuse. Look up coercive control. \n\nI was in a relationship where coercive control was one aspect of it (very complicated story but it was a DV relationship) and I didn\u2019t realise what he was doing at first. Over the first few months, he acted like the greatest guy. But as time went on, he isolated me from friends and family, made me dependent on him for everything. He wouldn\u2019t let me have a job. It only went downhill from there. So trust me when I say that Koda is better off severing any contact with  Sam. And you should too. Block him, block his friends, help her in whatever it takes to stay away from him and to move on. She\u2019ll thank you in the long run. A little distance will help put things into perspective for her. She needs to run now before it\u2019s too late. \n\nI don\u2019t know the exact stats, but I heard it takes women around half a dozen attempts to leave a DV relationship. It took me twice that many. So believe me when I say the sooner Koda sees this for what it truly is, the better.", "NTA and Koda needs to leave. There is nothing ok about that guy. Not one thing. And she's old enough to know that.", ">Koda says im right for what I did because she lost contact with all of her friends because of him .\n\nThat's the most important sentence in the story.  Block all his friends - she doesn't answer to them- and ask her if she wants help ending this relationship. Have her take a look at this...\n\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/resources/types-of-abuse/", "Nta. He sounds like a controlling prick and that never ends well. Keep your friend far away.", "NTA. I'm sure there is a lot of information missing because relationships are complicated, but what you've described is textbook abuse and she needs to stay away from him", ">Koda says im right for what I did because she lost contact with all of her friends because of him\n\nYk what one of the first things in an abuser's guide is?

In every way.", "NTA, do you really need us to tell you that? He's a controlling, abusive jerk and you friend in better off without him. He has no right to give you, your friend, or anyone orders. Block him and his friends who obviously are living in the dark ages and view women as property, you don't need people like that in your life", "NTA\n\nYou just saved your best friend from her abuser. You will never be the asshole for doing that. His friends are also assholes for telling you to \u2018follow orders\u2019 - block every one of those toxic mofos. Keep your friend safe - you did good.", "NTA. Koda needs to drop this AH. His verbal abuse and controlling ways are red flags and that will never lessen, it will only get worse. This is domestic violence at the start with verbal abuse. The fact that his friends are reaching out to justify his actions is confirming of a bad situation in the making.

Telling you you have \u2018no right\u2019 to see her again?? You may have just saved Koda from the hell of an abusive relationship under a controlling narcissist.

You did the absolutely right thing in standing up to him and taking Koda away and keeping her safe. You did NOT overstep! Sam is a super-duper controlling AH. Eff his friends! They are AHs too, especially if they treat their GFs the same way as he does.\n\nSam is not a nice guy. He is friendly and charming when he needs to be. But when he gets angry, his real feelings come out. What you saw and dealt with is the real Sam. He showed you who he is. Believe him the first time. Save yourself the misery of ever expecting better from him.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great that Koda wanted to come with you and get away from him. She told you you did the right thing! Listen to her! She realizes that this relationship has negatively affected her life. They have been dating a year, and he has already isolated her from many of her friends. If they stayed together, he would do everything possible to turn Koda against you.\n\nI hope you and Koda stay strong for each other. Trust your instincts. You did great your friend a great service!", "Guy court convened.  \n\nThe court finds this constitutes a dick move on his part.  \n\nI will go as far as saying that i suspect he's not even opened his how to be a guy manual.  \n\nThis is poorly implemented controlling behavior.  I'm embarrassed all many levels.  \n\nNot that I've read it ... but i suspect that if you review your girl code manual, there's probably a section in there related to how to develop the underdeveloped male.  You should see it titled \"Girl, just accept that men mature slower than women\"  hypothetically of course.  \n\nBest of luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
