We shared the first box but she didn't want to share the 1L tub that she bought saying that it was only for her. \n\nI was disappointed by this because I want to have some too and I've always shared everything I've bought with her. TBH I felt like she was being stingy especially because it was over a tub of ice cream. \n\nFast forward to today, I was chilling at home and I was craving some ice cream. I open up the fridge and there it is - her 1L tub of cookies and cream. For the record, it was already opened and I only had a couple of spoons of it.\n\nFast forward again, I'm on the phone with her and I tell her cheekily that I had some, thinking it won't be such a big deal. She proceeded to get mad at me and tells me that I crossed a boundary. I was a bit shocked because it's just some ice cream and countless times I've shared my food with her and have made multiple meals for her at my expense.\n\nThe 3 spoons of ice cream led to her getting upset enough to start a full-blown argument about it. I just don't understand what's the issue, I've even offered to buy her another tub but she's still upset that I had some from the one that she bought. It all seems a bit petty to me. Am I the asshole? Or is she being petty?\n\n\nTL:DR Girlfriend bought some ice cream for herself and I ate a small amount. She got upset because I crossed a boundary but I feel like it's all a bit petty and that she's being a bit stingy considering I've treated her really well (random gifts, lots of paid for dates). I've also shared all my food that I've bought and never told her she couldn't have something.\n\n\nEdit - I understand no means no and I've apologised to her for not asking. I still think it was petty to get upset over this, to me this would not have been a thing to get upset over. Finally I'm not evil and I didn't do this on purpose. If I had known it meant so much to her I wouldn't have done it in the first place.\n\nEdit 2 - I probs need to take these small requests more seriously and explicitly ask, not make assumptions.

Reddit really hates men \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 anyways.\n\n\nESH. I truly don\u2019t understand why anyone would be upset over ice cream but ya know everyone has their own battles. \n\nYeah you shouldn\u2019t have gone and grab some ice cream after she said not to but she\u2019s also wrong for just leaving it at YOUR place. If someone brought over pizza to my place and said sorry you can\u2019t have any but I\u2019m gonna leave at your house? You bet your ass I\u2019m grabbing some pizza and enjoying it. \n\nThe assumptions here about you are so far off. You can just judge a whole relationship based on this. It\u2019s ridiculous \ud83d\ude02  just be more proactive in listening to what she\u2019s saying. I know it\u2019s a little thing but it helps in every way. Apologize and just move on.

If this is the worst thing that has happened in their relationship, she has lead a very charmed life! Maybe he did do it intentionally because he was upset that she didn't want to share with him. But who goes out to get treats and buys something only for themselves when they are at someone else's house?", "NTA\n\nPeople are being overly sensitive about this in these comments.\nShe set a boundary, yes, but it's ice cream, come on.\nIm wondering if she would've reacted the same, had you eaten the whole thing and replaced it.\nIts your home, its your freezer, she needs to be rational about it or take her stuff back to her own place and her own freezer, end of story. \n\nI see people drawing lines to the conclusion that you probably disregard her boundaries all the time, making assumptions for no reason. \nIgnore those, they're probably teens with just the pocket money they get from mom and dad.\n\nLike a couple others have said, if that's how she reacts or a couple spoonfuls of ice cream, how is she going to react to significant things? \nBig red flag in my book.", "NTA.

But it's also ice cream: there are dozens of identical containers for sale everywhere. \n\nSo it's not like she was really looking forward to her leftovers from a meal, and it's not something that isn't easily replaced with the exact same thing. So from what I've been told so far it shouldn't be a big deal. But... \n\nINFO: Do you regularly disregard her stated wishes?", "YTA - she asked you to not eat her ice cream.

What's the point in leaving it there? \n\nThat being said, she did say not to eat it and you went ahead and did it anyway. And while it's over something ridiculous (in my opinion), she was obviously upset you didn't listen to her. She might be thinking if you ignore what she says about something small like this, what else will you do it about. It's setting a tone that you'll do what you want regardless of what she says. \n\nI do want to say though that if something like ice cream is enough to cause a full blown argument, you both might want to rethink your relationship or talk about boundaries. You both seem on complete opposite ends with this kind of thing and it's only going to cause more issues in the future.", "NTA.  She is unreasonable and it's not about boundaries. It is selfish and controlling behavior.  Imagine what fights about something significant would be like.", "NTA. Without some explanation of WHY this carton belonged only to her, the request does not make sense. I would apologize, because strange as her request was, she made a clear request.

You ate a bit of the ice cream she left at your freezer, you didn't sell her life saving medicine. If it was a test of trust, it was a stupid one. For all I am concerned, if you had eaten all of it, you should have provided a new tube before she came back to your house.", "Your cravings are your responsibility to deal with, it wasn't your ice cream to satisfy your cravings. You could have got your own, or at least asked her before taking some of what isn't yours.\n\nThe big deal isn't the couple of spoons of ice cream, it's your clear lack of respect of a very easy and clear boundary.", "Maybe - there's a lot about your relationship that can't be seen in this snapshot. \n\nHowever (1) men are really socialized not to listen to women and (2) she's doubtless been interacting with a lot of guys who don't listen her whole life. That can make you pretty touchy about being ignored.\n\nWhen I tell someone, clearly, in English, \"this is important to me\", I expect them to pay attention IF I'm important to them. That doesn't mean they have to \"follow my orders,\" but we at least need to talk before they decide to totally ignore what I said. And if they don't...well, maybe I 'm not important to them after all. \n\nAgain, a snapshot. But this seems worth a conversation with your GF. Bottom line, her reason for being upset (and your response) are what matters in your relationship.", "It\u2019s also a bit crazy that she asked you one simple thing not to touch and you deliberately ignored her, thought it was funny, and now are doubling down and arguing with everybody refusing to admit that you were wrong.", "You are the one who told us she said not to eat the ice cream. You also said you ate the ice cream. You disrespected her when you did that. You ignored what she said not to do. Speaks volumes that you won\u2019t listen to the advice you\u2019re given because you don\u2019t like it. Apologize and start listening to your girlfriend.", "That's exactly how I interpreted 'cheekily'.", "Saw your edit- you\u2019re still invalidating her, so as expected, you\u2019ve learned nothing. You didn\u2019t say you\u2019d begin respecting her boundaries, either. I give it a few more months tops.\n\nThe fact that you think the solution would have been asking her again for her food when she said no clearly already is really the icing on the cake! \ud83d\ude02", "Who would do that?? What kind of a test is that? That seems insane.", "It's also crazy that GF just claimed OPs freezer space, tho. Like.. it's his house."]}
