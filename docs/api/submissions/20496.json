If anything you should be happy since they\u2019re wasting less water.", "NAH leaning towards Y T A, but I guess that's just based on my personal view that two naked people in a bathtub isn't significantly different than one naked person in a bathtub. Any nasty stuff that happens in a bathtub is generally gonna go down the drain, and a bathtub is pretty simple to clean anyways.

It is no worse than their sleeping together.", "Did you have to do cleanup, or is there a nasty smell involved? Because if not, sorry man, YTA.

Shower sex, OK, and clean bed sex following a bath, sure, but actual bath sex\u2026 man, personally I already take up too much space in the bath to do much other than just be very very close to a partner if we\u2019re both in there at the same time.

I will never do that to somebody else.\n\nNo one has ever thought it was weird of us relaxing in their tub together much less thought it was rude. Just because they want to enjoy each other's company and soak in a tub together, something that they haven't had the opportunity to do in quite awhile, is quite a bit of a reach to assume they're going to fuck in your tub. They're obviously comfortable with each other's nudity and harming no one plu saving you a bit on your water bill. So what exactly is the issue OP?? Unless they are trying to get you to join them, leave the door open, engage in loud vivacious sex, hog the bathroom for hours, trash the bathroom and expect you to clean it which has 0 to do with bathing together as they would have done it whether they bathed or not except now there's only one mess instead of 2, I honestly don't understand why them bathing together would upset, offend, or bother you at all.\n\nHowever, I am going to label this as NAH as it is your home which you are absolutely within your right to feel comfortable in your own home and bathroom and its your rules which they are to abide by. However, instead of telling them to stop because in all honesty, id feel a little attacked if I were them due to the fact that the reasons that seem to give you hangups about them bathing together are all things I do not do nor engage in whilst bathing with my husband. My advice would be to ask them to follow a couple of nonnegotiable rules whilst bathing such as absolutely no sex in the tub, clean/disinfect & scrub and rinse out the tub, hang damp towels, no water to be left on the floor, keep it to an hour in the tub at max, don't touch my loofah nor use my bubble bath soap.. it's my bubbly bubbly bubble-soap that only I get to melt away into whilst feeling like I'm on a velvety soft bubbly cloud to drift away into  ... It's my goddamn bubble cloud, not anyone else's!! Lol (yes I've had past roommates that would help themselves to my bubble oasis and that's a hill I'm definitely willing to die on)\n\nAside from that, it's an easily amendable situation where no one should have to be an AH and everyone should be able to enjoy their own bubbly get away.", "I\u2019ve taken baths with boyfriend and we\u2019ve never actually had sex in it, it\u2019s honestly it\u2019s a nice chill time. But I can\u2019t speak for her so who knows", "Bathing with your partner without it turning sexual is more the norm than getting freaky in the tub. It's awkward and slippery, fun only once in a while. Chilling in the bath and rubbing eachothers backs, listening to some music and talking, that's where it's at. Sexy time can happen afterwards when you are all clean if that's what you want. But it's still kind of an intimate experience and I would feel a bit weird if my sister her boyfriend took a bath together at my house while I was there.", "Then I assume you'd never had sex in a bath/shower. It's not good or practical. \n\nMy boyfriend and I take showers together frequently. We just..shower and talk/goof around. \n\nNudity does not automatically equal sex.", "It's definitely not a given.", "my bf and i both live w our parents and shower and bathe together at both our parents houses. they\u2019ve never cared lol", "As an overnight guest? Why wouldn\u2019t I (if there was room)", "We do. We don't even think about it. We say \"okay, we're going to go shower, see you in a bit\" and there's no sex involved at all. It's just a shower.", "i understand where you\u2019re coming from here - but bleach works wonders.. not only that but they didn\u2019t waste water, didn\u2019t run up a bill, etc.. this is a small issue to fight with family about. life is too short to fight over a couple taking a shower/bath together. it\u2019s her sister! it\u2019s not a random stranger or a friend.\nedit to add: it\u2019s not a \u201cweird joy..\u201d she stated clearly above they do not have a bath.", "I'm sure OP would mention excessive bath time.", "Bathing with someone isn't inherently sexual, that's ridiculous", "Bathing together does not equate to them having sex lmfao. In fact having sex during a shower or bath sucks and is incredibly hard to pull off. Only in america is bathing together consisdered sexual. Japan does it all the time", "My friend, my hubby and I bathe together all the time. No sex is involved. Bath and shower sex sucks for females because it washes lube away. No lube = no fun.", "If they were staying overnight as a guest?\n\nWhy would I or anyone else have a problem with that?", "I would be absolutely fine if one of my brothers wanted to shower with their significant other.

And why the hell is it anyone else\u2019s business anyway?

Never again", "Pretty much never isn't the same as never, my friend.", "Agreed. Why are people assuming bath=sex?", "Same here, and I agree. It's rooted in the mentality that associates all nudity with sex.", "Showering is a bit different, in my opinion.", "Exactly! I think with guests (at least where I'm from) it's often done out of consideration for water usage and time spent occupying the bathroom. Usually it's just showering together (shorter time) but I can absolutely understand desperately craving an actual soak in a tub having lived without tubs before.", "this sounds lovely and now i want to take a bath with my boyfriend (but at our own home or in a private hotel room\u2026)", "I\u2019ve never been in a tub with my fianc\u00e9 big enough for us to have sex. It\u2019s barely big enough for us to comfortably lay down. And we\u2019re both average height and weight. Plus the water makes it painful because it washes away the natural lube. But I\u2019ve also never found baths to be relaxing.\n\nEven just showering together we don\u2019t do anything. Half the time when I\u2019m going to the bathroom he\u2019ll come in and run a bath for himself and we just talk. The bathroom isn\u2019t as much a sexy place to get it on as people think. Yea you\u2019re naked together but it\u2019s usually a small area and it\u2019s just\u2026 not that sexy.\n\nEdit: if I was a guest at someone\u2019s house I wouldn\u2019t go into the bathroom with him, that\u2019s weird. I\u2019m just saying personally nothing sexy goes on in our bathroom. But I also wouldn\u2019t care if others did it because I simply don\u2019t care. But it\u2019s just to individuals to make that boundary. Personally I wouldn\u2019t care as long as they\u2019re not obvious or loud. I care more about guests getting out of the tub and not putting the shower mat down and getting water all over the floor. Or when they don\u2019t hang it back up to dry. Now that I hate. But again if it\u2019s not something you\u2019re comfortable with, no you\u2019re NTA. That\u2019s just your personal boundary and comfortability.

It's ridiculous.", "Pfp checks out", "Well clearly OP has an issue with it since he posted this", "Wow even the gays don\u2019t bother you lol, you sound great", "Lol them cleaning up would be spraying it down with water, I highly doubt they would actually clean it, I'm not going to stand in sex juices and shower that's gross. They can get a hotel room if they want to do that.", "I mean, I shower with my boyfriend at his sisters house all the time, I\u2019m just looking to get clean and get out\u2026 nothing weird about it\u2026?

Intimate couple time can include everything from talking to snuggling. Why wouldn't OP want to host that? lol They are much more likely to have sex in the guestroom bed, and I am assuming the OP isn't bothered by that.", "i understand that but there\u2019s no evidence that happened.. if they don\u2019t have one at home that doesn\u2019t automatically conclude that that\u2019s what they used it for? it seems like a crappy thing to fight about. it\u2019s small, municipal, and if her sister wasn\u2019t here tomorrow i\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal", "That has nothing to do with what I said, It's just ridiculous that you stated they MUST BE HAVING SEX hahaha", "It\u2019s  weird thing to have an issue with.", "Yeah, but sex in a bathtub isn't practical.

It's your house your rules, but are you going to forbid them from sharing a bed? Sharing a tub is the same type of intimacy. You don't have sex every time you go to bed and even if you do, and you're a guest, the host becomes aware of it inadvertently, the host simply turns a blind eye.

I don\u2019t see the problem. Are they making loud lovemaking? \n\nAs long as they clean the ring in the bath and any mess they make.\n\nI use to love going to my sisters to have a bath. She had a huge claw bath. She would even buy bubble bath for my visits.", "I think it depends where the bathroom was if it was in there private room I wouldn't care but if there was one bathroom in the center of the living room I would be a little to", "Soft YTA. \n\nI think it\u2019s weird that you care about what two consenting adults are doing behind closed doors, your home or not. But, it *is* your house, so I suppose you\u2019re allowed whatever rules you\u2019d like. \n\nAs long as they aren\u2019t spending hours or constantly refilling the tub or destroying your bathroom, I personally don\u2019t see why it matters. It\u2019s your family member and their partner, not some random people you barely know. And I hardly doubt it\u2019s anything sexual going on. Sex in a bathtub is not very pleasant at all, and my husband and I like to take relaxing baths together every now and then. It cuts the time in half and saves water, so that\u2019s a bonus. \n\nFeel free to communicate how you feel and your wish that they don\u2019t do it again. But also be prepared for their possible confusion and offense.", "Info: Why *exactly* does it bother you? Say it aloud.", "I mean your house, your rules.. but I personally don\u2019t see anything wrong with it as long as they were respectful about it. Like no loud sex sounds, etc lol", "YTA Let them  have a bath together. They probably just wanted to relax and have each other as company. Do you mind if they sleep in the same bed at your place?", "Um... NAH\n\n\nHow did you know they took a bath together? Was the door open? Were they being loud and/or saying offensive things? Just because it's a bath doesn't mean they weren't just bathing. And that's personal anyways so who cares if they do it together?", "I feel like we are missing details here, if they are not noisy or making a mess, who cares?", "NAH - but what\u2019s rude about taking a bath in someone\u2019s house aside from perhaps hogging the bathroom? \nTell her you don\u2019t like it, and that should solve the problem", "How did they both fit, though? Now I wanna come over for a bath, too!", "Absolutely you shouldn\u2019t let them make your house a **** house", "Ohhh dear lord... I read that as PARENTS,  not partner and was\nstunned/shocked/scandalized just on the headline alone!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA. Your place, your rules. It was kind of you to allow either of them to use the bath to begin with. It's presumptuous that they'd assume they could use it together, even if it's \"*not for sexy-times*\"", "NAH\nA little odd they didn't ask first but I don't find this to be odd at all. \n\nBut your house your rules on what makes you comfortable", "Maybe they\u2019re trying to be polite and save you water \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "For me personally, I wouldn\u2019t care, and I think relaxing your definition of rudeness might be worth considering.  It was a bit forward of them, though, and you\u2019re NTA for setting a boundary.", "I mean I guess since it\u2019s your house, your rules NTA. I will say though that I find it very weird and policing others behavior. When I have guests in my home I don\u2019t care if they shower together. It\u2019s not my place to parent adults. Showering and bathing together is a perfectly normal thing done daily by most couples. It\u2019s just showering haha. I travel a lot and if someone had that rule I would totally respect their rules, but would just go get a hotel so I could enjoy my time away from home without being told what to do.", "NTA. I am so shocked that others feel differently. I would never shower or even have sex in someone else's house. It seems very rude to me.", "NTA.... that's a very intimate thing to just openly do in someone else's home as a guest. There's an understanding that sharing a bed as a guest may or may not lead to some after-hours sex in someone's home, but that's a private space that's given to you for your stay. Taking a bath with your partner in someone else's home crosses a line, to me, because a bathroom is a shared space that other people need to/have a right to access, too, and that's not an appropriate place to take an intimate act like bathing together (even if it isn't sex).", "So this has already happened, I think it\u2019s acceptable to maybe ask for a compromise. They should clean it afterwards, hair, skin scum, the wet floor etc. It\u2019s normal to take baths with your partner, but I also think it\u2019s okay to ask them not to do it. Think about exactly why it makes you uncomfortable. Maybe you think it\u2019s dangerous cause someone can slip, maybe it\u2019s not a big enough tub and it could break, maybe it makes a big mess, maybe it\u2019s your personal space and prefer one person at time. But don\u2019t just say \u201cbecause it\u2019s weird and rude\u201d, give them a real reason so they can understand your side of it. Oh and saying please always helps. NAH", "They were being good guests, and trying to save you water. :-)\n\nHow considerate of them!", "NTA", "NTA assuming we\u2019re talking about just a bath that is just big enough to be used as a bath. No it\u2019s not ridiculous. Plus every time they move around they risk it overflowing over the sides.", "NAH.  I can see it being weird, but not THAT weird.  Especially if it's something they always wanted to do", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with it, and is a lovely thing.", "She's your a sister, right?  She doesn't have a bath.  Suck it up.  Let her have a bath with her boyfriend.  One day you'll both be dead!", "YTA -- they weren't being rude, this wasn't a rule you set out for them and no, it's not immediately intuitive that you wouldn't want them to do this. I'm presuming they weren't having loud sex in there, in which case I'm not sure what the problem is?\n\nHow do you even KNOW they shared a bath? I think the big issue here is why you are paying any attention at all to how 2 consenting adults spend time in a bathroom, regardless of who owns that bathroom, as long as you don't have to hear it or clean up after it.", "I'm going to say YTA over the invasion of privacy. TMI to be honest. Why are you even trying to find out what they do together? Shower, bath, sleep, change clothes, some things are done privately. I wouldn't find it appropriate to control anything someone does in my bathroom. Then again, I'm also nervous about people having bad manners so I'm not very willing to invite others to stay the night.", "Yta , and a prude as well", "YTA, if you did you establish it before hand, only one person in the bath at a time, then its weird to say something now. \nThey're also adults and married, you have no right to dictate their sex lives, your home or not. They weren't doing it out in the open and if they cleaned up afterwards why are you really mad?", "If this was a distant guest then NTA but because it\u2019s your sister YTA. She\u2019s your sibling, you grew up together, I\u2019m sure there were plenty of times when she had boys over in the same house as you growing up. I couldn\u2019t imagine putting such weird restrictions on my sister, she treats my house like it\u2019s hers and vice versa.", "I'm surprised how many people are saying N T A. If they're sharing a bed, there's no reason why they can't bathe together.", "I think the answer depends on how nice a tub you have. \n\nNah, I can't place a critical judgement, my first thought is just let people have fun tho. Especially if you have a big nice tub. lol", "NTA, they need to respect that they are not in their private home or a hotel. It\u2019s not the norm to bathe with something together in your house.", "NTA. That is pretty strange. They should have at least asked you first. I would never do that at my siblings house personally but I can also see some people not caring at all about it. Valid that you felt strange.", "YTA.\n\nYoure making assumptions that are unwarranted, and even if they were, who are they hurting? Its a bath, its literally the easiest place to clean if theyre being frisky.", "Don't think about the fact that they left a ring of man (or woman) jizz around your bathtub.", "nta, but stop being a prude.  why do you care what other people do in the bathroom?  were they loudly eating each other out or something? lol", "Them bathing together saved you money lol", "How is this rude, exactly?", "Maybe i\u2019m crazy but it\u2019s way more likely they bathed together to do SOMETHING lewd than \u201csave water\u201d", "YTA end of period", "Idk if really an asshole, but everyone does do partners/friendships/boundaries differently. Especially surrounding home spaces. \n\nI have a bath at my house that is pretty luxurious, can fit 3/4 people in it and whenever mates and couples stay, always offer it to them because it's a good time and I want to share it around. My partner and I regularly bathe in it but don't think we've once had sex in it? In fact of all the baths I've taken with partners, I think I've had sex in one. Mostly we just drink wine, light candles, put on some music and chat and unwind in a warm comfy place.\n\nBut I live in social circles where my friends will give my partner and I their beds because \"it's better for sex\" when I stay at their houses. Kinda like my circle gets if my partner and I are on a holiday, we got some business to attend to.\n\nAs I write this I realise I live probably outside of social norms and maybe my opinion isn't as valid on this one.", "Damn, I guess I'm a bad person. I have had sex in the shower at my family's houses several times. Of course, when my family visited me, they had sex in my house, including the shower.\n\nWhy do people get upset when someone else doing something they like?", "NTA that\u2019s definitely awkward", "NTA. Dont care what the other comments say, this is a bit fucking weird to do in someone else's house.

How?   \n\nIf it's some prudish sex thing, then why are you comfortable with them sleeping together in the same bed but not this?\n\nThe only thing I can think of is if they monopolised the bath for several hours and made other people wait.   \nOr splashed water all over the floor and didn't clean up.  \nOr left a tub ring of soap and grime.   \n\nYet, you didn't actually mention anything they did that caused any trouble.\n\nSo, you'll need to better articulate what it actually is you think was wrong with what they did, to get any judgement other than YTA.", "NTA sister should\u2019ve rented a hotel room or gone to a spa together. \u201cHey sis, while I\u2019m happy to give you the opportunity to relax in a bath, I am not okay with partner bathing.

How nice is the bathtub?", "Personally it wouldn\u2019t bother me at all as long as they didn\u2019t use all the hot water or hog the bathroom for too long. \n\nBut\u2026 if it bothers you then tell her in a non confrontational manner that you would prefer them not to bathe together as it makes you uncomfortable. Try not to make a massive thing out of it as there is no need to fall out over it and she will more than likely respect your boundary if she isn\u2019t made to feel like an arsehole for doing it in the first place.", "NAH.\nIt\u2019s weird (to me) that they would bathe together, but it\u2019ll be even weirder if you bring it up to them.", "If they do anything gross it's cool because the water will wash it away.", "It\u2019s your house, your rules. But you are a bit uptight about this. I wouldn\u2019t call you an AH for this but it seems silly to be bothered by it. So what if they are together in the bath fucking or not?

Sometimes it\u2019s nice to relax with my partner in the tub, it\u2019s not sexual, we can just read poetry to each other. In my last marriage we sometimes got the whole family in the hot tub to make dinner! For a while we had a kitchen set up right next to it, but, well, you only drop a knife into a hot tub with the jets on full blast while listening to Enya and \u201ccutting onions\u201d when your kid steps on it\u2026 because you only get one chance\u2026\u2026 Im in a better place now though, that\u2019s not me anymore.\n\nSo to answer your question, yea, I think tubs are alright.", "I'm really surprised by these takes. Honestly, I don't know why y'all would rather your guests fuck in the sheets you're going to clean on top of the moisture-absorbing mattress that lives in your house. \n\nTubs can be bleached.

We do brush up against each other's privates but it's mostly for the being togetherness of spending time with each other in a private little bubble doing something relaxing. \n\nI get strong Purity Culture vibes from the homeowner here.
