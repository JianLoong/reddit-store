Any nasty stuff that happens in a bathtub is generally gonna go down the drain, and a bathtub is pretty simple to clean anyways.

It is no worse than their sleeping together.", "Did you have to do cleanup, or is there a nasty smell involved? Because if not, sorry man, YTA.

Shower sex, OK, and clean bed sex following a bath, sure, but actual bath sex\u2026 man, personally I already take up too much space in the bath to do much other than just be very very close to a partner if we\u2019re both in there at the same time.

I will never do that to somebody else.\n\nNo one has ever thought it was weird of us relaxing in their tub together much less thought it was rude. Just because they want to enjoy each other's company and soak in a tub together, something that they haven't had the opportunity to do in quite awhile, is quite a bit of a reach to assume they're going to fuck in your tub. They're obviously comfortable with each other's nudity and harming no one plu saving you a bit on your water bill. So what exactly is the issue OP?? Unless they are trying to get you to join them, leave the door open, engage in loud vivacious sex, hog the bathroom for hours, trash the bathroom and expect you to clean it which has 0 to do with bathing together as they would have done it whether they bathed or not except now there's only one mess instead of 2, I honestly don't understand why them bathing together would upset, offend, or bother you at all.\n\nHowever, I am going to label this as NAH as it is your home which you are absolutely within your right to feel comfortable in your own home and bathroom and its your rules which they are to abide by. However, instead of telling them to stop because in all honesty, id feel a little attacked if I were them due to the fact that the reasons that seem to give you hangups about them bathing together are all things I do not do nor engage in whilst bathing with my husband. My advice would be to ask them to follow a couple of nonnegotiable rules whilst bathing such as absolutely no sex in the tub, clean/disinfect & scrub and rinse out the tub, hang damp towels, no water to be left on the floor, keep it to an hour in the tub at max, don't touch my loofah nor use my bubble bath soap.. it's my bubbly bubbly bubble-soap that only I get to melt away into whilst feeling like I'm on a velvety soft bubbly cloud to drift away into  ... It's my goddamn bubble cloud, not anyone else's!! Lol (yes I've had past roommates that would help themselves to my bubble oasis and that's a hill I'm definitely willing to die on)\n\nAside from that, it's an easily amendable situation where no one should have to be an AH and everyone should be able to enjoy their own bubbly get away.", "I\u2019ve taken baths with boyfriend and we\u2019ve never actually had sex in it, it\u2019s honestly it\u2019s a nice chill time. But I can\u2019t speak for her so who knows", "Bathing with your partner without it turning sexual is more the norm than getting freaky in the tub. It's awkward and slippery, fun only once in a while. Chilling in the bath and rubbing eachothers backs, listening to some music and talking, that's where it's at. Sexy time can happen afterwards when you are all clean if that's what you want. But it's still kind of an intimate experience and I would feel a bit weird if my sister her boyfriend took a bath together at my house while I was there.", "Then I assume you'd never had sex in a bath/shower. It's not good or practical. \n\nMy boyfriend and I take showers together frequently. We just..shower and talk/goof around. \n\nNudity does not automatically equal sex.", "It's definitely not a given.", "my bf and i both live w our parents and shower and bathe together at both our parents houses. they\u2019ve never cared lol", "As an overnight guest? Why wouldn\u2019t I (if there was room)", "We do. We don't even think about it. We say \"okay, we're going to go shower, see you in a bit\" and there's no sex involved at all. It's just a shower.", "i understand where you\u2019re coming from here - but bleach works wonders.. not only that but they didn\u2019t waste water, didn\u2019t run up a bill, etc.. this is a small issue to fight with family about. life is too short to fight over a couple taking a shower/bath together. it\u2019s her sister! it\u2019s not a random stranger or a friend.\nedit to add: it\u2019s not a \u201cweird joy..\u201d she stated clearly above they do not have a bath.", "I'm sure OP would mention excessive bath time.", "Bathing with someone isn't inherently sexual, that's ridiculous", "Bathing together does not equate to them having sex lmfao. In fact having sex during a shower or bath sucks and is incredibly hard to pull off. Only in america is bathing together consisdered sexual. Japan does it all the time", "My friend, my hubby and I bathe together all the time. No sex is involved. Bath and shower sex sucks for females because it washes lube away. No lube = no fun.", "If they were staying overnight as a guest?\n\nWhy would I or anyone else have a problem with that?", "I would be absolutely fine if one of my brothers wanted to shower with their significant other. I don't care enough about their sex lives to get upset about it. And my oldest brother is gay and it still doesn't bother me. Who cares what they do as long as they clean up after themselves.", "Agree. LOL my sister has taken showers with all her boyfriends (one of them is now her husband) at my PARENT'S house over the yrs. When i was younger I found this incredibly scandalous, but now that I'm older I realize they were just showering! \n\nI would think taking a bath is rude though. I live in CA and a bathtub that big would waste A LOT of water and energy to heat.", "Only if you think nudity must equate to sex.", "And so what if they did?  They are overnight house guests.", "How do you mean? I've definitely been excited to take a bath after not being able to for a long time", "Yeah, it\u2019s an AH rule.\n\nWhy would anyone care?", "True but I would also be weirded out if someone did that in my house.", "Right? And why the hell is it anyone else\u2019s business anyway? If they\u2019re not hogging the bathroom so that no one else can use it, and aren\u2019t making obnoxious sounds or messes that they leave behind, why the hell is it anyone else\u2019s business? YTA @OP", "It's not weird. Not even a little bit.", "They are family overnight guests.\n\nWhy would I want them to not feel at home?\n\nWho cares how they use the bathtub? (As long as they don\u2019t leave a mess)", "They could buy an inflatable pool at their house too.", "As a good friend of mine used to say, water is a coolant, not a lubricant.", "Bath sex is horrible, and painful. Never again", "Pretty much never isn't the same as never, my friend.", "Agreed. Why are people assuming bath=sex?", "Same here, and I agree. It's rooted in the mentality that associates all nudity with sex.", "Showering is a bit different, in my opinion.", "Exactly! I think with guests (at least where I'm from) it's often done out of consideration for water usage and time spent occupying the bathroom. Usually it's just showering together (shorter time) but I can absolutely understand desperately craving an actual soak in a tub having lived without tubs before.", "this sounds lovely and now i want to take a bath with my boyfriend (but at our own home or in a private hotel room\u2026)", "I\u2019ve never been in a tub with my fianc\u00e9 big enough for us to have sex. It\u2019s barely big enough for us to comfortably lay down. And we\u2019re both average height and weight. Plus the water makes it painful because it washes away the natural lube. But I\u2019ve also never found baths to be relaxing.\n\nEven just showering together we don\u2019t do anything. Half the time when I\u2019m going to the bathroom he\u2019ll come in and run a bath for himself and we just talk. The bathroom isn\u2019t as much a sexy place to get it on as people think. Yea you\u2019re naked together but it\u2019s usually a small area and it\u2019s just\u2026 not that sexy.\n\nEdit: if I was a guest at someone\u2019s house I wouldn\u2019t go into the bathroom with him, that\u2019s weird. I\u2019m just saying personally nothing sexy goes on in our bathroom. But I also wouldn\u2019t care if others did it because I simply don\u2019t care. But it\u2019s just to individuals to make that boundary. Personally I wouldn\u2019t care as long as they\u2019re not obvious or loud. I care more about guests getting out of the tub and not putting the shower mat down and getting water all over the floor. Or when they don\u2019t hang it back up to dry. Now that I hate. But again if it\u2019s not something you\u2019re comfortable with, no you\u2019re NTA. That\u2019s just your personal boundary and comfortability. Let them know you\u2019d rather they shower or bathe separately.", "Not trying to turn this conversation seedy. But if you get any kind of rhythm going, then you are looking at a lot of water spillage.", "Okay, then bath time might not be sexy time, but it sure sounds like some variety of intimate couple time and I can see why OP wouldn't want to host that for a sibling (but also there is no guarantee that sexy time isn't happening).", "Yup - water is a terrible lubricant", "if i\u2019m having to bleach someone\u2019s sex after effects out of my bathtub i\u2019m going to be pissed. this just seems like the sort of thing that\u2019s better suited for a special getaway at a hotel, not your family member\u2019s home", "Well if he's uncomfortable with it then they should respect that since it's his house", "As an American, I can tell you that Americans equate ANY nudity to sex. It's ridiculous.", "Pfp checks out", "Well clearly OP has an issue with it since he posted this", "Wow even the gays don\u2019t bother you lol, you sound great", "Lol them cleaning up would be spraying it down with water, I highly doubt they would actually clean it, I'm not going to stand in sex juices and shower that's gross. They can get a hotel room if they want to do that.", "I mean, I shower with my boyfriend at his sisters house all the time, I\u2019m just looking to get clean and get out\u2026 nothing weird about it\u2026? O.o\n\nEdit: it\u2019s because we aren\u2019t connected to any water source and his sisters house is, we live in a Native American reservation, it\u2019s deplorable and terrible here.", "Why? Do you imagine a sex fest with flying bodily fluids? Do you know how you clean bodily fluids? WATER.   \n\n\nAnyway, if you are a female and have ever tried sex in water, you will know that it SUCKS. It washes away lube so the sex hurts. Bathing together isn't nearly as sexy as you presume. It's just nice, relaxing, and a way to bond.", "Why, they probably also sleep on the same bed as overnight guests in your house.", "it kind of is given that they explicitly mentioned being excited to use it because they don\u2019t have one in their own home", "Because they've likely never tried it.", "It's not a big assumption that something sexual might occur between two married, naked adults in a confined space.", "Who knows banging in the shower isn't even that fun.", "People don't understand that intimacy doesn't require piv or even remotely sexy times. They think with their genitals and expect that everyone else does too.", "Because that\u2019s a large reason a lot of people shower or bathe with their partners, even if the area is impractical it\u2019s nice foreplay usually.", "I'll make it even more blunt: sex in a bath full of water washes away natural lube (and artificial lube too) and makes sex highly uncomfortable for females. I tried it when I was super young. It sucked. Nowadays, my hubby and I bathe together all the time. Nothing sexual is happening because I would rather have good sex. lol", "OMG. Intimate couple time can include everything from talking to snuggling. Why wouldn't OP want to host that? lol They are much more likely to have sex in the guestroom bed, and I am assuming the OP isn't bothered by that.", "i understand that but there\u2019s no evidence that happened.. if they don\u2019t have one at home that doesn\u2019t automatically conclude that that\u2019s what they used it for? it seems like a crappy thing to fight about. it\u2019s small, municipal, and if her sister wasn\u2019t here tomorrow i\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal", "That has nothing to do with what I said, It's just ridiculous that you stated they MUST BE HAVING SEX hahaha", "It\u2019s  weird thing to have an issue with.", "Yeah, but sex in a bathtub isn't practical. In general, it's a bad idea to have intercourse in any body of water for a variety of reasons and bathtubs aren't known for being spacious.", "Yes it is. Life is not a shonda rhimes show. Folks aren\u2019t out here fucking every time they\u2019re in a closet, operating room, shower, or plane crash. \n\nDamn y\u2019all people who are worried about sex think about it more than those of us having it.", "I used to shower with my ex if we were running late it's a lot faster.", "I used to shower with my fianc\u00e9 just because it was practical to both do it at once until I got too huge during my pregnancy, and then after his schedule changed and he started getting up earlier \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Have you ever been married?", "Have you tried to have sex in a bathtub? It's not *impossible*, but it's very uncomfortable. I tried once (in a big tub) and we both decided never again", "And so what if it does?\n\nThey are overnight house guests, and family.\n\nThey should feel free to feel at home.", "Yep, just chilling in the bath is quite nice.", "if it\u2019s such a small thing, then it shouldn\u2019t be any trouble for the sister to not do it, and there\u2019s no reason it would be a fight. it\u2019s just saying please don\u2019t do that again. if the sister has a problem with it that\u2019s on her. it\u2019s not her house", "Well either way if they were or not, it's his house and if he doesn't want them bathing together then that's that, because it's his place", "Agreed. That bathtub scene in Bull Durham is completely unrealistic!", "Tried it years ago, ended up with a broken rib and a black eye. Baths are slippery.", "Not that I\u2019m disagreeing with you, but that\u2019s never stopped horny people before unfortunately.", "Shonda is a damn hero. \ud83d\udc95", "Now why is Shonda in it? \ud83d\ude05", "But we're discussing bathing, not showering", "Currently, which is why I don't think it's a big assumption that something sexual or intimate is likely to occur when a married couple is naked together in a small space.", "you know what they say about assuming.. if it\u2019s that serious ask her to clean the tub.. most people have high water bills in my area currently, i would be thrilled considering my water bill wouldn\u2019t be higher due to water usage. not here to argue, just my insight :)", "Again, nothing to do with what I said. I'm just saying you can bathe with someone without everyone having this weird need to sexualise everything.", "Bathing is the act of cleansing one\u2019s self and even if it were a bath intimacy does not equal sex", "Bathing together is also faster if you're running late.", "Congratulations...or I'm sorry? That sounds like a lot of you and your partner can't be baked in each others vicinity without going to town \ud83d\ude02"]}
