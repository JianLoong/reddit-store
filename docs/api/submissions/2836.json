When my doctor gave me a clean bill of health, we immediately began planning for our wedding. \n\nBecause the wedding almost didn't happen, one thing that really mattered to my fianc\u00e9 and I was that we really got to experience the \"magic\" of the wedding we almost didn't have. One of those moments was a first look where my fianc\u00e9 expressed that he really wanted to be surprised by my dress and have a moment to take it all in just the two of us (he said he's always wanted to see me as a bride).\n\nWe made this very clear to everyone who went wedding shopping with me, and they all knew the reason why. I was super concerned about my MIL specifically because she had already previously forwarded inspiration images of my dress to my fianc\u00e9 that I had sent to my bridal party for reference. My fianc\u00e9 was upset, they had a talk, and everything seemed ok.\n\nBecause my MIL said she did it from \"being too excited\" and it didn't seem malicious, I decided to extend an invite to the actual dress shopping with one rule: she had to give her phone to my MOH. She agreed, but the day of, my mother saw that she took my SIL's phone and sneakily took photos. \n\nI told her to stop, and she got defensive, and we ended up fighting to the point where I asked MIL and SIL to leave. I felt like they betrayed my trust and ruined what was supposed to be a special moment. My fianc\u00e9 is on my side, but the rest of his family thinks I was being too dramatic over \"one photo\". I think it's bigger than just the photo and has to do with my trust, but now the two sides are split.

So they get to find out with everyone else. \n\nThat being said-  don\u2019t let your need for \u201cspecial moments \u201c ruin your wedding.  It is supposed to be the celebration of a new life together,  not the right knife to cut the cake.

If they cant follow simple rules they deserved it.", "NTA. I\u2019m not gonna lie, the beginning of this sounded a *touch* over the top, but \u201cplease don\u2019t take pictures of my wedding dress and send them to your son\u201d is an EXTREMELY reasonable request.", "NTA\n\nApparently (justifiably) treating her like a naughty child didn\u2019t work, so good luck where you go from there.", "NTA and I think they just lost the ability to be trusted with confidential information about their son/brother for a long long time.", "NTA. You explained why you had a no phone policy, and your MIL and SIL ignored it. They deserved to be kicked out of the dress shopping.", "NTA.   Good luck with your soon to be MIL and SIL.   I think you are going to need it.", "NTA, and a giant betrayal of your trust and boundaries. Should definitely not back down and decide if you want them to be involved in the wedding.", "NTA,\n\nYour MIL has proven herself untrustworthy not once but now twice.\n\nYou did the right thing kicking her out.\nShe\u2019s doing major boundary stomping and probably will in the future, be prepared and put her on an information diet from now on.\n \nI\u2019m pleased your fianc\u00e9 has got your back, that is a good thing.\n\nGood luck with your wedding!", "NTA - boundaries and consequences\u2026 you play stupid games you win stupid prizes\u2026 you behave badly, you get punished.\n\nLet\u2019s make no mistake.  Your MIL planned to do this.  She wanted SIL to come with her to use SILs phone to send a pic to fianc\u00e9.  And once the pic was sent, there would be no do overs.\n\nYour MIL is making this about her.  It\u2019s you and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding.  Be wary of MIL, this isn\u2019t the last thing she is going to pull to one up you\u2026", "NTA. Your reasons for kicking them out of the shopping are very good. But you could take away your health history, and the whole first look part of it, and still be good. The \"no photos\" rule alone, for whatever reason, or even no reason at all, is more than enough.\n\nThey broke the rule. They experienced consequences.\n\nYou are absolutely correct that this is more than just \"one photo\". It is is about your trust. Its also about more than that. Its about a lack of respect for you and your fianc\u00e9, you know FMILs son.\n\nIt is fabulous to hear that your fianc\u00e9 is supporting you in this. Hopefully he is taking the lead in shutting down his family. Here's some thoughts on points for him to consider in doing so.\n\nFMIL may be excited about the wedding. But her excitement is not more important than the excitement of both of you. It is *your* wedding, not hers. It ok for her to be excited. But it has to be excitement that supports your excitement and amps it up. Not excitement that damps down yours.\n\nWhat she's tried multiple times now is actually stealing from you. **Both of you.** She is trying to steal that moment where your fianc\u00e9 sees you in your wedding dress from you. But she is also stealing that momemt from her own son. (Emphasize that part with his family to no end.)\n\nFuther, it does not matter if what she is trying to share is a picture of you in **The Dress**, or even just **The Dress**. *Anything* dress related that she shares with her son is stealing that moment from him. Maybe not all at once, but bit by bit.\n\nNow, she might say she wasn't going to share the photo with him. That's nice. Then why was she trying to take the photo, then? Oh, for her memories... Which... Well, there's a solution to that could have fulfilled her desire for capturing the moment while still honoring your request. She could have asked for you to have someone like your MOH or your mom take some photos with their phone and save them to share *after the wedding*.\n\nAnd thats without even getting into her previous overstep and the lack of good judgement demonstrated there.\n\nThat she delibrerately took action that she knew was against what you and your fianc\u00e9 want says she does not care about either you or her son. She only cares about her own self satisfaction.\n\nAt this point, FMIL has a choice. On the one hand, she can admit that what she's been trying to do is wrong and learn to respect your boundaries and expectations. Which will allow her to continue being made privy to details of the wedding. On the other hand, she can contine her current path. Which will undoutably result in her learning everything on your wedding day, just like any other guest.\n\nAs for her supporters, well frankly this is neither their circus or their monkeys (though they're trying to by flying monkeys for FMIL), so they can leave well enough alone...\n\nBecause on the gripping hand, it is you and your fianc\u00e9's wedding and you have the right to protect it from any of them from ruining it before it even happens.", "NTA. Your future MIL sounds terrible she violated your trust and boundaries multiple times and now she's crying to other people about it trying to make you the bad guy. Wtf. I agree with the people who said you should be concerned about what you are marrying into with this family but I am happy to hear that your fiance has your back. I hope you have a beautiful wedding good luck.", "Maybe you could sneak some photos of her undressed, then her know you have them and will release them to the Internet if she spoils the dress surprise.

That your SIL helped your MIL sneaking unconsented pictures of you is shitty behaviour and your reaction was totally appropriate.
