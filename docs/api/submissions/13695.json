If you go in like an ogre, she will see you as one. Your little girl is growing up and developing crushes, which is normal and healthy. You need to wrap your head around that.", "YTA. Doodling hearts with a boy's name in it is something that would never, ever be shown to the boy, even if it was someone she actually knew. That is not even a note to a boy.\n\n(If it was an adult, it's still pretty normal for a 13 year old to get a crush on some adult and doodle love hearts.)\n\nIt was in her pocket, probably meant to be a secret. \n\nLet your daughter have crushes without embarrassing her about it. She isn't doing anything wrong.", "Not only are YTA, but you\u2019ve all but ensured your daughter will do a much better job of keeping her love interests a secret from you in the future.", "YTA. There was nothing in that note that indicated she was writing to some guy. That was a typical teenage girl type of doodle. You overreacted.\n\nYou don't know who Matthew Morrison is???", "YTA - plus you\u2019ve probably irrevocably impacted your relationship with your daughter by being an over protective A. Is this why you home school her? For control?", "INFO How does a name written on paper in her pocket become \"writing to a grown man\" so quickly?", "YTA, dude she is 13. She likes boys. Does she not have posters of her celebrity heartthrobs on her walls? Little heart scribbles all over her notebooks and maybe the soles of her shoes? You fond a little heart note in her pocket and embarrass her assumed it was from a grown man which btw is just weird to assume that\u2026dude bad form.", "This is the new account for that guy that was nosing around the period stains in his daughter\u2019s panties, isn\u2019t it?", "YTA. \nYour kid is 13, and this is what 13-year-olds do. I understand feeling wary/concerned about it, but you have to be very conscious about how you approach situations with your teenagers, or really any age child. If you show them that you are not a safe person to open up to, they will not open up to you, then, you really won\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in their life. You can\u2019t keep your kids safe if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in their lives.", "YTA. You've just demonstrated to your daughter that you're freaked out by potential boyfriends, and it's not safe to talk to you.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a celebrity crush. Thousands of teenage girls  do stuff like this, ur being nosy and your daughter will not confide in you in the future", "YTA. That\u2019s perfectly normal teenager stuff. I wish you\u2019d asked your wife about it first. It\u2019s not the end of the world, but trust your daughter so she feels safe talking to you.", "YTA and if you continue, you're daughter will never trust you with anything.", "YTA\n\nYou want to know how to make sure your daughter never ever comes to you if a grown man *does* start creeping on her? It\u2019s this. This right here. Flying off the handle, interrogating her on even the meerest *whiff* of paranoid suspicion, treating every innocent little note as evidence of something terrible and then handling that in the *worst possible way*. None of this makes her trust you will be safe and helpful to her if someone *does* do something sketchy. What you need to do is 1) cool your fucking jets and 2) have a mature and *rational* discussion with her about dating and the risks she will face as a young girl. She needs to know warning signs for abuse, and strategies predators will use (like telling her she\u2019s so mature for her age, telling her that only *they* can understand her and her struggles. Pushing very quickly for intimacy that she\u2019s not ready to give both emotional and physical). And then tell her what to do if she encounters them and what *you* will do. And it needs to be better than \u201cget angry and interrogate her\u201d. She needs to feel *safe* about you and your responses to her or else she will never speak to you if she does have issues.", "YTA. Great way to make sure she gets better at hiding stuff from you.", "YTA. This is not how you build a trusting relationship with your daughter as she navigates her journey into womanhood.", "YTA, this is just typical teenage girl stuff, back off.", "YTA- I understand your concern for your daughter since she is homeschooled and you do not know who this \u201cMatthew Morrison\u201d is, but its an innocent note. It was not labelled to anyone, nor was it a fully written love letter. It was a name in a heart, standard 13 y/o behavior. That note could have had absolutely no meaning to it. It could have been about a celebrity (which is was) or a friend of hers. Only she knew, so you confronting her about it in an upset manner does not seem appropriate. Shes 13, welcome to the teenage years where she is going to become more involved and interested in romance and romantic relationships. Buckle up, you will have a lot of these and more intense experiences coming your way!", "Wow, you really never were a child, huh? I love how you jumped to it being a \"man.\" I used to be a 13 year old girl. As a parent, if you find a note like that in your kid's pocket, you put it back and pretend you didn't see it. Kids have crushes all the time, and making them feel like that is somehow wrong, is a good way to ensure your child never trusts you with anything important. Ask me how I know.", "Yup.  YTA.", "YTA.\n\nPlease watch Turning Red. Repeatedly, if you must, until you get it.", "Seeing that and suspecting she\u2019s corresponding with someone let alone an adult man is so strange to me. YTA", "YTA\n\nThis is the most normal teenage girl behavior i've ever heard of! Let her be, she just has a crush on a celeb, like nearly all girls in her age have...", "YTA\n\nDon't be a snoop. So what if Matthew Morrison had had been a guy shew knew? Since she had the paper in her pocket, she clearly hadn't given it to Matthew, so it wasn't a love note. And there was no reason to think Matthew was a grown man.\n\nAnd why shouldn't she write to a boy without you knowing? That's what teenagers do! Did you not? Did  you not get crushes when you were a teenager? \n\nI'm glad your wife chided you--you need a wakeup call. Let your daughter be a teenager!\n\nAnd for what it's worth, Matthew Morrison's character is a great choice for a celebrity crush. He's very talented, and has a good reputation.", "YTA\n\nI covered whole notebooks in doodles about boys I had crushes on at that age. Jumping to \"it might be a man\" is a huge leap--especially when she's homeschooled.", "With how quickly you freaked out over this, I\u2019m going to guess that\u2019s why she\u2019s homeschooled? It\u2019s typical preteen-teen girl behavior. More girls do it than don\u2019t. Even if it was someone she knew, she\u2019d never show the boy that. YTA. Calm down. And honestly the smartest thing would have been to google the name, which would have gave you that answer, then talk to your wife about it. Better for her to bring it up if it\u2019s needed because it\u2019s mortifying for a young girl to know her dad knows her crush.", "YTA it's normal and healthy for kids to start exploring these feelings. You were absolutely in the wrong for overreacting and embarrassing her over this. A simple \"I love so-and-so\" sentence is not a red flag in any way. It also in no way reads like a note to another person.", "YTA. Wow. That poor girl.", "Yes, YTA. That was a major overreaction. Kids have crushes and write letters and notes to themselves about it. Especially in their early teens. Deal with it, buddy.", "YTA\n\nAt 13 I wrote the name of a boy I had a crush on (who never knew I existed) all over my notebook", "YTA. Don't shame your daughter for having normal feelings. Talk with her, not at her. Keep communication open, let her know your concerns but if you don't have open communication she will hide more stuff from you", "YTA\n\nShe's a teenager, let her be a teenager, you've now ensured that she won't ever go to you for romantic advice or anything related to that.\n\nAnd you blew things up way out of proportion, to assume she was being groomed because of a note on her pocket is a but hysterical. Being homeschooled already limits her social life, and you going through her pockets and confronting her about makes her feel even more suffocated.", "YTA. Go listen to Warren Zevon's \"Tenderness on the Block\" and take it to heart.", "YTA. There were some massive jumps to conclusions in this one post. How does any of that equal her writing love notes to anyone, let alone a grown man? The way this is presented is pretty weird and creepy.", "YTA , and controlling af. it is completely normal for a 13 year old to have a crush, the only cause for concern is that it was matthew morrison.  that man should be jailed.", "NAH\n\nA note does not constitute a relationship.  At 13 I wrote \u201cI love (insert boy)\u201d all the time and nothing ever came of it - hell half of them probably didn\u2019t know I existed. Probably most of them were celebrities or fictional.\n\nHaving a frank discussion with your daughter about boys, relationships, safety, and all that is a good idea but getting over-excited is going to lead to your daughter being afraid to talk to you/confide in you.\n\nAnd for the love of all goodness please don\u2019t be one of THOSE dads\u2026.you know darn well what I mean.", "NAH. Basic parental concern; basic teenage crush. You were also straight and communicative with her--no weird cyber investigation, although it would have been a very short Google search before finding he's an actor on Glee.", "Obviously YTA\n\nShe's a teen. She's going to like basically any male, and you are never going to know who all of them are and why did you feel the \"need\" to know who this one was?\n\nThis is why kids lie in their journals.

You had good intentions. NAH", "[deleted]", "NTA but clueless.  In a good way.", "NTA I would've been concerned too, considering she's homeschooled and you had no idea where she may have met this person lol just make sure you let her know you were only asking and that you're sorry if you embarrassed her because that wasn't your intention at all.", "NTA. Sounds like you just asked her who he was not like you threatened to kill the glee cast, jeez people. Are parents not allowed to talk to their kids anymore, did I miss that update or something??", "nah\n\ni mean, best to be sure she's not writing letters to a grown man or something like that, right?\n\nsure you were just curious if she was", "NTA.\n\n\nBut funny even I recognized that name.

You see it happen to abuse victims when parents wants to hide how they treat them.\nSometimes, they do it to control who their kids are allowed to see\u2014like other kids they don\u2019t approve of. Like boys. \n\nDo I think you\u2019re homeschooling for control? No idea. Not gonna make that assumption.
