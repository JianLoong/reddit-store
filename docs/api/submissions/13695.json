What you need to do is 1) cool your fucking jets and 2) have a mature and *rational* discussion with her about dating and the risks she will face as a young girl. She needs to know warning signs for abuse, and strategies predators will use (like telling her she\u2019s so mature for her age, telling her that only *they* can understand her and her struggles. Pushing very quickly for intimacy that she\u2019s not ready to give both emotional and physical). And then tell her what to do if she encounters them and what *you* will do.
