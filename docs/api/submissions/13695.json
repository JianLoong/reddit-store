None of this makes her trust you will be safe and helpful to her if someone *does* do something sketchy. What you need to do is 1) cool your fucking jets and 2) have a mature and *rational* discussion with her about dating and the risks she will face as a young girl. She needs to know warning signs for abuse, and strategies predators will use (like telling her she\u2019s so mature for her age, telling her that only *they* can understand her and her struggles. Pushing very quickly for intimacy that she\u2019s not ready to give both emotional and physical). And then tell her what to do if she encounters them and what *you* will do.

It could have been about a celebrity (which is was) or a friend of hers. Only she knew, so you confronting her about it in an upset manner does not seem appropriate.

Buckle up, you will have a lot of these and more intense experiences coming your way!", "Wow, you really never were a child, huh? I love how you jumped to it being a \"man.\" I used to be a 13 year old girl. As a parent, if you find a note like that in your kid's pocket, you put it back and pretend you didn't see it.

And honestly the smartest thing would have been to google the name, which would have gave you that answer, then talk to your wife about it. Better for her to bring it up if it\u2019s needed because it\u2019s mortifying for a young girl to know her dad knows her crush.", "YTA it's normal and healthy for kids to start exploring these feelings.

I was 21 at the time. \n\nMy dad locked and unlocked his car to make it beep. We got ourselves together. My BF thought my dad would murder him. I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen. \n\nMy dad walked out , gave a quick wave, and went to work. \n\nThe first time he *officially* met the BF, my dad shook his hand and said \u201cit\u2019s nice to meet you from this angle\u201d. \n\nIt was very funny. And very awkward. My dad still jokes about it with me and the boyfriend\u2026.who was promoted to husband. Him and my dad are still great friends.", "It's controlling parents like that who years later are all \"why don't they date and get married?\" Um....it was just too hard to even think about being normal under these circumstances.", "That\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m sorry to hear that. With guys like this, I always wonder what they were doing at the exact same age they are demanding absolute abstinence from their kids. \n\nMakes ya think.", "And you've never had one, ever ever ever?\n\nCongratulations, you're special and unique and so different from all the other kids! Have some poor person's gold as a prize!\ud83e\udd47", "He got promoted! Congrats \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd29 \nAnd what an awesome Dad!", "\u201cI know what boys are like\u201d is code for \u201cI\u2019m a predator\u201d", "Yeah I haven\u2019t had one. Thanks for the gold\u270c\ud83c\udffc", "Yeah he is. It\u2019s one of those things you only realize with time\u2026.but him and my mom had two girls and a boy. All 3 of us were raised with the same rules and expectations. \n\nHe never treated me like his \u201cproperty\u201d the way the OP is doing to his daughter. I wasn\u2019t an investment to be protected and kept secure. Just his daughter. He taught me how to cook, and change tires, how to use a table saw, how to cope with a broken heart, how to make the best out of bad situations, how to build a really cool snow fort\u2026.so much more. \n\nSo very fortunate to have grown up with two parents who treat me with infinite love and respect.", "This makes my heart swell for you! I wish more people could have that experience. \u2764"]}
