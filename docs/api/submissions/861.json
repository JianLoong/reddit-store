No one should ever accept an unwanted gift of a pet just to be polite.", "NTA. Live animals should not be given as gifts ever. Your lease does not allow pets.

I do love hamsters but you never gift someone a living animal that needs to be cared for without their permission.", "Hamsters are terrible pets, but putting that aside, but unless you know for certain that someone wants an animal in their home, it is extremely rude to force a pet on someone as a \u201cgift.\u201d NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
