I, 44 Fwas assigned \" coral\" as my color, and picked out a fancy Calvin Klein dress in coral. It's called the Starburst dress and it's a satin type material. She wanted me to try it on the other day and has now decided it's not motherly enough and wants me to wear this ugly chiffon pantsuit. I told her I'm fine with what I got, and I'm not sure precisely what the issue is with my dress. I offered to wear a shawl if my shoulders showing is the issue, but she said no it's too \" sexy\" period, and I need to look like a mother, and dress my age. I told her she is being ridiculous and I would rather just not go. Now she is all mad and my son is upset and trying to mediate.

Very clean, elegant, classic. MORE than appropriate for someone who\u2019s mid 40s. Your future DIL\u2019s comment about dressing your age? Yeah\u2026 I\u2019m guessing her mom is older than you and she\u2019s trying to make you look frumpy. \n\nNTA. Tell your son that the outfit his bride chose is something that a ~~70 yo~~ *geriatric person with little to no sense of style* would choose. You\u2019re 44. You have chosen a very appropriate dress, and will not be wearing the pantsuit monstrosity. \n\nMaybe ask your son what the *real* issue is.

It has gathers/tucks/pleats at the hip/waist that create a wide starburst of about six pleats from shoulder to low hip. It\u2019s very business tidy, and not sexy at all.\n\nSo this means\u2026 the OP must look DAMN HOT to carry it and look sexy.\n\nAnd DIL wants her in a floaty chiffon 60yr olds outfit of many layers and basically designed for woman with a broad spread.\n\nAhahaha. This means OP looks really hot and DIL is sour because she doesn\u2019t want a hot looking MIL.\n\nLet DIL buy the chiffon outfit. ~~Give it to your mother to wear (groom\u2019s grandmother)~~. Wear the CK dress. Everyone wins! EDIT: Someone has rightly pointed out that the grooms grandmother deserves better. **Update is to offer it to the brides mother**. That should sort the entire matter out, either she wears it, or she recoils in horror. Problem solved.", "Uhhh. The Golden Girls called and want their pantsuit back. NTA.", "I'm almost the same age as you and I'd honestly be furious if someone told me that I needed to dress more \"motherly\" and especially if they tried to force me to wear the hideous outfit that your FDIL is trying to make you wear.

I'm pretty sure a decent tailor could turn it into a sexy jumpsuit.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThat pantsuit is hideous.  \n\nTalk to your son.

Your future DIL\u2019s comment about dressing your ages is frankly ridiculous it\u2019s not like you\u2019re trying to show up in hot pants and a crop top.\n\nThat pantsuit is honestly horrid. What did you do that she\u2019s trying to punish you like that?!", "NTA and now you know your DIL is jealous of you, I am so sorry. \n\nTalk to your son, don\u2019t blame or anything just state that you will not be dressing like the late Queen Mum, and if it\u2019s forced on you, you will bring 6 corgies and be at least 4 gin & tonics in before the vows even happen. \n\nShe may be reading Justnomil type drama stories and is seeing you as some kind of villain, start communicating now, hopefully you can eventually get over this nonsense and laugh about the time she tried to put you in geriatric drag.", "NTA. Your DIL assigning a colour to anyone other than the bridesmaids / groomsmen is already problematic enough; you're her fiance's parents, not props in a photo shoot. You should wear whatever makes you comfortable and happy. I'm honestly not sure where this trend of dictating a colour scheme or outfits to wedding guests came from (TikTok?). But it's incredibly rude and out of line and selfish couples who phrase this as anything other than optional need a reality check \n\nAnd then your DIL doubles down with those icky comments about \"dressing your age\" that feel really shaming and judgmental. DIL has serious issues and a heavy dose of main character syndrome. Your son is in for an interesting marriage if this is who he's marrying... Just saying. \n\nI do think refusing to attend the wedding because of this is a step too far. You want to be there for your son, right? If so, talk to him and have him discuss with his bride that parents are invited honoured guests, not props, and should be encouraged to wear what they want. Then find an outfit that makes you happy and show up. Keep smiling, have a good time, and if DIL chooses to cause a scene, that's on her.\n\nETA: I'm about your age (43) and actually own the starburst dress in purple. It's a chic dress that is not even a little bit inappropriate. IMHO if anything it's a bit too office/corporate for an evening wedding, but that is just personal taste. Your DIL is totally in the wrong for trying to shame you for wearing it, especially since you were making an effort to accommodate her colour scheme. I also would be horrified to wear that pantsuit. I think even my mom in her 70s would find it old looking.\n\nETA #2: And yes, I'm aware of how weddings work. I actually got married just last year. Some trends popular with today's GenZ couples are completely disrespectful to guests, and this toxic wedding attitude of \"it's your day so you can do whatever you want\" is just plain inconsiderate. Your DIL needs to get over herself.", "You\u2019re 44, how is this ancient pink monstrosity age-appropriate for you?!!! NTA! Sincerely, a 28 year old.", "40 year old here. i'd rather jump from a cliff than wearing that ugly pantsuit thing. who even designed that. no matter the age, its just ugly. \n\ni really dont know, what the brides problem is, but its most likely rooted in her own insecurity. \ni'd talk to your son about it. try to make a step towards her, but also make clear that you wont wear that pink thing.", "NTA and as someone who is about to turn 40 I find that outfit offensive \ud83e\udd23\n\nBuy it, put it aside and gift it to her for her 44th birthday.", "NTA\n\nAs long as you aren't wearing white and your dress is appropriate, NTA to tell your DIL no thank you.", "NTA. You are 44 not 85. Geezz. You could just say ok and wear what you want. That 23 year old kid is still gonna cry either way.", "NTA, I\u2019m old enough to almost be your Mom and you wouldn\u2019t catch me wearing that.

That dress you chose is gorgeous and perfect for your age.", "She doesn\u2019t like you lol", "NTA Maybe I'm weird but I do not remember even once being concerned or even wondering what my MIL was going to wear, let alone assigning a color and picking the outfit out for her.", "I am 10 years your senior with a bit of flab and you wouldn't caught me dead wearing that attrocity of a pantsuit.

Congrats on being such a fox that people think a regular sheath dress is too sexy on you.  NTA.\n   \nI am a couple years younger and I'd totally wear the CK dress and never wear the chiffon thing.", "NTA. Tell her she is practicing ageism!  I'm almost 70 and I would wear that Calvin Klein dress in a heartbeat. You'd have to bury me in the chiffon to make me wear it and then I would come back and haunt you!", "NTA, in no universe is the chiffon thing \"coral,\" and if you're not a bridesmaid or groomsman, the Happy Couple don't get to pick out your outfit. They can veto your choice if you want to wear something that is inappropriate for the event and request a specific color, and that's it.\n\nCan we see the dress?", "NTA\n\nYou found a dress you liked in the color that she picked. As long as it's not bridal and it's fitting for the occasion, then you should be good.

Is DIL conservative in dressing and mannerisms? \n\nEdited.", "NTA. You took the color assigned and found a dress - which, if I found the right one on Google, looks lovely. But her reasons (too sexy, you don\u2019t look motherly enough and you need to \u201cdress your age\u201d) feel strange. Maybe have a chat with DIL-to-be and your son?", "Nta\nNever been to a wedding where the bride chose the mother in law or mother's outfits.\nThis level of control is concerning and toxic.\nYour dress you chose is lovely and appropriate.", "NTA\n\nI just looked up the CK dress and it is not overtly sexy. Maybe offer to wear a shawl or something. It looks very similar to the dress my mom wore to my sisters wedding and she looked lovely. You\u2019re 44 not 74, that outfit is about 30 years too old for you. \n\nIt\u2019s also really weird that your DIL is jealous of how you look. I can understand being jealous of a MIL, I experience it sometimes, but it\u2019s never about how sexy she looks.", "NTA that pantsuit almost made me vomit from the look of it, it\u2019s obvious your dil is just worried you might upstage her", "NTA. That pantsuit looks like something my grandmother would wear to a wedding. She\u2019s 89.", "NTA. Your future DIL is way off base and out of line with this! I looked up the Calvin Klein dress and that\u2019s a perfect style and cut for someone who\u2019s 44, and definitely appropriate for a wedding. If she wanted you to wear a shawl, or something longer I guess that would be fine but still unnecessary. However, this outfit she\u2019s suggesting is so insulting! That is what senior citizens wear to a wedding, that is Grandma gear.", "NTA. I'm in my 60s, and I wouldn't wear that hideous thing, lol. The kids need to decide if this is a hill that they're willing to die on.", "Omg NTA, you\u2019re 44 not 144 lol. That is not appropriate for your age. 44 is still young. Dress codes at weddings is one thing but you would think your DIL would want you to feel comfortable, confident and beautiful too.", "NTA.\n\nGood grief you're younger than I am and there is no way I'd wear that thing! Stand your ground. That outfit is dreadful.", "NTA - Does she want you to look like Blanche from the Golden Girls? That was my first thought when I saw the pantsuit. It looks like something a senior would\u2019ve worn in the 80\u2019s! I looked up the Calvin Klein dress and it looks very similar to what my sister wore to her son\u2019s wedding, except hers was a pale pink. If your FDIL didn\u2019t want you to stand out at the wedding, she shouldn\u2019t have assigned such a bright colour to you! Are the bridesmaids in super bright colours as well?", "NTA. A much as I love golden girls, I wouldn't want to dress as one.", "Jesus.  You're only 44.  Why are you only allowed to be frumpy at the wedding? That pant suit is awful and there is no one I love enough to wear that.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with the CK dress.  It is not sexy or anything like that.  It would be a lovely dress to wear to a wedding.", "NTA.  The dress you bought is a nice sheath.  Not a \u201csexy\u201d dress.  That pantsuit is a hate crime.", "So the dress is too sexy but the vagina blouse is fine? NTA.", "Nta. Forget tasteful vs frumpy, since when does the bride choose the mother of the grooms clothes? \n\nQDil is either a complete control freak and you should be talking to your son about the life that leads to for him or there are other reasons. The top 3 I can think of are Dil thinks you'll outshine her, dil is trying to make your son choose her over you in some weird power flex or possibly dil is concerned how her own mother will look next to you. \n\nYou need to ask for her real reasoning and if sexy v frumpy remains her reason ask her why you aren't allowed to feel good on the day you welcome her into your family.", "NTA! I haven't seen what the CK dress looks like. She calls it too sexy, but then wants you to wear something that looks like labia majora?!", "\u201cDress my age\u201d WTF you\u2019re only 44?!?! It sounds like the original dress you got was perfect for your age. That pantsuit is made for women in their 60s/70s. I would have never told anyone what they should wear at my wedding. NTA", "NTA. The pantsuit is ugly. You picked a lovely dress on the assigned colour, end of story. Wear it to the wedding and ignore DiL.", "NTA. I\u2019ve just googled the dress you mentioned that you chose, and I really don\u2019t see an issue with it? \nThe pantsuit is too old for a 44 year old. \nI think your DIL may be insecure.", "Definitely NTA.  Either she has terrible taste in fashion or she's just jealous and insecure you're going to look stunning. I say stand your ground and don't let her force you to wear that hideous dress.", "NTA. I can only assume DIL doesn\u2019t like you very much to insist that you wear that monstrosity. The starburst dress is perfect!", "NTA. \n\nCouples getting married can set dress codes for guests, and specific dresses and suits for the wedding party. When picking specific dresses (or whatever), the couple becomes an AH if they pick a dress that makes it very difficult for certain body types (aka a dress where you cannot wear a bra at all, very short, very sheer) or for people to feel comfortable.\n\nWhen it is only one person that needs to wear the outfit- like a mother of the groom- then it should be a joint decision, where mostly the couple picks a color and dress code plus important details (cocktail, nothing strapless, flower patterns, no sparkle, etc). \n\nHer telling you that you must wear this one thing is not okay. I looked up the dress you mention, and it is very modest, like it would be appropriate for a corporate work meeting. \n\nMy only suggestion is to speak to your son directly and tell him you are happy to find a compromise, but you won't be wearing that pantsuit and that comments about \"dressing your age\" are offensive. We shouldn't be telling anyone what age or parenthood should look like (besides covering the bits and dressing to a dress code). If you want to look around and find an option or two that work for you in that color, you can include them in the conversation. Be clear to your son you are going to him because he is your son, and therefore you are his problem to deal with. If he then wants to discuss with the 3 of you all together, that's fine, but then just repeat that deciding what a mother/certain age should dress like is offensive.", "NTA. Youre only 44 why would she want you to look like her grandmother??", "NTA - but is this some sort of guerilla marketing campaign for CK because now I want to buy that Starburst dress.

NTA this would be my hill to die on.", "NTA! She needs to calm down, wow. 44 is not old and you do not need to \"grandma it up\" for her to make her feel better about herself. It's not like you were planning on dressing in white stealing the bride's thunder.. you're already going with the color they assigned you, I think it's more than reasonable to have you choose what you feel comfortable in within the color they picked", "So crazy that some brides act like a wedding is like a movie production and the extras need to dress their parts for her.", "NTA. That is FOUL. You are in your 40s, not your 90s. She sounds insecure.", "I gotta wonder if OP is in great shape for her age (44 isn\u2019t even old, wtf?) and DIL is harboring some insecurities.

It is a bit alarming about how controlling she\u2019s being about the whole thing. It\u2019s one thing to dislike a dress, but to not only insist that you wear something that\u2026ugly, but also throw a tantrum when you don\u2019t\u2026wow!

In fact the first thought I had was that it looks like something the therapist from Lucifer would wear!", "NTA. That's the most atrocious pantsuit I've seen.

What's the logic here?", "NTA\n\nI'm in my 60s and fat and I wouldn't wear that pantsuit. Too flowy and grandmotherly.\n\nBut regardless, you are the groom's mother.

She\u2019d hate that chiffon suit. FDIL should do one.", "I'm 39 too. I certainly don't feel \"old\" yet either, haha. I regularly get carded buying wine. I think the average 40 year old looks a lot younger than 20 year olds expect - you have to live a really unhealthy lifestyle to age more rapidly.", "I'm turning 50 next year and I own and wear that dress. \n\nIt's awesome and I love it. The gathers hide a lot. It's not skin tight and the neckline is comfortably high.", "Yep. Definitely  reminiscent of Dorothy.\n\nI just can\u2019t imagine dictating to my future MIL that she wear a particular thing to my wedding. I guess I would politely tell her it\u2019s NMS and wear what I had planned.", "I would purchase that outfit and give it to DIL on her 40th bday. \n\nAs a 39 and 3/4 year old woman I literally shuddered. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to cosplay being 1 million years old because she\u2019s insecure. \n\nNTA all day.", "I would suggest to GDIL that DIL should wear the same outfit she want OP to wear since it's so \"motherly\"", "To further corroborate your comment, I asked my grandma (95 years old) what she thought about the pantsuit.\nAnswer, verbatim: '' If this is cool style for 40 year olds today, you're all fucked. ''\n\nI love that woman.", "I have a sneaking suspicion that wasn't a spelling mistake. :))))))))", "I was going to say the same! I\u2019m 38 and would rock that pantsuit any day! All the pink and frillies lol", "I'm in 50's and I think I'd wear the pantsuit, I quite like it and for my (non) figure, it would work for me!  I like the CK dress, and think the bride trying to make OP wear the pantsuit is wrong. OP should wear the dress and tell bride to stay in her lane.", "Im 25 and love that pantsuit!!! (I'd prefer a different color as I lean more towards dark colors) but still!!!", "Yeah I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s so terrible! I certainly don\u2019t agree with the bride trying to force OP to wear it if she doesn\u2019t like it - but this is a beautiful color imo. It is definitely a cut my 80yo grandma would wear though lol. In fact I might just send her a screenshot. She\u2019ll love the color too! Haha", "I hate the colour, but in a less flashy colour like navy or a nice darker green I think it would be a nice Outfit for that season. Light enough to not get sweaty AF and still something over the arms, that you won't get cold so fast.", "It would be Post _insert #here_ or the American Leagion club in America. Also, for the non Aussies, what is a pokie, and why is it banging in the backroom? You're not implying a bunch of 80 yr Olds are doing the horizontal hula at the Vets club, are you?", "Exactly\u2026. Moisturizer is your friend \ud83d\ude02", "I just want to know if you\u2019re a Rose, Dorothy, Sophia, or Blanch because your future DIL is clearly trying to turn you into a Golden Girl! :) \n\nThe CK dress is perfectly acceptable and absolutely modest enough for a wedding.", "Bwahahhaa. Imagine all that chiffon sliding\u2026 horizontally!   \n\n\nNo. Gasp and clutch my pearls.   \n\n\nA pokie is a poker machine. One armed bandit. Gambling machine. HOrrible things, loads of clanging noise and useless lights. Banned thankfully in my home state (WA, except for at the one solitary casino), but prevalent in the ever breeding thousands up and down the east coast of Australia.", "Hasnt even Stacy fucking London denounced the idea of \"dressing ones age\"", "Hahah that was my first thought! It\u2019s not only an old lady outfit, it\u2019s an old lady outfit from the 1980s!", "OP already did the \"motherly\" character. Her son is grown now she's allowed to not be \"motherly\" if she wasn't to. NTA and FDIL sounds insecure AF. \n\nWear the dress you picked out OP! Maybe ask your son to back you up because his fiance is being unreasonable and he better make sure this behavior is what he really wants to hitch himself to.", "I\u2019m 4 years older than OP and no way in hell would I wear that monstrosity! And I have been in my Mrs. Roper era for a decade!", "The pant suit looks like something worn by Dorthy on Golden Girls while Blanch is roasting her for wearing it.", "FDIL still has to be a part of the family by the time she hits 44. \ud83e\udd27", "It absolutely is coral, if you click on the Coral color dot that's already highlighted. The color that loads by default is not coral. :)", "That's a completely nice, plainish dress that covers everything and is certainly not overtly sexy or 'young'. MIL is 44 not 88\nI was expecting some low cut, backless number with a thigh split.", "Be fair QEII wouldn't wear that. She tended to wear solid colours so she could be seen but beautifully tailored. Google Queen Elizabeth chiffon dress! But NTA", "I can\u2019t un-see labia. Angry upvote.", "She could also go Phyllis Nefler and get it altered to be much more flattering. Make the jacket a detachable sheath and make the top a loose camisole, bottoms 7/8 length, and wear heels.", "that tripped me out too - the color isnt even right. and im a colorblind 35yo male...", "That is definitely something they would have put Dorothy in, and I didn't like any of those outfits on her! I didn't think it was fair they dressed her like that just because she was so tall.", "I'm betting DIL's mother is much older. Granted, my mom was 54 when I got married and she still wouldn't wear that outfit", "I still only feel like I'm in my 20s and I'm 43. It comes around so quickly.", "Hahaha everyone should be this chill about their wedding.", "This is something my 87 year old oma would wear, not my mother or any of my aunts \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m 60 and wouldn\u2019t wear it if you strangled me.", "Plus it would only work if two more people were also cosplaying as a member of the golden girls.", "Why is there such a big deal about what other people wear to a wedding? I get that wearing white would be  tacky, but must the BRIDE dictate what everyone is wearing?", "My mother would wear that. She hates her arms and would love something flowy that covers them. In fact my MIL just wore something life this to my nieces wedding last week, except it was more boat neck and the front wasn't open. Like a long flowy cape. Both are in their 70s.... This is definitely a retirement age outfit. 44 though? Lol No way in hell!", "My grandma would probably like it. She\u2019s in her 80s though.  \nI don\u2019t care what the occasion is. I wouldn\u2019t step outside in that.", "The paint suit is like from a comedy show for silly giggly mother in law.  DIL is definitely insecure.", "You DARE question the fashions of Blanche Devereaux?!", "I wouldn\u2019t get caught dead in it either. I mean I\u2019m a guy so I don\u2019t wear dresses\u2026 but if I did this would definitely not be one of them.", "You can send her a gift even if she isn't.", "NTA! Oh my God\u2026 Hard no. Bad enough in pink but in the coral it\u2019s absolutely atrocious.", "Yup. Lots of flowy drapes. I looked up the starburst dress. It\u2019s fitted, but shoulders to knees. Nothing a younger mom can\u2019t wear.", "My friend is 40 and she\u2019s expecting a baby lol. WTF. That girl thinks 40 year olds a belong in a nursing home or something \ud83d\ude02", "That dress is the most universally appropriate dress I think I've ever seen.", "I could see Blanche in that as loungewear, perhaps, but Dorothy needs a thicker material...", "That pantsuit screams Blanche", "Just saw your comment.  I totally thought it was something you\u2019d see on the Golden Girls!  Great show btw but that pantsuit is a big NO!", "Agree.  I was thinking someone's great grandma.  Absolutely not the mother of the groom", "nah, we have no evidence that the MOB deserves that. She might be a perfectly nice person.", "Now, that\u2019s an idea. Accept the pantsuit excitedly, while exclaiming, \u201coh, fun, I didn\u2019t realize you were having a costume party wedding!\u201d. Then show up dressed as Blanche (wearing the Starburst dress, of course) with three of your friends dressed as Dorothy (in the pantsuit), Sophia, and Rose.", "I was gonna say, \u201cDorothy wants her pantsuit back.\u201d", "We\u2019ve stumbled on the solution. OP, have the groom\u2019s father wear it.", "Found the coral one: https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/calvin-klein-starburst-sleeveless-sheath-dress-dresses-women-macys--130674826666690530/", ">He just wore a navy blue suit...but had it monogrammed to say \"father of the groom\" except that the shop made a spelling mistake and it said \"farter\" instead of \"father\", which led to more laughing.\n\n1) I am 110% certain that this was intentional.\n\n2) That is fucking hilarious.", "Yeah that's probably true. Though my mom was mostly worried about looking like she has a double chin in photos than anything else. I gave her some posing tips and cued our photographer to do the same, and she looked lovely.", "It's a really nice, classy looking dress. Seems like it would look good on most ages and body types because it's kind of a classic look to me. The pink pantsuit on the other hand...no comment, lol.", "I like shandys... and grapefruit raddlers are delicious", "Me too :) It's a little too apropos.", "To be fair, English isn't the first language here, so it's possible it was a mistake. But when I saw it I spit beer out my nose. Totally worth it.", "A slot machine?!?! Lol", "Thank you for clarifying. I had a completely different picture in my head when I read that LOL.", "Right?! I'm 40, I'd wear the CK in a heartbeat, and I'd only wear the pantsuit if I were cosplaying as a Golden Girl.\n\nAlso, my MIL wore a hot pink, long cocktail dress to my wedding. Yes, it was bright. She looked amazing, and still, there was no way she outshone me. \n\nOP is NTA. Unless the wedding is Golden Girls themed.", "She is going to have a major crisis in about 15 years if she doesn't get over this self-image based on youth. I know at least two ex-coworkers who were super obsessed with their relative youth all the time and who aren't handling being in their late 30s that well.", "[https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/calvin-klein-starburst-sleeveless-sheath-dress-dresses-women-macys--130674826666690530/](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/calvin-klein-starburst-sleeveless-sheath-dress-dresses-women-macys--130674826666690530/)\n\nimo very tasteful for a MOG dress for a late summer/early fall wedding", "NTA\n\nI'm in my 70's and I wouldn't be caught dead in that pantsuit monstrosity.\n\nIt might be  appropriate for a Mardi Gras Carnival, if you are in a parade, but not for a wedding.", "That mother of the bride outfit was something mothers or grandmothers might have worn 40years ago to a wedding. Being a mother of a grown child in this era no longer means you have to be frumpy. Some are, and some look great. My guess is OP\u2018s dil doesn\u2019t want anyone to tell OP from dils side of the family she looks great for having a grown son ( since obviously OPs side knows what she looks like already). This tells me dil or dil\u2019s mom does not look so great. Either way dil is ridiculous trying to frumpify her mil. Not a great start to a relationship", "> DIL must think people just become elderly when they turn 40?\n\nAgreed. It's ridiculous that people try to impose their stupid opinions on us. Clothes don't have an age limit.", "I showed my teenager the outfit with no context and they immediately said, \"Momma! Please don't ever wear old lady clothes like that unironically.\"", "Basically she wants OP to look matronly and unbecoming, but I don't blame anyone for not wanting to wear this getup. This post reminds me why I want to elope! Big weddings are too much drama.", "Dude, she's only 9 years older than me and the bride wants her to wear....that ?", "Same. Also, can you imagine eating, using the bathroom and dancing with all that shit(ff)on. No way.", "I doubt your opinion would change, That pantsuit is designed to make the big look bigger and the obese to look like a mountain. It is made to hide the body and looks like it comes from a country where women's bodies are not allowed to be seen. \n\nOP's DIL must hate her.", "Yes! Someone could alter the top so it's just as form-fitting as the CK dress, add the right eye-catching jewelry to accentuate her shape, and lose the chiffon jacket. Done right it could be even sexier than the dress.", "My thought exactly.  Also, this is why people shouldn\u2019t contemplate getting married before their brain is fully developed.  She\u2019s acting like a jealous idiot.", "Not beaded/blinged out enough for Blanche.", "I mean my grandmother at 90 would\u2019ve maybe *considered* this, but for the price you know that fit is likely to be off and the fabric quality unlikely to be nice, and she never would\u2019ve worn this *and* compromised on fit and quality.\n\nI know my other grandmother who is 95 rn would honest to god roast anyone in our family for wearing this and would no way in hell put it on her body.", "You probably like pineapple on your pizza too.
