It's their chance to say \"we raised this boy into a young man, he's found a suitable partner, and we are celebrating their first steps into adulthood as their own family unit\".\n\nThe parents plan and pay for everything in India. They buy the gifts for the hundred of relatives on each side. They choose the food and the venue and the entertainment. The bride and groom choose their clothes and jewelry, and provide input if they feel very strongly about something. But it's not about the couple, it's about the whole family. \n\nAs an example, at my wedding, I received a gift that the faculty at my uncle's University had pooled money for. They gave a gift for their boss's \"American\" niece because it's a big event in *his* family. And this is *completely normal*, because weddings are about family.\n\nAlso, there won't be 1,000 people at each event. The big crowd will be there for dinner and to give gifts (and cash), and then they will probably leave. The religious ceremony is usually smaller. All the pre-wedding ceremonies will be for relatives and close family friends, and are more casual and homey. \n\nThis isn't a religious thing. Muslim wedding in India are just as lavish as Hindu ones. It's about the culture and the family bonding, not the specific rituals.\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed, talk to your fiancee about toning down the pre-wedding rituals. Depending on how religious the family is, a lot of it might not even be about you, it will just be a lot of invoking of Gods and ancestors to bless the wedding itself. Aside from my haldi ceremony, I just did a lot of sitting and watching while my aunts and uncles got to do all the fun stuff.\n\nPlus, you'll be the \"American daughter-in-law\". Hospitality is one of the highest virtues in India, so they will do their best to make you feel welcome and not intimidated. Your fiance needs to run interference with his family to make.sure your comfortable and not overwhelmed. That's his job as your future husband", "Hi OP, I think your fiance wanting a Indian wedding has little to do with religion and more with culture (large families etc). The 1000 guest list is not too much by Indian Delhi standards - the big Indian wedding is indeed true!\n\nHowever, your discomfort with rituals and guest list (etc) is understandable if you don't belong to the same culture. You are right to feel anxious. On the other hand, he might feel the same about a smaller wedding, I think. The best is for you both to talk and reach a middle ground depending on your comfort levels. Negotiate and compromise from both sides.\n\nNAH.", "NAH, but you might want to find what other cultural expectations Raj has before you get married. What if you have children? What about his parents coming to stay in their retirement?", "You are not an asshole for not wanting such a big wedding and feeling anxious about it, your feelings are valid\n\nRaj is not an asshole for wanting his cultural and wedding traditions to be celebrated, his feelings are valid\n\nI can see your immediate feeling being panic and No, but it\u00b4s fair that both partners get a say here. You need to talk to Raj and say exactly the things about the ceremony that are a problem for you. I am assuming that you have never been to a wedding in India, you might have an idea that isn\u00b4t correct in real life. Or it could be something that could be modified to suit you better. You don\u00b4t know unless you really sit together and discuss it.\n\nNAH", "religion may not matter to your BF but culture does. over a thousand people sounds extremely overwhelming there has to be a compromise but Indian weddings tend to be huge.", "NAH but it's time for a *huge* conversation regarding cultural norms.\n\nWhat you're describing is absolutely what would be expected in traditional Indian culture. I've had friends go through the same thing despite being deeply, deeply atheist simply to make their parents happy.\n\nYou absolutely don't have to do this (I wouldn't in your position) but understand from their perspective you're essentially dismissing what they and their family have been doing for hundreds of years.", "NAH yet but you're both on a dangerous path. It's not a good sign that you're just discovering each other's culture now. This all should have been discussed at length before getting engaged. The wedding is only a tiny part of it. There's a lifetime of family relationships, celebrations, cultural practices and expectations ahead. Marrying across cultures is a lot of work and you clearly haven't done it. Pause everything and get talking.", "Hi OP, as an Indian woman myself, I would like to point out that if you\u2019re marrying to an Indian guy, you are marrying his entire family, and all the cultural baggage that comes with it.\n\nIndians are very big on their rituals and family relationships (near or far) and you will be expected to make a lot of compromises and adjust within the family. Family members will often pay you a visit and it would be considered extremely rude if you, as the \u201cDIL\u201d to not cater to them according to their expectations.\n\nDon\u2019t fall for the \u201cbut my fiance isn\u2019t like that\u201d. Majority of Indian men are family pleasing men, so don\u2019t be surprised if he does expect/hope for you to give in often.\n\nBe very, VERY, sure about marrying into an Indian family!", "NAH at this point, but you need to find a compromise. It\u2019s fairly typical for Indians in the US to have a US wedding ceremony and a separate Indian wedding ceremony, and you\u2019re going to need to find a way to be comfortable with big family events unless you expect Raj to cut off contact with his family entirely. You also seem to be conflating some aspects of secular Indian wedding culture (henna painting) with religious aspects. Other rituals may be rooted in religion, but are also culturally significant in a secular context. If you look into the history of secular US wedding traditions, most are rooted in historic religious practices as well.", "NAH. It\u2019s not just your wedding, it\u2019s his as well. They aren\u2019t asking you to plan the 2nd wedding, they just want to have a second wedding in their home city. \n\nIdk if you\u2019re originally from DC, but seems like Raj is originally from Delhi, and he surely has people he\u2019s close to in the city. Just like how you\u2019d want to include those closest to you, I\u2019m sure he does too. Even if it\u2019s not the case, learn to compromise.\n\nIdk if you\u2019re Indian, but even if you are, If you\u2019re not going to accept that he is going to want to do things according to his culture (or how his family usually does things) and compromise, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be with each other.", "NAH\n\nThis is something you guys probably should have talked about before getting engaged. I can\u2019t imagine how the compromise is going to look.", "NAH. \n\nI also despise the idea of a large wedding. When I was with my ex, I flat out refused. His justification for a huge wedding was just that it was what some people he had known growing up had done. And he thought it was nice to have 100+ people, and an open door policy. In the end we just didn't have a wedding at all. \n\nI am currently dating a Muslim guy (he's not very religious, but his parents are), and would definitely consider a big wedding (if he asked), because it matters to him and his culture.\n\nYou don't want to compromise your desires for a wedding, but the only way you can do that is by him not getting what he wants at all. You're definitely not an AH for being uncomfortable, but by deciding alone that it's not happening, you're not really being fair to him.", "Your not the asshole for wanting something for your wedding. \n\nYour boyfriend is not the asshole for wanting something else for your wedding. \n\nThis may be the time you learn to compromise with one another.", "I can totally understand why you might find this big Hindu overwhelming, but I think saying a flat no to the whole thing isn't the right thing to do. There has to be a compromise by either scaling down the guest list or leaving out some of the  elements that you really don't feel happy with. If you just say no to the whole thing it's going to upset your partner and his family and that's not a great way to start a marriage.  Plus, as you live in DC you're not going to have to be involved in these kinds of events very often.  It's just a one off and they're paying. It might even be fun. It's flattering that they want to welcome you into the family this way. NAH.", "NTA Raj knows exactly how you feel about it, and is still pushing for it anyway. The wedding is for you two, not his family. If he does not like that you do not want to have the big Indian wedding, then he should have thought about that before proposing to you. This might be the end of the relationship though, because it sounds like he cares more about pleasing his family than he does about your feelings.", "NAH\n\nYOu need to compromise.\n\n> big wedding with people I dont know and things i feel uncomfortable with\n\nThat's fucking terrible. A 1000 people? Don't do it. Don't say no to the wedding as a whole, but do talk them down from this. You're going to be regretting everything by the end of this\n\nIt's got less to do with religion than with cultural expectations. Sort of in the way you can have an atheist wedding with a white dress and a ring but with no Christianity involved. And I bet it doesn't help that other people his parents see who're having a cross cultural wedding have two ceremonies. But no one ever said there needed to be a 1000 people there", "NAH. Your views are both valid. If you are marrying him, you are marrying into a family and culture. It seems that a big Hindu wedding is important for his family and culture (it seems to be less about religion, but I could be wrong). \n\nI get that it would be overwhelming to be the centre of attention at such a big event, but you are being welcomed into their family, and in doing so, paving the way for a more harmonious life with that family.", "NTA but please understand that over 1000 people, at Indian wedding, is not considered excessive. It is important for you to have a wedding you are comfortable with but have you discussed this in detail with your fianc\u00e9? Do you agree on a way forward, not just about the wedding but children and other life events that are important in his culture.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding and it seems like Raj\u2019s parents want THEIR dream wedding (again?). \n\nIf it was important to your fianc\u00e9 then maybe but he seems to be just going along with what his parents want. It\u2019s not selfish to not want a religious wedding if you\u2019re not religious.", "NTA\n\n> they would prefer alongside the small secular wedding we were planning to also have a full blow out Indian wedding \n\nOh, THEY would prefer ...\n\n> Raj said I was being extremly unaccomdating by straught saying no and that it was important to him to have his family there and the events for his culture.\n\nYou need to sit down with Raj and have a VERY serious conversation about your life together.  This is not just about the wedding, it's about all the things that are part of his culture and you're expected to fall in line.  Don't wait till later, have that talk ASAP - this is for the REST OF YOUR LIFE.", "No dear, you aren't the AH but how much do you know about his culture and customs? I would find out how traditional he is and what he expects in a marriage...it could be TOO much in a traditional aspect if you catch my meaning", "NTA - This is your wedding not theirs.  Don't let them pressure you into ruining your big day.", "You do you girl,\n\nRaj can take a cardboard cut out with him to Delhi\n\nLive life by your values, not those imposed upon you by people\n\nthat just try to impress people", "NTA", "NTA.  You each have every right to your own preferences for your wedding.  You guys want different things.  Having an opinion on what you want for your wedding does not make you an asshole.", "Dump OP Raj, it's only the beginning of her control Raj lol", "NTA.  Weddings require two approvals.  Either can veto.  Raj seems on board until his parents tell him otherwise.  It seems disingenuous to have a religious ceremony when neither practices the religion.  This could be a bad shape of things to come.  What other religious activities will Ram\u2019s parents expect? Will Raj often crumble?  Are you sure this is the marriage you want to be a part of - you, Raj, his waffling, and his parent\u2019s expectation?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Indian weddings are rooted in culture more than religion. Plus it's more of a family thing than just the couples union. 1000 in attendance is actually normal for Indian weddings. The issue here is cultural differences. I understand your anxiety about being in such a big event. You guys need to communicate about your feelings and understand where everyone is coming from.", "NTA but if you marry him you will be forced into all of his family customs which will likely mean they will come live with you at some point or at least come for very long \"visits\".  I am someone who likes their space and quiet so it wouldn't work for me but perhaps you are able to get over your introverted spirit and be okay with constant intrusion. It's fine if that's how you were raised but if you weren't that's a very hard situation to deal with IMO.", "NAH. You wouldn't be doing double the wedding work - Raj's parents will likely dictate every aspect of the Indian one; you would just be shuffled around and told what to do. However, it's not religious although it's rooted in religion (just like a Western wedding) - it's cultural, so if that's the issue, you could probably ignore the discomfort if it's from that. USians have a lot of trouble understanding that some cultures have religion baked into them as a default and it's not in the weird 'Catholic guilt' way it's done in the US. It is what it is - call it customs, but it's hard-rooted into some people's brains and weaved into everyday life in a way that is separate from any practicing religious notions. If he were Muslim or Coptic or a passive part of any culture with a huge wedding custom (all of them?), you'd get the same \"we need to go through the motions or the neighbors will talk\" song-and-dance.\n\nNot going to lie, it sounds like you know this because I can't imagine you're this out of touch with your partner's culture after being together for 2 yrs or that he hasn't explained this to you & you're choosing to ignore it so it can be a 'nope' point.\n\nHowever, I do see where you're coming from. It's your wedding, too, and you shouldn't have to be married twice, if once will do. Then again, it's Raj's wedding, too, and you use a lot of 'I' statements in your posts without even mentioning how to meet in the middle. I do suggest you consider cultural value to Raj and Raj's parents, the fact that getting a visa for the Indian nationals to come to a wedding in the US is not timely and it's far more expensive than your US friends going to India...which they don't need to since you will get two weddings.", "YTA\n\nHow are you about to marry an Indian man, yet know nothing about his culture? Just bcs you aren\u2019t religious doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t follow tradition, and in India weddings are a huge deal that involve the whole family and community. You are disrespecting that.

Everyone I\u2019ve known who has married into this culture has had two weddings, and the Indian wedding was a huge blow out.", "This needs to be higher - I don't understand how you haven't discussed these issues.

Why is she the only person who's entitled to the wedding she wants? It's not just about his parents - OP admits he said it was important for him culturally.

People don\u2019t say things like \u201cI expect family to only come 1-2x year and only for a few days at a time\u201d or \u201cI expect my mother to move in for the first 3-6 months after our child is born\u201d because it would never occur to you that they\u2019d do anything else. Then when a clash occurs the couple is standing there, both of them blindsided and frustrated, because they can\u2019t for the life of them figure out why the other is making such a fuss about something so \u201cordinary\u201d.", "I totally understand where you're coming from because I've personally dealt with this clash. The problem they'll run into is that the family feel just as firmly that they are in the right. In other words, why is OP and her American perspective more \"right\" than the family's Indian perspective? it's not the same as American parents doing this - manipulation and cultural norms are not necessarily synonymous. It's hard to get when you have such a western perspective.", "I'm on the fence between Y T A and N A H, but this line tipped it over for me, \"I dont see the need for such a big wedding especially away from all our friends who are in America with us.\"\n\nYOUR friends may all in America, but clearly there are a lot of people he cares about and wants at his wedding who are in India. This isn't just your wedding, it's his wedding too.\n\nIf there are elements of the wedding you're not comfortable with then you can talk with him and maybe there is a compromise that can be reached, and I don't think you should be in charge of planning it, but you should not flat out dismiss something that's clearly important to your partner without discussion like that. YTA", "Look, as a person from a similar background, you have to realize that weddings, culturally, are more about the families than the couple. I dislike it too, but in such cultures, the families will be the ones who are effected greatly by how it goes, which is unfair but true and we can\u2019t change that in one generation or two. You are marrying into the family, their culture and social life is at stakes here. Now i\u2019m not particularly indian not Hindi, but that\u2019s how it goes in my culture and that\u2019s how I presume it goes in many Indian cultures too.", "Technically NTA. But if your fiance wants to do it (STOP, it doesnt matter that the parents came up with the idea, he told you he wants to do it), then do it. ITs not like the \"religeous aspects can do any harm to you, you yourself said your an atheist so at best everything they are doing is esentially just pretend. Imagine taking a vacation to an exotic location and visiting a religeious location not because youre religeous, but for the historical aspect.  Like visiting the Taj Mahal in India or Say the Sistine Chapel to see the art of Michelangelo. Just think of this as a submersive tour of an authentic indian wedding and a great way to bond with your inlaws and could actually bring you closer to your partner for not only supporting them but also for giving you more connection.", "NAH, but I think you need to have a talk and either compromise or decide if this is the hill one of you wants to die on", "Ok so yea this more like a cultural thing than a religious one. I know others have already said it but I have been to multiple Indian weddings, they are huge! Sometimes they go on for days, for me (an introvert) they are exhausting. I can\u2019t imagine actually being the bride at one. I attended one where they actually had two ceremonies. An Indian ceremony for the groom and later a Christian ceremony for the bride. \n\nAlso if you do decide to have an Indian wedding, I\u2019m sure his mom will assist with the planning.  Most of the moms do from what I\u2019ve seen. \n\nBut this is only if it is something you both agree to. It\u2019s not just his wedding or yours. It\u2019s for both of you. Take some time. Cool down and try to talk through both your concerns.  Good luck!\n\nNTA", "Just because his family is far away doesn't mean they aren't important to him. This is the biggest milestone in his life and the tradition is expected. It's important for him to maintain his family roots.", "The most important thing is that you're compfortable.  You're not.  Being the man you're going to spend the rest of your life with, Raj should understand this.  What he needs to do is explain to his family that this just isn't something EITHER of you want.  Make sure he doesn't try to put this all on you.  He didn't want it, & probably still doesn't but his family is insisting & he doesn't want to upset them.  But he seems fine with upsetting you.  The woman he's going to spend his life with.  He doesn't want to stand up to his family bc it's easier to just go along with them.  NTA.", "This would be an incredible opportunity and insight into your new husband's culture. It would not add to your work because you could just sit back and smile and enjoy. As a foreigner unfamiliar with their customs, they would only expect you to show up. \n\nAlthough I don't normally like being the center of attention, I would jump at a rare opportunity like this.", "NAH - but don't get married.  If you can't accommodate for your fianc\u00e9's culture a bit this early in the game I don't see great things for your marriage.", "Idk if you\u2019re originally from DC, but seems like Raj is originally from Delhi, and he surely has people he\u2019s close to in the city. Just like how you\u2019d want to include those closest to you, I\u2019m sure he does too. Even if it\u2019s not the case, learn to compromise.", "Yep, more communicating, less assuming.", "Stolen comment. Report the bot", "She definitely glossed over that by saying all of their friends are in dc. As if he never knew anyone while growing up.", "And she needs to also make her own cultural expectations clear and not assume they are any less extreme than his."]}
