Caaaaancel you plans with friends!  My heart is broken because the concept of having a prior engagement 4 days before your birthday is something I don't comprehend.\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nYour mother and grandmother are being unreasonable and (in a metaphorical sense, not diagnosing her) a touch narcissistic.

It is in no way shape or form disrespectful to make plans with someone-you're actually showing them respect by doing so bc that indicates you know they may be doing other things and you're willing to compromise on a time that works best for both of you.
