From an employer perspective my concerns would be threefold. Are the users finding the AI experience satisfactory to their needs? Is there any potential that this software involves elements that could potentially have been sourced from stolen intellectual property (voice AI concerns me as a lot of professionals in that field have found their voices already taken to build AI replicas without their consent), which could come back on the company? Lastly, is the AI actually providing accurate and reliable information to users? I would also question how it learns what to say, as most AI so far spend 48 hours with people and become raging fascists. Is it capable only of reciting information or can it do the level of problem solving required of most help desks? This will cycle back to the user experience question - can it evidence that it actually resolves problems in a way the end user is satisfied with? \n\nI can\u2019t begin to guess where AI will be in a year, but there are lots of concerns and reasons to be concerned. In the field of AI art there\u2019s a legal challenge underway and already AI work has been stripped of copyright protections. I think too much still has to be decided.

Yes the world is being automated. It's been the fear for decades that people will lose their jobs... Yet we've come so far and more people have jobs than they did in the 50s.\n\nIn my country this kind of progress is, in most businesses, handled by giving people new tasks. They then let the ones who quit or retire go without replacing them until they're the right amount of employees again. Sometimes they also give the older personell monetary incentives to retire. Of course this is in Norway though. Firing people is a big deal here and the last step. If you're in USA your fears could be reasonable for all I know.\n\nEither way.
