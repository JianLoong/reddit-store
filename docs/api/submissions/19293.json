Before meeting my husband, I grew up non-vegetarian, but I made the switch to vegetarian after we got together. My husband and his entire family are strict vegetarians.\n\nRecently, my mother-in-law came to stay with us to help out when the baby is born. Two days ago, she went out of her way to prepare a special meal for me and I truly appreciated her effort and the thoughtfulness behind it. I ate everything she had made and complimented her cooking.\n\nHowever, throughout the entire meal, I couldn't help but think about chicken wings. The craving was overwhelming and after lunch, I ordered some chicken wings for myself and disposed of the waste in the kitchen bin, completely forgetting that my mother-in-law would see it when she used the bin.\n\nLater that evening, she found the wrappers and confronted me about it. She was visibly upset and felt hurt, believing that I didn't like her food and that I preferred ordering out. I tried to explain that it was just a pregnancy craving and not a reflection of her cooking, but she was deeply hurt and disappointed.\n\nNow my MIL is being distant and is avoiding me and my husband is being neutral. He did express he was upset I ate chicken as we are vegetarians, but he is not picking a side and told me that he is styaing out of it. I am on maternity leave, so I am with MIL all day. My husband is on call most days, and when he is at home he is mostly asleep. I am not sure if I am TA, or what to do to fix the situation, and I genuinely have nothing against her cooking, I just had a craving and I didn't think this would still be awkward two days on, I thought it would just blow over.", "created_utc": 1686241242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144dnwx/aita_for_secretly_ordering_chicken_wings_after_my/", "score": 535, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Each month, I was fucked up when my menstruation came up. \n\n\nAfter a lot of self-battling I went to the doctor. He told me I needed at least twice a month to ingest a bit of red meat. That my body needed it. We are not made for wating everyday red meat, but we do need more energy. Maybe if you craved chicken, your body needs something else that your current diet is not giving you nor the baby.", "NTA - your body is telling you something. This is extremely common!  \nWhen I was pregnant with our first, I'd been vegetarian for seven years. I'd drive down the street and daydream about getting a fast food burger. I finally just started eating meat again after about four months. Our meals don't focus on meat, but we definitely eat and enjoy it.   \nSo feed that baby and eat what you want. You've explained it, and have nothing to apologize for.

Even if it WAS exactly the situation she thought it was, I think you executed your social obligations thoroughly--you ate her meal, you enjoyed it, you complimented her cooking. You were polite in every way. It's not an either/or thing; plenty of people appreciate a home-cooked meal and also like to order in the occasional junk food treat. She may never get over it, but I encourage \\*you\\* to get over it, and stop kicking yourself for doing something pretty normal. Keep talking with her, spend time with her, cook with her if she's open to it, ask for her advice on the baby even if you don't really need it--there are lots of ways to remind her that you value her and the relationship you have with her without needing a time machine. \n\nIf she's still icing you out after a few more days and it's making you uncomfortable, tell your husband you need his support to either have a conversation and resolve it with her, or to ask her to leave.

Keep your husband out of this. NTA", "I'm going with NTA. You didn't order the wings to diss her cooking, you ordered them because you were craving them.

Eating protein esp since it has some amino acids and vitamins that a fetus needs and can't easily be reproduced in a vegetarian diet, is probably the opposite of bad for the baby.    A pregnant person can need up to TWICE the amount of protein than a non-pregnant person, and while there are ways to get vegetarian protein, for sure, chicken wings sounds like a great source of easy to find protein.", "NTA, what a weird thing to assume", "NTA You coulda stopped at \"I'm currently pregnant and having cravings\".

The chicken wings were in addition to. You craved substantial protein. NTA.", "NTA. But also that craving might be a sign that being vegetarian while pregnant might not be a good idea for you.

It's hard to get all of the nutrients that you need during pregnancy if you are a strict vegetarian - a lot of vegetarians that I know actually started eating chicken and fish during their pregnanies because it was just the easiest way to ensure they had adequate amounts of vitamins and other nutrients that are needed to support a healthy pregnancy. \n\nIf you are craving meat or having other cravings it's your body telling you what it needs to make a healthy baby - don't let anyone police what you can and can't eat when you are pregnant!", "You can eat whatever you want.

Its hubby's job to tell her, tho.", "NTA\n\nYou ate everything she made, there really is no issue here.\nIf you didn't and you wasted her food, sure I'd be on her side but this is just being dramatic, probably because it was meat.\n\nTell her to build a bridge and get over it.", "NTA MIL is blowing this way out of proportion and husband doesn\u2019t get to decide whether or not you\u2019re vegetarian.", "NTA and she shouldn't be snooping through your trash - that's weird.", "NTA. I think about chicken wings throughout most vegetarian meals, and I'm not even pregnant. Chicken wings are top tier. \n\nIt's not like you stuffed one in MIL's mouth. You are your own person and get to decide what you put in your body-  she is acting irrationally.", "NTA\n\nYour kid wanted chicken wings, not you! She should be angry at them! \n\nJk\n\nStill. You ate her food and something else just for yourself. I see no problem there expect that your husband already picked a site.", "NTA. I was strict vegetarian for like 14 years.

Ridiculous for her to be offended..I would have laughed it off\u2026", "If they are vegatarian for ethical reasons, then they are hypocrites.

You didn\u2019t throw her food away and order other food.. you ate what she made and then ordered a craving food. You can coexist with your vegetarian family and not be one yourself. Don\u2019t let them bully you", "NTA. You don't have to be a vegetarian throughout your entire pregnancy just so your MIL can feel good about herself. That's not how the world works.\n\nThat being said, you are presumably an adult, and should be capable of being open and truthful to your husband and MIL. Just sit down, apologize for the misunderstanding that you allowed to persist, and then inform them going forward that you may, in fact, decide to continue eating meat when you want to. Not to insult them, but because in moderation it is good for both you and the pregnancy. Then it's up to her how she wants to handle that information, but at least she's not upset about the lying and hiding.", "NTA - You did zero wrong. You indulged a food craving and aren't ashamed of what you did. No reason to hide the evidence that you have and indulge food cravings.", "NTA. I hate how fucking weird people get over food. Nobody gets a vote on what other people put in their mouths. And I say that as someone who doesn\u2019t eat chicken.", "It's your home, your body, you wanted something, your decision. If you had ordered something meat-free I wonder if she would have been just as rude about it.", "NTA (and I honestly find it kind of odd that you're expected to be beholden to the same dietary restrictions as your husband and the rest of his family)\n\nI'm a man and even I understand how intense pregnancy cravings can be for women. Your MIL is just overreacting.", "NTA. I would be concerned about the MIL encouraging you to make your baby vegetarian when it gets older against your wishes. While a vegetarian diet for kids is normal, its not in the USA and takes effort with seeing nutritionalists, etc. And because of how archaic western thinking can be, parents with veg babies tend to get a lot of slack. \n\nUltimately your body, your choice. This is what bodily autonomy is for. You ate her food, and you ate some more food that you were craving. Pregnancy is hard. Do you.", "Lol don\u2019t feel bad. I was the same way when I was pregnant. Complete vegetarian before pregnancy but then while pregnant, all I wanted was chicken wings \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24.

You did nothing wrong and I hope your husband and MIL gets over it soon. NTA!", "NTA", "NTA, of course.  There's nothing you should do to fix this situation, other than tell your MIL to either grow up or go home.

Baby gets what baby wants!  When I was pregnant with my daughter, I craved chicken fingers ALL THE TIME!!!  Giving into cravings kept the morning sickness away!  You really can't help what your body wants when you're pregnant.  Also, you are your own person, you really don't have to be a vegetarian just because your husband is.", "NTA You\u2019re an adult and can eat whatever you want.\n\nY T A for making me crave chicken wings now \ud83d\ude01", "NTA!! I was almost completely vegetarian before I got pregnant (I just wasn't a big meat eater) but the baby wanted protein!  Tell MIL you were thinking of what's best for the BABY and YOUR BODY.  Does she cares more about what she considers to be her own personal morals than what's best for her future grandchild?  It's whack and I would have your HUSBAND explain it to her in a way that says it's not about her.  Did her MIL dictate the terms of her pregnancy as well?  I'm wondering how she would have felt if someone had told her what she could and couldn't consume.  Like jfc where is the logic?

They were more likely to have lower levels of vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D and iron in their diet.\n\nChildren on vegan diets had about 5% lower bone mineral content and were on average 3cm shorter in height. This is important, as the higher the bone mineral content, the higher the bone mineral density.\n\nThis 5% difference is concerning, as people have a limited period of time at this age in which they can optimise their bone mineral density; 95% of bone mass is attained by about 20 years of age. Lower bone densities are linked to higher rates of fractures in later life.\n\nVegetarians showed less pronounced nutritional deficiencies but, unexpectedly, a less favourable cardiovascular risk profile compared to both meat-eaters and vegans.

It's clear she felt that way, but there are no reasons listed.  \n\nThe only ones that make sense are she is violating their religion (or she actually hated her MILs food - which is the presumption).
