I\u2019m by no means famous and I don\u2019t even consider myself an influencer but I do have around 20k followers on insta from gaming and having a few viral videos.\n\nNow for the situation. I posted an incredibly innocent video of a welcome sign where I made a pun from the words on the sign. That was the whole video. I don\u2019t want to give more details because it also went somewhat viral and anymore details would give me away.\n\nAnyway for some reason this random girl got incredibly agressive with me in the comments about it not being an original video. Here is the exact conversation:\n\nGirl: [this] s the theme of my apartment. Yes.\nWe all know. This is a stupid post\n\nMe: let people have fun\n\nGirl: no, especially not you.\n\nGirl: you made a stupid joke everyone's made 7 million times already.\nCome up with something original.\n\nMe: I feel bad for you\n\nGirl: I feel bad that you can't make good original content and that you have this much time on your hands to respond to criticism.\n\nMe: it's Saturday \n\n-At this point I had looked at her profile (I usually so this to make sure I\u2019m not talking to a minor) and saw her college and that she was a psychology major-\n\nMe: I\u2019m confused, your in psychology but are harassing random strangers for just trying to make people smile on the internet? Are psychologists supposed to be non judgmental?\n\nAfter that comment she deleted her comment and messaged me this in DMs:\n\n\u201cYou're fucked up for stalking my profile\nGet a fucking life ya dumb \ud83d\udc36 \nJust because I have original content and ideas doesn't mean you need to be jealous and envious of me\nFucking weirdo\u201d\n\nNow I have never retaliated to hate before. I have gotten death threats, dick pics, etc and never done anything but for some reason seeing she was a psychology major really pissed me off.\n\nSo I screen shotted all her messages and comments and went on the school Facebook page and sent them to them.\n\nHere\u2019s where I think I might be the ah: My husband thought that me doing that was messed up because she could get kicked out of school, but I feel like she said the things, if they kick her out it\u2019s because of her actions not mine. I have a public page where anyone could see what she was saying. As a psych major and school athlete, she needs to not harass people.\n\nSo is what I did messed up? Or is it her own fault?\n\nAdding for some context why the psychology major triggered me so much. Not saying this makes me not TA, but just some understanding:\n\nMy sister had a therapist for years. One day I found out the therapist was harassing my mom and making her cry every time my sister would vent to her about normal family drama. She was incredibly unprofessional and I am still angry to this day that a therapist would be so harmful.\nI just see this girl has becoming that kind of person if she has no consequences to harassment.\n\nUPDATE:\nWhile so far 50% of people seem to agree with me, enough people think what I did was messed up. I messaged the same page I did before and said \u201cwe have resolved this privately. I hope that not action is taken on this person.\u201d Since you can\u2019t delete fb messages.\n\nThanks for the hard truth guys. I\u2019m going to make it right.", "created_utc": 1688917047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v1m1w/aita_for_sending_screenshots_to_her_school_when/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it highly unlikely. I think OP may have just shot herself in the foot.

It may even be worse if the person does actually get kicked out of school.\n\nWhat OP did was pathetic in my opinion. Yeah, the poster was a hostile. But there was no threat of violence or anything else that warranted reporting to the school. The worst stuff was sent via DM, which I think would be considered a private conversation.", "Maybe some background will help.

I think she also freaked out because she didn't anticipate that someone would dig into her profile and felt threatened.
