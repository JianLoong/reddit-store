Demote her to guest so she can be with her bf.", "NTA it sounds like the day will run smoother if she is just a guest - no make up schedule demands, seating demands etc. she can enjoy the day with her boyfriend and you can have a day to remember for all the right reasons.", "Info: why does she want to with with her boyfriend and not at the bridal table? I feel like there\u2019s something missing from this sorry. Will the boyfriend know anyone else there? Does she know the other bridesmaids? There has to be some other thing going on here.", "I feel we might get a rather different version of events from your sister. If she has mental health issues she may feel more relaxed during the reception if her bf is nearby. Can you add him to the bridal table? Or can she sit at an ordinary table and still be a bridesmaid? Feels harsh to demote her unless you really really have to, especially if the issues are caused by her mental health. Far kinder to be inclusive, especially given that she's your sister and will be part of your life forever. Otherwise, every time she sees the wedding photos she'll be reminded of the demotion, and it'll hurt.", "NTA. The wedding is about you not your sister so she shouldn\u2019t expect you to deal with all that!", "NTA, it's your wedding so you have final say, but I will say it's quite ironic that she can't be with her boyfriend on a day of connecting couples/holy matrimony haha", "NTA\n\nIt's not her boyfriend's special day, it's yours and she needs to realize it.", "NTA. She probably genuinely doesn't remember, but she doesn't even sound from your description like she's upset to not be a bridesmaid. If she doesn't go to your wedding over not being permitted to sit by her friend, I think she'll regret it in the future.", "NTA, your wedding, your rules.", "nta: it\u2019s your special day and she\u2019s asking you to move the arrangements just to sit next to her bf?? no- i\u2019m not married but i have heard enough/can imagine planning a wedding is stressful enough so for her to add this element just bc she wants to sit by her bf is not fair to you or your fianc\u00e9 .", "NTA.

It would be beat for all parties involved if you just demoted her from bridesmaid to guest.

She sounds like a spoiled entitled brat. I would cut her out of my wedding party too and let her come as a regular guess. If she can't understand why spell it out for her. If she doesn't like it she doesn't have to come. It's your and your fiance's day. Enjoy it.", "NTA. I was MOH for my best friend and sat at the top table with the bridal party while my husband and our toddler son sat at another table. That\u2019s how it goes when you\u2019re in the wedding party. \n\nSister doesn\u2019t want to fulfill the duties of bridesmaid = she doesn\u2019t have to be bridesmaid.", "Op, no dancing around this, make her a guest, she asked, no change to her schedule and you have peace. Win win-win. NTA", "Exactly, she wants to stay with her boyfriend so BADLY, op, accommodate her and never bring it up again", "It is NORMAL that she wants to spend event swith her boyfriend. It is the normal thing to do. ALL OTHER guests are with their partner too.", "But the guests decide if they come or not.", "OP is an Ah to even make this discusion necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt a wedding, you sit couple's together. Unless you are a mannerless and clueless AH.", "\"Allowing the sister an escape from the tedious duty\" would be the better wording.", "NTA. If she so desperately needs to it with her boyfriend then so be it she can sit with her boyfriend and not be part of the bridal party. If you can't cope being separated for a few hours then don't take on something that would mean being separated for a few hours.", "NTA. Her asking to move the wedding later so she can attend with her boyfriend is ridiculous. Many couples, where one is in the wedding party and the other isn\u2019t, attend separately due to prep time being earlier than start time. If it\u2019s an issue of transportation, offer to drive your sister, on-time, to wherever you guys are getting ready. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t just get up from her assigned seat and go hang out with her boyfriend. Are guests expected to remain seated during the entire reception? If this is a plated meal event, can she not pull up a chair, walk her plate to a table with her boyfriend and eat with him? I don\u2019t understand why anything has to change.\nINFO:  are you being adamant about people remaining in their seats?\nIf this is the case, E S H. Her for insisting the time of the wedding being changed and you for making people stay in their assigned areas during a party.", "I have given her what she wanted which was to be with her boyfriend. I think I was more heart broken as I really wanted to spend time with her before I got married and had her by my side on my special day, but I feel like she is prioritising him over me. \n\nI have also never asked her to do anything extra for the wedding and she had never asked me if I needed help either. I only wanted to share my special day with her.", "I agree with this. Thank you! My sis in law said the same. At least I can now spend the day with people with no uncertainty and messing up schedules and focus on the start of a new chapter with my husband to be.", "She wanted to be with her boyfriend because he hasn't met my family before. But he has met me and our group of friends and I have placed them with our group of friends that he has met numerous times. \n\nYes, she is friends with all the groomsmen and bridesmaid as we are in the same group of friends. That's why I feel like if she has told me weeks or months before how she felt, I could have made other arrangements like not having a bridal table. But it is difficult as the venue couldn't accomodate changes and more stressful on me so close to the wedding.", "It\u2019s the norm for the bridal party to sit separately at a formal reception. Have never attended a single wedding where bridesmaids sat with their partners unless both were in the wedding party.", "At most weddings you're only separated for the meal.  If you can't be separated from your partner for an hour, there's something that needs to bf addressed.  That's not normal.", "Yes but all the other guests that are sat with their partners aren\u2019t part of the bridal party ..", "It is the norm to have family sit with their partners."]}
