They could easily switch up who walks who, but for some reason they seem adamant on having them walk together. Everyone in the bridal party are all old friends and often talk about times that he and his ex were together fondly. To me it seems like a calculated decision.

He is a jerk by association. What you need to lobby for is sitting with him for dinner. Either up on the dias or he sits at your table. Do not let them put you at the randos table.

Knowing you would be sat there watching?\n\nOP you've got their number. They'd be stupid to not think this might upset you which means there was intention.

It's also such a simple thing to fix.", "YTA \n\nI am so blown away by the levels of insecurity and narcissism. Bridal parties are typically arranged by height of some other random factor. In all honesty the bride is not thinking about destroying your marriage, on her wedding day. Even if it was something she wanted, she is not going to do it at her wedding. It could cause a fight, or drama that would take away from her. It\u2019s for 5 mins! Not a big deal. \n\nAlso, if the roles were reversed? \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding in a few weeks, one of the groomsmen\u2019s wife is upset because the bridesmaid he is paired with, is also his ex.

Could it be because the rest of the party are already \"couples\" and these were the 2 that were left?  If that isn't the case, maybe your husband could ask his friend for a different partner.  I only think they may be the AH because you say they reminisce about the \"good old days\" when these two were together, and this makes me wonder if they are hoping for them to get back together.  \n\nYou, however, would be an AH to your husband and yourself if you don't go.  As other posters have said, if they are doing this vindictively, you would be playing into their hands.  If they are doing it with no ill intentions, then you look like a spoiled child who is ruining their day by causing your husband to be uncomfortable and possibly distracted on this day.  Go and be the wife that you are, who is his choice, and own it.  He is yours, he picked you, so it doesn't matter what anyone else wants.  Be kind, be amazing.

If it were family constantly saying how great is was when he and ex were a couple they wouldn\u2019t get a pass. Friends don\u2019t get one either.\n\nAt the same time this specific point isn\u2019t that momentous and will be over in seconds. It\u2019s not the hill to die on.\n\nGot it the wedding, enjoy yourself, and show them that they can\u2019t needle you.

It's cool that your husband and his ex can co-parent well and are on okay terms, sure, but them and their friends reminiscing about when they were a thing is disrespectful to you.

If his friends don't seem to listen to that, your husband has a decision to make. I'd want him standing up to it. If he really wants to walk down the aisle with his ex, I'd be a bit concerned.\n\nKeep communicating with him and hopefully it can get resolved.", "I think if you didn't go, you would be overthinking all night. I'd let them walk together but still attend", "I guess I don't really see the issue, but I don't know the friend group situation. It's not your husband's wedding to make this decision... He COULD ask if they can switch him, but that seems pretty to me. It's not like they're walking down the aisle together to get married, it's not like he has to spend the whole evening with her, he'll be with you once the ceremony and pictures are over... They're supporting mutual friends in their marriage. I walked down the aisle with my friend's friend....and didn't see him again for the rest of the night unless there were specific wedding party things going on. And even then, it's not like he was my pseudo-partner for the night. \n\nMy thought is kinda...if you are so insecure and untrusting that your husband can't walk down the aisle with his ex (that he assumedly has regular contact with due to the shared child)....why are you married to him? \n\nWithout having all of the ins and outs of everything and understanding the personalities involved, I'd have to go with YTA, unless other details are provided to show it's some sort of obnoxious set up, or they're being spiteful or something like that.", "YTA it\u2019s not your wedding you don\u2019t get to try to switch things up because you\u2019re insecure.", "I feel it\u2019s YTA, borderline ESH.

I wish ALL exes would act in a manner that would allow them this level of good standing for the sake of family and friends. Unfortunately most get the entire opposite. \n\nI almost get a hint of jealousy and insecurity from the OP. Do you have reason to believe your man would jump ship, just from some friendly and civil interaction with his ex? Does he give you reason to believe he would be such a person? \n\nYes it might be a simple, yet puzzling, fix to simply have them change up. But why? I feel there is ultimately an underlying factor here that\u2019s not being admitted to.", "YTA.

There is \"insecure, and then there is whatever the hell this is.", "This must be an unpopular option, but YTA.  It's a walk down the aisle.  It doesn't matter if the bride and groom are doing this as a master plan to try and get them back together, it's not your husband's choice to be paired up with her, it's theirs.  They already co-parent a child, what's the big deal with the walk?   You either trust your husband or you don't.  \n\nI definitely understand feeling a certain way about it, but refusing to go to the wedding because of it is overly dramatic and unnecessary.  If it were me, I would vent to my friends if it bothered me and then show up at the wedding all smiles and congratulations.  There is no way I'd let them know 'they won' in trying to upset me.", "YTA for making an empty threat. \n\nYou\u2019ll go because you won\u2019t be able to stand not being there to watch them and gather ammunition.", "YTA quit being jealous and insecure.

Even if the bride is set on having things go her way for whatever reason, he should make the effort to make you happy.

Don't ditch him at this wedding over this, it's silly.", "NTA. \n\nThis seems like a calculated choice, and I would look at my husband differently if he didn't understand my discomfort and try to advocate for me.", "This was not yr husband's choice but his friends. Is it weird? Prob, but don't pressure your husband about it. He will seem like an ah if he backs out of walking with the ex.

It means they have a bond for life, as co-parents. It is in everyone's best interest if that relationship is cordial, meaning they can walk down an aisle together. Don't make your husband choose between what you feel is a slight and his child's best interest. It will come up many times going forward, and the more you loosen up on managing that relationship, the stronger your own relationship will be. Weak YTA, because I get how you feel, but do the right thing in spite of that.", "YTA. Have you ever walked down the aisle as part of a bridal party?

Have you communicated your apprehension/disaproval to husband? Has this friend group crossed lines before?\n\nDo you have issues seeing husband and his ex together in public, even with their shared child? \n\nIf it's more about respect to your marriage, then you're totally in your right to make your displeasure known. But if it's more rooted in insecurities like fear of relationship being affected or concerns about the friend group, you need to discuss that with your partner\n\nAdditional INFO?: How were the pairings decided/arranged? That might have been a factor of why they are set to walk the aisle together. Like existing couples are already pairs, height order, closeness to bride/groom, etc? You said best friend- any chance that they're best man and maid of honor? Or is their child like a ring boy/flower girl? 'Cause that'd be hard to change up. If that's the case I would say not your wedding, just don't go or attend politely. \n\n(If a concern is that he's sitting with the wedding party and/or ex instead of you, that's a whole 'nother story!)\n\nBut either way, you are entitled to have your feelings and take any action you see fit to protect yourself (like not attending.)

I think you\u2019re making it a bigger deal than it needs to be. \n\nMy brother got married last year and I had to walk down the aisle with someone I dated briefly who\u2019s now married. His wife is nice but not close to my SIL so she wasn\u2019t in the bridal party. Everyone else in the party had their current spouse walking down the aisle with them except the best man and MOH. So that left me to walk with him. It was mostly just incredibly awkward (he\u2019s also more than a foot taller than me so it probably looked funny too lol). My brother and SIL didn\u2019t do it because they had some hidden agenda, that\u2019s just how it worked out. My brother thought it was funny because he\u2019s a butthead but no one had any nefarious intentions. We walked down the aisle for 30 seconds and rode into the reception together on scooters and that was it. We were briefly sitting at the head table for toasts and food (like 20-30 minutes) then we barely crossed paths the rest of the night. He was with his wife, I was with my niblets. Everyone had fun and there was no drama. \n\nNow sure her relationship with your ex was clearly more serious than mine was but it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge deal unless you make it one. You\u2019re going to look childish if you refuse to go and if someone *is* doing it to mess with you then they\u2019ll have won. As long as he isn\u2019t doing anything actually inappropriate, just go, suck it up and hang out with him once he\u2019s done with the groomsman stuff.

I would say that this reeks of a gaslighting scenario. They purposely created a situation that if you actively resisted would make you look petty and if did nothing could have a variety of negative consequences.\n\nMy opinion would be to attend the wedding and keep a big smile on. But also scout out or keep an eye out for other similar moments. Like what are the seating arrangements, is it a wedding party table without +1s? Are there moments that you are the only +1 being \"forgotten\" and if so, can you inject yourself without looking petty? Are both children invited to the wedding, and is your child being sidelined compared to others? Is the wedding party doing uncommon events that can have dual intentions and keeping you off to the side? \n\nI wouldn't suggest doing anything that makes you look petty. Stand tall. Play innocent.

Your husbands friends are rather ignorant to pair him up with his ex. I\u2019m wondering what the motivation for that is? I\u2019d make sure I look absolutely amazing at the wedding.

Like her husband and his ex are still good friends and she cant quite get over it, so she reads into every interaction and blows it out of proportion.\n\nThen again, it's also entirely possible that the friends DO like the ex more and think they should get back together.

It\u2019s an easy fix and friends insisting on this specific detail proves that there is more at play here than just a mere walk down the aisle - as in maybe trying to make OP uncomfortable and humiliate her. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re trying to bend OP\u2019s arm in a power play, but if someone tried that on me I would refuse to play their game, too. Why go there and submit to this kind of bullshit because someone is getting married? Not worth it imo.", "Why is the other side making such a big deal though if it\u2019s so inconsequential?", "True. I would want to know what all OP's husband is expected to commit to. A simple walk down the aisle? Sucks, but I'd suck it up. But photos need a boundary and pairing at the meal table seems excessive.", "I don't know, I tend to believe OP (and in general, the \"not in the former group\" new boyfriend/girlfriend)... Friends can be awfully rude in these things when there is such a bias involved. I have seen it on my friends group, I didn't want to get back with my ex but there definitely was a certain \"soft push\" and comparison with the new partners... Usually, the new partners are right when they notice these things but they try not to cause a scene because they are outnumbered anyway.", "I've been in several bridal parties and this was my experience. I just googled \"bridal party pictures\" and what a suprise! Pics of the bride and groom with the bridesmaids and groomsmen paired up!", "I've been to a wedding where the bridal party were paired even down to clothing.\n\nBlue dress with blue tie etc.\n\nThere were a lot of pairings in the photos, seating arrangements, and yes. They were asked to lead the rest of the attendees in joining the married couple on the floor after the first verse/chorus.\n\nI'll let you into a secret..... Some things do happen.", "Seriously, \u201cGrow up!\u201d was my first thought, too.\n(My second thought was \u201cThat\u2019s right, dummy, don\u2019t go. Leave them together all night to bond over how ridiculous you are being if you want them to be even closer.\u201d)", "OP is also a mother to his other kid.", "I should have put \"don't ever touch an ex again\" in my vows, what an oversight.  /s", "The vows to forsake all others, and let no others come  between what has been joined together.", "It could be the general idea of \"I will swear my loyalty fealty and all acts of chivalry shall only be towards you, my special partner who I hold in a special bond\" of wedding vows.\nIt's pretty bad optics to make that pledge and then turn around a few years later and walk back down the aisle with an ex at a wedding.\nTbh I just see it as a very public walk, but as soon as one of the parties involved has strong feelings and feels like it's more meaningful, then an adult discussion should happen that leaves all partnerships feeling respected.", "Maybe the group alienates Op because she does things like insert herself into other peoples weddings, and throws a tantrum of sorts when it doesn\u2019t go the way *she* wants? (Ie: make them change their arrangements or *im not going*).", "The irony of it being hard to know what KWIM means. I was like \u201cwho the hell is Kwim?\u201d", "Know what I mean lol", "I think know what I mean?", "Know What I Mean", "Know what I mean? It's pretty common netspeak", "Sometimes it's the person dealing with the feelings job to get over it and not for everyone else to accommodate them. this is one of those cases.", "I think u/harveysnake is pointing out at 3. that her not attending is contrary to her own interests/concerns. \n\nOP\u2019s issue regarding the pairing of husband and ex seems to be that she thinks it is a ploy to get them back together by the bride and groom. But if she doesn\u2019t go, that would seem to playing into their hands, since it is more likely that husband and ex will spend even more time together (maybe being paired to dance together at the reception for example) it at the very least means husband will spend more time with ex than OP that day (even if it is just the short walk down the aisle) which is surely making the bride/grooms job easier.\n\nAs for a judgement I think there is a lot of missing INFO here:\n\n1. What is your husbands view here, has he asked for it to be changed? What did the bride/groom say?\n2. How many are in the wedding party?\n3. Is there a reason they have been paired together beyond their previous relationship (I.e Best Man and MoH, the other matches are couples etc.?)", "Having been witness to a gossipy wedding, it can matter.\n\nMy friend had to walk with someone who had asked her out previously and then dealt with the \"You two looked cosy\"/\"You make a handsome couple\"/\"Won't you give the poor boy a chance\" comments for the a while after on the day. \n\nCredit where its due, bride apologised for making things uncomfortable.", "Thank you for voicing some sense in here!", "I can understand it if they were no children involved. Then it depends on who ended the relationship and why. Like, if my bf started rekindling a friendship with an ex who dumped him for something stupid, I'd be minorly freaking out.", "Because who in their right mind would think that it'd be hurtful? They are adults that have moved on with their life.", "This is a comment stealing bot. Original comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xx3yv/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_if_he_walks_his/j7uq0i1/", "Or it's not about OP at all?", "Lol what confidence what trust? She's mad he's walking down a wedding next to her lol", "Her feelings aren't being considered in somebody else's wedding that she is not even involved in?", "Allowed", "True, but giving OP a bit of the benefit of the doubt, pairing that with them supposedly being *adamant * about something that really doesn't matter in the wedding and I fall more on OP's side and the likelihood of it being the latter of your scenarios.", "Feels like having this instinctive issue with it is just a lack of trust in your partner.  If you have no issue with them walking down the aisle with a random woman, why should it matter that he's doing it with his ex?", "Should he also guve up custody? He might be forced to spend time with her since they have a kid", "It\u2019s not the wedding of the child OP\u2019s husband has with his ex-wife. It\u2019s his friend\u2019s wedding.", "I\u2019d be more annoyed if they were seated together at the head table. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think this is a huge deal. This friend group has a history and OP seems kind of hostile about not having been there and that her partner had a life before her.", "It doesn't need to be a sore subject though. Why not just have a civil relationship with your stepchild's mom? Unless there's some legit reason to think there's something more going on we dont know - but even then it'd be on the husband and not the ex. It doesn't need to be complicated is all.", "Its simple, because the bride is long time friends with the ex. The bride shouldn't put OP in the wedding just because her husband is.", "I agree, but I think that OP threatening not to go is only helping their agenda. \u201cThe controlling, jealous wife throws a tantrum and doesn\u2019t attend the wedding, leaving the two long lost lovers in a romantic setting, reminding each other of the love they once had. They then sit next to each other at the meal and reminisce of the wonderful times they had together, while the wife sits at home alone throwing darts at pictures of the beautiful ex\u2019s face.\u201d \nOP, you need to go to that wedding. Follow the advice of the others and smile gracefully during the ceremony, and then happily stand by his side the rest of the time!", "I've seen it happen both ways. Sometimes there's the \"soft push\", and sometimes it's just straight-up insecurity. Like I said, no way of knowing with the information we've got.", "well yeah and his wife, which mean sometimes. Their kids are siblings and everyone should get along pretty well you'd think. Does she think the ex-wife wants him back or something?  Just seems like a non-issue to me.", "I mean, this is like briefly seeing your ex at a child's soccer game or giving them a quick hug when they're going through a hard time.\n\nPlenty of amicable breakups where people are still in each other's lives and might have to attend events and even stand near each other for brief periods of time.", "Yep, that phrasing wasn't in my vows at all.\n\nPerhaps they weren't in OP's, either.", "I definitely didn't have any of that phrase in my vows. Goodness.", "Not sure why I'm getting downvoted for that but IDGAF.\n\nThat means I don't give a fuck, in case anyone was wondering.", "yeah... that's why instead of demanding respect from the bride and her bridal party she is choosing not to attend. lol", "Bingo!\n\nThis could be completely innocent or it could be a setup by a meddling groom/bride who want these two people to get back together.  With the OP not there, who is her husband going to spend the whole night talking to?  His ex.  Romantic setting.  Alcohol.  Plenty of time together discussing the good ol' days.  Friends egging them on... *I'm sure nothing inappropriate will come of it.*\n\nOr the wife can go and be the focus of her husband's attention and guarantee that nothing inappropriate is possible.", "So then it won\u2019t be a problem to change it then will it? Doesn\u2019t sound like the friendship group has moved on to me.\nI can understand why it\u2019d make OP uncomfortable.", "I view it as disrespectful to the current relationship he's in. I wouldn't want to see my husband walking arm in arm with his ex or stand by and watch as they take a 100 pictures together. It's just icky to me.", "\"If you don't mind a random woman, why mind the woman who he has jizzed inside? Whats the difference?\"", "Not a lack of trust. It's a lack of respect towards OP by the bride and groom.", "Seriously? Did you really just compared a random person and his ex? I don't need to explain how ridiculous you sound but what I can tell you is if the husband allows his friends to just pair him into his ex then it is a fair reason to not trust him at all.", "Its not about the partner necessarily, though I think the husband here is fucking up and making things worse, its about how the friends seem to lack respect for OP's marriage compared to the past relationship with the ex.\n\nIts clear with OP's description that they are \"adamant\" about  this arrangement and that she feels like his friend group is always reminiscing fondly about the times when her husband and his ex are together, she feels like the friends don't like her and might even be a threat to her marriage. They for sure wouldn't protect it in any way at least and probably prefer it to end.\n\nHow true that is, we can't know. But at least by OP's telling of this story, it seems likely to me and she has made no mention of any effort by her husband to reassure her. We would just be speculating on nothing if we go the other way I think.", "The ex and the husband were couple friends with the people- not separate friends. They reminisce about couple friend things together. When they broke up, that dynamic should have opened up room for OP and other new people, even if sides were not taken. Idk how many ways there are to do a wedding party, but forcing two ex's down the aisle hand in hand ain't the solution. Unless the ex/husband are cool. and why should he be when his wife feels this way? Something smells very wrong.", "My fake phrase isn't one I've ever heard in wedding vows either, just the general sense of what vows do. They set your union apart from other social bonds in your life.", "As if that's not disrespectful", "The groom is obviously close friends with the husband. The bride is obviously close friends with the ex. We don't know anything about who else is in the wedding party. This is what made the most sense to them based on their entire wedding party. Its not like it is meant to be a hook-up!", "But that's the thing, there's no logic behind it apart from \"it doesn't seem right\"  Human beings are supposed to be able to manage their emotions and not react purely off of instinct.  Logic says, if you trust your partner, it shouldn't matter that they walk side by side with an ex.  It's like people who tell their partners they aren't allowed to hang out with an ex, even if they were friends before they were together.  Unless you have reason to believe they would be unfaithful, it's just not a fair way to treat someone.", "Exactly!!", "That's not an answer.  Again, if this idea bothers you, it just sounds like you don't trust your partner.  What's the concern?  That if he walks down the aisle with her he'll fall in love with her again?  If the only answer you have for why something is wrong is \"because I feel like it is\", then you don't have ground to stand on.", "They have a kid together.  It's safe to assume they are still in contact and fairly civil.  If they can spend time together with their kid, why can't they walk side by side?", "That's definitely something, all right.", "I don't think anyone is suggesting that it is. I don't think it's unfair for her to feel uncomfortable with it and if it's such a big deal for them to change it.. then there's clearly something untoward afoot. Otherwise why would they?", "Wedding are all about symbols. Someone thought it fitting that the husband and ex walk together. It isn\u2019t by chance, there is a point to it. Op doesn\u2019t like the point and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy to feel disrespected.", "Having boundaries doesn't require distrust. It can prevent a lot of unwanted situations that may be both intended and unintended.", "I did answer you. You don't have to agree with how I feel but you have no right to invalidate how I feel. Share your opinion with someone else at this point.", "The issue is not them being together, the issue is how adamant his friends in pairing them up together. It is obviously a powerplay made by his friends because no decent person will make their friends pair them up with their ex during wedding.  It is disrespectful and immature", "Why WOULDNT they have him walk with, I dunno, his current partner?", "Yeah, I mean, what if they accidentally fuck in the aisle in front of everyone?", "It isn't invalidating how you feel.  Feelings happen, but we're human beings.  We're supposed to be above just acting instinctively off our feelings.  To paraphrase Ted Lasso, you can't control your feelings, so by all means let your feelings control you.  If you can't think of a logical reason why you feel that way, maybe you should reflect."]}
