They could easily switch up who walks who, but for some reason they seem adamant on having them walk together. Everyone in the bridal party are all old friends and often talk about times that he and his ex were together fondly. To me it seems like a calculated decision.

He is a jerk by association. What you need to lobby for is sitting with him for dinner. Either up on the dias or he sits at your table. Do not let them put you at the randos table.

I could see it coming across as \u201cinconsiderate\u201d if there are known issues but it isn\u2019t inherently inconsiderate if there isn\u2019t a conflict. Presumably your husband and his ex are co-parents and possibly friends. \n\n\n\n\nBasically it could be an intentional burn or this could be your insecurities, there\u2019s some nuance to a situation like this.

Knowing you would be sat there watching?\n\nOP you've got their number. They'd be stupid to not think this might upset you which means there was intention.

Takes me back to our special day. Ah wonderful memories!' 'I hope you two are constantly surrounded by people who support your union and root for you every step of the way...because you CHOSE each other!' \n\nThen you take your hubbys arm, tell him he looks gorgeous (and you'll be appreciating all that latrr tonight) then go on and enjoy the rest of the day - on their dime.", "NTA.

It's also such a simple thing to fix.", "YTA \n\nI am so blown away by the levels of insecurity and narcissism. Bridal parties are typically arranged by height of some other random factor. In all honesty the bride is not thinking about destroying your marriage, on her wedding day. Even if it was something she wanted, she is not going to do it at her wedding. It could cause a fight, or drama that would take away from her. It\u2019s for 5 mins! Not a big deal. \n\nAlso, if the roles were reversed? \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding in a few weeks, one of the groomsmen\u2019s wife is upset because the bridesmaid he is paired with, is also his ex.

Could it be because the rest of the party are already \"couples\" and these were the 2 that were left?  If that isn't the case, maybe your husband could ask his friend for a different partner.  I only think they may be the AH because you say they reminisce about the \"good old days\" when these two were together, and this makes me wonder if they are hoping for them to get back together.  \n\nYou, however, would be an AH to your husband and yourself if you don't go.  As other posters have said, if they are doing this vindictively, you would be playing into their hands.  If they are doing it with no ill intentions, then you look like a spoiled child who is ruining their day by causing your husband to be uncomfortable and possibly distracted on this day.  Go and be the wife that you are, who is his choice, and own it.  He is yours, he picked you, so it doesn't matter what anyone else wants.  Be kind, be amazing.

If it were family constantly saying how great is was when he and ex were a couple they wouldn\u2019t get a pass. Friends don\u2019t get one either.\n\nAt the same time this specific point isn\u2019t that momentous and will be over in seconds. It\u2019s not the hill to die on.\n\nGot it the wedding, enjoy yourself, and show them that they can\u2019t needle you.

It's cool that your husband and his ex can co-parent well and are on okay terms, sure, but them and their friends reminiscing about when they were a thing is disrespectful to you.

Staying home would be the wrong move here.", "NTA , I think it's an odd pairing and I can understand how this would make you uncomfortable.

If his friends don't seem to listen to that, your husband has a decision to make. I'd want him standing up to it. If he really wants to walk down the aisle with his ex, I'd be a bit concerned.\n\nKeep communicating with him and hopefully it can get resolved.", "I think if you didn't go, you would be overthinking all night. I'd let them walk together but still attend", "I guess I don't really see the issue, but I don't know the friend group situation. It's not your husband's wedding to make this decision... He COULD ask if they can switch him, but that seems pretty to me. It's not like they're walking down the aisle together to get married, it's not like he has to spend the whole evening with her, he'll be with you once the ceremony and pictures are over... They're supporting mutual friends in their marriage. I walked down the aisle with my friend's friend....and didn't see him again for the rest of the night unless there were specific wedding party things going on. And even then, it's not like he was my pseudo-partner for the night. \n\nMy thought is kinda...if you are so insecure and untrusting that your husband can't walk down the aisle with his ex (that he assumedly has regular contact with due to the shared child)....why are you married to him? \n\nWithout having all of the ins and outs of everything and understanding the personalities involved, I'd have to go with YTA, unless other details are provided to show it's some sort of obnoxious set up, or they're being spiteful or something like that.", "YTA it\u2019s not your wedding you don\u2019t get to try to switch things up because you\u2019re insecure.", "I feel it\u2019s YTA, borderline ESH.

I wish ALL exes would act in a manner that would allow them this level of good standing for the sake of family and friends. Unfortunately most get the entire opposite. \n\nI almost get a hint of jealousy and insecurity from the OP. Do you have reason to believe your man would jump ship, just from some friendly and civil interaction with his ex? Does he give you reason to believe he would be such a person? \n\nYes it might be a simple, yet puzzling, fix to simply have them change up. But why? I feel there is ultimately an underlying factor here that\u2019s not being admitted to.", "YTA.

There is \"insecure, and then there is whatever the hell this is.", "This must be an unpopular option, but YTA.  It's a walk down the aisle.  It doesn't matter if the bride and groom are doing this as a master plan to try and get them back together, it's not your husband's choice to be paired up with her, it's theirs.  They already co-parent a child, what's the big deal with the walk?   You either trust your husband or you don't.  \n\nI definitely understand feeling a certain way about it, but refusing to go to the wedding because of it is overly dramatic and unnecessary.  If it were me, I would vent to my friends if it bothered me and then show up at the wedding all smiles and congratulations.  There is no way I'd let them know 'they won' in trying to upset me.", "YTA for making an empty threat. \n\nYou\u2019ll go because you won\u2019t be able to stand not being there to watch them and gather ammunition.", "YTA quit being jealous and insecure.

I bet they lined everyone up by height for photos & he ended up inadvertently paired with his ex. But he's your husband, he should try to fix it. Even if the bride is set on having things go her way for whatever reason, he should make the effort to make you happy.

Don't ditch him at this wedding over this, it's silly.", "NTA. \n\nThis seems like a calculated choice, and I would look at my husband differently if he didn't understand my discomfort and try to advocate for me.", "This was not yr husband's choice but his friends. Is it weird? Prob, but don't pressure your husband about it. He will seem like an ah if he backs out of walking with the ex.

It means they have a bond for life, as co-parents. It is in everyone's best interest if that relationship is cordial, meaning they can walk down an aisle together. Don't make your husband choose between what you feel is a slight and his child's best interest. It will come up many times going forward, and the more you loosen up on managing that relationship, the stronger your own relationship will be. Weak YTA, because I get how you feel, but do the right thing in spite of that.", "YTA. Have you ever walked down the aisle as part of a bridal party?

Have you communicated your apprehension/disaproval to husband? Has this friend group crossed lines before?\n\nDo you have issues seeing husband and his ex together in public, even with their shared child? \n\nIf it's more about respect to your marriage, then you're totally in your right to make your displeasure known. But if it's more rooted in insecurities like fear of relationship being affected or concerns about the friend group, you need to discuss that with your partner\n\nAdditional INFO?: How were the pairings decided/arranged? That might have been a factor of why they are set to walk the aisle together. Like existing couples are already pairs, height order, closeness to bride/groom, etc? You said best friend- any chance that they're best man and maid of honor? Or is their child like a ring boy/flower girl? 'Cause that'd be hard to change up. If that's the case I would say not your wedding, just don't go or attend politely. \n\n(If a concern is that he's sitting with the wedding party and/or ex instead of you, that's a whole 'nother story!)\n\nBut either way, you are entitled to have your feelings and take any action you see fit to protect yourself (like not attending.)

I think you\u2019re making it a bigger deal than it needs to be. \n\nMy brother got married last year and I had to walk down the aisle with someone I dated briefly who\u2019s now married. His wife is nice but not close to my SIL so she wasn\u2019t in the bridal party. Everyone else in the party had their current spouse walking down the aisle with them except the best man and MOH. So that left me to walk with him. It was mostly just incredibly awkward (he\u2019s also more than a foot taller than me so it probably looked funny too lol). My brother and SIL didn\u2019t do it because they had some hidden agenda, that\u2019s just how it worked out. My brother thought it was funny because he\u2019s a butthead but no one had any nefarious intentions. We walked down the aisle for 30 seconds and rode into the reception together on scooters and that was it. We were briefly sitting at the head table for toasts and food (like 20-30 minutes) then we barely crossed paths the rest of the night. He was with his wife, I was with my niblets. Everyone had fun and there was no drama. \n\nNow sure her relationship with your ex was clearly more serious than mine was but it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge deal unless you make it one. You\u2019re going to look childish if you refuse to go and if someone *is* doing it to mess with you then they\u2019ll have won. As long as he isn\u2019t doing anything actually inappropriate, just go, suck it up and hang out with him once he\u2019s done with the groomsman stuff.

I would say that this reeks of a gaslighting scenario. They purposely created a situation that if you actively resisted would make you look petty and if did nothing could have a variety of negative consequences.\n\nMy opinion would be to attend the wedding and keep a big smile on. But also scout out or keep an eye out for other similar moments. Like what are the seating arrangements, is it a wedding party table without +1s? Are there moments that you are the only +1 being \"forgotten\" and if so, can you inject yourself without looking petty? Are both children invited to the wedding, and is your child being sidelined compared to others? Is the wedding party doing uncommon events that can have dual intentions and keeping you off to the side? \n\nI wouldn't suggest doing anything that makes you look petty. Stand tall. Play innocent. If you call something out, do it in an innocent and neutral way with outside parties present. Don't stoop to the level they want you to.", "NTA. It\u2019s not just walking down the aisle.

It would be an easy change.   Unless they are doing it on purpose there's no reason not to change it", "NTA but also not the hill to die on. And for those saying \u201cit\u2019s just 30 second walk down the isle\u201d, in my experience it\u2019s more than that.

Your husbands friends are rather ignorant to pair him up with his ex. I\u2019m wondering what the motivation for that is? I\u2019d make sure I look absolutely amazing at the wedding.

People respecting boundaries is maturity and I do not know why OP is should be the one to be mature. \n\nBut I do agree that she should still go to the wedding and make them feel her presence. Sooner the guests will feel something is wrong why they paired a married man to his ex if they continues", "It's not \"weird\" they would insist on this. It's their vision for the wedding. It's an active choice. They see OP's husband and OP's ex as influential friends, but not OP apparently even though OP now has a kid with her husband.

Like her husband and his ex are still good friends and she cant quite get over it, so she reads into every interaction and blows it out of proportion.\n\nThen again, it's also entirely possible that the friends DO like the ex more and think they should get back together.

The vagueness of the statements makes me think she knows if she were specific it would look bad.  Are the times he and the ex were together specifically about them being a couple or just things that happened in that time period?  How many people are actually in the wedding party?  She says they could easily be switched but I'd kind of expect that to be followed at least with how many other options there are for him to be paired with to assuage her jealousy.", "Agreed. I sense OP has childish feeling everyone else is old good friends and she is not and unwelcome. Just because Op is new wife doesn\u2019t mean other friends have to exclude ex instead. Often those feelings go mutual to me, if OP is great company to group, she\u2019ll be more welcome, but I don\u2019t think this wedding is isolated incident, OP probably doesn\u2019t like ex and instead of appreciating husband and ex have amicable relationship now and their friends don\u2019t need to choose side or lose one of them.

Shouldn't people celebrate the institution of marriage? They are after all married and it's weird as hell that he is walking down the aisle with the ex. They can't be all good friends if she feels slighted. There is obviously more to this story.  They have to know that what they are doing is disrespectful to the new wife and that it makes her feel excluded. This isn't the mutual child's wedding that both coparents attend.  Is this a calculated risk that both the Bride and Groom want to make at their own wedding because they would like to see their friend get back with the ex or is it more so that they want a picture perfect wedding? It's not just a walk down the aisle, presumably they will take photos and maybe both the ex and husband will have to sit at a table with the wedding party during the reception leaving the new wife feeling like a awkward third wheel during the entire wedding.\n\nThis is an issue that both OP and the Husband need to address.
