In all honesty the bride is not thinking about destroying your marriage, on her wedding day. Even if it was something she wanted, she is not going to do it at her wedding. It could cause a fight, or drama that would take away from her. It\u2019s for 5 mins!

I only think they may be the AH because you say they reminisce about the \"good old days\" when these two were together, and this makes me wonder if they are hoping for them to get back together.  \n\nYou, however, would be an AH to your husband and yourself if you don't go.  As other posters have said, if they are doing this vindictively, you would be playing into their hands.  If they are doing it with no ill intentions, then you look like a spoiled child who is ruining their day by causing your husband to be uncomfortable and possibly distracted on this day.  Go and be the wife that you are, who is his choice, and own it.  He is yours, he picked you, so it doesn't matter what anyone else wants.  Be kind, be amazing.

They're supporting mutual friends in their marriage. I walked down the aisle with my friend's friend....and didn't see him again for the rest of the night unless there were specific wedding party things going on.

I wish ALL exes would act in a manner that would allow them this level of good standing for the sake of family and friends. Unfortunately most get the entire opposite. \n\nI almost get a hint of jealousy and insecurity from the OP. Do you have reason to believe your man would jump ship, just from some friendly and civil interaction with his ex? Does he give you reason to believe he would be such a person? \n\nYes it might be a simple, yet puzzling, fix to simply have them change up. But why?

They already co-parent a child, what's the big deal with the walk?   You either trust your husband or you don't.  \n\nI definitely understand feeling a certain way about it, but refusing to go to the wedding because of it is overly dramatic and unnecessary.

It means they have a bond for life, as co-parents. It is in everyone's best interest if that relationship is cordial, meaning they can walk down an aisle together. Don't make your husband choose between what you feel is a slight and his child's best interest. It will come up many times going forward, and the more you loosen up on managing that relationship, the stronger your own relationship will be.

Has this friend group crossed lines before?\n\nDo you have issues seeing husband and his ex together in public, even with their shared child? \n\nIf it's more about respect to your marriage, then you're totally in your right to make your displeasure known. But if it's more rooted in insecurities like fear of relationship being affected or concerns about the friend group, you need to discuss that with your partner\n\nAdditional INFO?: How were the pairings decided/arranged? That might have been a factor of why they are set to walk the aisle together. Like existing couples are already pairs, height order, closeness to bride/groom, etc? You said best friend- any chance that they're best man and maid of honor? Or is their child like a ring boy/flower girl? 'Cause that'd be hard to change up.

His wife is nice but not close to my SIL so she wasn\u2019t in the bridal party. Everyone else in the party had their current spouse walking down the aisle with them except the best man and MOH. So that left me to walk with him. It was mostly just incredibly awkward (he\u2019s also more than a foot taller than me so it probably looked funny too lol). My brother and SIL didn\u2019t do it because they had some hidden agenda, that\u2019s just how it worked out. My brother thought it was funny because he\u2019s a butthead but no one had any nefarious intentions. We walked down the aisle for 30 seconds and rode into the reception together on scooters and that was it. We were briefly sitting at the head table for toasts and food (like 20-30 minutes) then we barely crossed paths the rest of the night. He was with his wife, I was with my niblets. Everyone had fun and there was no drama. \n\nNow sure her relationship with your ex was clearly more serious than mine was but it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge deal unless you make it one. You\u2019re going to look childish if you refuse to go and if someone *is* doing it to mess with you then they\u2019ll have won. As long as he isn\u2019t doing anything actually inappropriate, just go, suck it up and hang out with him once he\u2019s done with the groomsman stuff.

They purposely created a situation that if you actively resisted would make you look petty and if did nothing could have a variety of negative consequences.\n\nMy opinion would be to attend the wedding and keep a big smile on. But also scout out or keep an eye out for other similar moments. Like what are the seating arrangements, is it a wedding party table without +1s? Are there moments that you are the only +1 being \"forgotten\" and if so, can you inject yourself without looking petty? Are both children invited to the wedding, and is your child being sidelined compared to others? Is the wedding party doing uncommon events that can have dual intentions and keeping you off to the side? \n\nI wouldn't suggest doing anything that makes you look petty. Stand tall. Play innocent. If you call something out, do it in an innocent and neutral way with outside parties present. Don't stoop to the level they want you to.", "NTA. It\u2019s not just walking down the aisle.

Your husbands friends are rather ignorant to pair him up with his ex. I\u2019m wondering what the motivation for that is? I\u2019d make sure I look absolutely amazing at the wedding.

People respecting boundaries is maturity and I do not know why OP is should be the one to be mature. \n\nBut I do agree that she should still go to the wedding and make them feel her presence. Sooner the guests will feel something is wrong why they paired a married man to his ex if they continues", "It's not \"weird\" they would insist on this. It's their vision for the wedding. It's an active choice. They see OP's husband and OP's ex as influential friends, but not OP apparently even though OP now has a kid with her husband.

Like her husband and his ex are still good friends and she cant quite get over it, so she reads into every interaction and blows it out of proportion.\n\nThen again, it's also entirely possible that the friends DO like the ex more and think they should get back together. With the very little amount of information we have, filtered through OP's perspective, it's impossible to know for sure one way or the other.", "Definitely speaks volumes.

I would want to know what all OP's husband is expected to commit to. A simple walk down the aisle? Sucks, but I'd suck it up.

Friends can be awfully rude in these things when there is such a bias involved. I have seen it on my friends group, I didn't want to get back with my ex but there definitely was a certain \"soft push\" and comparison with the new partners... Usually, the new partners are right when they notice these things but they try not to cause a scene because they are outnumbered anyway.", "I've been in several bridal parties and this was my experience.

But if she doesn\u2019t go, that would seem to playing into their hands, since it is more likely that husband and ex will spend even more time together (maybe being paired to dance together at the reception for example) it at the very least means husband will spend more time with ex than OP that day (even if it is just the short walk down the aisle) which is surely making the bride/grooms job easier.\n\nAs for a judgement I think there is a lot of missing INFO here:\n\n1. What is your husbands view here, has he asked for it to be changed? What did the bride/groom say?\n2. How many are in the wedding party?\n3.

Their kids are siblings and everyone should get along pretty well you'd think. Does she think the ex-wife wants him back or something?  Just seems like a non-issue to me.", "I mean, this is like briefly seeing your ex at a child's soccer game or giving them a quick hug when they're going through a hard time.\n\nPlenty of amicable breakups where people are still in each other's lives and might have to attend events and even stand near each other for brief periods of time.", "Yep, that phrasing wasn't in my vows at all.\n\nPerhaps they weren't in OP's, either.", "I definitely didn't have any of that phrase in my vows.

It's a lack of respect towards OP by the bride and groom.", "Seriously? Did you really just compared a random person and his ex?

They for sure wouldn't protect it in any way at least and probably prefer it to end.\n\nHow true that is, we can't know.

It's like people who tell their partners they aren't allowed to hang out with an ex, even if they were friends before they were together.  Unless you have reason to believe they would be unfaithful, it's just not a fair way to treat someone.", "Exactly!!", "That's not an answer.  Again, if this idea bothers you, it just sounds like you don't trust your partner.  What's the concern?  That if he walks down the aisle with her he'll fall in love with her again?

You're overreacting and being overly possessive of your husband.

Attending the wedding and celebrating their friend's happiness should be the priority, not trying to control who walks down the aisle with whom.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, you're an A by making this into a bigger issue than it needs to be and threatening not to attend the wedding over something as trivial as who walks down the aisle with whom. You need to get over yourself and focus on what's important.", "YTA. Weddings are about the bride and groom not about the partner of a member of the bridal party.

Now, if your *real* problem is that his friends are always bringing up his past relationship when you guys are together, this is the issue that you (well actually your husband) needs to address with his friends. Focusing on who he walks down the aisle will make you look petty.", "YTA This seems like a pretty odd hill to die on. The best response is no reaction whatsoever to the order of the bridal party marching in. Then, work on you inner self to discover why your insecurities are getting the better of you.

Walking with someone down the aisle will take 2 minutes and you threaten to end your marriage for that?  Hell, I'll even throw in a hour for group photos (with an entire group of people) and entering the reception so you're willing to toss your partner for less than 2 hrs. being with someone else around dozens of others.  They share a child.  Do you monitor how much time they talk about their child.  Do you have a timer set?

You are seriously threatening to not go to the wedding over this?

I would let it go, as it's really not that big of deal, it's weird and a little awkward, but really not worth being upset over. The fact they are in the same friend group and share a kid likely means they are on good terms and the bride and groom hopefully don't have any intention other than with the line up of the bridal party they happen to be walking in together. It's one event, just let him be in the wedding party and do the wedding party things. Refusing to go or raising a stink about something like that makes you look really insecure. I hate it for you if you are, but he is married to you, so that should count for something. I am not sure how cordial you are with his ex, but I would keep in mind she is also the mother of his child and a certain level of respect among all the adults involved is necessary for the kids. It's not worth causing a rift over or making him feel like he did something wrong just because he walked in a wedding with his ex.

If he ends up going I would pack all his shit and leave it outside.. she can have him!! \nI have a feeling your husband and her are having an affair unfortunately.", "INFO: Are all the other walking pairs couples? If so, I get how it could make sense to pair the leftovers together.  However, if the other pairs are not current couples then I hope your husband would be willing to ask them why the pairing and if they are willing to change it.  (Maybe it is a reason that makes sense?) \n\nRegardless, you are justified in feeling uncomfortable.  But please don\u2019t skip the wedding.  If the pairing stays, go and once it\u2019s done, let it be done.", "NTA. That sounds super intentional. Do they not like you?", "NTA. However these people are definitely putting their thumbs in your eye. Contrary to what you\u2019re being told here, I would not just be a doormat about this.

Your husband and his ex probably have more interaction together due to sharing custody of their child.

This isn't about the wedding. It's not even really about the ex. It is about respect for boundaries. I don't think him walking down the aisle with an ex would be a big deal. Him ignoring your feelings? Big deal.", "Right? It is so weird of the friends to force awkwardness at their wedding. Also strange husband and ex seem to be unbothered. My husband and his ex and me for that matter get along well for the sake of their child. I have zero jealousy toward them and know nothing would happen on his part even if they were the last two people on earth. But it would baffle me to find myself in this situation. My husband and his ex would rather NOT walk together. I\u2019m surprised these two don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird.  Our friends would never pair them in the first place (unless every other pair were a couple maybe? And even then I\u2019d think they would ask if it made anyone uncomfortable, which I guess we would all be fine with).

If they are so insensitive, it seems like they don\u2019t respect her at all. She\u2019s the interloper. And Husband is definitely also an asshole here. It does not bode well for the future of their relationship if he has a whole friend group that finds more value in his ex than they do her. Nothing about this sounds good. \n\nOP I hope you do what you feel is best for you- and have a serious talk with your husband about this friend group and how insensitive this is. If he isn\u2019t on your team and empathetic and willing to address this with his friends (not necessarily before the wedding- we\u2019re cutting it close and they may just take it as you making drama) and they aren\u2019t willing to be better to you- you deserve better from a husband and father of your child.

They walk down the aisle, then they're separated. Down and back is probably less than 5 minutes.

Then he has no other obligation to the woman he walks down the aisle. \n\nYou want him with you during the dinner", "Nah their focus of that moment is you and look everyone this is our daughter and we're very proud of her and they are grown up enough to put their differences whatever they may be aside to celebrate you on your day.\n\nIf you dad was escorting your mom that might be weird and probably would be questioned. But even then some divorced people and their new spouses all remain good friends and in those groups it wouldn't be weird either, but it's all about dynamic and their new relationships.", "I think this pairing at the wedding is the drop that is causing the bucket to overflow. It's a relatively small thing, but for OP it's the latest example of a pattern that hurts her. So she's blowing up about the pattern, which is an overreaction when judged against this particular situation.\n\nOP, I advice you to let this instance go. Simply go to the wedding and pretend like everything's cool. Because, to any outside observer, you're the unreasonable one here. They haven't seen all the situations that came before.

Ignore the symptom, treat the decease.", "Has your husband asked not to be paired with the ex? How they respond could go a long way toward uncovering whether this was done maliciously or just thoughtlessly.", "Nta.

It nbd so someone having a problem with it shouldn't be hard to resolve by just switching it up. \n\nThat said, I can't tell if OP has avtually expressed their discontent at the situation or if she's just brooding about it.

They hold hands... Adults can hold hands without cheating on their SO.", "Social stuff matters", "And if she pouts and stays home, he\u2019ll be alone with his ex all day.", "Exactly. This reeks of insecurity. Besides, even if OP stays home, it won't change the the outcome. Her husband will still be part of wedding party and he will still be walking with his ex beside him. Only his WIFE won't there for to have dinner with, or dance with, or eat cake with...she will be pouting at home. He will be spending the night sitting with friends who probably have him sitting next to ex because his WIFE didn't show.", "It's not that she doesn't trust her husband, I think it's the way that his friend group is strangely forcing this for no reason?

OP says this friend group, which includes the wedding couple, often reminisce fondly of the time that OP\u2019s husband and his ex were still together. OP feels that this is a calculated decision on the part of the wedding couple, and it does seem that way. Because it would just be so easy to have them walk with someone else. If OP\u2019s husband even hinted that he would prefer not to escort his ex down the aisle, only a bad friend would insist he must do so. If they know that it\u2019s going to make OP uncomfortable, why wouldn\u2019t they just switch the order of the wedding party slightly to make her comfortable? It really looks like this couple would prefer to make OP uncomfortable.\n\nI had a divorced couple in my wedding party. They were on friendly terms, but we still purposefully didn\u2019t force them to sit together or dance together or walk together, out of respect for them and their current partners.

Have you never heard of marriage by association? Mark my words, OPs husband & his ex will be together forever if they make that walk.", "Right? OP sounds insufferable. No wonder friends like the ex more", "This is insanity Op is definitely yta", "Wedding parties are typically paired up in the order in which they stand next to the bride/groom, so maid of honor + best man, #2 bridesmaid + #2 groomsman, so that then end up lining up in the order they\u2019ll be standing in.", "> Seriously, what is your issue here?. They will literally just be stood next to each other for a couple of minutes.\n\nAnd have formal photos taken together. And probably be in the wedding album if not on someone's wall. It is a bit weird and seems like a simple request to accommodate.", "It's hard to have faith in your partner when he lets his friends disrespect you, though, no?", "Nope because that's throwing his wife under the bus. Manning up is him taking full responsibility for the objection.", "One time my wife and I were both in the wedding party, but I guess the wedding planner didn't know we were married and set the pairs herself without consulting the bride and groom because we weren't paired with each other. We made it clear to the wedding planner that we were going to be walking together and she said she would tell the DJ, but then the DJ introduced us as the other people anyways.\n\nThat was a shitty wedding planner.", "You are so nta and your husband should be telling them to switch.", "I'm very curious whether they will be expected to sit together, away from OP, at the reception. \n\nThe most annoying part about this for OP will likely be the elderly people at the wedding who will probably keep remarking what a lovely couple OP's husband and ex make all night. Not a huge deal, but not a pleasant way to spend an evening, either?", "I don\u2019t think it has to do with trust. This just feels disrespectful on the part of the bridal couple.", "Ehhh. I\u2019m not seeing the issue of the exes walking necessarily as much as I see the calculatedness of how it\u2019s set up and how ops feelings are disregarded. It\u2019s a 90 second walk\u2026so why is it such a big deal to pair them with someone else? Talking about her partner and the ex fondly, especially with her right there\u2026sounds like quite a few people are still stuck in the past on her partner and his ex.", "It depends on the wedding. If they are doing one of those walk out dance routines at the wedding reception, it could be a lot more uncomfortable for OP.", "Um, normally you're partners with that person for the entire wedding,  including,  dancing, dinner, etc. So no I dont blame OP. And you don't know that she's insecure or jealous,  it's  the freaking principle! Its ridiculous and the bride and groom r making a mistake here.", "I think OP is actually worried about something else. She seems to feel like her husband\u2019s friends are still trying to set these two up despite him being married to her. It is likely not the case, but without knowing more about the history and the friend group, it is impossible to say for sure.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t see it as unreasonable to not want to see your husband walking down a wedding isle arm in arm with his ex. An isle in Target maybe, but not this.", "They share a friend group so surely because they are all friends, it shouldn't matter who walks with who and he can walk with another friend.", "> This seems so childish... walking down the aisle takes all of 90 seconds...\n\nYou might not care about this particular thing, but I feel like everybody, even you, would expect your partner to consider YOUR feelings on a matter and if it matters to YOU, that they would take it seriously. Even if they or Reddit thinks it's childish. Kind of the basis of a relationship, that sometimes you will do something simply for the sake of your partner. No, I'm not saying you should kill somebody for your wife, but I think this falls within the boundaries of normal human idiosyncratic preference.", "It the fact that this friend group speaks fondly of the times the old couple were together. That what would do it for me.", "But it\u2019s also standard for whomever you\u2019re paired with you do a dance with at the reception.", "R-E-S-P-E-K-T, find out what it means to me!\n\nAlso, agree with everyone here. Friends seem to view ex as the woman he should have married - they don't want to acknowledge the woman he did marry.", "Depending on his performance, sex could take only a minute. Would that be fine?\n\nClearly this is not about the action itself but the symbolism behind it.", "Just because its your wedding doesnt give you license to be an asshole. My husband is good friends with one of my good friend's ex boyfriend, both are now married to other people. Even though they were both in our wedding parties and on friendly terms I NEVER would have paired them together walking down the aisle, just because that is fucking weird and I think frankly sends a really unkind message to their new partners about how much you respect and value them. \n\nI dont understand how this is a trust issue; it's not like they're going to hook up on stage in front of the entire wedding. What I do think is shitty about it is an implied erasure of their new relationships and an insinuation that you preferred them together instead of with their new partners.", "Yeah, my only thought is the pictures of them walking down the aisle (that's if the wedding doesn't also include the more formal bridal party affairs). NTA.", "Never seen this.", "I agree! I don't see why they couldn't just swap him with someone else, either. Maybe the others are all couples or something. But it just feels like a nonissue either way to me. Everyone has different boundaries though, I get it.", "I've never been to a single wedding where any of that happened", "As others have said, I've definitely never seen the dance thing. Almost every wedding I've been to also had the bride and groom in the middle of a long table for dinner with the groomsmen on one side and the bridesmaids on the other. I don't think it's all that common to pair them up like that for dinner, but maybe I'm wrong.", "I had to do it at an aunt's wedding 8 was in a a kid. I had met the guy like the day before and had literally never danced with a guy before. \ud83d\ude05 We both looked around awkwardly and then just held hands and kind of swayed lol. It was very uncomfortable though.", "And even if that was a thing what are they going to do, force you? Just grab your wife or offer to take grandma for a spin on the floor or something.", "I used to see it when I was a kid but it hasn\u2019t really been a thing for 30 years or so", "Is this some sort of geographic thing? I've never seen that either. We just got married and definitely didn't do this.", "never in my life have i seen this. i'm in my 40's and been to dozens and dozens of weddings in the US and other countries.", "I have seen it. I\u2019ve also seen someone who wasn\u2019t in the wedding party get jealous because her husband was, and he had to dance with his paired bridesmaid and sit with her at the table and all that jazz. There was no call for the jealousy mind you, but it\u2019s also weird to me to effectively make people in your wedding party couples for the night \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But yeah people do it.", "That is a hard pass for me. It is a wedding not a dating game.", "> Be the more mature person and let the wedding play out the way the bride and groom want.\n> \n> Do you trust your husband or don't you?\n\nLouder for all the 'NTA' idiots in the back.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA, and you\u2019re handling this with absolute class and grace. Go and show them who the bigger person is, and if this is a malicious action on their part, then that will be on their conscience.  They\u2019re showing their true colors and I would imagine your husband will realize this and the friendship will eventually be affected by their actions. It\u2019s absolutely disrespectful towards you, but you can rise above all that. Don\u2019t let them get to you.  Good Luck, and go to that wedding, drink all the drinks, eat all the food and dance and have fun like none of this bothers you. That\u2019s your best revenge!", "Every single wedding I\u2019ve been to, halfway through the first dance, the bride and groom calls the rest of the guests to dance. It\u2019s definitely a thing.\n\nOp can show she isn\u2019t going to disappear by handling this with grace and maturity, by attending the wedding and not making a fuss. Her husband is walking down the aisle with this woman and sitting at a table with her. He can absolutely dance with OP, spend time with her. \n\nIf OP makes a fuss here, the bride and groom and whole core friend group will find out that she is jealous and insecure: and that isn\u2019t the power move that anyone wants it to be. This ex is around forever. Making it awkward will alienate OP.", "It's not about trusting her husband or not. It's a boundary. And it's totally justifiable. I wouldn't want my husband walking his ex down the aisle either. Kid or no kid, that's just weird.", "OP is reacting to the fact that the bride and groom prefer to imagine her husband and his ex as a unit and disregard OP's existence.\n\n>Everyone in the bridal party are all old friends and often talk about times that he and his ex were together fondly.\n\nBride and groom would probably prefer that OP stay home while they all relive the good old days when her husband and his ex were together. For that reason alone, I think OP should absolutely go to the wedding, dance with her husband, and make a point of being charming to his ex. \n\nNTA, but definitely go.", "It sounds to me like bride and groom are trying to get them back together, if they're all friends, talk about their time as a couple fondly, and are adamant about the pairing. Husband also doesn't want to walk with her. It's pretty disrespectful.", "They're fantasizing that the pair of their friends are still together.", "I wonder if the other bridesmaids/grooms are couples. Sounds like an older group.", "Hear me out, it might be due to aesthetic. Just a guess. I know several people who have their bridesmaids and groomsmen lined up a certain way due to height. If that's not the case, then I don't know know. Personally, I don't think it's that big of a deal to switch them. They are clearly in the same friend group and have a child together. A short walk down the aisle isn't going to make them want to be together again.", "IKR", "I mean once there's a clear source of discomfort the right thing to do would be switch things up and not cause troubles to your friend's marriage. The fact that they apparently refuse to do so points to malicious intent.", "That's a thing?", "I\u2019ve been in 3 weddings and all 3 there were multiple pics with my partner in the wedding and dances. So idk\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f If it\u2019s going to include all that I could see where OP needs to draw the line. Also her husband says he\u2019s uncomfortable with it as well. I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t just switch people. It\u2019s not that serious.", "They share a kid. They are family, even if they are exes. Why on earth would you marry someone who shares a family with their ex if you can't accept that they are going to have to talk to and get along with their ex?", "The problem is it\u2019s not just one minute, they also then later take pictures and do dances and walk in the reception later. It\u2019s more then just going down the isle. NTA", "Except he told OP that he's not comfortable with this either, but doesn't want to hurt anyone. I would say NTA and he needs to tell the couple to switch the marching order.", "It isn\u2019t only 90 seconds. They are in pictures together. They sit next to each other during the reception. They walk in together at the reception. The bridal party has a slow dance after bride and parents. The couple who is getting married should have the common sense not to pair them together.", "It's not just a 90 second walk down the aisle. Being in the wedding party usually requires time being spent for things leading up to the wedding, prep and I suspect a nice professional photo together.  Sounds like there is something more than nostalgia happening.", "I have a feeling that the bride and groom are doing this to get them back together.", "Op may be sensitive about it but her husband is also uncomfortable with it", "There will be pictures. This seems very calculated on the bride and groom\u2019s part unless all the other parties are paired up in relationships.", "Spoken like someone who has never been married", "Most of the weddings I've attended though the groom and bridesmaid that walk together are paired together for dinner and other assorted activities. It ends up being a lot more than just a few minutes", "That\u2019s not all it is though. It\u2019s the walk, pictures together, a dance.", "I think it is more of an issue because the entire wedding party are all old friends who reminisce about when these two were married so it does kind of sound like rubbing it in the new wife\u2019s face that they were together first. I\u2019m guessing if those memories were not always brought up OP may not have an issue", "I had a falling out with the bride a bit before her wedding. My SO was in the bridal party. I was very uncomfortable about all of it because the bride to be had pulled my SO aside (without me present) once at a birthday party and asked him if he was really happy being with me. Later, she confined in a mutual girlfriend that we \u201cwouldn\u2019t last long as a couple if she had anything to do with it\u201d. Later, the bride\u2019s only single bridesmaid (1 of 7 I think) sent him a friend request on instagram. I really struggled to decide if I would show up to this wedding or not. But I showed up and acted like nothing bothered me at all. Thankfully she had a mini wedding due to covid set backs, because she was planning a formal ceremony with the bridal party down the aisle and having a separate bridal party only table. It turned out I got to sit with my SO, which is all I wanted really. His entrance with was two bridesmaids due to the uneven number, and not the single-follow-request one. I am glad I went and acted like everything was just fine between me and the bride. I even hugged her and congratulated her at the end of the night even though I really really didn\u2019t want to. \nOP should go to the wedding, but I\u2019m sorry I think it\u2019s bullshit just because you\u2019re getting married you have free rein to push boundaries and make everyone else uncomfortable.", "Plus, sometimes it can go beyond walking down the aisle.  Are they paired up when they join the bride and groom on the dance floor after the bridal dance?  What about photos?\n\nIt doesn't need to add any stress to the bride and groom to be switched.  If there is no underlying meaning to them being paired up, then there is no point in insisting they are paired.", "The bride is an asshole. Why pair them? They can both be your friends, but they shouldn't be paired.  Why make it awkward for them. OP is fine. She should go to the wedding though. The bride is up to something. None of this seems like an accident.", "Then why would it matter if they were paired with other people? Why are the B & G making this a thing?", "And yet.. that is the way it is done... Unfortunately, I have been stuck with plenty of people in weddings, and was always happy when the first dance was over and done with.", "\u201cPeople don\u2019t hold their wedding party hostage\u201d made me actual lol. Have you not seen this sub in the last few days with wedding posts?", "Yes, this is extremely common, at least in the Northeast US", "From Pennsylvania and now live in New Jersey.. Every wedding has had the bridal party join bride and groom. Even at my cousin\u2019s wedding in California."]}
