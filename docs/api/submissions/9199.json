{"id": 9199, "submission_id": "10uhg3s", "title": "AITA for wearing a romper and not a dress at a wedding?", "selftext": "I (16 genderfluid) was recently at a close relative's wedding with my family (just guests, not as part of the bridal party or anything). The dress code the bride told us (and that was on the invite) was that women wore dresses and men had to wear something similarly formal e.g. a suit.\n\nI am AFAB so was told I would have to wear a dress. I don't identify as a woman however, so I wasn't comfortable with this and asked for a potential compromise on my outfit. She insisted that I wore a dress.\n\nCut to when my family were ordering their wedding clothes/figuring out their outfits. My parents asked if I had found anything suitable and I sent them a link to a romper that looks very much like a dress at first glance, it's genuinely not noticeable unless you look closely that the bottom part is not a skirt.\n\nWe got the romper, it arrives and everything is fine. I wore it to the wedding and for the first part everything seems ok, until I am pulled along too hard by a kid and end up tripping and falling face first, sprawled out on the floor. As everyone nearby gathers around to see what happened, the bride notices that the bottom part of my outfit is shorts and not a skirt, and loses her shit and starts screaming at me that she made it clear I needed to wear a dress and that I was being selfish by going against her wishes on her special day. I'm pretty sensitive and also hate loud noise as I'm autistic, so I start crying because the mix of pain from scraping my leg and her loud voice yelling is enough to overstimulate me pretty badly. My cousin leads me away to treat my wound, the bride stalks off still fuming and won't speak to us for the rest of the night until we eventually leave at the end of the wedding.\n\nI was reassured by some members of my family that I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm still super hung up over it and wondering if it was bad of me to wear that.\n\nI'm happy to provide a link to my outfit if anyone wants to see it to gauge for themselves.\n\nedit: [this](https://imgur.com/a/tMYgVFL) was what I wore\n\nedit 2: not attending wasn't really an option, she was marrying a close family member and we were pretty much expected to be there. my parents said that i needed to come as well\n\nedit 3: this is the most feminine item I own by far, and the discomfort is mainly subconscious with dysphoria and all, and the being forced into a gender binary when that's not who I am. plus, i enjoy the security of not worrying if my skirt will fly up in the wind. i would've much preferred a pantsuit or something but knew that wouldn't go so this was the closest thing to fitting dress-code i could find\n\nedit 4: i am perfectly fine with providing photos of the professional photo prints they had done of the event when they are ready (as evidence), it just might take a while", "created_utc": 1675616755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uhg3s/aita_for_wearing_a_romper_and_not_a_dress_at_a/", "score": 10938, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dress codes for non-wedding party members are usually for a level of formality, not a prescription for a particular article of clothing.

No, bride, you don't get to insist that women wear dresses versus a nice pants suit or a nice romper that looks like a dress.", "NTA. You did the best compromise you could, which is a romper. As someone who does identify as a woman, but doesn't like dresses, it totally makes sense that you did the best with what you had. Honestly the fact you found a rhomper that looks like a dress was very cool. \n\nIt's kind of weird that the bride was so hung up on you having to wear a dress. But your family also let you get the romper. So if your family is on your side, then you aren't TA. I'm sorry this happened, friend", "NTA. You found something that looked like a dress and prevented you from exposing yourself when you fell? \n\nSmart. \n\nAlso, gender specific dress codes are stupid. A dress code should specify the level of formality, and people should be able to wear whatever they feel comfortable in from that level.", "NTA. It looks like a nice outfit. Next wedding I might try to find something like that myself.", "NTA- can I have a link to this, it\u2019s so pretty!", "NTA looks very cute and like a dress. Bride is out of line for bullying a teenager for this", "Nta- she basically got mad cause you didn't moon everybody when you fell which is the only way she found out. Also it's nuts to decide all afab have to wear a dress. Even without the gender debate (cause clearly it is one with her) what if someone was just uncomfortable in them or for one reason or another couldn't wear one. Your romper was cute and you did nothing wrong. You find a compromise that she didn't even notice was one until you got hurt.", "NTA. Sorry, but demanding that someone who is not comfortable wearing a dress to wear one is just insane. Appropriate wedding attire in 2023 has to make room for something other than strictly binary clothing rules---especially when the bride knows a member of her family might struggle with such a dress code.", "NTA- can I have a link to this, it\u2019s so pretty!", "NTA - I\u2019m generally in favour of respecting dress code requests.  However this dress code was punitive IMO.  You also made a lot of effort to find an outfit that wasn\u2019t obviously outside of the dress code unless someone was obsessively checking outfits. The bride should be embarrassed and ashamed for making such a scene about it.", "NTA\n\nYou found a great compromise with that outfit - and quite frankly, you probably weren't the only one wearing shorts with a traditionally feminine looking outfit. Shorts under a dress to minimize chafing, to avoid flashing your family or just for comfort is pretty common.", "You're absolutely NTA. That romper was a very reasonable accommodation, and you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I thought it was a dress from the picture. That bride should have just said good compromise and moved on.", "NTA OP.\n\nFirst of all this is an autistic 16 year old that the bride chose to scream at when they fell instead of checking that they were ok. So the bride is an AH for that alone.\n\nSecondly I looked at the outfit the OP wore and it looks exactly like a dress!! It's beautiful, very dressy and obviously looked the part because no one noticed anything until OP fell. So it's a control thing with the bride because there was nothing wrong with how it looked.", "So the bride would have preferred if you showed your genitals to grandma? \n\nNTA some people are so out of touch", "NTA. Bride is just being a major bridezilla. It wasn\u2019t like you showed up to the wedding in sweat pants and a t shirt. The romper looked just fine", "NTA...what a bridezilla tantrum!\nI'm sure you looked adorable and were comfortable.\nYour family approved knowing the bride's dress code.\nSorry, but if I was your mom the bride and I would've had a very serious (probably loud) discussion over her bs tantrum at my child. You did nothing wrong, she was completely out of line.\nThe bride was a major AH.\nNot you.", "NTA had to look at that 3x before realizing it wasn't a dress. Even so there are plenty of wedding appropriate rompers", "NTA. Honestly that dress code is bullshit and feels like she was just targeting you bc she\u2019s uncomfortable with your identity. Wedding dress codes typically specify a level of formality (semi-formal, formal, cocktail, etc) and guests figure out what they want to wear within that category. There are fancy jumpsuits and pant suits cut for women that fit in each of those categories that anyone could wear and be dressed appropriately. If your romper was at the appropriate level of formality or dressiness, that should have been the end of question. \n\nHer then choosing to scream at you when she realized it was a romper only because you had fallen down is totally outrageous. I\u2019m sorry you experienced that.", "NTA the bride was completely unhinged. She can set a dress code (ie formal, semi formal) but does not get to dictate who wears dresses & suits.", "Wait, so you fell and the bride only noticed it wasn\u2019t a dress because you *didn\u2019t expose yourself to everyone*?? She would\u2019ve preferred that you were wearing a dress in that moment? Lol that\u2019s weird AF. Your outfit was a dress imo, just one that has built in shorts. And it came in pretty handy when you fell. If the bride had no problem until you were spared from flashing everyone, then  I find her outburst *really* strange. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s 2023. If I saw someone write \u201cwomen must wear dresses\u201d in the dress code I would probably never talk to that person again, gender identity aside. It\u2019s insane to tell women or people were AFAB that.", "OMG NTA. Bride sounds seriously deranged and she\u2019s the one who ruined the wedding by behaving like a complete nut job. \n\nI really dislike wedding guest dress codes. As if someone wearing something slightly different is going to make any difference to anyone. So I\u2019m already biased against this bride.", "NTA - nope - the bride worrying about what a kid is wearing to a wedding makes her a huge AH. She really should have been more concerned to see that you weren\u2019t injured. Dont worry, no one think youre an AH for this other than the bride who is herself an AH.", "First, cute romper.\nSecond, NTA. If you didn't have your accident, the bride would have never known, that you wore a romper. I hope you scrapes healed allright.", "NTA. \n\nThat outfit looks perfect for a wedding and I\u2019m sure you looked great. Bride\u2019s request was unreasonable. Plenty of cis women wear jumpsuits or similar to weddings rather than dresses; requiring a dress was unfair in the first place even if you weren\u2019t genderfluid but is especially insensitive in this scenario. Also, her reaction makes her sound like a toddler. Wildly disproportionate. \n\nTry to put it out of your head. I feel sorry for the spouse who has to put up with that behaviour. I imagine he might have had some second thoughts at that point.", "NTA holy crap what a miserable experience for you!\n\nIf you were in the bridal party I could understand the bride dictating what you wore (but I\u2019d still hope she would respect you enough to find a compromise), but as a guest it\u2019s really unreasonable, especially when demanding you wear something according to rules for a gender you don\u2019t identify with. \n\nSure, a dress code of some kind could make sense for the setting or theme (covered head or shoulders due to xyz religious requirements, garden party style, casual but no jeans, black tie, whatever). But to dictate exactly what type of garment each guest wears is pretty shocking. \n\nThe photo you shared is a really cute little outfit that definitely seems to fit the request the bride made while hopefully not triggering too much dysphoria for you if that\u2019s a thing you experience. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about it, you genuinely tried to be respectful and that alone should count for a lot. Sorry about your spoiled family member :-/", "NTA\n\nThe incorporated short legging was invisible, its comfort and modesty felt only to you, the wearer.\n\nFor the bride to look up your skirt, whilst on the floor, then see the legging and complain, is the same foul as if she had looked at your underwear and complained.\n\nYou did great.  The bride was horrid.", "NTA this bride has issues.", "NTA. I give that wedding a year tops.", "NTA at all, the bride is a spoilt brat and the romper is lovely and wedding appropriate", "NTA you wear what you feel comfortable in. You made the dress code work for you as much as possible (ridiculous as it was to implement) and no one noticed until the fall.\n\nWhat was the impact? Is she seriously angry that no one saw your underwear because it was a romper?", "NTA. That romper looks really pretty and without the fall, the bride probably wouldn't have even noticed the shorts. It's so awful that she immediately started yelling at you instead of being worried about you", "NTA\n\nSo the bride and groom set the dress-code level at cocktail attire. Rompers are 100% appropriate for cocktail attire, especially when accessorized properly.\n\nI\u2019ve even been to black tie events where women wear rompers. Black romper with classy AF shoes and jewelry? Absolutely stunning and appropriate as hell.", "NTA what a cute little outfit.", "NTA. How ridiculous to demand women wear dresses at this day and age (I sound old, I know). It\u2019s even more ridiculous that she got so angry at a technicality such as this.

She was mad because you essentially had shorts on under a dress. Which she only knew because you fell on the floor!", "Lmao if you think about it the bride is mad you didn't expose yourself to everyone when you fell, big ole YIKES.", "NTA\n\nThat damn well looks like a dress and secondly enforcing gender norms on others is gross", "NTA. You did more than enough to try to comply with the \u201cdress\u201d crap.", "NTA dear wonderful amazing human. You did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nGentle distance hugs.\n\nThe bridezilla on the other hand just alienated not just you, but I also suspect several in your family by her treatment of you.", "NTA and there is something deeply wrong with the bride.", "NTA, as a woman who loves wearing dresses to weddings, I always wear shorts underneath\u2026 it makes me feel more comfortable and confident.  The bride is being ridiculous- your outfit was a great choice and the fact that she only got mad when you fell and, I suppose, should have flashed everyone your underwear?? makes her the AH.", "NTA. Holy bridezilla, Batman.", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous that she was so upset over it, and frankly that she cared at all. When will people understand they can\u2019t dictate what others wear? You can ask politely but no one is under any obligation. At my wedding the best dressed guest was a stylish lady wearing a gorgeous salmon coloured sparkly pant suit - it was to die for. So relax!", "NTA.  I would have chosen the romper too...I don't think I've worn a dress/skirt willingly since I was 10.  LOL.  Don't know why, but I just don't feel comfortable wearing them.", "NTA. Dictating exactly what people wear is closer to a uniform policy, not a standard wedding dress code. Since the romper passed as a dress at first glance it should not be an issue. Modern dress codes should be making room for non-binary identities. Give her time- people get stressed and crazy when it comes to weddings. I hope she realizes she was over reacting.", "NTA- it sounds to me like you found a compromise and she never would have noticed it wasn't actually a dress if you hadn't fallen like that. She is the one who drew attention to it and made a scene-not you. I know plenty of people who've worn rompers to weddings. They actually can be quite dressy and nice.", "NTA! The romper is very cute and very appropriate for a wedding. You are correct that there is no way to tell is not a dress. The bride was acting like an unhinged Bridezilla.

When I saw the photo and read the title I figured the photo was a photo of a dress the bride asked you to wear, not the *romper* you did wear. I mean the whole dress code is bizarre, starting with the fact that you\u2019re not a fucking woman and ending with her ridiculous overreaction to finding out, halfway through an event and accidentally, that a guest was wearing a romper when she couldnt even tell.", "Besides the fact that the brides request is ridiculous: I\u2019d say it\u2019s more dress than a romper anyways. I have something that kinda looks like this and all it really is, is a dress with built-in panties.

You wore a romper. Big deal. It\u2019s not like you wore a white gown. Any bride who thinks she should get to dictate exactly what every guest wears down to the cut of the outfit is a bridezilla.

The dress code the bride told us was that women wore dresses and men had to wear something similarly formal e.g. a suit. \n\nI am AFAB so was told I would have to wear a dress. I don't identify as a woman however, so I wasn't comfortable with this and asked for a potential compromise on my outfit. She insisted that I wore a dress.\n\nCut to when my family were ordering their wedding clothes/figuring out their outfits. My parents asked if I had found anything suitable and I sent them a link to a romper that looks very much like a dress at first glance, it's genuinely not noticeable unless you look closely that the bottom part is not a skirt.\n\nWe got the romper, it arrives and everything is fine. I wore it to the wedding and for the first part everything seems ok, until I am pulled along too hard by a kid and end up tripping and falling face first, sprawled out on the floor. As everyone nearby gathers around to see what happened, the bride notices that the bottom part of my outfit is shorts and not a skirt, and loses her shit and starts screaming at me that she made it clear I needed to wear a dress and that I was being selfish by going against her wishes on her special day. I'm pretty sensitive and also hate loud noise as I'm autistic, so I start crying because the mix of pain from scraping my leg and her loud voice yelling is enough to overstimulate me pretty badly. My cousin leads me away to treat my wound, the bride stalks off still fuming and won't speak to us for the rest of the night until we eventually leave at the end of the wedding.\n\nI was reassured by some members of my family that I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm still super hung up over it and wondering if it was bad of me to wear that.\n\nI'm happy to provide a link to my outfit if anyone wants to see it to gauge for themselves.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Honestly the outfit is adorable I love it and it essentially met the code by looking like a dress and made you comfortable. The bride sounds unhinged and good luck to her husband coz he's gonna need it. Brides that go mental and scream at people for disobeying them or ruining their \"special day\" are usually extremely selfish and also ruin their own days by making fools of themselves.

Don't let it bother you if you can.  you've people reassure you that you've done nothing wrong and your parents approved the romper. I think you did great. Too bad about the injury.", "NTA. 1. She was an ignoramus about your gender choice, and 2. That's a dress for any sane person irrelevant of what's underneath.", "NTA. It looks like a dress, it\u2019s better than a dress due to the shorts to keep from flashing everyone while dancing and is likely more comfortable. Seems like it was a practical outfit.", "NTA It's a cute dress/romper, and if the bride is just being angry out of \"principle\" for such a minor thing, she can go to hell. \n\nThe most important is to look presentable, and you would definetly have done so in this one.", "NTA - Seriously, first off it's Brudezilla territory to dictate their guests clothing, so there's that. Second NEVER allow someone to misgender you. I am SO PROUD OF YOU for staying true to yourself. I'm sure you don't hear that enough. Lastly, it wasn't noticed until the point where *had* you been wearing a dress, the view would have been mortifying.

You\u2019re not in a position to just decline the invite because of this. If you were an adult you could have just skipped the event but I understand that was not realistic for you. Your parents approved the outfit and you went out of your way to try to accommodate the brides (unusual, it\u2019s more often just a level of formality) dress code. There was clearly no issue with your outfit until you fell so you must not have looked out of place. This is a control issue on the brides part. You\u2019re a nice person who did your best to adhere to a shitty dress code", "That outfit is gorgeous!

Since when did people start dictating what guests where to a wedding???  NTA", "Telling all women they must wear a dress is some misogynistic bullshit. Bride is totally TA", "NTA. The romper is really cute and the bride sounds like she was being a bridezilla.

The bride was bang out of order with those requests and that treatment of you.", "Not The Asshole. That was a cute ass romper and there was literally nothing wrong with wearing it.", "NTA. Formal rompers are a thing. My feminine, cis female friend wore a romper to a wedding last year and it looked great. This is wildly controlling behavior from the bride.", "NTA at all", "Honestly, ESH, soft in your direction and strong in the brides direction.\n\nI know imma get downvoted for that, but you asked the bride and she told you in no uncertain terms that you had to wear a dress.\n\nYou should have sorted this out before going there (for example telling your parents that you don\u2019t feel comfortable in a dress and having them talk to the bride about the romper)\n\nYes I think it\u2019s ridiculous that brides want to dictate to everyone what they\u2019re allowed to wear, and yes her reaction was really mean and uncalled for.\n\nBut if someone asked me what I wanted them to wear and I told them it had to be a dress and they would show up in something else I\u2019d feel like I\u2019m being made fun of.", "NTA.

That's what one of my daughters wear, and it is a very sharp look.\n\nIt just seems with the overt feminity of the romper that it wasn't technically a dress seems more like splitting hairs to make a point than an expression of your identity.

So the answer was simply don't go, don't go to places that aren't excepting of you.\n\nWhat you did was plan an action of defiance and choose to rebel, then cried and played the victim when they reacted the way we all know they would.\n\n\nFor example I, at 16, didn't go to my mom's wedding because I didn't want to wear dress pants as they make my legs itch....

No. I just sighed and carry the grudge to this day.", "NTA - you should have been allowed to wear a romper or at least a suit and she shouldn\u2019t have dictated things to such a degree especially given you were not in the wedding party. \nThe fact the one you choose wasn\u2019t even noticeable as being a romper until you fell should have been more than acceptable and was a gracious compromise for you to make.\nThe bride could have said nothing but instead decided to cause a scene.", "Bridezilla also sounds like she might be a bit of a bigot, since OP is openly afab and bridezilla sounds like she\u2019s pushing this dress code to conform to gender roles.", "NTA, the brides upset you didn't expose yourself to the entire audience when you tripped? Surely there's bigger things to focus on during your wedding day. Don't worry about it you did nothing wrong she clearly has anger issues.", "NTA.

You were comfy, your mom approved of your clothing choice as wedding-appropriate. Don't let that woman live rent-free in your head! \n\nNTA", "NTA the rule was in place to be to be controlling and transphobic.

I wear men's suits for formal events. Not pantsuits -- men's suits, from the men's section. I wouldn't have gone to this wedding if I wasn't allowed that freedom. If I had to wear a dress, or even the romper you wore, I would hardly have been able to talk to people. It would've ruined my psychological state for the entire day, probably longer. I would look back on her wedding in utter misery, every time I had the misfortune of remembering it. Straight gender-conforming people, ask yourselves, is this really the memories you want your family to have of your wedding? You may think I am being overdramatic, but this is just what it's like to be gender nonconforming. Dysphoria is real. The truly overdramatic ones are the people who care so much about what OTHER PEOPLE wear! If it's really so important to them, I will gladly stay home. But I realize OP felt obligated to go especially being 16 and at the behest of their parents. Well, I think they found THE perfect solution. That romper is 100% femme and looks exactly like a dress. The way I see it, you went the extra mile to find something that worked for both of you and she should be grateful. Straight people can be such ignorant assholes.", "NTA, and congrat for making her day worse, she deserve it tbh", "NTA\nThe bride for one sounds insane, and 2 is a straight up bigot.

Now can someone tell me where it says a romper is not a dress and a skirt dress is the only kind of dress? NTA.", "That romper is beautiful!", "Soft YTA because you're a teenager, but your gender identity doesn't matter here. Some events require specific clothes, and weddings are one of them.

One day in a dress won't kill you, whatever your identity.", "NTA. \n\n\n\nThe bulk of my skirts have shorts sewn in and I always wear some kind of compression shorts or other garment to prevent chaffing under dresses.

This is a dress, in my opinion. The only difference from a dress is that your panties weren't exposed when you fell! Is that what offended the bride, she wanted to see the panties?", "NTA at all. This is an absurd requirement\u2014a dress code should pretty much begin and end with a particular level of formality.

What one is left wondering where was the groom in all of this? Was he not talking to you either?", "NTA. This beyond inappropriate. No bride should be telling others what they can or can\u2019t wear to this degree. A dress code is one thing, but this is crazy. I am female and I don\u2019t wear dresses period. I would have showed up in pants and she could just deal with it. All of that craziness is for an overpriced party.", "NTA. SHE DIDNT EVEN NOTICE UNTIL YOU FELL AND SHE DIDNT SEE YOUR UNDERGARMENTS.

It's so cute and I want one lol", "That is a very feminine outfit, I can\u2019t see why the bride would have a problem with it. I think is was very generous of you to wear something so feminine.", "NTA honestly i wouldn't have been even able to tell it wasnt a dress so i dont know what her problem is. sounds like transphobia (if you're out) or she's being a bridezilla", "I'm gender fluid/androgynous and quite honestly if someone told me I HAD to wear a dress to a wedding, I would have shown up in a full tuxedo PANT suit just to call them out on their bigotry.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not a woman, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to adhere to the women\u2019s dress code.

You were dressed in formal attire that took a major trip & fall to reveal the built in shorts.

I wear nike pros under my dresses if I think I might flash someone in it.

Makes me think the groom should be very very worried about his choice of bride.", "nta!!!", "NTA. It looks like a dress and if there hadn\u2019t been the accident with the kid, no one would have known.

I had a similar experience at an old workplace before coming out as trans (I'm afab too). I worked at a family farm attraction and we were expected to dress up for the week of Halloween. Only issue was that we didn't have a choice - it was either a witch or a wizard depending on your gender. I was already out to my family and friends, just not at work. So I had to wear a spooky dress and a wig. I was already feeling so uncomfortable with the whole outfit, and on top of it the first day of the event we had big issues with our check-in system and we were fully booked. I ended up having a full blown panic attack, ran away from the front desk and basically tore my outfit off and got back in my uniform, sobbing.

At all.\nMy little boy has long hair, and likes to wear frills. He is also autistic, and has some big issues with clothing. I would be damned if someone tried to force him to wear something he is uncomfortable in. Wedding or not.  He can do like you did, and will find something that fits the theme without making him uncomfortable.\n\n\nThat romper is adorable. And yes, it absolutely looks like a dress. That should be good enough. \nIt's not like you showed up in a tight jumpsuit, or a suit. (even then, I feel like a suit should have been fine)\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong, OP. She is just an over the top bridezilla.", "NTA. Also I know LOTS of people who identify as woman who have no interest, or downright HATE to wear dresses.

Like common, it was literally a blessing in disguise that your outfit had shorts at the bottom.", "NTA. It looks like a dress and good thing it was romper because that would have been awful to experience. I also don't understand the bride mad at a kid for not ending up showing their underwear.", "NTA. \n\nShe couldn\u2019t even tell it wasn\u2019t a dress (cause it\u2019s fitting for a wedding) so what was the real problem? Her control issues maybe? Sorry OP, you were wrongfully screamed at over nothing. And you didn\u2019t even flash people so yay!", "Maybe I\u2019m just that jaded, but I\u2019m wondering if the dress code was specifically aimed at you. NTA I personally prefer skorts, myself. I\u2019m not sure what the bride\u2019s hangup is.", "NTA. I am currently trying to navigate this issue myself as a queer bridesmaid. I asked the bride if I could wear a jumpsuit instead of a dress; she let me try on a couple jumpsuits (including one that I *adore*) but later decided that I *have* to wear a dress for no real reason. The worst part is that now, after seeing how good I looked in the jumpsuit, she wants the \u201cbest man\u201d (who is a *woman*) to wear it. What a slap in the face.\n\nEDIT: That romper is SO cute! I bet you looked great. :)", "At first I was on the fence because a romper is very different than a dress and I would usually say you should respect the dress code. \n\nSeeing what you chose though, I think you did an excellent job in choosing what to wear. \n\nAlso regardless of what you wore the bride had no right to scream at you.

The fact that it took that long AND an unforeseen accident for anyone to even notice it wasn\u2019t a dress (and it seriously looks like a dress) means that it should not have been an issue.

We are talking about how to dress for certain occasions. A wedding is a formal event and a romper is not formal attire. Are you an asshole? Probably not unless you dressed in casual attire for a formal event with the intent to be disrespectful. Were you?

As long as the romper wasn\u2019t white or unreasonably short, it\u2019s really not up to her to dictate what you wear. Also, you\u2019re 16, so for someone your age, this is absolutely an appropriate outfit for a wedding. And your parents should have defended you in the moment. It is completely inappropriate that\u2019s grown adult spoke to you and made you feel that way. \n\nSide note: I love wearing dresses, but have chubby thighs that chafe.

Not only did you not rebel in an obvious manner to her request (I've seen so many posts where this was not the case and scenes turn into malicious compliance or outright selfishness on behalf of the attendee), but you spared her a moment of stealing her show by flashing your teen panties.

Imagine going ass over tea kettle and only having underwear on! Would have been far more embarrassing. I hope as you get older you realize you can say no to people.

I personally think the only decent way to deal with such things would be to preemptively speak to the other guests and get them to behave regardless of what you wore, but not everyone thinks that way. \n\nWhat you wore was perfectly appropriate for a young adult attending a wedding. I think the bride is being unreasonable suggesting otherwise. The proof that it wasn\u2019t a problem is that the only reason it became an issue was because you fell over- prior to that she was happy with your appearance. \n\nHope you weren\u2019t hurt in your fall and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got anything to worry about here.", "NTA.

There are a few options here. (1) she really is transphobic, and just hid it previously (possible), (2) she's overall NOT really a nice person (kinda goes along with #1), and (3) she usually IS a nice person, but - and i tell you this truthfully - nothing brings out the worst in people like a wedding. \n\nSeriously. Having spent years as security, one if the first things I would check for in a venue is if they were going to have a wedding the day we were supposed to be there. If so, we'd relocate to a totally different part of the venue. Bunch of family together, history together, baggage together, emotions at the surface, add alcohol and shake. Didn't GUARANTEE there'd be a problem if a wedding was in the area, but from a security standpoint we'd avoid them like the plague. Cuz people at weddings - especially brides, less so grooms - also guests, tend to lose their darn minds. Dunno why. \n\nBut now she's gone and embarrassed herself in front if everyone who knows her. No one takes that well. And if she isn't a very good person, she will likely blame you for it rather than the person who ought to take the blame - herself. And she's the one who's going to have to work through that. It's not your fault, but she may try to make it your problem. Just disregard her until she comes to her senses. If you can do that, then it's neither your fault NOR your problem. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI wasn't kidding about wanting to know where you got that romper, btw.... \ud83e\udd23 it would look great on my daughter.

Besides, the whole \u201cdresses for women suits for men\u201d is outdated and restrictive, she could achieve the same thing by specifying \u201cformal wear\u201d or something like that, the majority of women/men would still choose to wear dresses/suits respectively, but those who are not comfortable with that would be free to choose something else that still fits the formal dress code, but that they are comfortable wearing.

You definitely tried to make it work and she is the asshole for making a big deal about it and causing you the humiliation after you already tripped, instead of asking you if you were okay and helping you up.

We had our wedding in the country, so some family friends came in suits, others in uniform, and some were in dirty overalls and wranglers with boots and a hat. At the end of the day, we were happy that everyone came as they were and enjoyed the potluck!", "NTA you found a lovely compromise and the bride is being unreasonable. I can\u2019t imagine carrying that much about what a guest wore to my wedding unless they were straight up wearing a bridal gown. Bride needs to grow up. What you wore was perfectly appropriate.

Keep all the specific clothing requests to the wedding party, not guests. Asking people to wear formal attire is fine. Requiring dresses is weird.", "I'm honestly flabbergasted as to what the bride would have preferred in that situation. Had OP been wearing a skirt bottom, their undergarments would have been on full display for all to see, very embarrassing for them. Had the bride even asked how OP was, did they hurt themselves? Or did she start screaming right off - by the way the story is told, I presume the latter. \nHonestly - strict dress codes for a wedding for guests are unnecessary. No formal jumpsuits or pant suits for women would have been allowed either, just why?

The only people with a dress code was the wedding party, which I suppose was fairly traditional.", "My brothers wedding was semi-formal.  He asked very nicely for his sisters to wear floor length dresses (not everyone was asked or expected to).  We all happily complied.

One member of the wedding party wore jeans, but it was his decision to risk getting soping wet. The funny thing is I got to enjoy my wedding and I am still on speaking terms with my loved ones. We invited our loved ones as they are and not how we think they should be.\n\nNTA, and I do not understand why this bride was willing to ruin her enjoyment of her own wedding by fuming over the betrayal that she did not get to see up your skirt.

My 7 year old cousin has sensory issues and can\u2019t wear jeans, rarely wears anything other than dresses, and loves to sing.
