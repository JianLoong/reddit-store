The dress code the bride told us (and that was on the invite) was that women wore dresses and men had to wear something similarly formal e.g. a suit.\n\nI am AFAB so was told I would have to wear a dress. I don't identify as a woman however, so I wasn't comfortable with this and asked for a potential compromise on my outfit. She insisted that I wore a dress.\n\nCut to when my family were ordering their wedding clothes/figuring out their outfits. My parents asked if I had found anything suitable and I sent them a link to a romper that looks very much like a dress at first glance, it's genuinely not noticeable unless you look closely that the bottom part is not a skirt.\n\nWe got the romper, it arrives and everything is fine. I wore it to the wedding and for the first part everything seems ok, until I am pulled along too hard by a kid and end up tripping and falling face first, sprawled out on the floor. As everyone nearby gathers around to see what happened, the bride notices that the bottom part of my outfit is shorts and not a skirt, and loses her shit and starts screaming at me that she made it clear I needed to wear a dress and that I was being selfish by going against her wishes on her special day. I'm pretty sensitive and also hate loud noise as I'm autistic, so I start crying because the mix of pain from scraping my leg and her loud voice yelling is enough to overstimulate me pretty badly. My cousin leads me away to treat my wound, the bride stalks off still fuming and won't speak to us for the rest of the night until we eventually leave at the end of the wedding.\n\nI was reassured by some members of my family that I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm still super hung up over it and wondering if it was bad of me to wear that.\n\nI'm happy to provide a link to my outfit if anyone wants to see it to gauge for themselves.\n\nedit: [this](https://imgur.com/a/tMYgVFL) was what I wore\n\nedit 2: not attending wasn't really an option, she was marrying a close family member and we were pretty much expected to be there. my parents said that i needed to come as well", "created_utc": 1675616755, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uhg3s/aita_for_wearing_a_romper_and_not_a_dress_at_a/", "score": 724, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, bride, you don't get to insist that women wear dresses versus a nice pants suit or a nice romper that looks like a dress.", "NTA. You did the best compromise you could, which is a romper. As someone who does identify as a woman, but doesn't like dresses, it totally makes sense that you did the best with what you had. Honestly the fact you found a rhomper that looks like a dress was very cool. \n\nIt's kind of weird that the bride was so hung up on you having to wear a dress. But your family also let you get the romper. So if your family is on your side, then you aren't TA. I'm sorry this happened, friend", "NTA. You found something that looked like a dress and prevented you from exposing yourself when you fell? \n\nSmart. \n\nAlso, gender specific dress codes are stupid. A dress code should specify the level of formality, and people should be able to wear whatever they feel comfortable in from that level.", "NTA. It looks like a nice outfit. Next wedding I might try to find something like that myself.", "NTA- can I have a link to this, it\u2019s so pretty!", "NTA looks very cute and like a dress. Bride is out of line for bullying a teenager for this", "Nta- she basically got mad cause you didn't moon everybody when you fell which is the only way she found out. Also it's nuts to decide all afab have to wear a dress. Even without the gender debate (cause clearly it is one with her) what if someone was just uncomfortable in them or for one reason or another couldn't wear one. Your romper was cute and you did nothing wrong. You find a compromise that she didn't even notice was one until you got hurt.", "NTA. Sorry, but demanding that someone who is not comfortable wearing a dress to wear one is just insane. Appropriate wedding attire in 2023 has to make room for something other than strictly binary clothing rules---especially when the bride knows a member of her family might struggle with such a dress code.", "NTA- can I have a link to this, it\u2019s so pretty!", "NTA - I\u2019m generally in favour of respecting dress code requests.  However this dress code was punitive IMO.  You also made a lot of effort to find an outfit that wasn\u2019t obviously outside of the dress code unless someone was obsessively checking outfits. The bride should be embarrassed and ashamed for making such a scene about it.", "NTA\n\nYou found a great compromise with that outfit - and quite frankly, you probably weren't the only one wearing shorts with a traditionally feminine looking outfit. Shorts under a dress to minimize chafing, to avoid flashing your family or just for comfort is pretty common.", "You're absolutely NTA. That romper was a very reasonable accommodation, and you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I thought it was a dress from the picture. That bride should have just said good compromise and moved on.", "NTA OP.\n\nFirst of all this is an autistic 16 year old that the bride chose to scream at when they fell instead of checking that they were ok. So the bride is an AH for that alone.\n\nSecondly I looked at the outfit the OP wore and it looks exactly like a dress!! It's beautiful, very dressy and obviously looked the part because no one noticed anything until OP fell. So it's a control thing with the bride because there was nothing wrong with how it looked.", "So the bride would have preferred if you showed your genitals to grandma? \n\nNTA some people are so out of touch", "NTA. Bride is just being a major bridezilla. It wasn\u2019t like you showed up to the wedding in sweat pants and a t shirt. The romper looked just fine", "NTA...what a bridezilla tantrum!\nI'm sure you looked adorable and were comfortable.\nYour family approved knowing the bride's dress code.\nSorry, but if I was your mom the bride and I would've had a very serious (probably loud) discussion over her bs tantrum at my child. You did nothing wrong, she was completely out of line.\nThe bride was a major AH.\nNot you.", "NTA had to look at that 3x before realizing it wasn't a dress. Even so there are plenty of wedding appropriate rompers", "NTA. Honestly that dress code is bullshit and feels like she was just targeting you bc she\u2019s uncomfortable with your identity. Wedding dress codes typically specify a level of formality (semi-formal, formal, cocktail, etc) and guests figure out what they want to wear within that category. There are fancy jumpsuits and pant suits cut for women that fit in each of those categories that anyone could wear and be dressed appropriately. If your romper was at the appropriate level of formality or dressiness, that should have been the end of question. \n\nHer then choosing to scream at you when she realized it was a romper only because you had fallen down is totally outrageous. I\u2019m sorry you experienced that.", "NTA the bride was completely unhinged. She can set a dress code (ie formal, semi formal) but does not get to dictate who wears dresses & suits.", "Wait, so you fell and the bride only noticed it wasn\u2019t a dress because you *didn\u2019t expose yourself to everyone*?? She would\u2019ve preferred that you were wearing a dress in that moment? Lol that\u2019s weird AF. Your outfit was a dress imo, just one that has built in shorts. And it came in pretty handy when you fell. If the bride had no problem until you were spared from flashing everyone, then  I find her outburst *really* strange. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s 2023. If I saw someone write \u201cwomen must wear dresses\u201d in the dress code I would probably never talk to that person again, gender identity aside. It\u2019s insane to tell women or people were AFAB that.", "OMG NTA. Bride sounds seriously deranged and she\u2019s the one who ruined the wedding by behaving like a complete nut job. \n\nI really dislike wedding guest dress codes. As if someone wearing something slightly different is going to make any difference to anyone. So I\u2019m already biased against this bride.", "NTA - nope - the bride worrying about what a kid is wearing to a wedding makes her a huge AH. She really should have been more concerned to see that you weren\u2019t injured. Dont worry, no one think youre an AH for this other than the bride who is herself an AH.", "First, cute romper.\nSecond, NTA. If you didn't have your accident, the bride would have never known, that you wore a romper. I hope you scrapes healed allright.", "NTA. \n\nThat outfit looks perfect for a wedding and I\u2019m sure you looked great. Bride\u2019s request was unreasonable. Plenty of cis women wear jumpsuits or similar to weddings rather than dresses; requiring a dress was unfair in the first place even if you weren\u2019t genderfluid but is especially insensitive in this scenario. Also, her reaction makes her sound like a toddler. Wildly disproportionate. \n\nTry to put it out of your head. I feel sorry for the spouse who has to put up with that behaviour. I imagine he might have had some second thoughts at that point.", "NTA holy crap what a miserable experience for you!\n\nIf you were in the bridal party I could understand the bride dictating what you wore (but I\u2019d still hope she would respect you enough to find a compromise), but as a guest it\u2019s really unreasonable, especially when demanding you wear something according to rules for a gender you don\u2019t identify with. \n\nSure, a dress code of some kind could make sense for the setting or theme (covered head or shoulders due to xyz religious requirements, garden party style, casual but no jeans, black tie, whatever). But to dictate exactly what type of garment each guest wears is pretty shocking. \n\nThe photo you shared is a really cute little outfit that definitely seems to fit the request the bride made while hopefully not triggering too much dysphoria for you if that\u2019s a thing you experience. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about it, you genuinely tried to be respectful and that alone should count for a lot. Sorry about your spoiled family member :-/", "NTA\n\nThe incorporated short legging was invisible, its comfort and modesty felt only to you, the wearer.\n\nFor the bride to look up your skirt, whilst on the floor, then see the legging and complain, is the same foul as if she had looked at your underwear and complained.\n\nYou did great.  The bride was horrid.", "NTA this bride has issues.", "NTA. I give that wedding a year tops.", "NTA at all, the bride is a spoilt brat and the romper is lovely and wedding appropriate", "NTA you wear what you feel comfortable in. You made the dress code work for you as much as possible (ridiculous as it was to implement) and no one noticed until the fall.\n\nWhat was the impact? Is she seriously angry that no one saw your underwear because it was a romper?", "NTA. That romper looks really pretty and without the fall, the bride probably wouldn't have even noticed the shorts. It's so awful that she immediately started yelling at you instead of being worried about you", "NTA\n\nSo the bride and groom set the dress-code level at cocktail attire. Rompers are 100% appropriate for cocktail attire, especially when accessorized properly.\n\nI\u2019ve even been to black tie events where women wear rompers. Black romper with classy AF shoes and jewelry? Absolutely stunning and appropriate as hell.", "NTA what a cute little outfit.", "NTA. How ridiculous to demand women wear dresses at this day and age (I sound old, I know). It\u2019s even more ridiculous that she got so angry at a technicality such as this. The outfit you wore is very cute and quite appropriate for a wedding.", "NTA & That romper is ADORABLE!!! \ud83e\udd29", "NTA and that\u2019s a very nice romper!!", "Your outfit looks absolutely fine for a wedding, and the bride sounds like an absolute bridezilla.

She was mad because you essentially had shorts on under a dress. Which she only knew because you fell on the floor!", "Lmao if you think about it the bride is mad you didn't expose yourself to everyone when you fell, big ole YIKES.", "NTA\n\nThat damn well looks like a dress and secondly enforcing gender norms on others is gross", "NTA. You did more than enough to try to comply with the \u201cdress\u201d crap.", "NTA dear wonderful amazing human. You did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nGentle distance hugs.\n\nThe bridezilla on the other hand just alienated not just you, but I also suspect several in your family by her treatment of you.", "NTA and there is something deeply wrong with the bride.", "NTA, as a woman who loves wearing dresses to weddings, I always wear shorts underneath\u2026 it makes me feel more comfortable and confident.  The bride is being ridiculous- your outfit was a great choice and the fact that she only got mad when you fell and, I suppose, should have flashed everyone your underwear?? makes her the AH.", "NTA. Holy bridezilla, Batman.", "NTA that\u2019s ridiculous that she was so upset over it, and frankly that she cared at all. When will people understand they can\u2019t dictate what others wear? You can ask politely but no one is under any obligation. At my wedding the best dressed guest was a stylish lady wearing a gorgeous salmon coloured sparkly pant suit - it was to die for. So relax!", "NTA.  I would have chosen the romper too...I don't think I've worn a dress/skirt willingly since I was 10.  LOL.  Don't know why, but I just don't feel comfortable wearing them.", "NTA. Dictating exactly what people wear is closer to a uniform policy, not a standard wedding dress code. Since the romper passed as a dress at first glance it should not be an issue. Modern dress codes should be making room for non-binary identities. Give her time- people get stressed and crazy when it comes to weddings. I hope she realizes she was over reacting.", "NTA- it sounds to me like you found a compromise and she never would have noticed it wasn't actually a dress if you hadn't fallen like that. She is the one who drew attention to it and made a scene-not you. I know plenty of people who've worn rompers to weddings. They actually can be quite dressy and nice.", "NTA! The romper is very cute and very appropriate for a wedding. You are correct that there is no way to tell is not a dress. The bride was acting like an unhinged Bridezilla. Instead of being concerned about your being injured, she was upset she couldn't see your underwear (because that's the only way she knew it wasn't a dress)?

You just unfortunately encounter a MASSIVE FUCKING BRIDEZILLA", "NTA. That\u2019s a really cute romper", "NTA \n\nThere is not a single thing wrong with what you wore. The wedding sounds like a terrible experience and I'm sorry you had to go through it. I hope she's not someone you have to see often.", "NTa.  She ruined her own wedding, not you.", "Lmao NTA at all. When I saw the photo and read the title I figured the photo was a photo of a dress the bride asked you to wear, not the *romper* you did wear. I mean the whole dress code is bizarre, starting with the fact that you\u2019re not a fucking woman and ending with her ridiculous overreaction to finding out, halfway through an event and accidentally, that a guest was wearing a romper when she couldnt even tell.", "Besides the fact that the brides request is ridiculous: I\u2019d say it\u2019s more dress than a romper anyways. I have something that kinda looks like this and all it really is, is a dress with built-in panties.

You wore a romper. Big deal. It\u2019s not like you wore a white gown. Any bride who thinks she should get to dictate exactly what every guest wears down to the cut of the outfit is a bridezilla.

So I had to wear a spooky dress and a wig. I was already feeling so uncomfortable with the whole outfit, and on top of it the first day of the event we had big issues with our check-in system and we were fully booked. I ended up having a full blown panic attack, ran away from the front desk and basically tore my outfit off and got back in my uniform, sobbing.

Imagine going ass over tea kettle and only having underwear on! Would have been far more embarrassing. I hope as you get older you realize you can say no to people.

I personally think the only decent way to deal with such things would be to preemptively speak to the other guests and get them to behave regardless of what you wore, but not everyone thinks that way. \n\nWhat you wore was perfectly appropriate for a young adult attending a wedding. I think the bride is being unreasonable suggesting otherwise. The proof that it wasn\u2019t a problem is that the only reason it became an issue was because you fell over- prior to that she was happy with your appearance. \n\nHope you weren\u2019t hurt in your fall and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got anything to worry about here.", "NTA.

There are a few options here. (1) she really is transphobic, and just hid it previously (possible), (2) she's overall NOT really a nice person (kinda goes along with #1), and (3) she usually IS a nice person, but - and i tell you this truthfully - nothing brings out the worst in people like a wedding. \n\nSeriously. Having spent years as security, one if the first things I would check for in a venue is if they were going to have a wedding the day we were supposed to be there. If so, we'd relocate to a totally different part of the venue. Bunch of family together, history together, baggage together, emotions at the surface, add alcohol and shake. Didn't GUARANTEE there'd be a problem if a wedding was in the area, but from a security standpoint we'd avoid them like the plague. Cuz people at weddings - especially brides, less so grooms - also guests, tend to lose their darn minds. Dunno why. \n\nBut now she's gone and embarrassed herself in front if everyone who knows her. No one takes that well. And if she isn't a very good person, she will likely blame you for it rather than the person who ought to take the blame - herself. And she's the one who's going to have to work through that. It's not your fault, but she may try to make it your problem. Just disregard her until she comes to her senses. If you can do that, then it's neither your fault NOR your problem. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI wasn't kidding about wanting to know where you got that romper, btw.... \ud83e\udd23 it would look great on my daughter.

Besides, the whole \u201cdresses for women suits for men\u201d is outdated and restrictive, she could achieve the same thing by specifying \u201cformal wear\u201d or something like that, the majority of women/men would still choose to wear dresses/suits respectively, but those who are not comfortable with that would be free to choose something else that still fits the formal dress code, but that they are comfortable wearing.

I've never actually seen that before and specifically searching for a formal romper yielded no results. formal jumpsuits are a whole thing but rompers? searching for \"wedding romper\" btw produces a slew of rompers intended to be substitutes for wedding dresses but almost all of them are decidedly not formal wear. most of them are for casual weddings or beach weddings or at best, semi-formal attire  \n\nsecondly the clothing was decidedly not an issue given that no one even noticed it *was* a romper. if you can't tell that someone's clothing doesn't break dress code until they fall down and you can the secret shorts hidden beneath the ruffles, then it's really not an issue  \n\nit's like being mad that you can't see up someone's skirt when they fall and you suddenly discover they were wearing a skort and not a skirt. or were wearing shorts under their dress for comfort   \n\nif everyone sees you in your clothing and thinks it's appropriate until they learn the technical details of your outfit that aren't visible - your outfit was fine and they're having a temper tantrum for no reason  \n\nyou get to set a dress code for your wedding sure, absolutely. you can set a colour scheme. your wedding can require particular cultural or religious wear. and people who don't want to meet any of those requirements can simply skip your wedding  \n\nbut this is so far past any of the basic reasonable clothing requirements you can set for an event that it's not funny  \n\nand that's without even touching that what's driving this is CLEARLY transphobia and that this is an adult lashing out at a child\n\nlike so fucking night and day it's unreal", "Very different circumstances, but it is kind of a funny coincidence they were posted so close to each other.", "Was there something else going on when she wrote out a dresses only dress code on the invitation and told a gender fluid guest they had to wear a dress? Because her decisions and behavior were horrible then too. \n\nAlso \u201ca little over the top\u201d?? She screamed at an injured guest and gave them the silent treatment all night.", "You're right; it's transphobia", "Transphobia", "Fair enough, kinda think homophobia also encompasses, but you\u2019re right. Take your pick, I guess.", "it's really good, the fabric had a nice texture but we did need to steam it out cos it came pretty wrinkled\n\ni've got a couple other items from there as well and they've all been nice so far!", "Thanks", "I just don't think it's on a 16yo to negotiate with a bridezilla. They did her best to hide that they were wearing basically a skort, (shorts skirt thing) and the parents bought it. I think bridezilla is in the wrong in general but the parents are wrong for not discussing this with her and approving the garment (which is cute af btw)", "I would agree. I don't know obviously, but as a previous 16yo, I didn't have much choice in those things at that age.", "I dunno, this feels specifically like transphobia to me, particularly the must wear a dress, non-binary identity not accepted. I don't think she'd've flipped if it was a dress with feminine underwear underneath.\n\nNTA for sure.", "She's not happy because she had secretly been gloating that she had perfectly controlled all the pieces in her mental chess match.\n\nAnd then one piece only pretended to be controlled!? The audacity. \n\nWhen your personality rests on your ego it's hard to relate to those that don't make you the center of their world.", "Sounds like the bride is transphobic. There would be nothing wrong with a cis woman wearing a formal pantsuit to a wedding. It sounds like the dresses/pants thing was done specifically to force OP to dress according to her assigned gender.", "Well, the bride didn\u2019t care if OP was hurt or embarrassed, she was only concerned with having total control and dominion over her dream wedding.", "Right? What would the bride have done if say OP wore boxer shorts under a dress- like me and my friends did when we were teens wearing our uniform skirts in high school", "Yes! I love it! \n\nNTA!", "Like I said, I did miss that OP was 16.  I do think at 16 it wouldn\u2019t be weird for OP to try to handle this personally, but the parents had the ultimate responsibility here since OP was a minor.\n\nI would like to emphasize that I do think the bride could have, and should have, on a \u201cdecent person\u201d level, been more open to compromise.\n\nHowever, the people throwing the party have ultimate say under what conditions they want people to enjoy their hospitality.  If my aunt has a party and the invitation says: \u201cdress code: clown costumes mandatory for all guests\u201d and she\u2019s firm in that, then I should either dress in a clown costume or not come to my aunt\u2019s party.  It\u2019s not up to me to think that\u2019s ridiculous, dress in a \u201cclown adjacent\u201d costume and show up anyway.  Her house, her venue, her rules.\n\nSince OP was a minor, and (presumably) did not have the right to opt out, then the blame for OP not dressing per the dress code and showing up anyway falls on the parents.  Their fault, they\u2019re the assholes.", "I kinda wish OP was wearing a dress and boxers though, just because I like fireworks and I'm sure the bride's head would explode."]}
