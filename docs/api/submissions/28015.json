He has 2 sons, I have 1. His boys are 15 & 19, mine is 14. \n\nIt\u2019s still quite hot where we live, and our house is an older farmhouse, so the heating/cooling retention SUCKS. Our kitchen/dining room/living room is an open floor plan with *high* vaulted ceilings, so it doesn\u2019t heat/cool efficiently, and our upstairs is basically unreachable in terms of climate control and remains uncomfortably warm year-round. \n\nI work part time, and so while not at work, all the big cleaning tasks like scrubbing the roughly 20\u2019 x 11\u2019 tiled kitchen floor (including the grout), deep cleaning the carpets 3-4 times a year, cleaning the kitchen cabinets, etc. are left to me. It has been **insufferable** lately, so I\u2019ve resorted to doing the housework in basketball shorts and a sports bra, which was immediately met with an uproar from my two stepsons and a sheepish request from my husband to just \u2018throw a shirt on since it makes the boys so uncomfortable\u2019. \n\nNow, mind you, I\u2019m not talking some skimpy sports bra. Think zip front, racer back, wide shoulder straps, and a fairly thick band that stops about 2 inches from my bellybutton. The average bikini top covers less! But I don\u2019t hear the end of it about how \u2018inappropriate it is\u2019, or that I\u2019m \u2018shameless and inconsiderate, and just trying to be skeevy on purpose\u2019. They say it\u2019s creepy because \u2018I\u2019m a mom; it\u2019s cringey to dress like I\u2019m in my 20s\u2019. Whenever anyone comes over, I throw on a shirt and proper pants. I\u2019m not an exhibitionist, I\u2019m just sick of *roasting*. \n\nBut here\u2019s the root of my gripe; for the last 7 years, they\u2019ve been blatantly disregarding even the most simple requests to be considerate of others in our household. \u2018Please don\u2019t wear shoes in the house, I\u2019m the only one cleaning the floors\u2019. Is that request ever honored? NOPE!\n\n\u2018Please don\u2019t eat in your rooms, the ants are out of control\u2019. Meanwhile, before I wash dishes, I have to check closets and under beds.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re gonna be out late, please be quiet coming in, I have to be up at 5 for work and your brothers get up early for school.\u2019, yet it\u2019s a weekly battle to keep the oldest from pulling in the driveway at 2 AM bumping his 20\u201d subs. \n\nEveryone else gets to live however is most convenient/comfortable for them, so why do I have to marinate in my own sweat in order to appease their awkward discomfort? Why should I have to be miserable in order to be considerate of people who can\u2019t be bothered to consider others? But I\u2019m accused of intentionally trying to make them uncomfortable so that they\u2019ll move out??
