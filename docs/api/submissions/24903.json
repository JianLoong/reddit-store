We've been cohabitating for eight months now and generally have a happy relationship.\n\nI suppose if I had to say I disliked one thing about Sam, it's that the ways she expresses her anger are incredibly juvenile. For example, if we're outside together and something ticks her off, sometimes she'll start rushing around nearly crashing into other people. Sometimes she'll do the opposite where she'll walk incredibly slowly (think Tom Tucker from that Family Guy scene), or sometimes she'll just stop dead in her tracks and refuse to move like a 3-year-old.\n\nLast Thursday, we went to the grocery store together to get something for dinner. As we were walking around Sam a pair of microwave dinners that she thought looked nice. I knew going into the conversation that she was likely to get upset, but every time I eat microwave dinners, I get an upset stomach. Since I had an in-person job interview the next day I really didn't want to deal with abdominal cramps during the process. \n\nI explained this to her and gave her some other options. For example, I suggested I could make the Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes and do a bang up job at it seeing as I'm a pretty decent cook. She said no. She wanted those microwave dinners. So I tried another way: she could get the microwave dinner. I'd get something else. Again, no. She wanted to eat the same thing as me. Finally I just walked away because I couldn't reason with her. She followed me with the two dinners in hand.\n\nInstead of going to the checkout with her I waited by the door. I had decided at this point that I just wasn't going to have dinner. Sam walked up to the door, pulled out her phone, and froze. People could not enter or leave the grocery store. As she went full press conference Mitch McConnell staring at her phone in the doorway, I just kind of watched as a short line queued behind her. Finally a rather large fellow lost his patience and squeezed past her, followed by yelling expletives at her about not blocking doors. During his 10-second tirade, Sam looked at me multiple times. I just shrugged in response.\n\nFinally Sam walked out and loudly asked why I didn't stand up for her. I responded that she brought it upon herself. As she argued at me, a few people gave us curious glances and I believe a middle-aged woman shook her head at me. What she meant by that, I do not know.\n\nSam has barely said two words to me since. I've tried talking to her but she demands an apology. Is she really deserving of one here?", "created_utc": 1692327030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u83i2/aita_for_not_stepping_in_when_a_man_yelled_at_my/", "score": 610, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, who DOES that??", "Imagine what this woman would be like with children to feed?! It's fucking horrific, actually.", "She needs to be dumped so she understands that the world won't cater to her bad attitude. And THEN when the reality hits her she can get her own damn therapy and an analysis or diagnosis if she needs one. OP does not need or deserve to be with someone who creates stress in his life because he chose not to get sick or be in pain. That's abusive.", "Gawd Meegan, stop blocking the door", "Salisbury steak is actually surprisingly hard to make from scratch and get that kind of uncanny spongy texture it has in frozen meals! If you're craving TV dinner Salisbury steak, a homemade one might not hit the spot. I absolutely do not understand why she insisted OP eat one too though.", "A hungry person who wants to eat in 5 minutes, not in an hour.", "That\u2019s what bothered me. NTA", "I had a student in my class a few weeks ago (10 year olds).  They were all eating their lunch, and one student pulled out a bag of M&Ms.  Another student said 'they need to share those'.  Me: 'why would they do that?' Them: 'because you have to share, and I want some'.  Me: 'well I want a million dollars and a crack at Hugh Jackman, but we're both going to be disappointed'.  The student was genuinely baffled that I wouldn't force the other student to hand over their M&Ms and complained to mummy.  Mummy rang to find out why I didn't force the other student to share.  It's generational entitlement.", "She's lucky no one rammed her with their shopping cart. She was certainly asking for it.", "Sure, but would you demand your partner eat the same thing?", "I sometimes crave $2 instant noodles. Will my husband eat them as well? No, he hates them. Different dinners. So easy.", "If a person is really that hungry they won't waste time throwing tantrums in a store, just say \"thanks for offering, I'd really like to eat this thing today, go grab what you need and let's go home\".", "I suspect that You are a comedy genius! And your user name confirms it.", "I built one of them in 7 days once. I figured I was a genius as it was supposed to take 2-4 years.", "No.  I'm just responding to pooky's question.", "Raw or cooked?", "Lol I cook them. The one you throw in boiling water and forget there for 5 mins.", "Some people so fancy!  Not just smashing them, adding the powder, and eating it with a spoon.", "Lol the spoon is what gives them the best taste. I really don\u2019t get how my husband doesn\u2019t love them. Oh well"]}
