{"id": 24903, "submission_id": "15u83i2", "title": "AITA for not stepping in when a man yelled at my girlfriend for blocking a door?", "selftext": "I am a 26-year-old man and I live with my 24-year-old girlfriend, Sam. We've been cohabitating for eight months now and generally have a happy relationship.\n\nI suppose if I had to say I disliked one thing about Sam, it's that the ways she expresses her anger are incredibly juvenile. For example, if we're outside together and something ticks her off, sometimes she'll start rushing around nearly crashing into other people. Sometimes she'll do the opposite where she'll walk incredibly slowly (think Tom Tucker from that Family Guy scene), or sometimes she'll just stop dead in her tracks and refuse to move like a 3-year-old.\n\nLast Thursday, we went to the grocery store together to get something for dinner. As we were walking around Sam a pair of microwave dinners that she thought looked nice. I knew going into the conversation that she was likely to get upset, but every time I eat microwave dinners, I get an upset stomach. Since I had an in-person job interview the next day I really didn't want to deal with abdominal cramps during the process. \n\nI explained this to her and gave her some other options. For example, I suggested I could make the Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes and do a bang up job at it seeing as I'm a pretty decent cook. She said no. She wanted those microwave dinners. So I tried another way: she could get the microwave dinner. I'd get something else. Again, no. She wanted to eat the same thing as me. Finally I just walked away because I couldn't reason with her. She followed me with the two dinners in hand.\n\nInstead of going to the checkout with her I waited by the door. I had decided at this point that I just wasn't going to have dinner. Sam walked up to the door, pulled out her phone, and froze. People could not enter or leave the grocery store. As she went full press conference Mitch McConnell staring at her phone in the doorway, I just kind of watched as a short line queued behind her. Finally a rather large fellow lost his patience and squeezed past her, followed by yelling expletives at her about not blocking doors. During his 10-second tirade, Sam looked at me multiple times. I just shrugged in response.\n\nFinally Sam walked out and loudly asked why I didn't stand up for her. I responded that she brought it upon herself. As she argued at me, a few people gave us curious glances and I believe a middle-aged woman shook her head at me. What she meant by that, I do not know.\n\nSam has barely said two words to me since. I've tried talking to her but she demands an apology. Is she really deserving of one here?", "created_utc": 1692327030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u83i2/aita_for_not_stepping_in_when_a_man_yelled_at_my/", "score": 1762, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is arguably true the other way around and for non-hetero partners, but less so. Regardless of how 'deserved' it was, how annoyed you are at them, etc. You could be in the middle of an argument, they could be acting like a moron, but if a man (especially a large man) starts yelling at your partner, you tell him to take a hike or otherwise indicate that you are there and ready to intercede if necessary. Not necessarily rudely, not necessarily by disagreeing with him, but a simple \"Dude, watch your language\" would have sufficed here. It was also clearly longer than 10 seconds given she looked at you multiple times. (this wouldn't necessarily apply if he just said \"bitch\" and kept walking, but yes, someone directly yelling at your partner means you should either step in or at least indicate to your partner that you are there and will protect them if necessary. shrugging does not convey that) So for standing there like a lump and effectively conveying \"you deserve what you get\" to a woman who was being verbally assaulted by a threatening man (any woman honestly, but especially your partner) and then reinforcing that after the fact, you fucked up. Presumably you wouldn't have actually continued standing there like that if he had tried to touch her/strike her, but she now doesn't actually know that and likely feels that she can no longer rely on you to protect her in dangerous situations. That may seem overblown but we, unfortunately, live in a world where some men in situations like that will genuinely attack women over stuff like this. It likely did make her feel unsafe.

Maybe she needs help, maybe she needs a kick in the ass, maybe she needs to be told that acting like a controling, tantrum throwing child isn't reasonable or attractive.
