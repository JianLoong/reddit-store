We've been cohabitating for eight months now and generally have a happy relationship.\n\nI suppose if I had to say I disliked one thing about Sam, it's that the ways she expresses her anger are incredibly juvenile. For example, if we're outside together and something ticks her off, sometimes she'll start rushing around nearly crashing into other people. Sometimes she'll do the opposite where she'll walk incredibly slowly (think Tom Tucker from that Family Guy scene), or sometimes she'll just stop dead in her tracks and refuse to move like a 3-year-old.\n\nLast Thursday, we went to the grocery store together to get something for dinner. As we were walking around Sam a pair of microwave dinners that she thought looked nice. I knew going into the conversation that she was likely to get upset, but every time I eat microwave dinners, I get an upset stomach. Since I had an in-person job interview the next day I really didn't want to deal with abdominal cramps during the process. \n\nI explained this to her and gave her some other options. For example, I suggested I could make the Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes and do a bang up job at it seeing as I'm a pretty decent cook. She said no. She wanted those microwave dinners. So I tried another way: she could get the microwave dinner. I'd get something else. Again, no. She wanted to eat the same thing as me. Finally I just walked away because I couldn't reason with her. She followed me with the two dinners in hand.\n\nInstead of going to the checkout with her I waited by the door. I had decided at this point that I just wasn't going to have dinner. Sam walked up to the door, pulled out her phone, and froze. People could not enter or leave the grocery store. As she went full press conference Mitch McConnell staring at her phone in the doorway, I just kind of watched as a short line queued behind her. Finally a rather large fellow lost his patience and squeezed past her, followed by yelling expletives at her about not blocking doors. During his 10-second tirade, Sam looked at me multiple times. I just shrugged in response.\n\nFinally Sam walked out and loudly asked why I didn't stand up for her. I responded that she brought it upon herself. As she argued at me, a few people gave us curious glances and I believe a middle-aged woman shook her head at me. What she meant by that, I do not know.\n\nSam has barely said two words to me since. I've tried talking to her but she demands an apology. Is she really deserving of one here?", "created_utc": 1692327030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u83i2/aita_for_not_stepping_in_when_a_man_yelled_at_my/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What grown woman throws a tantrum like that? You said that you would like something else to eat not just because you didn't want it, but you have a job interview the next day, and pre-made meals upset your stomach. Does she have the mind of a child? What is so hard to understand about that? Because your opinion of not wanting that, and suggesting something else is VERY valid. She could have had one thing, and you have another but she needed the same as you?  \nHas this woman never been told no in her entire life? By her parents? Teachers? Nobody?   \nThen she throws a fit by inconveniencing other people and thus making it seem like you HAVE to say yes to these microwave meals, for her to stop? That is something I'd see my friend's 2 year old child doing.  \nThis woman needs to grow up and act like an adult. Reading this actually pissed me off XD\n\nNot the asshole AT ALL", "NTA.  She does not deserve an apology and I'd really think hard about whether you want to be dealing with her juvenile tantrums for the rest of your life.", "NTA. She is absolutely awful! I cannot even fathom why she thinks she can control what you can eat.\n\nAnd that isn't even the worst thing she did. She deliberately inconvenienced dozens of innocent people (you were innocent too FYI) just because she was annoyed.

Let her ruin some other guy's life instead of yours.", "Jesus Christ, just leave her. I doubt you wanted to date a two year old", "NTA - Well she sounds like a petulant child.

She is behaving like a particularly dense 3 year old. \n\nYou should have just bought the ingredients for your own dinner and let her get what she wanted.

Tear the band aid off quickly now.  As a side note...  women that insist men defend them have to do so because they constantly finding themselves in such situations.

Im 25f and I\u2019m even appalled that she would act like that. She needs a lot of work to do and not resort to childish behaviour to get what she wants. Also refusing for u to eat what u want?? That\u2019s not ok dude! Imo a good girlfriends would want their man to get something they want to eat, and not force their man to eat what they want. U can talk about this with her and see how it goes. If she continues to do this then I would just leave. Just because it\u2019s a good relationship in general doesn\u2019t mean u have to put up the one thing u like.
