I invite you to do a little search on this thing of using femenine nouns as insults..\n\nI propose that, if you want to call someone weak, instead of calling them a \"girl,\" call them weak. Let's use the words with their actual meaning.\n\nWomen are typically portrayed as weak by mysognist, all the while those mysognist and their fragile egos wouldn't be able to put up with half of what most women have to put up daily. \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't be so keen on defending something that has been clearly stated as a symptom of the mysogny embedded in society.", "Sure. I wasn't responding to that, I was responding to your use of the word \"disciplined\". Do you think simply saying \"No, don't do that\" and not giving any consequence is \"discipline\"? I don't, but if that's how you use the term I guess we agree.", "Thanks for clearing that up. \n\nI'm a Brit so thought that 'cowgirls' was some reference to the cheerleaders or female fans.\n\nIn any event, he is nearly an adult, was in a roomful of supporters, all of whom were engaging in some post match banter and, I say again, his language was appropriate in context.\n\nIf his mum got this offended by this rather mild language, I hope she is never persuaded to attend a Manchester United v Liverpool or Arsenal v Tottenham football match.
