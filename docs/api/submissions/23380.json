I was home/online schooled for an extremely long time and it has irreversibly damaged my social capabilities. PLEASE keep bringing her to learn new things and encounter new people.", "NTA.", "INFO What was the hot topic question she asked her dad?", "NTA for your intention, but that maybe wasn\u2019t the best way to go about it \n\nYou\u2019re right. She really does need to learn some boundaries for the real world down the road. I have to add though that homeschooling may not be the reason for it. She sounds like she is on the spectrum to me (I am familiar with the signs, as I have an autistic sister and plenty of other family members who also had/have trouble with boundaries). There are plenty of homeschooled people who aren\u2019t like that (including myself). Plus, your statement about children who are homeschooled not getting a full rounded education\u2026that\u2019s simply not true. In some cases, maybe. But to generalized like that is just not right, especially if you have little experience with it (which it seems like you do). That being said, taking plausible autism into consideration, she may be homeschooled for that very reason. Even if her parents aren\u2019t aware of autism themselves, maybe they decided on homeschooling to better protect their precious daughter based on her \u201cpersonality,\u201d know that people would see her as \u201cweird\u201d and treat her badly because of it. People on the spectrum tend to be far too easily influenced, especially when they are very young like your step daughter is. She\u2019s only 10! Give her a break! Let her be a kid still! She has time to learn about those things. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to take her innocence from her just yet. And, at the end of the day, her biological parents are the ones who have the final say in what their daughter is allowed to be influenced by. And if you took her to the art club without even passing it by her father, then I\u2019d have to say YTA for that. And FYI, if she is on the spectrum, then she\u2019s not \u201cweird.\u201d She\u2019s herself. Just because she operates differently from you doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s something wrong with her. You just need to learn how her brain processes information and work with it (rather than against it) to teach her boundaries. And it\u2019s OK for it to happen slowly and gently, because that will most likely be a hard lesson for her to learn and fully grasp.", "NTA but you arn't one of the parents.  \n\nThe big question is, if you have a child with this man, will he expect the same 'home schooling' cult like raising for your child?", "Wait, what?!\n\nHow is this possible? Was he not in her life back then? None of his family or friends mentioned it or let it slip while you were dating?", "Be careful even if you think you can\u2019t have kids. I\u2019m a member of r/pregnant, and it\u2019s shocking the number of women who are told they\u2019re infertile by doctors who end up pregnant.", "YTA: It's not your call. The decision has been made by her parents. You should be supporting your husband and not trying to be right. There is a balance between participating in the child's upbringing and taking over because you think your way is better.", "YTA\n\nIf you believe the child is in danger contact social services. But if you simply disagree with how she is being raised - you need to butt out. Or bring your concerns to the father, who will then need to have a conversation with his ex and collectively make decisions for how their child will be raised. \n\n\n\nCultures where people hug or kiss as a general greeting exist. They are actually quite common! They aren\u2019t my culture and I will continue to stick with what\u2019s appropriate for me, but it\u2019s not that strange. \n\nHomeschooling does not mean that children do not learn social skills. Some children struggle to learn social skills. Even in mainstream schooling. (I don\u2019t homeschool, I was not homeschooled, I don\u2019t have a dog in that fight)\n\nThey do not have to be ok with their child attending any social activity, and they get to decide what is and is not ok. Some parents oppose slides, contact sports, gymnastics, scouts, horse riding, meat consumption, and likely a million other things that other parents think are good for their kids. \n\nAt the end of the day, if it isn\u2019t your child, you get next to zero say. This is what absolutely sucks about being a step parent. You get all the horrible stuff (cost, inconvenience, housework) but can\u2019t control how that plays out. Hopefully you also get some pluses, but that\u2019s not written into the contract. \n\nYou also need to be careful that you do not loose your husband access to his daughter. I know some courts have required that agreed to child raising principles must be maintained while the child is young. So if previously you raised the kids according to a particular culture you don\u2019t get to just go against that when you re-marry. \n\nAlso\n\nYour husband having hid his child from you is crazy. Frankly I can\u2019t imagine having any trust in him. \n\nBut if you have decided to continue the marriage despite this, you\u2019re kind of stuck being the step parent, but don\u2019t get to treat his daughter like your new toy to make over the way you want her.", "NTA but you can absolutely homeschool the right way and kids will develop completely normally socially while still reaping benefits of homeschooling.

ALL of this rings of super religious/conservative beliefs where women are 2nd/3rd/80th class citizens, or more likely, simply property of either their father or husband. \n-He didn\u2019t feel the need to tell you he had a child until you were married\n-doesn\u2019t care about his daughter and prefers she isn\u2019t around\n-doesn\u2019t want her exposed to/socializing with others and getting \u201cideas\u201d\n-now that you\u2019re married, caring for her is YOUR responsibility (but he\u2019s very quick to demand you do it exactly how HE wants)\n\nAbsolutely NTA for trying to help this girl develop socially healthy habits, but Y T A to yourself for marrying a man who clearly does not believe women are equal to men.", "Yta.  She is a weird kid but she is not your weird kid.  Your husband is her father and he does not want you to take her so you don\u2019t take her.   This is sad and she will grow up with terrible social skills and will be incredibly gullible as she has never been exposed to people that are not \u201cgood\u201d.  \n\nTalk to hubs first and try to make him see the rrror of his ways but then if he won\u2019t agree than no don\u2019t take her to art.  Personally I would not stay with a man that is this backwards with his outdated thinking.", "NTA I think she is going to have to learn social skills if she is ever going to work in society. You are trying to help with that.", "NTA, but I am concerned for your marriage.\n\nThis poor kid is lucky to have you on her side, but I am afraid that your husband will not put up with your \"interference\".\n\nI can picture Kim growing up and having the four kids in her group forming or joining a cult because they can't face the rest of the world. This may sound extreme but it is not. Some people join cults because they need someone to tell them what to do.", "In my experience homeschooling works fine when done correctly. The only problem is the only time I've seen it done correctly was by parents that were both teachers and they constantly involved their kids in social events.\n\nYou are correct, your husband and his ex are failing their child. Thank you for advocating for their future success. Even if their parents don't think socializing is necessary for a normal life. Poor socializing will haunt them for probably the rest of their life. I'm in my 30s and still struggling.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. This kid was clearly lacking in the skills she needed for life, and her father was basically taking it away from her.", "NTA- I think what you did was great to help her learn useful things. The bio parents sound like control freaks", "I don\u2019t know about this one. In the abstract, sure, it\u2019s good for home school kids to meet new people and get new experiences. \n\nOn the other hand, you described a 10 year old as \u201cweird\u201d and complained about her giving you a hug, so it sounds like you have bigger social problems than she does. \n\nI\u2019m reading between the lines a bit, but you\u2019re not selling it. My vote is YTA.", "NTA.  They have failed to teach her she can set boundaries with others about touching.  This is the kind of kid that gets taken advantage of out in the real world because they have been taught random touching without permission is acceptable.", "NTA. I know people who had done a great job with homeschooling their kids. The kids were socialized properly because they were also allowed to do things they enjoyed, like art (the one was part of a club) she also did ballet and swimming. The son enjoyed swimming and soccer etc. Their issue was they did not like the school system and thought their kids would thrive more learning at home. Your husband and his ex? They are trying to shelter her which is ultimately setting her up for failure. At 10, she cannot just be randomly touching people. I dislike being touched by strangers, kids or nots. I make exceptions for young children because they are still learning but at 10? No ways. I teach 10 year old girls and they will always ask for a hug because they are being taught boundaries.", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019m betting this marriage isn\u2019t going to last very long.\n\nThey are setting their kid up for failure by keeping her isolated and ignorant.", "Wait do the French meet new people by giving them a hug, is this a thing? Like you give a random person a hug the first time they met them???", "I never got homeschooling, the average parent can't teach their kid higher level classes, like how is dad going to teach calculus, chemistry, and physic well? Teachers are specialized for a reason", "INFO: Did you just realize your husband is like this? This sounds like some pretty standard religious abuse. Does your husband try to keep you isolated as well?", "\u2026.and what did he say?", "I mean this kindly- if he stops you helping his daughter you need to leave. This is not a good man- he\u2019s a deadbeat. Regardless of y\u2019all having kids- he is lower than dirt and you shouldn\u2019t be lowering yourself to his standards. I highly doubt he will be there for you when something major happens bc he has shown he won\u2019t show up for his family", "NTA", "This is why I caution people on it. It can be great, but it\u2019s hard to get the right balance of social interaction unless you got $$ to spend on activities", "NTA\n\nThis is a situation where if psychologists could make laws, this kid would be a victim of child abuse. \n\nIt is DRASTICALLY important for children to be exposed to as much diversity as possible at younger ages when they are most capable of learning and adapting. 4 kids her own age? God no. No where near enough exposure or social interaction.", "NTA.", "NTA but you may need to procede with caution. Like a lot of homeschooling parents, your husband is using homeschooling as a form of indoctrination. You've just learned that Kim's social isolation is not a bug, it's a feature. Huge huge huge red flag.", "NTA, I honestly think homeschooling is child abuse. Completely fails to prepare children for the real world.", "It's not uncommon to kiss the cheek.", "This is where I\u2019m stuck. If OP didn\u2019t know about the daughter until after the wedding, that means there were no signs of her at his house: no pictures, no belongings, no drawings on the fridge\u2026no trace of her. Is that how a loving parent acts? I think not.", "Infertile doesn\u2019t mean sterile. Infertile just means that they\u2019re less likely to get pregnant.", "NTA. This is how you raise \u201c unsocialized humans\u201d. Bad idea. He is messing up. I feel sorry for the child.", "Info: what are the topics?", "NTA but I question why you are in a relationship with this person.\n\nIs he weird about everything?", "Wow just saw your comment about not telling you he had a kid.\n\n\nWTAF?", "JFC", "You MUST divorce this man, this is the craziest thing Ive ever read on this sub", "No, they air kiss cheeks.  \n\nIts normal there.   No big deal.", "Absolutely this! I went to a public high school that had teachers aids from a large religious school that started at pre k and went all the way to PhD. These people had rarely left their bubble. I never saw one of these aids not leave in tears their first day of class observation. They were completely overwhelmed just seeing a variety of people/brhaviors in the classroom, they didn't even have to teach or interact with the class. It always blew my mind how rattled they were by my day to day life. Always wondered how they survived daily living like going to the grocery store with the rest of us.. must be so stressful."]}
