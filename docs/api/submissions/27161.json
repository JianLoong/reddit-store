The fact that you thought about her while you were simply buying an onion is very sweet and touching and I can't believe she didn't appreciate it.", "She wasn't mean about it, but it hit different because I thought I was doing something that would make her feel special,  apparently it was just something else she had to do.", "NTA but I am laughing so hard at all of the comments about the intense and arduous task of arranging flowers in a vase. \n\nLike, sure you could also do it. A child could do it. If the stem ends were tasty (and non toxic) my dog could do it. Why? Because it's not difficult at all, and it's kind of fun. \n\nWhat's next? You arrange them in a vase but you used the wrong one? You used the right vase but didn't use the correct water? The sun sets earlier now so they'll die faster.

If she\u2019s  gonna tell you that you made work for her, she should explain to you what would be appreciated in future gift flowers, not what the work is (unless she wants you to make arraignment, but if you\u2019re like me, she\u2019s  likely not going to like that either)", "So NTA but I will say when my husband brings me flowers, dropping what I'm doing to cut them and put them in a vase and then clean up the trash is a huge hassle. It's not the end of the world and I know he's being sweet and I love that he's thought of me, but I have definitely thought before how much nicer it would be if he would just grab a vase and trim them and put them in water himself (especially since he's usually coming home around dinner time and I'm just so busy). Grabbing flowers and paying for them is relatively easy. It's nice that you're thinking of her, but maybe go the extra mile and think of helping her, as well.", "You can't please some people.

I think they'd be lovely by themselves in a vase and, assuming you have some vases, don't think it's much work to trim them a bit if needed and plonk them in a vase, however she sees it differently. Now you know that if you see roses and want your wife to have some, that maybe you should stop at a florist or have them deliver an arrangement instead of just bringing her roses wrapped in plastic alone.", "NTA, having a gesture out of nowhere is something beautiful and shows you think about her and love her.

You\u2019re very sweet, it\u2019s sad that you\u2019re wife can\u2019t appreciate it. Literally all she had to do was fill a vase with water, that\u2019s hardly homework.

Wow, sounds like your wife takes a lot more than flowers for granted.", "NTA lol because I just bought my wife a $6 dollar grocery store bouquet on my way home today and she put them right in a vase and kissed me. It's just a nice sweet thing. It's not like potted plants you have to care for and tend to. You stick them in a cup with water, done!

Does she have any history, by chance, of working in a flower shop?\n\nIf yes, you bought her an ingredient, that she now has to make into a meal, especially if she's particular with aesthetics.

I disagree with all of these commenters and your wife that you gave her extra work.  You walked into the house and gave her a gift.  She had to do absolutely nothing with that gift.  They might wilt overnight if not put in a vase, but that's fine.  The gift was still a nice thought.   If she wanted them to live she could have asked you \"would you mind putting them in the vase that's above the refrigerator?\" and as thoughtful as you are I'm sure you would have said sure thing. They don't need baby's breath to be a pretty thoughtful gift.  If she doesn't like flowers, it would be easy in a few days to say \"dear, I love that you brought me flowers.  I just wanted to let you know that my favorite gifts are chocolates, candies, (or whatever other random thing) for the future\" with a big smile on  her face.  You'd get the idea without it being bitchy.  I think she is the asshole.\n\nNow, I think YTA for putting an onion in a plastic bag.  It's a root vegetable that comes with it's own packaging.

If you bring flowers home as a gift,  you should also trim the stems to the right height and arrange them in a vase or you are putting a burden on the gift receiver.\n\nIf you just have a couple big vases and you brought flowers that only fill it halfway then it is easy to feel unhappy about a half empty vase.

Know the vases you have, understand if you aren't bringing home a full arrangement that you can put 3-4 flowers in some small glass jars or cups and scatter them around. (I might phrase it as \"just wanted to brighten the house\" vs \"I got YOU flowers\" However if they were already IN a vase and your wife was just complaining they needed extras, she's kinda TA. If you have had similar talks before and didnt mention it, you might be TA. If you're feeling generous you can ask her what sorts of flower arrangements she sees that she likes the next couple of times you're out where they are sold so you can get a better idea what she likes.\n\nTL:DR she was kinda rude, youre NTA, but also you've been together 19 years and it seems like you could use some extra communication to understand each other's wants better by now.", "Has OPs wife stated that last minute Walmart gifts are not her love language?

This sort of reminds me of a situation with my ex-wife. Once I arranged a surprise flower delivery from a florist for her for no special reason. And this was when you couldn't do them online, so it required more coordination.\n\nWhen they asked what time to deliver it, I picked a time when I knew she'd be home, as the kids would be back from school.\n\nAfter I returned home from work that evening she had nothing to say about the flowers. After I asked her if she had received them, she told me that I picked the wrong time to have them delivered because it was important to get them delivered earlier in the day when all the other SAHMs were at home by themselves so they could see the truck come and be jealous!\n\nI couldn't fathom such thinking on her part. The flowers were for her - a token of my love, not a prop for her neighborhood spousal braggadacio.\n\nI still find that experience to be completely bizarre all these years later.", "NTA. Married 19 years and still buying her flowers? Unless she\u2019s told you that she doesn\u2019t like that, it\u2019s a wonderful and sweet thing.

I totally get the emotional/mental labor thing and how women are usually made responsible for that, which this is reminding me of and sounds related to your wife\u2019s comment, but this to me is nothing like that.

If she didn\u2019t even want to put them in a vase herself, I imagine you would have done that for her.

Flowers are always good. \n\nBeing brought some \u201cplain\u201d roses doesn\u2019t sound like a thing to get bent out of shape over.

Unfortunately those grand gestures often created more work for me or required me to spend extra money. One that springs to mind is he decided to deliver  an enormous box of flowers for me. I actually had no vases in the house big enough to hold these flowers, even if I split the arrangement. I had to go and purchase vases. Then I had to divide these flowers, trim all the stems , followed by having to find places around the house to put all these vases . His grand gesture screwed my day off .

The point of the tiktok was that men could take the gift a step further and prepare the flowers to put it in a vase vs just handing them the flowers straight from the store. \n\nExpecting the flowers ready to drop in a vase is entitled.

It could be that she just doesn\u2019t have the energy for one more thing. Like others have said, next time trim them and put them in the vase yourself. \n\nI do think it\u2019s a bit much if her issue was that it was just roses without baby\u2019s breath.
