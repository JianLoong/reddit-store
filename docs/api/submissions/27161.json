If you bring flowers home as a gift,  you should also trim the stems to the right height and arrange them in a vase or you are putting a burden on the gift receiver.\n\nIf you just have a couple big vases and you brought flowers that only fill it halfway then it is easy to feel unhappy about a half empty vase.

Know the vases you have, understand if you aren't bringing home a full arrangement that you can put 3-4 flowers in some small glass jars or cups and scatter them around. (I might phrase it as \"just wanted to brighten the house\" vs \"I got YOU flowers\" However if they were already IN a vase and your wife was just complaining they needed extras, she's kinda TA. If you have had similar talks before and didnt mention it, you might be TA. If you're feeling generous you can ask her what sorts of flower arrangements she sees that she likes the next couple of times you're out where they are sold so you can get a better idea what she likes.\n\nTL:DR she was kinda rude, youre NTA, but also you've been together 19 years and it seems like you could use some extra communication to understand each other's wants better by now.", "Has OPs wife stated that last minute Walmart gifts are not her love language?

After I asked her if she had received them, she told me that I picked the wrong time to have them delivered because it was important to get them delivered earlier in the day when all the other SAHMs were at home by themselves so they could see the truck come and be jealous!\n\nI couldn't fathom such thinking on her part. The flowers were for her - a token of my love, not a prop for her neighborhood spousal braggadacio.\n\nI still find that experience to be completely bizarre all these years later.", "NTA.

I actually had no vases in the house big enough to hold these flowers, even if I split the arrangement. I had to go and purchase vases. Then I had to divide these flowers, trim all the stems , followed by having to find places around the house to put all these vases . His grand gesture screwed my day off .

A group of a dozen or more firefighters went to dinner in a restaurant, and the OP of that post offered to pay for their group's meals, as a way of thanking them for their service.  The OP posted a photo of the receipt.  They paid over $500.\n\nPeople in the comments dragged OP for being a selfish asshole for not paying a tip.  They said that it literally would have been better if they had not offered to pay for the meals.\n\nOther comments tried to point out that the firefighters were perfectly capable of tipping for their own meals, but the naysayers wouldn't have any of it.  Either pay it all, including a minimum 20% rip, or you're the worst, most selfish asshole on the planet.", "It could also be that she is stressed, having a bad day, or is simply mad at OP for some reason that he is unaware of (and for which she did not tell him about yet).\n\nMy wife whom I have been married to for 16 years and been with for 21 years got mad at me 2 weeks ago for a full day over something I said to her in her dream.  She simply woke up mad at me and didn't tell me about it until the next day.", "Watching guys buy red roses on valentine's day is almost like watching inmates do court mandated community service.   I couldn't even talk a lot of these guys into at least another color when the roses of other colors were larger and prettier because they hadn't been so hurried and unscrupulously picked.\n\nAnd yes, if OPs wife is a flower enthusiast and said \"please, this isn't my style\" and he buys his court mandated flowers anyway he deserves some ire.", "Agreed. Bitching about a gift of flowers because they don\u2019t have baby\u2019s breath is not a middle class thing to do. It\u2019s an ah thing to do.", "I come from a long line of florists. I'm talking I was the third generation to work in a shop that had been owned by my great grandmother.\n\nWe hate baby's breath. We only used it because people wanted it. It smells like shit and it looks like shit.", "Thank you for saying this.\n\nI can't believe they've been married and he doesn't know this isn't something she'd appreciate. \n\nI don't think the guy is an AH, but also... she didn't like the gift. Important info for next time. Move on, man. She didn't do anything wrong.\n\nWhen I was a single mom, my 9-year-old and I lived in an RV for a couple of years. One Christmas, one of my ex's family members got my kid a bean bag chair. WHERE, IN AN RV, WAS I SUPPOSED TO PUT THAT? And when I asked this question aloud to some friends (not the family, whom I didn't see), they griped at me for being \"ungrateful.\" But a \"thoughtful\" gift entails thinking about the receiver and how they will accept the gift. It's more than just \"I thought of you for a moment and acted impulsively!\"", "Why dis shit not already in my belly!?", "Great.  Now I have to wash the dishes too.  Completely unacceptable.", "I find setting up cut flowers takes me a bit more time than I expect but when I have that chore, it\u2019s because I bought them for myself.\n\nThat said, if she didn\u2019t care for then, she could have skipped the cutting and arranging and let them die quickly.\n\nI think there\u2019s more going on here where there\u2019s a pattern to behaviors between OP and spouse which is not understandable from a 5 minute post about gifting flowers. Neither of them are actually talking about flowers.", "You aren't chewing and regurgitating it for them like birds do? \\*GASP\\*", "Is it just me or does baby\u2019s breath stink like a baby\u2019s butt? I hate baby\u2019s breath and throw it out if included in a bouquet.", "You don\u2019t need to buy a new vase every time. Husbands can also just *get out one of the vases in your shared home* and cut the flowers and put them in the vase and clean up. They are also able to do that. That\u2019s the point. If you buy someone a gift you don\u2019t ask them to wrap it for you\u2026 so if you\u2019re giving flowers as a gift *to a person you live with*, do the whole thing, don\u2019t give them the flowers with an accompanying task."]}
