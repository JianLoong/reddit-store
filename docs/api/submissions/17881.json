It might be worth pointing out that she already used her +1 on her partner, and that by asking for another, it could set a precedent for others to ask which could snowball in to a massive expense.", "\u201cI know things are different back at home, but here in the US, it isn\u2019t customary to even ask what you\u2019re asking. I tried to make sure those who are single had a plus one & you have yours-your boyfriend. I really hope you can respect our decisions with regard to our wedding as I would surely do for you.\u201d \n\nNTA", "NTA, and her BF is coming?  I say let her pick between her BF and her brother.  Even if he already got an invite, the BF is basically her +1.  She's welcome to swap him out for someone else.\n\nIt's your wedding, invite who you want to share the celebration with.  Be prepared though for your bridesmaid/friend to either pout or cancel altogether.", "NTA, not even a teensy bit. The etiquette over who gets invited to a wedding varies a lot from one place to the next, but it is ultimately about who the couple want present. It\u2019s not a regular party where extra people add to the atmosphere, it\u2019s a private event. Whatever that means to the couple.", "NTA\n\nBridesmaids generally get a plus one. You mention her boyfriend is attending that would be counted as her plus one. If she wants to leave her boyfriend at home and take her brother instead, that's fine but it doesn't change the fact that she gets one guest and she needs to pick which one is more important to her. It seems weird that she is pushing for her brother to attend when there is no close relation to him. It's your wedding, stand your ground.", "NTA and I hate wedding drama about invites. You can invite whoever you want and not inviting someone you've met twice is super fair.\n\nIf your friend is insistent ask her to pay for his headcount.", "NTA.\n\nPlus Ones are fair. Sometimes you won't know the Plus One they're bringing along, but that's OK. As long as every guest is treated equally (e.g. you don't ban the Plus One because they're not married or they're in a same-sex relationship or whatever), then it's all good.\n\nPlus More Than One? Unless you are insanely rich, that's just ridiculous.\n\n\"It's only one more person\" doesn't hold up as an excuse. If you give a Plus Two to your bridesmaid, you'd have to offer a Plus Two to everyone. There goes your budget. If guests who brought a Plus One found out that your bridesmaid got a Plus Two, some of them might wonder why a Plus Two wasn't extended to them as well.\n\nStand your ground. Her request is not reasonable, you are not being harsh, and you are NTA.", "NTA. It's your wedding. Nuff said", "It's your wedding......full stop.\n\nRemember NO is a complete sentence.", "Nta it's your wedding. Is the brother new the area? Or or are they all flying in? If the first I suppose she could be thinking it be a good way to meet some people which is still not your concern. Maybe just why she's being so adamant?", "NTA.\n\nYou tell her what you told us. You're limited to numbers, there are people you've had to leave off the list, she's already got her plus one and so no.", "NTA.", "NTA. It's your wedding, and you've already given her a plus-one by inviting her boyfriend, which is what plus-ones are generally supposed to be used for.", "NTA, if her boyfriend will be there that is her plus one.", "NTA - and it's not your responsibility to make her understand when she clearly doesn't want to understand. You've said 'no'. This is not wedding planning by committee. She's received her answer and needs to accept it.", "NTA\n\nThe bridesmaid got her plus one. That's it. The whole family doesn't get to come just because she's in the wedding.\n\nUp to you who you invite, but if the brother is hard work, remember that sister is supposed to be in the wedding party, the pictures, the reception line. Is her plus one going to be his keeper?", "she gets a +1, not a +2. stand firm on this, OP. NTA.", "Do you know all of the other 199 guest?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
