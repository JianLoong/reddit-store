You didn\u2019t fit a lock when there was no problem - but now there has been a problem and it\u2019s made you more conscious of the security of your home, you\u2019re not the asshole for reacting to that.", "NTA.

They could have knocked on your door and said they needed to have a rummage around in search of whatever. They chose not to.", "NTA, as they were clearly poking their noses where they didn't belong.

I do not know what a \u2018close\u2019 is but if your and their homes were each halves of a single building they STILL had zero legal right to be snooping in your stuff. Get a lock and paint that sucker bright orange or neon pink so it draws their eyes every time they are outside!", "NTA but a more neighborly way to handle it would have been to just walk out and ask them if they needed something and tell them next time to talk to you first before going into your storage room.", "Sure you haven't had a problem in the years you've lived there, but you have one now!

You have every right to keep nosy people off your property and to lock up your possessions. Hell I locked my dog run the first day I bought my house.\n\nIf you don't tell them off they may feel like they can just come and do it again.

My guess is that they were looking for something belonging to the former tenant. Should they have asked you first? Absolutely. Could you have opened the door and said. \u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d instead of being so hostile? Probably. Your neighbor is in the wrong, but you still need to live next to them AND with shared property.", "NTA for putting a lock on the door. However, YMBTA by how you handled the situation. I think if you'd approached it a little better it would've been best for you in the long run. You are in the right, because you are renting that property -- but it's better to try to solve these things with calmer words than \"get the hell out\", especially with someone you've known since you were a child because you were best friends with their daughter. \n\nIf you rent from them directly then this was DEFINITELY a mistake, because renting is crazy right now. If you don't rent directly from them, you can assume they definitely know your landlord and might complain, which is also not ideal for lease renovations. \n\nNot all is lost, though. You can go over with a pie or a small gift and apologize for the way you reacted. You have a right to setting your boundary, but ideally you set it with kindness (the first time).", "Nta for putting a lock.\n\n\nVery soft yta for how you reacted. You went from 0 to 100.\n\nShould have asked what they are doing. They should have come and ask for permission if they wete looking for something maybe the old tenant left?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They are lucky they werent met at gun point.  You don't go rummaging around other people's property.", "Nta", "WTF is a close?", "NTA.  I have locks and a Blink camera in by building.  If someone goes in there, or even looks through the windows, I know.  I despise sticky beaks.  We used to have sticky fingered neighbors, they stole from everyone around me.  When it first started I made it known if I caught them in my property, they would need physician assistance. Nothing ever came missing from our place.  The same guy, around 19, had a thing for my then 14 yr old daughter. I cornered him up and told him if he came near her I would cut it off and stick it down his throat.  Needless to say I never had any trouble with them. Anyway, stand your ground, sometimes nice, just isn\u2019t enough.", "NTA - yeah you could have been nicer in asking WTF is going on but you were under no obligation to be. Although that might cause problems/tension in y\u2019all\u2019s relationship (you & the neighbor), they essentially risked that relationship by invading your privacy in the first place. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong AT ALL and had BETTER NOT apologize!!!!", "NTA\n\nrandom thought from someone that have bad neighbors but maybe they been hiding drugs or something els in there, easy access and they can ofc clam they dont have anything to do whit it if someone find the stuff", "NTA", "No you are not the AH. That is trespassing.", "I'm not in the UK--what is a close?", "NTA. I don't think you should apologize. They could have asked you before they tried to root around YOUR cellar. They didn't even ask. If you apologize they'll put all the blame on what happened on you.", "NTA, they didn't install cameras or anything?", "NTA but also not the best approach even if they were in the wrong. Now you're probably on not speaking terms with your, if not actually hostile. \n\nIt's a shame that you need to be the one to put out an olive branch and try and get an explanation / apology to normalize relationships again although I doubt you'll ever forget \"the shed incident\". \n\n Hopefully there's a simple reason and a very clueless neighbor who \"just assumed\" you wouldn't mind, or maybe they were both drunk and being dumb because of that. A simple reminder of the golden rule might help them see the error of their ways...\n\nOr maybe you'll be very lucky and they figure it out on their own and apologize first.", "ESH. They should not have gone into your cellar without permission. It seems beyond all reason that you wouldn't lead by simply asking what they're doing. You know all of these people well. I think both sides should apologize & then figure out what was going on.  And putting a lock on it would not be a bad idea.", "Visit any city in Scotland. They are everywhere.", "Legally speaking, no. They broke nothing to enter. I believe this would be called burgling. As in the neighbor is a burglar, similar to a ham~burglar that takes cheeseburgers, minus the cheese of course.", "No dude. You are so wrong. They have zero obligation to try and be the calm and rational one here. Their neighbor was literally in their house with no permission. And even worse, when confronted they ran away inside without giving an explanation. Maybe you like being a doormat, but that\u2019s not normal behavior to sweep under the rug.", "Uh.  Yah you do! Apparently they think they can dig through OPs things, so yes, it\u2019s time for a big old boundary.", "I don't understand why people are saying you should have been nicer. You had every right to yell at them, and to continue to yell at them when they didn't listen.", "Search that room very very thoroughly. Probably nothing, but people don't generally unlawfully enter someone's basement without a reason.", "If someone was in my property without my explicit permission, I'd have acted a lot worse than you.\nDo. Not apologise.\nApologising will only make them think what they did was OK, and they can do it again.", "the neighbors are people OP has known their whole life, and the previous three years have gone without incident, which is things could have been handled in another manner. \n\ni never said anything about being a doormat, and i can assure you i am not one in real life. setting a boundary does not have to be with anger, even though OP does have a right to be angry. \n\ni just think you can catch more flies with honey and that this particular instance should have been handled with a little more care because of their particular relationship.", "Do not apologize, you did absolutely nothing wrong", "So you\u2019re saying that you would ruin a neighborly relationship over a rake or a shovel? OP said there wasn\u2019t anything of value in there. We all agree that they shouldn\u2019t have been in there in the first place. However, they didn\u2019t come in and use her toilet without permission. It wasn\u2019t a random burglar. Sometimes it\u2019s better to find out what\u2019s going on rather than jump to conclusions.", "Scootindog is right - it could be described as a narrow alley or I\u2019ve also heard it referred to as a passageway.", "Especially when it was out of character. Never too safe", "there are ways to apologize for your part while making clear that certain actions will not be tolerated again. you need to use your adult words, but it is possible to apologize and set a boundary in one same conversation, especially since the previous three years as neighbors have gone without incident and these are the parents of OP's childhood best friend.", "OP deserves an apology quick if the neighbor has any social cues.", "You better not apologize! You did absolutely nothing wrong. If I were you, I would go knock on your neighbors door and ask what they are doing. It\u2019s especially important to do it immediately while the old tenant is there. Don\u2019t let them just run away and lock themselves inside from you to ignore your perfectly reasonable questions!", "If someone enters your property without your explicit permission, it is reasonable for them to assume that if they're caught the owner / tenant will be pretty cross.\nYou are not entitled to someone being polite to you, when you are crossing this boundary, regardless of your relation to them.", "I agree. An explanation would also be appropriate. It\u2019s not the end of the world though.", "i never said anyone was entitled to OP's kindness. of course they're not. \n\ni'm just trying to convey that OP is not the only person that lives in their home (referring to their partner, not the neighbors) and that this situation could have been handled with more care. \n\nsometimes, even if you aren't the one in the wrong, you need to put an effort towards communicating without anger with people who are on another side of an uncomfortable situation. this is a part of life.", "Agreed. Definitely not the end of the world. OP definitely should feel zero guilt here.", "I agree.\n\nBut I don't feel OP overreacted to the situation. There is still room for civility, and for them to speak with their neighbours about what happened. That doesn't have include an apology."]}
