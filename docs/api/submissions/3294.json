{"id": 3294, "submission_id": "z5di3o", "title": "AITA for putting a lock on my outdoor storage room and telling my neighbours to mind their business?", "selftext": "Some context- we live in a house that has a shared close with our neighbours, so when you walk out of the back door your in the shared close and then out to the back gardens. In this close there is a cellar type storage on each side, one ours and one being the neighbours. When I moved in there was no lock on ours, only a screw that twists round to hold the door closed, the neighbours is locked. To be really honest we get along great and Iv known my neighbours since I was a child (I was best friends with their daughter) so we just haven\u2019t got round to fixing it yet. The door to get into the close from the street is ALWAYS locked as well, so there was never any reason for me to think someone would go in there. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing overly important in there, some summer furniture, kids bikes and paddling pool. But tonight I heard some banging in the close and looked out of the peep hole to see what it was. This is when I seen my neighbour and the previous tenant of the house we live in (we\u2019ve lived here for 3 years, also know the old tenants) together looking in my cellar, I know there\u2019s nothing important in there but I felt this was completely wrong, that is still my belongings and part of my home. So I opened the door and told them to get the hell out, they had no right to be rummaging in my things and they needed to mind their own business and stop being nosy enough to go in there. \n\nI\u2019ll be putting a new lock in as soon as possible, but my fianc\u00e9 thinks I should have left it and not said anything to them. We haven\u2019t had any problems in the 3 years we\u2019ve lived here and he thinks I may have caused one now by confronting them. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA- I appreciate everyone\u2019s reply\u2019s, I acted without thinking (so I\u2019m a bit of an ah for that)  and I will be apologising for that in the morning. I\u2019ll get a lock on to save any further problems.\n\nI also have no idea why they were in there, they didn\u2019t tell me and I think if the previous tenant left anything there 3 years ago (he didn\u2019t it was empty when we moved in) he would have asked me as we did go to school together so we\u2019re not strangers.\n\n\nETA2- for those that don\u2019t know what a close is, the only way I can think to describe it is, from looking on the outside our houses are normal side by side houses(mid terrace), with an extra door between both of our main doors, this leads into the \u2018close\u2019 which is a bit like an outdoor hallway between houses that we use to move out trash bins to the front of the house on collection day. \n\nAlso, spoken to neighbours husband, neighbour and previous tenant are both drunk as heck and have no actual reason for looking in there. He apologised on their behalf as neither of them are in the house anymore they have gone to the pub. I apologised if I came across as rude but have made it known that this is unacceptable and I\u2019ll be installing a lock in the morning so it won\u2019t happen again.", "created_utc": 1669485272, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5di3o/aita_for_putting_a_lock_on_my_outdoor_storage/", "score": 844, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn\u2019t fit a lock when there was no problem - but now there has been a problem and it\u2019s made you more conscious of the security of your home, you\u2019re not the asshole for reacting to that.", "NTA.

I think if you'd approached it a little better it would've been best for you in the long run. You are in the right, because you are renting that property -- but it's better to try to solve these things with calmer words than \"get the hell out\", especially with someone you've known since you were a child because you were best friends with their daughter. \n\nIf you rent from them directly then this was DEFINITELY a mistake, because renting is crazy right now. If you don't rent directly from them, you can assume they definitely know your landlord and might complain, which is also not ideal for lease renovations. \n\nNot all is lost, though. You can go over with a pie or a small gift and apologize for the way you reacted. You have a right to setting your boundary, but ideally you set it with kindness (the first time).", "Nta for putting a lock.\n\n\nVery soft yta for how you reacted.

Needless to say I never had any trouble with them.

A simple reminder of the golden rule might help them see the error of their ways...\n\nOr maybe you'll be very lucky and they figure it out on their own and apologize first.", "ESH. They should not have gone into your cellar without permission. It seems beyond all reason that you wouldn't lead by simply asking what they're doing. You know all of these people well.

They have zero obligation to try and be the calm and rational one here. Their neighbor was literally in their house with no permission.

Apparently they think they can dig through OPs things, so yes, it\u2019s time for a big old boundary.", "I don't understand why people are saying you should have been nicer.

OP said there wasn\u2019t anything of value in there. We all agree that they shouldn\u2019t have been in there in the first place.

Never too safe", "there are ways to apologize for your part while making clear that certain actions will not be tolerated again. you need to use your adult words, but it is possible to apologize and set a boundary in one same conversation, especially since the previous three years as neighbors have gone without incident and these are the parents of OP's childhood best friend.", "OP deserves an apology quick if the neighbor has any social cues.", "You better not apologize! You did absolutely nothing wrong. If I were you, I would go knock on your neighbors door and ask what they are doing.

Definitely not the end of the world. OP definitely should feel zero guilt here.", "I agree.\n\nBut I don't feel OP overreacted to the situation.
