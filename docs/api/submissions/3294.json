In this close there is a cellar type storage on each side, one ours and one being the neighbours. When I moved in there was no lock on ours, only a screw that twists round to hold the door closed, the neighbours is locked. To be really honest we get along great and Iv known my neighbours since I was a child (I was best friends with their daughter) so we just haven\u2019t got round to fixing it yet. The door to get into the close from the street is ALWAYS locked as well, so there was never any reason for me to think someone would go in there. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing overly important in there, some summer furniture, kids bikes and paddling pool. But tonight I heard some banging in the close and looked out of the peep hole to see what it was. This is when I seen my neighbour and the previous tenant of the house we live in (we\u2019ve lived here for 3 years, also know the old tenants) together looking in my cellar, I know there\u2019s nothing important in there but I felt this was completely wrong, that is still my belongings and part of my home. So I opened the door and told them to get the hell out, they had no right to be rummaging in my things and they needed to mind their own business and stop being nosy enough to go in there. \n\nI\u2019ll be putting a new lock in as soon as possible, but my fianc\u00e9 thinks I should have left it and not said anything to them.

They should have at minimum talked to you before rummaging through your stuff. Get that lock ASAP", "NTA. Get a lock. Maybe they were not looking for stealing (i.e. taking stuff out) but putting stuff in. Storing something in your locker that could be illegal (?). Anyway, it's your lockup and none of their business. Get a lock.", "NTA. I love my neighbors. Doesn\u2019t mean they get to come into any part of my house (even my outdoor shed) without asking first. That\u2019s very odd.", "NTA, and your partner needs to grow a spine. Def get a lock, though.", "NTA, they had absolutely no right to be going through your shed. Go get that lock today and put it on.", "NTA. Wtf were they doing going through your stuff??", "INFO: What is a \"close\"?", "NTA - they were snooping and should mind their business. Your reaction is reasonable.", "Definitely NTA. They should not be going through your stuff unless you gave them explicit permission to do so. Which I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t so therefore you\u2019re NTA they are though.", "NTA - it\u2019s the bare minimum of courtesy to ask someone if you want to go poking about in their property - but they didn\u2019t, and you only found out they were there by accident because they were noisy about it. You didn\u2019t fit a lock when there was no problem - but now there has been a problem and it\u2019s made you more conscious of the security of your home, you\u2019re not the asshole for reacting to that.", "NTA. They are traspasers. You was softer that me, if I find someone in, I was callbthe police inmediatly.", "NTA. They could have knocked on your door and said they needed to have a rummage around in search of whatever. They chose not to.", "NTA, as they were clearly poking their noses where they didn't belong. It would probably have been smarter just to put a padlock on it and not say anything. But I would also have been angry, if someone was going through any of my stuff.", "NTA they were looking through your stuff, who know if they took anything. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to know when to pick his battles this is a battle worth picking.", "NTA.  What the fuck are they doing going through your cellar?  Definitely put a lock on there.", "NTA. If they get away with it once, they\u2019ll keep coming like stray cats. Always set boundaries the first time.", "NTA. OP, you were WAY nicer in what you said to them than I would have been. I do not know what a \u2018close\u2019 is but if your and their homes were each halves of a single building they STILL had zero legal right to be snooping in your stuff. Get a lock and paint that sucker bright orange or neon pink so it draws their eyes every time they are outside!", "NTA but a more neighborly way to handle it would have been to just walk out and ask them if they needed something and tell them next time to talk to you first before going into your storage room.", "Sure you haven't had a problem in the years you've lived there, but you have one now! NTA put a lock on it!", "NTA, but if you *want* to have a decent relationship with them moving forward (for your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sake?) you could apologize for the yelling and ask them what they were doing.

They have also showed they need a lock on their side. If they say anything just let them know you\u2019re following their example. Their example to lock up their belongings though, not to dig through their property because that would be wrong.", "NTA. They had no right to even open your shed. You have every right to keep nosy people off your property and to lock up your possessions. Hell I locked my dog run the first day I bought my house.\n\nIf you don't tell them off they may feel like they can just come and do it again. Id have done the same thing in your position.", "NTA, they were breaking and entering.", "NTA - But since you knew them \"Hey, what's going on here\" was an alternative to GTFO.", "NTA You need a lock right away and then you need to talk to your fiance about their lack of boundaries.", "NTA why wouldn\u2019t you inspect when someone is rummaging through your things?", "NTA, but you could have handled the situation more politely. My guess is that they were looking for something belonging to the former tenant. Should they have asked you first? Absolutely. Could you have opened the door and said. \u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d instead of being so hostile? Probably. Your neighbor is in the wrong, but you still need to live next to them AND with shared property.", "NTA for putting a lock on the door. However, YMBTA by how you handled the situation. I think if you'd approached it a little better it would've been best for you in the long run. You are in the right, because you are renting that property -- but it's better to try to solve these things with calmer words than \"get the hell out\", especially with someone you've known since you were a child because you were best friends with their daughter. \n\nIf you rent from them directly then this was DEFINITELY a mistake, because renting is crazy right now. If you don't rent directly from them, you can assume they definitely know your landlord and might complain, which is also not ideal for lease renovations. \n\nNot all is lost, though. You can go over with a pie or a small gift and apologize for the way you reacted. You have a right to setting your boundary, but ideally you set it with kindness (the first time).", "Nta for putting a lock.\n\n\nVery soft yta for how you reacted. You went from 0 to 100.\n\nShould have asked what they are doing. They should have come and ask for permission if they wete looking for something maybe the old tenant left?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
