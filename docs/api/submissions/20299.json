{"id": 20299, "submission_id": "14ftjqo", "title": "AITA for lying to my mom about my wedding date because I didn't want to invite her or my family?", "selftext": "My husband and I got married two weeks ago. We had a small ceremony in the woods with just our closest friends, my brother, and my husband's two siblings. In total, there were twelve people. It was wonderful. However, I lied to my mom about when I was supposed to have the wedding and she found out and is now mad at me.\n\nWhen I first got engaged, I announced it to everyone and planned on having my mom and family at the wedding. But as I started to plan, I realized two things: I'm not close to most of my family and my mom is a controlling alcoholic. In fact, I don't care for any of my siblings except the brother I invited. The rest of my family I either have no contact with or are \"unrefined\" and do not make for pleasant company. I saw no reason to invite them.\n\nBut my mom kept pressuring me not only to invite them but to have my wedding at her church. I didn't want to as I am not a Christian, and despite my mom being one, she is a heavy drinker. She wanted alcohol at the reception, but neither my husband nor I did, as we are teetotalers. She gave up on that, but implied she would drink before the wedding and stayed firm on me having it at the church. She didn't like the way I planned on wearing my hair or my dress either and tried to make me pick the dress and hairstyle she wanted as she \"knew best.\"\n\nI felt I was losing control of the situation, but I was also scared of upsetting her, so I lied and said I had postponed the wedding and I'd let her know when the new date was. I said it would probably be another year or two, and we'll decide on the revenue, dress, guests, etc then. After I talked to my husband about this, we decided on the woods ceremony and he opted not to invite his parents or family as he thought it would be fair.\n\nShe found out through my sister as she lurked on my husband's friend's instagram page where he had uploaded pictures of the wedding. My mom is now angry and sad and has accused me of not loving her and saying she never thought I'd do her wrong or turn my back on her like other people. She has called and texted me many times over this, and I've been ignoring her. Other family members have reached out to me about it as well, and my sister seems to be taking pleasure in all of this.\n\nPart of me feels bad, but I also feel I did the right thing as I think the wedding would've been a disaster if I went along with my mom's ideas.", "created_utc": 1687408877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ftjqo/aita_for_lying_to_my_mom_about_my_wedding_date/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your family, especially your sister,  seems to be. Good on you for being NC with most of them. Your mother needs some introspection into why you did what you did. Maybe just tell her directly. If she accepts it, good. If not, you know where you stand with her too.", "NTA. You knew she\u2019d find out eventually. Now she\u2019s found out. Let her stew. Perhaps she will learn a lesson about trying to control you.", "NTA. Weddings have been turned into massive ego driven spectacles. Having a small wedding with people you truly love is great. Your mom will eventually get over it.", "NTA. Really you were going to postpone and then decided on the woods. You were trying to protect yourself from your alcoholic mother and her bad behavior", "NTA. Sad to see she\u2019s acting as if it were her wedding \ud83e\udd23 There\u2019s no wrong in what u did, if I were in ur shoes I\u2019d do something in similar terms as well", "NTA - her behavior prior to and after she found out simply shows what sort of person she is.  \n\nINFO: I and I'm sure everyone else would like to know how your husbands family have responded to the 'secret' wedding?\n\nIf they're disappointed but understanding and happy for the two of you then that just goes to show that you are definitely NTA", "NTA but you would\u2019ve had a better long term outcome if you\u2019d told the truth and enforced your boundaries", "Nta your wedding your rules you can ivitw who ever you wnat and do what ever you want within reason", "NTA. Your wedding, your invite list. I didn't even have to read the story lol", "NTA. Some parents are terrible and should be misled.", "C'mon on....it was bound to get out", "NTA and time to cut them all off. They aren\u2019t going to get any better until they get help and they have to be willing for that to happen", "YTA. You should have been an adult about it instead of hiding it. I see no relationship with your mother in the future. She will block you.", "Mild YTA\n\nI personally find the description of the family being unrefined to sound classist. As that is something I've heard, the richer in society use to refer to those who are poorer.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with not inviting your mother or only those you want, but be upfront about it instead of hiding it.", "NTA. You've essentially said that you don't have anything to do with most of these people and don't want much to do with the others inc. your mom...so why do you care now? I'm asking genuinely. \n\nSeems like you're just accepting stress from people you don't even want or need in your life. So why have them there? You have a choice and it doesn't seem like your brother, the singular one you do get along with, cares either.", "Would say ESH \n\nNot inviting people you don't want to to your wedding sounds pretty normal and most people would have respected that.\n\n But lying to postpone consequences will get you some backlash and you can lose trust from people who'll hear about this story.", "YTA. What did you expect? You lied to your mother, and she found out you didn\u2019t want her to come to your wedding and wouldn\u2019t even term her that. \n\nYou can\u2019t not invite your mother to your wedding and expect everything to be happy families after. \n\nThe issue isn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t want your mother at your wedding - it was your expectation that doing this & lying was an ok thing.", "ESH.  Be an adult just explain to her that she\u2019s not invited for the reasons you described above. And then your husband is kind of weird for not inviting his own parents. And you guys had to have it out in the woods like you\u2019re eloping or something. Whatever. I don\u2019t have high hopes for you guys though.", "YTA.", "I kinda wanna say soft YTA just because you lied to take the cowards way out of difficult conversation. I mean I get it, and I cant say for certainty I wouldnt have done what you did too, but imo lying just makes it worse and sorta punished his parents for your mom's mistakes. But i wanna say i understand you were caught between a rock and a hard place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes she\u2019ll be angry and upset but it can be a step forward into this new marriage for you to just be honest. Let her know that this is your life and you felt like she was taking control. And whatever else there might be to discuss. If you need to cut down on contact for yourself and your marriage then do so. Maybe that will make her willing to change", "You had the drama-free wedding you deserve, NTA.\n\nMy daughter married her husband in his home state in USA (we're in the UK) with two friends as witnesses and no family present - not because of any bad feeling at all, but because they were about to settle over here and it was neat and tidy to do it quickly.  I said it was fine to have his family there, it wouldn't hurt my feelings at all, but they insisted on parity and had an incredibly personal ceremony performed by the captain on a small boat in New Orleans, out in the bayou. We all cried our eyes out at the video and everyone was happy about everything. \n\nWeddings, like births, can be great or awful and spoiled by other people - but it's what comes after that matters - the marriage, and the life.  I wish you long and happy ones, OP. You made the right decision."]}
