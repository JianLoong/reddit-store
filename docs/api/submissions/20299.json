We had a small ceremony in the woods with just our closest friends, my brother, and my husband's two siblings. In total, there were twelve people. It was wonderful. However, I lied to my mom about when I was supposed to have the wedding and she found out and is now mad at me.\n\nWhen I first got engaged, I announced it to everyone and planned on having my mom and family at the wedding. But as I started to plan, I realized two things: I'm not close to most of my family and my mom is a controlling alcoholic. In fact, I don't care for any of my siblings except the brother I invited. The rest of my family I either have no contact with or are \"unrefined\" and do not make for pleasant company. I saw no reason to invite them.\n\nBut my mom kept pressuring me not only to invite them but to have my wedding at her church. I didn't want to as I am not a Christian, and despite my mom being one, she is a heavy drinker. She wanted alcohol at the reception, but neither my husband nor I did, as we are teetotalers. She gave up on that, but implied she would drink before the wedding and stayed firm on me having it at the church. She didn't like the way I planned on wearing my hair or my dress either and tried to make me pick the dress and hairstyle she wanted as she \"knew best.\"\n\nI felt I was losing control of the situation, but I was also scared of upsetting her, so I lied and said I had postponed the wedding and I'd let her know when the new date was. I said it would probably be another year or two, and we'll decide on the revenue, dress, guests, etc then. After I talked to my husband about this, we decided on the woods ceremony and he opted not to invite his parents or family as he thought it would be fair.\n\nShe found out through my sister as she lurked on my husband's friend's instagram page where he had uploaded pictures of the wedding. My mom is now angry and sad and has accused me of not loving her and saying she never thought I'd do her wrong or turn my back on her like other people. She has called and texted me many times over this, and I've been ignoring her. Other family members have reached out to me about it as well, and my sister seems to be taking pleasure in all of this.\n\nPart of me feels bad, but I also feel I did the right thing as I think the wedding would've been a disaster if I went along with my mom's ideas.", "created_utc": 1687408877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ftjqo/aita_for_lying_to_my_mom_about_my_wedding_date/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she accepts it, good. If not, you know where you stand with her too.", "NTA. You knew she\u2019d find out eventually. Now she\u2019s found out. Let her stew. Perhaps she will learn a lesson about trying to control you.", "NTA. Weddings have been turned into massive ego driven spectacles. Having a small wedding with people you truly love is great. Your mom will eventually get over it.", "NTA. Really you were going to postpone and then decided on the woods. You were trying to protect yourself from your alcoholic mother and her bad behavior", "NTA. Sad to see she\u2019s acting as if it were her wedding \ud83e\udd23 There\u2019s no wrong in what u did, if I were in ur shoes I\u2019d do something in similar terms as well", "NTA - her behavior prior to and after she found out simply shows what sort of person she is.  \n\nINFO: I and I'm sure everyone else would like to know how your husbands family have responded to the 'secret' wedding?\n\nIf they're disappointed but understanding and happy for the two of you then that just goes to show that you are definitely NTA", "NTA but you would\u2019ve had a better long term outcome if you\u2019d told the truth and enforced your boundaries", "Nta your wedding your rules you can ivitw who ever you wnat and do what ever you want within reason", "NTA. Your wedding, your invite list. I didn't even have to read the story lol", "NTA. Some parents are terrible and should be misled.", "C'mon on....it was bound to get out", "NTA and time to cut them all off. They aren\u2019t going to get any better until they get help and they have to be willing for that to happen", "YTA. You should have been an adult about it instead of hiding it. I see no relationship with your mother in the future. She will block you.", "Mild YTA\n\nI personally find the description of the family being unrefined to sound classist. As that is something I've heard, the richer in society use to refer to those who are poorer.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with not inviting your mother or only those you want, but be upfront about it instead of hiding it.", "NTA. You've essentially said that you don't have anything to do with most of these people and don't want much to do with the others inc. your mom...so why do you care now? I'm asking genuinely. \n\nSeems like you're just accepting stress from people you don't even want or need in your life. So why have them there? You have a choice and it doesn't seem like your brother, the singular one you do get along with, cares either.", "Would say ESH \n\nNot inviting people you don't want to to your wedding sounds pretty normal and most people would have respected that.\n\n But lying to postpone consequences will get you some backlash and you can lose trust from people who'll hear about this story.", "YTA. What did you expect? You lied to your mother, and she found out you didn\u2019t want her to come to your wedding and wouldn\u2019t even term her that. \n\nYou can\u2019t not invite your mother to your wedding and expect everything to be happy families after. \n\nThe issue isn\u2019t that you didn\u2019t want your mother at your wedding - it was your expectation that doing this & lying was an ok thing.", "ESH.  Be an adult just explain to her that she\u2019s not invited for the reasons you described above. And then your husband is kind of weird for not inviting his own parents. And you guys had to have it out in the woods like you\u2019re eloping or something. Whatever. I don\u2019t have high hopes for you guys though.", "YTA.", "I kinda wanna say soft YTA just because you lied to take the cowards way out of difficult conversation. I mean I get it, and I cant say for certainty I wouldnt have done what you did too, but imo lying just makes it worse and sorta punished his parents for your mom's mistakes.

Yes she\u2019ll be angry and upset but it can be a step forward into this new marriage for you to just be honest. Let her know that this is your life and you felt like she was taking control. And whatever else there might be to discuss. If you need to cut down on contact for yourself and your marriage then do so. Maybe that will make her willing to change", "You had the drama-free wedding you deserve, NTA.\n\nMy daughter married her husband in his home state in USA (we're in the UK) with two friends as witnesses and no family present - not because of any bad feeling at all, but because they were about to settle over here and it was neat and tidy to do it quickly.  I said it was fine to have his family there, it wouldn't hurt my feelings at all, but they insisted on parity and had an incredibly personal ceremony performed by the captain on a small boat in New Orleans, out in the bayou. We all cried our eyes out at the video and everyone was happy about everything. \n\nWeddings, like births, can be great or awful and spoiled by other people - but it's what comes after that matters - the marriage, and the life.  I wish you long and happy ones, OP. You made the right decision.", "You knew this was coming. Your mom was going to find out you got married. You traded a stress free wedding day for a lot of stress now. Unfortunately, your mom is a pushy person with no respect for your decisions. I am so sorry you are dealing with this.", "ESH. Your mom obviously, but you took the cowards way out. Grow a spine and learn to tell your mother no.", "YTA.\n\nif you don\u2019t want her there, you tell her. There was no way she wasn\u2019t going to find out. \n\nAnd the fact that you husband didn\u2019t invite his parents \u201cto be fair.\u201d That\u2019s the worst part of this. He doesn\u2019t get to have his parents there because you are too wimpy to tell your mother she can\u2019t come?!?!? Wow", "This is a hard one you are both an asshole and not an asshole. You are not an asshole because dealing with an acholic mother is not fun at all. Its draining and just sucks. I get this on a very deep level. However you are an asshole for saying your family is \"unrefined.\" Thats a really mean thing to say.", "NTA - but you're an adult who can tell mom \"no.\" it's a complete sentence.", "\"Mom, while I do love you, you are quickly draining me of the respect I held for you. At every turn, you belittled my choices and tried to control my wedding when your only right was to be there and support me on one of the happiest days of my life. Your alcoholism and disrespect forced an impossible crossroad of choosing between my own mental wellbeing at the expense of lying to you, or abject misery and MY wedding to the love of my life becoming YOUR family church reunion. I am sorry you were not able to be there on my special day, but it is your actions and reactions alone that led to this outcome.\"\n\nNTA.", "It was your wedding, not your mother's.\n\nYou did what you and fianc\u00e9 wanted.  \n\nIt sounds like the wedding was wonderful.  Congrats.\n\nNTA", "NTA it is interesting your mother goes to church and is a raging Alcoholic. You did what was right for you and hubby. Now, go NC with them all.", "Technically, YTA. But, there are times when it's worth it to be TA. Lying with the goal of excluding family isn't cool, even if it's deserved. You aren't looking for their approval, just their absence.", "I concur seems weird to delay the drama, though maybe fear of the wedding being crashed was present", "And her husband's parents weren't invited to \"keep it fair.\"  Nothing indicates they deserved that.", "Didn't see that in fact to avoid her controlling alcoholic mother, husband's parents became collateral damages.\n\n Unless they're also shitty parents, they were punished for nothing.\n\n \"esh\" was wrong YTA.", "ESH. Your mom clearly was hijacking your wedding planning, but the adult thing to do was to put her in her place about how your wedding is going (or not going) to be. She didn't need to be involved at all. Lying is never the answer...", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice", "NTA. It was your wedding, not hers. She needs to stay in her lane. Congrats on eloping \ud83d\ude01", "There's nothing to apologize for and don't feel guilty. Just keep ignoring everyone. NTA", "NTA - After you got married you should have just said you eloped. People do it all the time. Also, lying is hard on the soul. Having to explain afterwards is worse. Still I would have gotten married without them too.", "ESH. You didn\u2019t need to lie/hide it, you wouldn\u2019t be an AH if you\u2019d just been honest that she was no longer invited. Also uninviting your husbands parents because of your moms bad behavior feels cruel to me, unless you had actual reasons for not wanting them there either.", "NTA. And your wedding sounds absolutely perfect.", "ESH. I can see why you didn't invite your mother, but you took the coward's way out. She was gonna be hurt either way, so why not tell her the truth and be done with it? Instead of that your ILs were also uninvited. It's not the fair thing to do if they're not alcoholic religious nutjobs.\nI'd change my vote if you think your mother was capable of ruining the actual wedding had you uninvited her.", "You should have told her not to come. In fact you should probably go no contact with your mom.", "NTA. My sister didn't invite our parents to her wedding. The only people there were here, her MIL and our brother as witnesses. She was so happy and every time I look at those pictures, I think, she made the right choice. Your wedding day should be about YOU and YOUR HUSBAND, not appeasing your shitty alcoholic narc mom or lying to yourself by standing in a church. You did something meaningful for you and your husband. Something beautiful. I'm sorry she can't see that. Congratulations on your marriage, may it be filled with the joy and love you so rightly deserve!!", "Your mother wanted you to have the wedding SHE wanted.  She made it about her.  The day is about celebrating the love between 2 people so the venue of the wedding shouldn't matter.  All of the other stuff is petty.  Your mom is being very petty & selfish.  Does she know the reason she wasn't invited?  She should just keep her mouth shut & be happy for you.  Doesn't anyone know how to be happy for another person anymore? NTA", "NTA. \n\nI suspect you already know this, but I\u2019m going to repeat it anyway. Anything and everything you do that is against your mothers wishes will be deemed horrific, cruel and unconscionable. Every boundary you set will be because you \u2018don\u2019t love her\u2019. Every time you tell her no, she\u2019ll \u2018never have imagined you\u2019d hurt her like that\u2019. \n\nNone of this is true. All of it is a manipulation tactic. You did the right thing cutting her off from her wedding planning frenzy, and I would highly recommend cutting her off period.", "Op may also want to try out some Al-anon meetings", "I say esh only for the husband not inviting his family. No indication his side is problematic.", "I feel sorry for the in-laws, missing their son\u2019s wedding because of his mother in-law\u2019s bad behavior. That hardly seems \u201cfair.\u201d", "ESH; You took a path of least resistance with collateral damage with your in-laws because you are unable to stand up to your mother.  There is no wrong with having your vision on the wedding, but you lacked the decency to tell your mother you didn't care what she thought.", "NTA. You had the wedding that YOU wanted and took reasonable steps to ensure that it happened the way you planned.\n\nYea, she's mad and maybe there is something to be said about lying to her.... but she put you in that position.\n\nThe way you describe your mother it sounds like planning with her would have been one long fight and no one would enjoy the result anyway.", "NTA but I really want to put justified asshole here. This was mean. You were an asshole but she earned it. I think more people should do weddings themselves because parents and family turn them into nightmares as much as bridezillas/groomzillas. I don't agree that your husband didn't invite his parents and I'm not sure what unrefined means here. \n\nI understand why you did this. I think even if you told her you didn't want her there, she would show up anyway, drunk and screaming.\n\n>my sister seems to be taking pleasure in all of this.\n\nThere's a word for that.", "NTA. Your mother sounds manipulative and unkind. Congratulations on your wedding!", "Alcoholics don't accept boundaries when they're drinking.  As an adult child of an alcoholic parent who was a bully, I found there is no way to enforce boundaries without a boat load of stress added to what should be your special day.  This was basically a local elopement that allowed her to have the wedding of her dreams.  \n\nThe best long term outcome is to go LC with mom and accept she won't change unless she wants to.", "You have no idea how hard it is to go NC and to stand up to a narcissist. Unfortunately for most people like OP, it is not that easy. And to sit here and tell her to 'grow a spine' is the most narcissistic statement ever. I know all of this from experience, unfortunately, and it never gets easier for people like us. The OP made the right call. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, NTA. Coming from a similar background as you do/did, I would have made the same call. I'm glad you and your husband got the day you deserved, without all the pushy, narcissistic, people at your wedding. Time to cut them all off. Maria Kondo (SP?) that shit, if it does not bring you joy, throw it out.", "Maybe he just didn't want to invite the whole clan. Maybe he's only got the brothers. That's irrelevant though - the question isn't about her husband, it's about her.", "NTA. You can see echoes in the aftermath of what their involvement would have been like. Instead, you and your husband handled it very well - you made a great plan, had the type of ceremony you wanted, and had minimal drama - very well done!", "NTA, good for you to have a wedding without any bs. But i'd say you best consider that bridge burned. I don't think any parent will forgive and forget being excluded from their kid's wedding so i don't think you will be able to have any pleasant (or even normal) contact with her for a very very long time. Especially if she's not big on accountability and introspection.", "So.. you were scared that your mother would get mad, so you ensured she'd get mad by lying to her?  She'd have been mad either way, but at least this way you had a pleasant wedding with pleasant memories.", "Tell you mom if she wants you to have another wedding where everyone will be invited and drinking is allowed, she can pay for it \ud83d\ude42", "NTA - that man sounds like a keeper too. He chose your happiness over his family. That's love.", "I mean\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have lied as I\u2019m sure that was painful for her to find out, but definitely NTA for having the wedding you wanted exactly the way you wanted", "I wouldn't say she sucks here. Talking to alcoholic individuals about boundaries sucks. And it was also the husband's decision not to invite his parents, not her. So firm NTA from me."]}
