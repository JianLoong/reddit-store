All it takes is them saying something occurred that didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re fighting for your reputation. There are these services called Lyft, Uber, and taxi.

Right now especially with false allegations being a thing, you're automatically considered guilty no matter what, and a frat guy driving drunk women home doesn't look good for you if by small chance any sort of allegation comes up from one of them. Unfortunately, since there's zero consequences for women for lying about these things, there's zero reason for them not to. I know the chances are very slim, but it can still happen and ruin your life potentially.

Good choice.", "NTA.\n\nDrunk argumentative people are already difficult to deal with. You didn't know them or were obligated \n\nWhere were your \"brothers\" who brought them?", "Easy NTA", "NTA, unknown drunk girls can cause a ton of trouble.  \n\nIf the frat is getting people that drunk they need to have a service or have a way to help drunk people get ubers.\n\nmust schools provides rides for drunk girls.  I am surprised yours doesn't.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing going through my mind would have been 3 girls who know each other against me, 1 person says anything slightly bad and i am fucked.\n\nThe amount of times iv had to stop and think how a simple nice gesture like giving a lift could ruin my life as a male is scary", "NTA\n\nSounds as if you were asked on the night to give a couple of people lifts home which you did.  You then spent a further 2 hours taking COUPLES home, despite not even being one of the DDs.\n\nIf the three women had not arranged transport before/on arriving at the party or found out who was their DD it is really down to them.  Yes it meant 3 women were without transport when you refused but you did not know them, you were not a DD, and they could have made all sorts of allegations.", "You messed up when you told them to wait and then just drove off. But NTA. They should have had their own transportation lined up.\n\nImagine 3 dudes begging a girl for a ride.. they were totally in the wrong.", "NTA.", "NTA. If anything happened it would end up on you. You made a wise decision", "You were one bad decision away from being in prison for a false rape allegation. NTA, those women suck", "NTA although this reminds me why I never joined a frat lol", "This right here", "NTA", "Possibly fake. And most fraternity guys don\u2019t say \u201cfrat\u201d", "I get the feeling they lied to get out of the situation, which makes sense tbh. NTA", "To me this lie was necessary to get out of the situation that was escalating. If he just said no and walked away, they would have most likely followed him to the car and further escalated it. Sometimes in a very uncomfortable situation, it's okay to lie a little to get out of it. It would be like women making a little lie to get out of a situation with a guy they're uncomfortable around, it's just a way out of the bad scenario.", "NO fraternity guys say \"frat\".  Explained to me this way: Would you call your Country a ......?", "This is exactly what I got from this. The situation was escalating and they were getting loud and argumentative, so they would have no doubt followed him to the car and then what? To me its no different than anyone getting out of an uncomfortable situation by lying. Sometimes it's the safest way out of there.", "He made them think they had a safe ride home and then left them standing around wondering where he was and when he was coming back.  He could\u2019ve just sat on the couch and waited for them to get an Uber, talked to the president, gone in a friend\u2019s room, or even helped them get an Uber. But he chose the chicken way out.", "I agree, he could have called an uber. They also could have thought ahead and organized a ride from another friend or ordered an uber themselves too, but of course he's being blamed for their shitty planning. I agree, not the best way of getting out of it, but when 3 drunk women are starting to yell and get aggressive, it's best to get the hell out of there quick.", "NTA - How do you go drinking and not figure out a way home? So stupid of these girls.", "God,this whole this sounds terrible.", "NTA. Some Ubers will refuse people if they are drunk enough to risk vomit so why you who's not a taxi or ride share service would be expected to is beyond me.", "NTA. Why didn't the President drive them home? ...or call them a cab etc.?", "NTA.", "INFO: How did they know who you were to report you?", "NTA", "NTA- But you're first mistake was joining a \"frat\". Proof by your president being more worried about girls coming over in the future, than you're own hide.", "Lived in an apartment surrounded by greek fraternities and sororities. And it was very noisy on NYE every year. No rest from the wicked. Lol", "Not everyone at every college. I went to a crazy NYE party at a few different frats. The people who remained on campus coordinated so everyone left they knew could go have fun. There was no DDs taxis and Ubers and walking only.", "It's because they are", "Okay Captain Hindsight!", "NTAH. Drunk girls and a frat boy only spells trouble.  You can be the gentleman, drive them home, see them to the door, never step inside, make sure it is locked so no one can enter after you leave and still have major legal issues if they think you did something.", "Never help drunk women. That is a one way ticket to jail. NTA.", "NTA.  Three drunk idiots you do not know in your car.  Liability-wise, you did the right thing.\n\nfrat president needs to consider all aspects of this situation, not just the ones that bring girls to frat parties.  I would ask what is he thinking, but I think I have an idea.", "Nta you are not their designated driver and honestly three drunk girls I wouldn\u2019t wanna deal with that in general but you never know they could try to pull some false allegations on you I wouldn\u2019t want to test it", "NTA, \n\nIf anything happened it\u2019s their word against yours, it\u2019s better to draw this line early on then risk your education and future career on doing a favour that gets taken for granted. If your frat pushes then put a stop to the lifts entirely as it\u2019s not worth it in the long run.", "Because women just accuse men of things willy nilly?????", "It means they specifically CAN be a threat. Being falsely accused of sexual assault is one of my worst nightmares.", "He lied because he doesnt want to deal with angry drunks yelling at him", "Because never in the history of earth, has anyone been accused of something they didn\u2019t do. Better to not put yourself in a bad spot with zero sober witnesses.", "You're right, they just chant \"frat frat frat frat\"", "Not just that but I also mean a physical threat, people often assume women can\u2019t be killers or rapists but they most definitely can.

Or it being the norm where they are for whatever reason. Not everything immediately outside stereotypical expectations is fake."]}
