Tried ruining his career and life for what?", "Drunk people accuse anyone in proximity of them of things willy nilly, especially if the people near them are strangers.\n\nI was usually the designated drunk person babysitter at parties because I don't like being more than tipsy, and it's crazy the difference between how a blackout drunk will treat a stranger trying to help them versus a friend trying to help them. I also ran into some party regulars who were entirely different people when they were sober vs drunk. It would have been devastating if the very professional and conservative 90 pound 4'10\" woman had something happen to her or accused someone after a misunderstanding because she becomes extremely flirty and crawls into men's laps after 2 drinks, for example. It's better to protect yourself by not being alone with anyone under substances tbh.", "Yes, in fact it's been happening in multiple cases ever since metoo decided that we need to believe women, and some women decided to take advantage any time they want to ruin a man's life. To actually believe that every single woman is telling the absolute truth every time is insane. It's gotten to the point where you can have perfectly consentual sex with a woman, enjoy yourselves, then she gets pissed off you didn't call her and a week later can go back and say yeah I didn't consent, and you legit get charged for it... And people wonder why men are being cautious?", "Exactly. Why is this bs top comment", "Most likely? Yeah, worst thing that would most likely happen would be puke in the car or something fairly minor. Yet 3 drunk women in a car with a strange man taking them to their house with zero witnesses is setting himself up for disaster. I don't blame anyone for covering their ass when it comes to that. Just imagine someone making up a lie, and you being kicked out of college, possibly losing out on jobs in the future, losing friends who don't believe you, drowning you in legal fees, and potentially getting you on the sex registry list. I'll put it this way, the odds of getting struck by lightning are insanely low, but do you go outside holding a metal rod during a storm? I sure as hell don't. All the guys who have had false allegations have one thing in common, they all wish they would have been more cautious around women in those scenarios.", "Or trying to force their way into his car, or standing in front of it to block him from leaving, etc.  \n\nDrunk people do stupid things, no shame in lying to them to resolve the situation without unnecessary conflict.", "3000", "Yeah I don't understand reddit sometimes, but I also don't really care about karma.

An accusation is that an accusation not actual proof you are not going to jail, we are not in the medieval era in USA or Europe, even in South America.", "Exactly, sometimes it's the people you least expect.\n\nAltough op would have a natural strength advandage it would be three to one.", "Wait you are saying people need to be 'more' careful about being falsely accused than to SA, like is worst, are you serious? You have to be a male of course to dare to write that.", "Lol, so metoo decided we need to believe women, before that what was, never believe women? is so funny how men really think they are victims of women in this world.", "I doubt you will go to prison for being falsely accused stop seeing too much ben shapiro and all that conservative people in YouTube, is more probably you will have a heart attack, cancer, even more likely to go for other minor crimes, seriously go outside and look at the real world not fake news, focus on things that actually can happen.", "I don\u2019t think they were saying that false accusations are worse than sa. At least I hope they weren\u2019t. I think they were saying people need to not put themselves in situations where false accusations can made. I.e. this scenario where 3 intoxicated girls want to get in a strangers car, and nothing can be provided as proof that something didn\u2019t occur in the car like a camera or tracking abilities.", "What are you even saying? Why are you trying to politicize a random fear I have? Get the fuck over yourself. Just because you have no interaction with human beings doesn't mean I'm not allowed to have fears of being wrongfully imprisoned. Holy shit. I don't even know what that has to with fake news or Ben Shapiro. People have been wrongfully imprisoned since for fucking ever. HOLY SHIT you're an idiot.", "Of course can be proof like making an examination to see if it something happen by being force and SA kit I think is called when they can search semen, but the reason I think he thinks is worse is because he wrote \"be MORE careful\" about accusations after mentioning SA.", "Because you have this fear because those politics YouTubers started it, you know the probability is very low, is more likely you can kill someone and get away with it rather than being falsely accused, yeah it used to happen more  centuries ago, but now you are here in reddit, someone can even solve a case with proof from tiktok come on, the one who seems to don't interact is you because I assume you are sooo afraid to be falsely accused that you don't talk to a lot of people right?", "I don't think that was the intent with the use of the word more. They were just saying that people should be more careful than they currently are when it comes to protecting themselves against false accusations, as people don't always think to protect themselves from those scenarios, not that it's a worse event.", "The only argument back on your sa kit, is that it can\u2019t differentiate between rough but consensual contact and sa every time. That\u2019s what the issue with the Duke Lacrosse case was. I hope you know I am not trying to compare which is worse here. They are both terrible and both have zero place in this world. No person should fear that they will be sa\u2019ed, just as no person should fear that when they do something nice or the contact was consensual that they will be accused of something they didn\u2019t do."]}
