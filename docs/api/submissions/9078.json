I live on the same land with my sister and mother though we all have different homes. I was trying to add some context to the situation. \n\nAnyway, tonight, my son and I were snuggling and he was telling this and that about his game, and all of a sudden he asked me to take my arm from around his waist. He told me his tummy hurt. What he described was indigestion. About 20 minutes after, I went to go get him and my cold meds since he, I and mom are all Ill at the moment. \n\nHe asked for a package of peanut butter crackers. Naturally, I said no after what he had just told me. She then asked \u201cwhy can\u2019t he have some if he\u2019s hungry?\u201d To which I responded \u201cbecause he just ate supper at 6:38.\u201d  I take medication to control epilepsy as best they can and had logged it right after I gave him his supper plate.  I made no mention of the indigestion as I honestly don\u2019t feel I should have to justify myself or what I feel is best for my son.\n\nAfter I went and cooled off, I went back and took my cold meds and told her the rundown I gave here. What he had described and all. I got this response:\n\u201cIf I had known I would have backed you up, I just wanted to know why you wouldn\u2019t let him have crackers.\u201d I then told her it really wasn\u2019t her place to know why I made that decision and her doing this over and over again is a lot of the reason he\u2019s not been listening to me. She said it was her right to know and I told her he is not her son and she needs to stop trying to control my decisions concerning him.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for telling her that she doesn\u2019t need to know why I\u2019ve said no to my son?", "created_utc": 1675478833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10t2zu4/aita_for_telling_my_mother_she_doesnt_need_to/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well, they don't get to do that again.\n\nI don't entirely think she was trying to undermine you... she could have just been curious... but I'm with you, don't ask in front of my kid. \n\nAnd you say she's done this before/she thinks she has a right to know? Absurd. I'd start replying to your mom with \"Because I said so\", lol\n\nNTA", "NTA. Her relentless questioning is direct undermining. If course it's going to lead your son to doubt your judgement. She needs to cease and desist NOW.", "NTA and you need to further stand your ground on her not interfering with decisions regarding your child if this occurs regularly.", "Nta, based on your comment that she always does this. Plus isnt open minded to other\u2019s choices on parenting outside of hers. She is majorly overstepping and undermining in front of your child. She is refusing a boundary you are trying to set.\n\nHopefully your septic tank gets fixed soon and you can move out.", "NTA, she's undermining your authority with your child. She has no right to know as you are the parent, not her.", "Everyday interactions like that are not your mother\u2019s right to know. NTA. Please don\u2019t doubt yourself", "You hit it on point.

She's not entitled to information you don't feel like giving either, though I definitely think the primary issue is questioning your decisions right in front of the kid.

Yes, it is your son, and you don't have to have her approval.\n\nBut it's awkward and uncomfortable, as someone who's been in your mothers position. Imagine thinking there's a hungry child in your house. She did the right thing, asked you, she didn't go behind your back and feed the child. \n\nAs long as it's a reasonable question, I would be inclined to be polite. Its to your benefit that this arrangement continues to work.", "ESH", "Sorry for this, but ESH.  She didn\u2019t NEED to know, but it would\u2019ve helped.

When you're sick it's common to not be the most forgiving, level-headed, and wonderful version of yourself. She's hovering. You sound sensitive and like you didn't hear her with kind ears on, with a kind filter, especially given that she's doing you a favor with the living situation.  There's maybe a tinge of entitlement while you're judging the opinions of family on your family land but all in all, there don't seem to be any winners or losers here.  Hope y'all feel better and get some rest.  Fresh eyes and a new day probably resolves this.", "ESH. She is an AH for questioning your decisions. You shouldn't have to explain yourself.

It\u2019s just up to you as his mother. Why does your mum think she\u2019s part of the jury?! \n\nAnd I think the way you handled this situation was really calm and considered.", "She doesn't have a right to know but you could've just clarified. Why make potential conflict?", "YTA. You\u2019re in her house, and you said something that didn\u2019t make sense without context.

I\u2019d probably just get yelled at like always. \ud83d\ude02 my son hates it when she starts doing that. I tell him I appreciate him trying to be kind, but people don\u2019t always agree with each other and I\u2019m not in danger just because there are raised voices. It just Eros me because I treat him like I wish people had done to me as a kid, but Asperger\u2019s wasn\u2019t as well understood by doctors and such. So I give him explanation for why I say no, because it helps him to understand that there is a logical reason for it. So he\u2019s been kinda wild here since these things are a thing. I hope we can go home soon too. We do much better with space. Lol .", "Why do u feel sorry for the mother ?", "I don\u2019t mind telling her out of his hearing, but she\u2019s got this idea because I am legally blind, hard of hearing with hearing aids, and ASD aside from seizures that I\u2019m not able to make any decisions concerning him. She\u2019s been angry with me since I stood up to her over his vaccinations and still has tried to convince me that he and I have autism because of them. So there\u2019s a lot of friction there already but I know she loves us both very much. That\u2019s never been a question for me, but he hears these things all the time and has taken to trying to get his way by saying I said yea to something, or such. That was my main point to her during the whole thing afterwards.", "Thanks. I don\u2019t think it would bother me except this has been an ongoing issue for the last four years or so. I have tried talking to her about it privately multiple times and it still persists. What I am most confused by though, is she had literally just been saying that he has been eating too many snacks.", "They just added information in a comment that this happens with every single decision that's made regarding their son. Why can't he have crackers, why does, he have to go to bed, why can't he wear an outfit with clashing colors, why can't he get a new (whatever the fad toy is at the minute), that would get so old and they've been living there for a year. An entire year of this sounds miserable to me! I know you didn't know this because I didn't immediately either! \ud83d\ude0a", "She saw the child eat dinner a few minutes before.. How hungry could he be?    Sounds like grandma just wanted to be the \"good cop\"", "Op explain in another comment that her mom does this every parenting decision she makes. That her mom isnt open minded either. She believes she knows best and her opinion is the correct one.", "Op mom asked in front of op child. You should never question a parent in front of their child. If you choose to question pull them aside. Asking in front the child being told no shows undermining the parenting. That allows for push back or the child understanding that the other person disagrees with the answer.", "This happens with every decision I make concerning him. Literally every one. He has been upset since this whole living situation has been going on almost a year. It honestly getting on everyone\u2019s nerves. I have tried sitting her down and talking to her about this since he was about 3 and she refuses to respect me. I\u2019ve told her I\u2019d be happy to explain to her why since I remember how my grandparents were so her concerning myself and my sister, and I\u2019d think she\u2019d understand because of that, but it\u2019s kind of her personal opinion she\u2019s never wrong no matter how she tries to tell others otherwise.", "> I hope we can go home soon too.

She posted that after my comment.", "I agree with that point but still ESH.", "Definitely NTA! However, this would definitely help if people knew this when reading initially. I was thinking NTA personally anyway, but wondering why cause the conflict over it. However, this cleared it up!
