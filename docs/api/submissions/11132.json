We had to clean out our sons old room when we moved a couple years back. That felt weird and sort of uncomfortable, he had a childhood of stuff. So we kept what we found important, sent him most of his things, and tossed out the obvious garbage. But frankly I'd have preferred he do it himself.", "NTA. They were your belongings. What else did he expect when he took your husband aside and told him he's getting a dumpster and cleaning out your old room? I don't understand your father's actions in this situation at all.", "NTA. This was a power move gone wrong. Dad tells husband and then you beg dad not to get the dumpster was the intention. Dad then relents after enough pleas but keeps the \u2018dumpster\u2019 hanging over your head for future use if needed. But what\u2019s this?? OP takes Dad at his word and removes a wonderful source of manipulation over OP (the things). Now what has Ol Dad got!! No wonder he\u2019s annoyed/s", "NTA - Is there a chance that your dad is in the early stages of some form of dementia? This type of confusion and distress in older adults (when it is not a long established personality trait) can be an early sign of dementia.", "NTA and it doesn\u2019t matter what you are supposed to think. The items are yours so you do what you want with your belongings.  Your dad is being weird. There must be something else actually going on that he can\u2019t is won\u2019t talk about. Maybe he is afraid of empty nest syndrome", "NTA \n\nYou are married and have your own home.  Definitely time to clean out your childhood room", "NTA - what were you supposed to think he was going to do when he said he was going to get a dumpster??? Your dad is being unreasonable. Let him be angry...consequences of his own actions.", "NTA. \n\nOP, it sounds like your father might have some underlying mental health issues. \n\nJust to be clear: He tells your husband that he\u2019s going to get a dumpster to clean out \u201cthe kids rooms\u201d. You don\u2019t want your things thrown out, so you clean out the room and take the belongings that you care about. At the end of the day, those items are yours. \n\nTo keep the peace, perhaps call your dad and let him know that you were quite worried that you were going to lose your belongings. \n\nI would ask for specific examples of what he is / was planning on putting in this dumpster. \n\nIt sounds like he didn\u2019t have a plan and is regretting it", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. You have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA\n\nI think your brother is.  He wants the extra room to move his stuff and have an office at home too. He didn't count on having your dad get upset about it when you took your things. I don't think it went as planned between your brother and your father. I think they even circumvented you on purpose by going to your husband.", "Nta ask him, 'if you aren't throwing stuff out, why would you be renting a dumpster?'", "\"The Iranian yogurt is not the issue\". Your father is apparently experiencing some cognitive dissonance. On the one hand he wants those rooms cleared out. Understandable, who doesn't want more free real estate...but really it makes sense he'd want to be able to use a \"spare room\".\n\nOn the other hand this is more final, you've officially grown up, moved on, you're not his \"baby\" anymore. You're still his child, but you don't need him like you did, you're more peers now. Often controlling parents don't do well with this shift, because they like feeling superior. \n\nGood news, none of this is your problem. NTA.", "NTA - There was no reason to tell your husband about a dumpster, whose purpose is to discard things, if there wasnt an intention of getting rid of your things. The ONLY thing I can think of that he MAY have been trying to say is that he wants you to come by more often, but then he needs to work on his choice of words.", "NTA assuming they\u2019re your own things you took. Sounds like your dad is going through some early emotional empty-nester syndromes. But you don\u2019t owe him an apology.", "NTA- what the heck is going on? this makes no sense. you acted reasonably.", "NTA...It appears that there are some communication issues in your family, but it's your stuff. Your father said he was getting a dumpster.  What else on earth could that mean other than he's going to throw stuff away? When he's done being angry, he won't have to worry about your things in the room any longer. You don't have to apologize, but you should probably talk about it.", "NTA\n\nDo not apologize.  He literally said he was going to toss your stuff in a dumpster.   He can live with the consequences of his actions.  Let things simmer down and either he'll call you or you can call him and tell him why you had to protect your things.\n\n\"My brother is asking me to apologize\"\n\nYour brother just wants peace and quiet.  He doesn't care about fair or your reasons.  Don't listen to him.", "So a few years ago, my parents were getting their house ready to list their home that week, and my mom called complaining that I still had a bunch of stuff in my old room and it was added work for her to clean up. I didn\u2019t even realize I had stuff there still, and she really laid the guilt on thick, so I dropped the kids off at my friend\u2019s house until my husband could get them, and drove the three hours to her house. When I showed up, I said my hellos and then went right to work, and cleaned out my old closet. It was basically some old prom dresses, old binders of school work from high school, and CD cases. I cleaned it out in a couple of hours, and then had to head home. My mom was so upset with me, which didn\u2019t make any sense at all! But I think it came down to the fact that she was stressed about how much junk they had, and instead of admitting that they were in over their head in junk, they could put that blame on the kids. I don\u2019t think she expected me to actually come back and clean it up, and was embarrassed that she had made a big deal over something that actually wasn\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nSit your parents down and tell him you're getting mixed messages.  Like others have said it sounds like some sort of mental deterioration or emotional issue is happening.  Swinging from getting a dumpster to overreacting to an adult cleaning out their childhood room is a sign something is wrong.", "NTA, for me it's the fact that your father told the husband about the dumpster and not you, than when you started to get your things immediately got pissed, very suspicious, I think he was going to get a dumpster or something but rather than throwing things out he might have wanted to sell them and seeing you take some of your things meant money out the door, but I'm on your side what were you supposed to think after hearing \"dumpster\" and \"kids rooms\"", "NTA. If he wasn't going to throw your stuff out, what was he going to put in the dumpster? Air?", "NTA, this is just bizarre though. Is this a weird one-off for him or does he tend to become upset over dumb shit easily? If this is strange behavior for him I would just ask him directly, assuming you haven't already.\n\n\"Hey dad, I understand you're upset that I picked up my old things. When you told (husband) you were getting a dumpster to clean up our old rooms, I thought it would make it easier on you if I first took the items I wanted. It wasn't my intention to upset you. Can you help me understand what you're feeling?\"\n\nIdk, something like that. I don't think you owe him an apology at all, but I'd be wanting to pry this open and find out what the hell is up with him. \n\nAlso, what's your mom's perspective on this? Is she upset? Was there even a dumpster plan in place, or was your dad selling your husband a weird line?\n\nBaffling.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you apologize?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: \"nd my dad has been interrupting my brother's work to complain\" .. This is between your brother and your dad, Not YOUR drama.", "NTA what was he expecting to happen? He essentially stated his intention to trash everything you still had there, and not even to you. To your husband. Very bizarre.", "NTA\n\nYour father did not discuss his plan with you, and it's not safe for you to assume that he wouldn't throw away things you want to keep. The only person who knows what you want to keep is you. You took action to protect and preserve your property. Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA\n\n>\"Getting a dumpster didn't mean I was going to throw your stuff away.\" \n\nAsk him what it did mean then.\n\nDo you think the old boy is losing his marbles, or was this actually your mother's idea?", "NTA. His actual words said disposal, regardless of what he later said his intent was. \n\nI do not understand why he is so upset you took your stuff when you had long since moved out. Was he using your stuff to somehow push you to visit? Or was it filling up space he wanted to use?", "NAH. Your Dad is struggling with the end of a big part of his life. It\u2019s hard for parents to let go of your childhood.", "NTa. He literally said he was going to throw your stuff out. But side note it didn\u2019t belong there anymore once you move.", "One person mentioned he probably wanted to hold them hostage to get me to visit more - you want something? Better come get it or it's getting tossed. Hey, your mom and I just found this - did you want it? Better come get it then!", "This... actually makes a lot of sense. Thank you for explaining! I felt like I was going crazy.", "I'm aware - I can't fault my brother for trying, though. And I do feel bad that this situation has started to effect him.", "I only grabbed what was mine - a lot of my old stuff belongs to my parents, so I couldn't take it. They'll still have to clean out the room, I just took my things.", "There's a chance, but it'd have to be a really specific dementia because he doesn't act like this towards anyone else", "Yes. This is miscommunication.", "He would be livid if I called him and told him I was worried about losing my things. He's told me over and over again he wasn't going to throw anything out without talking to me first. That's the problem - he's offended I was worried he was going to throw my stuff out after he told my husband he was renting a dumpster to throw my stuff out.", "My brother isn't an asshole, and he definitely didn't plan this with my dad. He's just trying to move out.", "He keeps saying he wouldn't have thrown anything out without talking to me.", "See, that would make sense, if he didn't already two spare rooms and a separate hobby space for himself! Also, they're already using my old room as storage - a bunch of my brother's stuff is in there until he moves out. Its essentially a guest bedroom with some of my old stuff in there. They've even redone it, so it doesn't look like my old room anymore.", "He does want us to visit more often, but it's a three hour drive for us, and he and my mom still try to be very controlling (like I'm in high school instead of a married adult), so we don't go often. He was actually complaining about us not visiting enough in between telling me I didn't need to take my stuff.", "I genuinely have no idea.", "He's not going to be done being angry.", "I understand my brother just wants peace and quiet, but he does care about being fair and my reasons. It's just gotten to the point where it's effecting his work, and he can't move out if he gets fired. \n\nAlso, things will not simmer down any time soon. This is going to be a problem for a long time.", "Sitting them down and talking to them is out of the question - they'd just start screaming at me for being disrespectful, and we would get nowhere fast.", "He does want to sell stuff - he's been telling me that for a while. But he bought all the stuff he wants to sell, so I couldn't have stopped him anyway. I left everything he bought so if he does want to sell something, it should still be there for him.", "The world may never know.", "He and my mom have always had weird hair triggers - the smallest things would set them off for weeks, if not months. \n\nI did actually try to talk a bit about it when I was there alone picking up the rest of my stuff, but my dad just kept repeating some variation of \"you didn't need to take your stuff just because I was getting a dumpster\".\n\nMom doesn't care.", "Probably my mother's idea - when she saw I was packing, she laughed and asked if I needed a bag.", "You're not going crazy.  I promise. \ud83d\ude01", "YOu were still right to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu just made the error of believing your dad ... but better this way than finding your stuff thrown away.", "And that's totally acceptable. He had a lot of personal papers and stuff I didn't really want to read through, they were his personal things. So I boxed that up and sent it to him to decide what to do with, and sent up the toys and items I knew he'd want or that he'd asked for, and we kept some stuff he said he didn't want but we thought were important like his graduation tassel, certificates for various things, etc. We didn't send the furniture because he didn't have space and we just use it in the guest bedroom at the new house.", "The thing is, I don't think this is something for you to be mad about.  Take your stuff,  you're a grown up. And he may not have said quite what what your husband thinks he said. When repeated,  information gets bungled as its passed along. He may have been joking.  As most parents,  we have a lot of stuff we no longer need and we think about it. \" Why is this stuff here?\" Your dad may have said \"sometimes I think we should get a dumpster and...\"  You could have calmed down, talked to your dad, said \"its ok, i was meaning to do that\"   No ah here,  just miscommunication.", "Thank you for clarifying. \n\nIn that case, I go back to what on earth was / is he planning on throwing out that he needs a dumpster. In my mind I\u2019m imaging that this is a multi yard dumpster and not one of those little bags you buy at Home Depot.", "Let's say this was true. In that case you'd still be doing exactly what you're doing now, clearing out the room. So there wouldn't be any problem with you doing it now. I wonder if he wanted to get a negative reaction from you and is mad that he didn't.", "I've got nothing then. I'm just going based on him still calling it \"your room\" and the fact that he was planning to get a dumpster. Having a room filled with junk that's not being used always seems strange and wasteful to me.", "Based off of all of this, it sounds to me like this is just an additional attempt to control you. Your parents are trying to make you behave a certain way and keep you under their thumb even though you are a married adult. By keeping some of your belongings at their place and occasionally threatening to get rid of them (but then trying to keep them there by saying they weren't actually going to), they can force you to visit while maintaining control over some of your property, all under the guise of being generous parents allowing you to store stuff in your old room.\n\nHe is mad that he is losing something he could control some of your behavior with, aka your stuff. He could have mentioned the dumpster thinking that it would make you come over more in an attempt to keep him from trashing your belongings, but didn't consider the alternative of you just taking them with you. Now he is mad because he no longer has your stuff at his place and you have less of a reason to make the trip to their house. I am sympathetic to your brother having to deal with your dad's pettiness, but you don't need to apologize and shouldn't. You are a grown adult, married, and living several hours away. It is very reasonable for you to finally just take the belongings you want home with you. It is reasonable for you to not visit all the time, especially if your folks don't treat you like the independent adult you are. \n\nAt most I would tell your dad that you are sorry he is upset but you decided it is time to get your belongings home so they aren't a three hour drive away, and his mentioning a dumpster was the encouragement you needed to finally just do it. If he pushes back and insists he wasn't going to throw stuff out and you can leave it, then ask why he told your husband he was going to get a dumpster to clean out your old room if he wasn't going to throw things away.", "And that is understandable. Sounds totally justifiable to not visit that often for many reasons, but I will BET that is why he made that comment and now that your belongings are gone, he feels you will have LESS reason to come by. Have you talked to him about how he is with you and your sibling?", "Was it some desperate ploy to make you visit? Like in the old joke?\n\n\nAn dad calls his son in London the day before Christmas Eve and says, \u201cI hate to ruin your day but I have to tell you that your mother and I are divorcing.\u201d\n \n\n\u201cDad, what are you talking about?\u201d the son screams.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stand the sight of each other any longer,\u201d the father says. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of each other and I\u2019m sick of talking about this, so you call your sister and tell her.\u201d\n\nThe son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone. \u201cLike heck they\u2019re getting divorced!\u201dshe shouts, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this!\u201d\n\nShe calls immediately, and screams at her father, \u201cYou are NOT getting divorced. Don\u2019t do a single thing until I get there. I\u2019m calling my brother back, and we\u2019ll both be there tomorrow. Until then, don\u2019t do a thing, DO YOU HEAR ME?\u201d and hangs up.\n\nThe old man hangs up his phone and turns to his wife. \u201cSorted! They\u2019re coming for Christmas\"", "Then he shouldn't be having a problem like he is, who knows what goes through our parents minds at times like these", "What then was the dumpster for?", "Hmm. Sinister...", "My dad has confirmed he said exactly what my husband told me he said - that he was going to get a dumpster and clean out \"the kids'\" rooms in the next few weeks. It was a definite plan he and my mom had. \n\nI also wasn't angry. I didn't yell or get mad. I just started cleaning out my room. Then my dad got mad that I was cleaning out my room. I'm still not angry about it now - just confused.", "Exactly! To me (and my husband), a dumpster implies you're... you know... dumping everything. I didn't even have a lot in my room - it's actually mostly my brother's stuff in there now, but he's still living there, so it's not like they're throwing away his stuff. The vibe I got was that they were going to clean out my room to make more space for someone else's stuff.", "Absolutely not. He'd be explosively angry if we tried to talk to him about how he treats my brother and I.", "Maybe, but he would have had to have mentioned a day they'd be renting the dumpster. He didn't, just did they'd be getting one and cleaning out our rooms \"soon\". And we don't live nearby, so it's not like we could have just popped over and helped when they finally rented it.", "No idea. He was going to throw stuff out, but not until he talked to me, but he didn't even talk to me about getting a dumpster. I don't know.", "That's just who she is.", "Wow. He sounds like a lot of fun to be around. \n\nYou're NTA. Your actions were a reasonable response to what he said.", "Laughed like she was glad you were clearing stuff out, or laughed like she knew this would be the source of drama?", "so it was probably nothing to do with dad\n\npoor old guy", "I don't know, she just kinda giggles sometimes. I don't know if it means anything.", "I mean, my dad is the one who mentioned the plan to my husband, so he was aware of it. And he wasn't against the plan, either, until I started taking the things I didn't want thrown out.", "This is all very puzzling. The whole place seems to be (forgive me) something of a madhouse.", "Trust me, the dynamics of growing up in that house was wild."]}
