Some people, including my parents, believe that I should be the \"bigger person\" and shift my wedding date to ease the strain on our family and friends.

Her sister doesn\u2019t has to plan her life around OP\u2019s wedding.", "> Your sister knew what she was doing. \n\nMiddle of the week wedding, planned in less than four months, the day after a holiday, 20 days before another middle of the week wedding that people have already been planning for?\n\nDamn right she knew what she was doing. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear you won\u2019t be able to come Aunt Millie, but I understand. You already committed to sis\u2019s wedding.\u201d As she crosses off one more expensive meal she doesn\u2019t have to pay for.", "You mean OP is a selfish brat. She\u2019s the one with the issue.", "OP\u2019s moment is on July 25th. That\u2019s her only moment. July doesn\u2019t belong to her. Plenty of families attend weddings in the same month and it doesn\u2019t take away from the significance of the events.", "Kinda agree. \n\nSince both of you wants to have your weddings in July, then so be it. But pls do not be angry at her for also choosing july. There shouldnt be a competition to begin with, and no discussions to be made.\n\nDon\u2019t make things difficult for the both of you and for your family. \n\nLastly, your family was only telling you to change your wedding date bec it was you who had some issues with the weddings on the same month to begin with..", "Sorry, meant July. Edited the post for clarity.", "It sounds like OP already has save the dates and invites out so I'd assume people have already made accommodations for hers. If they can't afford to squeeze in the sister, well that sucks for the sister, but oh well.", "These aren\u2019t even weekends. July 5th is a Wednesday and the 25th is a Tuesday.", "Do we know if the family has to travel though? OP hasn't specified. It's all about stealing the thunder which is petty. I'm not saying the situation is ideal but if OP's sister wants a summer wedding (like most people do) it's pretty much going to be either close to OP's wedding date or have to be next year and maybe the sister doesn't want to wait a year.", "Working weekends had nothing to do with either sister\u2019s wedding.", "Ones a Tuesday and ones a Wednesday!! Honestly she needs add the midweek nonsense to it", "I don\u2019t think so. If the venue is her dream venue, it must be really popular. Popular venues are usually booked completely up to two years in advance. Some people don\u2019t want to wait that long to get married so her sister agreed to a date that episode allow her to get married at her dream venue in her desired time frame.", "But if she already had the date set for a year, wouldn't you as a family member from out of state have made plans for that already?", "Yeah that\u2019s what I was thinking, I feel like a lot of the YTA votes aren\u2019t considering family coming in from different parts of the country. If my sister and I threw weddings 20 days a part very few people would probably be able to attend both or at least not without using a significant amount of PTO and costs all within a short timeframe", "I get why she\u2019d worry about this, but chances are people will go the the wedding they\u2019ve known about the longest as they would have booked time off, travel and hotels for it already ages ago.", "This is exactly the problem. The only saving grace, so to speak, OP may have is that sister\u2019s wedding is short notice, so family members may not be able to 1) save enough for a second trip; 2) arrange travel; and 3) find & pay for accommodations so quickly.", "OP wedding is a TUESDAY. The first one is a Wednesday but at least near a holiday", "The parents. It says so right in the post. The bit you're referring to in fact.", "Yes, but only in response to OP's reaction. \n\nHer sister did not come to her and ask her to move her wedding. Nor did her parents initiate this either. \n\nIn response to OP overreacting to her sister choosing a date weeks away from OPs wedding, her parents seem to be saying something akin to \"Look, if this is such an issue for you maybe you can move your own wedding rather than continuing the Drama.\"\n\nIn this case, encouraging OP to be the \"bigger person\" seems to be a plea for her to stop being the smaller one, rather than asking her to graciously step aside to make way for her sister. \n\nFrom their perspective they're trying to keep the peace. As it doesn't appear OP's sister did anything wrong, and it would be wildly inappropriate to ask the sister to modify her behavior to mollify OP, the only thing they can really do aside from asking OP to chill out is to proffer potential things OP can do to deescalate, e.g moving her wedding date.", "Yeah I've seen a lot of that argument in the NTA comments, but given that OP did not (a) suggest that was a thing, or (b) raise that as a part of her concerns, I have no more reason to assume that she has people flying out than I do to assume that she's having a destination wedding, will now need to cancel an appearance by Bono, or had knowledge that should her sister be married before her the prophecy will be fulfilled and bring about the end of time.\n\nThere are a whole host of potential contextual reasons that could change my verdict, but I'm not going engage in a conspiratorial guessing game where I make up potentialities and proceed as though those assumptions are facts when nothing of the sort has been claimed by OP.", "Damnit... you are correct. Good catch.", "I reread it and I don't see where sister is throwing a fit. Was it edited?", "Sister hasn\u2019t thrown a fit about OP not changing her date, she\u2019s the one who said they are both adults and can handle weddings 20 days apart. Based on OPs whole attitude OP probably said \u201cYou have to change your date because I refuse to change mine!\u201d", "Nowhere in the OP does sister throw a fit.\n\nFollow your own advice and read properly next time.", "OP said it was \"unfair\" and her sister is \"stealing her thunder.\" If that's not a temper tantrum, then I don't know what is. I don't see anywhere that the sister threw a fit.\n\nThe sister tried to resolve it by saying they were adults, and nobody needed to change dates. OP made it a problem, not the sister.", "No, if I was getting married and it had been planned and arranged for a year and my sister comes along and wants to get married in same month? Yeah, that\u2019s a selfish decision. Weddings cost an absolute fortune and putting your family and friends through two in a month is not fair. Fair enough if venue had to be that specific day, but she could have had a conversation with OP and discussed this like adults.", "1. Plenty of families can\u2019t attend two in the same month for financial reasons if they live far away.\n2. Op planned longer and sister already knew her date when she chose her date only weeks earlier. This makes it seem she\u2019s trying to steal the attention from her  sister by choosing a date less then 3 weeks before her sister.\n3. July doesn\u2019t belong to her, op isn\u2019t saying it does . But it is disrespectful on her sisters part to choose a date that could affect both of their weddings", "I think they're both AH of those are the actual dates!", "If those  are the real dates,  wouldn't  op have already  sent out invitations? Are they  assuming  people  will have rsvped and are changing  to no because  they'd  rather  go to the sibling's?", "It\u2019s pretty rare that extended family in this day and age are all within the same township, so a reasonable assumption is that most weddings would include at least some people having to travel.", "That's kinda tough shit though. One sister wants a particular venue and the other is set on a particular date. There's not much to be done here.\nEdit: also wouldn't people be more likely to go to the one that they were given a year's notice on?", ">I've refused to change my date. We were engaged first, planned first, and now she's upset, saying I'm being unsupportive and ruining what should be a happy time for us both.\n\nSorry but that one paragraph sorta ruins any point you're trying to make her. She's refused to change her date and her sisters doing all that", "Nah, it's just typed in a weird way because OP is trying to say that the sister is both okay with there being two weddings that month and wants OP to change her date. I'm assuming one of these is a lie. I wonder which?", "Then sister got mad and got the parents to push op to change her date since it would be too hard for family to do 2 weddings.", "The only ones who MIGHT be inconvenienced are the parents and that\u2019s only if they are paying for both weddings. Anyone else can choose to not attend both weddings. Sister is planning a middle of the week wedding the day after a holiday in less than four months and doing so knowing that her sister had been planning a middle of the week wedding later in the month, I\u2019m sure she knows people have already begun planning to attend OPs wedding and it may affect her own wedding attendance.", "OP doesn\u2019t say that her sister is pressuring family members to attend her wedding over OP\u2019s. For all we know, she could care less who comes as long as she gets married in her dream venue. As for stealing the attention, that\u2019s ridiculous. Like I said, the only day OP deserves to have the spotlight to herself is on July 25th. People don\u2019t have to plan their lives around someone else\u2019s wedding. If friends and family members can\u2019t attend both weddings, they should do the honorable things and go to OP\u2019s. As long as OP\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t give them grief for doing that, there\u2019s no problem.", "OP isn\u2019t \u201cset\u201d on a particular date. Deposits were put down a year ago - it\u2019s a matter of not losing money on the venue, caterers, etc.", "I reread it again. Where does the sister say she wanted OP to change her date?", "Nowhere does it say the sister sent the parents to talk to OP about changing her date.\n\nThe sister is the one trying to resolve this and prevent changes, so assuming she sent the parents after OP doesn't even make sense.", "Those are just reasons for her being set on the date? What's your point here? I didn't say that she didn't have very good reasons to be set on the date, my point was kinda the opposite really.", "She doesn't, but OP tried to give that impression by saying that she was refusing to change the date and sister saying that shes being unsupportive. It's the same with the title. OP wants people to think that the conflict is her not changing the date, even though it's her who wants her sister to change the date.", "Because she won't get a refund. Her sister got engaged and is impatient to get married before her."]}
