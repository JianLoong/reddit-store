You have every right to have rules and boundaries in your house, but this kid likely already deals with abandonment issues from his parents, and threatening to kick him out basically over being annoying and being inattentive to your boundaries- a teenage specialty- is going to be more hurtful than any performance review you might recieve from your job.\n\nSaying that, yes you do have the right to have your rules respected in your home. What is the gf's home situation like? If she has a tough time at home she might see your house as a safe place to escape to. It's worth sitting them both down and having a kind but firm talk with them about what is expected of them. First of all, nephew is 18 and that's old enough to contribute towards tidying the house- this would make you more comfortable with guests and he should be doing this already quite frankly. Second, work hours are what keeps the lights on and food on the table, this needs to be respected.\n\nYou are going to have to excercise a bit of give and take here. 18 is old enough to know when they are getting the bad end of the stick, and respect begets respect with teenagers.

Then, as you say, they can make all the noise they want.", "NTA he can live with his grandparents", ">I think outside of the work day, making someone who lives with you ask to have a guest over is heavy handed\n\nMaybe, but I think OP would just appreciate a heads up in advance like, \"hey auntie gf is coming over later this morning\" it's basic respect when living with a housemate and given that the nephew is 18, that's essentially what this living situation is now.", "Seems way too harsh for no reason.", "Nah", "He's an adult but she's a bit extreme as well, if she's on work hours, it's 100% valid. If it's late night I can agree as well. Other than that, he lives there too, probably sees her close to a mother figure. His gf can't visit ? Has to make an appointment ? As she said, she was sick and has the cleaning issues, she probably over reacted to it all because of it.", "When you're living with someone it's just the considerate thing to do, even if it's on weekend, you never know how the person is feeling, maybe she wants to relax after the work week and the last thing she needs are some guests.\n\nEven if the aunt and nephew had the most harmonious living arrangement on earth, asking first before bringing anyone home is just the polite thing to do.", "Regardless of who it is it\u2019s common curtesy when living with another person to ask before bringing somebody over especially when you know they\u2019re working and/ or don\u2019t like guests over when the house isn\u2019t clean. She never said the gf can\u2019t visit all she asked was that they be respectful and to let her know before coming over", "NTA I think it would be totally reasonable to say no guests, while you are working, and you just give you some notice if she\u2019s coming over. That way he can still have guests in his home, and you aren\u2019t stressed out so much.", "NTA. \nI'm sure she can visit when you're not working. You've set boundaries that aren't being respected. Perhaps your comment was harsh but he is old enough to understand that you're working and shouldn't be disturbed. \nAlso, he can help keep tidy. \nMy mom works from home and when everyone is home or my sister has friends over, it's understood that you don't go screaming through the house or blasting your music.\nAlso, also, I HATE unannounced visitors. I'm not always appropriately dressed to receive company, lol", "NTA.\n\nBoundaries are important and they\u2019re not being considerate of that. She can still surprise him by telling you she\u2019s coming to surprise him. Have you suggested this option to her to avoid issues?", "Nta, I used to be like you though, and still have my moments of omg no I can't have surprise guests cause my house is untidy. Since I fucked my back up I've given up on this and it's been quite liberating. I highly support you trying it out. Stop giving a crap what people think.\n\nHowever they need to respect your working time and either go out while you're working or be extremely quiet. That's a huge disrespect, imo and needs to be discussed. If she wants to come.over it needs to be during your non working hours, or they can meet out somewhere if they can't keep their noise down. Explain what happens if you don't have a job to him and to you. He's 18 he needs to understand that poor job performance can equal no more job sometimes.", "NTA I am an extreme introvert who can socialize perfectly fine for short periods of time outside in public and I do have friends I hang out with occasionally. But I don\u2019t have guests over. I don\u2019t like people on my house. It feels invasive and I also have the same issue with needing to have my house spotless to feel comfortable inviting someone in. I can relate to how you feel completely. I would gently recommend you start to help your nephew make a plan to move out. He needs his own space as well.", "NTA\n\nHere's food for thought.\n\nPlease get therapy. Having been raised like this just really adds undo stress on you. (spotless house before visitors) \n\nWhy is she trying to \"surprise\" him at home? Trust issues? That's concerning all on its own.", "Ehs. You both need to reach a compromise. You are being too overbearing and harsh. Also i promise the gf is not coming over to judge how clean ur house is", "ESH It's fine to set rules about being quiet when you're working, and the nephew and GF were inconsiderate. But \"no unannounced visitors ever because my house isn't spotless \" is really extreme and unfair. A teenager isn't going to care if your house is messy.", "At 32 when I had two roommates I let them know when I had a guest over. We all paid rent, we all kept the place tidy in common rooms but the point is that we all live there and sometimes walked around bra less, in panties,  without makeup, and would be in meetings or class and had our schedules on our doors, and would love a heads up if someone was going to be there to be mindful to stay in our rooms or to make ourselves semi decent. We had locks to our doors but never used them because we trusted each other and always made sure that if we didn\u2019t know the person coming into the house they stayed in the living room or waited in their vehicle for precaution as we were all small framed college grad kids. OP is asking for the same consideration only for the aesthetics of her home and also because of her work schedule and possibly safety and security. Is this kid paying rent?\n\nIf he clearly has that much time for a gf over to surprise him seeing how she knows he\u2019ll be available, maybe he should get a part time job or something so he can work towards having a place of his own without restrictions.", "NTA, but while I understand the \"messy\" thing (I'm super OCD) I think you would be better off framing the issue by the bigger concern, which is the disrespectful behaviour while you are working in the home. \n\nHe's 18, he won't understand the little bit of dishes or clothes, but if he can not comprehend or at least learn to respect the rules of ensuring you can work efficiently without interruption, then he definitely needs to spend some time with grandparents, maybe during all hours you are at work. \n\nDoes he not work at 18? (Country impacts whether he is still in school or not obv)", "I agree, NTA.\n\nI would say that for a person whose mother dipped out and whose father is not around, threatening to kick them out is likely to cause a big response. It doesn't excuse the behavior beforehand, but he probably has some level of abandonment issues.", "Even with peer roommates it\u2019s considerate to give a heads up that someone\u2019s coming over. That\u2019s a reasonable ask.", "She sounds exhausting. I think a lot of people are giving her a pass here but she is making a non issue into a big deal", "The GF may not even know about the rule,  the \"drop-in\" is normal in some circles. (Not in mine though lol.)", "fr, classic reddit", "It sounds like he's been warned multiple times.", "NTA\nBut is the problem that your place is never tidy or is the problem her showing up unannounced? \nYou keep referring to the place not being tidy. You should work on that if that\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t want people over. Also why isn\u2019t he cleaning up as well? Are both of you messy? \nHonestly a person is going to treat your space how they see you treat it. So he\u2019s not going to clean if you don\u2019t clean. \n\nI do understand that you are setting boundaries as far as being at work and them making noise. I would say have a rule that she can\u2019t come over during work hours.", "NTA - you've discussed it, and it affects your work.  They have a choice - respect your rule on your home, and plan.  Or gtfo.", "NTA I vote let him tidy up the place to your level of tidy, you inspect before the gf comes over. That or like others said, let him live with the grandparents.", "Nta it's your home and work space and then making so much noise is unacceptable. If he doesn't like it he can go live with your parents", "NTA.  He may be at the golden age of \u201cI\u2019m 18, I do what I want\u201d.  Just a guess.  Honestly if he wants to stay and wants visitors, make a of no visits during your work hours.  And go from there", "YTA.", "YTA.\n1, You threatened to abandon a kid who has already been abandoned before.\n2, Your messy house shouldn\u2019t prevent him from having a life. \n3, You are all he really has. But at the same time, he needs to have his own life and experiences. He cannot set boundaries with someone who he is dependent upon. I was in a position like this for my entire formative years, and I am really fucked up because of not being able to experience things I should have. You both need to come to a compromise. \n\nYou say he should ask before she comes over. I don\u2019t believe this would make things better. I bet that if he actually did ask, you would constantly say no, and deny visits. And keep your damn house clean.", "Nta\u2026. That would be my living hell I\u2019ve been in my current home 6 years and my mother has been to my house 4 times 2 of those were for Christmas dinner I just don\u2019t like people in my house yes my house is untidy but not dirt it\u2019s a \u201clived in messy\u201d which I assume yours is too", "NTA, I have that anxiety too. Since nephew's GF obviously has no issue with your untidiness, maybe overlook that IF they can be quiet during work hours. My mom and I had to come to terms with this with my brothers' friends coming over all the time after school. They didn't care about dishes in the sink, piles of laundry, or unswept floors. Heck, they didn't even care about the disasters that were my brothers' rooms. If they can't be quiet while you're working, kick them out of the house until after work. Send them to the movies or her house. They're old enough to know about work hours and quiet time.", "NTA They affected your work with no understanding or respect for your preferences. Of course, you should get the environment you want in your own home.", "NTA He's 18 and you're doing him a huge favor by allowing him to live with you. You seem very generous and seemingly only have the one simple rule that guests call before they come to your house. Your Nephew needs to respect the rule.", "He\u2019s an adult. She doesn\u2019t need to bribe him or \u201ccompromise\u201d him to clean the house in exchange for having company. He\u2019s not 5yrs old. \nSounds like they both need to clean. If he sees that she doesn\u2019t keep a tidy house then he isn\u2019t going to respect the house.", "An adult, who isn\u2019t paying rent. OP should start assigning him chores in exchange for a place to live.", "Many people are fine with really drastic and nuclear acts when they face any kind of problem, many of those would probably get Y T A all the time if they would be judged or they are just that nasty on reddit."]}
