I told my nephew that if she ever comes over unannounced again, I\u2019ll kick him out and they can meet anytime they want without disturbing anybody.

I come from a culture where every single inch of the house has to be cleaned before visitors come over. I have anxiety if I haven\u2019t done this before someone comes over. It\u2019s not a hoarder\u2019s place like someone suggested, more an issue of dirty dishes and clothes laying on chairs type of thing. \n\nI don\u2019t ask him to ask permission every single time she comes over.

You have every right to have rules and boundaries in your house, but this kid likely already deals with abandonment issues from his parents, and threatening to kick him out basically over being annoying and being inattentive to your boundaries- a teenage specialty- is going to be more hurtful than any performance review you might recieve from your job.\n\nSaying that, yes you do have the right to have your rules respected in your home. What is the gf's home situation like? If she has a tough time at home she might see your house as a safe place to escape to. It's worth sitting them both down and having a kind but firm talk with them about what is expected of them. First of all, nephew is 18 and that's old enough to contribute towards tidying the house- this would make you more comfortable with guests and he should be doing this already quite frankly. Second, work hours are what keeps the lights on and food on the table, this needs to be respected.\n\nYou are going to have to excercise a bit of give and take here. 18 is old enough to know when they are getting the bad end of the stick, and respect begets respect with teenagers. Work together to come up with an agreement and be clear about the consequences of disrespecting that greement- but threats of homelessness should be reserved for extreme circumstances that cannot be worked through.\n\nOverall I think NAH as you're in a tough position, but if you don't apologise and make sure this kid feels safe and secure in his home then YWBTA.", "NTA - your not his mom your his aunt and he's lucky to have you. if he can't even be quiet while your working (and keeping a roof over his head) he can go somewhere else. he's 18, you can kick him out at any time and it'd be completely legal, he should remember that.", "You are not the AH for having the rule but threatening to throw him out was an AH move.

Homeboy is 18, acting like that. If he wants to live for free or a reduced rate(I hope you\u2019re charging him at least $300 if he\u2019s not going to school) he better abide by your rules.

That's your  nephew's responsibility as the person that lives there with you and it's his guest. When couples having been seeing each other for a bit it's totally normal that they stop announcing when they are coming by. Also sorry but preventing someone from having people over at the house due to your poor cleanliness is a dick move.

You can kick him out if he's really not following through with expectations", "ESH. The kid was ditched by both his father and his mother. Going directly to kicking out a kid who probably already has abandonment issues seems overly harsh, especially when it is his GF who shows up uninvited. I agree with those who\u2019ve said he needs to be cleaning the house and the GF needs set visiting hours that are enforced. You definitely need to make it understood that they disrupted your work and got you into hot water with work and that needs to stop, but if he is an otherwise good kid, I would not threaten to abandon him.", "Without even reading the context, it's your house, which means it's your rules.

One is being interrupted during your work day, which they absolutely should not be doing and are old enough to stop, fair enough to come down hard on that.\n\nAnother, I think, stems from the fact you are still thinking of his girlfriend as \"a visitor\", and therefore subject to the cleaning standards you hold yourself to for guests. I suspect to your nephew, she's not \"a guest\" in the same way. How long have they been in a relationship? Can you see yourself getting to a point where you can put her in a different category to other people? My serious boyfriend when I was that age definitely came to the house when it was in a state my mum wouldn't allow for visitors, but he was in a different category.

I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect those to be quiet hours. He should've gone out with his girlfriend. Though even if he's by himself, he should not be making a ruckus during her work hours.

Nobody said that he should go get a job and buy a house when all of us know that it's currently impossible.However, how about not excusing this kind of crappy behaviour with \"oh, he's still a child\"? Young, yes, but not foolish. He's old enough to understand the importance of a job that keeps them sheltered.  By the way, the idea that he will mature exactly at 25...
