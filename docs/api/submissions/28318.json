It's not like he's gonna die alone, he's just trying to absolve his guilt... F that. NTA.\n\nI do however wonder if part of the issue here is that because your husband cheated on you multiple times before you left, your kids have normalized cheating as just \"something that happens\" that isn't the huge betrayal most of the world sees it as.", "NTA. If he wanted you there at his deathbed, then he shouldn\u2019t have made the choice that he did. I can understand your children\u2019s frustration, but that doesn\u2019t give them any right to be distant from you or angry. \nI think what you are doing is brave and strong. I\u2019m sure you have had to do a lot of healing to even be at this point right now, to not bend over and give him his last wish, when all you wanted was a lasting marriage. Kudos to you. If I could I would shake your hand. \nBig hugs as I know this cannot be easy. But as humans we have to learn how to live life, to forgive but that never means you have to forget. I think you can send him some flowers or a nice card, but honestly, he doesn\u2019t deserve much more. \n\nEven better, make him a meal he can enjoy with his children. But I would not give him the honor of your presence. That is simply my opinion. Wish him well, but from a distance.. ya know?", "NTA. You took a vow \"til death do us part\" and he broke it many times over and so now he's got to face death solo.  It's as simple as that.", "NTA. He literally f%cked around and now he\u2019s finding out", "NTA he does not get to cheat and keep your support during the hard times.", "NTA - I think it was okay if him to ask.  But its also okay to decline. Its too bad the kids don't accept your choice though.", "NTA. His actions where the reason your two lives got separated. You no longer have any obligation to be around for his death. \n\nI'd go there anyway. Not to sit with him while he's dying, but to see him one last time. He's probably remorseful, maybe wants to get some things off his chest. Imminent death makes people reconsider things, and I'd be curious to hear what he's got to say. \n\nHis children can keep him company at the end.", "NTA.

No one gets to tell you how to grieve, and your kids may not 'get' that you're likely still grieving your marriage, not just the end of his life. You may grieve for the negatives he added to your life for the rest of your own life, and that's understandable.

It\u2019s not cut and dry.", "NTA if you choose not to go, but if going is not completely awful to you then you should probably consider it. He cheated and he's been out of your life for some time but you were obviously a huge part of each others lives, and most importantly it means a lot for your kids. If I was in your situation I'd go at least once, even if just to let him say what he wants to say. At the same time, if you have too many bad memories to go back then it's perfectly fine to stay away.", "His children need to go be with him/ they are AHs. \nHe can\u2019t expect his ex wife, who he treated poorly, to be at his bedside.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s asking you to come in hopes of clearing his conscious before he dies.

They should have more empathy.", "NTA for not going as you have no obligation, but be aware this could affect the relationship with your children.

Always imagined he would die with you by his side... Because he thought he could treat you like shit and walk all over you and you would let him. Don't worship at thia mans feet,  juat because he ia dying doesn't mean he deserves your time. He only wants you now because nobody else wants him. Tell the kids you aren't going but there's nothing stopping them from looking after him.
