It's not like he's gonna die alone, he's just trying to absolve his guilt... F that.

If he wanted you there at his deathbed, then he shouldn\u2019t have made the choice that he did. I can understand your children\u2019s frustration, but that doesn\u2019t give them any right to be distant from you or angry. \nI think what you are doing is brave and strong. I\u2019m sure you have had to do a lot of healing to even be at this point right now, to not bend over and give him his last wish, when all you wanted was a lasting marriage. Kudos to you. If I could I would shake your hand. \nBig hugs as I know this cannot be easy. But as humans we have to learn how to live life, to forgive but that never means you have to forget. I think you can send him some flowers or a nice card, but honestly, he doesn\u2019t deserve much more. \n\nEven better, make him a meal he can enjoy with his children. But I would not give him the honor of your presence. That is simply my opinion. Wish him well, but from a distance.. ya know?", "NTA.

But its also okay to decline. Its too bad the kids don't accept your choice though.", "NTA. His actions where the reason your two lives got separated. You no longer have any obligation to be around for his death. \n\nI'd go there anyway. Not to sit with him while he's dying, but to see him one last time.

You may grieve for the negatives he added to your life for the rest of your own life, and that's understandable.

The fact that he roped your children into his request though is a sneaky underhanded thing to do as a way to strong-arm you into doing what he wants - but he's counting days, so I might cut him some slack.\n\nIt's hard to lose family to cancer, so my heart goes out to your family as you navigate this difficult time.", "It wouldn't make you an asshole, but it's worth remembering that your chances of wrapping up any unfinished business with your ex are dwindling, and very soon, that window will close. \n\nIf you ever think that you'll regret missing that chance to reconnect and leave things at peace between you, you should strongly consider reaching out to him now, because, all too soon, he will be out of your reach forever.", "Yta. He's going to be dead soon. Your kids aren't. I wonder if they will turn up at your death bed to ease your passing.", "YTA. Good god with a cold black heart like that it's no wonder he cheated. Yikes. \n\nYou were married to that man for 27 years, you had 3 children together. You had countless good times, holidays, birthdays, laughs, cries, loving memories, hard times... Yes he cheated and yes you had every right to divorce his ass for it. \n\nBut this is like refusing to piss on someone who's on fire.  That man is literally dying in a hospital bed, taking his last breaths, and you're talking about infidelity as if it happened last week and you didn't already divorce him for it. \n\nGet over yourself before your kids find who you mom really is, don't show them your true colors unless you also want to die alone one day. What you're doing to their dad is a few billion times more unforgivable then cheating. No child (adult or otherwise) will ever forget that.", "YTA. Don't do it for him, do it for your kids. How do you think it looks to them that their mother refuses to at least sit with their father before he dies?", "YWNBTA. Your kids can go. You don\u2019t need to be there.", "[removed]", "NTA why can\u2019t his young little mistress be there?", "Maybe he should try asking that younger woman he ran off with instead. NTA", "NTA. However, sounds like he\u2019s manipulated the children into thinking you are. Since you\u2019re going to have to continue to live with them, I\u2019d make an appearance. Besides, maybe they need you there.", "NTA his children could sit with him.\n\nActions have consequences.\n\nHe doesn't get to run off with a younger woman and sleep around and still expect his wife to pretend nothing happened.", "NTA- You owe him nothing, and it isn't fair of your kids to push this.\n\nHowever, your kids are grieving the loss of their father. Would it make sense for you to drop by the hospital waiting room, maybe drop off some food, to see the kids? Or would they just keep pushing for you to go see your ex?", "NTA\nHe can go sit with his mistresses", "NTA. There's consequences to his actions, not just that you divorced him. He won't be alone. He'll have his kids there. He'll be surrounded by people who love him. Maybe he should ask one of the many women he cheated on you with to be at his bedside while he dies.", "Why doesn't he have any of the young things he cheated on you with help him? Oh that's right they don't care about him at all. Karma lol", "NTA he won\u2019t die alone his children will be with him. I am sorry but he should have thought about not wanting to be alone when he died before he cheated on you multiple times with women who didn\u2019t care.", "Would you feel okay to visit him once? From the perspective that your kids may feel peace in knowing you visited?\n\nIf it is too upsetting to visit, then look after yourself!", "NTA, but I think your children might have benefited from you being there. Yes they\u2019re adults, but they\u2019re watching their father die alone. I think more than anything they probably just wanted you there for themselves. Which as someone so incredibly close to my mother, I kinda can\u2019t blame them for that if it\u2019s the case. Sometimes in the worse moments, we can genuinely just turn into little kids who want our mom. And the other parent dying, a death they haven\u2019t experienced yet and don\u2019t know how to handle (none of us do the first time around) is probably a moment where your adult kids were like \u201cfuck I want my mom right now\u201d \n\nFood for thought.", "NTA, and he won't be alone. He will all his children by his side.", "He has 3 adult children, and grandchildren. They can be with him. If you don't want to get back into all of that, then don't. When you're under less pressure and stress you can support your kids better. They are losing their dad.   \nYou already lost him, over and over while he was cheating on you. Then you lost him for good in the divorce. You've already grieved it, and put it behind you.   \n\n\nMaybe if you try to explain it like that to the kids, they will be more understanding.   \n\n\nRegardless of what you choose to do, you're NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe could have the love of his life sitting with him, but he decided to cheat on her with younger women instead.\n\nYou are handling this very well OP. Personally, I'd have told him to call his favorite affair partner.", "NTA\n\n>He said he was afraid to die alone and had always hoped he\u2019d be next to me as he went.\n\nIf that's what he wanted then maybe he shouldn't have cheated. I'm sorry he's dying, but being on your deathbed doesn't mean you are owed forgiveness for your actions in life. Sometimes people have just caused too much hurt to be able to undo it.", "NTA, if he wanted to die with you beside him he shouldn't have cheated on you (multiple times!). Also, while it sucks when someone is dying, death is not a get out of jail free card so to speak. If someone has betrayed you, hurt you, broken off contact with you etc. they don't suddenly get to say that you have to forgive them now because they are dying.", "N T A. Your ex was selfish in life and is still selfish in death.    \nComfort a cheating asshole? Nope. You own this man nothing. Why would you carry the burden of sitting with him when he dies? He is not your family.  Your children need back off and respect your decision.", "NAH\n\na dying man is regretting his life\u2019s choices.  Your children are grieving and want you to support them.  You  do not want to reopen old wounds and subject yourself to emotional blackmail.\n\nwhen all is said and done, you and your kids will still be here and whatever you do now will have a lasting impact on your relationship with them.", "If you divorce then date, depending on the circumstances, you might even remain on good terms with your ex, and it wouldn't hurt the kids as much (assuming you have any). It would be best for everyone involved. So why do people cheat? And why do they often act as if they were the ones betrayed when caught? Adding on to that, why do they often blame their partner? I don't get it.", "Its not unfortunate at all.  She's showing her true colors to her kids, and you're damn right there will be repercussions. As there should be. That is their father. He is dying in a hospital. If he can be served divorce papers, lose his family, and pay the price for cheating. She can pay the price for being a cold hearted B. What she is suggesting is WAY worse than infidelity. And it isn't something her kids can or should forgive. Absolutely horrific.", "I can't imagine ever speaking to my mom or dad again if they pulled some shit like this. I mean seriously, this is way beyond infidelity. Way beyond. That man is literally laying in a hospital bed, dying. No one is asking her to forgive him, or get married again, or anything like that. But have some basic human compassion for a man you had three children with, and were married to, and spent the better part of your adult life with hand in hand. The guy is fucking dying.  Her kids will never forgive her for this, nor should they.", "That their parents are divorced because their father cheated?", "If he's dying of cancer, I'm afraid it's more like collext debt.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I\u2019m 24 years old, but when my uncle died, who was sometimes more of a father than my own could be, I was distraught. I barely remember anything about those two weeks between his death and the funeral, but I do remember being at my aunts house and I was supposed to be staying there with her so she wasn\u2019t alone, and my mom was getting ready to leave and I had an absolute panic attack, or something close. I couldn\u2019t stop hyperventilating and sobbing, I almost made myself pass out. My mother was going to *leave*, and something inside me could not let her leave without me I needed my mom with me then, I turned into a 6 year old kid crying for my mom out of grief. It really does things to you.", "You can tell him to call all those women he cheated on you with to come and comfort him. He apparently preferred them over you.", "If he was scared of dying alone, why would he cheat on his wife? Nta. Kids are just distraught their dad is dying.", "If he wanted to see you and have you there as he passed maybe he shouldn't have had a string of affairs. Once again he's doing what he wants and your kids are upset because their father is dying, and while he's their father, he's your cheating ex. A man who repeatedly disrespected you and showed he didn't care about you or your feelings.\n\nValidate their fear and grief, but simply state after years of disrespect you no longer have any obligations to the man who imploded your life.", "Ope. He's still refusing to reap what he sowed.\n\nLook, I know you don't want to give him a dang thing. But you have to face relationships with your kids for the rest of your life. For their sake alone, could you face one more visit with him? It might go a long way towards avoiding a lifelong resentment if you took pity on him for a short visit.\n\nI would be busy making it real clear to him and your kids that you aren't going to be sitting beside him for weeks and that they are very welcome to.", "NTA. But...\n.wouldn't you be going mostly for your kids? To love & support them during this difficult time?  Your ex was not a good person, but it's not for him. It's for your kids.", "Well it ain't fucking easy.", "Showing her true colors? Are you seriously blaming the victim? Calling her a cold-hearted bitch? She already \u201cpaid her price.\u201d", "She was one of the first to be told about my health situation (by my current spouse). She has been nothing but kind and supportive from 1000 miles away. \n\nOur relationship improved dramatically once she felt free to look for someone more suitable than me.", "This. My grandpa was dying from cancer. My dads dad. My mom hadn\u2019t been with him since I was about 3, I was 16 when he died\u2026. But my mom didn\u2019t go to an doctors appts or see him in the room unless he himself asked for her. They had a good relationship but he knew how my dad was too her.

I respect your stance but for the sake of being present as your children's father dies, it may be unexpectedly bonding for OP & ythe kids. Nothing changes the fact he was a scuzzo.

People who survive SA are victims. People who have been robbed, beaten, thrown out into the street by those in power are victims. Stop slapping real victims in the face with your wannbe victim bs.
