It's not like he's gonna die alone, he's just trying to absolve his guilt... F that. NTA.\n\nI do however wonder if part of the issue here is that because your husband cheated on you multiple times before you left, your kids have normalized cheating as just \"something that happens\" that isn't the huge betrayal most of the world sees it as.", "NTA. If he wanted you there at his deathbed, then he shouldn\u2019t have made the choice that he did. I can understand your children\u2019s frustration, but that doesn\u2019t give them any right to be distant from you or angry. \nI think what you are doing is brave and strong. I\u2019m sure you have had to do a lot of healing to even be at this point right now, to not bend over and give him his last wish, when all you wanted was a lasting marriage. Kudos to you. If I could I would shake your hand. \nBig hugs as I know this cannot be easy. But as humans we have to learn how to live life, to forgive but that never means you have to forget. I think you can send him some flowers or a nice card, but honestly, he doesn\u2019t deserve much more. \n\nEven better, make him a meal he can enjoy with his children. But I would not give him the honor of your presence. That is simply my opinion. Wish him well, but from a distance.. ya know?", "NTA. You took a vow \"til death do us part\" and he broke it many times over and so now he's got to face death solo.  It's as simple as that.", "NTA. He literally f%cked around and now he\u2019s finding out", "NTA he does not get to cheat and keep your support during the hard times.", "NTA - I think it was okay if him to ask.  But its also okay to decline. Its too bad the kids don't accept your choice though.", "NTA. His actions where the reason your two lives got separated. You no longer have any obligation to be around for his death. \n\nI'd go there anyway. Not to sit with him while he's dying, but to see him one last time. He's probably remorseful, maybe wants to get some things off his chest. Imminent death makes people reconsider things, and I'd be curious to hear what he's got to say. \n\nHis children can keep him company at the end.", "NTA. If he had remembered that \"I want you beside me when I die,\" thing **before** he cheated, things might be different. If you can't handle trying yet again to take care of him when he couldn't respect you, don't go. No one gets to tell you how to grieve, and your kids may not 'get' that you're likely still grieving your marriage, not just the end of his life. You may grieve for the negatives he added to your life for the rest of your own life, and that's understandable. Put short, you don't owe anybody anything and leaving your kids at the center of the circle in this trauma is totally fine. Support them, not the ex, if you can.", "You are NTA (i assume you're not stopping your kids from seeing him).\n\nYou are not obligated to do emotional labour to support your ex.", "NTA - but I wonder if your kids need you there more. To be with them during this time.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t go either if I were in your spot.", "NTA. He's not going to die alone, he has his children.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think this is fair to answer.   This comes down to how you feel.  It\u2019s not cut and dry.", "NTA if you choose not to go, but if going is not completely awful to you then you should probably consider it. He cheated and he's been out of your life for some time but you were obviously a huge part of each others lives, and most importantly it means a lot for your kids. If I was in your situation I'd go at least once, even if just to let him say what he wants to say. At the same time, if you have too many bad memories to go back then it's perfectly fine to stay away.", "His children need to go be with him/ they are AHs. \nHe can\u2019t expect his ex wife, who he treated poorly, to be at his bedside.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s asking you to come in hopes of clearing his conscious before he dies. It\u2019s very common for people who cheated, abused, etc. to do so.", "He's dying, you obviously mean/meant something to him and vice versa. I don't think anyone should judge you either way but part of me thinks you will regret not seeing him in his final days - heck he might say something to regret going as well. Your kids probably want to see you there too and if you don't do it for yourself or him, maybe for them - this is kinda weak sounding but it's the best I got.\n\nYANTA whatever you choose imho.\n\nWould hate to be in your shoes right now.", "YWNBTA for not going to see him\n\nYou divorced a long time ago because he had no respect for you by cheating on you.\n\nHe has his Children.", "YTA. You knew you weren\u2019t going to go, why didn\u2019t you just tell him straight up?", "NTA. He cheated on you but he's not cheating death. He may not deserve your presence but do be sure that decision is one you can live with in the long term.", "NTA - just let him die alone.", "Your story is pretty similar to my parents except my father isn\u2019t dying.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t expect my mom to be at my dad\u2019s deathbed. They aren\u2019t married anymore, she\u2019s not part of his family unit. Just us kids. \n\nNTA. You don\u2019t owe him your presence. How he envisions his passing is not your responsibility anymore. \n\nI am sorry that everyone is dealing with this through.", "NTA. It's up to you whether you feel you need to go or not but explain to your kids that he isn't your family anymore but theirs. That his bond to you ended years ago.", "Immature and petty for not wanting to see the person who cheated on you multiple times??? No, NTA. They should have more empathy.", "NTA for not going as you have no obligation, but be aware this could affect the relationship with your children. And you should have just told him no from the start if you had no intention.", "NTA\nWhere's his younger woman now? Where are the women he slept with while he was supposed to be your loving husband? Always imagined he would die with you by his side... Because he thought he could treat you like shit and walk all over you and you would let him. Don't worship at thia mans feet,  juat because he ia dying doesn't mean he deserves your time. He only wants you now because nobody else wants him. Tell the kids you aren't going but there's nothing stopping them from looking after him. The kids didn't have the same betrayal and devastation when the marriage broke up so they won't understand how you feel.  It would be worth contacting your ex and telling him you won't be coming to see him so that he doesn't kewp bothering the kids about it.  He was very selfiah to ask,  but his selfishness ia obviously nothing new.", "I have little sympathy for anyone who cheats \u2026.\nBut here is a story for you that involves another scenario where someone hurt me and wanted a chance to talk .\nA woman got  high and early on a Sat morning drove her car into my fence .A piece of fence fractured my dog\u2019s  hip .We were out shopping .Neighbors called us home .The woman kept sending a message asking to talk and see my dog .I\u2019d recently been in a MVA,had my own fractures and was now trying to do PT with my dog .I kept turning her down .That lady killed  herself.\nYour ex.is already dying .You do not know what he wants to say.You do not owe him anything and you WNBTA  if you continue to decline .I regret horribly not giving that lady a chance to talk to me .Her suicide was not my fault .Her wife was already leaving her and taking her daughter .Apparently because of her drug use .She already had plenty in life to be depressed about .But it will always be a big regret in my life that I did  not give her a chance to talk to me and say whatever she wanted to say.OP ,only you can decide if the pain he caused is too great to ever give him what he wants .If you do go \u2014do it for your future self .", "No judgement from me and no easy answer so a very conservative NAH.\n\nThis is a very personal matter so I'm offering a very personal opinion.\n\nHe's not asking for absolution, is he? He's asking for an act of compassion. I'm saying this as someone slightly younger who will probably follow him soon enough. I would not ask something like this of someone I did not trust with my soul. My ex from 20 years ago would be one of them because, even though I don't think that I ever treated her well enough,  I have that much faith in that person.", "NTA but why aren't your kids visiting?", "NTA. He has three children who can be with him. They don't seem to think cheating is very important, but I think that reflects badly on them, not you.", "NTA but hear me out: courthouse wedding before he kicks the bucket, collect benefits.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation whatsoever to this man. He broke your trust & ruined your marriage. Just because he\u2019s dying doesn\u2019t mean you have to subject yourself to being around him. He\u2019s also likely using your kids to try to manipulate you into seeing him.
