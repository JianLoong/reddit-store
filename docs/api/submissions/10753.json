I think he's an entitled brat who has gotten away with crap far too many times. I don't think Diana has ever reprimanded him, and every time the little shit acts up Diana makes excuses for him. He's already been suspended from school for stealing, he's a bully to all his cousins, and I know for a fact no one in my family likes him at all. Both of my parents cannot stand him. My mother, a woman who could find the love in her heart to babysit a honey badger, refuses to watch Darius at all because of his behavior. My father will take all of the grandkids out to fish every few months, except for Darius because he's to tempted to throw him out into the lake and drive off (his words not mine.)\n\nOn Monday, I got a call from my sister who panicked because she got called into work. Darius was out of school and her babysitter was not available. No one else in the family will watch Darius so I told her to drop him off and I would watch him. It was a nightmare. Darius was mad he had to spend his day off at my place. He refused to do anything I offered, made a mess in my bathroom, harassed my dog, and had a tantrum because I would not let him use my work computer to play games.\n\nBy lunchtime, I was frustrated beyond all belief. I made him mac and cheese and he demanded I take him to wendy's. He refused to eat and eventually dumped his bowl of food on my floor. At that, I just kinda lost it. I didn't yell or get aggressive at all. I just  sighed and asked him if he realized that everyone in the family literally despised him. I explained that he was at my house because grandma and grandpa cannot stand him, and in fact refuse to let him come to their house because he acts like a little shit. I won't lie, I got pretty brutal.\n\nHe started crying and locked himself in my bathroom until he came out and sat and watched tv till my sister came and got him. I told her what happened and I and her got into a massive argument as well. She called me cruel and I told her that she's to blame and he would have learned eventually.\n\nMy family is split on this. My dad thinks \"the little shit deserved it\" while my siblings have mixed opinions. My mother has told me she's staying out of this but if I feel the need to apologize do it and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nOk, the early consensus is I'm an asshole. That's fine.\n\nA little info. We've talked to Diana about this before. My parents sat her down and told her they will not watch Darius because of how he behaved and that she needs to do something else. We've all had talks with her about him bulling his cousins. She has done nothing.", "created_utc": 1677193097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11abh83/aita_for_telling_my_nephew_the_truth_that_no_one/", "score": 1412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA\n\nHe's 10, not 4. He's old enough to hear harsh truths about **his own actions.** If he's acting like a little shit, he needs to be TOLD he's acting like a little shit. \n\nSorry he got his feelings hurt, but when it's to the point that people would rather not be around him AT ALL, it's gotten to the point where someone OTHER than his mother needs to step in and let him know that this behavior will NOT be tolerated any longer and that unless he changes it, relatives will continue to find ways to avoid him.", "I feel bad for the kid because it probably isn't truly his fault, but you're NTA.\n\nYou gave him hard truth at a young age. \\*Maybe\\*, just maybe, this will be a catalyst for him to realize that he needs to change his behavior.\n\nUltimately though it sounds like your sister is a dogshit parent, and she's setting up her son to be a drain on the rest of society and possibly spend his life in the justice system, based on what you've said.\n\nThe tragic thing about this kind of behavior in a 10 year old is that \"we\" collectively cease putting up with it once you're a legal adult. \"Stealing\" as a 10 year old is just a behavior that needs correcting. Stealing as an adult means you go to jail, or worse. Nobody in that system will give two shits that his mother didn't bother to parent him.", "NTA. It is a truth and probably the wake-up call the kid needs as well as your sister. Parents need to start parenting their children and stop sending assholes out into the world.", "Not to endorse the way OP went about things, but I do think other commenters have a point that if mom isn't willing to reign a shitty kid in then having a family member give a reality check isn't the worst thing. It's a bit difficult to ask OP for more info after they've already stated the whole family hates this kid, I'm generally inclined to believe the kid is a little shit who needs checked if nobody is willing to even pick them up and watch them for one day. \n\nAll that said, OP should consider if this was a constructive way of getting the point across or just a satisfying way of 'putting the kid in their place'. A 10 y/o being an AH isn't a license for a 25 y/o to be an AH in return. I'm settling for ESH just because IMO 10 is old enough to know better, especially about dumping food on the floor but 25 is old enough to know \"just being truthful\" isn't a good excuse for being an AH towards a 10 y/o", "NTA. You fought fire with fire. Some kids do well with a gentle but firm \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d. I have a feeling Darius would see that as a weakness.

Your sister needs to get the cotton out of her ears and wake up because she's setting your nephew up for failure.", "He's 10. He's been raised badly. He didn't just wake up one day and decide \"You know what, I'm gonna be a total AH to everyone\". This is your sister's failure, and as much he is a total little sh\\*t, it's not entirely his fault. Because he's 10 and he's never been taught better. \n\nDid he need a serious talking to? Yes. \n\nWas your way the right way to do it? Not really. \n\nIt's better to talk about behaviour and outcomes than make it about the kid. Instead of telling him that his *actions* caused people in the family to not want to be around him (which I would applaud), you told him that his grandparents loathe *him, himself.*\n\nIt's not very effective, because it doesn't give him anything to change. Behaviours can be changed, but if you tell a kid that everyone hates them, that's them as a whole, not something they can change.\n\nIt's not like telling an AH adult that everyone dislikes them cos they're an AH. An adult can figure out what that means and deal with it. But a kid? Their family is their whole world and all the people they rely on, and you told him that basically everyone in his world loathes his very being.\n\nThat's what makes it cruel.\n\nI really don't want to call you an AH, cos I'm not sure I would have lasted even til lunchtime with that little sh\\*t!

He NEEDS to know that his behavior is already costing him relationships and will continue to cost him relationships until he chooses to not act this way. \n\nSometimes the truth is hard to hear, but when the truth is all that's left, that's what you've got to do. Sugar coating it would not have gotten the point across and avoiding it sure wasn't, either.  The pain and rejection be feels will - hopefully - be a huge wake up call.

Childhood is when children learn how to be humans, which is an uncomfortable and difficult process at the best of times. His mom has avoided this process altogether.

Someone needed to tell him sooner or later that his behavior wasn't going to garner him any friends and clearly, it wasn't going to be your sister. And for people who think that you were too harsh, I'd seriously beg them to consider how empathetic you'd be feeling towards a miniature demon that you don't have a good relationship with who just dumped food on the floor, made a mess and threw a tantrum in your house. The reality check was coming to him some way and somehow one way or another, and based on your description of him, Darius actually got off pretty lucky.

However, I totally would have done the same thing. Say it how it is. He\u2019s 10, not 2.

But this consequence is a fact.", "NTA. Darius apparently behaved after you told him some hard truths, so you should have no guilt about what you did.

Maybe this will serve as a wake-up call to Darius about his behavior.\n\nDon't apologize.

It's cruel to say that to the kid, at the same time it's the truth that probably didn't need to be said, despite how cathartic. \n\nThe child does need to be reprimanded, because he's a bad child and that's why he and his mother don't get a pass, especially the mother. He's still a child and he didn't raise himself. \n\nWhy I feel for you is because my brother went through something similar. He called his nephew the spawn of Satan. He would tell the kid he was the devil incarnate. His wife (bio aunt) was pissed because the kid is only 6. At the same time, he did things that made me believe he would be a serial killer one day. \n\nWhile I told my brother and sister in law, he needs parenting because his behavior is beyond worrisome, nothing was done because the focus was on how mean my brother was. Eventually the nephew went back to his home. A few months after his return, we learned he burned his mother's house down and she got hurt in the fire, we haven't heard an update since. He should be 7 by now.  My brother also refused to allow him back in their house.  I have no idea if the child got the help he needed.  His name is a sore subject, so I can't even broach the subject anymore.\n\nIn all, your reaction overwrote any influence you may have had with your sister. Now, you're just the mean guy making kids cry. Hopefully, she learns to do better sooner rather than later.  \n\nIn the end, you should apologize for not handling the situation with the best care and set a boundary such as, he's not allowed in my home again.

Apologize to your nephew if you can and then explain what you meant to address was his behavior NOT HIM.

Try and give him a safe space to say why he acts the way he does? I think the words you said make it ESH because you took it too far.

I think he's an entitled brat who has gotten away with crap far too many times. I don't think Diana has ever reprimanded him, and every time the little shit acts up Diana makes excuses for him. He's already been suspended from school for stealing, he's a bully to all his cousins, and I know for a fact no one in my family likes him at all. Both of my parents cannot stand him. My mother, a woman who could find the love in her heart to babysit a honey badger, refuses to watch Darius at all because of his behavior. My father will take all of the grandkids out to fish every few months, except for Darius because he's to tempted to throw him out into the lake and drive off (his words not mine.)  \n\n\nOn Monday, I got a call from my sister who panicked because she got called into work. Darius was out of school and her babysitter was not available. No one else in the family will watch Darius so I told her to drop him off and I would watch him. It was a nightmare. Darius was mad he had to spend his day off at my place. He refused to do anything I offered, made a mess in my bathroom, harassed my dog, and had a tantrum because I would not let him use my work computer to play games. \n\nBy lunchtime, I was frustrated beyond all belief. I made him mac and cheese and he demanded I take him to wendy's. He refused to eat and eventually dumped his bowl of food on my floor. At that, I just kinda lost it. I didn't yell or get aggressive at all. I just signed and asked him if he realized that everyone in the family literally despised him. I explained that he was at my house because grandma and grandpa cannot stand him, and in fact refuse to let him come to their house because he acts like a little shit. I won't lie, I got pretty brutal.\n\nHe started crying and locked himself in my bathroom until he came out and sat and watched tv till my sister came and got him. I told her what happened and I and her got into a massive argument as well. She called me cruel and I told her that she's to blame and he would have learned eventually.\n\nMy family is split on this. My dad thinks \"the little shit deserved it\" while my siblings have mixed opinions. My mother has told me she's staying out of this but if I feel the need to apologize do it and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why shouldn\u2019t he know he\u2019s being a little shit? At least now he realizes it and he can work on himself instead of letting his mom enable bad behavior", "NTA \n\nWhy would OP apologize?

I've met far too many kids like this that should've been told what said to him a long time ago. And 10 is NOT too young to hear it. It's not like he's 3. You're also young enough for him to view you more a big brother than the uncle you are and what you said is 100% the reality check from a big brother he needed to hear. It's not like his own dad said this stuff to him or your sister who's his mom.  If your sister didn't like it, she should start acting like a real parent and set boundaries for her child. Kids like him grow up to be awful adults and the sooner they get a reality check the better it is for literally everyone that will interact with him going forward.", "NTA I think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable and good to be blunt with kids.

That's not cool.", "Any kid that dumps a bowl of food on the floor is an asshole. I cannot imagine ever behaving like that. NTA , he should be exposed to reality.", "Esh.  Even if it was a true statement that is still a child. I don't like children and I wouldn't have been so blunt with him.

Telling him everyone hates him makes everything worse. \nI read the update where you said everyone has talked to her and she refuses to correct his behavior. She needs to snap out of it because that kids will continue to grow up into a menace, where the real world will not coddle him the way she is. She is 100% setting him up for failure in life. If she cannot control him, she needs to seek out a therapist because it might be underlying issues that only someone who is certified can help with.

A friend of my ex wife had a kid like this, she treated this kid like as if he were an adult and a buddy.

Mom was furious but no reprimand. Later the next day he had just gotten a brand new Swiss Army knife and he was doing something that I knew he was going to slice the F\u2026 on one of his fingers. I told him I saw what he was doing if you\u2019re going to hurt yourself, which he replied, I know what I\u2019m doing so shut up, this is a 10 year old. So I turned around and said OK not 10 minutes later he does exactly what I thought he was going to do slice the hell out of his finger I was running screaming to mom and I just walked by and said I told you so.

He does need to learn his actions will impact his relationships with other people, and you definitely got that point across\u2026but he also needs to learn that family is there for you, to steer you in the right direction so he grows up to not be the kind of person that tells a ten year old everyone in their family hates them. \ud83d\ude02", "Yta.

Either way, the kid needs some tough love and probably behavioral and family therapy, but being told the truth about everyone hating him (especially if there truly is a disorder) is not likely to be helpful.", "Yeah, I mean I remember being 10 and I feel like I was pretty well grounded and aware of my peers and was aware when I did an asshole thing. This is a 5th grader, not a kindergartener. I mean sure OP probably could've gone about it better but it's ESH at worst as far as OP is concerned. I can totally understand having tried multiple avenues to correct it and finally reaching your breaking point and unloading. The ultimate asshole in this story is the sister that has only made excuses for him and never corrected the behavior.", "I agree, that's why I edited to clarify that telling a child people hate him is wrong. However, OP is not a parent and is young. Many of us who are commenting are speaking from a place of either abusive households or our own parenting knowledge. OP spoke in anger and at a level that a child cannot contextualise. The words were wrong but the intervention was not.", "The issue isn\u2019t that OP said something the issue is that what was said was far too harsh given the kids age and circumstances and not at all constructive. \n\nalso everyone knows it\u2019s harmful to tell kids\n\u2018they hate you vs they have your behaviour\u2019  especially when OP essentially sat the kid down for a \u2018your entire family hates you\u2019 rant.", "The kid was told his entire family can't stand his existence. Different.", "Hell, dogs remember if the reinforcement takes place soon enough after their behaviors\u2026", "Yeah, I mean cmon like he\u2019s bullying people, he can\u2019t be that clueless, people here are acting like he\u2019s 1, he\u2019s double digits, he knows, he just doesn\u2019t care bcuz he\u2019s never anyone call him out on his behavior. Some people will do horrible things if they can get away with it and no one calls them out. OP could\u2019ve phrased it better but I just say a minor YTA. This enabling imo is preposterous and so unhelpful.", "Old habits die hard. Real change is going to take real effort from everyone involved. Especially Darius. I think they all need to get on the same page. And fast.", "That\u2019s quite honestly impressive for 10 and not at all developmentally expected. \n\nNo one is saying this kid is blameless. \n\nI\u2019m saying he deserves consequences but the vitriol he received is best directed at the adult who is failing him. I\u2019m sorry you feel a 10 year old should be expected to learn self regulation with zero guidance, and it\u2019s impressive that you had that ability. That does not apply to everyone.", "\"Your behavior makes it hard to be around you so you aren't invited to as many things as the other kids in the family. Everyone hates the way you behave and don't like being around you because of it\"", "Extension-fox didn't say this is something they'd do as a professional. Their knowledge and training gives them the tools to handle such a Come-To-Jesus moment better (focusing on actions and behaviors). A family at the end of their rope with the kid? It's understandable. Far better than screaming and swearing at the kid.", "\nExactly it\u2019s absolutely insane how many people in this comments section think it is in any way appropriate to go on a long rant to a child about how their entire family hates them. \n\nThe fact that people like the one you are replying too also think it\u2019s enabling the kid to tell it\u2019s their behaviour that is the issue rather than going for a personal attack is wild. Like if anything being clear about what the issue is makes it far more likely to produce positive results instead of just fucking up the kids self esteem.", "But it\u2019s not ok to tell a kid \u201cpeople don\u2019t like you\u201d", ":) Thanks. Thankfully that phase didn't last too long. I hope you've been able to relax, and live live life your own way. Perfectionism is a bitch.", "I didn't say op helped, just that the kid probably isn't a moron and can tell he's acting differently", "I can't imagine how many times you'd have to fuck up hard-core at school to get suspended by age 10.\n\nI think it sucks that OP had to do it, but I don't think darius' mom is going to ever correct his behavior, and all of the other adults being moderately less direct haven't helped him yet", "Yes....... it is. You can say, \"people don't like you because you do x and y\"", "That's an excellent point. I don't remember anyone I went to grade school with getting suspended by that age. The only kid that ever got suspended the entire time I was in grade school was one kid that hit a teacher (eventually expelled) and another kid whose hit list they found (also expelled).", "Yeah, I used intervention in the loosest sense. He's 10, I wasn't thinking of a movie style intervention.  \n   \nIt honestly sounds like even if the family had talked to the  kids mother, no one had ever explained to the kid the consequences of his actions, and his mother obviously wasn't doing it.   \n   \nI wouldn't be surprised if she was actively telling him lies about why he didn't go on the trips or visit people's houses.", "To get suspended by 3rd grade means you've gone through so many layers of the school trying to correct your behavior they've given up", "Yelling/snapping at children makes their behavior worse and enables them, one reason being they are typically acting out in the first place to get attention, because they\u2019ve been \u201crewarded\u201d by it. Talking calmly to a child can do wonders over snapping/reacting, and adding in the entire family hates you at such an impressionable age can lead to fearful avoidant attachment, knowing their family protects them but also feeling inferior/hated to them. OP is 10 fold the AH here", "I'm going with OPs statements that they didn't yell etc.   \n   \nI think it was done poorly, which I said, but I'm curious if the kid had ever heard anything like it before.", "I hope this is the only instance in this kid\u2019s entire life that he has to hear that his entire family despised him."]}
