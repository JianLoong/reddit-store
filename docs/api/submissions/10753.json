I think he's an entitled brat who has gotten away with crap far too many times. I don't think Diana has ever reprimanded him, and every time the little shit acts up Diana makes excuses for him. He's already been suspended from school for stealing, he's a bully to all his cousins, and I know for a fact no one in my family likes him at all. Both of my parents cannot stand him. My mother, a woman who could find the love in her heart to babysit a honey badger, refuses to watch Darius at all because of his behavior. My father will take all of the grandkids out to fish every few months, except for Darius because he's to tempted to throw him out into the lake and drive off (his words not mine.)\n\nOn Monday, I got a call from my sister who panicked because she got called into work. Darius was out of school and her babysitter was not available. No one else in the family will watch Darius so I told her to drop him off and I would watch him. It was a nightmare. Darius was mad he had to spend his day off at my place. He refused to do anything I offered, made a mess in my bathroom, harassed my dog, and had a tantrum because I would not let him use my work computer to play games.\n\nBy lunchtime, I was frustrated beyond all belief. I made him mac and cheese and he demanded I take him to wendy's. He refused to eat and eventually dumped his bowl of food on my floor. At that, I just kinda lost it. I didn't yell or get aggressive at all. I just  sighed and asked him if he realized that everyone in the family literally despised him. I explained that he was at my house because grandma and grandpa cannot stand him, and in fact refuse to let him come to their house because he acts like a little shit. I won't lie, I got pretty brutal.\n\nHe started crying and locked himself in my bathroom until he came out and sat and watched tv till my sister came and got him. I told her what happened and I and her got into a massive argument as well. She called me cruel and I told her that she's to blame and he would have learned eventually.\n\nMy family is split on this. My dad thinks \"the little shit deserved it\" while my siblings have mixed opinions. My mother has told me she's staying out of this but if I feel the need to apologize do it and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nOk, the early consensus is I'm an asshole. That's fine.\n\nA little info. We've talked to Diana about this before. My parents sat her down and told her they will not watch Darius because of how he behaved and that she needs to do something else. We've all had talks with her about him bulling his cousins. She has done nothing.", "created_utc": 1677193097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11abh83/aita_for_telling_my_nephew_the_truth_that_no_one/", "score": 5704, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA\n\nHe's 10, not 4. He's old enough to hear harsh truths about **his own actions.** If he's acting like a little shit, he needs to be TOLD he's acting like a little shit. \n\nSorry he got his feelings hurt, but when it's to the point that people would rather not be around him AT ALL, it's gotten to the point where someone OTHER than his mother needs to step in and let him know that this behavior will NOT be tolerated any longer and that unless he changes it, relatives will continue to find ways to avoid him.", "I feel bad for the kid because it probably isn't truly his fault, but you're NTA.\n\nYou gave him hard truth at a young age. \\*Maybe\\*, just maybe, this will be a catalyst for him to realize that he needs to change his behavior.\n\nUltimately though it sounds like your sister is a dogshit parent, and she's setting up her son to be a drain on the rest of society and possibly spend his life in the justice system, based on what you've said.\n\nThe tragic thing about this kind of behavior in a 10 year old is that \"we\" collectively cease putting up with it once you're a legal adult. \"Stealing\" as a 10 year old is just a behavior that needs correcting. Stealing as an adult means you go to jail, or worse. Nobody in that system will give two shits that his mother didn't bother to parent him.", "NTA. It is a truth and probably the wake-up call the kid needs as well as your sister. Parents need to start parenting their children and stop sending assholes out into the world.", "Not to endorse the way OP went about things, but I do think other commenters have a point that if mom isn't willing to reign a shitty kid in then having a family member give a reality check isn't the worst thing. It's a bit difficult to ask OP for more info after they've already stated the whole family hates this kid, I'm generally inclined to believe the kid is a little shit who needs checked if nobody is willing to even pick them up and watch them for one day. \n\nAll that said, OP should consider if this was a constructive way of getting the point across or just a satisfying way of 'putting the kid in their place'. A 10 y/o being an AH isn't a license for a 25 y/o to be an AH in return. I'm settling for ESH just because IMO 10 is old enough to know better, especially about dumping food on the floor but 25 is old enough to know \"just being truthful\" isn't a good excuse for being an AH towards a 10 y/o", "NTA. You fought fire with fire. Some kids do well with a gentle but firm \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d. I have a feeling Darius would see that as a weakness.

Your sister needs to get the cotton out of her ears and wake up because she's setting your nephew up for failure.", "He's 10. He's been raised badly. He didn't just wake up one day and decide \"You know what, I'm gonna be a total AH to everyone\". This is your sister's failure, and as much he is a total little sh\\*t, it's not entirely his fault. Because he's 10 and he's never been taught better. \n\nDid he need a serious talking to? Yes. \n\nWas your way the right way to do it? Not really. \n\nIt's better to talk about behaviour and outcomes than make it about the kid. Instead of telling him that his *actions* caused people in the family to not want to be around him (which I would applaud), you told him that his grandparents loathe *him, himself.*\n\nIt's not very effective, because it doesn't give him anything to change. Behaviours can be changed, but if you tell a kid that everyone hates them, that's them as a whole, not something they can change.\n\nIt's not like telling an AH adult that everyone dislikes them cos they're an AH. An adult can figure out what that means and deal with it. But a kid? Their family is their whole world and all the people they rely on, and you told him that basically everyone in his world loathes his very being.\n\nThat's what makes it cruel.\n\nI really don't want to call you an AH, cos I'm not sure I would have lasted even til lunchtime with that little sh\\*t!

He NEEDS to know that his behavior is already costing him relationships and will continue to cost him relationships until he chooses to not act this way. \n\nSometimes the truth is hard to hear, but when the truth is all that's left, that's what you've got to do. Sugar coating it would not have gotten the point across and avoiding it sure wasn't, either.  The pain and rejection be feels will - hopefully - be a huge wake up call.

Childhood is when children learn how to be humans, which is an uncomfortable and difficult process at the best of times. His mom has avoided this process altogether.

Someone needed to tell him sooner or later that his behavior wasn't going to garner him any friends and clearly, it wasn't going to be your sister. And for people who think that you were too harsh, I'd seriously beg them to consider how empathetic you'd be feeling towards a miniature demon that you don't have a good relationship with who just dumped food on the floor, made a mess and threw a tantrum in your house. The reality check was coming to him some way and somehow one way or another, and based on your description of him, Darius actually got off pretty lucky.

However, I totally would have done the same thing. Say it how it is. He\u2019s 10, not 2.

But this consequence is a fact.", "NTA. Darius apparently behaved after you told him some hard truths, so you should have no guilt about what you did.

Maybe this will serve as a wake-up call to Darius about his behavior.\n\nDon't apologize.

It's cruel to say that to the kid, at the same time it's the truth that probably didn't need to be said, despite how cathartic. \n\nThe child does need to be reprimanded, because he's a bad child and that's why he and his mother don't get a pass, especially the mother. He's still a child and he didn't raise himself. \n\nWhy I feel for you is because my brother went through something similar. He called his nephew the spawn of Satan. He would tell the kid he was the devil incarnate. His wife (bio aunt) was pissed because the kid is only 6. At the same time, he did things that made me believe he would be a serial killer one day. \n\nWhile I told my brother and sister in law, he needs parenting because his behavior is beyond worrisome, nothing was done because the focus was on how mean my brother was. Eventually the nephew went back to his home. A few months after his return, we learned he burned his mother's house down and she got hurt in the fire, we haven't heard an update since. He should be 7 by now.  My brother also refused to allow him back in their house.  I have no idea if the child got the help he needed.  His name is a sore subject, so I can't even broach the subject anymore.\n\nIn all, your reaction overwrote any influence you may have had with your sister. Now, you're just the mean guy making kids cry. Hopefully, she learns to do better sooner rather than later.  \n\nIn the end, you should apologize for not handling the situation with the best care and set a boundary such as, he's not allowed in my home again.

Apologize to your nephew if you can and then explain what you meant to address was his behavior NOT HIM.

Try and give him a safe space to say why he acts the way he does? I think the words you said make it ESH because you took it too far.

I think he's an entitled brat who has gotten away with crap far too many times. I don't think Diana has ever reprimanded him, and every time the little shit acts up Diana makes excuses for him. He's already been suspended from school for stealing, he's a bully to all his cousins, and I know for a fact no one in my family likes him at all. Both of my parents cannot stand him. My mother, a woman who could find the love in her heart to babysit a honey badger, refuses to watch Darius at all because of his behavior. My father will take all of the grandkids out to fish every few months, except for Darius because he's to tempted to throw him out into the lake and drive off (his words not mine.)  \n\n\nOn Monday, I got a call from my sister who panicked because she got called into work. Darius was out of school and her babysitter was not available. No one else in the family will watch Darius so I told her to drop him off and I would watch him. It was a nightmare. Darius was mad he had to spend his day off at my place. He refused to do anything I offered, made a mess in my bathroom, harassed my dog, and had a tantrum because I would not let him use my work computer to play games. \n\nBy lunchtime, I was frustrated beyond all belief. I made him mac and cheese and he demanded I take him to wendy's. He refused to eat and eventually dumped his bowl of food on my floor. At that, I just kinda lost it. I didn't yell or get aggressive at all. I just signed and asked him if he realized that everyone in the family literally despised him. I explained that he was at my house because grandma and grandpa cannot stand him, and in fact refuse to let him come to their house because he acts like a little shit. I won't lie, I got pretty brutal.\n\nHe started crying and locked himself in my bathroom until he came out and sat and watched tv till my sister came and got him. I told her what happened and I and her got into a massive argument as well. She called me cruel and I told her that she's to blame and he would have learned eventually.\n\nMy family is split on this. My dad thinks \"the little shit deserved it\" while my siblings have mixed opinions. My mother has told me she's staying out of this but if I feel the need to apologize do it and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why shouldn\u2019t he know he\u2019s being a little shit? At least now he realizes it and he can work on himself instead of letting his mom enable bad behavior", "NTA \n\nWhy would OP apologize?

I've met far too many kids like this that should've been told what said to him a long time ago. And 10 is NOT too young to hear it. It's not like he's 3. You're also young enough for him to view you more a big brother than the uncle you are and what you said is 100% the reality check from a big brother he needed to hear. It's not like his own dad said this stuff to him or your sister who's his mom.  If your sister didn't like it, she should start acting like a real parent and set boundaries for her child. Kids like him grow up to be awful adults and the sooner they get a reality check the better it is for literally everyone that will interact with him going forward.", "NTA I think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable and good to be blunt with kids.

That's not cool.", "Any kid that dumps a bowl of food on the floor is an asshole. I cannot imagine ever behaving like that. NTA , he should be exposed to reality.", "Esh.  Even if it was a true statement that is still a child. I don't like children and I wouldn't have been so blunt with him.

Telling him everyone hates him makes everything worse. \nI read the update where you said everyone has talked to her and she refuses to correct his behavior. She needs to snap out of it because that kids will continue to grow up into a menace, where the real world will not coddle him the way she is. She is 100% setting him up for failure in life. If she cannot control him, she needs to seek out a therapist because it might be underlying issues that only someone who is certified can help with.

A friend of my ex wife had a kid like this, she treated this kid like as if he were an adult and a buddy.

Mom was furious but no reprimand. Later the next day he had just gotten a brand new Swiss Army knife and he was doing something that I knew he was going to slice the F\u2026 on one of his fingers. I told him I saw what he was doing if you\u2019re going to hurt yourself, which he replied, I know what I\u2019m doing so shut up, this is a 10 year old. So I turned around and said OK not 10 minutes later he does exactly what I thought he was going to do slice the hell out of his finger I was running screaming to mom and I just walked by and said I told you so.

He does need to learn his actions will impact his relationships with other people, and you definitely got that point across\u2026but he also needs to learn that family is there for you, to steer you in the right direction so he grows up to not be the kind of person that tells a ten year old everyone in their family hates them. \ud83d\ude02", "Yta.

I can get snapping at an asshole kid after so long, but next time make sure that kid knows the actions that are problematic and make emphasis on their shitty actions being what drives people away, that way the kid doesn't just feel like they're a massive problem but can't figure out how to fix it, or like there's no point in trying to fix it because they're unfixable.

If OP is taking the kid as an emergency and doesn't want to actually try to parent or help the kid, why not try to make the terror kid comfortable for a day and go about your work (i.e. ask the kid what he wants to eat, provide some kind of activity to do). OR you could try to parent the kid and get involved. It seems OP didn't do either.\n\nThe kid wanted Wendy's. You don't always get what you want, but does the kid actually eat Mac and Cheese? My son is a picky eater, but some things that are traditionally \"kid food\" he hates, and some healthy food he loves. Of course Darius throwing it on the floor is bad. Did OP check what the kid likes to eat? Was Wendy's actually a consideration? If the kid is a terror, why make lunch your hill to die on? \n\nThe kid made a mess in the bathroom. Why? How? Did he have trouble going to the bathroom? Was he just playing with water? Did the kid not have activities to do?\n\nKid wanted to use his computer to play games. Did the kid have other games to play? Anything to do? If kids are left alone and bored they're going to find a mess to get into or find something to play with.\n\nLook, the kid obviously has problems and I'm not saying OP did anything wrong, but again OP fully expected this situation when he agreed to look after the kid and it seems like OP treated Darius as if he was a BETTER than average respectful and behaved kid.\n\nIf I had to take the trouble kid, I'd be thinking \"what can this kid eat? Do I have anything he can do to distract him? How much attention do I need to give? Can I leave him alone?\" Maybe I'd fail horribly also. But I can't imagine \"go play by yourself with non-digital devices and no toys, then eat the food I think you like\" is going to go well.\n\nMy point here is what did OP expect to happen in this situation? Everyone knows the kid is a terror. OP seems to have expected to just feed the kid whatever, leave the kid on his own and the kid will just find something quiet and respectful to do. Then OP seems to be absolutely shocked and surprised the kid is acting out. How did OP think this day was going to go?", "Apologizing will validate his behavior.

It's still not acceptable, its just an explanation. The parts of a childs brain responsible for impulse control and critical thinking are still developing. 10 year olds who act out are not criminals. There is a wide range of factors that contribute to this behavior. He had to learn it somewhere. Based on the post it sounds like the kid has a permissive parent and conditional love at best. If he had unconditional love, guidance, consistancy, and some therapy he could learn and grow to have a bright future. Being judgy and labelling this kid \"bad\" when he's acting out because clearly nobody loves him and he has no proper guidance instead of helping him is how to make a future criminal.", "And you think telling a 10 y/o kid who has clearly not been taught emotional regulation or any other life skills that everyone hates him is going to make the behavior better?

The structure must be a LOT more consistent with less tolerance for fault than there would be with other kids.

He\u2019s not ever going to get better if his behavior is not addressed. He has no respect for others, treats everyone like crap, bullies other kids, how bad does it have to get before Dudley gets his comeuppance? Ten years old is not a baby, he\u2019s old enough to know better, he\u2018s old enough to know how to treat others, he\u2019s old enough to learn the awful truth about himself.

A big question I have is why nobody is shaking Diana saying \u201cyou\u2019re raising an entitled menace!!\u201d. OP had a stress induced outburst because he is *not* equipped to spend more than maybe a few hours alone with a kid whose mom won\u2019t say \u201chey don\u2019t act like that\u201d EVER! OP is very clearly aware this behaviour is rooted in Diana missing the mark on a very important aspect of raising a kid. Raising a child with 0 boundaries or social education is a sure fire way to create someone who is genuinely going to have problems making and maintaining friends in the future. Though something like an older relative saying \u201cnobody likes you!\u201d is definitely a core memory for a lot of kids. \u201cNobody likes *you*\u201d is not something you say to a child.\n\nOP is an asshole for going off at a kid when he should have been going off at Diana. Diana is an asshole for raising her kid with 0 interest in teaching him how to behave and socialize. She is without thinking  that\u2019ll put him in situations he won\u2019t be able to navigate in about 4 short years when he\u2019s in highschool and he sees the consequences for his behaviour a lot more clearly.\n\nTL;DR: Diana isn\u2019t catching enough heat. *she* is the asshole. Someone needs to tell her she\u2019s raising a monster before OP is right. Telling a kid nobody likes *them* vs to their behaviour is fucked up.", "I feel like i'm taking crazy pills reading this comment section. Who tf in their right mind thinks it ISN'T bullying to tell literally anyone but especially a 10 year old child that everyone hates them? That is seriously high school bully behaviour.\n\nIf someone said that shit to me when I was a kid it would not have motivated me to behave better, it would have disillusioned me and made me think if no one loves me I have no one to be better for.", "yeah how the hell are people saying nta to this, ofc you don\u2019t tell a literal child this. He\u2019s going to have this weighing on his self esteem for a long long time", "I\u2019m sure he\u2019s gotten the message no one likes him including his parents.  Kids crave limits even if they push against them, it makes them feel safe. When no one sets limits, most kids see it as their parents just don\u2019t care so they start acting out to get any attention.  Of course telling a 10 year old kid no one likes them is wrong but sitting him down, looking him in the eyes and explaining to him his behavior is unacceptable and what is expected is what should happen.  If he throws a fit, tell him to go in the other room and do it but when he\u2019s done to come out and we\u2019ll figure out something to do we both enjoy.

After all these years trying to understand him, I don't even really know anything.\n \nBut I think the OPs sister should try to get access to community resources, therapy for her, therapy for her kid, and try to figure out how to help moderate what is going on.", "OP probably expected the 10 year old to not act like a feral animal . Let's not pretend that this is a big ask ...", "I will say this: The truth needs to be a bitter medicine, not a knife through the heart.\n\n\nA good scolding will do, by telling him that he needs to shape up, not tell him his family hates him.\n\n\nThis is how you get these maladjusted teens and adults that kill others and/or their own family members over feelings of being resented by their peers.", "He didn\u2019t say his behavior is unacceptable.

The level of coddling is staggering.", ">But how does a 10 year old change his behavior with 0 parents guidance? \n\nBy having someone not playing nice all the time and finally saying some hurtful truths, so that you at least realize that you cannot always get away with your shit all the time maybe?\n\nHe edited to say that Dinana was talked to plenty of times and did nothing. In fact, changing the adult is hard, because she is independent and will think that she is mature enough and knows best.", "he's a preteen, not a toddler. He might not be entirely emotionally mature, but at that age a child should be expected to have some measure of sense. If Darius has been suspended from school, stolen belongings, bullies other children and is disliked by his entire extended family - surely he can recognize something is wrong.\n\nRight now it's easy to say its just the mother's fault, but he's old enough to be better and tack on a couple of years more without him changing himself, then a topic like this would draw verdicts of Darius being the AH as *well* as his mother.\n\nWhat OP said was tactless, but it was ultimately a direct intervention. One that might linger, but what else can you propose that'll actually reach Darius? If his mother won't change a damn thing, there needs to be something said that'll actually stick with the kid. Otherwise a little shit will just further cement himself as an AH.\n\nOP is NTA imo.", "Not just bad but worthless.....you lose you self-respect and self-hatred seeps in....ya I know that well.", "That was how my ex thought and continued to think for many years to come.

By ten this sibling knew he wasn\u2019t liked and played up.

Internalized it and wanted to be perfect. I never could though. I have ADHD and school and I don't get along. Mostly because I hate homework and don't want to have to do school work at home. So I ended up escaping into books and stayed there until my late 20s. I've done work on myself and my mindset and my partner helps but I still am a people pleaser and will lie and say things I think people want to hear. My partner hates lying and so this is something we have worked on. And I've definitely learned that I can't make people happy all the time. My sister is even more of a people pleaser.

Even as an adult, I would pretend to know less or act ditzy because I felt like that would make me more likeable. \n\nAnyway, point is that words and comments from your parents can really affect you for a *very* long time.
