I think he's an entitled brat who has gotten away with crap far too many times. I don't think Diana has ever reprimanded him, and every time the little shit acts up Diana makes excuses for him. He's already been suspended from school for stealing, he's a bully to all his cousins, and I know for a fact no one in my family likes him at all. Both of my parents cannot stand him. My mother, a woman who could find the love in her heart to babysit a honey badger, refuses to watch Darius at all because of his behavior. My father will take all of the grandkids out to fish every few months, except for Darius because he's to tempted to throw him out into the lake and drive off (his words not mine.)\n\nOn Monday, I got a call from my sister who panicked because she got called into work. Darius was out of school and her babysitter was not available. No one else in the family will watch Darius so I told her to drop him off and I would watch him. It was a nightmare. Darius was mad he had to spend his day off at my place. He refused to do anything I offered, made a mess in my bathroom, harassed my dog, and had a tantrum because I would not let him use my work computer to play games.\n\nBy lunchtime, I was frustrated beyond all belief. I made him mac and cheese and he demanded I take him to wendy's. He refused to eat and eventually dumped his bowl of food on my floor. At that, I just kinda lost it. I didn't yell or get aggressive at all. I just  sighed and asked him if he realized that everyone in the family literally despised him. I explained that he was at my house because grandma and grandpa cannot stand him, and in fact refuse to let him come to their house because he acts like a little shit. I won't lie, I got pretty brutal.\n\nHe started crying and locked himself in my bathroom until he came out and sat and watched tv till my sister came and got him. I told her what happened and I and her got into a massive argument as well. She called me cruel and I told her that she's to blame and he would have learned eventually.\n\nMy family is split on this. My dad thinks \"the little shit deserved it\" while my siblings have mixed opinions. My mother has told me she's staying out of this but if I feel the need to apologize do it and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nOk, the early consensus is I'm an asshole. That's fine.\n\nA little info. We've talked to Diana about this before. My parents sat her down and told her they will not watch Darius because of how he behaved and that she needs to do something else. We've all had talks with her about him bulling his cousins. She has done nothing.", "created_utc": 1677193097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11abh83/aita_for_telling_my_nephew_the_truth_that_no_one/", "score": 406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA\n\nHe's 10, not 4. He's old enough to hear harsh truths about **his own actions.** If he's acting like a little shit, he needs to be TOLD he's acting like a little shit. \n\nSorry he got his feelings hurt, but when it's to the point that people would rather not be around him AT ALL, it's gotten to the point where someone OTHER than his mother needs to step in and let him know that this behavior will NOT be tolerated any longer and that unless he changes it, relatives will continue to find ways to avoid him.", "I feel bad for the kid because it probably isn't truly his fault, but you're NTA.\n\nYou gave him hard truth at a young age. \\*Maybe\\*, just maybe, this will be a catalyst for him to realize that he needs to change his behavior.\n\nUltimately though it sounds like your sister is a dogshit parent, and she's setting up her son to be a drain on the rest of society and possibly spend his life in the justice system, based on what you've said.\n\nThe tragic thing about this kind of behavior in a 10 year old is that \"we\" collectively cease putting up with it once you're a legal adult. \"Stealing\" as a 10 year old is just a behavior that needs correcting. Stealing as an adult means you go to jail, or worse. Nobody in that system will give two shits that his mother didn't bother to parent him.", "NTA. It is a truth and probably the wake-up call the kid needs as well as your sister. Parents need to start parenting their children and stop sending assholes out into the world.", "Not to endorse the way OP went about things, but I do think other commenters have a point that if mom isn't willing to reign a shitty kid in then having a family member give a reality check isn't the worst thing. It's a bit difficult to ask OP for more info after they've already stated the whole family hates this kid, I'm generally inclined to believe the kid is a little shit who needs checked if nobody is willing to even pick them up and watch them for one day. \n\nAll that said, OP should consider if this was a constructive way of getting the point across or just a satisfying way of 'putting the kid in their place'. A 10 y/o being an AH isn't a license for a 25 y/o to be an AH in return. I'm settling for ESH just because IMO 10 is old enough to know better, especially about dumping food on the floor but 25 is old enough to know \"just being truthful\" isn't a good excuse for being an AH towards a 10 y/o", "NTA. You fought fire with fire. Some kids do well with a gentle but firm \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d. I have a feeling Darius would see that as a weakness.

Your sister needs to get the cotton out of her ears and wake up because she's setting your nephew up for failure.", "He's 10. He's been raised badly. He didn't just wake up one day and decide \"You know what, I'm gonna be a total AH to everyone\". This is your sister's failure, and as much he is a total little sh\\*t, it's not entirely his fault. Because he's 10 and he's never been taught better. \n\nDid he need a serious talking to? Yes. \n\nWas your way the right way to do it? Not really. \n\nIt's better to talk about behaviour and outcomes than make it about the kid. Instead of telling him that his *actions* caused people in the family to not want to be around him (which I would applaud), you told him that his grandparents loathe *him, himself.*\n\nIt's not very effective, because it doesn't give him anything to change. Behaviours can be changed, but if you tell a kid that everyone hates them, that's them as a whole, not something they can change.\n\nIt's not like telling an AH adult that everyone dislikes them cos they're an AH. An adult can figure out what that means and deal with it. But a kid? Their family is their whole world and all the people they rely on, and you told him that basically everyone in his world loathes his very being.\n\nThat's what makes it cruel.\n\nI really don't want to call you an AH, cos I'm not sure I would have lasted even til lunchtime with that little sh\\*t!

He NEEDS to know that his behavior is already costing him relationships and will continue to cost him relationships until he chooses to not act this way. \n\nSometimes the truth is hard to hear, but when the truth is all that's left, that's what you've got to do. Sugar coating it would not have gotten the point across and avoiding it sure wasn't, either.  The pain and rejection be feels will - hopefully - be a huge wake up call.

Childhood is when children learn how to be humans, which is an uncomfortable and difficult process at the best of times. His mom has avoided this process altogether.

Someone needed to tell him sooner or later that his behavior wasn't going to garner him any friends and clearly, it wasn't going to be your sister. And for people who think that you were too harsh, I'd seriously beg them to consider how empathetic you'd be feeling towards a miniature demon that you don't have a good relationship with who just dumped food on the floor, made a mess and threw a tantrum in your house. The reality check was coming to him some way and somehow one way or another, and based on your description of him, Darius actually got off pretty lucky.

However, I totally would have done the same thing. Say it how it is. He\u2019s 10, not 2.

But this consequence is a fact.", "NTA. Darius apparently behaved after you told him some hard truths, so you should have no guilt about what you did.  If a parent won't do her job, it is best a relative do it--that way, strangers won't have to adminster corrective action  to Darius down the line.  Maybe this will serve as a wake-up call to Darius about his behavior.\n\nDon't apologize.

It's cruel to say that to the kid, at the same time it's the truth that probably didn't need to be said, despite how cathartic. \n\nThe child does need to be reprimanded, because he's a bad child and that's why he and his mother don't get a pass, especially the mother. He's still a child and he didn't raise himself. \n\nWhy I feel for you is because my brother went through something similar. He called his nephew the spawn of Satan. He would tell the kid he was the devil incarnate. His wife (bio aunt) was pissed because the kid is only 6. At the same time, he did things that made me believe he would be a serial killer one day. \n\nWhile I told my brother and sister in law, he needs parenting because his behavior is beyond worrisome, nothing was done because the focus was on how mean my brother was. Eventually the nephew went back to his home. A few months after his return, we learned he burned his mother's house down and she got hurt in the fire, we haven't heard an update since. He should be 7 by now.  My brother also refused to allow him back in their house.  I have no idea if the child got the help he needed.  His name is a sore subject, so I can't even broach the subject anymore.\n\nIn all, your reaction overwrote any influence you may have had with your sister. Now, you're just the mean guy making kids cry. Hopefully, she learns to do better sooner rather than later.  \n\nIn the end, you should apologize for not handling the situation with the best care and set a boundary such as, he's not allowed in my home again.

Apologize to your nephew if you can and then explain what you meant to address was his behavior NOT HIM.

Try and give him a safe space to say why he acts the way he does? I think the words you said make it ESH because you took it too far.

I think he's an entitled brat who has gotten away with crap far too many times. I don't think Diana has ever reprimanded him, and every time the little shit acts up Diana makes excuses for him. He's already been suspended from school for stealing, he's a bully to all his cousins, and I know for a fact no one in my family likes him at all. Both of my parents cannot stand him. My mother, a woman who could find the love in her heart to babysit a honey badger, refuses to watch Darius at all because of his behavior. My father will take all of the grandkids out to fish every few months, except for Darius because he's to tempted to throw him out into the lake and drive off (his words not mine.)  \n\n\nOn Monday, I got a call from my sister who panicked because she got called into work. Darius was out of school and her babysitter was not available. No one else in the family will watch Darius so I told her to drop him off and I would watch him. It was a nightmare. Darius was mad he had to spend his day off at my place. He refused to do anything I offered, made a mess in my bathroom, harassed my dog, and had a tantrum because I would not let him use my work computer to play games. \n\nBy lunchtime, I was frustrated beyond all belief. I made him mac and cheese and he demanded I take him to wendy's. He refused to eat and eventually dumped his bowl of food on my floor. At that, I just kinda lost it. I didn't yell or get aggressive at all. I just signed and asked him if he realized that everyone in the family literally despised him. I explained that he was at my house because grandma and grandpa cannot stand him, and in fact refuse to let him come to their house because he acts like a little shit. I won't lie, I got pretty brutal.\n\nHe started crying and locked himself in my bathroom until he came out and sat and watched tv till my sister came and got him. I told her what happened and I and her got into a massive argument as well. She called me cruel and I told her that she's to blame and he would have learned eventually.\n\nMy family is split on this. My dad thinks \"the little shit deserved it\" while my siblings have mixed opinions. My mother has told me she's staying out of this but if I feel the need to apologize do it and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you people think?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why shouldn\u2019t he know he\u2019s being a little shit? At least now he realizes it and he can work on himself instead of letting his mom enable bad behavior", "NTA \n\nWhy would OP apologize?

I've met far too many kids like this that should've been told what said to him a long time ago. And 10 is NOT too young to hear it. It's not like he's 3. You're also young enough for him to view you more a big brother than the uncle you are and what you said is 100% the reality check from a big brother he needed to hear. It's not like his own dad said this stuff to him or your sister who's his mom.  If your sister didn't like it, she should start acting like a real parent and set boundaries for her child. Kids like him grow up to be awful adults and the sooner they get a reality check the better it is for literally everyone that will interact with him going forward.", "NTA I think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable and good to be blunt with kids.

That's not cool.", "Any kid that dumps a bowl of food on the floor is an asshole. I cannot imagine ever behaving like that. NTA , he should be exposed to reality.", "Esh.  Even if it was a true statement that is still a child. I don't like children and I wouldn't have been so blunt with him.

Telling him everyone hates him makes everything worse. \nI read the update where you said everyone has talked to her and she refuses to correct his behavior. She needs to snap out of it because that kids will continue to grow up into a menace, where the real world will not coddle him the way she is. She is 100% setting him up for failure in life. If she cannot control him, she needs to seek out a therapist because it might be underlying issues that only someone who is certified can help with.

A friend of my ex wife had a kid like this, she treated this kid like as if he were an adult and a buddy.

Mom was furious but no reprimand. Later the next day he had just gotten a brand new Swiss Army knife and he was doing something that I knew he was going to slice the F\u2026 on one of his fingers. I told him I saw what he was doing if you\u2019re going to hurt yourself, which he replied, I know what I\u2019m doing so shut up, this is a 10 year old. So I turned around and said OK not 10 minutes later he does exactly what I thought he was going to do slice the hell out of his finger I was running screaming to mom and I just walked by and said I told you so.

He does need to learn his actions will impact his relationships with other people, and you definitely got that point across\u2026but he also needs to learn that family is there for you, to steer you in the right direction so he grows up to not be the kind of person that tells a ten year old everyone in their family hates them. \ud83d\ude02", "Yta.

In fact everyone around that boy should do what OP did till his mother do something to fix his attitude per OP's edit.", "bro 10 is old enough to know right from wrong he cried because he reflected. hopefully he becomes a better person from this.", "Wait, you've been a therapist for 10 years, yet you think it's perfectly fine for a grown adult to tell a 10-year-old child that his entire family loathes him?? Wow I pity your poor clients.\n\nOP could and should have told the kid that his *behavior* was unacceptable, and it would have been fine to say that his *behavior* makes people not want spend time with him, but OP didn't do that. And he's 10, so he's not going to be able to take what OP said and extrapolate 'if I want people to want to spend time with me, I need to change X, Y, and Z'; he just heard 'my whole family hates me for who I am.'", "I\u2019m pretty torn over my rating. \n\n10 is old enough to hear some criticism on his behaviour, I agree. If a kid acted like that, around me, I would have lost my patience too. I sympathize with that. \n\nBeing told no one likes you, hurts\u2026.especially from family.", "Yeah, considering his age I\u2019m wondering if he may be neurodivergent and if so he may just not pick up on social cues and needs things explicitly stated. \n\nPeople on here are talking about how emotionally damaging this is to him, but I\u2019m wondering how much more would it be for him to turn 18 and realize he has no one that will call him family or spend any time with him. At least now he can try and change.", "This. He isn\u2019t just badly behaved because he has no boundaries. \n\nThis is a kid who lashes out at others. He\u2019s not just selfish or bratty. There\u2019s aggression here. \n\nOne of the lines I find myself saying a lot to my 7 year old these days is that I have certain rules out of love for him. When I say you can\u2019t stay up til 1, or play on the iPad all day, or talk to me or your sister with unkindness, it\u2019s because I know you are a kind person who has the potential to be whoever you want to be. But that means you have to be healthy and know how to deal with tough stuff. \n\nKids inherently understand that. At some point a child understands that a parent who enforces zero rules, *doesn\u2019t care* enough to do so.\n\nSo to say that no one in his family likes or loves him? Who does this kid have then?", "children are not that stupid. I've been ten, and I know to fix anti-social behavior when people around me calls me out on it.", "Yup So she gets to deal with. All by herself!", "Yeah, don't get all these people trying to coddle the kid. Hopefully, this is a learning curve, and he starts to pull his head in", "But OP didn't address his behavior. He told him everyone despises HIM. He essentially told an actual CHILD that he is a worthless human being.", "OP can apologize for the delivery. It may have been the truth but it sounds like it may have been too much truth to dump on a 10 year old that suddenly and fully. Might be good to frame it as cause and effect using specific examples to show how other people in the family interpret and feel about his behavior, rather than just say they hate him.", "Lessons learned: Adults are mean.

So you're saying CPS helps with this?", "This was not the truth. From the OP's post the family rightfully has an issue with this kid's behavior. If he changes his behavior they won't have the issue anymore. If they hate the kid himself, it wouldn't matter how he behaves. There are tons of studies on this distinction between guilt (I have done something bad) and shame (I am bad) and how they impact behavior outcomes. \n\nBullying literally means seek to harm, intimidate, or coerce (someone perceived as vulnerable) OP was trying to intimidate and coerce a person who is still a child aka vulnerable.\n\nMy childhood and your childhood are immaterial. This was intentionally cruel and likely will not have the outcome OP wants.", "Yep and he should have been taught boundaries and consequences before. Telling a kid they are hated by their entire family teaching them nothing about either. 10 is still a child and kids who are told they aren't loved don't tend to work to improve themselves.", "Face it, the kid already knows that his family doesn't like him. He is left out of things all of the time. Mom is too busy enabling him to correct him. The time for sugar coating things is long gone. He's 10, not 3. From comments, OP and her family have tried to connect the mom with reality and it hasn't worked.  Your suggestion is great if he was 3 or 5. You can't honestly believe that a 10 y.o. doesn't know it's not acceptable to dump food on the floor because they wanted something else.", "Yes. If they aren\u2019t taught, they don\u2019t know. He\u2019s not old enough to learn these lessons by himself. You can help them learn, but not by being cruel. I had a nephew in this exact situation.

Scare her, maybe.", "This is very true. People set the bar so low for kids sometimes that this sort of behavior is the result.\n\nMy best friend had 2 boys, I had to stop visiting with them because they acted horribly and were terrible to my kids.  One time her youngest wanted soda, all I had was water and juice. I got him some juice, he looked me in the eye and poured it out on my living room floor. Yeah, same kid said he wished I was his mom because I went to college, and his mom didn\u2019t. I told him he would have hated me, I expect good manners and he didn\u2019t have any.(he was an adult, so I wasn\u2019t dissing a kid)", "There was not the edit when I commented, but still an AH. It needs to be shifted. Saying I  don't like the way you act gives the uncle a chance to say if you listen when I ask you to do something we can hang out and have fun is different than saying nobody likes you. Kids play that stuff over & over in their heads, and it can really mess them up. Yes, he's acting like a monster because that's what his mom created. Saying something shitty & hurtful in the moment isn't going to fix it. Telling him how to act better so they can spend time together could though.", "Apparently the little shit is a bully to his cousins as well. But sounds like he needs therapy of some sort to correct his behavior.", "YTA. He\u2019s 10 and he\u2019s not your child! The appropriate thing to do was to tell him you were calling his mother to get him. Then you should have told her, in private, that he can\u2019t come over to your place anymore. Is this some sick source of pride to you? Because you sure as hell seem pompous about one upping a CHILD. Grow up.", "I only see where the family has expressed their dislike of Darius privately, not specifically to his mother. I'd still go with OP as TA just because Darius is a kid and needs all the help he can get right now to find a better path.", "The sister disengaging from the conversation does not mean OP should force the issue on a 10 year old.", "Have they told her that they all can\u2019t stand him?

They all focus on Darius", "That doesn\u2019t mean that the other adults in his life, who are is blood relatives, can\u2019t set boundaries with him. How about some positive reinforcement? \u201cDarius, I love you, buddy, but the rule in the house is don\u2019t poke the dog. Got it? The rule in this house is that the person who made the mess needs to clean it up... here are some paper towels; I\u2019ll scoop up the mac and cheese and you wipe the floor.

But if the kid acts good, thing can get better.\n\nIf you tell a child that no one likes them, they don't have the emotional maturity to understand that they could be liked if they behaved better. They'll just think everyone hates them and nothing they do can change it.", "Showing them you're a bigger bully can certainly solve the behavior issues short-term, but it still teaches them that the bigger bully wins. It does nothing to address the actual problem. It teaches them that they need to grow up and be meaner so that it'll be their turn again to get their own way.", "It's not always a mental health problem. It could just as easily be a cognitive issue. But even if the parent's behavior is the sole reason for the child's behavior (which I doubt given the severity of the behavior), that still requires diagnosis and therapy at this point. And telling a child his entire family doesn't love him, to the point where he's locking himself in a room crying, is abusive. People who tried committing suicide often say they felt nobody loves them. A grown man can't inflict that on a child.", "More like mission accomplished.", "He's still 10, what auntie did was emotional child abuse.\n\nI've studied this to an extent during my postgraduate education.\n\nHe is a child, she is an adult. \n\nShe lost it as she said herself, she's the adult.", "Now Darius who is a 10yo kid thinks that his whole family hates him for who he is even though it\u2019s actually his mom taught him that bad behaviours are okay, that he doesn\u2019t do anything wrong because his mom keeps making excuses and enabling him. You never know what childhood memory would imprint on you to shape your whole personality later onto your adulthood, this traumatic experience very likely had done it to Darius considering his quietness afterwards. Do you still say it\u2019s a huge favour?", "I already said the mother is also at fault.\n\nI think there's a balance between being stern with a child and literally making a 10 year old cry by telling them they're hated by their whole family and it really shouldn't be so hard for a 25yr old, who is being superior about maturity especially, to find, but I guess you disagree... so thanks for your strange unsolicited opinion but I didn't make the post so give it to OP.", "Jesus, I hope you're not a parent.", "Right??", "The problem is, 10 is too old. This is something this kid should\u2019ve heard years ago, I can only imagine what his teachers have to deal with on a regular basis.", "I didn\u2019t say he was stupid.

He\u2019s still a child. Being told your entire family hates you at 10? That\u2019s going to cause lasting damage. \n\nHe likely knows his behavior is unacceptable.

You really just continue to jump to extremes, don't you?", "I\u2019m sure he knows it\u2019s \u201cbad\u201d behavior, but he hasn\u2019t been taught the consequences. Schools are extremely limited to what they can do without parental buy in. Reading between the lines, mom probably would have given in to this behavior and bought him Wendy\u2019s. He\u2019s been taught it gets him what he wants, not that it will make his family hate him.", "OP still needs to find an approach that doesn't involved emotionally crushing a child.", "I\u2019m just wondering at what point do these people think someone should sit him down and talk to him?

The longer this goes on the less likely anyone will be able to change their opinion of him. \n\nForget about middle school. Those kids are brutal. Do they think it\u2019s better for him to go off to that blindly?", "I do wish people would stop expecting him to just know how to behave.\n\nHe absolutely will have seen good behavior modelled at school by others, but if he has never been taught that poor behaviors don't get him what he wants he won't stop.  \n\nHe doesn't want to be in class, he misbehaves then gets what he wants when he's removed for example.\n\nThis is a complete and utter total failure of parenting.
