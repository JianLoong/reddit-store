I told them I'd made plans to call my wife and eat dinner with her. \n\nI was then informed that, apparently, there is some tradition of all my coworkers eating dinner together the last night. I said I wasn't informed and we had already eaten dinner together every other night, but I hoped they enjoyed themselves. My boss then said it was something I had to attend, then some of my coworkers agreed and said it was an important part of the conference. \n\nI told my boss and coworkers that it was outside work hours, unpaid, and not scheduled, plus I prefer my wife's company to theirs, so I was not going.

Basic dowlow: this is what these conferences are generally like, at least every single one I've been to  over a 30 year career.

It sounds like your delivery must have been relatively harsh, considering the strong reactions you mentioned.

They're happy they get to see you're real, and you get to keep working from home.\n\nYour little stunt might have cost you a future promotion as now you don't look like a team player at all and you aren't taking the little time you have to get to know your co workers face to face.

If I'm keeping it real you are on the older side working remotely anyway, I don't think skipping a dinner would have hurt you there. \n\nI tend to believe bosses just want control and extroverts just don't understand why people may not want to hang out with them more than necessary at times. The one thing I'll agree with other commenters on is that a lot of networking and business deals go on in these conferences. \n\nThat's all well and good but this was the last night and this wasn't a client.

You may have just hurt any future chances at advancement.", "NAH and tbh I'm surprised at how many people are saying this is standard. I've been to my fair share of conferences and there's a LOT of mandated socialising but its not quite as bad as this. Its also not usually literally mandatory just highly expected. Generally I find that having something pre arranged like a video call works as a valid excuse, for one dinner.

It's exhausting to have to be \"on\" in front of a crowd for the whole day.  I would want to recharge my social battery, too. I'm sure op's wife is a comfort.

I think you already had done enough time with them and deserved a night with your wife. \n\nMy attitude if they didn't like it? Fuck 'em. And fuck the entire mentality of \"networking\" and job climbing. It's all corporate bullshit and amounts to almost zero at the end of the day.", "NTA. It\u2019s sweet to see how much you enjoy spending time with your wife, and conferences are bullshit. \n\nIf you want to advance your career, are hoping for promotions, raises, etc, I would definitely try to carve out time to spend with your coworkers if possible, maybe doing something more low-key, to repair those relationships.\n\nIf that sounds like literal hell and you\u2019re content where you are, then don\u2019t.

If you value your job, do recognise that cultivating work relationships is essential no matter how much you hate it unless you can afford to retire. To put things in perspective, you mention being a remote worker hence the work meals which add up to less than five in total were all that you needed to tolerate in a year (?). I get that everyone wants to do what they want and we dislike obligations, we avoid things we hate including socialising with colleagues etc but if the matter simply involves a meal and it only happens once in a while, it seems to me to be that it is silly and ott for bring so rigid.\n\nIf you truly want to get out of such meals, I would suggest giving an excuse like feeling sick instead of being so blunt.", "Sorta NAH but as much as many of us want workplaces were merit just speaks for itself that is almost never the case.

Next time (if there is a next time conference) have a better and polite response prepared to skip the annoying dinners/parties. If you aren\u2019t interested in moving up by networking they do feel like a waste of time and I understand you wanting to skip them.
