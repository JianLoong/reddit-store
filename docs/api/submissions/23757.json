I said I wasn't informed and we had already eaten dinner together every other night, but I hoped they enjoyed themselves.

They're happy they get to see you're real, and you get to keep working from home.\n\nYour little stunt might have cost you a future promotion as now you don't look like a team player at all and you aren't taking the little time you have to get to know your co workers face to face.

If I'm keeping it real you are on the older side working remotely anyway, I don't think skipping a dinner would have hurt you there. \n\nI tend to believe bosses just want control and extroverts just don't understand why people may not want to hang out with them more than necessary at times. The one thing I'll agree with other commenters on is that a lot of networking and business deals go on in these conferences. \n\nThat's all well and good but this was the last night and this wasn't a client.

You may have just hurt any future chances at advancement.", "NAH and tbh I'm surprised at how many people are saying this is standard. I've been to my fair share of conferences and there's a LOT of mandated socialising but its not quite as bad as this. Its also not usually literally mandatory just highly expected. Generally I find that having something pre arranged like a video call works as a valid excuse, for one dinner.

I think you already had done enough time with them and deserved a night with your wife. \n\nMy attitude if they didn't like it? Fuck 'em.

Do you want to work your way up the corporate ladder and earn promotions etc? Then you probably screwed yourself by saying that.  If you want to just do your job and go home and not care about moving up, then you're fine.", "I feel you, and you screwed this one up.\n\nYes, of course it's unreasonable to expect you to be \"on\" all day at the conference and then continue socializing at dinner... every day of the stupid conference.  However, when you go to a conference like this, the expectation is *not* 8:30 to 5 and then you're off.  It's that you're on company time the whole trip.  Yes, it's a nightmare for us introverts.\n\nUnfortunately, that's honestly not negotiable.  The entire trip is work time.  Socializing with coworkers is work time.  Call it networking, call it team building, call it whatever, but it's *work time*.\n\nNow, is that fair?  Heck no.  So you have some options about how to handle it.  I haven't been to a conference in a while, but one tactic I've had success with in the past is telling my boss that this is *not* my bag, I am *not* looking forward to it, I will *not* be having a good time, I am going to this conference under duress... but I will show up and participate, fully engaged... in exchange for a reasonable amount of comp time that covers the evenings and late night sessions.  When I run across something like this that feels to me like unreasonable expectations that are standard and given, that's how I approach it: \"If they want this unreasonable thing from me, what should I ask for in return?\"  Conferences are *time,* my most precious commodity, and so for me, I want time back in return.  A couple of days off the next week is not at all an unreasonable request because as an introvert, you likely need that just to recover from having to go anyway.\n\nSome of this misunderstanding is on your boss not explaining to you what to expect at a conference, since it seems you haven't been to one before.  Your boss may not have realized that you have gotten to your late 40s escaping ever going to a conference, though, and some of this is on you for not asking for an itinerary in advance and even having an informal chat about expectations.\n\nYou're not exactly TA here.  NAH because the person you've primarily screwed is yourself.  You did a great routine until the end and then flubbed the landing.  Unfortunately, you did this in such a way as to dramatically ruin the goodwill you earned by going to the conference, so I'm sorry to say that your entire trip was basically a waste.  It's a learning experience for the future.", "NTA but I agree with others it was naive to assume the last night was yours just because it's unscheduled. \n\nI worked for a company once, blue collar work but twice a year they had formal meetings. Guys in black ties, women in gowns when our everyday uniform was literally jeans and a button down shirt and we all ended up grimy by day's end. Even if not for other issues, I'd have quit the job before attending another of those events.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nMandatory social engagements are unfortunately a part of corporate life.  It's complete BS but it's how it works at a lot of companies.  But you're not an AH for preferring to spend time with your wife.", "Then he should be paid for his time. All of his time that he\u2019s expected to perform. This kind of culture is toxic", "TLDR\nNTA with the caveat that a bit of research ahead of time could have cleared up the misunderstanding.\n\nAgree with this OP. NTA as your intentions were good (you weren't given a heads up) and it sounds like this was your first go at this (conference setting). I get wanting to spend time with your family over coworkers, but conferences are those times where outside of an hour or two in the morning and before you go to bed, it's fully a work trip. No, you aren't getting paid for the extra hours, but it's an opportunity to network with others within and outside your company. Is it fun? Not always. But if you want to progress within the company, this is part of that game (unpaid hours for future raises/promotions).\nThat being said, if you have no higher aspirations up the corporate ladder, then you can freely bail on these activities. Just know that it will cause others to see you as \"not a team player\".\nSo the ultimate question would come down to:\nDo you want a promotion within this company? If so, I would apologize to my boss and explain I thought I had that night free and mistakenly booked a \"date night\" with my wife. If a promotion is not on your list of goals, then you're fine.\nThe last thing I will say is that being invited to a conference is not something that \"low level\" employees typically get invited to, so that is likely the reason these coworkers are confused by your actions. Getting to travel to another location, with your hotel and meals paid for (not a small expense for the company) is seen as a benefit and comes with certain expectations, whether you agree with those expectations or not.\nBest of luck going forward. Again, you are NTA. I just feel your coworkers' expectations were reasonable, but I personally wouldn't have pressed someone else to the point your boss and others did.", "The idea that you can't get a promotion w/o all the networking shit is total nonsense.

Much like you don't think much of this scenario, I'm sure the folks that find a lot of value in it don't think much of you (which I suspect is just fine by you).\n\nSome folks aren't big on being social and that's cool, but some are and that's cool too. You seem to look down on it pretty hard, lots of disdain coming from you in these replies.  Your prerogative but damn...you don't sound very fun.", "\nI would say your response to not going is what made YTA but not wanting to go for an unpaid socializing event does not make you the asshole. \n\nIt sounds like you don't really enjoy your job? Maybe reevaluate if this is a company you want to work for.\n\nBut your love for your wife is endearing, and I hope you got to spend quality time upon your return.", "They are giving you food and drink in exchange for your time as well as the intangible benefits of networking in a more casual environment\n\nYou and op don\u2019t seem to understand the corporate lifestyle", "I like employers who don't encroach on my time after my contracted hours.", "Yeah there are people simply not cut out for this. The amount of mental exhaustion id feel in a daily basis from having to socialize and be \u2018on point\u2019 presentation/professional wise would be unfathomable.", "Love your user name!!!!  Loved reading that book with my daughter.", "The commentor is saying that they might draw the conclusion that you hate them based on your actions and other words, even though you didn\u2019t intend for that. \n\nAnd I get it - my partner is also a remote worker and hates the schmoozing part of his job as an introvert. But he also knows it\u2019s the way to get ahead in literally every industry. \n\nQuite frankly, your honesty was a bit too blunt and socially awkward. Next time if you can\u2019t suck it up, call off by saying you aren\u2019t feeling well. There was no need to share everything you did.\n\nHowever, I do commend your devotion to your wife! Again, my partner skews similar to you so he makes sure he carves time to FT between sessions and after dinner if possible.", "Honey, people are stupid and ( most ) have been told their entire lives that they're wonderful and everyone loves them, so any form of rejection means you hate them because of the lies they've been told. NTA", "But they didn\u2019t know that dude, they don\u2019t know you. You\u2019re a remote worker they don\u2019t really interact with. They wanted to get to know you and now you\u2019re the asshole obsessed with his wife. And that\u2019s perfectly fine but not the goal of inviting you to the conference. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting time with people you actually care about, I\u2019m an introvert myself, but at work you fake it.", "It's no *wonder* he was burnt out. He couldn't get away from anyone for 5 whole minutes.", "It's absolutely not. That's how most work relationships should be.\n\nShit gets muddy fast when coworkers are your only friends.", "That is very fair, I definitely was more than a bit short after the pushback from my boss and coworkers. \n\nNo, I don't. I liked working for a charity much more, but when they had to downsize their paid employees massively I thought a few years of corporate work would at least give a very cushy bit of retirement fund, but at this point I think I'd rather just find another charity. \n\nThank you, we certainly will. I miss her.", "Not saying it isn\u2019t how things are but it\u2019s ridiculous and is not how they should be", "That sounds like hell on earth", "Thank fuck I'll never have to work in corporate.", "You don't seem to understand that many many people despise this lifestyle yet still manage to exist within it. Free food is for dogs what kind of loser cares about free food and drinks, \"fuck you, pay me\".\n\nI refuse to accept the pointless bullshit they give us at Christmas etc, it's a massive waste of resources that few appreciate.", "I stick by my statement. All I\u2019m saying is, actions, in this case lack of action, does have repercussions in the business world. You don\u2019t have to like it or agree with it, it is simply fact.", "Exactly, they don't know me, and we aren't going to be buddies, so why press the issue that I have to go to their stupid dinner when I've already gone to every single event and dinner and session with them all day for four days already? \n\nAccording to my boss, the goal of inviting me to this conference was to have a quantitative expert there, given some of their work/goals. If the goal was to become friends, I would have pretended I was sick before even going rather than just telling them I didn't want to go, as I told my boss to begin with.", "Simply put you have your priorities set and they have consequences which is okay. All of us make choices and live by it. Declining was still fine but your response did burn lot of bridges but if you are okay with it then so be it. You don't owe your time to anyone and these are more for your own benefit than anything else. Enjoy your time with your wife. It sounds really good.", "Humans are communal by nature, building the communal ties within the sphere you chose to inhabit is human nature"]}
