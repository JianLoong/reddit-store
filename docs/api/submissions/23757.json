They're happy they get to see you're real, and you get to keep working from home.\n\nYour little stunt might have cost you a future promotion as now you don't look like a team player at all and you aren't taking the little time you have to get to know your co workers face to face.

If I'm keeping it real you are on the older side working remotely anyway, I don't think skipping a dinner would have hurt you there. \n\nI tend to believe bosses just want control and extroverts just don't understand why people may not want to hang out with them more than necessary at times. The one thing I'll agree with other commenters on is that a lot of networking and business deals go on in these conferences. \n\nThat's all well and good but this was the last night and this wasn't a client.

You may have just hurt any future chances at advancement.", "NAH and tbh I'm surprised at how many people are saying this is standard. I've been to my fair share of conferences and there's a LOT of mandated socialising but its not quite as bad as this. Its also not usually literally mandatory just highly expected. Generally I find that having something pre arranged like a video call works as a valid excuse, for one dinner.

I think you already had done enough time with them and deserved a night with your wife. \n\nMy attitude if they didn't like it? Fuck 'em.

Do you want to work your way up the corporate ladder and earn promotions etc? Then you probably screwed yourself by saying that.  If you want to just do your job and go home and not care about moving up, then you're fine.", "I feel you, and you screwed this one up.\n\nYes, of course it's unreasonable to expect you to be \"on\" all day at the conference and then continue socializing at dinner... every day of the stupid conference.  However, when you go to a conference like this, the expectation is *not* 8:30 to 5 and then you're off.  It's that you're on company time the whole trip.  Yes, it's a nightmare for us introverts.\n\nUnfortunately, that's honestly not negotiable.  The entire trip is work time.  Socializing with coworkers is work time.  Call it networking, call it team building, call it whatever, but it's *work time*.\n\nNow, is that fair?  Heck no.  So you have some options about how to handle it.  I haven't been to a conference in a while, but one tactic I've had success with in the past is telling my boss that this is *not* my bag, I am *not* looking forward to it, I will *not* be having a good time, I am going to this conference under duress... but I will show up and participate, fully engaged... in exchange for a reasonable amount of comp time that covers the evenings and late night sessions.  When I run across something like this that feels to me like unreasonable expectations that are standard and given, that's how I approach it: \"If they want this unreasonable thing from me, what should I ask for in return?\"  Conferences are *time,* my most precious commodity, and so for me, I want time back in return.  A couple of days off the next week is not at all an unreasonable request because as an introvert, you likely need that just to recover from having to go anyway.\n\nSome of this misunderstanding is on your boss not explaining to you what to expect at a conference, since it seems you haven't been to one before.  Your boss may not have realized that you have gotten to your late 40s escaping ever going to a conference, though, and some of this is on you for not asking for an itinerary in advance and even having an informal chat about expectations.\n\nYou're not exactly TA here.  NAH because the person you've primarily screwed is yourself.  You did a great routine until the end and then flubbed the landing.  Unfortunately, you did this in such a way as to dramatically ruin the goodwill you earned by going to the conference, so I'm sorry to say that your entire trip was basically a waste.  It's a learning experience for the future.", "NTA but I agree with others it was naive to assume the last night was yours just because it's unscheduled. \n\nI worked for a company once, blue collar work but twice a year they had formal meetings. Guys in black ties, women in gowns when our everyday uniform was literally jeans and a button down shirt and we all ended up grimy by day's end. Even if not for other issues, I'd have quit the job before attending another of those events.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nMandatory social engagements are unfortunately a part of corporate life.  It's complete BS but it's how it works at a lot of companies.  But you're not an AH for preferring to spend time with your wife.", "Then he should be paid for his time. All of his time that he\u2019s expected to perform. This kind of culture is toxic", "TLDR\nNTA with the caveat that a bit of research ahead of time could have cleared up the misunderstanding.\n\nAgree with this OP. NTA as your intentions were good (you weren't given a heads up) and it sounds like this was your first go at this (conference setting). I get wanting to spend time with your family over coworkers, but conferences are those times where outside of an hour or two in the morning and before you go to bed, it's fully a work trip. No, you aren't getting paid for the extra hours, but it's an opportunity to network with others within and outside your company. Is it fun? Not always. But if you want to progress within the company, this is part of that game (unpaid hours for future raises/promotions).\nThat being said, if you have no higher aspirations up the corporate ladder, then you can freely bail on these activities. Just know that it will cause others to see you as \"not a team player\".\nSo the ultimate question would come down to:\nDo you want a promotion within this company? If so, I would apologize to my boss and explain I thought I had that night free and mistakenly booked a \"date night\" with my wife. If a promotion is not on your list of goals, then you're fine.\nThe last thing I will say is that being invited to a conference is not something that \"low level\" employees typically get invited to, so that is likely the reason these coworkers are confused by your actions. Getting to travel to another location, with your hotel and meals paid for (not a small expense for the company) is seen as a benefit and comes with certain expectations, whether you agree with those expectations or not.\nBest of luck going forward. Again, you are NTA. I just feel your coworkers' expectations were reasonable, but I personally wouldn't have pressed someone else to the point your boss and others did.", "The idea that you can't get a promotion w/o all the networking shit is total nonsense.

I do find it naive to expect that when you're a remote worker that you expect the one time you're around coworkers that all your evenings are your own and socializing after hours should happen. \n\nA lot of the reasons they want to have maximum time together is team building, especially difficult in remote settings. It's also a good way to make yourself a human being to your higher ups, coworkers, as you'll be more likely to be given leeway and promotions than person who is distant and unengaged. \n\nAn easier way to get out of commitments would just have been to say you're exhausted because you have problems sleeping in strange beds. That you need to catch up on sleep. That you're feeling kind of queasy and just trying to make it through the day. That you have a migraine and are just trying to make it to day's end and you're so sorry to miss out.\n\nBasically, give an acceptable lie. Or don't say anything play along and don't go and say you had some unfortunate stomach stuff come up so they don't ask further questions. Say you're so bummed too, but hope they had fun. \n\nAnyway, you shoot yourself in the foot by being too honest and saying stuff like this to coworkers and your superiors. Easier and more diplomatic ways to evade things. Next time just ask what the evening expectations are and don't wait to ask. Sometimes if you do that you can evade going by making up shit like you have some learning classes you signed up for remotely you do on that evening, or that you have insomnia and normally try to catch up on sleep. Ask which are necessary because you want to be a \"team player\" but also are aware many evenings you're not going to be 100. \n\nGood luck though.
