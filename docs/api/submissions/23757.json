They're happy they get to see you're real, and you get to keep working from home.\n\nYour little stunt might have cost you a future promotion as now you don't look like a team player at all and you aren't taking the little time you have to get to know your co workers face to face.

If I'm keeping it real you are on the older side working remotely anyway, I don't think skipping a dinner would have hurt you there. \n\nI tend to believe bosses just want control and extroverts just don't understand why people may not want to hang out with them more than necessary at times. The one thing I'll agree with other commenters on is that a lot of networking and business deals go on in these conferences. \n\nThat's all well and good but this was the last night and this wasn't a client.

You may have just hurt any future chances at advancement.", "NAH and tbh I'm surprised at how many people are saying this is standard. I've been to my fair share of conferences and there's a LOT of mandated socialising but its not quite as bad as this. Its also not usually literally mandatory just highly expected. Generally I find that having something pre arranged like a video call works as a valid excuse, for one dinner.

I think you already had done enough time with them and deserved a night with your wife. \n\nMy attitude if they didn't like it? Fuck 'em.

Do you want to work your way up the corporate ladder and earn promotions etc? Then you probably screwed yourself by saying that.  If you want to just do your job and go home and not care about moving up, then you're fine.", "I feel you, and you screwed this one up.\n\nYes, of course it's unreasonable to expect you to be \"on\" all day at the conference and then continue socializing at dinner... every day of the stupid conference.  However, when you go to a conference like this, the expectation is *not* 8:30 to 5 and then you're off.  It's that you're on company time the whole trip.  Yes, it's a nightmare for us introverts.\n\nUnfortunately, that's honestly not negotiable.  The entire trip is work time.  Socializing with coworkers is work time.  Call it networking, call it team building, call it whatever, but it's *work time*.\n\nNow, is that fair?  Heck no.  So you have some options about how to handle it.  I haven't been to a conference in a while, but one tactic I've had success with in the past is telling my boss that this is *not* my bag, I am *not* looking forward to it, I will *not* be having a good time, I am going to this conference under duress... but I will show up and participate, fully engaged... in exchange for a reasonable amount of comp time that covers the evenings and late night sessions.  When I run across something like this that feels to me like unreasonable expectations that are standard and given, that's how I approach it: \"If they want this unreasonable thing from me, what should I ask for in return?\"  Conferences are *time,* my most precious commodity, and so for me, I want time back in return.  A couple of days off the next week is not at all an unreasonable request because as an introvert, you likely need that just to recover from having to go anyway.\n\nSome of this misunderstanding is on your boss not explaining to you what to expect at a conference, since it seems you haven't been to one before.  Your boss may not have realized that you have gotten to your late 40s escaping ever going to a conference, though, and some of this is on you for not asking for an itinerary in advance and even having an informal chat about expectations.\n\nYou're not exactly TA here.  NAH because the person you've primarily screwed is yourself.  You did a great routine until the end and then flubbed the landing.  Unfortunately, you did this in such a way as to dramatically ruin the goodwill you earned by going to the conference, so I'm sorry to say that your entire trip was basically a waste.  It's a learning experience for the future.", "NTA but I agree with others it was naive to assume the last night was yours just because it's unscheduled. \n\nI worked for a company once, blue collar work but twice a year they had formal meetings. Guys in black ties, women in gowns when our everyday uniform was literally jeans and a button down shirt and we all ended up grimy by day's end. Even if not for other issues, I'd have quit the job before attending another of those events.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nMandatory social engagements are unfortunately a part of corporate life.  It's complete BS but it's how it works at a lot of companies.  But you're not an AH for preferring to spend time with your wife.", "Then he should be paid for his time. All of his time that he\u2019s expected to perform. This kind of culture is toxic", "TLDR\nNTA with the caveat that a bit of research ahead of time could have cleared up the misunderstanding.\n\nAgree with this OP. NTA as your intentions were good (you weren't given a heads up) and it sounds like this was your first go at this (conference setting). I get wanting to spend time with your family over coworkers, but conferences are those times where outside of an hour or two in the morning and before you go to bed, it's fully a work trip. No, you aren't getting paid for the extra hours, but it's an opportunity to network with others within and outside your company. Is it fun? Not always. But if you want to progress within the company, this is part of that game (unpaid hours for future raises/promotions).\nThat being said, if you have no higher aspirations up the corporate ladder, then you can freely bail on these activities. Just know that it will cause others to see you as \"not a team player\".\nSo the ultimate question would come down to:\nDo you want a promotion within this company? If so, I would apologize to my boss and explain I thought I had that night free and mistakenly booked a \"date night\" with my wife. If a promotion is not on your list of goals, then you're fine.\nThe last thing I will say is that being invited to a conference is not something that \"low level\" employees typically get invited to, so that is likely the reason these coworkers are confused by your actions. Getting to travel to another location, with your hotel and meals paid for (not a small expense for the company) is seen as a benefit and comes with certain expectations, whether you agree with those expectations or not.\nBest of luck going forward. Again, you are NTA. I just feel your coworkers' expectations were reasonable, but I personally wouldn't have pressed someone else to the point your boss and others did.", "The idea that you can't get a promotion w/o all the networking shit is total nonsense.

I don\u2019t need to know the inside leg measurements of my colleagues to operate effectively with them and certainly don\u2019t want to share what\u2019s happening in my life with people who could look to use things against me to further themselves.

Honestly, I fucking hate these forced work gatherings - why on earth would I want to socialise with people in work if I wouldn\u2019t naturally socialise with them outside of work - I mean, some people are just asshats (none of my current colleagues are mind you).

I have been asked to go to dinners at conference and I have accepted some offers and declined others. Nobody has ever told me: they are mandatory.

Especially since he was asked if he was \u201cexcited\u201d which smacks of some toxic positivity extroverted BS.\n\nThe reaction OP got was extreme and the company sounds very not inclusive.

New person started, we got on great, I invited her to coffee to get to know her and introduce her to the team, and we became friends. Colleague was jealous we got to know each other so we invited her to multiple things (small things like coffee, walking out to grab lunch etc) and got turned down every time.
