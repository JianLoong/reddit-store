Op is willingly participating in her roommate's idiocy, at least up until the point she texts him that the fun is over and she wants out of the stupid game. \n\nWhat he did was wrong, but it's just so wild to jump to him \"helping\" a random guy he doesn't even care about. Friend playing idiot immature matchmaker because he thinks Op might be into it, makes more sense to me.", "> I\u2019m also not excusing the roommate\u2019s actions by saying he didn\u2019t orchestrate a plan to have OP raped. \n\nCare to actual read what I\u2019m saying. You are screaming into a void, arguing with a straw man.", "NTA. This is straight-up icky, and he set you up. I'd look into somewhere else to live because there's a serious risk for SA here", "My pulse rate went up just reading this.  Your housemate is a giant AH, who put you at serious risk.  You had no recourse for retreat to your own room\u2026.this dude is literally on your bed! \nYour roommate decided it was more important to get some other guy laid than to protect you.  Keep away from him.  Full stop.", "I would have barged in my housemates room and dragged him out of bed and forced him to take that other guy home. No way I would have let that slide. Your housemate is an ass for doing that.....", "What the fuck did I just read? you need to get a new place and get away from this roommate asap", "Your housemate is toxic, abusive, sick to leave you in a possibly dangerous situation and then laugh about it.", "Girl, you in danger. This isn't something to shrug off as carelessness. He was setting you up for something they were all going to claim was consensual.", "I literally turned to my husband at the point where your roommate \"went to bed\" and was like \"omg! Listen to this sicko who set his roommate up to be alone with a guy who makes her uncomfortable!\" He agreed with my assessment and I hadn't even gotten to the part about him GOING INTO YOUR ROOM AND REFUSING TO LEAVE!!!", "Yeah.  Time to move out.", "(Eye roll) yup always the non comprehender...read a statement and can't fathom the meaning", "> But did her roommate know she wasn't interested?\n\nFirstly he literally had to because he helped set him up with this ridiculous situation rather than him just asking her out. He couldn't just ask her out because she'd already said no. NO one would ever help a guy out to this degree without first saying ask her out.\n\n>It just doesn't make sense that Op's good friend of three YEARS who DOESNT EVEN KNOW THIS GUY, was intentionally setting her up to get raped or intentionally trying to make her uncomfortable.\n\nyes it does, a lot of men see women as things to have sex with and see men as above women, which we have here. when she literally begged him to help get rid of a man lying on her bed who was refusing to leave he laughed and refused to help. IF a woman ever begs you to help remove the man they have no interest in and you laugh and ignore it, you say everything you need to about yourself.\n\nGuys constantly ask their women friends to just give some random guy a chance who they've already turned down. Saying shit like but he really likes you, and it wouldn't hurt to give him a chance, he's depressed or all manor of other excuses. A lot of men just think women should say yes to men and it's mean to not give them a chance.\n\n>Again, stupid, but they were also out there driving this random dude around as a fun adventure. Op is willingly participating in her roommate's idiocy, \n\nWhat are you talking about, OP was told this guy was stuck in a storm and needed a lift home, they were fine with that. AFTER he got in the car was when the stupidity started and it was at that point the room mate didn't simply state get out or give us the address, he said lets just go back to our place. This has nothing to do with OP, wasn't her choice and had no say in it. She was a willing participant? No she was lied to by room mate and this guy, how can you be a willing participant when you've been intentionally misled.\n\nLastly on the very slight off chance he didn't know OP wasn't interested, although again you've ignored that the room mate literally mentioned her new 'male friend' that she was seeing. The last thing you do is set up this guy to be alone in their house while he's supposedly drunk and NOT helping get rid of the guy when she asks him to. That's completely inappropriate regardless of the situation. It still puts her in an incredibly unsafe situation with no way out.", "Sometimes they come all in one even! Lol", "I find this ironic as the previous person who replied to your post stated what I'm about to say right now: in the post, OP says her housemate brought him, not her. I agree with your advice regarding the police. \n\n\nThat being said, you ARE victim blaming in the first part of your response. That's why I said what I said. I believed that you could have inferred that, but here we are.", "Read what I wrote"]}
