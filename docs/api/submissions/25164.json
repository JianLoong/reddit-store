Need help throwing your ex-housemate\u2019s shit onto the lawn?", "NTA and everything about this screams RAPE and your roomie not caring or helping you.  Get away from that roomie now and if ever someone won\u2019t give you their address then drop them off at the nearest police station or convenience store. And the fact that it\u2019s implied that you might be being \u201cgrumpy\u201d is so misogynistic and insulting!!!", "He wasn\u2019t allowing you to take care of yourself.  He was creating a situation intended to be unsafe for you and then leaving. Living with him is dangerous to your well being as he counters your own instincts and decisions and then leaves you in a place where you might be sexually assaulted. If this was about you handling things yourself, he would have stayed out of the situation.  Instead he joined the phone call.  He suggested bringing the guy back to your apartment, etc.  he was hoping your actual boyfriend would blow you off when you called him for help. Funny how your unwelcome and drunk guest sobered up real quick and left after all when your boyfriend was on the way.\n\nI would consider that your roommate and your old coworker are actually friends and have been in touch all along. You need to move away from that roommate. He is no friend", "NTA\u2026your housemate and drunk guy are.", "NTA\n\nOP you neeeeed to move out. Seriously, this roommate left you to be fucking assaulted.", "NTA obviously, I hope you find a new roommate ASAP", "NTA.  Time for a new housemate.  Your current one is trying to get you assaulted.", "NTA but your housemate is not your friend and they cannot be trusted.", "> He gets in the car and I immediately ask for his address and he refuses to give one. We keep driving around and I keep asking for an address. My housemate suggests he just come back to our house and he can get an Uber home from ours.\n\ngirl WHAT", "Speakerphone. \n\nYour housemate got you into it whether he was being a good guy or not. He definitely was not being a good guy to leave you, and he should have come to help when you were stuck. \n\nIt's like he was the drunk guy's wingman. Or was he yours? Did he read the situation to feel like a third wheel? But once you asked for help, he'd left a female friend alone with what one must assume is a potential predator (horny dude). \n\nPlus -- eff that guy. Going into your room after giving himself a tour? Red flags.", "NTA but your room mate is!  \nWhat if that guy tried to r\\*pe you? Would roomie have ignored your cries for help? Thank god your fella came over.\n\nGet out of there or find a new room mate. You're not safe there.", "NTA Call the cops next time.  Also, get some form of personal protection and a lock for your door that you lock every single night for when your housemate lets this guy in without telling you next time.", "I would have called the police immediately when he refused to get off my bed and leave.

Get away from him as soon as you can!", "If I were you, I\u2019d make a point about how creepy it was and after taking advice, you\u2019ve filed a police report and they said they\u2019ll escort him out next time. Yes it\u2019s a lie but hopefully your housemate realizes he set you up to be assaulted. Then arrange to leave as discretely as possible.", "This is straight up insane", "Jesus this subreddit is fucking insane", "No, it would actually be a really bad idea to call them, at least in the US. If the other roommate is ok with the guy being there they\u2019ll just write it off as a personal disagreement among friends.", "Im so sorry for what you went through and disgusted with your female roommate.", "If he saw you as a sister the last thing he would do is set you up for sex", "Maybe the drunk guy can move in", "She was on phone with the drunk colleague. What's the point of taking a colleague's call so late knowing he tried to hit on you in past? Even if you take it, why put it on speaker and invite flatmate to get involved as if it's some late night game", "[removed]", "Agree...not victim blaming....but you should have never taken him to your place....obviously he should have not done anything he did...so dont take this like a reprimamd..but as a future advise...if he wouldnt give you an address..drop him off at the police station or with a patroling officer....they can handle it...never bring random drunk people back to your house to help them out.", "I don't think you realize how common these set ups are for women or how often these actually are succesful attempts.", "Depending on the vampire lore, some are even easier to get rid of than this dude.  In True Blood, you can rescind their invitation and they're essentially forced out immediately. That would be so handy for unwanted guests.", "Yes but she may not have a had a choice because if she hadn\u2018t told him her friend was coming over, he more than likely would have raped her. Guess it\u2019s the lesser of the two evils. I don\u2019t know legal wise if her bedroom would be considered her space and not the mutual housemate\u2019s but I hope OP can get away from this roommate because he will try this shit again. OP keep your door locked (if possible), carry mace or other protective measure until  you get away from this roommate. Speak to the landlord about your options if you can. I and I\u2019m sure fellow Reddit posters are VERY CONCERNED for your safety. Please update us if you wish. Prayers \ud83d\ude4f for your safety!", "I swear, I have a little sister who isn't sister by blood, but if she texted me I'd do anything to help. Roommate is a bad guy and I fear was in on it.", "honestly i would put a call like that on speaker as that might make me feel safer, again she previously had a very close relationship with the male roommate so i\u2019m assuming, yes, that could have something to do with it. i think the questions should probably lie more with the two men in the situation. she shouldn\u2019t have to think twice about answering a late night call from a drunk acquaintance who hit on her in the past because he should not have any malicious intent or desire to assault her once she has already rejected him. it feels a lil weird for you to be so focused on her answering a call i\u2019m sure plenty of people would have answered, that doesn\u2019t make her deserving of the situation that ensued which i\u2019ll give the benefit of the doubt that you may not be intending to imply but will let you know is absolutely the way your comments are reading. also she wasn\u2019t the one who turned it into some \u201cgame\u201d simply by having the phone on speaker, per her comment once her roommate offered to pick him up HE posed to HER that it would be like any other late night adventure they had gone on.", "Thank GI\u2019d he didn\u2019t try to rape her because he prob would have stayed in his room even if she was screaming for help.", "Ok but I don\u2019t see anywhere that remotely suggest that the roommate is \u201cin on it\u201d or that an attempted rape happened.\n\nWas it creepy? Yes.  Is the roommate an asshole for leaving? Yes.\n\nBut what the person I\u2019m responding to is claiming is absolutely unfounded given the information we have and makes the most extreme assumptions possible, presenting them as fact."]}
