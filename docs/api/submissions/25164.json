For context, neither of us really know him on a personal level, we\u2019d both consider him an acquaintance, but, about 2 years ago he tried to hook up with me.\n\nI had this guy on speaker, my housemate said hi to him and started having a chat. He said he didn\u2019t have a lift home and was stuck in a storm 20 mins from our house. My housemate offered him a lift home and he took him up on it so we both went to pick him up.\n\nHe gets in the car and I immediately ask for his address and he refuses to give one. We keep driving around and I keep asking for an address. My housemate suggests he just come back to our house and he can get an Uber home from ours.\n\nSo we get back to our house, and we\u2019re all sitting on the couch. It\u2019s a bit of awkward conversation and after about 30 mins my housemate decides he\u2019s going to bed and leaves me alone with this guy. \n\nIt was pretty obvious this guy had no intention of leaving and started making himself at home by taking himself on a house tour (we live in a townhouse, I\u2019m downstairs and my housemate is upstairs). The guy arrives at my bedroom, I asked him not to go in there, he doesn\u2019t listen and decides to lay down on my bed. I asked him to get off my bed and he said no, then I asked when he was going home and he just moaned.\n\nI texted my house mate asking why he would just leave me like that and he responded saying \u201cHAHA sorry I couldn\u2019t take it anymore\u201d. I told him he wasn\u2019t leaving and instead of offering to help (he\u2019s 6ft 6 and pretty intimidating), he asked if a guy I was newly seeing (28M) at the time could come over and help, despite him living 20 mins away and it being 2am.\n\nMy housemate stopped replying to me and thankfully my guy friend came over straight away. As soon as I told the drunk guy that another guy was coming over, he left within 2 mins.\n\nI told my housemate the next day that what he did was really uncool and he justified it by saying I\u2019m not delicate and can take care of myself.\n\nAITA for being grumpy at my housemate for leaving me alone with the drunk guy?

Your roommate put you in soooooooo much danger, I literally cringed in horror reading that. It's deeply frustrating when some men (especially ones that are 6'6\") are so willfully obtuse about the danger women feel about strangers, and how many of us have been harassment, stalked, abused, raped, etc. To leave you alone in your home with a drunk man who once tried to hook up with you and then laid down in your bed...... on my god. I'm so glad your friend was able to come over and get him to leave. I hate your roommate for doing this to you.", "NTA.\n\nYour house mate was in on it. I don't know if they literally planned it earlier, or he just went along, but he 100% knew this guy was trying to sleep with you, that you weren't into it, and it would upset you. The comment about your \"male friend\" screams jealously.\n\nGet a new house mate, and the next time a guy won't leave, call the police.", "NTA you didn't offer to pick him up, your housemate did. You didn't offer for him to come over, your housemate did. He should not have left you alone with a virtual stranger and should have offered to help get him out of your room at the very least. If it was me, I would not have come along to pick him up and I would have locked myself in my room the second he showed up at the house lol. \n\nIt isn't about you being delicate, it's about common manners. Plus, I would never leave my girl friends with a drunk guy she barely knows who calls her up when he is drunk.", "NTA\n\nIt was actually something that could have escalated quite badly, thankfully it didn't. \n\nHow well do you know your roommate? Are you supposed to be close friends? This is a jerk move by any guy who's decent, even more so someone who's meant to be a friend/care about you to some extent.\n\nI'd be telling him that it is a big deal, you won't have him belittle that, and if he doesn't accept that then he's not someone you feel you can trust to have your back.", "I would be so pissed off at him.  He basically left you to be raped.  NTA at all", "NTA.  I had a similar situation once (and handled it the same way you did).  Don't ever feel guilty for protecting your personal space.", "NTA you could have actually been in danger from this guy", "NTA\n\nThis is so not cool. This is so wrong. You need a new housemate. I would not trust this guy anymore. He left you in a situation where you could have been seriously hurt. Nope nope nope!", "NTA he left you in a dangerous situation and laughed then shrugged it off.  You are not safe living with this man.", "NTA. And don't trust your housemate with anything ever. What he did was not only \"uncool\", it was borderline dangerous. You don't have to be grumpy, but you have to be cautious and know that he is capable of setting you up.", "NTA. At best you\u2019re a babysitter in this situation. At worst you could have been victimized. Your roommate is a dick.", "Nta", "NTA. But you need a new roommate, and in such a situation you should absolutely call the police.", "Thats insane and disgusting behavior of your housemate (and the other guy too obviously)", "NTA - this has red flags all over. Please move out as soon as possible, I don't think you are safe living with this guy.", "See if you can break your lease and move out ASAP. Your roommate left you in a vulnerable situation deliberately. He\u2019s not your friend nor does he have any kind of care for you. You could have been raped and that may have even been the plan.", "Call your roommate's mother. (Or sister. Or grandmother.) Bet they'll have a thing or two to say about his actions.\n\nNTA", "NTA!

And that all male guests will be out by 11 p.m. or some such. Because that should never ever happen to you again. He was irresponsible and ridiculous and put you in bodily harm.

I initially just felt pissed off that my roommate left me to deal with this guy, just generally speaking.

My reaction was just shock because he knew I\u2019d started seeing someone and he seemed to really like him", "It did all seem a bit too convenient- the address refusal and uber suggestion felt off.", "hard agree. this was a setup", "Normally I would\u2019ve just stayed home in my room but my housemate and I were already hanging out and it was posed like a little late night adventure (which is commons for us). Safe to say I won\u2019t be doing that again", "We\u2019ve been pretty much like brother/sister for a few years and that\u2019s what shocked me so much about his actions.

Ill only hang out in groups with you then the group disappears...  \n\n\nAbsolutely a set up - and even if not - your housemate left you when you had communicated you did not feel safe, and even when you requested assistance just laughed. That is not ok. I can take care of myself - but someone using my been a feminist to not assist me when I need it? not ok.", "NTA \n\nNext time just call the police directly after the first refusal - wheather  it's to give the address - drop him off in front of a police station - or to leave your home - call the police to get him out. \n\nAnd warn your roommate that if he's such an ah again you will press charges for facilitating a drunk and disorderly and he has 0 say in what you do or who you hook up with or don't hook up with. He has endangered you by bringing that ah in your home.", "a guy wandering in and laying down on your bed is standard boundary pushing ah who for some reason thinks this will get him laid. nta, your roommate and the creep are. if he pulls anything like this again, you\u2019re gonna need a new roommate.", "Op, YOU may feel the bond is like brother/sister but from this situation you learned HE does NOT care for you like a brother would. He put you in danger and didn\u2019t see it. I would not trust him for one bit after this. Be carefull.", "This man entered your room when you told him not to. He laid down on your bed and didn\u2019t get up when you asked him to. He refused to leave when asked multiple times. Clearly, this is a man who either doesn\u2019t understand the concept of \u201cno\u201d, or doesn\u2019t care. He demonstrated that fully. This could have easily escalated into a sexual assault. Your roommate needs to get that through his thick head.", "People always say a relationship like brother and sister. But it\u2019s not. This is a perfect example. None of my mates ever pulled anything like this with my sister and if I wasn\u2019t around I could count on them to look after her if she was in an uncomfortable situation", "This housemate is not your friend and he sees you as a toy he can pass to his friends for their enjoyment. Your housemate only pretends to be your friend so they can manipulate you and place you in vulnerable circumstances for his friends amusement. \n\nStay away from this housemate and get cameras installed in your bedroom but also look to move out immediately. Your housemate believes their friends has more rights to use your body than your right to your own body autonomy.", "It's not an excuse, but unfortunately men can be kinda dense, assuming women are just exaggerating and playing victim with our stories of things going badly for us or women we know. \n\nIt's a bad sign and speaks poorly of your roommate that it took the opinion of another man, one who he barely knows compared to you since you've only just started seeing the dude, to actually hear what you're saying. \n\nWhether you continue to bring it up with him or not, know you are definitely NTA and I would definitely reassess how much you value this friendship and can trust this friend, maybe he needs to just be a roommate essentially, he's definitely not mature enough to be friends with a woman in the type of world we live in today unless his views change."]}
