I have a daughter (25f) with my late former husband and my current husband has a daughter (22f) from his previous marriage. My husband divorced his ex about 7 years because she was a \"lazy manipulative bitch\" (his words).\n\nUnfortunately, my stepdaughter seems to have followed in her mother's footsteps. Ever since I came into the picture, she blamed me for ruining any chance of her dad and mom ever getting back together and behaved toxically. She regularly messed up all the rooms of the house. When I would tell her to clean it up, she gave me the cliched \"you're not my mom\" spiel. Whenever her dad declined to give her something, she would cry crocodile tears or throw a tantrum until he gave in. She would also tell lies about me. She was a nightmare. When she turned 19, my husband finally had enough and kicked her out. It's been 3 years since and her behavior seems to be improving a little bit but things are still tense between her and me. Fortunately, I don't have to see her on a daily basis so I can live with it.\n\nBoth my daughter and stepdaughter have children of their own. My daughter has a 2 year old girl with her husband while my stepdaughter has a 1 year old son with her boyfriend. My daughter wants to save up for a house with her husband so she asked me if I could babysit while she works. I was fine with that. I have a part-time wfh job so I agreed to do it.\n\nMy stepdaughter found out about this arrangement a few days ago called me to ask if I could do the same for her child. She couldn't ask her bio mom because she lives in another state. I just said no. It's not that I hate her kid. It's because one child is a handful already and I don't want to give up my job which I enjoy doing.  She kept probing but I still gave her the same response. She then tried to emotionally manipulate me by asking if I loved my bio daughter more than her. I flipped it on her and asked her if she loved her bio mom more than me, she said \"yeah because she's my mom\". So I told her that I likewise love my bio daughter more than her because she's my daughter. When she heard that she lost her shit and started calling me a bunch of names. I just cut the call and blocked her number.\n\nMy husband is on my side but says I shouldn't have indulged in her nonsense. I see where he's coming from but she's an adult and if she wants to play stupid games, then she deserves stupid prizes. I don't owe her any favors after how she's behaved and treated me over the years but I'm wondering if I shouldn't have said what I said.

She never wanted anything to do with you and actually went out of her way to make living together miserable for you. I appreciate that she will have her side of the story, but when a child is this old when first introduced to a step parent, and moreover, she still has her own mother, plus her attitude of trying everything to push you out of the home/relationship with her dad, you don't owe her free childcare on a regular basis. She hasn't even apologised for her years of appalling behaviour, and now that she wants something from you she knows where to find you. Nahh, she's just salty she gets no free help from you. Suggest that she ask her dad? Or, she could have thought about how much help she would need and figure out if she has the local network for that BEFORE she chose to get pregnant at only 20-21.", "Nta but your husband is. He should have nipped that behavior in the bud while she was still a minor and should have told her it\u2019s unacceptable to behave that way.

The question may make it sound like but you provided enough info to believe NTA and I personally would have said the same. Stand your ground.

The whole situation is sad, but she should not have expected you to do her a favor as big as the one she was asking you considering the relationship the two of you have.

You're the one with all the power and you need to grow up. You clearly hate your stepchild and somehow expect her to like you when you talk about her like this.", "NTA. You answered too clearly. A simple, what do you think? Would have worked better. Then you could deny it.", "NTA\n\nThat's easy. You owe her absolutely nothing, especially when she tried to make your life miserable, and I believe later she didn't say or do anything to at least try to make up for that (I know nothing can, really, but a genuine attempt of redemption would do no harm, right?).

You seriously said that to your stepdaughter?  You know you're the AH for that.

It would be different if you were there to help raise your stepdaughter and got married to her father when she was like 6, but she was 2 years from being an adult when you married her father. It's unrealistic to except some emotional bond to just happen at the drop of the hat, so the comments being like \"wow you just said you loved one daughter over the other\" are ridiculous.\n\nAlso, your reasoning is very sound and makes sense for not wanting to babysit her child as well. You still have a life and you've done your part raising kids already, why should you be forced to raise more? And she absolutely cannot get mad at you for having the same logic she does. She accused you of loving her less while also admitting she loves you less but still expects you to babysit her kid?\n\nAs for your husband, I'm sorry but he should have stepped in from the very beginning. He shouldn't have given in every time she threw a tantrum when you two first got married.

Occasionally, it's easier to have 2 + kids around to entertain each other while you do things around the house/for your job (depending on the grandkids ages).

OPs husband was entitled to find love and get married again, even if his 16 year old didnt like it. No adult was an AH here, and I wont even call the stepdaughter a true AH as a teen, although from what we know her behavior was atrocious... she was a kid who was struggling, even tho no one was wronging her, being a teen with divorced parents can be hard. At 22, she doesnt get a pass anymore tho. Actions have consequences, end of story."]}
