I have a daughter (25f) with my late former husband and my current husband has a daughter (22f) from his previous marriage. My husband divorced his ex about 7 years because she was a \"lazy manipulative bitch\" (his words).\n\nUnfortunately, my stepdaughter seems to have followed in her mother's footsteps. Ever since I came into the picture, she blamed me for ruining any chance of her dad and mom ever getting back together and behaved toxically. She regularly messed up all the rooms of the house. When I would tell her to clean it up, she gave me the cliched \"you're not my mom\" spiel. Whenever her dad declined to give her something, she would cry crocodile tears or throw a tantrum until he gave in. She would also tell lies about me. She was a nightmare. When she turned 19, my husband finally had enough and kicked her out. It's been 3 years since and her behavior seems to be improving a little bit but things are still tense between her and me. Fortunately, I don't have to see her on a daily basis so I can live with it.\n\nBoth my daughter and stepdaughter have children of their own. My daughter has a 2 year old girl with her husband while my stepdaughter has a 1 year old son with her boyfriend. My daughter wants to save up for a house with her husband so she asked me if I could babysit while she works. I was fine with that. I have a part-time wfh job so I agreed to do it.\n\nMy stepdaughter found out about this arrangement a few days ago called me to ask if I could do the same for her child. She couldn't ask her bio mom because she lives in another state. I just said no. It's not that I hate her kid. It's because one child is a handful already and I don't want to give up my job which I enjoy doing.  She kept probing but I still gave her the same response. She then tried to emotionally manipulate me by asking if I loved my bio daughter more than her. I flipped it on her and asked her if she loved her bio mom more than me, she said \"yeah because she's my mom\". So I told her that I likewise love my bio daughter more than her because she's my daughter. When she heard that she lost her shit and started calling me a bunch of names. I just cut the call and blocked her number.\n\nMy husband is on my side but says I shouldn't have indulged in her nonsense. I see where he's coming from but she's an adult and if she wants to play stupid games, then she deserves stupid prizes. I don't owe her any favors after how she's behaved and treated me over the years but I'm wondering if I shouldn't have said what I said.

She never wanted anything to do with you and actually went out of her way to make living together miserable for you. I appreciate that she will have her side of the story, but when a child is this old when first introduced to a step parent, and moreover, she still has her own mother, plus her attitude of trying everything to push you out of the home/relationship with her dad, you don't owe her free childcare on a regular basis. She hasn't even apologised for her years of appalling behaviour, and now that she wants something from you she knows where to find you. Nahh, she's just salty she gets no free help from you. Suggest that she ask her dad? Or, she could have thought about how much help she would need and figure out if she has the local network for that BEFORE she chose to get pregnant at only 20-21.", "Nta but your husband is.

You're the one with all the power and you need to grow up. You clearly hate your stepchild and somehow expect her to like you when you talk about her like this.", "NTA. You answered too clearly. A simple, what do you think? Would have worked better. Then you could deny it.", "NTA\n\nThat's easy. You owe her absolutely nothing, especially when she tried to make your life miserable, and I believe later she didn't say or do anything to at least try to make up for that (I know nothing can, really, but a genuine attempt of redemption would do no harm, right?).

You seriously said that to your stepdaughter?  You know you're the AH for that.

It would be different if you were there to help raise your stepdaughter and got married to her father when she was like 6, but she was 2 years from being an adult when you married her father. It's unrealistic to except some emotional bond to just happen at the drop of the hat, so the comments being like \"wow you just said you loved one daughter over the other\" are ridiculous.\n\nAlso, your reasoning is very sound and makes sense for not wanting to babysit her child as well. You still have a life and you've done your part raising kids already, why should you be forced to raise more? And she absolutely cannot get mad at you for having the same logic she does. She accused you of loving her less while also admitting she loves you less but still expects you to babysit her kid?\n\nAs for your husband, I'm sorry but he should have stepped in from the very beginning. He shouldn't have given in every time she threw a tantrum when you two first got married.

Occasionally, it's easier to have 2 + kids around to entertain each other while you do things around the house/for your job (depending on the grandkids ages).

I do believe both are in the wrong.", "Agree", "No, that isn\u2019t the point you made.  You said the OP is the asshole.  Where did you say both were?  My point is neither are in the right.  In order to know who is more of an asshole you would need to know more of the situation and both sides.", "If its wrong to treat the kids differently, than its wrong for SD to treat her mom and OP differently. \n\nAnd lets be clear her. It is SD who brought up being \"treated\" different. She asked if OP loved her daughter more than her.\n\nSD is being treated how she based on her actions, not biologiy. She has mistreated OP her entire life and is now coming to her asking a favor. Not wanting to make amends, but to get something from her. OP is not playing favorites, but has a relationship with SD based on SD own actions. \n\nSD was 16 when she meet her, and only lived with her 3 years, which were not good ones. Not much time, or willingness from SD, to form a child-parent relationship. So not treating her like her own child is understandable. And if SD is not her child, than the grandkid is not her grandkid either.", "Not gonna lie I did think I was posting a reply to a comment on an AITA about a woman not letting her MIL pick her wedding dress and saying her husband screamed at her because it's his mum's day too. Must have hit scroll and seen this one, apologies.", "Jesus. Why are we in on the husband. He did what almost all parents do during a divorce.", "In which case this subreddit would have roasted him for it. Poor guy can\u2019t win, accept and hold the daughter accountable for her actions or discipline her, you decide he is an asshat.", "It's not even knowing one kid longer than the other. It's about the kind of relationship they have, and the treatment from SD towards OP. \n\n\"You're not my mom\" turns to \"I need help and we're family\" real quick.", "That's usually how it is with stepparents on this sub. Always demonized and told they shouldn't try to be an authority figure or second parent to their stepkid, and when they do that, they're accused of not loving the stepkid and wanting them out of the picture.\n\nOr they DO try to build a relationship and they're berated for overstepping BoUnDaRiEs or \"forcing\" a relationship.\n\nStepparents are only there to serve as emotional punching bags and nothing else.", "I agree about her wanting OP to spell it out.  Based on how OP described the daughters past behavior, i feel like the daughter got the ammo she needed to turn around and  manipulate her father into either forcing help or  more likely to giving her money for childcare instead.", "This is now my new response when I'm asked this question by my hubs and kids (i respect their no, but i thrive on screwing with them lmao)\n\n\nThank you for this golden ammo!!", "She is 22 with a kid. She is solidly entered into adulthood with all the responsibilities, pain and truth that involves. She got a dose of truth and didn\u2019t like how it tasted.", "She is 22.", "Sure. But let's not forget the ex wife. If daughter was with her 90% of the time do we really need to sit here and go at the husband? \n\nHe kicked her out at 19 and her behavior has been improving. Maybe there was counseling. \n\nMaybe this is on the adult daughter to not act like this.", "God forbid OP lose her patience with this person after 6 years of shit treatment.", ">I think it says a lot about OP, honestly.\n\nYeah, that she's not a doormat.", "1. Can you quote 2 lines from OP where they put themselves out as being a \"great potential mom\"? They didn't really say anything about their parental skills at all.\n\n\n\n2. People are allowed to feel ways about their exes. My partner has told me her ex was a manipulative, jealous asshole. And from other people, it's a pretty accurate assessment. Why should I judge her for telling me this? Doesn't make her look bad to me at all, and only thing it says about her is that she made a poor choice of partner before.", "How old are you out of curiosity? Because 18 year olds aren\u2019t even remotely adults let alone 16 year olds", "I was trying to say that the step daughter getting kicked out is directly related to OP, since (according to OP) she was kicked out as retaliation for her behavior towards OP. \n\nYou're right that my phrasing does suggest a bit more responsibility on OP's part than can be strictly deduced from her account.", "As you say though, none of those things matter because OP isn't obliged to offer free daycare.", "She asked the step mother she rejected for help as soon as she realised it was an option because she felt like she was missing out. Yeah that\u2019s greedy.", "This is reddit. Everything is gaslighting and every story is simultaneously true and false.", "You make some good points and I'll amend my position a bit, but I want to start by saying that I don't hold the \"children\" to same standards as the \"parents\" regarding fairness and everything. The parents are supposed to be the mature teachers, they're supposed to know what's right, and they're the ones that had a choice in the relationship, the kids didn't.\n.\n.\nbut yeah you do make some good points and I should try to make it clear that I know parents sometimes treat kids a little differently, and sometimes it's reasonable, sometimes they deserve it even. But it's not perfectly ethical, and people shouldnt feel perfectly comfortable about it...its complicated. But this is simple, the grandkids definitely don't deserve to be treated differently just because of how their mom acts. And idk if you're just quoting the SD or if you think biological kids should be treated differently, but either way I don't share that sentiment, and just because SD was rude enough to say that stuff, doesn't give OP excuse to do it. Though Im not trying to like put rules on how and who she babysits (that's another layer of complication here), obviously OP can spend their free time how they choose, but, as I've been emphasizing: I just don't think people should feel perfectly comfortable or justified choosing to treat their kids differently.", "[removed]", "I know, it's just that often, stepparents get flamed for not loving and treating their stepkids as they love and treat their own, no matter how the kids in question treat them or how different the lifestyles of the kids are (defined by the lifestyle of the other bio parent), so I didn't go into that because stepdaughter herself defined this part of the relationship in her answer.", "But it wasn't even like a family event with simmering shots fired over the dinner table. A phone call is pretty fucking easy to disconnect \ud83d\ude06", "In most countries 18 is the age of majority", "18 are adults in the overwhelming majority of countries.", "I mean that's fair - I do think though that OP isn't to blame for / in control of how the SD treated her or her husbands feelings about it. She may even have been against kicking the daughter out. So saying OP played a major role may be a bit unfair, given it might not have been her actions at all. It could have been that any woman in that position would have been disliked by the SD because the SD was processing a lot of heavy feelings", "Exactly. \"Your not my mom\" should not quickly turn into \"i need help and support and your my family\" for materialistic gain.  If you claim I'm nothing to you and not family, don't expect me to act like family does in times of need.", "It might help me to explain my position and perception better if I say that I think step daughter should be mature enough to understand and accept that OP is providing babysitting service to help her daughter succeed in life and that asking OP to do the same for her would either result in the other daughter not getting as much childcare service or it would mean OP would have to do tice as much work and without any pay, and SD shouldnt want to put OP in such a position. I understand SD is being an immature brat, and maybe I shouldn't have said OP is more wrong...but still, my main position is that OP shouldn't feel perfectly comfortable or justified treating their kids and grandkids so differently, even if they feel it's appropriate or necessary they should still feel bad about it. Which I think is a feeling parents have pretty often, feeling bad about something they did to their kids even though they thought it was appropriate or necessary.", "This. Stepdaughter can\u2019t have it both ways. Either stepmom is family (and is treated much better) or stepmom isn\u2019t and has no obligation.", "At 22, she's an adult. And for things to be fair, she has 2 living parents who can help her. OP's daughter has one.", "Still young. Still hurtful. Still unkind."]}
