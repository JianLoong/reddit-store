However, this is the type of guy that likely had everything done for him at home. He is not likely to change. His parent(s) may have instilled in him that women are supposed to take care of men.

Starting cleaning only your and the kitten\u2019s messes. For example, use paper plates and cups and fork so you never have to do the dishes. Clean the pans you use to cook but don\u2019t dare cook for him. Only do your laundry and only clean your mess in the bathroom and put all your stuff in a clean drawer.

Your boyfriend sounds lazy.", "Echoing all the people above who are saying to only cook for yourself going forward. Do not clean any of his messes.

You are the new \u2018mom\u2019 stand in but he also doesn\u2019t want to give the original Mom up either. His expectations are being met by her and you to this point so he has no reason or motivation to change. I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon. I would tell him that if he lives there he has to contribute to all tasks equally. If he doesn\u2019t like cooking, that\u2019s a task you take on but he then takes on another. If he can\u2019t agree to that he can move home to mommy where he clearly feels most comfortable as all his stuff is there. You have to instigate him to make a choice, but be prepared it likely won\u2019t be the one you won\u2019t.
