A truck had dropped a dolly in the road during morning rush hour traffic, and my dad had just gotten off of work. It was on a 4-lane stretch of I-35, my dad and the truck that dropped the dolly were in the second-from-the-left-lane (aka the 2nd fastest travel speed lane). Everybody in front of my dad slammed on their brakes, and in my dad's knee-jerk reaction, only slammed on his front motorcycle breaks going easily 65+ mph.\n\nNeedless to say, he went over the handlebars and his bike fell over. The only two things that saved my dad in that situation?\n\nA. His helmet\nB. His gun\n\nHe slid on his gun into the left-most lane of traffic and had to very quickly continue rolling to his left towards the concrete median to narrowly avoid getting run over and killed. I remember my mom sounding so panicked in the kitchen while I was getting ready for school, and she shoved me in the car after calling my teacher and letting him know I wouldn't be in class that day, and I would need to make up our spelling test that day next week. Seeing my dad bruised up, with his uniform all torn up from sliding on the pavement draped over the chair in the hospital was a very scary thing to 4th grade me (honestly, the only reason I remember all this shit so well). Thank the powers that be that he only came away with bruises and a broken bone in his thumb that had to be reset with plates and pins. He sold his bike not long after that incident.\n\nAll that being said, I'm sure you're a wonderful and safe motorcyclist, but shit can still happen.

Sorry not everyone can grasp that. My point was I know people in the medical field as well. They ride, they don't have problems with their loved ones riding. Is it dangerous? Absolutely. I'm not in denial of that. But there are many things in this world that are dangerous. So the argument is that. Give up those things for their significant other, or child, whatever, come back in ten years and say the same thing on how great it was to give them up. I know more people who regret or have distain for their loved ones after doing that.  It happens more than not whether some admit it or not.
