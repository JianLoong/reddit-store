You\u2019re so damn vulnerable on a motorcycle!", ">she should have brought this up back when we decided to start trying for a kid.\n\nNTA because you're right that she should have mentioned this was a dealbreaker for her.  Not sure what she means by \"not budging\" though---is she saying she will break off your relationship?\n\nShe's not wrong about the general \"concern\" around a new parent having dangerous hobbies.", "Info: Do you have life insurance?", "NAH, but you're not the most important person in your life anymore. You have a responsibility to your daughter to not die in a stupid motorcycle accident.", "ESH I mean, yes she should have known to clear this up when you were both trying for a pregnancy but I also would be terrified of becoming a widow single parent if my partner rode a motorcycle so I can empathize with her.  All I ever hear from my hospital friends is how often they see these accidents and how horrific they are. Good luck!", "NAH Look, motorcycles are arguably more dangerous then a car but it\u2019s also your choice to do what you want with your life, just Atleast make sure you\u2019re riding with motorcycle protective gear.", "my father sold his 63 mg after my sister was born . sad , but he knew the car wasn't safe and would never put himself in harms way over a silly vehicle . sounds like you have it all figured out though . YTA .", "INFO: Do you have a lot of Short- and Long-term Disability insurance coverage? A lot of Life insurance? And an emergency fund? If yes, ride on, my friend. If you don't have all 3 of them, get them all or don't ride until the kid is 18. I'm not kidding. Bad stuff is way more likely to happen on a bike vs a car. You have a family to support now. How are you gonna do that if you can't work for 6 months because some dumbass in a car turned left in front of you?\n\nSource: biker who spent 6 months on full and 6 months on partial disability after crash. If I didn't have a big ass emergency fund and good insurance, I'd be bankrupt. Shit happens.", "NTA but I would still cave and sell it if I were you.\n\nI was in the same boat with my wife. She is an emergency nurse and she gets the remains of motorcycle accidents almost daily. I say remains because there's not much left.\n\nI have all the same excuses you do but I learned that everyone of them was pushing my own selfish agenda. When I looked at it I know seven people that have died or have permanent damage from a motorcycle accident. Everyone I know has similar numbers.\n\n I've been riding motor cycles without an accident for 20 years. While I am an amazing driver, you can't claim that for everyone. Eventually someone will be a dumbass.\n\nIt's a little different if you're in a car/truck. They are better designed to keep you safe. A motorcycle has none of the bells and whistles. If you get into an accident it is much more severe.", "ESH. My father spent the first year of my life in a wheelchair after a lady blew through a stop sign and wrecked his bike. Is that what you want for your first year of fatherhood?", "ESH. 99.9% of the time, it would be ridiculous of her to all of the sudden tell you what to do and say she\u2019s \u201cnot budging\u201d as if she has a say\u2026. But a motorcycle? The data is clear as day: you\u2019re begging to make her a widow, sole caretaker of this kid, and make your to-be child a fatherless one. That\u2019s just the reality.  So yes, when you\u2019re aware of that reality, it makes you an AH being a father-to-be playing with death and risking leaving them alone. \n\nShe should have made her thoughts more clear before getting pregnant instead of springing this on you. That\u2019s what makes her the AH.", "NAH. She would have been TA if it was just the two of you, but things change when there's a dependent involved.", "NAH - she shouldn't have sprung it on you like that, but she does have a point that it is a very dangerous hobby. I was raised by a wonderful father, but biologically I am his best friend's kid. He was run down while riding his motorcycle while my mother was pregnant with me. Please take her concerns into consideration.", "ESH. Her for acting like she has power over you, and you for not considering her very legitimate concern. Check the stats some time, you'll see why hospital and morgue workers consider motorcycles the kiss of death.", "NAH I get where she\u2019s coming from and where you\u2019re coming from. It\u2019s kinda funny my husband and I each have something that we think is unnecessarily dangerous. We kinda let it go as each was important to the other and now just morbidly joke above each others life insurance policy\u2019s.", "NTA but...! Please make sure you always wear the proper protective gear and have decent life insurance for her and your child. That's not to sound dramatic, it's just more responsible. And while the insurance obviously could never replace you, it would help them and it may help her feel slightly more comfortable with it. I say this as a wife (of 30 years) whose husband is an adrenaline junkie and loves all dangerous things. He rides a Honda CBR, he's an airline pilot, and he was trained as a race car driver. So he is the human incarnation of \"dangerous\". The thing is, I knew that before we married and raised our four kids. Also, I did ask him to sign a contract for riding his motorcycle, as part of accepting his marriage proposal. It states those conditions I mentioned, and also that he will observe safe traffic laws. Having said that, I know he breaks the speeding rule I requested, but luckily he's still with us after those 30 years. Still, I'm currently trying to bribe him with a new 2023 Corvette, to replace the motorcycle. But so far he's only halfheartedly considering it. LOL. Best wishes.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 100% right, it's not her call to make, especially since you're not even married (and even if you were, it still wouldn't be her choice)!\n\nYou should take this as a wake-up call to have discussion on other things too before the kid comes.  Like finances, how you plan to raise/parent it, last name, etc.  You're going to both have some tough decisions to make probably with a lot of compromises, so strap in tight!", "ESH\n\nY T A for telling us the future mother of your child is \"sulking\" about you casually risking your life on the daily. Have some damn respect for the woman you CHOSE to impregnate.\n\nYeah, she should have brought it up before deciding to have kids with you. But in every other thread about parenting standoffs, people scream that \"kids change everything\" no matter what past agreements and promises were made about your individual wants. I say this as someone who rode and loved it: No one needs a motorcycle.\n\nEither way you're gonna be a dad and the pressing question is: How much life insurance do you have?", "YTA because you need to accept that your life does not just belong to you anymore.\n\nYou have a child and a girlfriend who is going to be depending on you for support, and you are out riding a crotch-rocket.\n\n10 years safe, that means that tomorrow will be safe?\n\nSorry, YTA.\n\nYour wife doesn't want to be a single mother in deep poverty after your brains are rinsed from the blacktop, because you thought you still wanted and deserved freedom even though you made the active choice to bring another life into this world.", "NTA your girlfriend is allowed to not budge on her opinion, but that doesn't make it enforceable. How is she going to stop you? Does she have a gameplan?", "NTA.\n\nAs a child raised by two motorcyclists - who were riding well before I was born - I get her concern, but it's no different that someone who enjoy snowboarding. And honestly, every single accident my parents have been in in the last 50 years (only a few) have been in cars, never on their bike.\n\nAre there risks, absolutely. But if you're not one of the crotch-rocket riders, pay attention, and drive responsibly your chances of an accident are reduced.\n\nThat being said, her fears are not unfounded. It can be dangerous, and you really have to be understanding of that.", "NTA...She can't simply make these demands.  You're right, this should have been a discussion long before trying for a child.", "NTA - You're 100% right, this is something she should have brought up before trying to have a kid.", "Currently pregnant with baby number 2 and my husband has been in the motorcycle trade for the past 12 years and was riding for fun another 3 years prior since he was 16. It's an intrinsic part of who he is, it's been such a large part of his life for so long. After we had our first, I didn't ask him to give it up I just told him he has to ride completely safely and within the law. Which he has followed pretty well (except for when he sped to the hospital 10 weeks ago for a miscarriage scare) He used to ride like an arse when he was younger, but now he keeps our daughters at the forefront of his mind. \n\nNTA. Maybe discuss that you'll be safe and you'll take all safety measures. Regardless of what you do, the road isn't safe for motorcyclists, drivers, cyclists or pedestrians as there's always someone else who's stupid enough to think they deserve to be on the road.", "NTA. Yes, she should have thought about her concerns and voiced them before starting, no, you should not sell the motorcycle, because giving up on yourself doesn\u2019t make for complete parents.", "NTA. But I think a reasonable compromise would be for you to try to be extra careful?", "NTA - she knew already", "NTA\n\nYes, driving a motorcycle can be dangerous and, to an extend, I understand her concern. But I draw the line where her concern becomes an ultimatum. Nope, that's not how a healthy relationship works.\n\nBesides, if we look at stats, also bikes and cars are dangerous. Hell, sometimes just leaving your house by foot is dangerous. So what? Does she want to lock you up?", "NTA. If this was the first time she mentioned it, right after getting pregnant, it looks like maybe she deliberately waited to get pregnant first, so she'd have more leverage to make you get rid of it. \n\nBut... It may just be her hormones talking, so if she's not usually very manipulative and controlling, maybe she'd come around. Don't get rid of your bike.", "NTA. As long as you're being as safe as possible. That means a helmet and protective clothing at all times. Just be warned that Reddit collectively hates motorcycles, so you might get a lot of Y TA comments.", "NTA she shouldn't have waited until after she was pregnant, makes you wonder what other ultimations she will pop on you.", "NTA\n\nI know several parents with motorcycles, and they are responsible. It\u2019s an AH move for her to demand that, at the very least, she should have brought it up when discussing having kids and not attempt to trap you into doing so after she started carrying.", "NTA!! Can\u2019t become a hermit just because your having a child, any one of us could drop dead at anytime", "NTA. While motorcycles are more dangerous than cars. Anyone can lose their life in a hundred different ways everyday.", "NTA - \"How about No!\"\n\na lot of you sound like riding a motorcycle is like pouring gas on yourself & lighting it \n\nthat's a near-certain death sentence.", "In her extremely hormonal state all she wants is peace of mind.

It's all the cars that don't pay attention to bikes on the road.

What we need to be doing is finding a middle ground instead of arguing. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE HOBBIES AS A PARENT- despite misconception. Parents are people, too. Involved parents can also have hobbies... How else do they relax and keep themselves from burnout? Anyway, your girlfriend is obviously worried about you. She cares. This isn't the end of the world, and you shouldn't shame her for that. At the same time, it's not fair for her to tell you HAVE to sell your motorcycle. Yes, you guys should've talked about this prior to trying, but you didn't. So now what do you do? Be mad at each other and ruin the relationship? Or apologize to each other and find a middle ground?
