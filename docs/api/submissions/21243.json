When I cook I use very small amounts and generally don't buy something until I need it for a recipe. If I can get away with nabbing extra packets at restaurants I prefer doing that. The only condiment I ever really have on hand besides salt and pepper is mayo since I use it for sandwiches and mixing some different salads.\n\nThat is pretty much what led to my issue. I'm finally renting a house all on my own. I was excited that I could have my family and a couple of friends over all at the same time without having roommates to worry about so invited everyone over for dinner. I grilled up some chicken and fish, did some shrimp, veggies, and some baked potatoes. Once we started eating they were asking for things like tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, hot sauce, sour cream, ranch- just all these things that they should know I don't readily keep on hand. I told them I had made a dipping sauce for the shrimp so they could just use that for anything else because it's pretty good. My brother said he had tried it but didn't like it and things like cocktail sauce and tartar sauce are pretty basic staples to have around if you eat any kind of seafood and I told him he should've brought some instead of expecting me to waste money on something that'll just sit in my fridge.\n\nLast night our mother called me and told me I need to think about my guests if I'm going to invite people over. I told her I had already cooked for everyone, and expecting anything more was a bit much. The gist of the rest of our conversation was her basically telling me a good host that invites people over picks up drinks or a couple of condiments that they know their guests like or are likely to use. And that if it was a cost or waste issue, I should\u2019ve asked them to bring some when I invited them.\n\nI said I just won't host anything else at my house and hung up. But now I've had time to think about it and it wouldn't have been a lot cost wise but I still don't think I have any obligation to provide that kind of stuff for people that I've already gone out of my way to cook for. AITA here Reddit?\n\nEdit: Seasonings that you cook with and condiments you add to food are NOT the same thing. All the food was seasoned with things like lemon juice, garlic salt, dill, Creole seasonings, things like that. I made a Cajun buttermilk dipping sauce for the fish and shrimp, and there were things they could've put on their baked potatoes (butter, chives chopped bacon) just not any sour cream or ranch.", "created_utc": 1688401679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pnqif/aita_for_not_providing_condiments_for_my_guests/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if you really can't or don't want to buy those, you can simply make it a BYOB/bring your preferred dressings thing.

If you didn't stock *everything* people might want then that is fine, but to grill chicken and shrimp and not have pretty standard condiments like hot sauce, bbq sauce, etc is not being very hospitable.

When I cook I use very small amounts and generally don't buy something until I need it for a recipe. If I can get away with nabbing extra packets at restaurants I prefer doing that. The only condiment I ever really have on hand besides salt and pepper is mayo since I use it for sandwiches and mixing some different salads.\r  \n\r  \nThat is pretty much what led to my issue. I'm finally renting a house all on my own. I was excited that I could have my family and a couple of friends over all at the same time without having roommates to worry about so invited everyone over for dinner. I grilled up some chicken and fish, did some shrimp, veggies, and some baked potatoes. Once we started eating they were asking for things like tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, hot sauce, sour cream, ranch- just all these things that they should know I don't readily keep on hand. I told them I had made a dipping sauce for the shrimp so they could just use that for anything else because it's pretty good. My brother said he had tried it but didn't like it and things like cocktail sauce and tartar sauce are pretty basic staples to have around if you eat any kind of seafood and I told him he should've brought some instead of expecting me to waste money on something that'll just sit in my fridge.\r  \n\r  \nLast night our mother called me and told me I need to think about my guests if I'm going to invite people over. I told her I had already cooked for everyone, and expecting anything more was a bit much. The gist of the rest of our conversation was her basically telling me a good host that invites people over picks up drinks or a couple of condiments that they know their guests like or are likely to use. And that if it was a cost or waste issue, I should\u2019ve asked them to bring some when I invited them.\r  \n\r  \nI said I just won't host anything else at my house and hung up. But now I've had time to think about it and it wouldn't have been a lot cost wise but I still don't think I have any obligation to provide that kind of stuff for people that I've already gone out of my way to cook for.

Or even send them home with people, if you don't want to be wasteful.", "Lol but op doesn't have the mayo or ketchup.", "Agreed! NTA OP!", "Omg the only sane person here. Maybe in the states it's different but we serve potato's different ways (roast, chips, baked) when we have bbq's and people don't have to have sour cream, bacon chives etc. The comments seem really weird. We.normally.put out tomato sauce for the kids and a chilli sauce and that's it. No one complains about the BBQ or the foods because you don't have sauce everything and is still really delicious as the meats have marinade etc on them.", "How is asking for a common condiment rude?", "you know - us Americans like to drown everything in ranch.", "\nThis was my thought. I can't imagine demanding a host have store-bought dipping sauce. She made a nice sauce. It's a new house. My mom would kill me if I went to a dinner party and dragged the host through shit over not having the right dipping sauce.\n\nThis thread is nuts.", "Yea. This seems odd to me, like redditors take their condiments very seriously. I was always taught to be a thankful guest, especially when it comes to food. Try things, say thanks. Often bring a passing dish to add. I just couldn't imagine criticizing someone after inviting me over and feeding me.", "Same here, I'm appaled by the comments. Is the food people eat that boring that they need ranch on everything?", "Dude it\u2019s like 15$ for a handful of sauces lmao \n\nAnd you\u2019re insane if you think they go bad, most of them can last MONTHS or damn near forever", "For the guests' sake l, this is probably the best solution to things. OP YTA", "Swear to god,  my mother travels the world with a salt shaker in her purse just in case\u2026", "I mean, I have. But I have sodium issues, so I need low sodium ketchup and hate French's style mustard. I don't think my sister should have to buy special condiments for just me, so I show up with my own and everyone else uses hers.", "Haha I was thinking that. At the very least she shouldve perhaps had a group chat, but definitely said something like 'hey guys bit of a funny one, I'm still building everything up since moving in and don't really have many sauces gathered. Feel free to bring your favourite condiments, here's the menu to help you decide/discuss together...'\n\nBut she gets angry and defensive that they ask for sauce. maybe OP shouldn't host again. YTA, and welcome to adulting.", "I\u2019ve been to things like that at my complex, and since I live in the building I bring down condiments to share, but, yeah, it\u2019s a bit weird not to offer standard condiments.", "Sounds like something Ron Swanson would do/has done \ud83d\ude02", ">But then when somebody asks for some ketchup \n\n...or here is a packet I stole from Wendy's.", "As someone from a country that does not have creamer or half n half, can you explain to me what half n half is.\n\nWhat is it half of, and what is the other half", "Exactly. I absolutely loathe coffee with a passion, but if I am hosting, I will prepare coffee for my guests, or I warn them ahead of time, so they can bring their own.", "Exactly. I always keep cans of coke in the house. No one in my house drinks it... but my father in law does.  So I always have it on hand.\n\nAnd everytime I host a big meal, I always get plain half&half. My husband and I both like flavored creamers, but we know other people don't. It's just part of being a good host.", "A handmade sauce that said guest didn't like.", "Mother just trying to do her child right and they in here trying to be a martyr. I swear to creator they think they're the first ones not the last ones", "Yeah, I buy Diet Coke for friends that like it before they come over. I never drink soda and they know that. But I still buy it. Just like they get me coffee when I come visit.", "I have stale soda I can trade for them!", "I used to feel that way about NA beer until I discovered Athletic Brewing this dry January. They actually got the taste right", "Thr sour cream is really what sent me over the edge. They provided chives, bacon, and butter but NOT sour cream? It seems so arbitrary at that point. \n\nLike yes, this is OP preference but they've got to be able to see from that alone that they're being obtuse about this. What you do for yourself is one thing, but you've got to at least recognize this is a you thing and others might want differently.", "I said reasonable. If people normally add a certain condiment, have it available. If I barbecue chicken, I sauce it. But some people like extra sauce or to add hot sauce. Fine, it's available. The feeling I get from OP is she determined how things are to be served and thinks other things are 'messy'. She didn't offer sour cream for potatoes, as she thought bacon, chives and butter is sufficient. It isn't like people requested truffles or some out of the ordinary addition.", "What world am I even living in that a guest demanding tartar sauce makes the host an asshole. For chrissake. Whatever happened to being a thoughtful guest?", "Seasoned for you.", "Not really, it\u2019s a different kind of seasoning but it\u2019s still seasoning", "Well thankfully she does add seasoning, just not any liquid type condiments.", "As per the post, OP has mayo for sandwiches. Ketchup can be bought in really small quantities or at any fast food restaurant or food court.\n\nAll the ingredients can be bought in small quantities.  That's why I only listed those 2, simple and quick to make.", ">How is asking for a common condiment rude?\n\nI agree with you in principle. There is room for a civil discussion about what \"common\" includes. We for example don't keep ranch dressing. Yes, I know odd for Americans. I generally make salad dressing in-house. If I'm making wedge salads, I'd make ranch dressing, just like I make Caesar dressing for that. I'd probably make some ranch dressing as a choice of dips for crudite. If a guest wanted ranch dressing for potatoes I'd just go make it (takes ten minutes for the milk to ferment). I'd roll my eyes in the privacy of the kitchen, but I'd make it.", "I was always told that you shouldn't ask for things that the host has not put out, because they might not have it and that could be embarrassing. Especially, these days with the price of food. It would be a bit different with close family, though.", "right!  and all the condiments are so out of place (well, except maybe the sour cream).   Those are not condiments that belong on grilled food.", "Optimistic of you believe there's going to be a 'next time'", "I don\u2019t think necessarily YTA, but being frugal and only catering to your own tastes are traits of a bad host. It was a nice gesture, but if you\u2019re gonna be that anal about what you do and don\u2019t buy for a get together, don\u2019t host shit anymore", "I bought my husband a keychain sriracha as a gag gift a few years ago. He refills it every week lol.", "Have no fear, condiment man (or woman) is here", "Ok that sounds amazing. Any chance of you sharing the recipe?\n\nAlso going with gentle YTA for OP. Hosting is a learning experience, but you need to be open to feedback. I took my bf's cousins camping and brought all the food. Turns out one of the cousins likes ketchup on their scrambled eggs. To me that's a huge UGHH but it's not my breakfast. We ended up borrowing some ketchup from some other people we knew who were camping and I added a bottle of ketchup to my camping condiment collection.", "It's half whole milk and half cream usually.", "Half and half is a mixture of equal parts whole milk and cream.", "Creamer is typically 18% butterfat, full fat is 30+%, half and half is typically 10% butterfat.", "1/2 milk 1/2 cream", "Half and half is cream and milk.  So not as thick and heavy as whipping cream but more dense than milk.", "Yup! One of the first things I got the first time I was having guests over was the Starbucks Via coffee packets, because they are apparently good for instant coffee (according to my mom who loves coffee). I hate coffee, so I'm not going to get a coffee maker just so guests can have coffee, but having good instant coffee is a good compromise.", "Potatoes with no other fixings? I hope there was at least butter", "Exactly! \n\nWait, I notice you\u2019re the only comment and I have only one downvote\u2026did you think I disagreed with you? Either neither, OP defs needs to apologize to mom for\u2026being a mom and continuing to teach gentle lessons where needed.", "I actually think diet soda is unhealthy, but I buy it for my guests.", "right? i can't even begin to imagine the last time i drank soda. like it seriously has to have been sometime in the freaking 90s, maybe even the 80s FFS. i just don't like it and never really have. even as a kid i only wanted iced tea or lemonade.\n\nthat being said if i was having people over for a cookout i'd stock up on all kinds of different colas because i know normal fucking people like that crap. this isn't difficult.", "shan\u2019t. what if my mother stops by.", "So OP was supposed to provide every imaginable topping and condiment? Don't hosts usually cook and serve food they like? It's a dinner at her house, not an unlimited buffet bar. When someone invites you to their house and serves you food, you accept that you are not in a restaurant and do not get to choose everything.", "Ok but baked potato bar sounds like a really good idea for a family gathering. I think might steal that for a football party this fall.", "I wasn't raised in the south, but that's where my family is from (Mississippi), so that whole southern hospitality thing was absolutely drilled into my head. Right down to the \"always have a cake and coffee\" ready for visitors. Buy a wide selection of drinks, so you're certain to have something your guests will like, make sure they can all take home a plate, all that jazz. So what's hard for me to imagine is not taking guest's preferences into consideration when hosting. I mean, yeah, hosting is a lot of work, don't get me wrong. And I totally understand not wanting to put in the work. But providing condiments when you've already cleaned the house and cooked the food...wowzers", "I thnik she edited this in, but she did have butter and cooked with seasonings.

Part of being a good host is thinking of your guests & not just yourself.", "I get not liking waste, but getting the smallest possible container of something IS wasteful.\n\nIndividually wrapped ketchup packets may not cost you anything, but they generate a lot more trash than a bottle. And you will almost always be paying more per ounce (or whatever measurement you prefer) if you buy the teeny tiny bottle instead of a slightly larger size.\n\nAlso, a tip for when you\u2019re hosting: if you put out a condiment that doesn\u2019t get used up and that you don\u2019t personally want to consume, send it home with someone who seemed to enjoy it. If you phrase it as \u201cplease take this thing as a favor because it cannot stay in my house,\u201d people will absolutely take you up on that.", "I don't like ketchup or vinegar, but I always have a bottle of each for guests who come over. I wouldn't hesitate to buy a friend a drink for \u00a33 so spending \u00a33 on a bottle of ketchup for many people to use is a trivial matter even if the last third of the bottle ends up in the bin.
