When I cook I use very small amounts and generally don't buy something until I need it for a recipe. If I can get away with nabbing extra packets at restaurants I prefer doing that. The only condiment I ever really have on hand besides salt and pepper is mayo since I use it for sandwiches and mixing some different salads.\n\nThat is pretty much what led to my issue. I'm finally renting a house all on my own. I was excited that I could have my family and a couple of friends over all at the same time without having roommates to worry about so invited everyone over for dinner. I grilled up some chicken and fish, did some shrimp, veggies, and some baked potatoes. Once we started eating they were asking for things like tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, hot sauce, sour cream, ranch- just all these things that they should know I don't readily keep on hand. I told them I had made a dipping sauce for the shrimp so they could just use that for anything else because it's pretty good. My brother said he had tried it but didn't like it and things like cocktail sauce and tartar sauce are pretty basic staples to have around if you eat any kind of seafood and I told him he should've brought some instead of expecting me to waste money on something that'll just sit in my fridge.\n\nLast night our mother called me and told me I need to think about my guests if I'm going to invite people over. I told her I had already cooked for everyone, and expecting anything more was a bit much. The gist of the rest of our conversation was her basically telling me a good host that invites people over picks up drinks or a couple of condiments that they know their guests like or are likely to use. And that if it was a cost or waste issue, I should\u2019ve asked them to bring some when I invited them.\n\nI said I just won't host anything else at my house and hung up. But now I've had time to think about it and it wouldn't have been a lot cost wise but I still don't think I have any obligation to provide that kind of stuff for people that I've already gone out of my way to cook for. AITA here Reddit?\n\nEdit: Seasonings that you cook with and condiments you add to food are NOT the same thing. All the food was seasoned with things like lemon juice, garlic salt, dill, Creole seasonings, things like that. I made a Cajun buttermilk dipping sauce for the fish and shrimp, and there were things they could've put on their baked potatoes (butter, chives chopped bacon) just not any sour cream or ranch.", "created_utc": 1688401679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pnqif/aita_for_not_providing_condiments_for_my_guests/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if you really can't or don't want to buy those, you can simply make it a BYOB/bring your preferred dressings thing.

If you didn't stock *everything* people might want then that is fine, but to grill chicken and shrimp and not have pretty standard condiments like hot sauce, bbq sauce, etc is not being very hospitable.

Horseradish sour cream is also a common thing to pair with steak, and sour cream can be substituted for milk in mashed potatoes or used as a baked potato topping. Tartar sauce is an easy combo of mayo, relish, and a squeeze of lemon, another easy selection of condiments that people may ask for for the food you provided.

When I cook I use very small amounts and generally don't buy something until I need it for a recipe. If I can get away with nabbing extra packets at restaurants I prefer doing that. The only condiment I ever really have on hand besides salt and pepper is mayo since I use it for sandwiches and mixing some different salads.\r  \n\r  \nThat is pretty much what led to my issue. I'm finally renting a house all on my own. I was excited that I could have my family and a couple of friends over all at the same time without having roommates to worry about so invited everyone over for dinner. I grilled up some chicken and fish, did some shrimp, veggies, and some baked potatoes. Once we started eating they were asking for things like tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, hot sauce, sour cream, ranch- just all these things that they should know I don't readily keep on hand. I told them I had made a dipping sauce for the shrimp so they could just use that for anything else because it's pretty good. My brother said he had tried it but didn't like it and things like cocktail sauce and tartar sauce are pretty basic staples to have around if you eat any kind of seafood and I told him he should've brought some instead of expecting me to waste money on something that'll just sit in my fridge.\r  \n\r  \nLast night our mother called me and told me I need to think about my guests if I'm going to invite people over. I told her I had already cooked for everyone, and expecting anything more was a bit much. The gist of the rest of our conversation was her basically telling me a good host that invites people over picks up drinks or a couple of condiments that they know their guests like or are likely to use. And that if it was a cost or waste issue, I should\u2019ve asked them to bring some when I invited them.\r  \n\r  \nI said I just won't host anything else at my house and hung up. But now I've had time to think about it and it wouldn't have been a lot cost wise but I still don't think I have any obligation to provide that kind of stuff for people that I've already gone out of my way to cook for.
