When I cook I use very small amounts and generally don't buy something until I need it for a recipe. If I can get away with nabbing extra packets at restaurants I prefer doing that. The only condiment I ever really have on hand besides salt and pepper is mayo since I use it for sandwiches and mixing some different salads.\n\nThat is pretty much what led to my issue. I'm finally renting a house all on my own. I was excited that I could have my family and a couple of friends over all at the same time without having roommates to worry about so invited everyone over for dinner. I grilled up some chicken and fish, did some shrimp, veggies, and some baked potatoes. Once we started eating they were asking for things like tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, hot sauce, sour cream, ranch- just all these things that they should know I don't readily keep on hand. I told them I had made a dipping sauce for the shrimp so they could just use that for anything else because it's pretty good. My brother said he had tried it but didn't like it and things like cocktail sauce and tartar sauce are pretty basic staples to have around if you eat any kind of seafood and I told him he should've brought some instead of expecting me to waste money on something that'll just sit in my fridge.\n\nLast night our mother called me and told me I need to think about my guests if I'm going to invite people over. I told her I had already cooked for everyone, and expecting anything more was a bit much. The gist of the rest of our conversation was her basically telling me a good host that invites people over picks up drinks or a couple of condiments that they know their guests like or are likely to use. And that if it was a cost or waste issue, I should\u2019ve asked them to bring some when I invited them.\n\nI said I just won't host anything else at my house and hung up. But now I've had time to think about it and it wouldn't have been a lot cost wise but I still don't think I have any obligation to provide that kind of stuff for people that I've already gone out of my way to cook for. AITA here Reddit?\n\nEdit: Seasonings that you cook with and condiments you add to food are NOT the same thing. All the food was seasoned with things like lemon juice, garlic salt, dill, Creole seasonings, things like that. I made a Cajun buttermilk dipping sauce for the fish and shrimp, and there were things they could've put on their baked potatoes (butter, chives chopped bacon) just not any sour cream or ranch.", "created_utc": 1688401679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pnqif/aita_for_not_providing_condiments_for_my_guests/", "score": 1841, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if you really can't or don't want to buy those, you can simply make it a BYOB/bring your preferred dressings thing.

If you didn't stock *everything* people might want then that is fine, but to grill chicken and shrimp and not have pretty standard condiments like hot sauce, bbq sauce, etc is not being very hospitable.

When I cook I use very small amounts and generally don't buy something until I need it for a recipe. If I can get away with nabbing extra packets at restaurants I prefer doing that. The only condiment I ever really have on hand besides salt and pepper is mayo since I use it for sandwiches and mixing some different salads.\r  \n\r  \nThat is pretty much what led to my issue. I'm finally renting a house all on my own. I was excited that I could have my family and a couple of friends over all at the same time without having roommates to worry about so invited everyone over for dinner. I grilled up some chicken and fish, did some shrimp, veggies, and some baked potatoes. Once we started eating they were asking for things like tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, hot sauce, sour cream, ranch- just all these things that they should know I don't readily keep on hand. I told them I had made a dipping sauce for the shrimp so they could just use that for anything else because it's pretty good. My brother said he had tried it but didn't like it and things like cocktail sauce and tartar sauce are pretty basic staples to have around if you eat any kind of seafood and I told him he should've brought some instead of expecting me to waste money on something that'll just sit in my fridge.\r  \n\r  \nLast night our mother called me and told me I need to think about my guests if I'm going to invite people over. I told her I had already cooked for everyone, and expecting anything more was a bit much. The gist of the rest of our conversation was her basically telling me a good host that invites people over picks up drinks or a couple of condiments that they know their guests like or are likely to use. And that if it was a cost or waste issue, I should\u2019ve asked them to bring some when I invited them.\r  \n\r  \nI said I just won't host anything else at my house and hung up. But now I've had time to think about it and it wouldn't have been a lot cost wise but I still don't think I have any obligation to provide that kind of stuff for people that I've already gone out of my way to cook for.

That being said, you don't have to be a restaurant, but when you're hosting, just buy the smallest bottles of off brand condiments (from the dollar store) and then throw them away after. No big deal. Or even send them home with people, if you don't want to be wasteful.", "Lol but op doesn't have the mayo or ketchup.", "Agreed! NTA OP!", "Omg the only sane person here. Maybe in the states it's different but we serve potato's different ways (roast, chips, baked) when we have bbq's and people don't have to have sour cream, bacon chives etc. The comments seem really weird.

She didn't offer sour cream for potatoes, as she thought bacon, chives and butter is sufficient.

For example, If you're a Vegetarian .. but invite over a bunch of friends that aren't .. and then only provide Vegetarian foods, you're self absorbed and just need to remain a guest and not a Host. Nobody cares that YOU don't eat sauces on your food. lol", "YTA. I'm not big on most condiments myself, but when I invite people over for dinner or for a cookout, I always make sure that I have at least basic condiments such as ketchup, mustard, relish and things I know that certain people like. Those things can be kept in the refrigerator until your next cookout or bring it with you when you go to your mom's house for a cookout. It doesn't really cost that much and just because you don't like something doesn't mean others don't either.", "Soft YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s good to consider your guests when you meal plan. Hosting is centered around making everyone feel comfortable and welcome in your home, which generally means going a tad out of your way and picking up some extra stuff. When my family comes over for meals I make sure I have coffee creamer even if I don\u2019t use it, dairy even if I\u2019m allergic (to a reasonable/sage extent) and wine even if I don\u2019t drink it. If I have overnight guests, I stock up on travel shampoos in case they forgot, extra toothbrushes, etc. \n\nCondiments are more of a given than alcohol, etc. so it is reasonable to provide popular ones. That being said those sound like kind of obscure condiments to have on hand IMHO. That seems more surprising than say, hamburgers without ketchup. I don\u2019t know anyone who just *has* tartar sauce with fish if the fish is seasoned to be good without it, and I have NEVER just had cocktail sauce on hand (not common at ALL where I am from) but sour cream with a potato is a bit more reasonable. \n\n\nAt the same time, a guest (even a guest that is your mom) calling to lecture you about your hosting skills is\u2026. Different.", "YTA.  I loathe tea and coffee.  But I still have a basic coffee maker, a tin of coffee and a selection of teas in my panty.  Because in society most people expect a tea or coffee when visiting or after a meal.  It's part of being a host.  \n\nMost condiments keep for quite a long time anyway, so investing in some small size bottles which you keep for visitors is just standard.", "Yeah YTA.

You can serve 5 star food but if it\u2019s dry people won\u2019t enjoy it", "YTA for your attitude.\n\nHosting is about your guests, not you.  A good host tries to anticipate the needs and wants of their guests for their enjoyment and provide for them within reason.  You may not like those things, but presumably you've dined in restaurants and have a general idea of what many people generally like with certain kinds of foods and you should know the people you like/love enough to invite over to your house to have at least an inkling of what their preferences are.  In this instance, I'd give a pass on the ranch and hot sauce, but sour cream for a potato is as basic as it gets and tartar sauce and cocktail sauce are very common for fish and shrimp.  And it sounds like your guests were very gracious and accepting in the moment of your lack of condiments.\n\nIn early December, I host an open house chili bar so friends and extended family can get together and not have to do the mad dash of trying to visit everyone on the actual holidays.  I'm lactose intolerant, but sure as hell buy cheese and sour cream for my guests because those are things that are reasonably expected and enjoyed by people when eating chili.  I'm also throwing a large party later this summer at a very nice restaurant.  I have two family members attending who are very picky eaters.  Do I really want sliders and chicken wings served with my charcuterie board filled with pate and brie en croute with macerated berries?  No, I do not, but I am having them because the comfort of my guests is important to me.", "YTA ~~NTA~~\n\nChicken and fish don't get condiments typically, unless you from fried the fish then definitely tartar sauce is the norm.  Hot sauce I can see as a request for anything but that's an acceptable condiment not to have as it isn't a common standard for the food you made.\n\nIf you had done burgers or hotdogs and didn't have ketchup or mustard I'd definitely say YTA, but not here.  Turn it around, this wouldn't be a request unless you did a bad job preparing the food.  You'll either shame them out get feedback on how to improve your cooking!

It's understandable to forget a few things that you don't normally have, but there should at least be some effort.\n\nDepends a bit on a relationship, but I also think it's ok to ask someone to bring a condiment if they typically have a large bottle and a small amount will be used.
