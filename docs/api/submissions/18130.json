After that I was like \u201ccan\u2019t you just dress normal for once in your life? Is it that much of a stretch to ask you to dress nice?\u201d \n\nShe lost her shit over this and, went on to say that she was wearing what she wanted and I couldn\u2019t control what she wore and that was the end of it. I then was like don\u2019t even bother coming then. She ended up storming off and hasn\u2019t talked to me since. I feel bad she got upset but it\u2019s my sweet 16 I\u2019ll never have another one.
