After that I was like \u201ccan\u2019t you just dress normal for once in your life? Is it that much of a stretch to ask you to dress nice?\u201d \n\nShe lost her shit over this and, went on to say that she was wearing what she wanted and I couldn\u2019t control what she wore and that was the end of it. I then was like don\u2019t even bother coming then. She ended up storming off and hasn\u2019t talked to me since. I feel bad she got upset but it\u2019s my sweet 16 I\u2019ll never have another one.

It\u2019s amazing how they\u2019re just normal humans who do normal human things just with their own style.", "YTA\n\nListen, if the theme is \"me at the beach with beautiful beach people\" then only ask people who already dress like that.\n\nFor your goth friend, goth *is* her normal. Black and chains *is* normal. That was the asshole moment in this situation.\n\nIf you want to keep that friendship, you need to either A) apologize for the normal comment and your behavior and ask if she wants to come in goth beachwear, or B) apologize for the normal comment and your behavior and let her know that you only want the photographs to have people with a matching aesthetic to yours.\n\nShe may not want to be your friend anymore after this. And that's fine. That's her decision she's making in order to protect herself and that's good. \n\nBut you need to know:\n\nYou. Aren't. Normal.\n\nYou *have* your own normal.\n\nBut I assure you, no one is *normal.*\n\nNormal looks different for everyone.\n\nGo watch It's A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood and pay attention. You will absolutely learn something if you honestly listen and pay attention.", "YTA. This person is not your friend, because you do not treat friends like this. Hope your perfect party was worth it.", "yea i feel like your an asshole for asking a friend to change to appease your party aesthetic, if she\u2019s really your friend you shouldn\u2019t care and should be happy she\u2019s their regardless\u2026.", "YTA. never in my entire 23 years of life have i attended a themed party and seen *everyone* dressing in the theme. it just doesn\u2019t happen and you need to set your expectations accordingly. people just won\u2019t dress in a theme that makes them genuinely uncomfortable to dress in and it\u2019s unfair for you to expect them too just because you would. you set the theme for *you* to dress in & decorate the party in. those who like the theme will dress in it and those who don\u2019t\u2026 won\u2019t. i wanna chalk it up to your age but damn, even i wasn\u2019t that shallow at 16 that i\u2019d rather my \u2018friend\u2019 not be at my party just because they probably literally *don\u2019t own anything that would fit the theme*. \n\nalso - your priorities should be on having fun with your friends not the pictures. the pictures are a bonus not the main event", "YTA kinda \nI mean if you wanted people dressed a center way at your sweet 16 I guess that\u2019s fair Idk if I was in this situation I would have just let her wear what she wants  it\u2019s just nice seeing everyone as there true self she\u2019s not a prop for your photo", "YTA.  You should go apologize and make sure she's comfortable with going to your party.  If you feel bad you're going to have that on your shoulders for awhile if she doesn't go.  I don't understand why goth can't be at the beach, it could be combined perhaps.", "YTA. There's thousands of ways you could have dealt with it and you went with the worst one. Your friend (really think she's now your ex-friend) has an aesthetic that represents her and is part of her and you think it's not \"normal\" enough for you. You do know there are beach emo/gothic clothes, right? For the love of God, call her and apologise profusely. If she does accept your apology (you should pray she will) you can ask her to go with you to look for accessories or outfits or something together. You two can find something that you both like. AND PAY FOR IT YOURSELF.", "YTA. People are not set decorations in your life. Your pretty pretty princess party pictures are not more important than other people's feelings. You just threw away a person over clothing. You told her she wasn't normal. That's not a good look.  How good of a friend were you to her?", "YTA\n\nSo, if she found a goth bathing suit with skulls and chains and a large black sunhat, she would be in theme but still weird and not allowed? You can't claim to be friends with someone and then be ashamed of how they live", "YTA. You\u2019re a shit friend who cares more about optics than people.", "What in the actual fuck is wrong with you people calling her the AH?\n\nOP, NTA\n\nMy daughter is a cis girl, but has tons of friends that are AFAB or AMAB and have different identities and styles, some very extreme- think binders, all black, or on the opposite very frilly and girly. However in her friend group there have been many themed bday parties (80s, Stranger Things, my little pony, Great Gatsby, 2000s etc) in the past couple years as they all grow up (they\u2019re all 15/16 now) and EVERYONE has changed for the theme and gotten into the spirit of the party because they care for the person, so even if it\u2019s opposite of their normal style they\u2019ve all obliged and even had fun with it ( for example a girl dressed up as James Spader the douchey guy from pretty in pink for the 80s party)anyhow, you\u2019re not the AH, a dress code is a dress code and people who don\u2019t have the mental capacity to be creative with their look for one evening are people you should reconsider having in your life\n\nOne thing I will say is your comment about dressing \u201cnormal\u201d was a bit of an AH move. If you read this, OP I would like you to take a quote to heart from the perfection that is Morticia Addams\u2026.\u201dNormal is an illusion. What is normal to the spider is catastrophic for the fly\u201d", "Bucking the trend and saying ESH on this one. OP, you suck for your use of the word \u201cnormal\u201d like that. It\u2019s fine having a dress code and expecting guests to follow it. But referring to it as \u201cdressing normal\u201d was too much. \n\nI\u2019m also saying the friend sucks though. Not for her response to the \u201cnormal\u201d comment though. That was justified. She sucks for arguing with a host about the dress code of a themed party. It\u2019d have been one thing for her to ask \u201cwould such-and-such be okay to wear?\u201d but it\u2019s another thing entirely to make a fuss and insist on going while not adhering to the dress code. That\u2019s when the friend should have just bowed out and refused to go if her attire was that important to her.", "YTA. Asking her to dress to the theme was fine, until you went to \u201dnormal\u201d.. That made you the AH.", "YTA -  when you need a  friend for the things that truly matter in life  I PROMISE you what they are wearing will not matter. You must not like her very much. If thats the case then you accomplished getting rid of her.", "N T A for wanting your guests to follow a code and suggesting that whoever doesn't follow it mustn't come to the party. But asking someone to be normal for one day is demeaning and made you cross the like into YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. This could have been a cool chance to look up \u201cgoth beach wear\u201d and see if she wanted to show skin and be dark, or cover her self head to toe in black - they have athletic wear and \u201crash guards\u201d y\u2019all could have gotten in cool colored and patterns. If she showed up in a black maxi beach cover up and a mortician Adam\u2019s beach hat - that would have Been awesome! \n\nThis could have been a cool way to explore her style in fun ways and you blew it. Apologize and offer to buy her a kick ass beach cover up in her choice of style", "YTA - she could still be emo and in your beach theme. But you wanted her to not be emo at all (you said no big eyeliner etc in a comment).

I like when they have those little black parasols.", "I think OP was trying to say a beach theme, as in swimsuit and such could be black/goth/emo\u2026or maybe I read it wrong?", "The type of party is irrelevant.

Silly old goth me..  here I thought being 40 years old is being a grown up..\n\nIt's have nothing about growing up to do?! \n\n  Yes, there are occasions where you would have to adjust.  But, surprise!   A lot of people with alternative styles know how to keep their style but toned down, or make a twist of it to make it suitable for the situation. \nThat includes; work space dress codes,  weddings, special celebrations, etc, even THEMED party's.
