You have a freaking medical condition! You're not choosing to be \"boring\", and the only reason he even had to bring this up in the first place was to insult and berate you.", "NTA. I love music. I have a piano in my living room and I play it all the time. I have plenty of friends who don\u2019t care about music at all and would rather sit in silence than have music going in the background. You know what I don\u2019t do? The shit your BIL is doing. I can almost guarantee you he got so upset because you\u2019re right on the mark about him treating his students the same way.", "He shouldn't be teaching if he responds to disabilities like that. He at least deserved to have that pointed out to him so he can have a good think about how he's treating you. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You have asked him repeatedly to change his behaviour towards you and he hasn't. That you used the nuclear option isn't relevant.", "NTA, and honestly I *am* concerned about how he treats his students!", "NTA.  He needs to understand that your condition isn't something you can just adapt to like he's suggesting.  Does he think someone who's blind can just overcome it by trying hard enough to see?  You only went as far as you did because previous, presumably more polite attempts at getting him to back off clearly didn't work.", "NTA - you had asked him politely many times. He didn't stop so of course you escalated. What did he expect?", "NTA, he's speaking about a disability he clearly knows nothing about. He has not bothered to do any research about it, clearly. He's attempting to push his own points of view and agenda onto you. You have legitimate concerns about what would happen if he gets a student into his class with the same disability. If he truly doesn't feel he's doing anything wrong, then he shouldn't have a problem with his colleagues knowing what he's doing to you.", "NTA. I enjoy music, you not enjoying music does not cut into my enjoyment. Unless you\u2019re leaving something big out like you spend every get together talking about how boring you find music and how your other interests are better, I don\u2019t get why your BIL would care. I have literally no idea what music my brother in law likes, it matters not at all in my life.", "NTA and most definitely tell your friend about his social incompetence.", "NTA  Sometimes you have to bring out the big guns.  When I married, I did not choose to change my name.  One man in my office insisted on calling me Mrs husbandsname.  I corrected him repeatedly.  On my first anniversary, I dragged him into our supervisor's office, reviewed the situation, told them that if it ever happened again I would file formal sexual harassment charges against them both, and walked out.  I have no idea what they said to each other, but it never happened again.  You just brought out the big guns.  Good for you.", "YTA. You escalated some (admittedly annoying & strange) banter into a threat. It was an out-of-proportion response, even if you were bothered.", "NTA \n\nHe has no right to harass you about something that\u2019s a medical condition for you. He was completely in the wrong to keep pressing the subject after you repeatedly asked him to stop. You weren\u2019t out of line for what you said. \n\nIf the idea of his colleagues finding out about his behavior upsets him so much then he should take that as a wake up call that his behavior is inappropriate. His boss should probably know he\u2019s capable of treating people with disabilities like that when he\u2019s working with students, anyways.", "ESH. Sounds like this guy is a jerk who can't just accept the situation as it is. Years of that must have been frustrating and it's no surprise that you lost your temper. I do think you were in the right for pulling him up on it after him refusing to let it go. Threatening his job at a family event was probably a step too far. As satisfying as I'm sure it was, I'm sure there was a way to say it without causing drama. Two wrongs don't make a right.", "NTA.

However, you can draw a boundary \"I won't let you continue speaking to me that way. If you continue, I will leave the conversation/situation\" without going for the \"I'm going to tattle at your job.\" I mean his mom was right there; why not tattle to her?", "NTA, it's not like you bash other people for liking music, you just have no way personally of enjoying music yourself. He was being T A. He needs to let it go already, and I say this as someone who LOVES music and singing.", "NTA; that's very whack of him to bring it up continuously.", "You didn't threaten his job.  You put his behavior in context to make him realize that what he was doing was not OK.  This is similar, basically, to 'would you say that to your daughter or mother?' to someone who is being sexist.

You aren't a child, so what do you expect your friend would actually do? Do you think your friend will say \"hello Principal, X is mean to his sister in law about being tone deaf. She is concerned about how he treats his students because he always argues with her about it.\" Do you hear how ridiculous that is? \n\nStop causing issues in the family over a stupid reason. Just ignore him or change the subject. You don't have to be as ignorant as him. If you refuse to engage or take the bait, an argument cannot exist.", "NTA. He was bullying you because of your disability, despite your repeated requests to stop. It is perfectly appropriate to indicate a concern that he would bully other people for their disability in his professional context. It's not like you reached out to the school, you just warned him. You didn't do anything wrong. Plus, seems like it worked.", "NTA.  Time to stop being around him.", "NTA, also I am fascinated by how your music teacher helped you enjoy the subject with your disability?", "NTA \n\nIt appears that your BIL is pretty tone deaf when it comes to respectful ways of communication, disabilities, diversity, inclusion and the varied ways other people around him live. \n\nHe continued to treat you this way over a prolonged period of time.  You've addressed and you finally had enough. Wouldn't say your approach was optimal but certainly got the point across. Pretty sad it took going that far for him to actually hear you. \n\nEveryone should really focus on his REPEATED behaviour that caused/resulted in your reactive response and not your reactive response.", "ESH.\n\nHim for basically bullying you; and you for threatening him.", "YTA you threatened your brother-in-laws career in retaliation for his interpersonal relationship with you. That's personal and between the two of you. His disdain for you does not rise to the level of discrimination. It appears that you would like to weaponize what you characterize as a disability and play the Victim. Shame on you.", "NTA and you raised a valid point, if he is that incapable of handling your disability, articulated by a grown adult able to fend for herself,  then how is he to students who might be overawed or actually damaged by his behavior?", "NTA and he had very little reason to take your \"threat\" seriously, we all say rash things in the heat of the moment.", "NTA\n\nWould he tell a wheelchair bound person that he can\u2019t believe they don\u2019t love running and they should stop being so boring and \u201ctry to adapt.\u201d\n\nYou have a disability.

He's treating you like it's your fault that you have a medical condition. If he can treat someone within the family like this, I'm very concerned about how he treats students with any kind of condition, music related or not. Plus, people like that won't stop unless you hit them where it hurts. He's obviously passionate about his job, so threatening that it was.

He'd pester the child and probably bully the kid for being \"boring\" and would be condescending towards the child.\n\nThat kind of adult should not be a teacher.

And if he cannot understand a perspective outside of his own, he may need more experience before he\u2019s ready to lead his own class.\n\nHello\u2026 I was a total band nerd, TWO of my siblings are music teachers and band/choir directors\u2026 AND my brother and I both have ND kids and guess what subject \u201cspoke\u201d to them when they were struggling to grasp other things?!?! MUSIC! No educator should be close-minded about people who process or experience anything differently\u2026 but especially not the arts.\n\nMy siblings each had students with this disorder (only reason I\u2019d heard of it) and being at small Private Schools at the time, music was required as they didn\u2019t have other art/elective options until Jr High. So they asked their students if they were interested in percussive instruments and one played drums and stuck with it - despite struggling with timing (in one student\u2019s case) because the timing and beats are also math (in which he excelled!) he tuned out the music since he could watch my sister directing for queues and focus on the beat counts. It was really neat!\n\nThe other student enjoyed playing hand percussion on some pieces and got really involved in set design and technical support.", "But she didn\u2019t tell someone at his school.
