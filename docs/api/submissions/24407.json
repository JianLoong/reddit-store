BEFORE YOU COMMENT READ THE BOTTOM\n\nI've (25M) known my friend Jerome (26M (not his name)) since middle school. He's one of my best friends, and the first Thursday of every month, our friend group has a get together at his house.\n\nHis wife Jasmine (30F, also not her name) is a very sweet lady, and their kids (both 4) are both very funny and polite, if not a little energetic. And they love the Thursday night get together cause about 10 people are over and they get too stay up late and run around while we hang out.\n\nSo it was finally time for the kids to go too bed, but one of them wanted too stay up and happened too be by me. He tried his best too get me to play cool uncle, but it was 9 o'clock and Jerome looked tired so I figured it was time for bed. He threw a tantrum and whined at me so Jerome scooped him up and took him to bed.\n\nAfter he went down, Jerome came back to apologize for his son's behavior towards me. I said there was no need, I know it was late and his kid was tired. He's a good kid. Jerome thanked me for backing him up, cause I take the kid's side alot as a joke. This is where I fucked up.\n\nSo I said \"Not my circus, not my monkeys.\" Which is a turn of phrase, nothing to do with race, and Jerome knew, but Jasmine did not apparently and she was standing nearby when she heard me say it.\n\nShe gave me an odd look and walked away, I didn't think anything at the time but another friend approached me a little later and asked me what I said to get Jasmine so riled up cause she was going around telling everyone I called her kids monkeys.\n\nI was fairly offended. I attended their wedding, I've known these kids since birth, I buy them birthday and Christmas presents, they call me uncle, I'm at this house once a month, I love this family, what the fuck is this?\n\nSo I asked Jasmine if she would be willing to speak with me privately, not wanting to cause a scene and she said no. So I asked why she was telling people I called her kids monkeys in a derrogatory way, when the phrase I used doesn't have anything to do with that. She tells me she's never heard that phrase, and it's likely an old southern racist idiom. \n\nI must admit, I was pretty pissed at this point. I am friends with her and her husband, and I don't deserve to be treated like this for something misunderstood on her end. I apologized for any offense she might have taken, but she had simply not understood what I said and applied her own context. We went back and forth until I just left. Didn't say goodbye to anyone, nothing to Jerome, but I wasn't going to be talked to like this when I did nothing wrong.\n\nIt's the day after, and I'm still annoyed but I haven't talked to anyone about last night yet. My phone blew up after I left but I'm not responding to anyone right now. Am I in the wrong here? Does Jasmine have a point? I need to know what people uninvolved think cause this is ridiculous to me.\n\nI didn't feel the need to state this earlier but I am white. Jerome, Jasmine and their kids are not.\n\nUPDATE UPDATE! READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE!: So I just got off the phone with Jerome and I fucked up. So she was drunk as a skunk last night. We all tend to drink lightly at their house cause we all have to drive in the dark and the steetlights are fucky in that neighborhood. But she and Jerome don't have to drive cause it's their house. Anyway, I had no idea she was slammed last night and she's super hung over and embarassed right now. I regret posting this but I can't delete it. 100% on me. I feel like an idiot. We talked on the phone for like 40 minutes, we're all ok now.

And it was immature of her to talk to other people about it instead of confronting you directly.", "NTA.

It is not calling anyone a monkey, it's a polish proverb stating you don't want to be involved in something they have no control over.\n\nMy guess is Jasmine gets pissed when Spanish people use the word for the color black.", "I dont think the answer to racism is scrubbing the word monkey from the lexicon, though. That feels like an unreasonable stance", "The phrase is about managing monkeys in a circus.  What's next, other families getting upset for equating their household to a circus?\n\nWith that said, I would be for depreciating the phrase if it upsets someone.  Still, NTA.", "It\u2019s the fact she didn\u2019t let him explain", "I know that but if the first thing goes to \u201cOMG UR A RACIST\u201d when someone says that generic saying you got issues you need to deal with", "> but saying \"how dare you call me a racist\" when you accidentally make a racist remark\n\nDifferent strokes I guess. I don't get either of these from the OP's post.\n\nAFAICT The OP's incredulousness stems from the lack of charity being afforded to him - especially when he's been a supportive friend of the family for years - over a simple misunderstanding. I didn't interpret it as \"how dare you call me racist?\" and more of a \"Why are you disparaging me to our friends behind my back?\"\n\nI also disagree that it was \"accidentally racist\", just an extremely surface level misunderstanding. Might just be my perspective because I've heard the idiom referenced in this post *many* times and it has never had any sort of racial aspect. Just another way of saying \"not my problem\".", "I wouldn\u2019t want them around if that were the case but i don\u2019t make up origins of popular phases to suit my gut reactions when I haven\u2019t even heard them. Lmao", "If the person who I thought insulted me was a long term friend and they asked to speak privately to clear up the misunderstanding of course I would at least listen to them. Why should she entertain him? Because she should be a reasonable human being", "Yeah sorry dude I would 100% pull him out of there and explain what I heard and that I'd like him to leave, at which point he would correct my incorrect assumption instead of talking shit all night. Or I'd pull my husband and tell him. But your point makes no sense considering she doubled down. It's called being wrong and strong", "It is hypervigilance. That hypervigilance is understandable and not necessarily unwarranted but its not like 100% of the uses of the word monkey are gonna be racist. If it were that word, sure. Thats just vigilance. Her reaction comes from trauma or perceived threat. It is absolutely hypervigilant.\n\nShe has a long time relationship with this human and she set him on fire over her own ignorance. It's one thing to say \"hey, I googled it and i know you didnt mean anything by it, but in the future please do not refer to anything related to my kids in terms of \"monkeys\" for any reason, surely you can see how it's a loaded word\" and it's an entire other thing to immediately and permanently torch his reputation and his friendship with your husband and children because you couldn't be bothered to google an idiom or ask a follow up question.", "A few years ago, I got called out for using that expression.  So I switched it up and now say \"not my elephants.\"", "I think this makes plenty of a sense on a cultural global level, as something to be mindful of. It just seems silly on an individual level to have a friend try to turn other people against you for a clear misunderstanding. That's the part that I feel is hypervigilant.\n\nBut to each their own.", "No one said that but perhaps don't use phrase where you are comparing their situation to wrangling monkeys", "That's why I said ESH.", "Issues likee the amount of racism she's been exposed to. I say that sarcastically but she's bringing her past experiences into her thought process. I think she needs to talk to him and not jump to conclusions but I think he needs to try and understand where she's coming from. I would think his involvement in their lives should be enough for her to give him grace to listen but he seems to be completely dismissing or refusing to see where she's coming from.", ">She has a long time relationship with this human and she set him on fire over her own ignorance. It's one thing to say \"hey, I googled it and i know you didnt mean anything by it, but in the future please do not refer to anything related to my kids in terms of \"monkeys\" for any reason, surely you can see how it's a loaded word\" and it's an entire other thing to immediately and permanently torch his reputation and his friendship with your husband and children because you couldn't be bothered to google an idiom or ask a follow up question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust basically quoting this whole thing because it's perfectly put.", "How dare you call her kids fat!!!\n\n/s", "OP isn\u2019t the asshole it\u2019s not his fault she went nuclear and went around saying he\u2019s racist without confronting him/letting him explain \n\nEdit: agree to disagree"]}
