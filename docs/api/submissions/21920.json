{"id": 21920, "submission_id": "14wl5ws", "title": "AITA for telling my friends wife she\u2019s a terrible human being?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019m not in the wrong here but a few people in my life have said that I went too far with my words, so I\u2019d like an outside perspective. Fake names for everyone involved.\n\nI (29m) have a friend named Jake (28m) who recently got married to his girlfriend, Jenna (29f), about two months ago. Jenna was introduced to our friend group about three years ago and we all loved her for the longest time, she was truly a great person to be around. They were coming back from celebrating a long 4th of July vacation this passed Thursday evening and were in a car accident. This is the story that Jenna had told everyone in our friend group of what happened. They were coming back from his families cabin up north, driving south on a two lane highway, Jake was the one driving. A pickup truck, who\u2019s driver they later learned was drunk, began tailgating them at one point and Jake was going to move over to let him pass. Well the guy instead swerved to drive around him and when he was in front of them lost control of his truck causing a major accident. Jenna told us that just before they ran in to the guy, that Jake reached his right arm over to shield her, however when they hit, several things from the back of the guys truck pierced the windshield, injuring Jakes arm to the point it had to be amputated. Jake is right handed so he\u2019s now lost the ability to do multiple things.\n\nHere\u2019s the part where I may be the AH. Jenna told us she didn\u2019t think she could stay with a disabled man, and that it wasn\u2019t something she signed up for this early in life. Most of us looked at her in shock and I replied with, yes you did actually and quoted the \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d part of the wedding vows. Jenna just said that those are words that people never really mean and that I couldn\u2019t understand the pain she was dealing with right now. I got angry at that point and replied back that she had no right to talk about \u201cpain\u201d when her husband LITERALLY lost his arm saving her and that she\u2019s a terrible person for even considering leaving him. Jenna ran off crying and while most of my friend group agrees that this is a terrible side of her, I didn\u2019t help matters by yelling. Now that I\u2019ve cooled off a bit I can see where they\u2019re coming from, but AITA?\n\nEdit to add: her exact words to us were \u201cI didn\u2019t sign up to be someone\u2019s caregiver at 29.\u201d Apparently she hasn\u2019t said anything to Jake about this and none of us have either, we\u2019re giving her a week to kinda cool off and think things with a calmer head but if she doesn\u2019t change her stance, we will tell him.", "created_utc": 1689063865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wl5ws/aita_for_telling_my_friends_wife_shes_a_terrible/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. My husband has severe mental health issues and the thought of walking away from him because \u201cit\u2019s not what I signed up for\u201d has never crossed my mind! You were right in what you said to her, she is an awful human being", "NTA. If Jenna was feeling overwhelmed and saying \u2018I don\u2019t know how to do this,\u2019 you\u2019d be in the wrong for losing your temper like this. But for her to be considering leaving him - to the point where she\u2019s going around and SAYING it to his friends - definitely puts her as the A H here.", "Not to trivialise anything but he only lost an arm, and whilst that is traumatic for him an\u00b4d will require some large adjustments on his part it is not going to turn her into a \"caregiver\" except in the loosest sense, he may not be able to tie shoelaces or deal with a fitted sheet and missionary position is difficult but generally life is manageable. (source: my husband has only one arm after an accident 10 years ago)", "I'm going to reserve judgement bc while Jake survived you are all going through a sort of grieving process. If Jenna truly just dips, yes she's terrible, and no, you weren't an ass for pointing that out. BUT grief is weird, major changes are *hard* it's almost like cold feet before a wedding, it's a momentary panic attack where things get said that people don't really mean. \n\nI wasn't there, idk if she said this in a cold, resolved manner, or if she was panicking and venting to friends looking for reassurance and support. Considering she ran off crying I'm guessing it was the latter. \n\nno matter what I'm glad Jake survived and wish him an easy recovery.", "NTA - I would've been way harsh to be fully honest. You did the right thing. This is how narcissists act when they no longer find a situation beneficial to them. The sad thing is their victims don't typically find out until their greatest hour of need. Rally around your friend who lost his arm and give him all of the support he needs. Don't waste your breath on Jenna. She will be spending the next few months monkey branching to someone else. I think your friend needs to nail down his finances and find a decent divorce lawyer.", "NTA\n\nWhile I think it's ok to have these thoughts and voicing concerns, her disregard of the vow with \"word that people never really mean\" makes her a huge ahole in my opinion.\n\nIt could have easily been a talk like \"Guys, I know it's harsh but I don't know if I am actually strong enough to help Jake and be there for him\" instead of this \"Guys, my husband is defective, I think I will divorce him, lol\"", "NTA, she sounds like an entitled and selfish person. Don't get me wrong  but she is allowed to have doubts about her future. However her acting like he is lesser of a human being was \ud83d\udcaf disgusting. You were prety spot on about what you said abt her, so kudos to you for being brave enough to say what everyone was thinking\ud83d\udc4f. But honestly let her divorce your friend. He does not deserve a partner who does not care about his well-being, especially when HE LOST AN ARM PROTECTING HER. If I were her, I would treasure the person who loves me so much with all my heart. I feel sorry for your friend. He deserves better!\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, that is so awful of her !\n\nFirstly, you are right about the \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d.  \nSecondly, he \"just\" lost his arm, he will learn to do a lot of things differently and it is not like she will bit stuck changing his diapers or something like that...\n\nSaying she doesn't want to stay with a disabled man shows she only cares about look and is probably very superficial. I bet he will regret his sacrifice.", "NTA. Wow, what a situation. Jenna's reaction to Jake's disability and her comments about not signing up for this are incredibly insensitive and hurtful.", "NTA and I'm so sorry for your friend. I think his wife is a lost cause, because if she doesn't want to stay with him to help him, she will resent him even more if she does. Better to let her go and everyone else who loves Jake can support and protect him.", "NTA - There's a lot of grieving taking place at the moment. Give it some time to cool off.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t mean those vows means she shouldn\u2019t have married as she\u2019s still a child mentally. He deserves so much better as he tried saving her and she wants to leave him for the outcome of it. She doesn\u2019t deserve him", "NTA. You only said what everyone was thinking. Yes, she\u2019s dealing with trauma, but hopefully your words do make her think before she acts. I have a feeling you wouldn\u2019t be the last to tell her that.", "ESH\n\nDivorces are a thing for a reason. That said I don't agree with her reason for seeking one. \n\nBut she is allowed to. \n\n>while most of my friend group agrees that this is a terrible side of her, I didn\u2019t help matters by yelling. Now that I\u2019ve cooled off a bit I can see where they\u2019re coming from,\n\nSeems you already know this. I hope Jake does better.", "She has been through a very traumatizing event. You should be gentle with her and not suppose that because she was physically unharmed, everything's okay. YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But this is 2 month after mariage and  week after a terrible accident with her new husband still in the hospital ( i assume based on the shored timeframe and him not being in the conversation) Ofcourse she has doubts about the rest of her life, ofcourse she feels unsecure and ofcourse she should not be held accountable for what she is saying right now but you are doing just that, and not just that you do that by saying terrible things to her.\n\nyou and your friends should be there now to help them, to help her, and not push her away. make sure she gets the therapy she needs, that they get the therapy they need", "NTA!
