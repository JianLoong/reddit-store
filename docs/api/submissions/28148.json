When my husband met me, I had 2 dogs who were my LIFE. In fact, dogs have pretty much always been my life and the first thing I did when I moved out of my parents house was get the dogs I had always dreamed of. My husband said one of the things that attracted him to me was my dogs. \n\nI\u2019ve worked in animal care for 15 years, most of that working with dogs. When my husband proposed, he even included in his proposal that he promised to love all the dogs and animals I could ever want because that\u2019s WHO I AM. I also had reptiles and bunnies when he met me. At our wedding, every speech included comments about my love for animals, and especially my dogs.\n\nRecently we lost my heart dog due to old age and my heart feels empty. We still have my female dog who is 12 but declining and she is not really a family dog. She likes to be alone. The kids and I feel ready to bring another companion into our lives, but my husband is saying he wants to wait possibly a few YEARS to get another dog. I don\u2019t think I can do that! Having a dog companion is part of who I am, part of who I\u2019ve always been. I feel that 6months after the passing of our boy should be sufficient.\n\nSince we\u2019ve been married, he has been against any animal I\u2019ve wanted to bring into our home. It was a massive fight to get a bunny after I lost my last one, and equally as much of a fight to add a couple chickens to our back yard. I feel like he said those words to me back then and didn\u2019t mean it, and I can\u2019t control my need to live a life with lots of animals around me. He has not been understanding towards our dogs geriatric issues and needs as he never had a dog survive to old age in his home growing up. When I ask him why he doesn\u2019t want another dog he just says he \u201cjust doesn\u2019t and thinks we should take an extended break from dogs\u201d.  \n\nSo, WIBTA if I bring home a dog despite his wishes not to get another one?\n\n** edit to clear up a couple things:\nWe had five small chickens but after a fox attack only have 1, and it\u2019s leaving in a few weeks to live at my friends actual farm. All we currently have for animals other than that one chicken is our one senior dog, and one house bunny who is clean, litter trained and behaves like a cat. Our senior dog is in no way being pushed aside. She is an odd ball who has always required special management and in no way would her life change with a new addition. She has an entire floor our house just for her to relax and escape the chaos of our home. She\u2019s taken for a 3 mile run every day which tires her out and then she relaxes on the couch in the home office with my husband and hardly moves or makes a sound after that. She\u2019s very comfortable and happy.", "created_utc": 1696347039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yuz6v/wibta_if_i_got_a_dog_against_my_husbands_wishes/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How easy is it to manage household cleanliness with the kids *and* that many pets?  What are your family's needs that will be put on hold to accommodate another dog?\n\nI adore my pets, but I also have tried to be careful about what we bring into our home and how we keep animals so that it is not overwhelming to my spouse.  Chickens are fun and sweet, but they will shit in absolutely everything and prefer tables and chairs, patios and decks to perch on rather than the lawn.  They love to dust bathe in flowerbeds and will absolutely destroy landscaping in chunks if allowed to roam instead of being limited to a run.\n\nDepending on how yours are kept, they might be very easy, clean, and low maintenance pets, or they could be a foul smelling, high maintenance, and destructive influence on your home.\n\nSame for rabbits.  They can be easy or very high maintenance and smelly depending on the setup.  My reptiles have a bioactive enclosure and need once a week cleaning/water changes and occasional monitoring to make sure they have enough gut loaded food and haven't completely devoured the cleaning crew. A different set up or different reptile might require daily cleaning and still stink.\n\nHow possible is it for you to pick up and leave on a weekend trip with the kids?  Can you go camping overnight without needing extensive plans for pets, even if you take the dog with you?\n\nBecause it's possible he had a 180 personality shift, but it's more likely that he's burned out and frustrated that his needs come behind the pets' wants.  Pets should be a two yes/one no situation.  There shouldn't have to be a fight to *not* have to add another pet.  Particularly ones that take up lots of space and cause property damage, like chickens.", "YTA. You have three pets and two kids. It sounds like he might be overwhelmed. That\u2019s a lot! Adding another creature to the mix requires a \u201cyes\u201d from both spouses.", "YWBTA.\n\nNo matter the back story is right now you are a married couple and both of you should find common ground before making such a decision. If you bring a dog in the family home when he doesn't want, do you think it's gonna go well? This will create fights and the kids are not stupid, they will realize that the fight is about the dog, the dog they wanted. It's not better for the dog, they will feel the energy and that can stress them out.\n\nThere is a problem between you and your husband about animal and you need to put your big girl pants and talk through it with your husband instead of doing the passive aggressive things and bringing a dog in this situation. It's for the sake of your marriage, yourself, kids and dogs.\n\nTalk to him about his apparent change of heart. Figure out if he lied to you in the past or if something change over the years. We are all free to change what we want, he didn't necessarily lied to you. And if he try to weasel out of this without answering, force him. Because honestly this could be a big deal for the marriage, it's probably not a good idea to just swept this under the rug.", "INFO - You speak with so much love of your pets, but not so much of your husband.  Are your pets more important to you than him?  Wy are you in counselling? \n\nI am not trying to be nasty here, that's a genuine question. Does your husband actually get any of your time and attention or are you only focusing on your animals and children?  Because it sounds like he was onboard before the kids came along, but not so much now.\n\nBecause not wanting a puppy when you have a rabbit, a difficult dog that isn't a family pet but requires a lot of upkeep and expenses, two kids and a marriage in trouble isn't unreasonable.  \n\nI completely understand your need to have a dog in your life, but I think you would be ending your marriage if you did it without your husband's approval.", "I feel like the change in levels of responsibility is a valid reason for your husband to have changed his mind, especially since your children are still very young. I\u2019m currently in my third trimester and have two dogs who I absolutely ADORE but couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine adding a fourth living creature into that equation. However, assuming this is the case, he should be communicating that clearly with you so that you can reach a compromise e.g. once both children are in full time school and so have less hours at home that may be a better time to introduce a new pet, or perhaps it would be easier to adopt a slightly older dog rather than a puppy who will need more immediate looking after/cleaning up after. Also if you have both discussed having more children in future, that may play into it. \n\nYou would definitely be the asshole though if you brought an animal into the home without his consent - it will cause friction in your relationship, and so your children, and wouldn\u2019t be fair on the new dog, either. He\u2019s also the asshole if he continues to be unwilling to communicate or compromise.", "The contrast between this:\n\n> I\u2019ve worked in animal care for 15 years, most of that working with dogs. When my husband proposed, he even included in his proposal that he promised to love all the dogs and animals I could ever want because that\u2019s WHO I AM.

So you should probably talk about this with him after deciding how important it is to you and whether it's a dealbreaker for you two going forward", "I wanna say YTA. I love animals and have friends who love animals but your seeming all caps NEED for them is kind of unsettling and seems like it borders on an unhealthy obsession. Y\u2019all also have kids now which is enough to deal with; maybe your husband just doesn\u2019t want to be bogged down with all the extra pets that need extra attention at the moment even if it\u2019s your attention.", "YWTHA. It honestly sounds as if your animals are a bigger priority than your children and husband. He stated that it was your love for animals that made him fall in love with you. Maybe he was expecting a little more of that love to be shown to him. I'm just speculating here, and please don't think I'm judging you. I'm just trying to let you see this possibly from his perspective as it seems to be the one thing you've omitted. He may also be grieving for the loss of your last dog, and not ready for another. \n\nEither way, bringing another life, weather it be human or animal or fish into a relationship without both parties being on board would make you an AH.", "There is a lot of work with owning a pet, let alone the mini farm you are currently caring for AND two young children. \n\nAre you able to fully manage your time? A geriatric dog\u2019s needs gets messy, how has this worked with two small kids? How about your husband? Is he part of this whole thing?\n\nI had a good friend who had a lot of resentment against his mum because she loved animals to the point her human family was less of a priority than the pets. \n\nYou need to sit down with your husband and talk about balance. LISTEN to his concerns. \n\nYWBTA and exceedingly disrespectful to get a dog against his wishes. And I\u2019d add as an animal lover, it would be very self centered to bring in a new dog at this time, and just mean to your 12 year old pup", "YWBTA...Quite simply, the number one rule of bringing any animal into the household is that ALL members must agree. I'm not saying I think your husband is acting wonderfully, but there are likely other issues at play in this relationship and bringing another animal into a house where it's not totally wanted is not the right decision.", "Doing anything against your partners wishes does indeed make you an AH.", "You WBTAH if you bring another animal into an environment where it is resented by your partner.  You mentioned dogs, but you also have a bunny and chickens.  Perhaps you can compromise on one animal rather than a hobby farm.   You can also train a dog that a certain part of the house is not its territory so your partner has an animal free space to go to.", "YWBTA\n\nI understand that you both talked about your love for animals when you got together, but bringing in an additional animal without a compromise or the other partner knowing is an asshole move. \n\n My ex partner did this to me. I have an absolute love for animals, ABSOLUTE LOVE! My ex brought in a puppy dog when I was recovering from the loss of a cat I had for 17 years, newly found medical issues, attempting to train a newish dog, going through extended family issues from both sides, and going through our own immediate family issues. Even though he asked about a dog, I told him NO, now was not the time, we cannot handle it. He brought the dog in anyway, by surprise. I took on 95% of the work of taking care of it and training. It added on to my medical and family stress and is one of the reasons why he is my ex. \n\n I love this dog and am still the sole caretaker, but things would've been a lot easier if he listened to me. Bringing in this dog, by surprise without listening to me, showed me he does not respect my opinion, feelings, and love me as a person. Please continue to talk it out and wait until you both are at a sturdier point in the relationship to handle a dog, together, not just by yourself.", "Honestly. Sounds like you like animals around you rather than \u201cyour\u201d animals. It seems like you replace them soon after they pass or at least try to if he don\u2019t stop you. You say your dog likes to be alone, so you want another? But she\u2019s never alone either?", "YWBTA. You already have one dog, multiple chickens, and a rabbit. These are not small responsibilities. The idea of getting *another*  animal explicitly against your partner's wishes is absolutely unacceptable. \n\nListen, I'm a dog guy. I get it. My house isn't complete without a dog. But putting the additional stress of an unknown dog on your family (including on your elderly and solitary dog) solely to make yourself happy at the expense of others isn't okay. Getting any animal is something you both have to agree on.", "YWBTA Comeback to reality. Did you marry the damn animals or your husband? It\u2019s seems he\u2019s obliged you enough, get a grip lady.", "**YWBTA.** Currently, this is a NAH situation. You guys need to continue talking to come up with some type of comporomise. If you do follow through with your plans to make a move before you two can come up with a compromise, YWBTA.\n\nBringing in another member of the household (a new dog) is a huge undertaking and will impact the entire family dynamic. Yes you have a history of having dogs, but that doesn't mean you get to unilaterally bring in a new dog if one passes. **Each pet is a unique addtion, a decision based on the needs/wants of the family at that time.** I mean, when your kids move out do you get to unilaterally decide to adopt a child because you have always had and wanted children?", "YWBTA.  It sounds like you don't really care about your pets as much as you say you do from your behavior.  \"We still have my female dog who is 12 but declining and she is not really a family dog. She likes to be alone.\"  So as soon as one gets old, you get a new one to play with while ignoring the old one.  You have a 3 and 5 year-old.  No wonder the dog wants to be alone.  You have busy and possibly not nice kids around a senior pet.  Do you really expect a senior pet to want to play with rambunctious kids?  If you cared about your existing pet, you would not saddle this old dog with dealing with a new dog just so you can ignore the old one more.  This is also incredibly ironic coming from you, \"He has not been understanding towards our dogs geriatric issues .....\"  You are not understanding to your dog's geriatric issues either.  You only care about what you and the kids want.  You are teaching them that old pets are disposable and do not deserve kind gentle love and space when they are old.", "YTA your in too much of a rush to get pets. You have a dog, a chicken, and a rabbit plus a 3 and 5 year old. Why not wait until the kids are older before adding another pet so they can help with the care? At the time you had 5 chickens there were also two dogs and a rabbit, that's 8 pets plus two young kids that 2 adults have to look after.\n\nThat's a lot of work and it makes sense why husband is putting a foot down. Plus your senior dog may not take well to a younger dog being up in her space suddenly. It doesn't feel like you've really thought this through.", "YTA. Bringing a new member into the family is not a decision to be made unilaterally. It sounds like your husband is still grieving the dog who recently passed, and you're eager to push on and get a new one while he's not there yet. As an aside if your other dog likes to be alone, they might not appreciate a new dog in the home. If that dog is elderly, I think your husband has the right idea to let that dog live out its peaceful next few years and then get another dog once you're all emotionally ready. You'd be a huge AH if you forced this onto your partner against their wishes.", "YWBTA. That could be a signal to him that you value the animals more than him. Also:\n\n>The kids and I feel ready\n\nYour kids are 3 and 5. They are \"ready\" to be a dinosaur tomorrow if you told them it was possible. You feel ready; don't drag them into this. \n\nLast thing: saying your husband lied or baited you on this topic, isn't the most likely answer that, after at least 10 years of living with a menagerie of animals and now raising 2 small children, he'd like some time without adding to the collection? You say he'd never had a dog live to old age, so now he's gone through that and maybe HE isn't ready to bring another dog in. You're grieving, isn't it possible he is too?", "Info : is this really fair to the 12 yo dog?", "ESH - Your kids are really young and its not like he was trying to be devious, no one knows what its like to be a parent until they are.  Sounds like he is struggling with his current responsibilities.\n\nI spent 6 months taking care of my very loved corgi when she had cancer and  my spouse and i rotated nights sleeping on the couch so we could be available to let her out and the other could get a full night sleep.  Before she was sick with cancer she had other issues. Now we only have her brother who is easy as pie, but I dont want another dog right now and in the future i will want a year or 2 off because as much as I love my dogs and having a dog without a break i would not be present and responsible dog parent.\n\nI think you are minimizing your husbands feeling of having 2 young kids, one elderly dog still around a bunny and a chicken, and dealing with the loss of the other dog.\n\nIts not like you have no animals you have a dog and a bunnycat, I think thats a good compromise for now until the kids are older.", "\"I can\u2019t control my need to live a life with lots of animals around me.\"  \n\n\nYTA . And get help.", "NAH. When our senior dog passed after having her from a puppy, the kids and I wanted to get another dog fairly quickly because we missed our girl and loved having a dog in the family. My husband was suddenly vehemently against another dog. Dead set against it. Wanted to wait at least 2 years. I couldn\u2019t understand it, since he also grew up having dogs. I actually had a private, gentle conversation with him (away from the kids) to see what was happening. Turns out he was so heartbroken over doggo\u2019s passing that he didn\u2019t want to think about loving another animal so soon. After a lot of respectful conversations we agreed on a respectful (but relatively short) period before we got our new girl. And guess who loves her to death?\nTry talking privately.", "YTA, your lives have changed due to the 2 tiny humans that you have created. 3 and 5 are busy ages, And your husband may be doing all that he can to keep up with just the humans in your life. Give it some time, wait for your kids to get a little older. Appreciate what your husband does contribute to your family, reading between the lines he sounds like a pretty solid guy. Otherwise you may end up with animals and kids but no husband.", "YTA - I don\u2019t think you can knowingly make a decision that angers your supposed partner and not be the AH. I think both of you need to sit down after the kids go to bed and hash it out. One if you won\u2019t get your way but hopefully you both compromise and most importantly you\u2019re not sneaking around behind his back. You\u2019re an adult. Act like it.", "Seriously, at least wait until your elderly dog passes on so she can have a peaceful last few years. \n\nYTA if you get a dog because that would be the worst decision for your current dog. If your husband wants to wait years based on that, I get it.\n\nEditing to say, other pets like bunnies and things I don't see his problem with, but maybe there's an underlying issue with finances, for example. You need a frank discussion.", "LOL why are you asking this? You would obviously be the asshole if you went behind your partners back and brought home a pet. If my wife did this I would be incredibly furious. \n\nYou know this is the wrong thing to do or you wouldn't be on Reddit trying to get random strangers to validate you. \n\nYour husband's priorities have changed after having two small children in his house. Instead of trying to force him to accept your decision without his consent, go see a marriage counselor and find out if there is a middle ground you can both accept.", "YTA. It seems you aren\u2019t adequately sharing how over the top you are about pets and he is drawing the line. Suggesting you lost your \u201cheart\u201d dog is sufficient evidence that you are the one who is in the wrong here.", "Info: how many pets do you currently have other than the dog? How many pets would you have if your husband hadn't been saying no?", "YWBTA. I say that with sympathy because I understand your feelings and I would be resentful towards your husband as well. You\u2019re not an AH for thinking it should be ok. I even personally agree with you wanting a do. But ultimately, it\u2019s unfair to bring kids or animals into a situation where they aren\u2019t wanted by you and your husband. \n\nEven if you\u2019re willing to do all the work, dogs cost money. They also dictate schedules. You have to account for their needs. You\u2019re either coming home to let dogs out or arranging someone else to. You\u2019re either getting a pet friendly vacation or paying for boarding/pet sitting. Your husband has lived with the reality of this and now knows he\u2019s not on board. Seeing someone from the outside while dating enjoy their life with young, healthy dogs isn\u2019t the same as living with aging dogs with rising health needs and costs along with other animals and small children. So even though it\u2019s emotionally hurtful for you, I do understand why your husband has different feelings now. \n\nYou have to ask yourself if it\u2019s a dealbreaker for you. If it\u2019s truly something you need to make you happy then that is your call. But unilaterally brining living creatures into the marital home just isn\u2019t ok. \n\nTo me this is similar to situations where people talk about how many kids they want. You have every right not to settle but even if someone \u201cpromises\u201d they are ok with a certain number (or any at all), it\u2019s just not something you can tell someone to deal with because they promised. Kids, dogs, cats etc. deserve lives full of love, care, and acceptance. If someone in your home can\u2019t provide that, it\u2019s not the right home. But talk to your husband. I\u2019d make sure there\u2019s not a specific issue (cost, aggression from an existing dog towards kids, lack of obedience training etc.) you could resolve for him that would make him comfortable with the idea.", "YWBTA, but you need to have a long-needed sit down with your husband and find out what gives.  He said, when you got engaged and married, that he understood your desire to be a dog owner and he loved all the more.  He needs to explain himself and stop with the arguments.  If he says he changed his mind, let him know that this is not something you will accommodate.  If he feels that having another dog is a deal-breaker, break the deal.  You are unhappy and there is no need to be.  If he wants to bail because of a new dog, then let him.  He needs to realize that this isn't something separate and apart from you, but a vital part of you and him causing issues is causing you to re-evaluate your whole marriage.  He needs to realize he is destroying his family and needs to figure it out.", "Yta honestly doing what you want against your partners wishes is never a good idea. \n\nDon\u2019t be upset if this is the straw that breaks the camels back. You guys need to work together and you should know his argument inside and out. The lack of communication and compromise is a huge issue", "YWBTA. Look, there is nothing in the world I love more than my senior (13yo) girl, but even small dogs can be expensive (she's only 6.5kg/14lb). I've probably dropped $3k on her in the past year just to care for her geriatric issues & that doesn't include the cost of food, teeth cleaning, toys, treats, etc. Luckily my boyfriend and I don't plan on having kids so I have absolutely no guilt about doing so. But if I also has 2 young kids? Yeah, I'd probably still spend the money but it would be *a lot* more difficult of a decision. \n\nTbh, I don't blame your husband if he agreed in theory to running a small animal farm without realizing how expensive they can be, especially when they get old. I've even been surprised by how much she's costing me (not that I would ever stop giving her the best care possible). but unless you've had a geratric animal or even just had multiple animals at once, it's nearly impossible to understand the emotional and financial burden.\n\nMy advice is to talk to your husband, establish his concerns clearly. If you just want another dog, ask if he would be opened for \\**fostering*\\* for a few years (therefore not committing to anything long term). If some of his concerns are financial, do some research into costs, BOTH into the predicted costs of your current pup over the next few years and the additional costs of adding a new dog into the mix. See if there's anything on the table that you two could compromise on, but absolutely DO NOT make this decision unilaterally because that's absolutely disrespectful to the relationship and a terrible environment to bring a dog into.", "Yta.", "YWBTA. It wouldn't be fair to the dog to bring it into a home where its presence is resented. Maybe offer your husband something in exchange for a dog, like a weekend away with his friends or something. Just keep tempting him with something he wants until he can't resist. Where there's a will there's a way.", "i don\u2019t want kids & love dogs, so my instinct is to tell you to rehome the kids & get 5 more dogs. but yeah, YWBTA if you try to get a pet with one adult in a partnership refusing to do any of the work with it. that\u2019s never a sustainable plan.  \nmaybe he\u2019ll change his mind when the kids are more independent. as much as i love doggies, a toddler and puppy would be way too much for me.  \nmaybe he\u2019ll be easier to convince later. maybe this is a dealbreaker & you want to consider leaving now. but don\u2019t get another pet until he is on board.", "Based on the title, I was originally going to say that YWBTA because it is generally massively disrespectful to get a pet like a dog without both partners agreeing.  But after reading the full story, and knowing that you all lived with dogs for so long, I think you are entitled to get another dog.  As a dog lover, I can't imagine living without at least one dog.  The 2 weeks between my first dog passing and us getting our next dog were absolutely horrible.  He knew what he was signing up for - he really can't change his mind at this point!", "Edit: Changed to YWNBTA based on OP replies. Yes it is potentially an AH move, but not in proportion with the husband's AH-ness. OP is willing to do all care for the dog and the husband doesn't seem to have any good reason for being an AH about it.\n______________________________________________\nE.S.H. - I don't know how to give the right judgment here, because right now your husband is coming off as the TA but if you go behind his back it turns firmly into E.S.H.. You asked \"WIBTA\" so I have to judge based on that, and I think that if you go behind his back \"EWSH,\" but that's not a valid rating. Hence E.S.H.\n\n From what you've said, he went back on his word and is preventing you from obtaining the one thing that makes you truly happy - a dog that is a reliable companion. \n\nI feel like there has to be more to this story. So what changed? \n\nHow many/what kind of animals did you have when you got married? How many/what kind do you have now? \"A couple chickens\" is a much bigger investment of time and energy for the entire family than dogs, rabbits, and reptiles.\n\nHas your husband expressed why things have changed? Does he have some complaint?

When my husband met me, I had 2 dogs who were my LIFE. In fact, dogs have pretty much always been my life and the first thing I did when I moved out of my parents house was get the dogs I had always dreamed of. My husband said one of the things that attracted him to me was my dogs. \n\nI\u2019ve worked in animal care for 15 years, most of that working with dogs. When my husband proposed, he even included in his proposal that he promised to love all the dogs and animals I could ever want because that\u2019s WHO I AM. I also had reptiles and bunnies when he met me. At our wedding, every speech included comments about my love for animals, and especially my dogs.\n\nRecently we lost my heart dog due to old age and my heart feels empty. We still have my female dog who is 12 but declining and she is not really a family dog. She likes to be alone. The kids and I feel ready to bring another companion into our lives, but my husband is saying he wants to wait possibly a few YEARS to get another dog. I don\u2019t think I can do that! Having a dog companion is part of who I am, part of who I\u2019ve always been. I feel that 6months after the passing of our boy should be sufficient.\n\nSince we\u2019ve been married, he has been against any animal I\u2019ve wanted to bring into our home. It was a massive fight to get a bunny after I lost my last one, and equally as much of a fight to add a couple chickens to our back yard. I feel like he said those words to me back then and didn\u2019t mean it, and I can\u2019t control my need to live a life with lots of animals around me. He has not been understanding towards our dogs geriatric issues and needs as he never had a dog survive to old age in his home growing up. When I ask him why he doesn\u2019t want another dog he just says he \u201cjust doesn\u2019t and thinks we should take an extended break from dogs\u201d.  \n\nSo, WIBTA if I bring home a dog despite his wishes not to get another one?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Ywbta.

They are *not* meant to be without other bunnies", "Originally I was thinking it would be wrong of you. But after reading the whole story, it seems your husband has gone back on what he said. Did he lie in order to marry you and then figure he could just refuse? That sounds manipulative and I would feel deceived. There is a chance he just changed his mind over the years but still\u2026 he should be a man of his word.", "YWBTA if you got a dog against the wishes of the other adult in the home. It really should be a mutual YES decision.\n\nHowever, I would say it warrants a conversation as to what changed, why he's against it when he knows how important it is to you, and always has been.", "ESH. \n\nYou are clearly a big animal person and your husband promised to love that side of you. While I respect that things can change, he clearly doesn't have a very good explanation for why he suddenly has a problem with it and that's unfair to you.\n\nHowever, based on your comments about all the comforts you are giving your old dog (which I think is wonderful), then I also think you do not understand how exhausting that can be for someone who doesn't feel as strongly as you do towards animals. If I had to reserve an entire floor for my husband's dog, I think I'd go insane. And I consider myself quite a big animal person. I think it's great you are protecting your dog and making its life comfortable, but you also have to realise that even with you doing the work, it does also have a significant impact on his life. \n\nI do not know your husband, but maybe he's worried that a dog with behavioural issues might harm the kids one day. Maybe he spends a lot of energy worrying about possible scenarios. Maybe he is worried if you get a new dog and it has issues then he knows that you'd never give it up, no matter how bad those issues were. I fully understand his hesitation. However, he should be open about that with you. If I were you, I'd ask specific questions. \n\nYou shouldn't bring a dog home without your husband being on board, no, because that would make you an asshole. But you are entitled to a real answer from him. Communicate. Perhaps a compromise could be that you wait until your other dog has passed. You still have a bunny and two small humans to care for. Maybe after a good honest talk, he might be willing to get a new dog soon. You might have to promise him that if the new dog doesn't fit into your family, you have to make other arrangements for it. I think that's fair. \n\nI do not know what dog you'd want, but I know that puppies are a hell of a lot of work and that terrifies people. Rescuing an older dog might seem more manageable for him.", "I think he said everything before he realized what the words meant. I think YWBTA if you got a pet against his wants but I also doubt that a few years will be enough time for him. He will never want a dog again because he now knows they require responsibility even if you do most of the work. \n\nYou will need to decide what is more important to you. A dog or your husband because I don\u2019t think he will ever want a dog again even if he says in a few years.", "Getting a dog? That's a 10-15 years commitment, right? Yeah, why should you include him in that decision? YTA.", "YTA\n\nTake a break from new dogs...enjoy the one you have...when that one goes wait a bit then discuss again.", "YTA. Any pets have to be a joint decision. He isn\u2019t saying you can never have another dog. He just said wait a few years. Your kids are young! Your other dog is old.

He is letting you down.\n\nI think it would be a mistake that you get a dog without his agreement.  You need to chose between the husband and the dog.", "YWBTA bringing a new dog into the house when he's expressly said no, but he is already TA for his about-face.\n\nI always have two dogs, one younger, one older. When the older one passes, after a mourning period,  I get a younger one and the pattern continues. I made it very very clear to my partner before they moved in that dogs were part of the package, and if they'd reneged on that I would be evaluating the relationship. BUT we're not married and don't have kids together. Being married changes the maths, and having kids changes the maths A LOT.\n\nI can see this becoming a source of resentment whichever way it goes - either you resent your hubby for his about face, or he resents you for bringing an unwanted (in his eyes) dog into the house. Whatever happens it could break your relationship.\n\nI really hope you can discuss things and work it out, but I can't see a compromise you'll both be happy with. I hope I'm wrong.", "Sorry, but YWBTA if you brought a new dog in without consent of your husband.\n\na.  It is HIS home also.\n\nb. It is not fair to the pet to have someone who resent the pet in the house.  \n\nc. Your husband may still be grieving your last dog.  People grieve differently.  I would have felt it so disrespectful replacing our dog only six months after her passed (14 YO).  18 months down the line, it was a different story.  \n\nd.  Your husband may feel overwhelmed with the thought of another being to take care of at this time.  Yes, you had dogs prior to marriage, but now you have kids, a rabbit, and a chicken.  Lots of bodies.  Small dog or large, it is still something that requires care.\n\ne.  While you can take it to work, there is still care that needs to be done.  Maybe he feels it is too much.\n\nf.  Having a senior dog still, even if it is not a \"family\" dog, requires care and tending.  Additional costs might be an issue, also your husband may see this a being too hard on the older dog.  A young dog, even with limited interaction, can be very hard on an older dog.\n\nOverall...TALK to him.  See if he never wants another dog, or just wants to wait until things are more settled down or your other dog has passed over the rainbow bridge.", "My God you sound insufferable about dogs. \n\nBut anyway, dogs require 2 yeses and even though i think your husband is taking back what he initially said and is slightly an AH for saying no, I think YWBTA if you got one when he doesn't agree.\n\nA young dog with small children is going to be a handful as well, so that's something to think about, also. Whereas it seems you've only experienced caring for older dogs with young kids.", "YTA\n\nTo be honest it doesn't sound like OP is mature enough to understand why her husband wants less animals. He sounds tired. You came into the relationship with animals, but now you have two kids, an elderly dog who requires round the clock companionship and you've had the recent death of a dog and four chickens. That is a hell of a lot of emotional things to be going through. OP you said you need the animals to be happy, but you haven't said anything about what you husband needs to be happy. The consideration of obtaining a dog behind your husbands back is childish and unfair. \n\nYou can't just decide to buy an animal because you want it, you're married, that isn't an option anymore. You and your husband need to hash out how he is feeling about everything rather than continuously asking for a new pet. Three animals is a lot for most people in addition to two children, you are not most people in regards to pet ownership. However, your husband might be, it may not be a situation of him deceiving you and more his own needs are being ignored. This is a discussion where compromise may be needed. We all have wants and needs and it appears he has compromised in the past with animals, but what have you done to compromise with him?

He was all willing to accept your pets at the beginning, but now that you're losing them bit by bit, he's not willing to let you pursue your love of animals? It's time for a serious talk.", "Didn't even get past the title. Yes, YWBTA. A pet is like a kid, it's a 2 yes, 1 no question.", "And this is why I'm happily single. No one wants to put up with my cat zoo. Some days even I don't want to put up with them and I love them with my whole soul.", "YTA. The decision to have animals is one that should be made jointly, or else it can breed resentment. You just going around him to do your own thing would be the equivalent of him surrendering the animals at the pound without you knowing. If you two can\u2019t communicate as a couple to come to an agreement, you need to work on that.", "You need to have a conversation about why he keeps saying no. He must have some reason, even if it is strange logic, so understand that before you do anything.", "I\u2019m more concerned at the fact that you had basically a farm of animals and now only have 3 left. Maybe THATS why he needs a break from the pet sematary. After I loss my dog I didn\u2019t even want to even look at another pup until at least 2 years, some people grieve differently and I personally couldn\u2019t even think about replacing my best friend until I healed and grieved him and even then nobody could compare to him. Yta for your willingness to put your wants above your husbands with no desire of even trying to compromise nor care in understanding his feelings on the situation and also for willing to go behind his back so you can get what you want.", "i don\u2019t even need to read the context. if you bring an animal into someone\u2019s home with out their permission that they have to care, clean and pay for, for no less than 15 years of their life, you are a gigantic gaping asshole point blank period.

If he wasn't on board we wouldn't have them. \n\nAlso, you said in a comment that since having kids, he doesn't want the added responsibility of a pet. He has literally explained a very valid argument against having one. If you wait a year or two like he requested, the kids will be older and a bit easier to manage so a pet would be more manageable at that point.", "YWBTA if you did. He clearly doesn't want to deal with that responsibility right now and that's something you should respect. Just wait a few years and revisit the topic again. And if you're so addicted to adopting animals that it's causing issues in your relationship, you should consider therapy.", "YWBTA. Why do you have to decide to get another dog right this second? Your dog just died, you have an elderly dog. Just relax, enjoy the rest of the time you have with your elder dog, and make plans to get a puppy later. There is no rush. Your husband wants a break and that's okay. He didn't say never, he just said he isn't ready right now and that's okay. I promise you won't die from not getting another dog right now, but I know when you guys both decide you want another dog together it will be the best experience for you, your husband, your children, and the dog. Don't just think about yourself in this, it will be worth the wait until everyone is ready.", "YWBTA for bringing in the dog right at this moment but the quick 180 that your husband turned is the real AH move.

You will absolutely be the asshole for getting a dog without him agreeing and honestly I think you should just drop it now before it puts more strain on your relationship. He might be fine again after a few years of being dog free. Don't force him to make any promises either, he needs to come to terms and accept it on his own time and not be pushed. Dogs are very high maintenance, very needy, and a huge responsibility. If you want to interact with dogs so much then volunteer at a shelter daily. Bringing a dog home to someone who clearly is done with dogs and doesn't want any more is not fair to the dog or to your husband. It's going to create resentment. He's not going to magically fall in love with it over time so don't even think about that possibility. I'm serious, drop it now and if you love dogs so much just spend your free time working with them at shelters. Don't bring one home without both parties agreeing.", "YWBTA. You owe it to the animal to get your husband on board and with the program before bringing them into your home.

Six months may be enough for you to process and move on, but it may not be for him. \n\nAlso...

What is your travel and family vacations like?  This may be where the issue lies because traveling while having animals takes its toll.  I rarely see my parents because they have a dog that will only let 1-2 people watch him and has issues at the kennel (Heart issues).  My wife and I have 2 dogs and have issues finding someone to watch one of them because of their breed (Staffy) even though she has some better behavior than our Corgi.  Also the cost of the dogs healthcare has gone up over the years and he may not want to trade all the vacation savings on a surgical procedure.  Just throwing it out he may have things he wants for the family that has been stopped by the pets.", "YWBTA. It should be a mutual decision. He is allowed to change his mind regarding owning several pets, especially after having 2 kids. He might be overwhelmed by responsibility. Or he might be still grieving.

It sounds like you wouldn't be asking him for help with the dog, so I don't understand what his hang-up is.

One free roam rabbit, and one 12 year old Siberian husky. The dog we lost was also a Siberian husky with a WONDERFUL personality. When we got married I also had a bunny and two Guinea pigs who have all passed, two lizards and a snake who have also passed.\n\nI think what changed is he has struggled with the change in responsibility since having kids and doesn\u2019t want any more responsibility. As our boy was getting to the end of his life he was having some geriatric issues like accidents and throwing up, and he would get pissed if he had to clean anything up and started to say that he hated the dogs. Our house is NOT soiled or anything, I\u2019ve always been on top of the animal care and do 99% of what\u2019s needed for their care. He also just doesn\u2019t want to spend any money on animals, although I\u2019ve got my eye on a much smaller breed this time around so less dog food, easier to clean up after, etc\n\nI also mentioned in another comment, I currently work somewhere where I can bring a dog to work with me, so on days when I\u2019m not home, I could have the dog with me. My sister dog sits for us, so it\u2019s not that difficult to leave if we need or want to, And again, I\u2019d be going for a smaller breed to make it easier to travel with if the situation allowed for it.", "INFO: OP said her husband was dealing with addiction issues and outbursts of aggression towards her in another comment.", "It\u2019s really not related but I asked to start counseling after a number of aggressive outbursts towards me, one that became more of a rage episode. It turns out the anger was hiding some lies regarding substance use. We are working through it but it hasn\u2019t been easy and I\u2019ve felt very alone for a number of years now because of it. My animals are not more important to me than him necessarily, but they are a necessity for me to live a happy life and defiantly help me during times when I feel sad and alone. I\u2019ve always been drawn to animals, like I said I\u2019ve worked with them for 15 years, studied them in school, etc etc. it\u2019s just a major part of who I am that will never change. \n\nI try very hard to give my husband attention and listen to his needs in counseling. We have 4 nights a week together and our kids go to bed early, 7pm, so have the whole rest of the night kid free. We are struggling to connect right now but the trying is there.

But he should have known that you'd have atleast one animal at all times and that having no animals is a deal breaker for you. \n\n I work at a holistic pet food store, have some Maine Coons, I'm looking into rescuing and if my boyfriend was anything but supportive it wouldn't work out. He knows that I'm going to open up a sanctuary and my own petstore and knows at the end of the day if he ever said \"me or the animals\" the animals would be chosen first. I've sent him photos of random strays that I'm helping and he knows that one might come home for a bit until I can find a better home. I made a commitment to them before I made a commitment to him and they won't get a second chance like he will.", "I appreciate you at least being friendly in your comment. Although its definitely not true that my animals are a bigger priority than my kids and husband. I am home with my kids all day, I coach my oldest\u2019s soccer team, go to dance class, make special fun lunches every day, do weekly field trips, etc. as my post says, my dogs *were* my life. My family is now. But to me, family includes those with 4 paws, however no dog could ever compare to my children.

And you could not be more wrong with your assumptions. Like I started my post off with, my dogs were the center of my universe for the majority of their lives. Dog sledding, husky meet ups, coming to work with me, traveling all over the state to hike mountains, doing dog training demonstrations\u2026 I could go on and on. After my last rabbit died I went 8 years without getting another and never replaced my reptiles after they passed.

It sounds like for the most part he hasn't let OP get any new pets besides the bunny and a couple chickens, whereas quite a lot of them have passed away. \n\nI'm not saying he doesn't have his reasons with 2 small children, but it sounds like he married someone with oodles of animals to the point he made it part of his vows or whatever, and then flipped the script.

Don\u2019t be a selfish asshole and get another one behind his back. \n\nThe fact that you are even considering this put\u2019s you in AH territory for me.

I can\u2019t even begin to go into details about all that\u2019s gone into giving her a safe an happy life. Our house is divided into 3 floors, the bottom floor being a home office and strictly her area of the house where she can go and not be bothered but she is with someone all day, never alone. Our kids are phenomenal with her. I am a dog trainer in my career and work with families to teach their children how to respect their dogs, and my kids 100% understand how to behave around her. We go to a dog friendly brewery every week (our old girl can\u2019t come because it\u2019s off leash only and as a husky she can\u2019t be trusted off leash) but my kids have a chance every week to practice their K9 etiquette.

We would continue to dedicate this space to her for her comfort, she would not be forced to spend extended periods of time with the puppy.

I have other dogs currently but will not be adding another when she passes because I need a mental reset from that much emotional and mental labor.

I wasn't going to originally comment on this but then when you mentioned BOTH dogs were huskies...that tipped it for me. Those types of dogs are exactly like children and are so freaking overwhelming - I know that because my husband came with one and it drives me up the wall. So you had two huskies - yes older now, but they weren't always- have kids, and some other animals. Yes it sounds like the other animals have declined but that dude is probably incredibly exhausted. I am not a dog person and his husky has really pushed me over the edge - that type of dog is not easy for a non dog lover to like.  I do tolerate the husky for my husband because I have to - but he's responsible for all dog related things and he knows the dog overwhelms me with it's loudness, hair everywhere and neediness. You really need to learn to compromise here - certainly sounds like he did when you came with all those animals.  As mean as this will sound he probably wants to wipe the slate clean and take a breath before the chaos starts again. Compromise on a break time and maybe even ask him if he wants to pick the breed the next time? I know that when my husband's husky goes --- I want to take a breath.

Huskies are NOT a low effort breed.  Even the best behaved husky is a LOT of work.  So are kids.\n\nI can't blame your spouse for feeling burnt out right now.  Also, losing a pet after watching them suffer for a slow decline is very emotionally difficult.  Even people who have always wanted loads of pets may struggle with the idea of getting another dog after the death of a dog they loved.  Grief is hard.\n\nYWBTA if you forced another dog on him right now.\n\nMaybe he does just want a break from the animals for a few years.  Maybe you should take a break from pets and revisit this when the kids are a little older.  3 and 5 are terrible ages to be introducing a small, easily damaged when dropped dog anyways.

Caring for pets is also costly and your husband may not be eager to take on more financial obligations. \n\nHe didn't say he'd never want to get another dog (or other pets), just that he isn't ready *now*. If you ignore this and get a dog behind his back, he is rightly going to be upset with you because you are dismissing his concerns and putting your own wants before his, despite his protests. You won't perish if you have to wait a couple years to get another dog, but your marriage might if you continue to ignore your husband's concerns.\n\nHave an honest conversation with him and come up with a compromise. Maybe he wants to wait a couple years and you want one now, but are you willing to asses your financial and domestic situation a year from now and, if things are stable, then get another dog? What kind of dog would make both of you happy as far as cost of care and responsibility levels? How would you fairly split caring for the dog?

I would ask him why he won't support you, because it is so important to you and he *promised.* If he has a good reason, listen and see if you can compromise.\n\nTBH, in this particular situation, if that fails I would explain to him that you ARE going to get a (couple of?) dog(s) and he can either be involved in that activity with you and the kids or not. It would still be an AH move, but its a bigger AH move to go back on your word and prevent you from getting something you clearly told him you need, especially when the cost to him is miniscule since you are willing to handle all of the care of the dogs in order to get him on board. I'll change my vote in my OP because I your potential AH-ness is drowned out by his active AH-ness.\n\nI guess my last question would be: are you strapped for cash, such that $100/mo in dog food and other care will be a burden?\n\nI only asked about big indoor birds and ferrets because those are game changers (noise and smell), but obviously irrelevant to this situation.", "People change as life progresses.  Labeling him a \"liar\" is a cheap shot.", "You said in another comment that your spouse resented having to clean up after your late pet\u2019s accidents, but here you say you do all their care. So which is it? How are chores normally split in your house? Is there an issue with mismatched standards of cleanliness? (I\u2019ve noticed a lot of my animal lover friends don\u2019t notice the mess, hair, and smell associated with their pets. Animals track in a lot of dirt and create messes). It sounds like you have a lot going on right now and your spouse isn\u2019t in a good place emotionally. I would respect that he doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth for more responsibility right now and hold off.", "Well, if the marriage counseling doesn't work, you get to keep the dog without a custody fight, so there's that benefit.\n\nTo be charitable, maybe he just didn't realize how much work animals are (totally worth it) and wasn't lying to you at the beginning, but he needs to understand you can't live without them, no matter how much work they are.", "You're willing to cause issues in your marriage because you're unwilling to wait a few years to get another dog. Think about that for a moment.", "Yup, a dog is 2 yes 1 no. If hubby doesn't want a pet, it's no pet or no hubby", "I\u2019ve already agreed we will not be getting another husky and am looking at a much smaller, lower maintenance family dog. Our senior dog is essentially a couch potato now, she goes for a 3 mile run and spends the rest of the day sleeping but I do understand they are a lot to handle and he lived with them for 3 years before making that proposal to me. As it is, I already care for the animals by myself and pay for everything they need. I could also bring the new dog to work with me on the weekends. Also editing to add, I didn\u2019t \u201ccome with all of those animals\u201d, he CHOSE me with all of those animals, knowingly. He met me when I managed a freaking pet store and had my own dog training business lol I was bringing home animals all the time to care for if they were sick on injured from the day he met me. It wasn\u2019t something I hid that he suddenly had to decide to live with. He knew this loooooong before we moved in together or got married.", "He has agreed to counseling but that\u2019s it. A lot of this was influence from old \u201cfriends\u201d he used to be close with who took a different path in life and never got married or had children. A piece of him misses that old life where he could party and \u201cenjoy\u201d lots of different substances without repercussion or responsibilities holding him down.", "I planned to get 2 and my husband prevented me from getting the second", "I didn\u2019t say he\u2019s abusive. I said it\u2019s something to watch out for. I said *I personally* wouldn\u2019t risk it. People tend to share personal experiences on Reddit. We see animal abuse on Reddit daily, unfortunately. I just replied to a post regarding an abusive situation yesterday.\n\nI\u2019ve been divorced from the guy for 19 years and he\u2019s not alive anymore. I have nothing about this to *project.*", "I did answer this in another comment. I was a SAHM for the first 4 years and now I work nights and weekends but I\u2019m still home with my kids all day. I coach soccer, take my other to dance, take them to school, pack their lunches, sort their clothes and do their laundry, I\u2019m doing the 1000 hour outside challenge with them this year. Being a parent is my top priority. The animals are not as much work as people are making them sound. The 5 bantam chickens required a small coop that was easy to clean and they free ranged which made them even easier. Our rabbit is a house bunny who is very well behaved and litter trained. Aside from changing the litter box twice a week he\u2019s very low maintenance. Our senior dog goes for a 3 mile run each day and sleeps on the couch pretty much all day long after that. It\u2019s not hard, exhausting, or much time at all.", "No, one dog often isn\u2019t enough! Many dogs do better with other dogs. And if you\u2019ve always had multiple dogs, it\u2019s easier to have multiple dogs. \nWhat about her husband? He seems to be just fine going around her wishes- which he\u2019s known all along. Doesn\u2019t that show how much he cares for her?", "he promised to love all the dogs she would ever get.  he married her with all dogs present and future. his current wishes completely contradict the things he told OP when convincing her to marry him thus making him a snake oil salesman.", "Wanting another dog does not make you an AH, but, when you are part of a family you would be an AH to force the choice on your husband. If you can contain yourself here, maybe your husband will see that maturity and change his mind down the road. In a few years when the kids are older they could be involved in choosing the dog and you could get a family pet. Until then you can give your elderly dog all the love and attention.", "Listen you do you. I\u2019m not convinced and again the fact that you are considering getting one behind your husbands back\nMakes you the AH to me, but hey if you choose to breed resentment into your household that\u2019s on you. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So, during the exactly 0 minutes she's not alone, who is spending time with her? And who will spend time with the new dog?", "I've read through a few of your comments on your senior dog and you really come across like you feel that your older dog has gotten everything she should need, she should be grateful, and now you are going to get a new dog because you deserve one for all the work you've done with her. \n\nI think it would be wise to wait until this dog passes before getting another pet. You've got a full house already from most people's perspectives and  it sounds like your husband would like a break. Marriage is about compromise. 6 months is not very long between dogs, especially since you still have one. The kids opinions on this do not count at all because they are 3 and 5. Listen to your husband, come to an agreement, do not just go out and get a dog.", "At the time I got this dog I was young, single, told I was infertile, and diving deep into the world of dog training. I had the option to give her back or even euthanize her, which was suggested by one trainer at the time. She made drastic improvements over the years and my husband had plenty of time to get to know her and her quirks before deciding to commit to her.", "Thank you!!! These comments don\u2019t shake me. As I said, I\u2019ve worked in animal care for 15 years. I\u2019m regularly surrounded by likeminded individuals and I\u2019d say 95% of them have more animals than I do.", "The point is that in your comment you use \"WE\". Like \"we both wanted\". That's the point. You did what was right for both of you and your remaining dog,so you all were on board. Op's family is divided. She only screams in this post ME, ME, ME, I WANT.", "Tell your husband how you feel. It sounds like you have resement that has been building and because of that it\u2019s has you debating passing that resentment on to him. \n\n\u201c hubby, I love you and I understand that everyone grieves on different timelines. However lately it feels like you have been restricting my ability to love multiple animals. I\u2019m starting to feel resentment towards this matter. I don\u2019t want to make a rash decision but I need us to find a compromise. A few years is too long for me, can we finishing the year (6 additional months ) and opening the topic back up for discussion? I don\u2019t want this issue to cause a rift in our marriage but I am no longer putting my desires aside to only fit your timeline. If we can\u2019t come To an agreement we will need to further discuss moving forward as a couple.\u201d\nCommunication and boundaries are needed. Not reddit determining wether you would be an Asshole for undermining your husband.", "Let\u2019s be clear, she shouldn\u2019t get a dog in the current situation because you shouldn\u2019t bring an animal into an environment where it isn\u2019t wanted by everyone.\n\nThat being said, the husband has been lying since day one, that\u2019s very clear. He trapped OP into a marriage by repeatedly lying about his intentions. Whether that\u2019s a long term dealbreaker is up to OP to decide.\n\nIf he\u2019s having other issues causing a sincere change, which I doubt, he needs to work with OP to figure that out.", "I can\u2019t see anywhere in the post that says she expects anyone to view the animal the same way. She\u2019s expecting her husband to understand how she feels, not for him to feel the same way.", "She says she\u2019s willing to handle the cares but her spouse was stuck cleaning up after the last dog. I don\u2019t think she is as responsible as she claims to be, especially because she admits her spouse not wanting to add to his responsibilities as his reason for not wanting another dog right now.", "On occasion he did clean up if I wasn\u2019t home rather than just leaving it there but sometimes I\u2019d just tell him to leave it for me. I think our house is pretty well kept all things considered. My mom is highly allergic to pet hair so I keep up with it well so she can visit if she wants to.", "Considering OP admits their current dog is an \"oddball\" requiring \"special management\" who has an *entire floor of the house* for her to relax, I'm thinking husband is never going to say yes and good for him. The situation is ridiculous (I can't imagine how much worse it was with another dog and four more chickens!).", "It's good you would look for a lower maintenance dog but I have to say your outlook on him choosing you with those animals and who you are etc. as a \"he knew what he was getting into\" Is a very unhealthy stubborn way to live in a relationship. An example, fitness is a huge part of my life. I run, train and lift religiously everyday. It's a large time commitment - I also have my full time job that is very important to me. My nutrition is relatively specific as is my sleep pattern and my job is demanding. My husband knew this about me and \"chose\" me knowing how important maintaining my fitness and career was to me. However, I'm not so stubborn I disregard anything he says about it or his feelings on the matter. I flex my fitness hours around what works for us as a couple and sacrifice at times my workouts/sleep/nutrition needs for something he may want to do as a couple. Work is not so easy to manipulate - so what has to be sacrificed is my workout passion. I don't throw at him \"well you chose me knowing  this is who I am\" which is basically a big fuck you I don't care what you say. Sure your man did choose you knowing this, but maybe he also thought you would be more reasonable as well since your lives have changed with the addition of kids and responsibilities. I would highly recommend learning to compromise. Get through the rest of the time with your senior dog,  compromise on a break time and then get a lower maintenance dog using all of the reasoning you mentioned above. You have to compromise.", "Did you have kids then? Because having children     can change everything. My husband and I had a cat. That cat was everything to us. But then we had kids. I still loved the cat but once he died we waited until the kids were older before we got 2 cats and a dog. I can see his reasoning for not wanting the extra responsibility and cost at this time.", "That's all a good point but now there are kids in the mix too, that may have put him over the edge.", "I'm sorry you can\u2019t do the Noah's ark thing because it sounds like you're an animal enthusiast.\n\nJust wait. Wait until your dear old girl has been gone for a while and see if he misses having the companionship of a dog. \n\nOne dog. He may be able to manage one dog.", "You sound incredibly self centered. Is what you want all that matters?", "I've never understood the need to have lots and lots of animals.\n\nMy mother in law had 8 cats, and 3 dogs. There was no way she spent quality time with any of the animals. Some days only spending the time to give them food and clean up their litter boxes.\n\nYou have a dog and rabbit already. Maybe your husband is tired of the menagerie. Especially since you have two young children. What's the rush, wait when your current dog has passed away.", "Perhaps let a friend or family member already with one adopt it then, seems cruel to keep it on its own.", "So you still got one despite knowing that they shouldn't be held alone just so you get what you want?", "It doesn't sound like this elderly dog is dying for a house mate. I had this experience when my old boy passed away last year, but that doesn't sound like OPs case.", "Ok, but he didn't say never. Only for now.", "I don\u2019t need to convince a stranger on the internet lol I have an entire community of real people I know, work with, and trust who have watched me raise my dogs and overcome numerous challenges with them. People who know me in real life come to me with questions about their pets, trust me above others to watch them in an emergency, and know the devotion I have to them. No comment here or anywhere else will sway what I know to be true.", "He never said he was going to agree to every animal she wants.  She said she wants another, and he isn\u2019t ready.  Her desire to bring one in does not inherently dismiss his desire to not have one, no matter how connected her mental health is tied to a canine.", "Ok, he understands how she feels, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has to agree to another dog.  She identifies as a dog person, as if it a gender.  It is absolutely clear she is the one moving the goalposts with all the animals.  If he wanted a zoo he would have bought one.\n\nShe needs to chill and enjoy the pets she has.  He will come around.", "Did I miss something? He had to clean up a little bit when the dog was sick and dying, because of unexpected accidents. I had the impression it was only rarely and only when somehow OP couldn't get to it, but I guess that's an assumption. A little bit of dog maintenance is hardly a burden. I see that people strongly disagree with me, but I think its crazy that he married a woman who flat out stated she always would need dogs in her life and now he is like, \"Eh, I'm thinking no on the dogs.\" Unless OP is really misconstruing something...", "This comment is void of the whole picture though. I have taken his feelings into consideration many times over the last 10 years regarding animals. I didn\u2019t get any more reptiles. I waited 8 years to get another rabbit. I\u2019ve resisted getting other small animals I\u2019d love to have that I always pictured myself having. I\u2019d love to have an actual farm but don\u2019t, and soon I won\u2019t even have chickens anymore. He has said no to almost every request I\u2019ve had regarding pets since we\u2019ve been married.", "Yes I just commented this. The kids are still young and even a smaller breed can be very overwhelming and you wiuld have to constantly watch the dogs, the kids. My SIL had several dogs already with both her kids young and she got a jack Russell, a small one, and she had to isolate him totally from the kid. Great enough that she was living in the countryside and that she could accommodate a former stalle. That\u2019s a big decision and that should really be thoroughly thought through. A good compromise would be to wait 2 years. It\u2019s not like there is no other pet in the house anyway. OP sounds really one-sided", "I\u2019ve never seen another rabbit in my life have as much attention, love and freedom as our bunny. He may be without a rabbit companion but we make sure he doesn\u2019t feel the loss. He has an outdoor pen so he can come out and play with us, a leash and basket so he can come on walks with us in the stroller, and the entire house to run around and play in. I don\u2019t know anyone else that doesn\u2019t keep a rabbit in a cage. His life isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s definitely not bad and I hope to get another rabbit in the future.", "I always think bunny rabbits should be running free in the outdoors, not in someone's house. It's such an unnatural environment for them but then I don't like the idea of any animal being trapped indoors or kept in an unnatural environment to what they should be able to have.", "No lol rabbits should not be bonded until after they have been neutered and hormones given a chance to settle down. I got this rabbit from a meat breeder who was about to send him to the freezer, and had an application in on an already spayed female at the shelter. Brought the boy home and got him neutered right away, and then my husband changed his mind about allowing the 2nd one.", "Yeah that sentiment makes no sense considering you\u2019re literally asking strangers of the internet in the first place, but when someone disagrees with you, you say you don\u2019t need strangers on the internet. Sounds like cope to being told shit you don\u2019t want to hear. \ud83e\udd23", "Well then why post this at all?", "My question was more around you saying that her having a heart dog puts her in the wrong in your original comment. That makes no sense to me. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how she\u2019s moving goalposts when she\u2019s apparently always been this way since they first met? It sounds like they\u2019ve had a multi-pet household since they\u2019ve been together, so if anyone has changed, it\u2019s the husband. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s ok for him to change what he wants, but she\u2019s the bad guy for being the same as she was when they met?", "What about your children though? They are very young and you said yourself your dogs were old dog, but bringing a new dog even a smaller breed and constantly look at whether the dog and/or the kids do not upset each other is very tiring. Plus a young dog around an older dog. I mean I\u2019m a pet lover (always had dogs) but I would not add a new dog without a thorough conversation with your hubby and see if that fits your family at that time. Maybe giving 2 year could be acceptable plus your kid would be less young.", "He needs to learn to compromise too then if that's all true. Like I don't like dogs, but I would compromise with my husband on another dog, if it's a different breed that I can pick, after a solid break and a full house deep clean - ugh husky hair. So yes your husband needs to compromise as well. I still think though get through your time with the senior dog before introducing a younger animal. Use this time to workout a solid compromise. Not an all or nothing type deal. Seems you would prefer the all, he wants the nothing, I do think it's possible to find a ground where you can be a single, low maintenanced dog household with kids.", "I didn\u2019t ask in my question how people feel about my senior dog or how they think I\u2019m caring for her. These comments concerning her are scraping at very little information, take nothing into consideration regarding her as an individual dog, her personality, or what her life as been like. They are all assumptions, and incorrect at that.", "What I posted was in regards to a new dog, not my senior dog as these comments are focused on. If I want opinions on my senior dog I\u2019ll make a new post about her.", "Loving animals and what she is describing are two very different things.  They have kids and this sounds like she has high expectations for a household that may not be able to accommodate them.  5 chickens?  Bunny? Dogs?  Yeah, he might be right that they need to take a bit of a chill, especially with an aging dog to manage.  Maybe he has changed when he realized how she views a \u201cheart\u201d dog as essential to her existence.  \n\nShe can desire one all she wants, but he gets a say on when he is ready to take on that responsibility.  She seems to struggle with that arrangement, thus she is the AH.", "Why come to reddit then and ask if you are the AH, then get upset when people tell you that you are being an AH. And rightly so.\n\nDon't ask questions to answers you may not like. And stop using the internet to fishing for approvals to your biases", "The poster you replied to WAS talking about your new dog situation. Certainly the amount and type of pets you already have is relevant- at least to your husband. You responded with a post saying nothing anyone on the internet says will change anything, followed by a long explanation of your dog expertise (maybe not husband expertise). I replied that if you don\u2019t care what we think why are you here asking us- so?", "Oh I\u2019m ok with people saying I\u2019m the AH lol I haven\u2019t fought anyone on that. I\u2019m not ok with people making assumptions about my senior dog."]}
