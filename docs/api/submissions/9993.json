In other words, they definitely did not need my shares of the will.\n\nThank you for your astute advice in recommending therapy to me.

You chose this, rather than to further enrich some already wealthy and toxic people. It was brave, but your bravery ensures that your mother will leave behind much more good in this world than she'd been able to without you taking this decisive and selfless action.

Would just love to see them squander their 1/4th inheritance in legal fees trying to get yours.

Your mom for suggesting you donate your share, you for not keeping it for your own loved ones (ie. kids or spouse or w/e) and your brothers for greed."]}
