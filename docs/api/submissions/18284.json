A year ago we were in a car accident- Paul was driving and 100% at fault. Paul had no injuries, but I broke my back. I was in a back brace for months and am still going to PT. After I was out of the brace I started going to the gym and running, and at this point I\u2019m in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been in. I\u2019m really proud of the progress I\u2019ve made. \n\nA month ago I found out that there was a 10k race on the 1 year anniversary of the accident in a mountain town about 3 hours away. I thought this would be a fun and positive way to spend the day and celebrate my recovery. I suggested this idea to Paul, my 2 best friends, and their partners- the plan was to drive there Friday afternoon, run the 10k Saturday morning, and spend the rest of the weekend exploring the town. Everyone was on board. \n\nPaul recently started a new job. It\u2019s fully remote and he hasn\u2019t met his coworkers yet. He is supposed to fly to SF to meet his team the Monday after our weekend trip- we knew this when we made our plans. \n\nA few days before our trip, Paul told me his bosses now want him to be in SF on Sunday because they got box seats to a Giants game and they want him to come, so he would no longer be able to come on our trip. I thought he was joking, because he makes fun of \u201ccorporate kiss-ass culture\u201d, but he was serious. I told him to explain the situation and that they can\u2019t expect him to be available with less than a week\u2019s notice. He said he had already told them yes and he didn\u2019t want to backtrack. So I asked him to tell them he forgot he had a wedding to attend or something like that, and he said he didn\u2019t want to turn down the offer because it would be a \u201creally good networking opportunity\u201d. \n\nI suggested he join on Friday as planned and drive back late Saturday or early Sunday to catch his flight. He said no because he didn\u2019t want to drive 6 hours round trip just for one day. I suggested he fly out of the regional airport nearby, which he also shot down because it would be too expensive (he makes good money so this wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden). I was almost in tears at this point, pleading him to come and telling him how important it was to me. When I realized he wasn\u2019t going to budge, I stopped trying to convince him, but I did let him know I was hurt and angered by his decision. \n\nThe morning I was supposed to leave, Paul was trying to be affectionate and sweet towards me, but I\u2019m still pretty upset, so I was admittedly pretty bitchy to him and rejected all attempts at affection. Now he\u2019s upset with me for \u201cruining\u201d our last day together and also for pressuring him to skip his work event. I think he\u2019s an asshole for prioritizing a baseball game over a celebration of my recovery, especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place.

He decided to prioritise a work social event over you without consulting you first even though it had major impact on you.  He may have felt pressurised on phone. But you offered a lot of alternatives and he knocked them all back. And then you are expected to put your hurt aside so he can feel good about himself. He made decisions and they had consequences. One consequence was an upset wife. He can deal with that.", "Nta . Obviously", "NTA on the initial part, but then you said \"especially considering he's the one that caused my injury in the 1st place\" - that sounds really, really nasty. \n\nGuilt tripping him for the rest of your life with him won't be good emotionally. \n\nIs the whole celebration of your progress a moment to rub his nose in the fact \"he caused it\"?\n\nGood luck.", "NTA- I think the biggest thing here is that Paul should have communicated with you BEFORE telling his employers he agreed to attend the Giants game. He knew that you all had a trip planned, knew it was important to you, and knew full well that he would have to cancel, but he chose to accept his works invitation without consulting with you first. \nWhile I understand the importance of networking, especially at a new job, he should have at least had the courtesy to discuss it with you.

He sucks. \n  \n  He also drove so poorly/ irresponsibly that you broke your back\u2026 never mind resenting him, I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t exploded.

Since he knows the significance of this date, agreed to come, then just decided your needs are not important and changed the plan without your input, no. NTA.  He is also an AH for trying to love bomb you to get back on your good side.  The whole, if I can make her not be mad, that means I wasn't a jerk thing is very immature on his part.\n\nYWBTA if you don't re-examine past interactions with him to see if he is always this selfish but you were just explaining it away with a story that made him look better than he is.\n\nCongratulations on all the work you did, and also all the work you are doing without him!!!", "OP, you are a much bigger and nicer person than I am. Not once did you remind him that the trip was to celebrate your progress in recovery after he broke your back. I would have. \n\nHaving said that, he was provided a couple of alternatives that were more than reasonable. And why is HE paying for a flight/travel for business? \n\nNTA. \n\nBut, he has shown you where you rank in his priorities. I would imagine if you look back in your relationship you\u2019ll find you\u2019ve taken the backseat more than not.", "NTA. Paul is the one that \"ruined\" the day, not you.\n\nHe was at fault for an incident that could have killed or paralysed you. Thankfully, you're making great progress.\n\nIt's completely understandable why this event would mean so much to you.\n\nPaul shouldn't have agreed to go the day earlier without talking to you first. Instead, he immediately told them he'd be there. He didn't prioritise you at all and is blaming you for the fallout.", "NTA - this is an incredibly important event for you, and he isn't willing to event mildly inconvenience himself.  I get it's an important work event, but he could attend your run.  He doesn't want to have to make the effort.  After the year you have had, that's really shit.  I am sorry OP.\n\nETA - I read the driving as being 6 hours each way.  It's 6 hrs round trip.  Sorry, but that's even worse.  he could EASILY drive back on the Saturday afternoon, have a chilled evening on Saturday relaxing and get his flight.  That's 3 hrs driving EACH DAY.  Plenty of people do more than that on their daily commute.  This is BS of the the highest level. OP ignore all the people here saying \"oh but he's going to be sooooo stressed poor dear driving 3 hours is soooooooo hard he can't possibly be expected to cope with that\"", "NTA. He could have easily flown out of the regional airport. This was to celebrate your recovery from something that he caused.  A good partner learns how to juggle these things. What if it was the same day of a kids high school graduation?  A funeral of a loved one? You learn to work these things out. This is coming from someone married for 42 years.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s the US, and not Korea for example where network events are basically a must. \n\nHe made a commitment to go with you and bailed on it for a work opportunity that could show up later on. That\u2019s a special date, if his employer can\u2019t understand that, is it a workplace he wants to work in ?\n\nAlso she offered so many alternatives and he just couldn\u2019t be bothered. \nThe sight trouble that would cause him to was valued higher than his partner feelings. \n\nI get that it\u2019s your inner monologue, but it\u2019s good that you\u2019re working on your resentment. You shouldn\u2019t late it tarnish your relationship or you\u2019ll never be able to move on. \nBut honestly on his side tho, if that were me just the guilt would have made me stick to that plan. \nIf I knew I had caused something like that, and my partner was healing from it, I\u2019d celebrate it with them. \n\nThis is really something I don\u2019t understand where people are like \u201cwell it wasn\u2019t my intention so people should just move on\u201d. People are so individualistic that makes me so angry.", "Opinions seem to be pretty evenly divided. I do want to clarify a couple things- I never tried to get Paul to come by saying or implying the injury was his fault. Yes, I was thinking it, but I\u2019ve never used that against him. There are obviously resentment issues which is something I\u2019m working through, but I would never say that to his face. \n\nA lot of people are saying iata because I was pressuring him to skip his work event. When I realized how important it was to him, I tried to compromise with him to be able to make both events happen. It was his refusal to compromise that was upsetting.", "NTA. First of all, I'm glad you've made such s fast and triumphant recovery after what has probably been a really emotional year for you. He committed first to be there for you on this weekend, and now wants to shake it up for box tickets? Absolutely not.", "NTA. It's fine that he wants to present well for work, but the fact that he isn't interested in compromising after ditching your plans without talking to you makes him a major AH. He seems to want you to make him feel good about his decision by giving him affection before he heads out, and ignoring your own feelings and hurt. You didn't ruin anything. I hope you have a great weekend celebrating your recovery.", "NTA. He blew off important plans for an optional work event. You even suggested an alternative that would have allowed him to attend both events, but he couldn't even do that.  And it's not at all unusual or unprofessional for people to inform new employers of preexisting travel plans. Jesus, there are a lot of bootlickers here.", "NTA he chose to put his work and his wants above you. Above an event already agreed upon. Could have been a great moment for him to build you up and share about the amazing partner he\u2019s with. Most people would have appreciated it and shown he sticks to commitments. Instead he\u2019s been a total ah about the whole thing.", "NTA. First anniversaries of traumatic events are really hard. I was in a head on collision and was mentally doing really well until about a month before the first anniversary, and it completely caught me off guard how hard it was going to be. I went from feeling amazing to suicidal and engaging in self harm for the first time ever in my life, genuinely believing the surgeons had made a mistake saving my life. It\u2019s a really difficult time and I\u2019m sure your emotions are all over the place right now. Sending love \u2764\ufe0f", "INFO:  how was he 100% at fault in the accident?  Seems like you\u2019re holding on to a lot of resentment for this.  Was he driving drunk/high?  Did he deliberately drive off a cliff?  I\u2019m trying to imagine a scenario where one driver is completely at fault.  Can you please elaborate?", "NTA. You gave a lot of reasonable alternatives to make both events work out for him.", "NTA. He should have flown out of the Regional Airport. Nothing about this was Mission Impossible. You often have competing responsibilities, he needs to work the plan. You don't appear to rise to level of importance where he considered your needs.", "YTA. His event is work and can shape his reputation and perception at a new job. You\u2019re trying to phrase it as choosing a baseball game over a celebration of your recovery but I see it as you asking him to choose a race over work. \n\nYou discussed \u201ccorporate kiss-ass culture\u201d in your post before so you understand exactly what is expected of Paul and how it could change his life. You spoke of Paul making good money, that implies he has a good job. If you enjoy the benefits of Paul working a good corporate job, you have to deal with the drawbacks as well.", "I understand your point, but if I was him, I would also be networking. Networking culture may suck but if you want to advance in your career, you kind if have to join in, especially in the beginning. \n\nYou're using guilt to get what you want. You mentioned it twice, in one post, that it was 100% his fault that you broke ur back. I can't even imagine how many times he has to hear it. And a whole weekend to celebrate you, in a town 3 hours away? The guilt is working I guess.\n\nYtA.  You can move your celebration, he can't move his event.", "If you\u2019re holding a car accident against him 1 year later, YTA. You had a choice to leave, but you chose to stay. That\u2019s manipulative af. Full stop. \n\nAlso, what he says about corporate culture doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t do what is expected of him at his job. Especially a new job. I understand your trip is important to you, but staying gainfully employee sounds equally important to Paul. Giving him the cold shoulder, playing childish games and ruining the last moments you had together solved what exactly?!", "YTA\n\nSlightly, I don't think it's right you're still punishing him for the car accident a year ago, that's something you need to address so it doesn't fester, because every-time you fight or he does something you don't like you can't whip that out to make him feel like shit.\n\nWhile I understand this is important to you, emotionally manipulating by crying and pleading isn't the way to be in a relationship, has Paul been a great support and partner over the past year? I don't think you should punish him for not being there on one day you run this marathon, work events are important to and he think this will be a great opportunity for him to network, just because you don't think it's important doesn't mean that it isn't for him.\n\nBut yeah the \"especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place\" comment needs to be addressed, that's not a great sign for the relationship if you're still blaming him one year later.", "YTA. Starting a new job is a big deal and you\u2019re asking him to establish, at the very start, that he doesn\u2019t take his job seriously. That\u2019s the message his not going sends. It will have long term consequences. His not going away for the weekend only has consequences for you and you. Congratulations on your recovery\u2014hopefully there will be many more opportunities to celebrate in the future in a way that doesn\u2019t place your ego over his career.", "I was going to say N-T-A because you offered a lot of reasonable compromises to him juggling both the work event and your anniversary run.\n\nBut your belittling of his work event and guilt tripping about the accident leads me to YTA. \n\nThe work event is important because as much as he might not like \u201ckiss ass corporate culture\u201d it can genuinely affect your long term career and given it\u2019s a new job he\u2019s not in an easy position to excuse himself without giving the wrong impression. I understand your disappointment, but you\u2019re not at all acknowledging the significance of something important and potentially necessary in his life.\n\nAlso, you can\u2019t hold the accident over his head forever. Well, you can, but if that\u2019s how you feel you can\u2019t stay with him and use it against him. If he\u2019s apologized properly and supported you through your recovery then he\u2019s doing the right things for you and your relationship and to make amends. I\u2019d also ask you to have some empathy for the fact that the anniversary may be difficult for him if he feels guilty.", "NAH. Although it sucks that he can\u2019t come to the race, and your progress is incredible and I\u2019m so happy for you, you can\u2019t back out of work plans at a new job. You can go together to the next one. Side note, to say he caused your injury in the first place is kind of a low blow. Accidents happen. Plans change. Such is life.", "YTA - it's a new job.  He needs to do some networking, particularly since he works remote.  It's not just a \"baseball game\" as you say and not just a social event.  You're out of your mind and need to let go of the clear resentment you have for the car accident.", "I think it is fantastic that you've recovered from your injury to the point you can do a 10K run on the first anniversary of the car accident. But I am confused by the repeated use of \"accident\" to refer to what happened when you are putting the blame on Paul. \n\nAnd just because he agreed to attend doesn't mean that he wanted to 'celebrate' the first anniversary of the day you were so seriously injured, which you clearly still blame him for. Just because you refer to it as a fun and positive way to celebrate your recovery does not mean he was looking at the day with the same mindset. \n\n>So I asked him to tell them he forgot he had a wedding to attend or something like that, and he said he didn\u2019t want to turn down the offer because it would be a \u201creally good networking opportunity\u201d.\n\nIn other words, you asked Paul to lie to his bosses in a way which could easily - either by posts on SM or a slip of the tongue comment - get back to them as a lie. You asked Paul to tell them that he'd forgotten something important, which doesn't show responsibility. And you asked Paul to pull out of the first networking opportunity, and the first opportunity to get to know his colleagues/bosses in a non-work environment.\n\nIt isn't clear from your post whether Paul had forgotten about the conflict when he was invited to the game, or whether he reluctantly accepted because he felt pressured into accepting (or indeed whether he was eager to jump at an excuse not to attend the celebratory run). I wonder did you even ask him?\n\nAnd as for your comment about him shooting down the cost of flying from the regional airport... Even if you have full knowledge of Paul's savings, the past year has probably made him well aware of one event could seriously impact his ability to work, and well as the impact of medical bills. But I've got to wonder, are you certain you are clear on the stability of Paul's finances? Or are you making assumptions here because his current income?\n\n>Now he\u2019s upset with me for \u201cruining\u201d our last day together and also for pressuring him to skip his work event. I think he\u2019s an asshole for prioritizing a baseball game over a celebration of my recovery, especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place. \n\nI can understand why you are both upset, but do you really believe he is prioritising the game, as opposed to prioritising his career?  \n\nAnd I do hope you didn't say last bit to him, otherwise it could well have been your last day together. \n\nI want to say N-A-H, here but frankly your lack of understanding is leading me to YTA.", ">considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place.\n\ni knew this was coming as soon as i read that he was driving in the accident, YTA either break up or get rid of your resentment before this becomes an abusive relationship", "YTA This is very unfortunate but it doesn\u2019t sound like he really has a choice. This is the first time he gets to see all of his colleagues and his bosses explicitly asked him to attend. It would like really really bad if he canceled. I get that you\u2019re excited about the run and it means a lot to you, but it\u2019s too big of an ask to cancel his first work obligation. I wouldn\u2019t drive for six hours for a one day visit before catching a flight either. That\u2019s disproportionate in my opinion.", "YTA. He's starting a new job and you want to stress him out by forcing him to go to this run despite any nervousness about the new job.\n\nBlaming him for the accident while simultaneously wanting to celebrate its anniversary isn't a good look. This isn't the sort of thing you celebrate.\n\nThe time to celebrate your recovery is a year from your recovery, not the accident anniversary so you can continue to guilt trip him.", "YTA for talking about how he caused your accident, over and over. \n\nIt was an \u201caccident\u201d not on purpose. If you had a car accident, would you be ok if someone you loved kept bringing up that it\u2019s \u201ctheir fault\u201d. How long are you planning on playing that card? \n\nNew work networking opportunity is fair reason to miss watching you run a 10k race. He would be driving on the road 6 hours in one day right before he leaves for his work trip. That was a bad idea anyway. \n\nBe happy you are able to recover and stop thinking that he owes you in a bigger way for driving the car that caused the accident.", "YTA for the emotional manipulation. You guilt tripping about the accident is 100x worse than him missing your race.", "YTA\n\nI am very sorry for the accident you were in and for the long, difficult recovery you endured. I also feel that you had a choice: the accident was Paul's \"fault\" so you either got to end the relationship and leave him, or you accepted this fact, forgave him and moved forward. Being bitter and holding it over him for the rest of your lives is not going to work. So if you can't let this point go, that it was an accident, no matter whose \"fault\" it was, and he doesn't \"owe\" you anything, you need to just end the relationship.\n\nAs for your celebration of recovery trip versus the business trip he's being both required and pressured to go on for his new job, I think he's between a rock and a hard place.\n\n>***I think he\u2019s an asshole*** *for prioritizing a baseball game over a celebration of my recovery,* ***especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place.*** *My friends are on my side but I\u2019d like some unbiased perspective.*\n\nI also think that if you've ever voiced the same \"the accident was his fault\" sentiment to him, or any of your friends or family members in the past year, he may not be as keen on coming on this trip, where you may subtly remind him, or he may be subtly reminded how you really feel on the subject. **The work trip may be providing the perfect excuse to get out of the recurring guilt trip.**", "YTA- yes, it seems to me he practically leapt at the chance to get out of that \"let's commemorate the accident\" trip you planned. To you it celebrates your progress, to him it may be a reminder of something he feels guilty about. He didn't do it on purpose, but you sure were quick to point out he's \"100% at fault.\" I can't really fault him for not participating in in order to build his new job connections, though, instead of a weekend focusing on what had to be one of the worst days of his life. I hope you both are/have been going to therapy to work out any unresolved anger/guilt that would be an understandable reaction to such a major trauma.", "YTA. \nThe \"alternatives\" you're offering aren't good alternatives. Driving that much for a single day before a huge work trip isn't feasible or safe.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A year ago we were in a car accident- Paul was driving and 100% at fault. Paul had no injuries, but I broke my back. I was in a back brace for months and am still going to PT. After I was out of the brace I started going to the gym and running, and at this point I\u2019m in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been in. I\u2019m really proud of the progress I\u2019ve made. \n\nA month ago I found out that there was a 10k race on the 1 year anniversary of the accident in a mountain town about 3 hours away. I thought this would be a fun and positive way to spend the day and celebrate my recovery. I suggested this idea to Paul, my 2 best friends, and their partners- the plan was to drive there Friday afternoon, run the 10k Saturday morning, and spend the rest of the weekend exploring the town. Everyone was on board. \n\nPaul recently started a new job. It\u2019s fully remote and he hasn\u2019t met his coworkers yet. He is supposed to fly to SF to meet his team the Monday after our weekend trip- we knew this when we made our plans. \n\nA few days before our trip, Paul told me his bosses now want him to be in SF on Sunday because they got box seats to a Giants game and they want him to come, so he would no longer be able to come on our trip. I thought he was joking, because he makes fun of \u201ccorporate kiss-ass culture\u201d, but he was serious. I told him to explain the situation and that they can\u2019t expect him to be available with less than a week\u2019s notice. He said he had already told them yes and he didn\u2019t want to backtrack.

He said no because he didn\u2019t want to drive 6 hours round trip just for one day.

When I realized he wasn\u2019t going to budge, I stopped trying to convince him, but I did let him know I was hurt and angered by his decision. \n\nThe morning I was supposed to leave, Paul was trying to be affectionate and sweet towards me, but I\u2019m still pretty upset, so I was admittedly pretty bitchy to him and rejected all attempts at affection.

Or at least do some sort of celebratory experience/activity together that week when you\u2019re back together?\n\nI know a woman who survived a horrific car accident many years ago now, and every year on the anniversary she holds a huge party to celebrate still being here. \n\nHim not being with you for the race must be upsetting, but I hope you absolutely smash it! YOU have done the hard work building up to this. Don\u2019t let this ruin it for you. \u2764\ufe0f", "Bottom line for me is that he had already made a commitment to you and he broke it for a better offer. He's TA. \n\nAlthough I do agree that adding the part about the accident being his fault was below the belt. It really doesn't have anything to do with the present situation. Please don't use that as a cudgel against him for the rest of your relationship.", "I would look at this in the context of how much is Paul generally present and engaged in your life and events? Forget about who caused the accident. Did Paul 100% help and support you with your long and painful recovery? Is he a partner that prioritizes you and your time together over his own pursuits? Does he often plan and initiate the things you do together and is an enthusiastic participant? If yes, then he does have a right to make this one-off event his priority (his job will carry on into the future and his event can help him advance; your recovery is complete and you will be celebrating what is now hopefully a closed chapter in your life).\nIf he is always off to do his own thing and trying to avoid participating in what is important to you, then yes, you are right to be upset.", "Is it possible that he is feeling guilty and is trying to avoid the run as he knows the car accident will be brought up alot and even though it is celebrating your progress he is trying to avoid the situation as it will bring up the event over and over?", "NAH. The real problem here is that he said yes first to the change in the work trip without consulting you first, knowing that this was an important event for you. He has every right to further his career and I'm sure he saw this change as a necessity but he should have still consulted with you first before saying yes.", "I realize how that comes across, but I do want to say I never said or implied that to Paul, it was basically my inner monologue. I\u2019d be lying if I said there weren\u2019t any resentment issues from the car accident but it\u2019s something I\u2019m working through. The celebration is exactly that. It was a really shit year for me. I was unable to work for 6 months. I was in an unbelievable amount of pain. I wanted to celebrate how much progress I\u2019ve made, and that\u2019s always how I framed it to Paul- it was never an intent to guilt trip him.", "I mean it\u2019s rude, but it\u2019s true\u2026", "Will you still punish him when he gets back? How long will you hold onto this for? The biggest out of this for me is the comment about \"especially because he caused this injury\" now I know you said you have never said this to his face (thank god) but you think therefor the built up resentment is eating at you, and I'm not sure how you're working through that feeling but now you are upset at him for not coming to this important 10k run anniversary, so now this is another thing you will bottle up and resent him for, you see how this can start to pile up?", "That\u2019s because all the compromises are not reasonable. Have you ever had to drive 6 hours, catch a flight, and then have to work? Because trust me, attending a game as a company event is definitely work. You have to network and be careful what you say and build relationships with the team and it\u2019s very VERY hard to actually rest and have fun.  Looking in from the outside, it\u2019s easy to assume he will be going there to have fun, but companies don\u2019t spend money for their people with no reason. You should be supporting him in going to work, not encouraging him to lie to skip work, or pressure him to burn himself out before getting to work. Because if you only see it as him going off to have fun, you\u2019re having a wrong view of corporate events", "He was charged with a misdemeanor for the crash. He was looking at his phone and drove off the road. It wasn\u2019t a cliff but it was a very steep hill. So no, he didn\u2019t do it deliberately, which is why I used the term accident, but yes, he was 100% at fault.", "Which is why I tried to compromise with him to make both events happen. It was his refusal to compromise that upset me.", "And even if you make good money, overpaying on a flight is still a waste of money!", "I mentioned this in another comment, but I want to clarify I never said that to Paul. There are resentment issues which is something I\u2019m working through but I\u2019ve never said anything like that to him.\n\nI understand networking culture is important, which is why I gave him a couple alternatives to make both events happen. And no, my event can\u2019t be moved because it was the 1 year anniversary and the 10k was only taking place that day.", "This.   YTA.", "Paul's behavior on the last day was a manipulation.  She saw right through it.    If he wants this to resolve he needs to own that he screwed up with her, and apologize.  Then she will know by the tone of his voice, and body language if he is sincere or not.  Then they can move forward.  \n\n\"Ruining the last moments\" let him know that he can't make it better by a couple of hugs and a little sweettalk, so the 'what it solved' is letting him know that she is still hurt that he just threw her aside when he found something that would benefit him.  It is part of standing up for herself and saying this is not acceptable.  Better would be to straight up tell him I am still hurt by your disregard for me and I really can't be around you today, and much much worse would be pretending everything between them is sunshine and roses. \n\nLet him spend the weekend thinking about who he wants to be, and how to do better next time.", "That\u2019s fair enough regarding your first point. However, I will point out that I gave him a couple alternatives to make both events happen, and it was his refusal to compromise that upset me the most, especially considering this trip had been planned and booked in advance, and it was pretty shitty for me to suddenly be the 5th wheel.", "How the fuck is her crying manipulative? It's clearly a fucking emotional thing espically she has finally recovered. Anyone would be emotional", "As I mentioned, I gave a couple alternatives to make both events happen. He could have made both work if he wanted to.", "His carelessness caused a car crash. As per OP he was charged for it. With this info, it's not an accident, it's someone behaving like an idiot behind the wheel.", "Maybe I should have used the word crash instead. Paul was charged with a misdemeanor for the \u201caccident\u201d. As to his finances, we\u2019ve been together for 4 years and live together. I\u2019ve seen his bank statements. We\u2019re both very comfortable financially and money is not a concern.", "Without going into too many details, he was charged with a misdemeanor for the \u201caccident\u201d. Maybe crash would have been a better word choice because accident implies there was no one at fault.", "Even if you don't say this out loud to Paul, harboring a resentment like this and using it as 'he owes me cos he caused this accident therefore he will go where I point' is going to bleed out in ways you don't really have to express outright.\n\nTo be honest, I stopped a bit at 100% Paul's fault and then stopped completely midway through the post because it does not seem completely relevant to your post. Personally for me, if this is something that I am unable to move past, then this relationship isn't going to last. Cos he's gonna spend the rest of his days trying to make it up to you and you're going to continue to harbor this resentment.", "Right or wrong, resentment is obvious as are guilt trips.", "But you did guilt trip him? Crying and pleading for him to come is massively guilt tripping, making him feel like a piece of sh\\*t for trying to improve his work life.\n\nIf he has been a great BF and support partner over the past year, I think it's unfair to punish him for one day of not being able to celebrate this occasion with you, it's symbolic yes but it doesn't mean he puts you last.", "He didn't have to work, they invited him to a sports game. He abandoned his wife for a sports game. Let's not pretend he's going to perform life saving surgery. He's going to knock back beers with the boys.", "Question, has he let you down this past year, has he supported you and been a fantastic BF during your recovery? Has he got a habit of always putting you second or is this the first time he has prioritised something over you that's really important to you? \n\nIf has been a great support partner over the past year, don't make him feel shitty over this.", "While I understand your perspective, the compromises were to either drive a 6 hour round trip in one day or buy an unnecessary plane ticket. Both are him solely baring the burden. That\u2019s not much of a compromise and if I was Paul, I wouldn\u2019t take those deals either.\n\nEdit: just saw that you told him to lie and say he forgot a wedding. \n\n1.\tThat makes him look like an irresponsible and forgetful person to his bosses.\n2.\tWhat if someone sees him at the race and it gets back to the bosses? Now he\u2019s a liar to his bosses.", "Compromise is about two people making concessions.  All the burden to make this work is on him....which is expected since you've spent the last year holding the accident over his head.  You've intentionally put him in a very difficult, very stressful situation just to punish him.  I wonder if he's only still with you out of guilt?  Damn....just let him go already.", "Your compromise was not realistic.  I think he should have let you know before he made the work commitment, but I don't think you're being realistic about his ability to not take part in this work event or successfully work around it to do both in the way you're suggesting.", "Another way of saying this is \u201csupporting his gf is a waste of money!\u201d", "Just reading through the alternatives were stressful. If something were to go wrong with the travel then what? I would have declined too. That's a lot right before you leave town.", "The first point is *not* fair in fact.  The poster is saying once you decided to stay in the relationship, immediately after the crash, the topic was over and done with and could never be mentioned again without you being \u201cmanipulative\u201d.  That\u2019s just idiotic and nonsensical, not to mention smacks of misogyny.\n\nThe crash was technically irrelevant.  Your planned event could\u2019ve been a simple friend excursion without any great \u201creason\u201d to comemorate, and it would still be hurtful of him to back out like this.\n\n\nFailing to end the relationship when the accident happens doesn\u2019t mean", "Driving 3 hours on a Friday afternoon, staying the night, then driving 3 hours back less than 24 hours later is ridiculous, so I get why no-one wants to do that before an important work networking trip. The option to fly out was the best, but he couldn't possibly fly out early Sunday if he needs to be there on Sunday, he probably wants to get there with plenty of time and not be stressed. Just as your weekend is important to you, this trip is also very important to him.\n\nHe was going on this anniversary trip with you, but a last minute thing came up he was invited to and he probably thought it was a great way to socially bond with his co-workers in a little more fun/relaxed setting, those kind of things are gold when you haven't met anyone yet, more important that a lot of people think.", "Both alternatives made for a stressful start to his work trip though. He is probably really nervous/anxious for this trip, and wants it go well, the driving up then back in less than 24 hours isn't ideal. The flying out of the regional airport would have to be done on the saturday at some point, he probably doesn't want to fly on the early sunday morning because he wants to be there a little early to get his bearings.", "The alternatives aren\u2019t practical.", "The alternatives would\u2019ve been increasingly taxing and difficult for him to make it to his work event safely. \n\nWhile this was a \u2018fun\u2019 work event, as a new employee, and one who works remotely, these events are pretty much absolutely essential. Skipping out on it can make him seem like not a team player, which can cost him his job, which would affect both of you. \n\nWhile it sucks that he can\u2019t be there for your anniversary, pressuring him so much witth unreasonable alternatives is not very understanding of you. Please be more understanding that he sometimes needs to prioritize work, especially if it\u2019s a new job, and particularly if he\u2019s working remotely. It\u2019s very easy for bosses to think he\u2019s not working hard if they can\u2019t see him.", "I think we need the too many details", "Crying is a normal response to an emotional situation.   It's disgusting how many misogynistic men equate that to guilt trips or manipulation.   Women cry when they're sad.   Accept it.  \nIf her tears make him feel guilty,  he likely had something to feel guilty about.", "Disagree completely. OP did not guilt trip him. She was emotional, but that doesn't equal guilt tripping.\n\nOP gave him valid options so he could have attended both events. Instead, he chose to ditch her the second an opportunity came his way.\n\nAn opportunity with less than a weeks notice on the same day he already had what should be a very important event scheduled.\n\nBut yeah I get it, its his career and super important for networking. Which he didn't hesitate to throw at OP when she questioned him.\n\nOf course, that's totally not guilt tripping OP or anything though.", "An unnecessary plane ticket, if he can indeed afford it like OP claims, seems like a pretty small \u201cburden\u201d to do something that is extremely important to your SO, that he agreed to and helped plan, so it\u2019s not like he was being forced into in the first place. I just don\u2019t get why he doesn\u2019t care enough to try and be there for OP.", "Why on earth should she have to share the burden? He's the one bailing last minute on an important event that has been planned for a month without being willing to do the slightest bit of compromise that inconveniences him.  She's not the one who has changed anything.  he obviously DGAF", "Those compromises are hardly a \u201cburden\u201d. They are an inconvenience, and he is showing that it\u2019s inconvenient for him to show support.", "That\u2019s not what the poster said, read again. Nobody says she\u2019s not allowed to mention it. Yet, if you keep feeling resentment, it inevitably will hurt your relationship. It indeed wouldn\u2019t be fair to use it as a bargaining chip (not saying that OP did). Also, what the hell does misogyny to do with this? (Yes, before you ask, I\u2019m a woman). \n\nI don\u2019t think he has a choice but to back out, considering his bosses told him to be there and he\u2019s new to the job.", "It\u2019s amazing to me how people on this sub think driving is such a big deal. Three hours one day and three hours back the next day is not that much for something important!", "I completely disagree, people drive that distance all the time for a weekend ski trip or other events. Husband is being an ass by refusing that, AND refusing the time saving option to fly when there is no financial reason to do so.\n\nHusband is demonstrating, beyond any doubt, that her recovery is less important to him that his personal convenience.", "Wow people are babies about driving. I don\u2019t think making that drive is any big deal at all to support your SO in something really important to them. I do that every summer just to help out at a camp for a 12 hour shift. Many people spend nearly that much time commuting to and from work many times a week. You must be very selfish in your relationship if that kind of effort would be considered \u201cridiculous\u201d to do for your SO.", "Utter BS.  Paul has two incredibly important things on the same weekend.  If he is willing to cancel this trip for his partner to attend a work event, then he should be willing to put the same amount of effort into attending this run.  Fundamentally, Paul wants to attend the Giants game more than he wants to support his partner, and isn't willing to even mildly inconvenience himself.  That's AH behaviour. He COULD very easily attend the run - do a 6 hr round drive (unpleasant, but POSSIBLE), fly out from the regional airport the night before (expensive, but POSSIBLE), tell his boss he has other very important plans that weekend.  He just doens't want to even slightly inconvenience himself. \n\nOh and anyone holding OP's resentment against her - you try being incapable of moving, in pain, bedridden, out of work and having to go to PT to move properly again because your partner is a bad driver, and you see if you manage not stewing in resentment.  I agree she needs to deal with it, and it's unhealthy, but FFS she's human.", "They are perfectly practical, just inconvenient for him. He should be willing to bear a minor discomfort to show support for his wife.", "Too bad.  Man up.", "He was looking at his phone and drove the car off the road- no other vehicles involved.", "It always blows my mind when people say that men are so unemotional because it's not \"okay\" for them to cry as it is for women. But then when women do cry or get upset, we're guilt tripped for being unreasonable. \n\nWomen aren't \"allowed\" by society to be emotional, we just let ourselves feel our feelings because it's ridiculous not to.", "Pleading is a form of guilt tripping IMO. \n\nThose valid options were sh\\*t though, he is probably so nervous anxious about the work trip going well, that the options would have made him so stressed. All that driving in less than 24 hours, flying out on the Sunday morning? The day he is supposed to be with the team, very stressful IMO.", "OP says it wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden but doesn\u2019t question that it would be expensive. I guess the cost of the ticket could matter here. Big difference between hundreds and thousands.", "He has to WORK. He\u2019s not bailing because he wants to go to a baseball game, he\u2019s going because his boss made a last minute change to the plans on a business trip. OP is suggesting that he lie to his boss and say he\u2019s going to a wedding so he can instead be in a race with her. It\u2019s silly. \n\nPlans change, especially working in a corporate job.", "Right. I recently drove 3 hours each way, in the same day, with a toddler, to go clamming with my dad. It was fine. I can't imagine feeling like that was too much to do for a really important event with my partner.", "Tell me you don't understand shitty corporate culture without telling me.\n\nNot attending events like this, especially as a remote employee, puts you behind the ball for promotions and extra responsibilities while putting you near the head of the layoff line for \"not being a team player\".\n\nEveryone is saying this is a great job market, but shooting yourself in the foot like this has a good chance of sinking your career.", "Do you think those stressful options are more stressful, or less stressful than spending a year in recovery from a broken back?", "He doesn't have to work!! He was invited to a sporting event at the last minute!! He's going because it would be more fun than supporting his wife.", "Tell me you didn\u2019t read the full post without telling me.\n\nAgain: he can drive, or he can fly, and still attend both events.\n\nHe is choosing to skip his wife\u2019s event because he doesn\u2019t want to be inconvenienced. He is the asshole.", "Exactly!", ">I thought he was joking, because he makes fun of \u201ccorporate kiss-ass culture\u201d \n\nThis implied to me that OP understands the situation that Paul finds himself in. Lying about a wedding to avoid something, even a baseball game, that a boss invited you to is not a good career move. Attending a baseball game with the bosses and being seen as a \u201cteam guy\u201d is a good career move. I think even OP understands that."]}
