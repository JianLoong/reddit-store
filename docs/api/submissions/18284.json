A year ago we were in a car accident- Paul was driving and 100% at fault. Paul had no injuries, but I broke my back. I was in a back brace for months and am still going to PT. After I was out of the brace I started going to the gym and running, and at this point I\u2019m in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been in. I\u2019m really proud of the progress I\u2019ve made. \n\nA month ago I found out that there was a 10k race on the 1 year anniversary of the accident in a mountain town about 3 hours away. I thought this would be a fun and positive way to spend the day and celebrate my recovery. I suggested this idea to Paul, my 2 best friends, and their partners- the plan was to drive there Friday afternoon, run the 10k Saturday morning, and spend the rest of the weekend exploring the town. Everyone was on board. \n\nPaul recently started a new job. It\u2019s fully remote and he hasn\u2019t met his coworkers yet. He is supposed to fly to SF to meet his team the Monday after our weekend trip- we knew this when we made our plans. \n\nA few days before our trip, Paul told me his bosses now want him to be in SF on Sunday because they got box seats to a Giants game and they want him to come, so he would no longer be able to come on our trip. I thought he was joking, because he makes fun of \u201ccorporate kiss-ass culture\u201d, but he was serious. I told him to explain the situation and that they can\u2019t expect him to be available with less than a week\u2019s notice. He said he had already told them yes and he didn\u2019t want to backtrack. So I asked him to tell them he forgot he had a wedding to attend or something like that, and he said he didn\u2019t want to turn down the offer because it would be a \u201creally good networking opportunity\u201d. \n\nI suggested he join on Friday as planned and drive back late Saturday or early Sunday to catch his flight. He said no because he didn\u2019t want to drive 6 hours round trip just for one day. I suggested he fly out of the regional airport nearby, which he also shot down because it would be too expensive (he makes good money so this wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden). I was almost in tears at this point, pleading him to come and telling him how important it was to me. When I realized he wasn\u2019t going to budge, I stopped trying to convince him, but I did let him know I was hurt and angered by his decision. \n\nThe morning I was supposed to leave, Paul was trying to be affectionate and sweet towards me, but I\u2019m still pretty upset, so I was admittedly pretty bitchy to him and rejected all attempts at affection. Now he\u2019s upset with me for \u201cruining\u201d our last day together and also for pressuring him to skip his work event. I think he\u2019s an asshole for prioritizing a baseball game over a celebration of my recovery, especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place.

He decided to prioritise a work social event over you without consulting you first even though it had major impact on you.  He may have felt pressurised on phone. But you offered a lot of alternatives and he knocked them all back. And then you are expected to put your hurt aside so he can feel good about himself. He made decisions and they had consequences. One consequence was an upset wife. He can deal with that.", "Nta . Obviously", "NTA on the initial part, but then you said \"especially considering he's the one that caused my injury in the 1st place\" - that sounds really, really nasty. \n\nGuilt tripping him for the rest of your life with him won't be good emotionally. \n\nIs the whole celebration of your progress a moment to rub his nose in the fact \"he caused it\"?\n\nGood luck.", "NTA- I think the biggest thing here is that Paul should have communicated with you BEFORE telling his employers he agreed to attend the Giants game. He knew that you all had a trip planned, knew it was important to you, and knew full well that he would have to cancel, but he chose to accept his works invitation without consulting with you first. \nWhile I understand the importance of networking, especially at a new job, he should have at least had the courtesy to discuss it with you.

He sucks. \n  \n  He also drove so poorly/ irresponsibly that you broke your back\u2026 never mind resenting him, I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t exploded.

Since he knows the significance of this date, agreed to come, then just decided your needs are not important and changed the plan without your input, no. NTA.

The whole, if I can make her not be mad, that means I wasn't a jerk thing is very immature on his part.\n\nYWBTA if you don't re-examine past interactions with him to see if he is always this selfish but you were just explaining it away with a story that made him look better than he is.\n\nCongratulations on all the work you did, and also all the work you are doing without him!!!", "OP, you are a much bigger and nicer person than I am. Not once did you remind him that the trip was to celebrate your progress in recovery after he broke your back. I would have. \n\nHaving said that, he was provided a couple of alternatives that were more than reasonable. And why is HE paying for a flight/travel for business? \n\nNTA. \n\nBut, he has shown you where you rank in his priorities.

Thankfully, you're making great progress.\n\nIt's completely understandable why this event would mean so much to you.\n\nPaul shouldn't have agreed to go the day earlier without talking to you first. Instead, he immediately told them he'd be there. He didn't prioritise you at all and is blaming you for the fallout.", "NTA - this is an incredibly important event for you, and he isn't willing to event mildly inconvenience himself.  I get it's an important work event, but he could attend your run.  He doesn't want to have to make the effort.  After the year you have had, that's really shit.  I am sorry OP.\n\nETA - I read the driving as being 6 hours each way.  It's 6 hrs round trip.  Sorry, but that's even worse.  he could EASILY drive back on the Saturday afternoon, have a chilled evening on Saturday relaxing and get his flight.  That's 3 hrs driving EACH DAY.  Plenty of people do more than that on their daily commute.  This is BS of the the highest level. OP ignore all the people here saying \"oh but he's going to be sooooo stressed poor dear driving 3 hours is soooooooo hard he can't possibly be expected to cope with that\"", "NTA. He could have easily flown out of the regional airport. This was to celebrate your recovery from something that he caused.  A good partner learns how to juggle these things. What if it was the same day of a kids high school graduation?  A funeral of a loved one? You learn to work these things out. This is coming from someone married for 42 years.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s the US, and not Korea for example where network events are basically a must. \n\nHe made a commitment to go with you and bailed on it for a work opportunity that could show up later on. That\u2019s a special date, if his employer can\u2019t understand that, is it a workplace he wants to work in ?\n\nAlso she offered so many alternatives and he just couldn\u2019t be bothered. \nThe sight trouble that would cause him to was valued higher than his partner feelings. \n\nI get that it\u2019s your inner monologue, but it\u2019s good that you\u2019re working on your resentment. You shouldn\u2019t late it tarnish your relationship or you\u2019ll never be able to move on. \nBut honestly on his side tho, if that were me just the guilt would have made me stick to that plan. \nIf I knew I had caused something like that, and my partner was healing from it, I\u2019d celebrate it with them. \n\nThis is really something I don\u2019t understand where people are like \u201cwell it wasn\u2019t my intention so people should just move on\u201d. People are so individualistic that makes me so angry.", "Opinions seem to be pretty evenly divided. I do want to clarify a couple things- I never tried to get Paul to come by saying or implying the injury was his fault. Yes, I was thinking it, but I\u2019ve never used that against him. There are obviously resentment issues which is something I\u2019m working through, but I would never say that to his face. \n\nA lot of people are saying iata because I was pressuring him to skip his work event. When I realized how important it was to him, I tried to compromise with him to be able to make both events happen. It was his refusal to compromise that was upsetting.", "NTA. First of all, I'm glad you've made such s fast and triumphant recovery after what has probably been a really emotional year for you. He committed first to be there for you on this weekend, and now wants to shake it up for box tickets? Absolutely not.", "NTA. It's fine that he wants to present well for work, but the fact that he isn't interested in compromising after ditching your plans without talking to you makes him a major AH. He seems to want you to make him feel good about his decision by giving him affection before he heads out, and ignoring your own feelings and hurt. You didn't ruin anything. I hope you have a great weekend celebrating your recovery.", "NTA. He blew off important plans for an optional work event. You even suggested an alternative that would have allowed him to attend both events, but he couldn't even do that.  And it's not at all unusual or unprofessional for people to inform new employers of preexisting travel plans. Jesus, there are a lot of bootlickers here.", "NTA he chose to put his work and his wants above you. Above an event already agreed upon. Could have been a great moment for him to build you up and share about the amazing partner he\u2019s with. Most people would have appreciated it and shown he sticks to commitments. Instead he\u2019s been a total ah about the whole thing.", "NTA. First anniversaries of traumatic events are really hard. I was in a head on collision and was mentally doing really well until about a month before the first anniversary, and it completely caught me off guard how hard it was going to be. I went from feeling amazing to suicidal and engaging in self harm for the first time ever in my life, genuinely believing the surgeons had made a mistake saving my life. It\u2019s a really difficult time and I\u2019m sure your emotions are all over the place right now. Sending love \u2764\ufe0f", "INFO:  how was he 100% at fault in the accident?  Seems like you\u2019re holding on to a lot of resentment for this.  Was he driving drunk/high?  Did he deliberately drive off a cliff?  I\u2019m trying to imagine a scenario where one driver is completely at fault.  Can you please elaborate?\n\n\nETA:  thanks for the reply - texting and driving - that\u2019ll do it.  I can see why you\u2019re holding onto resentment.  That was in fact 100% his fault.  Congratulations on your one year recovery!  So impressed with how far you\u2019ve come.  Enjoy your celebration!", "NTA. You gave a lot of reasonable alternatives to make both events work out for him.", "NTA. He should have flown out of the Regional Airport. Nothing about this was Mission Impossible. You often have competing responsibilities, he needs to work the plan. You don't appear to rise to level of importance where he considered your needs.", "YTA. His event is work and can shape his reputation and perception at a new job. You\u2019re trying to phrase it as choosing a baseball game over a celebration of your recovery but I see it as you asking him to choose a race over work. \n\nYou discussed \u201ccorporate kiss-ass culture\u201d in your post before so you understand exactly what is expected of Paul and how it could change his life. You spoke of Paul making good money, that implies he has a good job. If you enjoy the benefits of Paul working a good corporate job, you have to deal with the drawbacks as well.", "I understand your point, but if I was him, I would also be networking. Networking culture may suck but if you want to advance in your career, you kind if have to join in, especially in the beginning. \n\nYou're using guilt to get what you want. You mentioned it twice, in one post, that it was 100% his fault that you broke ur back. I can't even imagine how many times he has to hear it. And a whole weekend to celebrate you, in a town 3 hours away? The guilt is working I guess.\n\nYtA.  You can move your celebration, he can't move his event.", "If you\u2019re holding a car accident against him 1 year later, YTA. You had a choice to leave, but you chose to stay. That\u2019s manipulative af. Full stop. \n\nAlso, what he says about corporate culture doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t do what is expected of him at his job. Especially a new job. I understand your trip is important to you, but staying gainfully employee sounds equally important to Paul. Giving him the cold shoulder, playing childish games and ruining the last moments you had together solved what exactly?!", "YTA\n\nSlightly, I don't think it's right you're still punishing him for the car accident a year ago, that's something you need to address so it doesn't fester, because every-time you fight or he does something you don't like you can't whip that out to make him feel like shit.\n\nWhile I understand this is important to you, emotionally manipulating by crying and pleading isn't the way to be in a relationship, has Paul been a great support and partner over the past year? I don't think you should punish him for not being there on one day you run this marathon, work events are important to and he think this will be a great opportunity for him to network, just because you don't think it's important doesn't mean that it isn't for him.\n\nBut yeah the \"especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place\" comment needs to be addressed, that's not a great sign for the relationship if you're still blaming him one year later.", "YTA. Starting a new job is a big deal and you\u2019re asking him to establish, at the very start, that he doesn\u2019t take his job seriously. That\u2019s the message his not going sends. It will have long term consequences. His not going away for the weekend only has consequences for you and you. Congratulations on your recovery\u2014hopefully there will be many more opportunities to celebrate in the future in a way that doesn\u2019t place your ego over his career.", "I was going to say N-T-A because you offered a lot of reasonable compromises to him juggling both the work event and your anniversary run.\n\nBut your belittling of his work event and guilt tripping about the accident leads me to YTA. \n\nThe work event is important because as much as he might not like \u201ckiss ass corporate culture\u201d it can genuinely affect your long term career and given it\u2019s a new job he\u2019s not in an easy position to excuse himself without giving the wrong impression. I understand your disappointment, but you\u2019re not at all acknowledging the significance of something important and potentially necessary in his life.\n\nAlso, you can\u2019t hold the accident over his head forever. Well, you can, but if that\u2019s how you feel you can\u2019t stay with him and use it against him. If he\u2019s apologized properly and supported you through your recovery then he\u2019s doing the right things for you and your relationship and to make amends. I\u2019d also ask you to have some empathy for the fact that the anniversary may be difficult for him if he feels guilty.", "NAH. Although it sucks that he can\u2019t come to the race, and your progress is incredible and I\u2019m so happy for you, you can\u2019t back out of work plans at a new job. You can go together to the next one. Side note, to say he caused your injury in the first place is kind of a low blow. Accidents happen. Plans change. Such is life.", "YTA - it's a new job.  He needs to do some networking, particularly since he works remote.  It's not just a \"baseball game\" as you say and not just a social event.  You're out of your mind and need to let go of the clear resentment you have for the car accident.", "I think it is fantastic that you've recovered from your injury to the point you can do a 10K run on the first anniversary of the car accident. But I am confused by the repeated use of \"accident\" to refer to what happened when you are putting the blame on Paul. \n\nAnd just because he agreed to attend doesn't mean that he wanted to 'celebrate' the first anniversary of the day you were so seriously injured, which you clearly still blame him for. Just because you refer to it as a fun and positive way to celebrate your recovery does not mean he was looking at the day with the same mindset. \n\n>So I asked him to tell them he forgot he had a wedding to attend or something like that, and he said he didn\u2019t want to turn down the offer because it would be a \u201creally good networking opportunity\u201d.\n\nIn other words, you asked Paul to lie to his bosses in a way which could easily - either by posts on SM or a slip of the tongue comment - get back to them as a lie. You asked Paul to tell them that he'd forgotten something important, which doesn't show responsibility. And you asked Paul to pull out of the first networking opportunity, and the first opportunity to get to know his colleagues/bosses in a non-work environment.\n\nIt isn't clear from your post whether Paul had forgotten about the conflict when he was invited to the game, or whether he reluctantly accepted because he felt pressured into accepting (or indeed whether he was eager to jump at an excuse not to attend the celebratory run). I wonder did you even ask him?\n\nAnd as for your comment about him shooting down the cost of flying from the regional airport... Even if you have full knowledge of Paul's savings, the past year has probably made him well aware of one event could seriously impact his ability to work, and well as the impact of medical bills. But I've got to wonder, are you certain you are clear on the stability of Paul's finances? Or are you making assumptions here because his current income?\n\n>Now he\u2019s upset with me for \u201cruining\u201d our last day together and also for pressuring him to skip his work event. I think he\u2019s an asshole for prioritizing a baseball game over a celebration of my recovery, especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place. \n\nI can understand why you are both upset, but do you really believe he is prioritising the game, as opposed to prioritising his career?  \n\nAnd I do hope you didn't say last bit to him, otherwise it could well have been your last day together. \n\nI want to say N-A-H, here but frankly your lack of understanding is leading me to YTA.", ">considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place.\n\ni knew this was coming as soon as i read that he was driving in the accident, YTA either break up or get rid of your resentment before this becomes an abusive relationship", "YTA This is very unfortunate but it doesn\u2019t sound like he really has a choice. This is the first time he gets to see all of his colleagues and his bosses explicitly asked him to attend. It would like really really bad if he canceled. I get that you\u2019re excited about the run and it means a lot to you, but it\u2019s too big of an ask to cancel his first work obligation. I wouldn\u2019t drive for six hours for a one day visit before catching a flight either. That\u2019s disproportionate in my opinion.", "YTA. He's starting a new job and you want to stress him out by forcing him to go to this run despite any nervousness about the new job.\n\nBlaming him for the accident while simultaneously wanting to celebrate its anniversary isn't a good look. This isn't the sort of thing you celebrate.\n\nThe time to celebrate your recovery is a year from your recovery, not the accident anniversary so you can continue to guilt trip him.", "YTA for talking about how he caused your accident, over and over. \n\nIt was an \u201caccident\u201d not on purpose. If you had a car accident, would you be ok if someone you loved kept bringing up that it\u2019s \u201ctheir fault\u201d. How long are you planning on playing that card? \n\nNew work networking opportunity is fair reason to miss watching you run a 10k race. He would be driving on the road 6 hours in one day right before he leaves for his work trip. That was a bad idea anyway. \n\nBe happy you are able to recover and stop thinking that he owes you in a bigger way for driving the car that caused the accident.", "YTA for the emotional manipulation. You guilt tripping about the accident is 100x worse than him missing your race.", "YTA\n\nI am very sorry for the accident you were in and for the long, difficult recovery you endured. I also feel that you had a choice: the accident was Paul's \"fault\" so you either got to end the relationship and leave him, or you accepted this fact, forgave him and moved forward. Being bitter and holding it over him for the rest of your lives is not going to work. So if you can't let this point go, that it was an accident, no matter whose \"fault\" it was, and he doesn't \"owe\" you anything, you need to just end the relationship.\n\nAs for your celebration of recovery trip versus the business trip he's being both required and pressured to go on for his new job, I think he's between a rock and a hard place.\n\n>***I think he\u2019s an asshole*** *for prioritizing a baseball game over a celebration of my recovery,* ***especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place.*** *My friends are on my side but I\u2019d like some unbiased perspective.*\n\nI also think that if you've ever voiced the same \"the accident was his fault\" sentiment to him, or any of your friends or family members in the past year, he may not be as keen on coming on this trip, where you may subtly remind him, or he may be subtly reminded how you really feel on the subject. **The work trip may be providing the perfect excuse to get out of the recurring guilt trip.**", "YTA- yes, it seems to me he practically leapt at the chance to get out of that \"let's commemorate the accident\" trip you planned. To you it celebrates your progress, to him it may be a reminder of something he feels guilty about. He didn't do it on purpose, but you sure were quick to point out he's \"100% at fault.\" I can't really fault him for not participating in in order to build his new job connections, though, instead of a weekend focusing on what had to be one of the worst days of his life. I hope you both are/have been going to therapy to work out any unresolved anger/guilt that would be an understandable reaction to such a major trauma.", "YTA. \nThe \"alternatives\" you're offering aren't good alternatives.

A year ago we were in a car accident- Paul was driving and 100% at fault. Paul had no injuries, but I broke my back. I was in a back brace for months and am still going to PT. After I was out of the brace I started going to the gym and running, and at this point I\u2019m in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been in. I\u2019m really proud of the progress I\u2019ve made. \n\nA month ago I found out that there was a 10k race on the 1 year anniversary of the accident in a mountain town about 3 hours away. I thought this would be a fun and positive way to spend the day and celebrate my recovery. I suggested this idea to Paul, my 2 best friends, and their partners- the plan was to drive there Friday afternoon, run the 10k Saturday morning, and spend the rest of the weekend exploring the town. Everyone was on board. \n\nPaul recently started a new job. It\u2019s fully remote and he hasn\u2019t met his coworkers yet. He is supposed to fly to SF to meet his team the Monday after our weekend trip- we knew this when we made our plans. \n\nA few days before our trip, Paul told me his bosses now want him to be in SF on Sunday because they got box seats to a Giants game and they want him to come, so he would no longer be able to come on our trip. I thought he was joking, because he makes fun of \u201ccorporate kiss-ass culture\u201d, but he was serious. I told him to explain the situation and that they can\u2019t expect him to be available with less than a week\u2019s notice. He said he had already told them yes and he didn\u2019t want to backtrack. So I asked him to tell them he forgot he had a wedding to attend or something like that, and he said he didn\u2019t want to turn down the offer because it would be a \u201creally good networking opportunity\u201d. \n\nI suggested he join on Friday as planned and drive back late Saturday or early Sunday to catch his flight. He said no because he didn\u2019t want to drive 6 hours round trip just for one day. I suggested he fly out of the regional airport nearby, which he also shot down because it would be too expensive (he makes good money so this wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden). I was almost in tears at this point, pleading him to come and telling him how important it was to me. When I realized he wasn\u2019t going to budge, I stopped trying to convince him, but I did let him know I was hurt and angered by his decision. \n\nThe morning I was supposed to leave, Paul was trying to be affectionate and sweet towards me, but I\u2019m still pretty upset, so I was admittedly pretty bitchy to him and rejected all attempts at affection. Now he\u2019s upset with me for \u201cruining\u201d our last day together and also for pressuring him to skip his work event. I think he\u2019s an asshole for prioritizing a baseball game over a celebration of my recovery, especially considering he\u2019s the one that caused my injury in the 1st place.

Or at least do some sort of celebratory experience/activity together that week when you\u2019re back together?\n\nI know a woman who survived a horrific car accident many years ago now, and every year on the anniversary she holds a huge party to celebrate still being here. \n\nHim not being with you for the race must be upsetting, but I hope you absolutely smash it!

He's TA. \n\nAlthough I do agree that adding the part about the accident being his fault was below the belt. It really doesn't have anything to do with the present situation. Please don't use that as a cudgel against him for the rest of your relationship.", "I would look at this in the context of how much is Paul generally present and engaged in your life and events? Forget about who caused the accident. Did Paul 100% help and support you with your long and painful recovery? Is he a partner that prioritizes you and your time together over his own pursuits? Does he often plan and initiate the things you do together and is an enthusiastic participant? If yes, then he does have a right to make this one-off event his priority (his job will carry on into the future and his event can help him advance; your recovery is complete and you will be celebrating what is now hopefully a closed chapter in your life).\nIf he is always off to do his own thing and trying to avoid participating in what is important to you, then yes, you are right to be upset.", "Is it possible that he is feeling guilty and is trying to avoid the run as he knows the car accident will be brought up alot and even though it is celebrating your progress he is trying to avoid the situation as it will bring up the event over and over?", "NAH. The real problem here is that he said yes first to the change in the work trip without consulting you first, knowing that this was an important event for you. He has every right to further his career and I'm sure he saw this change as a necessity but he should have still consulted with you first before saying yes.", "I realize how that comes across, but I do want to say I never said or implied that to Paul, it was basically my inner monologue. I\u2019d be lying if I said there weren\u2019t any resentment issues from the car accident but it\u2019s something I\u2019m working through. The celebration is exactly that. It was a really shit year for me. I was unable to work for 6 months. I was in an unbelievable amount of pain. I wanted to celebrate how much progress I\u2019ve made, and that\u2019s always how I framed it to Paul- it was never an intent to guilt trip him.", "I mean it\u2019s rude, but it\u2019s true\u2026", "Will you still punish him when he gets back? How long will you hold onto this for? The biggest out of this for me is the comment about \"especially because he caused this injury\" now I know you said you have never said this to his face (thank god) but you think therefor the built up resentment is eating at you, and I'm not sure how you're working through that feeling but now you are upset at him for not coming to this important 10k run anniversary, so now this is another thing you will bottle up and resent him for, you see how this can start to pile up?", "That\u2019s because all the compromises are not reasonable. Have you ever had to drive 6 hours, catch a flight, and then have to work? Because trust me, attending a game as a company event is definitely work. You have to network and be careful what you say and build relationships with the team and it\u2019s very VERY hard to actually rest and have fun.  Looking in from the outside, it\u2019s easy to assume he will be going there to have fun, but companies don\u2019t spend money for their people with no reason. You should be supporting him in going to work, not encouraging him to lie to skip work, or pressure him to burn himself out before getting to work. Because if you only see it as him going off to have fun, you\u2019re having a wrong view of corporate events", "He was charged with a misdemeanor for the crash. He was looking at his phone and drove off the road. It wasn\u2019t a cliff but it was a very steep hill. So no, he didn\u2019t do it deliberately, which is why I used the term accident, but yes, he was 100% at fault.", "Which is why I tried to compromise with him to make both events happen. It was his refusal to compromise that upset me.", "And even if you make good money, overpaying on a flight is still a waste of money!", "I mentioned this in another comment, but I want to clarify I never said that to Paul. There are resentment issues which is something I\u2019m working through but I\u2019ve never said anything like that to him.\n\nI understand networking culture is important, which is why I gave him a couple alternatives to make both events happen.

She saw right through it.    If he wants this to resolve he needs to own that he screwed up with her, and apologize.

Then they can move forward.  \n\n\"Ruining the last moments\" let him know that he can't make it better by a couple of hugs and a little sweettalk, so the 'what it solved' is letting him know that she is still hurt that he just threw her aside when he found something that would benefit him.  It is part of standing up for herself and saying this is not acceptable.  Better would be to straight up tell him I am still hurt by your disregard for me and I really can't be around you today, and much much worse would be pretending everything between them is sunshine and roses. \n\nLet him spend the weekend thinking about who he wants to be, and how to do better next time.", "That\u2019s fair enough regarding your first point. However, I will point out that I gave him a couple alternatives to make both events happen, and it was his refusal to compromise that upset me the most, especially considering this trip had been planned and booked in advance, and it was pretty shitty for me to suddenly be the 5th wheel.", "How the fuck is her crying manipulative?

He could have made both work if he wanted to.", "His carelessness caused a car crash. As per OP he was charged for it. With this info, it's not an accident, it's someone behaving like an idiot behind the wheel.", "Maybe I should have used the word crash instead. Paul was charged with a misdemeanor for the \u201caccident\u201d. As to his finances, we\u2019ve been together for 4 years and live together. I\u2019ve seen his bank statements. We\u2019re both very comfortable financially and money is not a concern.", "Without going into too many details, he was charged with a misdemeanor for the \u201caccident\u201d. Maybe crash would have been a better word choice because accident implies there was no one at fault.", "Even if you don't say this out loud to Paul, harboring a resentment like this and using it as 'he owes me cos he caused this accident therefore he will go where I point' is going to bleed out in ways you don't really have to express outright.\n\nTo be honest, I stopped a bit at 100% Paul's fault and then stopped completely midway through the post because it does not seem completely relevant to your post. Personally for me, if this is something that I am unable to move past, then this relationship isn't going to last. Cos he's gonna spend the rest of his days trying to make it up to you and you're going to continue to harbor this resentment.", "Right or wrong, resentment is obvious as are guilt trips.", "But you did guilt trip him? Crying and pleading for him to come is massively guilt tripping, making him feel like a piece of sh\\*t for trying to improve his work life.\n\nIf he has been a great BF and support partner over the past year, I think it's unfair to punish him for one day of not being able to celebrate this occasion with you, it's symbolic yes but it doesn't mean he puts you last.", "He didn't have to work, they invited him to a sports game.

Now he\u2019s a liar to his bosses.", "Compromise is about two people making concessions.  All the burden to make this work is on him....which is expected since you've spent the last year holding the accident over his head.  You've intentionally put him in a very difficult, very stressful situation just to punish him.  I wonder if he's only still with you out of guilt?  Damn....just let him go already.", "Your compromise was not realistic.  I think he should have let you know before he made the work commitment, but I don't think you're being realistic about his ability to not take part in this work event or successfully work around it to do both in the way you're suggesting.", "Another way of saying this is \u201csupporting his gf is a waste of money!\u201d", "Just reading through the alternatives were stressful.

The option to fly out was the best, but he couldn't possibly fly out early Sunday if he needs to be there on Sunday, he probably wants to get there with plenty of time and not be stressed. Just as your weekend is important to you, this trip is also very important to him.\n\nHe was going on this anniversary trip with you, but a last minute thing came up he was invited to and he probably thought it was a great way to socially bond with his co-workers in a little more fun/relaxed setting, those kind of things are gold when you haven't met anyone yet, more important that a lot of people think.", "Both alternatives made for a stressful start to his work trip though. He is probably really nervous/anxious for this trip, and wants it go well, the driving up then back in less than 24 hours isn't ideal.

Skipping out on it can make him seem like not a team player, which can cost him his job, which would affect both of you. \n\nWhile it sucks that he can\u2019t be there for your anniversary, pressuring him so much witth unreasonable alternatives is not very understanding of you. Please be more understanding that he sometimes needs to prioritize work, especially if it\u2019s a new job, and particularly if he\u2019s working remotely.

I bet even though this is a celebration for you, to him it's going to feel like a weekend of being reminded of how badly he hurt his partner. I'm not saying that makes it okay to bail -- he needs to suck it up and be supportive.

I can understand why she would be upset and resentful if her injury was because he did something reckless (& illegal) that endangered her life, but wasn\u2019t willing to tolerate any inconvenience to himself in order to support her.

That seemed horrible at the time, leading to an extremely one sided relationship. I do think it's un-empathetic to discount tears as a valid emotional outlet, they are, but it's also naive to think that some people won't use it as an excuse to use your compassion against you, and women are more likely to do this than men because more often they don't mind the vulnerability of the tactic.

I understand choosing and working full blinders and ignoring your family for your job is bad (that movie trope of a father depicted working 24/7, missing all aspects of his kids and wife's life).

When and how often should we be drawing that line to possibly put our job at risk and risk livelihood, income, security for our families wants/emotional needs.\n\nI ask for two reasons. #1...on Reddit we objectively unanimously treat income and individualism as our right to do what we want. I pay for half the apartment in my long term common law relationship, I can do whatever I like in my half without having to ask or justify myself, my space my rules. I've seen this take precedence over the feelings, the wants of the other partner. \n\nAn example - \"my SO cooks for herself most days and I usually buy takeout on my way home. I save the leftovers for work sometimes and she knows this but one day she went in the fridge and ate my takeout. I got mad bc she knows these are mine and she cooks for herself. I paid for this with my own $ AITA? - OP you are NTA, you bought it yourself and that's simply it, it's yours. She should ask next time but ultimately it's yours to do with it what you want.\"\n\nSo here while you could easily say, that doesn't make sense, they just need to communicate, she just needs to ask or speak first.. She is not entitled to something that's not hers. ~ That's not the issue I'm highlighting, it's individualism over the collective good. \n\nSecondly my partner has a job he's been at for 6 years and has constantly been promoted because he's really good and the company is small. He hit his ceiling though when he realized bc he didn't\"network\", go to the company hockey and baseball games just to get drunk or shoot the shit with the bosses, he can't go up. His boss literally said on his 1-1, time for you to come to our stuff more and we're going to be moving you to contact negotiation. I used to feel neglected bc he was so busy, but he makes double my salary and one day he gave me the option of him quitting just for us and bc his field is niche he would have to go to a job less than my salary. That reality scared me, were trying to buy a house and we would never reach that goal, or if we already lived in a house we'd lose it bc we would no longer be able to afford mortgage. If we had kids we'd be putting them through possible poverty. I grew up on welfare and financial security of a fear of mine.

That would seem totally reasonable to me. Now, I wonder if deep down, if Paul isnt also dealing with some internal guilt that he doesn't know how to deal with it. I'm going to give Paul the benefit of the doubt and make a big assumption that he was there for you in your recovery (btw, congratulations you obviously kicked ass the past year and you should be proud of yourself) But I could totally see as a male staying \"strong\" and internalizing his own struggle. This 10k race very well could have been an incredible guilt trip for him (in his eyes, not insinuating that you would guilt him). Now that you have kicked ass and taken names in your recovery, he definately would need to communicate that with you but as a male I know how big of struggle that can be and how easy it is to use work as an escape, coming from experience. But hey, this is coming from someone who refused to deal with my internal struggle and would use work as an escape and ended up divorced. Not blaming the ex by no means but how different it could have been if just once she would have came to me (granted at times i was very closed off) and allowed herself to unpack some of my baggage instead of me allowing myself to be an emotional dump(because i would rather deal with others shit than my own). Relationships aren't 50/50 sometimes its 100/00 or 00/100. Before taking it at face value that it's about work, maybe dig a little bit deeper and see how Paul really feels.

She just said that the event was important to her as a whole and she wanted him there. \n\nIt sounds like an issue of semantics, but in a relationship you can't skirt around things like that when it's not precisely what you mean.

Networking can open new doors, however, it does not have to do so. It is simply an opportunity. Additionally, money is great, however, its significance has its limits in one's life,  and as seen in the comments, OP had made it clear that they are very comfortable and money is not a concern. At that point money stops bringing more happiness into your life.  \n\n\nIt is better to have one's priorities straight and go for that which is meaningful in spirit, rather than finances, as long as it does not place one's financial comfort at risk. A one-in-a-lifetime event that is meaningful should be placed about an event that may or may not hold meaning in the long term. Even if, being a bit tired from driving to make it to both events could have a significant impact on this networking, that extra money he could make, is not something he will be able to take to his grave.", "Yeah, but honestly saying to her \"I feel too guilty about this to be able to celebrate with you, it's a me thing\" is waaaaaaay different from \"oh, got a better offer\" which appears to be how this is going. If it was the former, N A H.", "My grandfather, the wonderful person that he is, used to leave his house at 5am and drive 5 hours to my college campus to pick me up and drive straight back so that I could spend the weekend with him and my grandma a couple times a semester. He often drove the whole time, both legs of the trip. He's an awesome dude. I also think he enjoyed getting away from my grandma for a whole day.", "I lived in Texas, three hour drive was just table stakes for a fun weekend in Austin, I can knock out a three hour drive in a car with a broken AC and a radio that only tunes to the AM band. OP's husband is a whiney wiener.", "nah, these people are tripping. you didn\u2019t say it was his fault out of resentment. you said it in frustration, bc that is the subtext of this event as it pertains to your injuries and recovery. NTA for a mile this guy is being an inconsiderate AH. good job on your recovery, sounds really impressive. sorry this can\u2019t be a more joyful event for you \ud83d\ude14", "Has he been an overall worse or better partner after the accident?", "Jesus, thank you for summing this up in a way I couldn\u2019t. The top fucking comment on this post asks OP if this entire event is just to \u201crub Paul\u2019s face in it\u201d.", "Not even 6 hours each way! Sounds like 3 hours (so 6 for a round trip), Paul just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cworth it\u201d to drive 6 hours total for \u201cjust\u201d 1 day.", "Right, like what the fuck! She was in a god damn back brace SIX MONTHS AGO, and now she\u2019s running a race. Six months later. That is absolutely incredible, and I can\u2019t believe he just thinks it\u2019s totally ok to skip this.", "Wait,  he didn't even let you know apologetically?", "Then why is he choosing it, and not doing a reasonable compromise?  It makes no sense unless he doesn't want to be there", "For real \ud83d\ude44 \u201che\u2019s a man like of course he\u2019s gonna be shitty? People are still people like you have respect each other. It\u2019s not his responsibility to make sure you\u2019re not mad after he literally almost killed you? Have you ever thought he\u2019s jealous of the fact that you\u2019re fit after having to recover from a traumatic life altering event he solely caused? Men don\u2019t want a needy partner just get over it\u201d \n\nIM SORRY BUT NO", "u/Aitathrowaway329 I'm asking this earnestly, why are you still with this man? He seems to show no care or compassion for you (heck even remorse for causing this horrible year for you).\n\nHe refuses to attend giant milestones in your recovery because it might be *boring*. YOURE RUNNING 5K AFTER HIS BS TEXTING WHILE DRIVING BROKE YOUR BACK. That's not boring that's a *freeeeaking personal miracle* and he should be there with banners and posters cheering you on, that's being supportive and proud, not just saying good job  as long as it means he doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to.\n\nDid he really just stop bothering to drive you to appointments as soon as he could? Even if you could drive yourself, why wouldn't he still do it to let you recover more? Being independent is fine, but the point of having a partner is to be there to support that person, even if they could technically do everything themself.\n\nThis whole post just makes him sound selfish/self centred and like he doesn't actually think about you or how things affect you, I mean, this was an important milestone for you and he just bailed without even checking that it might be alright and he had so many ways to compromise.", "Proud and supportive feels...off to me in this context.  I can't really say why. It just kind of feels like, awesome, my gf is gonna be super hot and fit vs oh thank goodness, I didn't cause permanent damage and am so thankful she can even walk much less run.\n\nIt doesn't feel like he's sorry, tbh. He could have destroyed your life and it was only through your team of doctors and your hard work that you're doing so well. Whereas he is...bored?", "Listen to your own intuition OP.....\n\nYou know your relationship better than a bunch of internet strangers. And, it sounds like you have a pretty good idea that this man may not be the supportive partner that you want (or need.)", "Fr, and to add, from this story he doesn't seem too supportive or remorseful either. This was probably her way of finally allowing that forgiveness despite the situation, as you said. Def a bigger picture thing.", "Right. There's a difference between guilt-tripping and just having normal feelings. Getting injured like that in a car crash can be traumatic and probably not something you can get over so quickly, even with support.", "Idk, he's a lazy asshole? He doesn't feel this is important enough for him to be inconvenienced by it because he doesn't acknowledge how significant it is.\n\nI might just be pointlessly nitpicking the difference between 1. actively trying to get out of doing something versus 2. not caring enough about something to make it happen despite it not being convenient. Ultimately they wind up with the same result and Paul is an asshole.", "Genuinely think they forget how quickly something can go wrong and that they don't respect what they're driving and the damage it can do.", "I think there is 3 sides to a story, op\u2019s side, the partner\u2019s side and the actual truth. Op I\u2019m sorry to hear about your accident but it\u2019s good to know you are on the road to recovery. Hopefully you guys are able to work on bettering your relationship because it doesn\u2019t seem like it is for either of you guys.", "NTA\n\nYou need to let go of the resentment you obviously feel towards Paul as the person who caused the accident. If you can\u2019t forgive him, you need to end the relationship.", "ESH, I totally get wanting to have your bf at this race especially with all you've had to overcome since the accident. I don't think you're the AH for wanting that. I also don't think he's the AH for needing to be at a 'rubbing elbows' meeting with his new boss and the timing is bad. If you both want this relationship to work, post accident learn to forgive each other for things beyond your control while still supporting each other's goals. Even though the accident was his fault it's still an accident and I'm sure he's horrified about what happened (if not, I can't see why you'd stick by him). As terrible as it is, it's a reminder that bad things can happen at any time and to be grateful for every moment. You should definitely feel accomplished, and I hope you are able to reframe your pride for yourself and not for anyone else.", "I\u2019m sure op\u2019s husband has enough money for Spotify premium, driving with music should not be that big of a deal, if not fun (not counting parts on the highway)", "I mean, I get where she is coming from but if I were him, it would feel like a massive guilt trip celebrating the fact that I didn't permanently paralyse or kill my girlfriend because I did a shitty thing driving", "This is the same pattern of selfishness and carelessness and not giving a shit that causes a texting while driving car accident", "Grrrr! Horrible.   \nIt will inconvenience him to have to pack his shit and GTFO, but too bad!", "Let's swap your place with his. Imagine you made the terrible choices he did,  with him in the passenger seat. The guilt you'd feel, the regrets you'd express, and the desire to nurse him through his recovery. Imagine him hitting recovery milestone after milestone despite unremitting pain and due in large part to sheer force of character. How relieved you'd be and how eager to support him in his journey toward recovery. \n\nThat's what love looks like. Responsible, selfless, full-hearted love. When's the last time he showed anything like it to you? When is the last time you took a break from tough self-sufficiency and allowed yourself to be cared for? \n\nI don't even know you and I want to cheer for you. You deserve so much better than you've got. Run your race and keep running toward whatever (and whomever) makes you happy. You've more than earned it.", "Sweet girl, I think some reassessment of why you're with this man is in order. He is not your person.", "I think what really bugs me about this is that I don\u2019t believe for a second that his new boss is pressuring him to fly up on a SUNDAY for a baseball game. Did they invite him? Sure, I believe that. Did they say it\u2019s be great if he could make it? Sure, I could see that also. Did they pressure him so much he thinks it\u2019s mandatory? Highly unlikely. They want him to work for them, they aren\u2019t going to alienate him right off the bat (haha, pun intended). And if they did, then this is a huge red flag and something that will for sure affect your future with him anyway. \nHe wants to go. It\u2019s box seats at a giants game. Sounds amazing. It also lets him not feel all the guilt he likely hasn\u2019t dealt with for causing the accident and all it\u2019s fallout. NTA, OP. But also, this is something that needs to be addressed together if you guys plan to stay together.", "FWIW, my partner loves to run and has been running 5ks, 10ks, and a few half marathons for several years now. I still go to every event when my schedule allows, even the small ones, because I want to support his hobbies and I truly share his joy when he crosses the finish line. I would never in a million years call my partner's hobbies boring and mean it. I hope all these comments are a huge wake up call for you, OP.", "You would think he would *want* to be there", "Lmfao, that\u2019s their favorite line. And it applies here so well.", "and it's not \"for the rest of his life.\" It's after a year. Almost immediately after she's done recovering.", "That is TERRIFYING. Not to mention all the gun issues going on nowadays. Someone could just step out of the car and shoot you!!", "NTA FWIW but it doesn't really matter who is the ahole here because you've got bigger problems. \n\nMay I suggest some couples counseling? Or you alone if he won't go? Because you seem to resent him for causing the wreck and he doesn't seem to want to acknowledge his part in your disability (just a guess, that's why he's noping on the trip: he didn't want to go anyway. Guilt maybe? Denial? I can't imagine not wanting to be there for such a milestone). \n\nI think you two need to learn I talk to each other about this and work on that. You can't expect him to spend his entire life making up for it, guilt tripping is not a healthy way to handle this. Nor can he ignore it. This relationship is not sustainable.", "NTA\n\nso not only are you holding the burden of the hurt you feel at not having a partner support you after you've achieved so much but your also now having  his guilt and emotional burden laid on you as well.\n\nI do have to wonder though if he himself doesn't feel some guilt about the accident and that's why he was so quick to say yes. The whole day would be all about you overcoming things but you can't tell that part of the story without the part where he was driving. \n\nIt's clear he either feels guilt or knows about your resentment over it, you say your working through this but is he? I hope you can talk more openly about this soon so it doesn't start to drive a wedge between you", "This is the worst take dressed up in therapy-speak", "She even provaded him two options that would allow him to at least be there for the big moment and still go to the baseball game. And both of them where reasonable/durable but he still refused to go....", "Dude literally broke her back because he was on his phone while driving and now can't be bothered to be with her when she celebrates her recovery from the injury **he caused.** When exactly do you believe it's appropriate to break up with someone if not under these circumstances? Posthumously after they've murdered you in cold blood?", "I'm confused as to why you're still with him", "OP, Why are you with someone who hasn't helped you at all recover from something he is the major cause of? He doesn't respect you, your time or even your relationship. \n\nSeems like he doesn't want to celebrate your milestone as a constant reminder of what he did, so rather be lazy and avoid the issue. \n\nYou deserve better. He ain't it", "That's why I think he's skipping, he's consumed by guilt.", "It\u2019s not that you\u2019re wrong, but this might be the type of thing that cuts a relationship. Because frankly, he should feel that way without prompt. He shouldn\u2019t beat himself over the back forever but all things said, he should absolutely feel obligated to go to this. A good partner who genuinely feels bad about the situation would at least act *guilty* over backing out. This accident has become a major part of their lives whether they want it to or not. If OP cant fully get past it especially after less than a year, that\u2019s valid. If he can\u2019t handle the guilt weighing on their relationship forever, that\u2019s valid. But there are decisions to be made.", "Why is it on OP to forgive, and not him to *earn* that forgiveness? Sounds like OP has been pretty damn busy herself just trying to recover, but her husband's response is to blow off every option to show his love and support the day she needs it most.", "5. Expects sex and gets shitty when turned down. \n\nNTA.", "Exactly!", "While yes, your physical and mental health is always your responsibility, being there to support a partner who you are at fault for putting them through physical and mental health, to the point where they needed that rehabilitation to get better, is the very least you can do. He can afford to skip out on a baseball game to support the partner that he (Even being an accident) severely injured.", "But here's the thing, if you already had a previous engagement, sticking to that and communicating that with your bosses shows them that you prioritize commitments that you have already made, and that you don't just flake out on something that you've committed attending in favor of something better. It actually makes you look even better in a boss's eyes sometimes. At least if your boss is a decent person that is. Or if they have any good business sense."]}
