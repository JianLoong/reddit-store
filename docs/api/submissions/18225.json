{"id": 18225, "submission_id": "13sf11h", "title": "AITA for not inviting my girlfriend as my plus one to my sister's wedding?", "selftext": "My girlfriend (f29) and I (m23) met in tinder over a year ago, it was casual at first but then we officially started dating officially. She has a nine years old daughter and a four years old son. Our relationship is great, thought I'm busy with college and she's busy with the kids and work sometimes so we can't see each other than much, but we male up the lost time whenever we can. She has met my family before, it was for Christmas, I also met her family for new years Eve.\n\nWell I'll go straight to the point, my sister (f26) is getting married next Saturday. She said that I can bring my girlfriend and the kids if I want to (my sister lives kids so she loves my girlfriend's kids). I told her I wasn't sure about inviting her and the kids because it's too soon for that, she understood and told me I can do whatever I want, but if I want to invite them then it's fine with her and her fiance. \n\nTime went by and honestly I haven't changed my mind about it. My reasons to not inviting them is that I know I will have to look after the kids too and honestly I just want to have fun at the wedding, also we only have been dating for a couple months so it's kinda weird to take her as my plus one to a wedding. She's also always nagging me when I drink alcohol so I want to avoid that if possible, I don't plan on getting wasted at my sister's wedding but I do think I'll drink a bit and maybe after the wedding I'll go out with friends or something, we're still thinking about that. So as I'm possibly gonna go out with friends afterwards I thought I'd invite my friend (f23) who's been my friend for a long time to come to the wedding and we can hang out later with some other friends (some of my friends are invited to the wedding too as they're friends of the family at this point) \n\nWhen I told this to my girlfriend she went nuts, she got very angry and told me I'm just playing with her because I don't consider her important enough to invite her to the wedding with me. Since I told her this she's been nagging me about taking her to the wedding, kinda like an ultimatum, and as I told her yesterday that my plans haven't changed she's been giving me the cold shoulder now\n\n\nEdit: well, since everyone is telling me I should've included it in the post, here it goes. My friend is also my ex, we dated for a while a couple years ago. My girlfriend doesn't like my friend but I feel like she should trust me that I won't do anything since I always trust her when she goes out with her ex (without the kids) and she won't even tell me where they are going or what will they do, she always tells me I don't need to know that and I should trust her so I just keep quiet and trust her, then why is now different? She should trust me too, and at least I told her what my plans are, she doesn't tell me anything.", "created_utc": 1685112042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sf11h/aita_for_not_inviting_my_girlfriend_as_my_plus/", "score": 488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems to me that you are a bit too immature for this relationship and honestly, it would be best for your gf if she realizes this. \n\nThe least you can do is understand how she is feeling: not taking her, replacing her with another female friend - this could be very hurtful.\n\nYou basically described her as a chore - she has kids and is nagging you - and I don't really see if you're even having any fun / are happy with her. What's the point of this relationship then?", "Red flags all over this one buddy. You're 23. Your girlfriend is 6 years older and already has two kids.  It's clear that you're not ready to be in a serious relationship with this lady - which is cool.  BUT your family seems to know her kids well. If you're not serious enough to bring her to your sister's wedding why does your sister know her kids?  Gotta go with YTA.  Stop playing with this lady.  She needs to be looking for a serious partner and not fooling around with college kids.", "it\u2019s fair that your girlfriend would be upset (this would be grounds for a breakup for me because it feels disrespectful) but I also understand why you don\u2019t want to bring her. However it sounds like she honestly isn\u2019t what you want. If you don\u2019t want your partner with you at an important wedding (even if you found a babysitter) then you should reevaluate your relationship with her - you may be in different stages of life\n\nEdited to change judgment to YTA because you\u2019re bringing another girl to the wedding. Just break up with your gf if you dislike her that much", "YTA. Why are you even in a relationship with her if you're in such a different life phase? I get being young and wanting to have fun, that's fair. But if your level is there, you shouldn't be dating someone with kids who is clearly wanting more stability. Then to add insult you ask your \"friend\" and are taking her out after? Duh your partner is going to be pissed.", "YTA\n\nIf you don't want to take gf, that's one thing.\n\nIf you take a different female, that's completely a different thing.\n\nOne says that your relationship with gf isn't at that stage yet, the other says you prefer other female to your girlfriend.\n\nGoing solo might be the wisest course.", "YTA. You don't like her that much. Stop wasting her time.", "YTA and honestly, if you aren't ready to have her as a guest at a wedding, you shouldn't have spent Christmas together, but more importantly, you shouldnt even be involved with her children.", "YTA - and clueless. Picture a scenario where your GF gets invited to a wedding and tells you you are not invited, then goes and takes her good long time friend (29m) along for the party. If you say you wouldn't be bothered by this you are lying.", "Lol over a year and shes not ready to be taken to a wedding?\n\nPeople will bring their 1st dates to a wedding and after a year youre not ready for wedding date?\n\nAnd you wonder why she feels like youre stringing her along?", "YTA.  You had me going not the asshole until the end where you mentioned you invited another woman.  Of course you\u2019re GF is going to be upset!  Why wouldn\u2019t she be?  If you wanted to go and have fun, great!  But to bring another woman???  You completely disrespected your GF and she has good reason to be mad at you.  \n\nYou should tell your sister this story so maybe she could explain to you why your GF is so upset since you obviously don\u2019t understand.", "YTA. I'd have said N A H if you were going on your own, but inviting another woman? Raging AH move. Hope your gf stops wasting her time.", "If it\u2019s been 2 months and she\u2019s \u201cnagging\u201d you, you\u2019re already talking this way, you\u2019re not that into the relationship. Stop stringing her along. \n\nYTA simply because you\u2019re still dating her when you clearly aren\u2019t into her and would rather bring another woman to your sister\u2019s wedding. \n\nThe fact that your sister knows her kids is really what makes you out to be the asshole, because your sister clearly knows your GF and her kids where she feels comfortable inviting them to her wedding. If GF didn\u2019t know your family at all this would be different.\n\nYou sound like a mess.", "INFO - Have you ever been romantically involved with this friend you're wanting to take rather than your girlfriend?", "Uhm... yeah, soft YTA. Dude, you made it official a couple of months ago, but you've actually been dating for a year. She met your family for Christmas. Yes, it would kind of be expected that she'd be invited to the family functions. Also, to add insult to the injury, you are inviting a female friend to go as your plus one. If you just went alone, that would at least be understandable, but you are directly replacing her. Of course she feels like you don't actually see her as your girlfriend.", "YTA., you invited another woman as your plus one.  I get it, you want to cut loose at the wedding.  You don\u2019t want the responsibility of watching out for her kids.  \n\nYour gf comes with children.  That\u2019s not going to change.  Maybe consider being involved with her, at this stage of your life, is not a good fit.", "YTA you are not mature enough to date. woman with kids. \n\nIf you dont take your girlfriend and take another girl (long time friend or not) you may not have a girlfriend. but this sounds like it might be good thing for her if you broke up as you dont exactly seem keen on the relationship.", "YTA\n\nOf course it's not okay if you take some other girl to your sister's wedding instead of your actual girlfriend. WTF, dude?\n\nYou've been dating this girl, casually or seriously, for over a year. She has kids. No, it's not \"too soon\" for her to come to a wedding with you. You need to poop or get off the pot. If you can't get serious and decide you're in this thing, let her go find someone better.", "YTA, meeting families for the Christmas/New Year's wasn't too soon, but a wedding is? You're probably not going to have a girlfriend after this one.", "Massive YTA. Hopefully this girl dumps you over this. I would. So disrespectful.", "YTA and you shouldn\u2019t be together. You are in a life stage of looking for fun and she is deep into adulthood/parenting. That is fine. But you\u2019re not compatible and you\u2019re gonna make each other miserable. And you are FULLY the asshole for thinking about bringing another girl to a wedding you don\u2019t want to take your girlfriend to. Break up and then you can have all the no strings attached early twenties fun that you want.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not inviting her because you don\u2019t want her and the kids cramping your style. I mean, kind of a selfish position to take (and tells me a lot about how you feel about her AND her kids) but whatever. \n\nBut to invite a female friend instead??? Wow. You just told your gf in so many words that she means less to you than this friend AND that you don\u2019t care how she feels about it. \n\nShe has a right to be upset. Honestly, I\u2019d rethink the entire relationship. You clearly look at her kids as a burden and at her as there only when you feel like hanging with her and not as an important part of your life.", "YTA, but mostly for dating someone you're obviously not interested in.", "Would you be fine if your girlfriend brought her EX to a wedding ?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then you aren\u2019t that serious about her. And she is right - you\u2019re just playing with her and you shouldn\u2019t be dating.\n\nIf the answer is no, then you\u2019re being hypocritical  AH.\n\nUltimately both roads and at the same place  - YTA.", "YTA. This has to be a joke. I get your sorta young, but you're definitely old enough to not be this oblivious. You honestly believe it's okay to take an ex gf to the wedding because you dont want your \"nagging\" gf there? Outrageous! I wish we your gf could just see this post and your replies. It would be all she needs to realize you two aren't on the same page. Just leave your gf alone and go be single and enjoy yourself without disrespecting her.", "YTA.  All I had to do is read up to the point about watching the kids.  This is where you are YTA.  If your not willing to watch the kids during an advent where you are date or known a single parent for over a year, then you are not ready to date a single parent.    \n\n\nIt's okay to want to party and be fancy free during a wedding but you are dating a single parent for a time where it's natural to want to be included.  You are not ready, end the relationship since you told your girlfriend what you actually think.  But it may not matter now since you would probably be single anyway.  Do not date single parents until you grow up some more.", "YTA and NTA - you are in totally different places in your lives right now and you want to continue being the single man without responsibility. So NTA\u2026.. but you are not being honest with the gf and treating like someone you can pick up and put down when you feel like it. That\u2019s unkind. So YTA. \n\nYou need to decide if you and her have a future. And what she wants from you. If it\u2019s not compatible, it\u2019s time to separate.", "YTA.\n\nThis is a celebration of family and love - to not take the person you\u2019re dating, and especially to take another woman, even a friend, instead isn\u2019t a good look.

If it\u2019s you drinking that\u2019s a problem, that\u2019s an issue/conversation you should have already had tbh, and should now have, instead of avoiding it.", "YTA. It's fine if you don't want your gf's kids to come as you think your gf would be distracted. See if she can get a sitter and just the two of you go....
