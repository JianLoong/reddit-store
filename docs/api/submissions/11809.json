If you value your relationship with your father, it might be worthwhile to reach out to him so that he can hear your thoughts and feelings on the matter directly. \n\nGiven that he doesnt subscribe to the hate his family does on at least the presentation/surface level, he must be aware of how toxic it is. With the caveat that I only know what you've shared here, which includes nothing of his actual personality, my guess would be that he's avoiding contact more out of shame than anger.

It is unfortunate that you were not able to have an honest conversation with him in his moment of grief, but not as unfortunate as the rest of your family not respecting your wishes to avoid causing a scene, and not nearly as unfortunate as your father never giving you any insight into what on earth he was thinking not only not standing up for you, but co-opting your siblings into the toxic situation.\n\n>He\u2019s always been my literal real-life hero.\n\nThis is a little beyond the scope of this subreddit but it seems you have a real life Atticus Finch as a father--the sequel version that reveals you are the new hero and stand without him on the front line as an adult.

I really can't see why you'd want to attend the funeral of a bigot whoh consistently referred to you in racist terms.  With the rest of his family who were just as bad, if not worse.  How in the world could your father expect you to attend? It would have been a nightmare... and now,he's  still giving you the silent treatment a year later for not attending the funeral of a bigot, and spending time with the rest of his racist family.    \nBTW... your brother is an AH too for telling your father the reason why.
