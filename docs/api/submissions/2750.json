Creep. \n\nAlso, your mother saying it\u2019s not your home??? That\u2019s messed it up. It may not be your house but surely your parents home is your home.", "NTA\n\nA teenage boy came to stay with us for a few months, my bath robe disappeared the day he arrived and I got it back when he left.  I was so pissed about it that I burnt the robe.", "Feeling a bit out of place as someone from a large family who always shared towels, gotta admit. Idea of complaining about towels and the look my parents would have given me...hoo boy.\n\nThat said! He was provided a towel, peculiar and rude for him to keep forgetting it after you'd asked him to make the distinction. NTA", "NTA. Don\u2019t babysit. If I was you, I would also make that towel unusable. Add food coloring the same color as the towel so when he uses it he gets dye all over him. Wipe up a messy kid with the towel. Add some mud to it. Leave it in a ball in a plastic bag overnight so its moldy and smells weird. Whatever you have on hand that would be awful to get a face of. When people use other peoples\u2019 things without permission they are not owed any functionality for said item.", "NTA.  BIL is gross.  OP, wash the towel and then keep it in your room so he can't get to it.  And still don't babysit for them. (Personally, I'd make myself scarce for the next two weeks!)", "NTA. It's your towel, how hard is it to either grab the towel from your own room, or leave it in the bathroom. That is to a degree, disgusting to use someone else's towel.", "Disgusting. He could have crabs or any other disease and a wet moist environment like a towel could harbor bacterias and give your vaginosis. \n\nNo.\n\nA thousand times no! Not the AH!", "Someone else\u2019s butt juices? Yucky", "Stop leaving it in the bathroom. Easy fix.  I only reuse my towels once. Any more than that & it feels dirty. But i certainly wouldn't want to dry my face or any other body part with a towel someone else used on their junk, their ass or their feet. Nope. Not happening. I will keep mine in my room until they leave. Do you not keep a spare, clean towel in the bathroom?", "OP, each day they're there, you should change out the towel for each family member and see how they feel after finding out BIL used their towel and didn't wash it but put it back where he found it.", "I was thinking get a towel and some red dye and make a nice big splotch on it to look like period blood. Then fold and hang the towel on the radiator in a way where he won\u2019t see it until after he has dried himself with period blood towel", "[New Girl - Towel](https://youtu.be/QxdjPH0JrDM)", "Weaponized incompetence, he can\u2019t possibly remember to bring his own towel or remember what towel is his.", "Wouldnt that be hilarious if she left moms towel in their bathroom then put it back after he used it! Bet mom would deal w it then!", "YUP! I've done that a number of times growing up...Mainly to my twin sis...I FORGOT MY TOWEL!!! And her usual response - AGAIN!?! But she was always kind enough to pass me the towel through the bath door cracked slightly open.", "Tell that to my 2-in-1 washer/dryer machine... fucker takes 4-5 hours for 1 load \ud83e\udd23\n\nStill, you are absolutely correct, and even with waiting twice as long as most people, I ALSO can throw in a towel after a shower in the laundry and have it ready for the next day.", "No, there really isn't a sexual component to it.\n\nsome people just see a towel, as towel.  the idea that you connect sexual overtones to it seems overwrought.", "I agree and I also see a creepy sexual vibe.  If he simply forgot his towel he wouldn't fold it and put it back as it was found.  He wants her to use it after him without knowing he used it.", "NTA but also, if you\u2019re living there - isn\u2019t it your home then..?", "NTA - He's a creep.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t let them take advantage of you. Also, use a different towel that you will keep in your room and keep the one if the bathroom for wiping up the toilet. If you BIL happens to use it, too bad so sad.", "Nta. You don't want to share a towel with anyone least of all a man who has been drying his bits and pieces with said towel. Gross.", "NTA", "NTA blow this up! That perv is getting off knowing your face has indirectly touched his balls every time you touch your towel. The only reason a grown man wants to use a younger woman's towel so much knowing it's gross, knowing she hates it, not washing it, putting it back and only doing it late at night to not get caught, is because it's a power play for him. Why wouldn't his wife just bring him his towel if he \"forgot\" it?? It's intentional and their delusional.", "NTA, and your mom is an AH too for saying it isn't your home. Yes it is! You live there, how is that not your home? Just because you don't own it, doesn't mean you don't deserve safety and comfort.", "NTA\n\nIt seems like your BIL is a pervert. He knows that it's your towel and continues to use it. \n\nIt seems to me that he may be doing it because he gets off on you using the towel he uses in your body. It seems rather sexual to me. \n\nIt's also massively unsanitary to be sharing towels. Diseases can be shared by sharing towels - staph, conjunctivitis, trachoma, ring worm, etc. \n\nI would recommend your removing all your belongings from the bathroom (towels, toothbrush, hair combs, etc) so he doesn't use them because he obviously cannot he trusted.", "Why not bring your towel to your room? Why keep leaving it in the bathroom knowing it will continue to be used by your BIL. Some problems have simple fixes. He can\u2019t use what is not there to use.", "Poison ivy. Then there's no denying it when he uses it.\n\nMy grandmother's friend found out that the husband was cheating. She rubbed poison ivy in the master bed. Found out that the \"other\" was someone they knew.", "take my poor woman's award, because this was gold i never laughed so hard.... \ud83e\udd23\ud83c\udfc6", "Well, it is gross because he isn\u2019t at his own house and there is a young girl around who will probably feel intimidated habvng a half-naked man walking around the house..", "That\u2019s the problem for me!! I get out of the shower, and my towel is DAMP because Husband used it for his morning shower and it hasn\u2019t dried yet! It feels so clammy and skin-crawly; I hate it.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what gets me, he heard a teen girl saying his behavior was gross and weird and he continued to do it to her\u2026 that\u2019s purposeful at that point", "I know people who probably wouldn\u2019t think twice about just grabbing a towel off the rack and it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a power play they just have a different ick level. I\u2019ve had to explain to at least one person that just because you\u2019re technically clean after a shower, doesn\u2019t mean other people want to share your dead skin cells.\n\nETA: same people would stop after being asked to stop though, this has the feel of a power play or something weird"]}
