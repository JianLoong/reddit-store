She should have been more careful about where she set her phone but it's still on YOU to be aware of your surroundings when cooking, your reaction to being called out for your carelessness was awful and you definitely owe her an apology (and a phone case).", "NTA\nIt was her fault!", "Eh, I'm going against the grain to say NTA.\n\nIf you come into the kitchen, don't assume the stove hasn't been used. If you put things on there you only got yourself to blame. That's why we teach kids to NEVER touch the stove, not just when it's been on.\n\nAlso, a new case costs $1 on Aliexpress with any custom theme or motive you could ever think of. No need to get her panties in a bunch over that. Seems like she's fighting for the sake of fighting.", "INFO: was the phone there when you turned on the stove, or did she put her phone on a hot stovepop", "In your own telling of these events everyone sounds childish and insufferable. Also, the sequence of events is unclear.\n\nIf the phone was on the (cold) stovetop and you then used the stove and burned the phone, you need to take responsibility for that and replace the case.\n\nIf the phone was put down on a hot stovetop, that is your sister's responsibility.\n\nAccidents happen and it would be N-A-H if that was the full story, but the way you all have responded makes it closer to E-S-H.\n\nThis should be a simple sequence of normal adult conversations to resolve.", "Common sense is to move something flammable away from the stove when using it. Common courtesy is to do the same for other people or at least inform them of your intent to work in that area. You might think she \u201cjumped down your throat\u201d but I see this as a pretty normal reaction for someone who\u2019s just had their property needlessly damaged through carelessness and neglect. \n\nYTA.", ">The counter that the stove is on. I guess the stove but not the actual little circle that you cook on.\n\n**The whole square stovetop IS the stove, not just the little circles.**\n\nIf the phone was already there when you turned on the stove, ESH -- her, for leaving it there, and you, for not moving it when you got ready to turn the stove on.\n\nYou sound really young, and your parent(s) are TA for not explaining to you that the whole stovetop IS the stove. If you're 18+, then you're TA for getting this far in your life without figuring out that the whole stovetop gets hot when you turn on one of the \"little circles\".", "From your post history I am guessing your are 12 years old. Are you aware the entire surface of the stove heats up when it is turned on, not just the \"circle\" part? It's not a part of the counter. I will also guess you have an induction stove built into the actual counter. Please ask an adult to teach you how to use the kitchen appliances safely.", "ESH", "Option 1: It was hot enough to melt a phonecase and she didn't notice when putting her phone there? Judgement: dumbass\n\nOption 2: There was a phone on the stove and you just... went on to boil milk? Judgement: dumbass", "YTA\nDid you even warn her that the spot may be hot if you were in the same room?", "INFO: Was it on the stove or the counter near the stove? You said both in the same sentence.", "Tbf this isn\u2019t always the case. \n\nMy induction stove only gets hot where you have the pot placed and only on the hot plates- it won\u2019t turn on without the weight of a pot on it. Even when it is on full heat you can put your hand within an inch or two of the pot and it will be cold. It\u2019s a safety measure built into some of the new stoves so that you can\u2019t leave it running after you take the pots off or easily burn yourself. It does take a little while to cool down though. \n\nOn our old electric coil stove this was absolutely the case though, and I agree, OP should\u2019ve known their stove (unless they just moved in or something). I\u2019m much more careful with unfamiliar appliances.", "You are technically correct -- but be honest: would you ever put your phone on your induction stovetop? Or on anyone else's stovetop, even if you knew that it was induction? That would just be asking for one sort of disaster or another. \n\nJust like I wouldn't put my phone anywhere near a sink or a toilet or a ledge near a big height drop. Why court trouble? You put phones where they are less likely to get knocked or pushed into a damaging situation.", "I agree. I do occasionally leave it on the opposite side of the stove, but it\u2019s a big stove so that\u2019s more than forty centimetres away from the hot pot. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t do it on anyone else\u2019s."]}
