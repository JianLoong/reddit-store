I\u2019m done and I\u2019m in the kitchen, at the same time my sister has just finished heating her milk in the microwave. She\u2019s talking to me and we\u2019re both mixing the powder with me. Her phone is on the stovetop, not the actual stove but the countertop area near it, where the oven is, if that makes any sense. Anyways she lifts her phone up and realizes that her phone case has been burnt/melted in the corner. She immediately jumps at my throat and begins questioning me for this. I simply explain the the counter was hot because I had just used the stove to boil milk. She acts all pissy and then shows it to a family friend who\u2019s staying with us (I won\u2019t get into all that) and he immediately takes her side and starts getting mad at me for using the stove instead of the microwave. I already dislike him so i tell him to go to hell and then my sister calls me a crybaby. Like she wasn\u2019t the one being pissy over her phone case. I get why she\u2019s upset, but her blaming me and them immediately getting at my throat is what pisses me off, because they do this all the time and they always act like they don\u2019t. Of course I don\u2019t wanna say it was her fault, but then again, it was a hot stovetop.

But it's also her fault for leaving it there.", "ESH. they suck because they didnt use common sense that something near something hot MAY BE HOT STILL. and you didnt really need to react that way.  it's a soft ESH on your end, but the others need to take a chill pill.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
