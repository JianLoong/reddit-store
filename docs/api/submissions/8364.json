Yesterday my sisters friend (14) came over during the beginning of a huge snow storm to hang out. In order for her to come over she had to have a ride as our mom was already at work, and her ride already got into a crash on their way to our house due to weather. Two hours after she had gotten to the house friends mom started demanding that she needed to come home at that moment when the storm had picked up even more and I was not comfortable driving in that weather especially if I had to take a baby with me. Friends mom started threatening calling the cops if we didn\u2019t take her home. Friend is also on parole for supposedly stealing and has to be home by 9 pm. Then the mom started saying that she is considered a runaway and it\u2019s illegal to harbor one. Also I did tell the mother that she was free to come pick her up or could send her sister (who was at home) to come pick her up. Friend starts getting nervous as her mom keeps getting increasingly angry because I refused to drive in the weather and is now starting to threaten to send her to juvie. 8 pm rolls around and no sign of friends mom even though she is out of work and has been. She is purposely not picking her up and is going to force her to break (EDIT) probation. My mom finally got home and ended up taking her home in the crappy weather so she wouldn\u2019t break (EDIT) probation.

If you got stranded with bub things could get bad quickly. Only a very experienced driver should be driving anyway and i doubt you would have had it more than a few years.\n\nThe friend shouldn't have even gone out in the storm anyway, And parole at 14? Sounds like she makes bad choices all round.", "NTA, but everyone else is, including your sister. How much of a clusterfuck can this be?\nYour sister thinks it's a good idea to invite a friend at the start of a snowstorm. The friend thought it would be a good idea despite  being on parole. The girl's mum says yes. The ride gets into an accident and still nobody calls this bullshit off. Your mum is a Saint, but if I were her I'd forbid my kid to ever talk to that friend again. She might be a nice kid who made some mistakes, but her mother is clearly a hazard to your family.", "NTA. In the best of circumstances we are told to stay put during a storm. But to put a newborn in that situation for a non emergency reason? No way. If other mom wants to endanger herself and her own child,that's on her. But at any rate, her daughter being on parole is **her** responsibility,not yours. \n\nAlso, I didn't know that juveniles can be on parole.\n\n(If I were mom, I would call the non emergency police and tell them the situation and ask what to do. )", "NTA. You could have gotten in an accident and then you would be TA for making first responders go out and save you, your child, and or any other people involved. You made the right decision. However, if I was your mom I would reconsider letting my daughter hangout with someone on parole from juve. Clearly there is a lot of drama there with your sister\u2019s friend\u2019s home life.", "NTA. If mom cared that much she would\u2019ve picked her up herself but instead forced you guys with threats.", "NTA - and that miserable excuse for a mother is a total AH.  Tell her next time not to bring her kid to your home and deal with her own freaking transport issues.  Or next time you could call the cops yourself and let them know she abandoned the child at your place--see how she likes them apples.", "NTA, full stop.

Her mother and the girl are the AHs for putting someone in a situation where they have to drive in less then safe conditions.\n\ngf got ejected from her car during high school (not snowing but wet roads) so like hell I am risking anything because people can't read the weather before leaving the house.", "Friends mom sucks, she should have just gotten her child and not made it someone elses problem.

Your mom was way nicer than I would\u2019ve been.", "INFO\n\nWho made the call that the friend could come other in this weather and with the parole restrictions?", "NTA\n\nIif it was this big an issue that girls Mom shouldn't have let her come over in the first place, if the kid didn't bother to tell Mom - it's still Moms problem.  Mom can either pick her up/ send an Uber.  ~~Turns out Mom DID pick her up~~.  Mom's issue should be with her child Not you.  Also you were making sure her daughter was safe in a home with adult supervision (you) all day vs getting into trouble on her own.\n\n\\*edit reread & saw that your Mom got stuck doing this.", "Deffo NTA for thinking about yours and your babies safety.", "NTA. You are 19 and by definition have limited experience driving in the snow. You definitely don't want to drive a baby in that mess!

The friend's mother gave permission for her to go and you didn't agree to drive her back. It's not your responsibility to dive her back just because the person that drove her there got in an accident.", "Her mom gave her permission to come over.  It is up to the mom to get her home then.  Mom cannot \"take back\" permission in that manner.  She cannot say she is a runaway after giving permission for her to go.  I would have called the cops first and explained the situation.  They will then ask why she didn't come and get her then.   Mom sounds like trouble and probably why her daughter is acting out.   NTA", "NTA. \n\nnot your kid. If the mom doesn't care neither should you.", "NTA. That was not your responsibility.", "NTA - we've been having snow storms here that all of the law enforcement in the effected areas are using their FB & Twitter accounts to tell people it's unsafe to drive and not to do so if it can be avoided.    Your sister's friend should have not come over without knowing exactly who was taking her home and at what time.    She's engaging in risky behavior.", "NTA. You are responsible for your kid. And her mother seems to be the A here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Friends mom started threatening calling the cops if we didn\u2019t take her home.\" .. This is ridiculous. Tell her she is free to pick up her daughter any time she likes.  NOT YOUR DRAMA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Friend is also on parole for supposedly stealing and has to be home by 9 pm.\" .. This would be interesting to discuss with a lawyer: She is a minor, and her mom refuses to take her home on time. Her mom losing custody might not be a bad thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way: YOU are NOT the AH.", "NTA.  Baby is the priority, not a 14 year old child.", "NTA. It would be dangerous as a younger less experienced driver in bad weather conditions. What you did was the best and safest option. Even if she ended up in trouble for being there after 9, there are usually exceptions to those rules.", "NTA, but this would have been an excellent time to call the non-emergency number for your local PD. With the weather it\u2019s quite likely they wouldn\u2019t have sent anyone, but you\u2019d be in the clear in terms of \u201charboring a runaway\u201d and whatever other nonsense the mother wanted to spew. I hope you don\u2019t find yourself in this situation again, but keep that in mind for if you do.", "You should have called the cops yourself.", "Yea this is the answer. NTA. The PO probably lives in the city and would know the weather.", "This! Plus, cops work with CPS. NTA", "No they wouldn't.  Cops are busy dealing with real crimes. The mother just didnt want to drive in a storm to pick up her delinquent child", "Such a clusterfck - though 14 year olds aren't known for their amazing decision making skills.   I could see where 2 kids at that age would think spending the day together vs the friend sitting home alone (moms at work till late) would be a good idea.", "You cannot blame teenagers for not knowing it was going to be a bad snowstorm.  With all of the over blown weather reports now days, even a dusting of snow is a nameable storm.  Anyone who lives in the north pretty much disregards the weather people until we actually see the snow accumulation! Although the friend's mom is the biggest A H in this whole story since she let her daughter go out under the circumstances and then did nothing to bring her home besides offer threats.", "I took it as her meaning probation, not parole.  With probation she could easily have a curfew and other things.  The mom was the one who it seems like wanted the girl in trouble.  If I was the OP I would have done what you suggested and called the nonemergency line for advice regarding the weather and the child's safety in getting home.", "Brilliant idea", "Her mom gave her permission to come over", "The girl is 14. if the mother called and said these people kidnapped my child, they would go out to make sure things are fine. \"real crimes\" lmao. ok.", "Yeah, the stupid ideas teens have are breathtaking, but that doesn't make them less assholish. It's the age of fucking around and finding out. But there was a fully grown adult involved! They asked and the woman said \"sure.", "Her first ride has an accident due to the weather. Was that \"fake news\", too?", "Her mom's the AH.", "Not your fault at all.  Basically all you & your Mom knew was \"Sisters friend is coming over'.  Really the only responsibility is to make sure the girls are safe in the house, and not cooking meth in the basement.  It doesn't sound like anybody on your side (you OR your mom) said that you'd take on the responsibility of getting this kid back home.  Honestly if I were that Mom my first call would be to the parole officer, explain how bad the road conditions are and see if there was any way to let her daughter spend the night with you all.  I would hope that might be some leeway (especially since she's 14) when it comes to actual safety risks.", "But who gave permission on your end?", "Who on YOUR side, in your family, said it was okay? Especially given that she would need a ride home. Who took responsibility for getting her home?", "Filing a false kidnapping report is a real crime.", "yes the friend's Mom is the real AH.  Honestly if it weren't for the parole issue having a teenager get to a friend's safely before the storm hit to SPEND THE NIGHT with a family could be a good thing if the Mom was going to be working late (and potentially not being able to get home herself).\n\nMy husband said when he was around 9 he had a friend over spend the night, snow was normal for the area but a freak blizzard hit that night.  This little boy was with them for about 3 days until the roads got cleared.", "A lot of families don't require permission for bringing friends over. I never exactly know how many teenagers to expect when coming home. Though my kids and their friends do have more sense than those in this story.", "Just because a friend comes over does not mean that the friends family is responsible for a ride home. You want to allow your kid to go over a friends house in a snowstorm, you better be prepared to pick them up or let them spend the night. I\u2019m not risking my safety or a newborns to drive your kid home on your demand- who\u2019s your responsibility. This kids mom sounds toxic ass hell", "I think her ride there was supposed to be her ride home, but since they got into an accident they couldn\u2019t come back. At least that\u2019s how I interpreted it. So then OP\u2019s house was not supposed to be responsible for the rides at all. I think NTA on this one. She had a baby to look after too, so I completely understand not wanting to take the baby on the roads in that weather.", "Hmm. She\u2019s 19. She doesn\u2019t need to ask permission if things are okay.", "And? you initially said cops are too busy with real crimes to come find the child which was false. how would they know it's not a real crime when she calls? and if she called and it was fake, now she did a real crime which the cops would have to respond...\n\nSo which is it? Call her bluff. If she wants to call the cops over this then I would have let her. Mind you, this happened to a family member. The cops were called to pick up the \"missing\" family member and the took her home and told the mom not to call and do it again.", "If the sister gave promises to her friend, it falls to her family to fulfill those promises, whether the sister gathered permission from her family or not. The family seemed to know of the friends permission from her mother. If OP was not involved in the arrangements beforehand, she is NTA. OP's mother bears the ultimate responsibility and she handled it.", "All I knew was that she was going to be coming over and had a ride. Her ride was new drivers and I advised them not to leave also since they already crashed and the storm was getting worse. They ended up staying and not going back out on the roads thankfully", "OP is 19, not the friend."]}
