Losing a child is tremendously traumatizing and will affect any parent significantly. But he also shouldn't be comparing you to her, nor expecting you to be like her. \n\nHaving a talk with your dad may be a really good bonding experience. It's good you let him know you are not a replacement for his daughter, but maybe take some time to talk about who she was. She was an important part of your dad's life, and getting to know about her (and any other family members) will help you learn more about who your dad is as a person.", "NTA. You're a kid, and he said something that he really shouldn't have and I'm sure it was really hurtful. But I think your response has basically convinced him that you don't love him, or at least that you don't want him anywhere near you for the moment and so he's staying away to try to avoid making things worse. I'm betting, from my own experience as a parent, that he's crying because he realizes how badly he screwed up, and has no idea how to make it right.\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't think he sees you as a replacement for his first daughter. I think he's bewildered, because his first daughter never got to be the age that you are now, and so he has no experience with teenagers and felt helpless. \"X was never like that\" may have been said in the frustration of sheer confusion -- as in, \"I have never seen this kind of behavior before! How am I supposed to know what to do about it?!?\" \n\nYou'd be within your rights to just wait till he approaches you -- you're the kid, not the parent, and it's not your job to fix things like this. But if you can comfortably do anything to let him know that you still love him, even if it's as minimal as cracking him a faint smile if he catches your eye, it may help break the ice.", "This is probably above Reddit's paygrade. I'm gonna say NAH because this is likely a situation that requires family therapy.", "Wow, yeah this is not something to be dealing with on reddit, you both need therapy.", "NTA but you both should probably look at having some individual and family therapy.", "NTA- seems like both parties got heated and didn\u2019t think fully about what was being said before it came out. He absolutely shouldn\u2019t make comparisons between the two of you, you\u2019re your own person after all, but it\u2019s also something he might not have meant any harm by. Losing your own child is something I hope you never have to experience, but it\u2019s a wound that never seals shut. I understand him being upset also, but neither of you acted right tbh. I hope you both can talk things out now that it\u2019s cooled down", "NTA. His late daughter was never a teenager so they never got to the arguing stage. Who knows what she would have been like. All I can suggest is some family therapy. You\u2019re both clearly in pain and could use some professional guidance.", "Yeah I ain\u2019t touching this one lol", "NTA. This is a little bit of a tricky answer. As my adopted sister said it \u201cI feel special because he chose to be my dad, he didn\u2019t have to\u201d. He never got to go through that with her and probably holds onto that. Those are the times you need to warm up and hug him and remind him what he has.

You\u2019re not a replacement and comparing you to a 9 year old doesn\u2019t make sense. He walked into that argument on his own. As a parent myself, losing a child is never easy. I\u2019m not saying he doesn\u2019t thinks of you as a replacement because it appears so, but I also remember being compared to my sister which was annoying. I\u2019m not sure if that could be it too hard to say since I don\u2019t know anything about your dad.", "NTA as he needs to see you are your own person with the right to live your own path and life.

He should never have compared you, you shouldn\u2019t have retaliated - especially when the argument was over something so silly. \n\nGo find him now and explain, calmly, why what he said hurt you and then apologise for what you said.

I can understand how those comments might affect you. Communication is key! (:", "This is above Reddit's pay grade but I am going to say NAH , just a lot of pain,  on both sides. I strongly urge you to suggest that you & your dad book a few sessions with a therapist to help you work through this with a qualified,  neutral \"referee\".\n\nI wish you and your dad all the best and I don't pray often but I find myself praying hard for some genuine healing for the two of you.", "NTA and what he did really wasn\u2019t okay. He was trying to manipulate you into feeling bad by comparing you and making you the less appealing option. It was a low blow for him and you aren\u2019t his replacement daughter, you\u2019re entitled to be ungrateful every now and then, it\u2019s not your fault you grew up how you did. He chose to adopt you and take on that responsibility. Info? Do you go to therapy for your upbringing, does he go for his loss?", "NTA. \n\nDo you have the guts to go tell him this? \n\n\"We both know that what you said was really wrong,  and how I reacted wasn't kind. Can you apologize to me about comparing me to her? I'll not comment on who she was,  because obviously,  how could I know? And also obviously,  she was just as lucky as I am to have you as a father. \"\n\nApologize if you can,  too.\n\nThis is an inflection point in your relationship.  If he's ready to hear you,  you both could do some healing. \n\nI sure hope you're both in therapy (separately) because there's so much going in for each of you. \n\nGood luck!", "This is kind of an ESH thing. You both said hurtful things. Maybe try some family counselling.", "I want to say NAH, you were justified to be upset about being a replacement and your dad definitely needs therapy since he still seems to be grieving. Although given how he reacted by   \nsaying you were being ungrateful I'd say he's a bit of an AH. Maybe trying to bring up family therapy the next time you see him.", "ESH. Sorta. But not completely. \n\nIt's not great that your dad compared you to his other daughter. He doesn't know if his daughter would have been like as a teenager. Maybe she would have been a bigger, more difficult asshole than you could ever be. Maybe she would have been the sweetest, easiest teen ever to teenage. With sincere remorse, one knows.\n\nActing like you are a replacement until you do something he doesn't like is fucked up. He probably didn't mean it the way it came out. (but if he did, fuck thag.)\n\nHowever, you've probably not had a great life up until him. You were shuffled through the foster system and that comes with a ton of emotional baggage and feelings and trauma. I understand why you lashed out... But you don't know what the death of a child is like for someone. Using that as an argument point isn't the greatest thing you could have done. \n\nBut also, you're 15 and you were hurt by your father. 15 year olds do and say and think irrational things because your brain is still mush. He needs to be the parent of the child in front of him. \n\nYou both need therapy. Individually and family.", "NTA\n\nYou're still a child and you should not have to worry about matching his memories of his dead daughter.\n\nI feel very sad for him that he lost a child, and it seems like he hasn't quite worked through his grief properly. While it's not your responsibility to look after your dad, but rather the other way around, it might be in your interest to prompt him a bit by asking about her. Telling you about her could possibly make it clearer to him that you're two different people. \n\nThat said, while you're probably right that he's putting her on a pedestal and that she wasn't really that great, because no one is perfect, saying it the way you did was hurtful. And you ought to apologise for that.\n\nHe still owes you an apology, too, though, because comparing you to a dead girl, who he has likely sainted in his mind is very unfair to you. You're a teenager, expected to rebel to some degree. She never got to be a teenager, so he'll never have gone through that with her. He cannot expect you to never behave like a teen so as not to diverge from his image of her. He needs to realise this, and I'm not sure how you can achieve that, but as another commenter suggested, try telling him how much it hurts you to hear him say that the 9-year old he keeps  in his heart is this unattainable standard you'll be judged by.\n\nAnd maybe suggest that the two of you go to family therapy together. Losing a child is one of the roughest things a parent can ever experience, losing their parents and family, or just never having had one is one of the roughest things a child can experience.  Both of you should already be in therapy. If you aren't, please see if you can get your dad to set that in motion. \n\nI was leaning towards N A H, because I see where you're both coming from, and you're both hurting. But I ended with NTA, because even though your dad is understandably never going to not hurt about having lost a child, he's still the adult who chose to take in another child to raise as his own. It's his responsibility to be ready for that. It's a mild NTA, but still.\n\nI really hope you two can get the support you both need to heal your hurts and grow a healthier father-daughter bond.", "It's a complicated situation, i don't think any if you two is the asshole even if there's bas blood in between you at the moment.\n\nYou should try to sit together and talk it out in a reasonable way.\n\nYou've been hurt by what he said, he's also coming from a place of pain. It is not your fault, he knows it and probably regrets it. \n\nTake care, good luck with this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not at all fair to you to compare you to her,  and it's something he needs to deal with in order to be a better parent to you. However I suspect the issue is that instead of his grief for her lessening his love for you, it's more like his love for you is refreshing his grief for her, because he's realizing what she missed out on experiencing. You said some harsh truths. Perhaps your delivery was less than ideal, but you spoke the truth of how his remark made you feel. \n\nI think his grief is making it much harder for you both to communicate, which is further complicated by your understandable trauma and trust-issues from your past. The best I can say is that in my experience,  love finds a way. If you want to try opening communication back up (this silence is seriously unhealthy), try just talking to your Dad in a calm way. Tell him you understand he's grieving, and that you shouldn't have been so harsh, but you're afraid and you need him to be here for YOU. You both really need to see someone who can help you process your respective pasts and traumas, and perhaps a mediator who can help you both talk through the hurt.\n\n Sometime when you're both calmer, consider asking him to tell him about your older sister. It may help both of you to think of her that way. She was a huge part of his life, just like you are, and he loves you both. Let him share some positive stories with you, and maybe offer to start a yearly celebration of her favorite things on her birthday. At best, it will bond you both in so many ways. At worst it's an excuse to eat cake and go to a movie together.", "NTA. Saying his deceased daughter may not have been that great was a low blow, but he spoke first and worst.

I guarantee he feels terrible for hurting you, sometimes it is a little harder men to be the first one to express emotions. I realize you are the child in the situation, but you may need to be the one to initiate the healing. You both have some pretty deep scars that are influencing your reactions now.
