Losing a child is tremendously traumatizing and will affect any parent significantly. But he also shouldn't be comparing you to her, not expecting you to be like her. \n\nHaving a talk with your dad may be a really good binding experience. It's good you let him know you are not a replacement for his daughter, but maybe take some time to talk about who she was. She was an important part of your dad's life, and getting to know about her (and any other family members) will help you learn more about who your dad is as a person.", "NTA. You're a kid, and he said something that he really shouldn't have and I'm sure it was really hurtful. But I think your response has basically convinced him that you don't love him, or at least that you don't want him anywhere near you for the moment and so he's staying away to try to avoid making things worse. I'm betting, from my own experience as a parent, that he's crying because he realizes how badly he screwed up, and has no idea how to make it right.\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't think he sees you as a replacement for his first daughter. I think he's bewildered, because his first daughter never got to be the age that you are now, and so he has no experience with teenagers and felt helpless. \"X was never like that\" may have been said in the frustration of sheer confusion -- as in, \"I have never seen this kind of behavior before! How am I supposed to know what to do about it?!?\" \n\nYou'd be within your rights to just wait till he approaches you -- you're the kid, not the parent, and it's not your job to fix things like this. But if you can comfortably do anything to let him know that you still love him, even if it's as minimal as cracking him a faint smile if he catches your eye, it may help break the ice.", "This is probably above Reddit's paygrade. I'm gonna say NAH because this is likely a situation that requires family therapy.", "Wow, yeah this is not something to be dealing with on reddit, you both need therapy.", "NTA but you both should probably look at having some individual and family therapy.", "NTA- seems like both parties got heated and didn\u2019t think fully about what was being said before it came out. He absolutely shouldn\u2019t make comparisons between the two of you, you\u2019re your own person after all, but it\u2019s also something he might not have meant any harm by. Losing your own child is something I hope you never have to experience, but it\u2019s a wound that never seals shut. I understand him being upset also, but neither of you acted right tbh. I hope you both can talk things out now that it\u2019s cooled down", "NTA. His late daughter was never a teenager so they never got to the arguing stage. Who knows what she would have been like. All I can suggest is some family therapy. You\u2019re both clearly in pain and could use some professional guidance.", "Yeah I ain\u2019t touching this one lol", "NTA. This is a little bit of a tricky answer. As my adopted sister said it \u201cI feel special because he chose to be my dad, he didn\u2019t have to\u201d. He never got to go through that with her and probably holds onto that. Those are the times you need to warm up and hug him and remind him what he has.

You\u2019re not a replacement and comparing you to a 9 year old doesn\u2019t make sense. He walked into that argument on his own. As a parent myself, losing a child is never easy. I\u2019m not saying he doesn\u2019t thinks of you as a replacement because it appears so, but I also remember being compared to my sister which was annoying. I\u2019m not sure if that could be it too hard to say since I don\u2019t know anything about your dad.", "NTA as he needs to see you are your own person with the right to live your own path and life.

He should never have compared you, you shouldn\u2019t have retaliated - especially when the argument was over something so silly. \n\nGo find him now and explain, calmly, why what he said hurt you and then apologise for what you said.

I can understand how those comments might affect you. Communication is key! (:", "This is above Reddit's pay grade but I am going to say NAH , just a lot of pain,  on both sides. I strongly urge you to suggest that you & your dad book a few sessions with a therapist to help you work through this with a qualified,  neutral \"referee\".\n\nI wish you and your dad all the best and I don't pray often but I find myself praying hard for some genuine healing for the two of you.", "NTA and what he did really wasn\u2019t okay. He was trying to manipulate you into feeling bad by comparing you and making you the less appealing option. It was a low blow for him and you aren\u2019t his replacement daughter, you\u2019re entitled to be ungrateful every now and then, it\u2019s not your fault you grew up how you did. He chose to adopt you and take on that responsibility. Info? Do you go to therapy for your upbringing, does he go for his loss?", "NTA. \n\nDo you have the guts to go tell him this? \n\n\"We both know that what you said was really wrong,  and how I reacted wasn't kind. Can you apologize to me about comparing me to her? I'll not comment on who she was,  because obviously,  how could I know? And also obviously,  she was just as lucky as I am to have you as a father. \"\n\nApologize if you can,  too.\n\nThis is an inflection point in your relationship.  If he's ready to hear you,  you both could do some healing. \n\nI sure hope you're both in therapy (separately) because there's so much going in for each of you. \n\nGood luck!", "This is kind of an ESH thing. You both said hurtful things. Maybe try some family counselling.", "I want to say NAH, you were justified to be upset about being a replacement and your dad definitely needs therapy since he still seems to be grieving. Although given how he reacted by   \nsaying you were being ungrateful I'd say he's a bit of an AH. Maybe trying to bring up family therapy the next time you see him.", "ESH. Sorta. But not completely. \n\nIt's not great that your dad compared you to his other daughter. He doesn't know if his daughter would have been like as a teenager. Maybe she would have been a bigger, more difficult asshole than you could ever be. Maybe she would have been the sweetest, easiest teen ever to teenage. With sincere remorse, one knows.\n\nActing like you are a replacement until you do something he doesn't like is fucked up. He probably didn't mean it the way it came out. (but if he did, fuck thag.)\n\nHowever, you've probably not had a great life up until him. You were shuffled through the foster system and that comes with a ton of emotional baggage and feelings and trauma. I understand why you lashed out... But you don't know what the death of a child is like for someone. Using that as an argument point isn't the greatest thing you could have done. \n\nBut also, you're 15 and you were hurt by your father. 15 year olds do and say and think irrational things because your brain is still mush. He needs to be the parent of the child in front of him. \n\nYou both need therapy. Individually and family.", "NTA\n\nYou're still a child and you should not have to worry about matching his memories of his dead daughter.\n\nI feel very sad for him that he lost a child, and it seems like he hasn't quite worked through his grief properly. While it's not your responsibility to look after your dad, but rather the other way around, it might be in your interest to prompt him a bit by asking about her. Telling you about her could possibly make it clearer to him that you're two different people. \n\nThat said, while you're probably right that he's putting her on a pedestal and that she wasn't really that great, because no one is perfect, saying it the way you did was hurtful. And you ought to apologise for that.\n\nHe still owes you an apology, too, though, because comparing you to a dead girl, who he has likely sainted in his mind is very unfair to you. You're a teenager, expected to rebel to some degree. She never got to be a teenager, so he'll never have gone through that with her. He cannot expect you to never behave like a teen so as not to diverge from his image of her. He needs to realise this, and I'm not sure how you can achieve that, but as another commenter suggested, try telling him how much it hurts you to hear him say that the 9-year old he keeps  in his heart is this unattainable standard you'll be judged by.\n\nAnd maybe suggest that the two of you go to family therapy together. Losing a child is one of the roughest things a parent can ever experience, losing their parents and family, or just never having had one is one of the roughest things a child can experience.  Both of you should already be in therapy. If you aren't, please see if you can get your dad to set that in motion. \n\nI was leaning towards N A H, because I see where you're both coming from, and you're both hurting. But I ended with NTA, because even though your dad is understandably never going to not hurt about having lost a child, he's still the adult who chose to take in another child to raise as his own. It's his responsibility to be ready for that. It's a mild NTA, but still.\n\nI really hope you two can get the support you both need to heal your hurts and grow a healthier father-daughter bond.", "It's a complicated situation, i don't think any if you two is the asshole even if there's bas blood in between you at the moment.\n\nYou should try to sit together and talk it out in a reasonable way.\n\nYou've been hurt by what he said, he's also coming from a place of pain. It is not your fault, he knows it and probably regrets it. \n\nTake care, good luck with this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not at all fair to you to compare you to her,  and it's something he needs to deal with in order to be a better parent to you. However I suspect the issue is that instead of his grief for her lessening his love for you, it's more like his love for you is refreshing his grief for her, because he's realizing what she missed out on experiencing. You said some harsh truths. Perhaps your delivery was less than ideal, but you spoke the truth of how his remark made you feel. \n\nI think his grief is making it much harder for you both to communicate, which is further complicated by your understandable trauma and trust-issues from your past. The best I can say is that in my experience,  love finds a way. If you want to try opening communication back up (this silence is seriously unhealthy), try just talking to your Dad in a calm way. Tell him you understand he's grieving, and that you shouldn't have been so harsh, but you're afraid and you need him to be here for YOU. You both really need to see someone who can help you process your respective pasts and traumas, and perhaps a mediator who can help you both talk through the hurt.\n\n Sometime when you're both calmer, consider asking him to tell him about your older sister. It may help both of you to think of her that way. She was a huge part of his life, just like you are, and he loves you both. Let him share some positive stories with you, and maybe offer to start a yearly celebration of her favorite things on her birthday. At best, it will bond you both in so many ways. At worst it's an excuse to eat cake and go to a movie together.", "NTA. Saying his deceased daughter may not have been that great was a low blow, but he spoke first and worst.

He needs grief therapy, but I think he also needs reassurance that despite this fight you still love and appreciate him.\n\nThis is a deeply painful issue, and as much as you have a right to be upset, I think this is a situation that with a few steps back for both parties, and therapy, it could bring your dad some very necessary healing and help improve your relationship with him.", "NTA. That was a low blow and comparing a 15yo to a 9yo is crazy.", "It sounds like you both said some things in the heat of the moment. It happens. But your situation is a little more unique because you were adopted and he\u2019s lost a child\u2014you\u2019ve both suffered tough losses, though different. Also, you\u2019re a teen and he\u2019s never parented a teen\u2026.it\u2019s not always easy and it\u2019s natural you two butt heads. Therapy together may be beneficial. \n\nA piece of advice I give my young adult children if they feel a situation escalating is to simply say \u201cpause\u201d as an indicator to all involved that some space and time need to take precedence to avoid responding emotionally instead of rationally. It doesn\u2019t mean avoid the problem\u2014just take a time out to find a way to communicate more effectively when everyone is calm. \n\nWhen my kids were younger, to teach them that words matter, I purposely (and safely) broke a plate and asked them to put it back together. They thought I was nuts but they did it. The pieces fit, but there were lines and cracks all over. They were able to see this representation and better understand how words hurt. We can mend things, but the scars remain. Of course, I\u2019m not suggesting you start smashing plates, but the two of you could benefit by showing each other a safe representation of how your words have hurt each other and then grow together.", "NTA. He is for comparing his two children, which you should Never do, and certainly Not when one of them is dead and only seen in the golden light of memory.\n\nHe also shouldn\u2019t have been cleared for adoption, sorry op but it\u2019s true, when he wasn\u2019t in a mental space to keep the living and the dead separated.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. It\u2019s never a child\u2019s responsibility to fulfill the emotional need of an adult. Sounds like dad wanted to fulfill the need of having a child because his older one passed. Which in of itself is tragic. Even if that wasn\u2019t the case, it\u2019s never okay to compare kids (or anyone truthfully, all people of different).", "Nta", "Go apologize ...your room was messy and caused the fight. He is allowed to have feelings and you hurt him", "NAH, but your dad shouldn't have said what he did. I can't in good conscious call a man in grief who adopted a child in need an \"asshole\", but he was wrong in what he said. For what it's worth, I don't think you are a replacement for his first daughter. He didn't run out and adopt another kid - he adopted you many years after the passing of his first child. If I may, I think that his love for you is true and pure - he just screwed up by comparing the two of you. (In his head, he was probably thinking more along the lines of \"My first kid was so different - am I screwing up this one?\", but it came out bitter from grief).", "NTA.\n\nIt's pretty mean of him to hold over your head that he saved your life. He can't expect you to do everything he wants just because he \"saved\" you from foster care.\n\nSorry you have to feel like you're not good enough. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. If he can afford to, maybe you could ask him to go to family therapy with you. That might help so both of you can get your feelings off your chest.", "Let me get this straight, you are calling yourself your replacement for his late daughter to the point In which you have Created these false pretenses of the current situation to that it causes a serious rift or problem in the current situation..? Has he ever once outright told you these things or directly done something to make you feel second hand?? \n\n\nYeah I'm gonna go with HUGE YTA, communication is key bro and the sooner you find this out the better. \n\nHow long have you felt this way BEFORE you snapped on your adoptive father, and again how many times have you confronted them about your feelings before snapping on them? \n\nHuge YTA, I am 21 turning 22 this year and would never do anything for a loving father such as you are describing, not everyone is dealt a fair in life clearly but that does not mean you need to just throw out the cards you are dealt because you don't like them? I understand you are super young but hopefully this is a learning and growing moment in your life, please do not grow up to be another case of a person who constantly is victimizing themselves over trivial things. There is a huge difference between being spoiled and being grateful, please learn the fine line when you still have the chance.", "**NAH** \n\nYou are not a replacement for his dead daughter I bet he loves you. His only frame of reference to parenting is his daughter who died and he said something incredibly stupid. \n\nHe should not have said that you should not have reacted like that. You both need therapy to stop stupid arguments spilling over into deep seeted feelings of loss and rejection.", "Nta", "NAH. And when people have more than one kid - they quite often compare them. I mean people are different, and one kid is more organized, another kid is more academic but messier etc. It doesn't mean they love them any less. You are not replacement, you are his second daughter.", "NAH\n\nI don\u2019t think he meant to compare/replace, but get that topic hits a nerve for you.\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019m sure it hit a nerve when you took his comment that way - and he realized he hurt you that much.\n\nMaybe time for a truce - sounds like you both love and need eachother, now, and in the future. This is part of being human, ups and downs, you\u2019ll be fine - this too shall pass.", "You retaliation was abit OTT. What he said doesnt imply you are a replacement, thats you projecting. \n\nIf she was still alive and living out the house as she is so much older, he'd still have said the same thing.\n\nAnd even if she wasnt like this - maybe its the truth - its still not  him saying you are a replacement.  Its just factual.\n\nYou are projecting how you feel on him. And  you know what you also have to accept he had a daughter before you and maybe he did love her more. That is allowed.  It doesnt mean he doesnt love you - this is not black and white. He could have 5 kids and feel more about the eldest. \n\nYou need to work on your self esteem - you are you - and  you are enough for anyone and you dont need to change. But allow him to have his loss for his eldest.", "NTA or NAH not sure which. Sorry about dead daughter for him but she never made it to teenager. Teenagers are not like single digit kids. Can you give him a hug and suggest some family therapy?", "I'm gonna say just go hug Dad. Stop arguing and know that he loves you.", "It requires family therapy, yes, but I don't think that you need a degree in medicine to know that a fifteen year old who has lashed out over being guilted about the fact that she's adopted isn't an asshole, or that it's an asshole move to say \"I saved your life by adopting you, so I should get to say whatever I like to you.\" \n\nIt would be an asshole move if he was her biological father, except then the line would be \"I feed, clothe, and house you, so you have to deal with however I want to talk to you.\" This *is* different, yes, but not in a way that makes him not an asshole.", "Tbh, parents often compare their kids. Unless there is unhealthy dynamic about favoring one child over others, it is pretty common.", "get your \u201creal medical help\u201d from real medical professionals", "Go find him now and explain, calmly, why what he said hurt you and then apologise for what you said.", "But my armchair came with a surtiphikayshun and everything!", "No, but they can take the opinions into consideration, and different opinions can really help you make a choice, they helped me", "Which is what redditors push posters to do and that is what I was implying", "I'm a real medical professional. Real medical professionals know that they cannot give personalised advice over social media without their license being at risk. (Obv there is telemedicine, but we all know that is not it).", "The only medical advice you should be taking from reddit is \"ask your doctor if this is \\[x\\]\" or \"SEE YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT NOW IMMEDIATELY.\" Absolutely no one on here is licensed to practice medicine on this forum.", "No disagreement there, I just see it often enough to wanted to remark that it happens.", "Love a good false equivalence"]}
