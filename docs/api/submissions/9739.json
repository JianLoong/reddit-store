I'd agree that if you did do this, you should've waited to tell him till you knew him well.", "I mean, if you're gonna feel guilty about it then don't meet people online in real life. It's just such a paradox that you want to both be able to meet people online anonymously but also run background checks on them to meet them in real life, but then feel guilty about doing it and then confess the entire thing. It's really creepy and if someone did that to me, I would probably feel really icked out, like how you'd feel if you had a stalker who tried to learn too much about you.", "I think telling him was a good thing and I would immediately trust the other much more after such a confession.", "That's a leap, his reaction showed he didn't want his kink connected to his professional life (op mentions she found him on LinkedIn) that seems reasonable.\n\nNAH", "Exactly because of his reaction. He could have turned violent.", "and who are you? just wondering so I don't match with you somewhere.\n\nJesus I hate the whole if you don't have anything to hide then you don't have anything to worry about excuse. I work in Tech security and just like my own privacy to begin with.\n\nBecause I don't care who you are, someone always has something to hide, and there is an absolute crapload that is incorrect about people on the internet. I know I have deeply searched myself and there's a lot about me, i.e people I am supposedly acquainted with, places I supposedly lived, and even things about stuff supposedly done in college that are completely wrong.\n\nFriend of mine was accused of burglary in a local newspaper ( and on their website). but guess what, the guy that did it had the same name except they never posted the middle initial which was different. Make a difference? yea a lot. To someone who knew/saw on facebook/somewhere that they grew up in that town and just randomly searching names, how would they know it wasn't the correct person?", "Plot twist. The guy you hired is not a PI. He is a 'Hitch' (watch the movie with that name). Your husband hired the guy, and the guy set himself up for you to contact him as a PI. So he can get you to trust him, and then he used that trust to set you and your husband up.", "Exactly this. Your poor sister, that\u2019s absolutely terrible.", "How is OP the asshole for not trusting a complete stranger..?\n\nI mean, \\*everyone\\* should do background checks before going on dates with strangers. Its just common sense, and if you dont then you run the risk of being hurt.", "It is absolutely not a violation of trust.", "Don't be ridiculous... It's only common sense to check out your potential date for any red flags especially whennyou knew each other on a kink website.", "It'd definitely not have told him. But I disagree it's a violation of trust, their only relationship prior was online and people can present a completely distorted version of themselves online. However I completely agree his reaction was not the best.", "I would not meet up with someone if I could not:\n1. Verify their identify (first name / last name) \n2. Provide id and photo to my sister before meeting them\n\nIdeally I could ensure the info they told me aligns with what the posted (interests, job, etc)", "When you tell them matters. They met on a kink site. That can already be kind of hairy. But if you meet in person and on your first date, they tell you they looked you up, it would be really offputting. Kinks are already a forbidden thing in many places. So many people need to keep quiet about them because no one around them gets it. Then to be told someone looked them up on top of that would be the cherry on top. Being on a kink site already carries the risk of being found and judged. You don't need people you share something so intimate with to act suspicious of you as well.", "the interaction was online", "Exactly. Someone with nothing to hide wouldn't care. In fact, since you met on a kink site I think they'd be even more understanding depending on what the kink is. Dodged a bullet.", "Just because someone doesn't want to be looked up doesn't mean they have something to hide.", "Yes she was incredibly courageous she went straight to the police who took her to the hospital did the whole collect evidence thing. Which must have been horrible but he went to jail for 6 years.", "They had talked for months though so while it was a first face to face meeting it wasn't really the first meeting.", "Reread my comment, since I say it quite clearly.", "I disagree. We both have our opinions on that.", "OP crosschecked LinkedIn, Google News and checked for criminal record, all of which is public information. They didn't hire a private investigator.", "Safer than up close, but still dangerous.", "It's not about if he had something to hide. I never said that. It's about him understanding that women have to constantly be aware of whether or not we're safe. She didn't do that for fun, she did it for her safety. If he can't understand that, then OP is better off.", "I've found that people I've met online before are on the sex offender registry. Is that not a valuable piece of information for me to have? Most people would not disclose this before meeting. I think checking is not only appropriate, but the wise thing to do in this scenario.", "How can you trust someone you\u2019ve never met? That sounds ridiculously naive and could put you in very unsafe situations.", "I don't think I would, if it was under these circumstances and happened before an initial meet-up. At that stage you're taking a lot on faith, and looking up publicly available information isn't really a violation of my privacy. \n\nIn fact I think I'd be more offended if it happened after we'd been seeing each other a while or like if it was done by a family member of the person I'm dating. It's one thing to not immediately trust a complete stranger, especially one you're planning to let tie you up/etc. Vetting makes perfect sense in a situation where you're making yourself more vulnerable than you would be on a normal date. It'd be more upsetting if it was something that happened after trust had already been long since established.", ">So if someone stalked all the information about you online they could find and told you about it, you would have zero  negative reaction to that? In highly doubt it.\n\nI guess it what somewhat depend on why they were/why they were looking me up, but if they had a reasonable reason no I wouldn't mind.\n\nIf this was a potential partner, a potential employer, or even just another parent who looked me up online before having their kids over at my home, I'd be fine with that? Why would I be upset? I don't consider public information online \"stalking\" the way I would someone following me around in real life.\n\nMaybe my view is skewed beacuse I work with children and I literally have had a full background check + finger printing for every single job I've ever had except one, but it just seems smart. I also realize that anything I post online using my name is public and people can see it forever? Every potential date, friend, employer, kid's friend's parent, etc. That's how the internet works?", "Yeah that's totally fair. I could understand why someone would flip out if another person went background checking, especially someone who prefers to keep their kinky secret life and their real life seperate.", "Isn\u2019t that worse though? Are you really that comfortable with that easy an online footprint? That just seems too easy to abuse.", "> It is extremely unwise to trust a random stranger from the internet\n\nThat's why I don't trust your comment", "> How can you trust someone you\u2019ve never met?\n\nThrough texting. If you don't trust em from text conversations, probably best to not meet them in person", "My point was that he didn't. Two sentences later I said she took the choice away from him.", "Oh, fancy meeting you here Mr. President, how was the play?", ">Some people do disclose personal information when they\u2019re organising a meet up.\n\nAnd they do that because \"trust\" and not because it's required if you want to meet up for kinky sex? Considering she found his last name on LinkedIn, dude didn't even trust her with something you tell a bunch of people every single day. But, sure, his undying trust in her was violated.", "The play was a killer.", "I don\u2019t know about you. But in my experience the least I\u2019ve demanded from someone before I\u2019ve met them for bdsm play is their name and age, especially if we originally met anon. \n\nThe fact you have your back up so much about this has me questioning your background, history and moral compass. \n\nIt\u2019s BDSM \nIf OP is submissive there\u2019s a range of things they\u2019re submitting to, which is risky play. With someone dangerous it\u2019s asking for trouble. \nIf OP is Dominant, they\u2019re still at risk. Due to potential accusations. \nPeople on both sides of the spectrum vet each other. \nThis guy is talking about his dirty sexual needs and desires, and he\u2019s concerned about a police check? \n\nYou come across very na\u00efve and inexperienced, especially with BDSM. You\u2019re only thinking about the police check, not the fact that OP was planning to participate in risky sexual acts with a strange man she\u2019s met anonymously and did the safe thing of vetting the stranger with no references. \n\nI feel you\u2019d be the one blaming OP if they posted about this later being a negative meet. Stating they should have vetted this guy first\u2026", "What are you even on about?!\n\n>The fact you have your back up so much about this has me questioning your background, history and moral compass.\n\nBecause I don't think giving someone your name, age, and city is the utmost trust you can bestow upon a human?\n\nThe rest...I don't even know what that's about, why you think it matters, or what it has to do with anything I said. Did you just want to tell me you are into BDSM or something? Do you want a cookie?", "People into BDSM tend to be risk aware and consent and negotiation focused.  \n\nBut meeting any stranger off the internet is inherently risky, whatever the stated intent (kink, dating, buy & sell, freecycle)\n\nYou have your risk profile. Other people have their own.\n\nYou are projecting your risk profile onto others.\n\nNot wanting a stranger to have enough personal information about you to run a background check is perfectly normal and doesn't indicate any lack of morals.  People find the balance between safety and security in their own ways. \n\nI often met people who don't know anything about me except my SM handles and the content on them.  It amazes me how many are willing to have me go to their home for a first meet. I mean,  if I had ill intent, I'm going to be in a position to do some damage to their lives.  They don't know if I'm catfishing, data mining to commit ID theft, a PI investigating them, an axe murderer, etc.\n\nI'd still balk at anyone demanding enough personal data to run background checks. Both parties deserve a level of privacy while trust is gradually built over time imo. (Busy public place & safe calls are my risk mitigations YMMV)"]}
