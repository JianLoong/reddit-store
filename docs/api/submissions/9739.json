So you can't find anything on fb and LinkedIn. Would you still meet them?\n\nI get that online dating for women can be scary. I can also see how he'd be offended. I'd agree that if you did do this, you should've waited to tell him till you knew him well.", "I mean, if you're gonna feel guilty about it then don't meet people online in real life. It's just such a paradox that you want to both be able to meet people online anonymously but also run background checks on them to meet them in real life, but then feel guilty about doing it and then confess the entire thing. It's really creepy and if someone did that to me, I would probably feel really icked out, like how you'd feel if you had a stalker who tried to learn too much about you.", "I think telling him was a good thing and I would immediately trust the other much more after such a confession.", "That's a leap, his reaction showed he didn't want his kink connected to his professional life (op mentions she found him on LinkedIn) that seems reasonable.\n\nNAH", "Exactly because of his reaction.

The guy you hired is not a PI. He is a 'Hitch' (watch the movie with that name). Your husband hired the guy, and the guy set himself up for you to contact him as a PI.

Your poor sister, that\u2019s absolutely terrible.", "How is OP the asshole for not trusting a complete stranger..?\n\nI mean, \\*everyone\\* should do background checks before going on dates with strangers. Its just common sense, and if you dont then you run the risk of being hurt.", "It is absolutely not a violation of trust.", "Don't be ridiculous... It's only common sense to check out your potential date for any red flags especially whennyou knew each other on a kink website.", "It'd definitely not have told him.

They met on a kink site. That can already be kind of hairy. But if you meet in person and on your first date, they tell you they looked you up, it would be really offputting. Kinks are already a forbidden thing in many places. So many people need to keep quiet about them because no one around them gets it. Then to be told someone looked them up on top of that would be the cherry on top. Being on a kink site already carries the risk of being found and judged. You don't need people you share something so intimate with to act suspicious of you as well.", "the interaction was online", "Exactly. Someone with nothing to hide wouldn't care.

That sounds ridiculously naive and could put you in very unsafe situations.", "I don't think I would, if it was under these circumstances and happened before an initial meet-up. At that stage you're taking a lot on faith, and looking up publicly available information isn't really a violation of my privacy. \n\nIn fact I think I'd be more offended if it happened after we'd been seeing each other a while or like if it was done by a family member of the person I'm dating. It's one thing to not immediately trust a complete stranger, especially one you're planning to let tie you up/etc. Vetting makes perfect sense in a situation where you're making yourself more vulnerable than you would be on a normal date.

Why would I be upset? I don't consider public information online \"stalking\" the way I would someone following me around in real life.\n\nMaybe my view is skewed beacuse I work with children and I literally have had a full background check + finger printing for every single job I've ever had except one, but it just seems smart.

Every potential date, friend, employer, kid's friend's parent, etc. That's how the internet works?", "Yeah that's totally fair.

Other people have their own.\n\nYou are projecting your risk profile onto others.\n\nNot wanting a stranger to have enough personal information about you to run a background check is perfectly normal and doesn't indicate any lack of morals.  People find the balance between safety and security in their own ways. \n\nI often met people who don't know anything about me except my SM handles and the content on them.  It amazes me how many are willing to have me go to their home for a first meet. I mean,  if I had ill intent, I'm going to be in a position to do some damage to their lives.  They don't know if I'm catfishing, data mining to commit ID theft, a PI investigating them, an axe murderer, etc.\n\nI'd still balk at anyone demanding enough personal data to run background checks. Both parties deserve a level of privacy while trust is gradually built over time imo.

You're good OP.", "NTA. You have every right to do that. And contrary to the messaging on here that you shouldn\u2019t have told him I sternly disagree. Telling him is fair to you both, him ending things means you are incompatible.

I can see both sides and both seem entirely reasonable to me. Without getting into the details too much, the fact is that yes, it can be seen as a bit creepy to stalk ALL available public information about someone, sure. At the same time, there are inherent risks to women that aren't as severe in the least for a man. It is as reasonable for you to perform a check as it is for another to be put off by you doing that. \n\nBut seriously, everyone has a little \"stalk\" when they're talking to someone online. It's just not normally mentioned haha.", "NTA that you looked him up, I looked up a friends date and he had a domestic abuse case pending, and another guy she was dating was married lol.

Even worse than prying is the fact they feel so ok that they're comfortable mentioning it on the first date. \n\nAs for safety, it's better ensured in old fashioned ways.

While there has always been a respect for anonymity within the kink community (I do know personally)  there is a genuine need to protect yourself when online dating,  this person was not just chatting they were about to meet, at this point they should be checking for thier own safty, honestly if a person I was planning on meeting didn't want to share more some personal info that would be a concern especially if planing on involving kinks.  It would be very different if they had done this sort of searches after a first chat, bit this was months of chatting and preparing for a real life meeting.", "Checking if someone has criminal charges is not a publicly available information.
