If that isn't good enough of an assurance for you, then you shouldn't be using an anonymous service like this in the first place.", "NTA considering the type of dating site it is. That requires a far higher level of trust so can't really apply the usual dating logic.", "I didn't know there was a dating app for people with kinks. O.o I mean I have my Dom (I'm new though) an loyal to him so not interested but still learning things lol.\n\nAll honesty though look a person up. I have, saved me in the past from making poor decision.", "Especially in kink, there's no reason not to do a background check when there is so information online. \nNTA", "Nta but don't tell people this until ur like married and it'll be funny.", "NTA. It was online, after all. Alot of predator's use online dating to get at people and it's good to make sure people don't have a history. If it was in person and you had already known them for awhile, different story, maybe, but I still don't see a problem. Background checks are generally very formal, all you'd find is criminal records and maybe their social medias. All the stuff is gonna be already public.", "NTA, absolutely clear cut.\n\nWhat you did should be standard practice in this day and age. You checked publicly available information for any red flags, if anything I'd see that as a responsible action rather than a violation of trust.  The fact he responded like he did raises a bigger question in my mind and you likely avoided a potential problem later down the line.\n\nMeeting for the first time is a huge step, and protecting yourself is never an issue.", "NTA\n\nI can see why he felt uncomfortable about it. But he should realise that someone looking out for their safety is more important than avoiding his discomfort under these circumstances.\n\nThis should have been a \"oh cringe, that makes me feel awkward. But I get it\" situation.", "NTA most of those things are readily available some for a modest fee. Gotta be safe and gotta respect the consequences.", "NTA. My wife ran me through the actual cop database because she works for the PD\u2026 and so did my ex\u2019s father. It is what it is.", "He probably left because he's hiding something.", "Eh, I've had women run checks on me before a date. Maybe I'm a little different, but I'm okay with it, given how many problem men they've probably had before. I say NTA.", "NTA- I mean, he probably should know that his anonymity isn\u2019t really.\nIt\u2019s your safety and you weren\u2019t doing it to publish his activities or stalk him so he can get over it, and maybe make those connections harder to sus out going forward", "NTA. I'd be weirded out if someone investigated me but I understand it's for your safety. Like everyone said just keep that info to yourself.", "NTA.  You're trying to be safe and that's perfectly fine.  Just don't tell them lol", "NTA.\nNo one wants to end up in a basement somewhere. I would love to find the \"Most wanted\" poster BEFORE the date!!", "NTA. What\u2019s the name of the criminal database?", "NTA.   \nI\u2019d totally do a range of online searches (probably not pay for a background check) and if anything unusual came up I\u2019d totally take that into account, before meeting up with someone from an online community when I had the potential to get into kink or sex with them. For sure.   \nToo many weirdos out there. Particularly in the kink communities where there\u2019s a lot of guys with very odd opinions on a wiiide range of stuff. I\u2019d be looking for what they say online where, and whether I like their attitudes before I meet them for sure.", "NTA, but is het legal to look someone up in a legal database or is that also public? Otherwise that might have been a step to far?", "Why would anyone be surprised by this? With this level of technology, I expect it. Why wouldn't you google someone given the chance?\n\nAlso, true crime documentaries instill the fear that just about anyone can kill or be killed, so the extra level of safety is a must.", "NTA...just keep this to yourself next time.\n\nMy friend is an ex-cop who is married to a working cop and guess what our friends group do all the time when we date someone new? \n\n...Yup, exactly.", "One night my ex-husband was stopped for speeding, suddenly he was arrested and extradited to another state. That night, I found out he was on parole after serving 13 yrs in prison for several violent crimes, cut off his ankle monitor and left the state. \n\nWhen we met, he told me that he had one dui from his early days. His family told me the same story. \nBack then everything was not available at the touch of a button. Best believe, this is why I now run checks on every single damn person that wants to be centered in mine and my son\u2019s life. I\u2019m not risking our lives for anyone or anything. No one should. \n\nObviously, NTA but be grateful for that \ud83d\udea9 he\u2019s throwing out there and move on. \n\nBut maybe keep that info to yourself next time. There\u2019s no reason to tell everyone every thing. Had he had an even worse reaction, he could have done something he couldn\u2019t take back.", "NTA but pretty silly to tell him.", "NTA", "YTA.\nIf you are _that_ neurotic, or what have you, don't engage with people for the purpose of meeting up.", "This is complete crazy stalker material honestly. Like I get wanting to be safe and know who you are meeting. But to go to this extent for someone you're meeting for the first time? I mean if someone told me they did all that for what was either a single first date or hookup I would immediately nope my way out of any interaction with them.", "I hired someone to check on a man I was talking to and was very interested in. This was back in the 90\u2019s and we met on IRC. When they came back and said it was the easiest case they ever had, I booked a plane ticket to meet him and never returned home. We married later that year. He knew I hired someone and he had nothing to hide.\n\nBecause of that, it makes me think the guy you looked into had something to hide and you just hadn\u2019t found it. Personally, I think you dodged a bullet. NTA.", "Yikes, I'd heard about that one but hadn't seen the update. Thanks for the link.", "Actually no.... It's actually good practice, regardless of gender or sexual orientations, to ask around to see if a person is OK. It saves a lot of drama and headaches. Also it's for safety reasons.\n\nPeople look up their crush's (or exes) social media like all the time. How's this different?", ">I also think that if the sexes were reversed, the judgements would be 100% different.\n\nThat's because men are FAR more dangerous to women than women are to men.", "Forget this comment, you do not look crazy for looking after yourself and let it be known.\n\nAny guy that is not okay with a woman protecting herself is not worth dating\n\nNTA", "In my opinion, it's for the best. I wouldn't want to be with someone who couldn't be understanding of me prioritizing my safety. You wanted to make sure that you weren't in danger. That doesn't make you crazy.", "How would you feel if it happened to you?", "I told my now husband I'd looked him up, but only after we'd been together a few months. I also told him I'd researched a handful of guys from dating apps before he and I met and actually found some sketchy stuff out... he knew me and liked me enough by then to already know I wasn't crazy, and he was fine with it. Plus he knew what women potentially have to deal with and that it's a safety thing.", "Yeah that is a major red flag, as a very extreme mafia player a dead giveaway on if someone is untrustworthy is if they react really bad to you checking up on them. If you talk to someone about checking their criminal records and they feel offended by that, there's no reason to be upset by a background check unless you're hiding something or just have real bad trust issues.\n\nYou may have dodged a huge bullet, OP", "That's all you said? It's a little weird that he ended things when you only told him that you just wanted to make sure you were safe. It seems like a red flag, honestly.", "If he reacted bad to this line if speech only leaves me thinking you didn't look hard enough \ud83d\ude02", "I knew someone who does background checks on her potential boyfriends. She asked her friends about him and what he's like. She avoided a lot of drama that way.\n\nIt's smart to do it because you never know what kind of person you are going to form a romantic relationship with. Just don't let them know until you know them better and they're fine with it.", ">His response to you protecting yourself was to get mad\n\nWhere do you get mad? He was upset - because the other side of the coin is him feeling violated. It's not exactly that OP was foolish to to the background check, far from it, but it feels rather violating to know someone found a bunch of details from you from stalking your socials and then fully running a background check on you. Hell, he ended things, when the background came back presumably clean. If he was planning anything nefarious, why not just be happy that she's been lulled into a false sense of security and proceed with the date?", "Not only that, within the kink community it is heavily advised to vet new partners/interests. Safety is a priority when it comes to sex but kinksters need a further layer of concern due to the extreme ways we play. \n\nThere can be a fine like between BDSM and abuse. OP was trying to safely vet someone however I think they\u2019re on the wrong feed for this kind of question. \n\nFetlife would be a better site or bdsm based feed. Subs everywhere would commend her for her safe thinking, however would also tell her not to feel guilt, shame or concern towards her need for safety given the number of people in the bdsm scene who have faced negative events due to lack of vetting.", "I haven\u2019t experienced that version, but yes, I could see that being the case.", "In the bdsm scene we generally do the same, however op has stated it was an anon app geared towards kinky people. They wanted to meet and op wanted to ensure safety :) \nI\u2019m sure if OP knew they could verify this person with others first they would have taken such a route! Most kinky folks do! \n\nBut I\u2019m just assuming on OPs behalf also! \nI honestly would do the same if I could in my country for bdsm players I can\u2019t properly vet. For example new players with lack of history in the local scene!", "It is extremely unwise to trust a random stranger from the internet, especially someone you met on a kink dating site", "> Deciding to let someone connect that part of you to your public life is a particular act of trust that one wants to have some control over. \n\nWhy do you think he \"decided to let\" her do anything? I doubt he gave her his LinkedIn, she found that out behind his back.", "I wouldn't. It seems like a good thing to want to do a little research before you go out with someone. If their rap sheet is as long as your arm with like, annual domestic battery charges for example, you might just decide to stay home... It seems a little irresponsible *not* to check at all.", "It's true, but you can trust me. I'm Abraham Lincoln.", "Some people do disclose personal information when they\u2019re organising a meet up. \n\nEven then, OP isn\u2019t wrong for wanting to be safe with a person they\u2019re meeting up with for kinky reasons. It\u2019s clear the intent is to participate in BDSM, what\u2019s so wrong with wanting to be sure they\u2019re not a dangerous person?"]}
