Without knowing it, I don\u2019t think people can say if you or they were the asshole. We\u2019re just guessing based on the concept of \u2018is someone bad for telling someone they checked out their background\u2019, to which the answer is most likely that looking up someone\u2019s background info is fine when you\u2019re going to go on a date with them. \n\nBut the way you tell someone you looked into their background could significantly impact their reaction.

Is running background checks on potential dates normal practice now?! That sounds insane to me. How is that not a violation of privacy and trust?

I say this judgment not because you ran the check, but because you told him. As the person you responded to said, he\u2019d never have known.

There is no trust to be violated.", ">It is a violation of his trust\n\nThat trust can only go so far, can't it? I mean, it sounds like most of what OP looked at, like Linkedin, was stuff that he made publicly available.", "I disagree. Meeting a stranger from the internet *requires* some level of trust. Violating it is valid in some circumstances, and is not valid in others. In this case, OP violated that trust for a good reason.", "Disagree: If you don't trust someone enough to meet up, you don't meet up.", "So if someone stalked all the information about you online they could find and told you about it, you would have *zero* negative reaction to that? In highly doubt it. I have been in that situation, and while I wasn\u2019t nearly as juvenile as the guy OP did it to about it, I was slightly offended and did feel slightly violated. However, that was outweighed by the knowledge of the dangers women can and do face in today\u2019s world.", "Sure, but he wasn't on the app under his own name; it's an anonymous app. They were communicating under a certain level of anonymity and deniability, about some pretty personal and sensitive things. Deciding to let someone connect that part of you to your public life is a particular act of trust that one wants to have some control over. Obviously he was getting ready to take that step by asking to meet up, but it wasn't a done deal yet and OP took the choice away from him.\n\nI understand OP's reasons for sure and I don't think it was an inherently wrong thing to do. But I think his sense of injury is understandable. It's NAH for me."]}
