Unfortunately, though, my brother refused, so I had to ring Gregory myself to tell him that he would most certainly not be coming due to how he had shown he was unable to treat his step-grand-daughter well.\n\nWilliam started to call me the asshole, saying that he had not been able to see Gregory for years due to his stretched financial conditions, and that I had likely just taken away his only chance to see our father, which (as I likely don\u2019t have to mention) he has/had always loved dearly.

He is living in your home and refusing to accept the boundaries of the home.", "NTA\n\nIts not William's home. Never invite people to other people's homes without their permission thats like rule numero uno. If you're uncomfortable with Gregory setting up in your house thats all there is to it. If it means so much to William he needs to go meet him elsewhere for lunch or some shit. \n\nHe knew your aversion to your father and decided to ask forgiveness rather than permission which is peak asshole behaviour.", "NTA. William can move out of your house and go live with his father. Problem solved.", "NTA but your brother is. You already told him that your dad was 'persona non grata' in your house and he totally ignored you. If he can't abide by the rules of the home you so graciously provided him then he can find another place to live.", "NTA. I want to commend you for protecting your step daughter from your father\u2019s horrible behavior towards her. Too many times I\u2019ve seen people argue to the hurt party to just accept it or \u201cdeal with it\u201d to keep the peace. I\u2019m sure she is grateful for you standing up for her. Also, I\u2019m sure your father is not clueless as to what the problem is and he could have tried to make amends at any time (I am assuming based off of the him still not being welcome rule that he has not). So his lack of invitation is on him, not you and your husband. What your brother did after fully knowing the situation was very much AH behavior and really kinda manipulative. I\u2019m guessing he was hoping it would play out with you \u201cjust having to accept it\u201d since the invite had already been made. Good job for not passively pretending it was out of your hands but rather sticking to your boundaries.", "NTA.  You guys talked about it.  Agreed that it wasn't going to happen. Then your brother went ahead and did it anyway.  \n\nIf he really wanted to see your father, he should have met him at a restaurant.  Not at your house.", "You're my hero, OP. Thank you for putting your (step)child first.\n\nNTA. You're bother was testing you to see whether he could dictate what happens in your home. I think a real heart-to-heart with William about boundaries is in order.", "NTA - you are putting your kid first and nothing else matters. Your brother can go visit whomever he would like but he doesn't get.to decide who visits your home.", "NTA. This is rich coming from someone who is in financial duress. He went behind your back to overstep a boundary and this a big enough offense that he should be kicked out of the house.", "NTA. As other posts so far have pointed out it was your brother who made the AH move. But it is a sad situation. Hopefully your father can apply his airline credit (from his cancelled flight) to fly your brother to see him at Christmas.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother and father are tho. Especially your brother as he agreed with you and then decided to invite daddy dearest to YOUR house. Then acted like a kid and didn't accept consequences of his actions and made you the bad guy. Your brother sounds like he doesn't respect boundaries.", "NTA your brother is an entitled AH and is using you and your husband's kindness.", "I\u2019m confused. Is William completely unaware that the home belongs to Hailey\u2019s father? Therefore it\u2019s HER home and not his own?
