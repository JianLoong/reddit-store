There should be clear boundaries laid out about the do\u2019s and dont\u2019s when you\u2019re watching someone\u2019s kid. The parents should have stated what they are comfortable with and the pool 100% should have been a topic of conversation considering the dangers. I do think the parents reaction was pretty understandable tho. Not knowing this kids capabilities when it came to swimming and not knowing how to swim yourself is just a disaster waiting to happen. It also doesn\u2019t sound like the child had a life jacket on either. I\u2019d suggest taking a swimming class and even a water safety class before being responsible for a child around a body of water", "YTA I can swim very well, I'm an EMT, and I've taken lifeguarding classes...I still never take my nephews into the pool without my sister's permission and their life jackets. I understand wanting to cool him off, but you could have run him a cool bath.", "I hesitate to call you an A because you had good intentions, but in this situation YTA.

If you could swim, you wouldn't have been an a-hole. I don't blame them at all for not letting you play with him anymore. I wouldn't either.\n\nHowever, the smoking thing makes them a-holes. You didn't say what they were smoking, so I'm going to assume cigarettes, but these days - who knows. If it was cigarettes, they should be the ones going outside to smoke, not sending their child outside in hot/humid weather so they can light up in the comfort of their living room. I smoked for 20 years, and I never smoked in the house. If it was weed, they're shitty parents and deserve to have their child taken away from them by CPS.", "YTA.

You took a baby into a pool when 1) they couldn\u2019t swim and didn\u2019t have any sort of floatation device on and 2) YOU couldn\u2019t swim to rescue the baby if something horrible happened and 3) you don\u2019t know small child CPR for after the rescue you couldn\u2019t do because you can\u2019t swim.", "YTA", "INFO- you getting paid to babysit?", "[deleted]", "I don't think you're an Ahole; that's an exaggeration.

Your nephew's parents overreacted from you sitting on the poolsteps with your nephew in your lap JUST so he couldn't suffer from the heat at 28mo, since they don't allow you (and him technically) in the only area with fans that work. I'm guessing there were already some issues beforehand between you and them for you to not ask if you could do so?", "NTA\n\nYou were hanging out with their kid like they wanted you to.\n\nHowever, for future reference - until you can swim maybe avoid the pool?", "So they force you to babysit so they can smoke something in their living room with their friends?

How the hell could you be so foolish to take a toddler to a pool without letting their parents know AND while you yourself don\u2019t know how to swim.

Hell, I know how to swim and I wouldn\u2019t go to a pool without letting someone know where I was going. In fact, it was well into my teenagerhood before my parents let up the \u201cone of us needs to be outside if you\u2019re swimming in the lake\u201d rule. What if you slipped? What if your nephew squirmed out of your arms and fell into the pool. It can only take 20 seconds for a child to drown. What would\u2019ve happened if you looked away fro 20 seconds and your nephew inhaled some water? You were foolish and broke their trust.", "NTA\u2026BUT that was an irresponsible thing to do.
