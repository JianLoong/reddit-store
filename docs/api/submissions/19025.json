I'm sure, you were on the shallow end stairs with a 2 year old who I'm also sure, has a wee bit of height at this point, (even if he \"dropped\" youd have enough arm length to grab him and hed be fine) if you were just sitting on the shallow steps with him IN your lap, I don't see the danger, your family are assholes for how they just blew up, and you maybe should have asked first. But if there's no harm done, don't worry about it too much. It's just parents being overprotective when they over read a situation.", "Total YTA\n\nYou can't swim, why do you have a small child near the water??\n\nWould you put him in the back seat and try driving when you  don't know how to drive?", "YTA", "YTA - full stop. Water safety is so important. People that CAN SWIM!! die from drowning every year. You put yourself at risk for no reason, and then endangered your nephew for no reason. If he drowned, would you consider that manslaughter? Bc I wouldn\u2019t consider it an accident.", "ESH. You can't swim, if he had fallen you wouldn't have been able to help him. Even if you could swim you should have asked permission or let an adult know. The adults suck here for smoking indoors in the only room with any fans on a hot day", "YTA. So dangerous for you to take their toddler out by the pool when you can\u2019t swim. You have to get permission to do that anyway. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you swim? All humans need this skill. Go take adult swim lessons now. Seriously.  So bad if you or your future kids die because you didn\u2019t do this.", "YTA - you do not take children into potentially dangerous situations without the express permission of the parents. Ever. In fact you basically don\u2019t move out of sight of said parents without permission. twice as bad since you can\u2019t swim so if he did somehow get away from you (and kids can be incredibly adept at that) you would potentially be unable to access all parts of the pool in order to rescue him.", "NTA. As you said, you were at the shallower side of the pool. Bad things can happen as you walk down your street, you and your nephew were safer at the pool.", "Okay, but the shallow end of a backyard pool is at most 4 foot.  You can stand up and touch bottom unless you're REALLY short.  And she was on the steps, so even shallower.   Not being able to swim in that situation, though far from ideal, is not really dangerous beyond the obvious of squirmy baby in water deeper than a wading pool.  By that I mean that her being a non-swimmer didn't  actually exacerbate it.   \n\nThat said, she should have checked with the parents before taking the kid into the pool.", "What OP was stupid, but not everyone can swim. I never learned to swim because my abusive dad's 'method' was throwing me in the deep end at 4 and telling me to learn or die, and I'm now in my mid 20's and can't swim.", "I'd have said because she called a almost 2.5 year old child 28 months. At what point do we start using their age in years and not months?", "Children under the age of 3 are usually referred to by how many months old they are. There's a huge difference between 24 and 35 months old.", "19 is old enough to vote and play lottery here in America. I think it\u2019s safe to say that 19 should be old enough to recognize the dangers of taking a toddler to a pool while not knowing how to swim. Saying OP is young is a moot point IMHO.", "I wasn't in the deep section. I could easily reach down and get him if that happened", "I know CPR and I was at the shallow end of the pool", "I will never understand how people can be so careless around water. I\u2019m from a similar place that you describe and I see people from other places act so carelessly around water and need saving constantly", "I mean, I wouldn\u2019t trust any 2 year old to be competently swimming", "Finally, one good response.", "YTA. So dangerous for you to take their toddler out by the pool when you can\u2019t swim. You have to get permission to do that anyway. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you swim? All humans need this skill. Go take adult swim lessons now. Seriously.  So bad if you or your future kids die because you didn\u2019t do this.\n\nIf you even ever babysit and the kid wanders out and falls into the pool, you would standing there watching the kid drown while you wait for the emergency squad to get there. You couldn\u2019t even jump in and save them.", "That would be 2yrs and 4 months", "but then do you take children into a pool with no one else there to watch? She's TA because she took a baby into a pool without being able to swim, not TA \\*because\\* she can't swim.", "2 years old.  For the first 2 years of a child's life the changes in their body from one month to another is huge.  Afterwards there isn't much of a change each month.", "Hahaha! That is a fair reason for the AH verdict!", "They aren't actually saying that *not being able to swim* makes her an asshole (at least I'm pretty sure they're not), they're saying that *choosing to take a child into a situation where he could potentially fall in a pool while knowing that she can't swim* makes her an asshole.\n\nNot that it would have been fine if she could swim, should still have asked the parents, but... what was her plan here? What if the kid got wriggly and fell in? Just watch him struggle? Jump in after him and then they're both in trouble?", "At 19, it is HER fault.", "How is that the parents fault? OP is 19!!", "Oh yeah, I for sure agree. I have some concerns about the general negligence of the parents and independent of this particular situation I fully believe the parents are TA. Only reason i went YTA on this instead of ESH was because OP (unintentionally) put the baby in an extremely dangerous situation on multiple levels which in this context I think takes precedence over the negligence.", "Until the age of 3, seriously? Wow", "Why would you risk that? \u2018It\u2019s fine because I do know CPR\u2019 I\u2019m ACLS trained and haven\u2019t been able to resuscitate children. You should be scared of the water. Don\u2019t ever risk children around it", "learn how to swim and then you can take a kid to the pool.", "Me neither, but if I have a pool my baby will learn how to swim the moment or before they know how to crawl. Those 10-30seconds that it holds itself over the water are waaaay too valuable if it can move around alone.", "It's more standard to use months for the first two years, and then just say years (possibly with half years).", "Sorry this isn\u2019t a good comparison. A good comparison would be. Would it be safe for OP to SIT IN A NOT RUNNING CAR without a license\u2026. OP was sitting on the step of the pool\u2026. Not even swimming or deep enough to have to stand.. How is that equivalent to driving a car without a license.", "I completely agree with all of this. She couldn't have helped if something went wrong. On top of that, she should have asked no matter what. But especially given that she can't swim.", "It is kind of weird that they are SO concerned about their child's safety that they A) smoke indoors and B) use that an excuse to keep their child out of the one cool space on a hot day and then C) leave their child with someone they apparently don't trust....  \n\n\nI don't actually think the OP is completely TA, but maybe just didn't think things through very well. OTOH, I wonder a LOT about the parents.", "I think it might relevant for going in the pool. There is a huge difference in how a just-turned-2 will behave around water compared to an almost-3.\n\nESH - it sounds like OP is an unpaid babysitter for older siblings' social gatherings so they can do whatever they want without parental responsibilities. OP definitely shouldn't take a kid in a pool without permission, but maybe the parents should actually, you know, treat her like a person and be considerate that she's watching their kid in uncomfortable conditions instead of being with the other adults and at least offer some options instead of just screaming at her for finding a solution.", "Generally yes and no. Between 2 and 3 most people stop using months, but pediatricians and doctors and specialists tend to use it when doing developmental skills checks. So like the ides is if you're generically talking about your kid you'd say \"oh he's 2\" but if you're talking about something developmentally related you can reference months to see where it chalks up to other same months developmental, since 24 months, 30 months and and 35 months will all have different skills despite all being 2 years old.", "Aah, okay, that makes sense, thank you for clarifying!"]}
