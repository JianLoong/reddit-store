Two of them were muslim, but one of them, Sasha (not real name) converted because she didnt feel comfortable practicing anymore.\n\nMy other friend Aliya, is still a conservative muslim, and makes it clear that she does NOT approve of what sasha did. Everytime we eat something together, she asks us to say bismillah before eating our food even though we're not muslims. She also makes night outs very uncomfortable because she doesnt drink and when the rest of us do she just sits there with a sour face rolling her eyes and ruins the mood. \n\nShe does alot of other things like this and keeps trying to get sasha to practice faith again or wear her hijab again etc etc.\n\nYesterday, we had another night out because we wanted to celebrate my other friends engagement. So naturally, Aliya was invited. She was fine for the first half of the evening untill the drinks came out. When she saw sasha drinking she started crying and said that Allah will never forgive her for her sins and she will go to hell for not practicing anymore. She also called sasha a slut (kinda) for not wearing a hijab anymore. Sasha was visibly shaken and she left the room. \n\nI lost it and started yelling at aliya and I told her to shut the fuck up and stop trying to convert people. I told her to fuck off with her propogada and take her stupid opinions elsewhere. Aliya got REALLY mad and she started yelling at me and saying I was islamophobic and that I wasnt raised right. She said these horrible thoughts are coming in my head because  Im not practicing the right religion. She said I was a gigantic asshole and she was just trying to make this engagement a turning point for \"the people who needed it.\" All of my friends are on my side, but I just want to know am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1679752842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121mpjt/aita_for_telling_my_muslim_friend_to_stfu/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It isn't anyone else's business but their own to what religion they practice. If Sasha is more comfy as a different or even non believing then Good for her. If Aliya likes to believe in her religion, good for her. But shoving it down other people's throats isn't cool.", "NTA. If Aliya can't STFU and stop lecturing others, she needs to go away. Her faith is her business, and you're not disrespecting it, but she has no right to lecture or proselytize at everyone else. Your friendship with her is likely doomed, in any case, so it might be time you all cut her loose.", "NTA - she is forcing her religion on others. You don't have to pretend that it's ok for her to treat you like that. If she can't keep herself from oppressing others, she should not have friends.", "It sounds like Aliya is not enjoying what the rest of your group wants to do and is only coming to push her religion on others. I would suggest you all together tell her that has to stop or you won't invite her out with you any more.", "NTA - also, why is she still even being invited to places where alcohol is going to be apart of the night? Why is she accepting invites to go somewhere, where she knows alcohol will be involved? \n\nJust because she had a certain set of beliefs, doesn't mean everyone else in life needs to follow them. \n\nI'd stop inviting her anywhere.", "Whyyy are you even on speaking terms with Aliya? She is a religious fundamentalist and I don\u2019t care if she is a bible thumping Baptist or a muslim, she is obnoxious AF and you don\u2019t want to hear from her anymore. \n\nYou aren\u2019t being islamophobic, you are protesting against a totally obnoxious person that won\u2019t mind their own fucking business. There is a difference. \n\nShe is throwing out hot button words to deflect from the truth of the situation. That\u2019s toxic AF.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your other friends are right to be on your side. You can take religion out entirely and Aliya would still be in the wrong for trying to force Sasha to do what Aliya thinks is right. Nothing to do with Islamophobia. Switch religion in this scenario with like veganism or something... Aliya is still the AH.", "NTA as while Aliya has every right to practice her religion she does not have the right to enforce it on others.  I know y'all are inviting her out of courtesy but if you know she's going to make a scene stop inviting her to activities where she's going to make a scene.  Her behavior has shown she does not respect others", "NTA. Proselytizing and trying to impose your religion on others in any way is terrible.", "nta\n\nyou where not being islamophobic\n\nyou were protecting someone\n\nyou have not talked bad about her religious beliefs but with this line she has done to yours \n\n\"She said these horrible thoughts are coming in my head because Im not practicing the right religion\"\n\nshe has her right to practise her beliefs but not to judge or make people feel unsafe with them or to use them to make anyone feel bad", "NTA - this person seems to be very intolerant of everyone else's faith and wanting to bully you all into conversion. While I fully respect the rights of others to practice their faith it is not OK (in my opinion) to try and force it on anyone else. You did right by sticking up for your friend who was upset by this person's actions. They know what behaviour you guys engage in, if they don't like it they need to leave the group and find some other like minded folks", "NTA. That\u2019s just what the hyper religious do. They act like they\u2019re the victims when people don\u2019t want their bullshit. If it\u2019s islamaphobic to not want to be preached at about something you or others don\u2019t believe in then the definition needs to change.", "NTA. There is no one \"true\" religion or other belief system. Your \"friend\" is wrong and not really a friend at all. Next time tell her she can hang around other Muslims if it bothers her so much.", "NTA.  No issue with being a Muslim, but her harassing non-Muslims and especially an ex-Muslim is 100% out of bounds.  She needs to find other conservative friends if this is how she's going to behave in mixed groups.", "NTA.  She's abusing your other friend.  That's never ok, and she needs to be called out for it.\n\nBut it might be time for your circle of 5 to become a circle of 4.    It's hard to give up on someone you have considered a friend your whole life, but sometimes you just have to recognize when they have become toxic or their priorities have changed to the point where they are in conflict with yours.\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't stay friends on a casual basis, but it's time to consider whether she should be hanging out with a group of people she clearly disrespects.", "NTA, Your friend was being generally annoying and definetly needed to keep quiet. Theres probably a good chance she does believe everything she told you all though and chances are she thinks she\u2019s doing the right thing. But she needs to realise that not everyone is going to be willing to listen to her and stop after realising none of you believe in the same things she does.\n\nAlso she shouldn\u2019t be slut shaming your other friend, she should apologise to her.", "NTA. I mean generally it\u2019s not healthy to leave it until you boil with anger and react by yelling. It\u2019s always better to set boundaries before you get to this stage, like no mention of religion and such when you hang out. \n\nIt seems like Sasha needs to chill with a different group of ppl.", "why does she..go out drinking if she disapproves so much?doesnt she have muslim friends?", "NTA. She accuses you of being intolerant, yet berates you for living your own lives according to your own beliefs. That it hypocrisy at its finest. Having a strong religious faith can be a great thing, up until the point where you try to force it onto others.", "NTA. Aliya should stop forcing the religion on everyone. I\u2019m a Muslim myself but this ain\u2019t it. She seems very religious, so the best course of action would be for her to find new friends who are on the same religious level as her, and certainly not friends that drink.", "YTA for continuing to include her.", "NTA Im growing really fucking tired of entitled muslims who wanna convert everyone and impose their religion on people", "Nta. Her faith has nothing to do with this behavior; this is pure ego. She wants to feel like she's better than the rest of you, and she's singling out someone to bully to that end. You were fully in the right to shut her down, but from now on... just dont invite her anywhere. In fact, just block her on everything. A \"friend\" like that is no friend worth the stress of keeping around.", "NTA and stop being her friend. When people\u2019s values don\u2019t align with yours, it\u2019s usually time to let them go. There\u2019s plenty of conservative Muslims she can go find.", "NTA... Sort of... I think. You might consider if there was a nicer or calmer way to express yourself over Aliya\"s truly dispicable behavior. If so, that might have been a less asshole-ish way to handle it. But, I'd be annoyed to the ends of the earth with her nonsense and probably would have done the same as you. \n\nI think it needs to be said that you are not islamaphobic. Firstly, there's no phobia here. But, secondly it doesn't appear to against the faith in general but just the one individual... Is there a name for that?\n\nStop inviting her. Tell her why, but just don't ruin your time out with toxic behavior. Life's too short.", "NTA\nSomebody smart once said that religion is like a penis : there's nothing wrong with having one and to enjoy it in private, but as soon as you take it out and hit people with it, you're in the wrong.\nI teach at a school with many Muslim students and I regularly have to give that speech (different wording, of course) when some of them are playing super Muslim. As one of them said \"We need Allah, but Allah doesn't need us\". And he surely doesn't need Alliya (regardless of his existence)", "So, interesting. Religion and Politics, the two things not to discuss, right?\n\nAliya is 100% in the wrong for the nonstop comments. She is free to practice whatever religion she wishes. She\u2019s free to form an opinion of others based on that religion. **But she isn\u2019t free to force or coerce others to conform to that religion (say bismillah with me!) or hold a public court (Allah will never forgive your sins).**\n\nI get your reaction, and it wasn\u2019t an action, it was a reaction. \n\nNTA - with a gentle but\u2026.\n\nBut, you also don\u2019t get to hold a court of public opinion. *You did great, right up to the \u201cpropaganda\u201d part.* Insulting someone\u2019s faith isn\u2019t a good move. Again - Get why you did in the heat of the moment and all, but that can be handled better in the future. Pushing back with simply \u201cYour faith is not mine. Keep yours away from me and I will do the same for you\u201d without disparaging their beliefs is a good place to try and land.", "Yay Anti Muslim posts for Ramadan.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That got dark.", "I actually didn't know that but i.honest to God hope that's wrong", "You kind of have to investigate why though first. In the country I'm living in there was a huge uproar about how a girl from this country went to study in the US on a scholarship and converted to Christianity. It turns out she was from a village and she grew up poor as her dad was the village drunk (ironic right). He couldn't work because no one wanted to hire him so the mom had to work menial jobs to support the family. The dad would beat the mom+kids and steal her money. The villagers didn't do anything to help them and the family was insulted and shuned for not being 'true Muslims' and having a 'disgrace' as the head of the family. \n\nSo the girl was brilliant, went to government boarding schools, got a scholarship and made her way to the US. She made friends and some were part of a church. She said when she started to join their activities she felt she was finally, truly and wholly accepted and she felt love for the first time. She said when she was growing up she was so so angry at God and blamed God for her having such a miserable life and not helping her no matter how much she prayed (some people pointed out God did help her by giving her brains and because of that she got to study overseas which would be an advantage when applying for work). \n\nIt was a huge thing because she was interviewed so people her knew her name and where she grew up so there was a lot of finger pointing and blame shifting i.e. the village elders should have counselled the dad, the family would be entitled to tithes or possibly the mom could have gotten a divorce (unlikely though in that period as the courts weren't receptive of wives asking for divorce except in extreme cases). Of course there were people that took the easiet way blamed her saying it's a shame God gave her brains but she doesn't use them so it's not a loss if she's dead. But the religious leaders that are the type that walk the talk said that everyone failed her by not showing how true Muslims live.", "Growing apart from friends is a natural thing to happen. I\u2019d recommend the slow ghost from Aliyah, just slowly stopping communication. Your families will be fine.", "Fair enough, but obviously she thinks she''d be more comfortable with friends who were as strictly observant as she is.

At least maybe don't invite her to events with drinking or whatever else will upset her.", "Yeah that\u2019s a sucky situation but you can\u2019t allow these dynamics to continue. She also needs to be taught that she can\u2019t treat others that way and expect them to tolerate it. If she wants to hang out with only other religious friends, she needs to find some.", "Tell her that if you said exactly what she says but with substitution of Christianity, and she would be offended.

That's the rules of life, not ones I made up by the way. \n\nBesides, she's already given her secret away...she's not there to socialize with friends. She's there to save souls.

It seems like she's only accepting invitations to these events so she can have an excuse to be preachy about how sinful all of you are", "I agree, at the same time there is a chance she might have been indoctrinated into her beliefs (not being muslim but the slut shaming) and that people around her hold the same beliefs.\n\nIt\u2019s definetly not your job to do so and honestly I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you outright stopped talking to her, but if you plan on staying friends with her I wouldn\u2019t let the slut shaming slide because chances are she might do it again.
