Note that it was purchased solely by me, my wife did not help save for it (I started saving for it before I even met here) and it's in my name.\n\n\nWhen my parents threw us a party for this happy ocassion, mom asked for a copy of the key in case of an emergency. I let her have it which made my wife upset. She didn't say anything at the time but she waited til we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said \"why?!\" Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. She said that she does not feel \"comfortable\" with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to have a copy of the key. She also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should \"disqualify her\" from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but she kept presisting saying I need to take the key back. Quite frankly, this had me fuming. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. She screamed at me saying that \"technically\" she did contribute towards the house savings back when she used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money. I told her that she was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for her opiniins and keep undermining her input.\n\n\nWe've been going back and forth on it since then. She's now \"letting me know\" that if I don't take the key back then she'll do it herself. I think she's being irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key. This decision I made could save us in case of an emergency but she kept downplaying it.\n\n\nE.T.A I think it's crucial to mention that there's no conflict between my mother and my wife. They're on near perfect terms, alright? I thought that I've already established that above.", "created_utc": 1668432919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuzl0p/aita_for_letting_my_mother_have_a_copy_of_the_key/", "score": 10500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom could lose the key, it could be stolen, or any number of things and it made her feel uncomfortable. After all, this is where she sleeps at night and where she should feel the safest.

More than the key issue (which would make you an AH by itself), the fact that your wife covered rent and utilities to help you save for the house and you clearly mention that she did not save for the house makes you a bigger AH.

Let's say you did this for 3 years and you saved $30 grand (10 grand a year) Meanwhile, your wife paid rent Lets take it easy and say rent was $850 plus expenses of another $150. That would mean while you saved 10k a year she was spending 12k a year while you didn't contribute.   \n\n\nAlso trust, communication and honesty is key to any marriage to survive. Lose one of them the other two fall away.

Note that it was purchased solely by me, my wife did not help save for it (I started saving for it before I even met here) and it's in my name.\n\n\nWhen my parents threw us a party for this happy ocassion, mom asked for a copy of the key in case of an emergency. I let her have it which made my wife upset. She didn't anything at the time but she waited til we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said \"why?!\" Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. She said that she does not feel \"comfortable\" with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to have a copy of the key. She also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should \"disqualify her\" from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but she kept presisting saying I need tk take the key back. Quit frankly this had me fuming. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision tj decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of stiry. She screamed at me saying that \"technically\" she did contribute towards the house saving back when she used to pay for our rent and daily exprnses while I saved money. I told her that she was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for her opiniins and keep underminjng her input.\n\n\nWe've been going back and forth on it since then. She's now \"letting me know\" that if I don't take the key back then she'll do it herself. I think she's bring irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key. This decision I made could save us in case of an emergency but she kept downplaying it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That way she'd be able to gain access to the house in an emergency, but without permanent access to her own key.
