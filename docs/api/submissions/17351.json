It still sounds like an annoying behavior in a pattern of them. Ops allowed to get annoyed by behavior that annoys them. And they're allowed to ask for it to stop.\n\nThen based off that response they can make choices. In this case they'll likely want to apologize since they aren't ready to end their friendship over it. Personally I might make a different choice since I find \"playful thievery\" tiresome. \n\nRegarding the problematic aspect of it, I did a quick search and couldn't find anything other than some opinion pieces saying that. And many more saying it's the preferred terminology. If you have anything that says otherwise I'd be happy to look into it. \n\nLastly what behavioral traits an I pretending to be an authority on? Other than \"not stealing\". Or am I wrong there and you're saying that stealing is a symptom of autism.\n\n\nEdit to add since you blocked me and I can't respond directly: Not particularly upset, but thanks for you concern.\n\nI think the real issue is that none of ops friends behaviors are tied to their autism and have been showing a pattern of escalation.\n\nBut you want to give the friend carte blanche to do whatever.

I know I won't get it but I would appreciate an apology for being called ableist.", "Of course. I think your context here hurt you more than intended. Autism is a sensitive subject for good reason, and I think it muddied the waters on you a bit. You seem like a good friend to me who's just worried about escalating behavior.", "Gosh, an Autistic person who is invested in addressing ableist stereotypes that belittle, disregard, and disrespect the lived experience of Autistic people? What an outlandish thing to do! \n\nOh wait, no it's not. You're just extremely ableist, and are now upset that you're being called out for it. \n\nI'd recommend you try educating yourself from people who are *actually* Autistic, instead of pretending that you have any insight into Autistic behaviors being an allistic person with absolutely zero education in this subject. It's really not a good look sweetie.\n\nAnywho, I've got better things to do with my time, than continue to waste it on your ableist ignorance. \n\nToodles! \u263a\ufe0f", "I know it's sensitive. I probably handled it wrong. I just don't want this to all spiral into something massive."]}
