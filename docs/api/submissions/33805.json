It isn't a surprise as he was raised by his aunt n uncle since his parents were both 17 at that time and his grandparents were either no more or leaved out of the country. His parents never tried to make any contact with him anyhow. They had a daughter after 6 years who they cherished and thought of as their only child. Even though they were invited they didn't show up.  But only his sister had shown up,not expected but she was actually very respectful,apologised on his families behalf and didn't make up a fuss about anything . \nAlso his sister was not blind since birth, she had a terrible car accident due to which she lost her eyesight. \n\nOut of courtesy I still invited them to my wedding. I was so happy about his sister showing up, that I decided I wanted her to be my bridesmaid. Since she is blind and I also send special handwritten notes to my bridesmaids, I made her a tactile invitation card. I decided that as a activity that all of my bridesmaids would receive a card with a part of a painting in it, which I had gotten made by a professional painter of me and all my bridesmaids together. So when they would arrange and pin up against a softboard would look like a complete painting. \n\nI conducted this activity during my bachelors party. Also there were no expenses left at making my SIL feel like she was just as cherished and a part of the celebration as others. The part of the painting on her card was also tactile around the borders and read in braille \"You and Me\".After pinning all if them on the board my SIL went ahead to touch it and that's where everything went downhill. \n\n\nApparently she expected everyone's card to be tactile to honour her and make her feel included. So when she went to feel them and couldn't feel the tactile marks and realised others had gotten a plain card threw a whole fit about it. She ruined my bachelors party and posted on her IG that I am a jerk and my wedding should be as empty as possible and that  her brother is a fool to marry me. This broke my heart but my fiance supported me and we went on with the wedding. At first I didn't know why she had a social media account in the first place but still decided to tell my friends , family and bridesmaids to follow her since she  requested and now I deeply regret it. I haven't said anything to her because now I know nothing I do will be able to fix my broken heart and that I count be bothered enough to care for her.\n\n( Edit : It really was a surprise and due to some complications with our planner we didn't have much time to plan and that's why only my SIL received a tactile card.

Every single aspect of your life changes, you lose all your independence, you have to relearn how to do everyday tasks, going out in public is terrifying and you need specialist training to learn how to do it (mobility and orientation training) because it's very difficult and dangerous to navigate the outside world without vision. If you lost your vision tomorrow, how would you go about crossing the road and trying to walk to somewhere that was previously familiar? If you got disoriented, how would you figure out where you were? Then there's the isolation. Your friends and family don't really understand the magnitude of what you've experienced, they may even express frustration at having to support you to relearn basic tasks. Eventually your relationships will dwindle as your friends and family move on with their life while you're still trying to figure out how to live with your disability.

She was happy to make something for SIL. \n\nThis is the kind of mistake that I could have made because I tend to look at what at did for the person individually not the whole picture. Plus maybe OP thought that she could read it for SIL. I know I would have thought this: I want her to feel included so I will make her part tactile and I can read her, her part. \n\nNo bad intention. Just an honest mistake. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t agree with this comment, OP is not a mean girl. She is just a bride that wanted to include her disable SIL and didn\u2019t think it fully through. \n\nAt this point, SIL could have talked to OP after the bachelorette and say:\u00a0 \u00ab\u00a0 Hey thank you for making me a tactile card, I just wanted to point out that the rest wasn\u2019t tactile. If you do another activity like this, could you make it all tactile? I felt like my disability kept me from fully experiencing the bachelorette gift. I hope you understand.\u00a0\u00bb\n\nBut SIL instead of using her words and being kind, went nuclear. People without disabilities don\u2019t always get what it\u2019s like.
