My SIL is blind and me and y husband are not close with her or any of his family really. He doesn't really contact them and has advised to me to do the same. It isn't a surprise as he was raised by his aunt n uncle since his parents were both 17 at that time and his grandparents were either no more or leaved out of the country. His parents never tried to make any contact with him anyhow. They had a daughter after 6 years who they cherished and thought of as their only child. Even though they were invited they didn't show up.  But only his sister had shown up,not expected but she was actually very respectful,apologised on his families behalf and didn't make up a fuss about anything . \nAlso his sister was not blind since birth, she had a terrible car accident due to which she lost her eyesight. \n\nOut of courtesy I still invited them to my wedding. I was so happy about his sister showing up, that I decided I wanted her to be my bridesmaid. Since she is blind and I also send special handwritten notes to my bridesmaids, I made her a tactile invitation card. I decided that as a activity that all of my bridesmaids would receive a card with a part of a painting in it, which I had gotten made by a professional painter of me and all my bridesmaids together. So when they would arrange and pin up against a softboard would look like a complete painting. \n\nI conducted this activity during my bachelors party. Also there were no expenses left at making my SIL feel like she was just as cherished and a part of the celebration as others. The part of the painting on her card was also tactile around the borders and read in braille \"You and Me\".After pinning all if them on the board my SIL went ahead to touch it and that's where everything went downhill. \n\n\nApparently she expected everyone's card to be tactile to honour her and make her feel included. So when she went to feel them and couldn't feel the tactile marks and realised others had gotten a plain card threw a whole fit about it. She ruined my bachelors party and posted on her IG that I am a jerk and my wedding should be as empty as possible and that  her brother is a fool to marry me. This broke my heart but my fiance supported me and we went on with the wedding. At first I didn't know why she had a social media account in the first place but still decided to tell my friends , family and bridesmaids to follow her since she  requested and now I deeply regret it. I haven't said anything to her because now I know nothing I do will be able to fix my broken heart and that I count be bothered enough to care for her.\n\n( Edit : It really was a surprise and due to some complications with our planner we didn't have much time to plan and that's why only my SIL received a tactile card. I understand how, she could feel left out but was it really right for her to do that) ", "created_utc": 1703621327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18rgyxt/aita_for_not_correctly_including_my_blind_sil_in/", "score": 983, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You chose an activity that deliberately left her out. \n\nNgl, making her a bridesmaid just sounds like it was a terrible idea from the start.

Your wanted her to feel included, but the thing is that if she has the only tactile card, she can't, because she's not part of seeing the whole thing or together. She's supposed to put her card in a place and then gets no sense of what that was a part of.\n\nWith the best of intentions, you probably made her feel more left out than if you just hadn't included her in that activity", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your inclusion of your SIL was an afterthought. She wasn\u2019t part of your wedding party plans and it shows in all these little ways. The message being given is she was a B-list pity inclusion to the wedding party - it feels like a mean girl clique expecting the unpopular girl to just be grateful to be included. Like having her in the wedding party was purely for appearances. It feels like just having her as a guest would have been more sincere and kinder.", "This is either fake or you're leaving parts out.   \n\n\nI especially didn't like the part where you try to make out like you're the \"Blind saviour\" for making basic accomodations for one of your bridesmaids but then make comments like this \"At first I didn't know why she had a social media account in the first place\"  \nWhy wouldn't she have a social media account?

It was sweet and thoughtful, but u didn\u2019t seem to know she was that entitled or jealous. It\u2019s just pathetic how she acted, she was an after thought and treated like she\u2019d been there the whole time and ONE activity throws her off. Boo hoo", "Yep, not to mention that if she was that visually impaired, she'd have to have someone accompany her to enable her to get to op's house, aaannd... a blind person using Instagram?? Nah, this story's made up.", "I work in disability, losing your vision is very very traumatic, like almost indescribably traumatic. Every single aspect of your life changes, you lose all your independence, you have to relearn how to do everyday tasks, going out in public is terrifying and you need specialist training to learn how to do it (mobility and orientation training) because it's very difficult and dangerous to navigate the outside world without vision. If you lost your vision tomorrow, how would you go about crossing the road and trying to walk to somewhere that was previously familiar? If you got disoriented, how would you figure out where you were? Then there's the isolation. Your friends and family don't really understand the magnitude of what you've experienced, they may even express frustration at having to support you to relearn basic tasks. Eventually your relationships will dwindle as your friends and family move on with their life while you're still trying to figure out how to live with your disability. And then there's the process  of mourning your life and the future you thought you had. Does SIL have some mental health issues? Yeah mate I reckon she does.", "IG has alt text and image descriptions! So some people use a screen reader, and it describes posts to them", "Blindness is a spectrum. It is easier to say you are blind than explain your medical history. From personal experience(I regained my sight fully) I was still considered blind even when I could see big objects. Like no details but I could see there was something there and could tell the color. My friend is considered blind when to the school for the blind but can still see and use her phone. Granted things are very big and she prefers to read using braille cause it is less tiring.", "The literacy rate for blind people is abysmal.  (Think like 10 percent.) The chances that someone who became blind as an adult had access and time for Braille training rather than using a screen reader is incredibly small. Also, visually impaired people always carry a screen reader with them because your standard smart phone is actually an excellent screen reader.  All she\u2019d need to do is take a picture of the other cards and her phone would read them to her. I agree this is probably fake.", "Yeah it's really weird to have this group activity where the blind SIL is included on *only her part* then she just... doesn't get to experience the culmination which was the whole point of the activity?\n\nJust the taste, to know it's a thing that she can't share with the rest of them.

What a hurtful message for OP to give her, especially in front of everyone else.", "I simply don't understand why only the one card was tactile. Why couldn't they all be so she could get the full picture just like everyone else? Just because the cards are all tactile it doesn't ruin the others being able to see the final picture, but not doing all tactile cards does mean that for SIL.", "And OP can't write worth a damn", "It says she wasn\u2019t blind from birth???", "But she was an afterthought !!! OP clearly stated that they are not close. OP was surprised that SIL reached out and decided to include her.\n\nOP made tactile things to try and include SIL. What does she get with that ? You and SIL trashing her because she was trying to be nice.\n\nYou and SIL are the type of people no one wants to be kind to. And you two are wondering why when the answer is right here in your comment. People can never be kind enough for yall", "Of course the sister was an afterthought.... OP explains very well how the sister and brother were never close and she was surprised the sister actually wanted to come.\n\nI'm sure if the sister was never made a bridesmaid she would be upset that the wedding guest book wasn't tactile.", "Wedding planning is stressful and the post clearcly stated that SIL was added to the wedding party after OP realized that SIL wanted to come to the wedding.\n\nMaybe OP changed one card last minute to accommodate SIL so she could have an experience.\n\nI get what you mean but I sincerely think that OP didn\u2019t even think about that. She was happy to make something for SIL. \n\nThis is the kind of mistake that I could have made because I tend to look at what at did for the person individually not the whole picture. Plus maybe OP thought that she could read it for SIL. I know I would have thought this: I want her to feel included so I will make her part tactile and I can read her, her part. \n\nNo bad intention. Just an honest mistake. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t agree with this comment, OP is not a mean girl. She is just a bride that wanted to include her disable SIL and didn\u2019t think it fully through. \n\nAt this point, SIL could have talked to OP after the bachelorette and say:\u00a0 \u00ab\u00a0 Hey thank you for making me a tactile card, I just wanted to point out that the rest wasn\u2019t tactile. If you do another activity like this, could you make it all tactile? I felt like my disability kept me from fully experiencing the bachelorette gift. I hope you understand.\u00a0\u00bb\n\nBut SIL instead of using her words and being kind, went nuclear. People without disabilities don\u2019t always get what it\u2019s like. A lot of honest mistake like this are made and could be prevented from happening again, if the disabled person communicate effectively their disappointment. SIL went the wrong way.\n\nOP should honestly uninvite her at this point because if she cannot communicate without doing nuclear, OP wedding isn\u2019t going to be fun. She cannot make a whole wedding blind friendly and SIL is probably going to cause more drama.", "Yeah but a wedding is something a guest hears, you have music and dance and eat. All things that a blind person can appreciate even if she can't view it. This was something that was basically a mosaic. Unless you see the whole thing the part doesn't make sense. A wedding ceremony and reception isn't the same thing. I'd, I just think if you're Including the SIL you don't even really know as a bridesmaid it probably came off as a deliberate dig, intentional or not.\n\nIf it were me and I was trying to ensure I included my disabled bridesmaid I would have thought of it from her perspective, or even asked for input. OP went off her vision but didn't stretch far enough in her persprctive to fully include SIL. That said SIL didn't need to publicly blast OP either. \n\nESH for me."]}
