I said yes and was excited for the trip. \n\nHowever, my best friend (m26) got into a car accident the Wednesday before the trip, it wasn't that bad, but he broke an arm and was generally bruised and in a bad shape emotionally. So I told my boyfriend I won't be able to go to the trip since I wanted to be there for my friend. \n\nHe got very angry, he told me that he's fine and doesn't really need me there. I told him that he does, and the trip really wasn't anything special, just a work trip. He was upset so he said a lot of things, like saying if I just want to continue being single then I shouldn't have agreed to get back to him and such. We argued very bad that night honestly, the next couple days he tried changing my mind, but as he couldn't he let it go. \n\nHowever, since he came back he's been acting very cold toward me and practically ignoring me when I ask him for the trip, he just tells me \"it was fine\" or \"you would know if you had come too\".

You knew all that and volunteered that info!\n\n\n\u201cHowever, my best friend (m26) got into a car accident the Wednesday before the trip, *it wasn't that bad,* but he broke an arm and was generally bruised and in a bad shape emotionally. So I told my boyfriend I won't be able to go to the trip since I wanted to be there for my friend.\u201d \n\nYOU TOLD US \u201cit wasn\u2019t that bad\u201d about your friend\u2019s car accident and broken arm! Yeah yeah yeah\u2026 your friend \u201cwas in bad shape emotionally.\u201d Right right. So, you changed your mind on your bf since you \u201cwanted to be there for [your] friend.\u201d  The way to even attempt to repair a relationship after cheating is to be attentive, available and affectionate to your partner to show them you have strong feelings and are invested in them. Someone mentioned the trauma you likely inflicted on your partner, and I gotta echo that! I was cheated on once, and I never recovered. Before that, he could have told me whatever about where he was or why he didn\u2019t answer my calls or texts or what he was doing with whoever, and I was blindly accepting. After starting to feel that things were not right, feeling gaslit by preposterous explanations and months later, finding out what was going on\u2026 I went crazy. I forgave him, but whenever we were apart after that, whenever he was out of town or not coming with me somewhere or if he stopped responding to me by text or didn\u2019t answer my call, I would unravel, and my mind couldn\u2019t help but imagine the worst and wonder what he was really doing and with who, and wonder why he didn\u2019t value me or why I wasn\u2019t enough, and I didn\u2019t even want to see my friends, just wasted time obsessing and feeling the madness. I would be trying to pretend I was okay, because I didn\u2019t want him to know how crazy I was at that point. Nine months after reconciling, I left with no notice. I didn\u2019t want him to suck me back in with his charm and I didn\u2019t want to discuss it, I wanted to be myself again, so as he went on the road for work, I got my stuff, left a note and cut it all off. I cried for weeks, had no appetite (lost 10Lbs the first two weeks), tried to make reminders of the reasons I needed to stay away, etc. You think your friend is in bad shape emotionally over a stupid broken arm from a car accident? The emotional pain of being cheated on is heart wrenching, and a car accident that \u201cwasn\u2019t that bad\u201d has nothing on the emotional pain your cheating ass inflicted and continues to inflict on your partner.\n\n\u201cHe got very angry, he told me that he's fine and doesn't really need me there. *I told him that he does*,  and He was upset so he said a lot of things\u2026\u201d OH GOOD! You old him he DOES need you there, sounds like you get it then, but you do what you want!\n\n\u201cI feel like he doesn\u2019t 't want to understand my side. But AITA?\u201d Sounds to me like you just do what you want and he is trying to work around it and convince you to care about what he wants. I hope he realizes soon that he\u2019ll be happier once he walks away from you and that he could have a partner that values his emotions and won\u2019t blow him off or trivialize his feelings or keep breaking his heart.
