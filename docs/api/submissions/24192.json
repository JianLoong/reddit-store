Her behavior, as someone that is not from Massachusetts is totally normal. She was star struck and excited. \n\nOh and PS multiple vacations annually, summer houses on the cape- absolutely ARE a luxury and we live in a HCOL so I feel like her assertion of being looked down on for not being *enough* absolutely comes from a place of insecurity and probably wasn\u2019t too off the mark.\n\nEdit Matthew is your ex?

What \"situation\"? You barely describe any of her behavior, just few comments, As described, you and these other rich assholes are acting far stranger than the girlfriend. The insistence that you are not rich, combined with how off-putting an outsider's perspective on wealth is, means you're fucking rich. A nice house comfortable for six kids definitely means wealthy, particularly in that area. Yearly vacations on the Cape doesn't necessarily mean wealthy, my family definitely was not, but I grew up taking vacations to the Cape. The weirdest thing about the GF is her expectation of the Cape, it doesn't have the reputation being described. Maybe 30 years ago. Yes there are still many expensive This is  houses, but in general it's kind of trashy. You're not running into celebrities on Cape Cod. \n\nYou don't specify the accommodations, but I'm guessing this isn't a random cottage you're renting.

No understanding of how big the world is. He assumed we all know *Somerville* as if he were a child. I wonder if he even went out of state for college, if he went. Dude's living in a bubble. I could imagine him doing a European tour, eating in American restaurants the whole way!", "Had her vetted by his EX!

I've only been in one relationship prior to this, and it was with Matt actually. Lol. It was a situation where he and I just understood each other implicitly. I'm not saying there wasn't communication or that we didn't put in work, but we never had to sit down and have a conversation like this. I'm also not used to having to formally introduce someone to parents either since we already knew each other's. We already knew we meshed.
