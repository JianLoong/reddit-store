Her parents were both doctors.\n\nFinally visited this \"cottage\" a year or so later.\n\n*Sprawling mansion with vaulted ceilings on a cliff in a ritzy little off-the-beaten-path enclave of other sprawling mansions on a cliff over looking the biggest lake in the area. With a private stairway down to their own section of the beach.*\n\nShe never had any conception she was \"rich\".", "Because that would require him to be an adult, and I assume he's still a child.", "Because they live here probably? The Cape is a super working and middle class vacation spot, or was until pretty recently. There are pockets of wealth but mostly it's just where people from Eastern MA go when they want to go to the beach.", "Because I live in Massachusetts and all it takes is a car to get to the Cape. It\u2019s not like you have to fly in, or take a ferry. Normal people from every class of life in Massachusetts go to the Cape in the summertime. It is not expensive to get there, or exclusive. Beaches are free\u2026 not like in Malibu, where you only get to enjoy if you have a waterfront home\u2026", "He has an odd fixation with Matthew otherwise", "Ooh I didn't see that comment. The best friend/ex boyfriend is such a reddit trope at this point.", "Saying \"I have a house on the Cape\" is not an indicator of wealth, if that house cost $2000 and you got it for free. It's an indicator that sometime on the last 60 years someone had a little money stashed away. (And the bungalow is definitely not worth $2M lol!)", "I recently got the entire song and dance from my friends (who as kids got all the coolest toys and newest phones and as adults have their rent paid in full by their parents) because I told them I'd never been in a hottub or a sauna. To clarify they were most confused I'd never stayed at a hotel that has these. The only hotel in our area that has the hottub is 450 a night. Half my rent.", "There's no way OP and Matt haven't hooked up at some point", "That makes sense.\n\nI think I dropped the ball here in terms of not talking to her to clear things up. I've only been in one relationship prior to this, and it was with Matt actually. Lol. It was a situation where he and I just understood each other implicitly. I'm not saying there wasn't communication or that we didn't put in work, but we never had to sit down and have a conversation like this. I'm also not used to having to formally introduce someone to parents either since we already knew each other's. We already knew we meshed. This is my first time trying to make that work with someone else and I'm realizing that it's not as easy as I thought it was, or as easy as I had experienced before.", "My family had never been on a vacation in my whole life...", "Not all of them were in the same social circles, but even if they were, we all have different life experiences despite that. If what you're really asking is if all my friends lived a similar lifestyle to mine, no they didn't.\n\nThe excitement I had seen in my friends previously was just excitement to spend time together and explore this new place. There was never any honing in on how much something was or it being a famous vacation spot. That's what put me off - if any of my friends had these thoughts, they never openly voiced them to me; I'm very glad they didn't because that's a little rude in my opinion. Originally I just thought okay, she'll move on from it / maybe she's just sharing it with me because she thinks I can relate to being focused on Matthew's family's wealth. But then she brought it up in front of them, and that made me feel pretty damn embarrassed. Speaking about how expensive or run-down an area is when an invitation has been extended to you to that place just seems like poor manners, to be completely honest.\n\nBut I definitely should have talked to her and let her know it wasn't cool before she met his family. I didn't do my job there.", "Umm.. New England is in the US", "Lol, opposite. From a wealthy enough family that I know how this works.", "Thank you - I've spent a LOT of time on Cape Cod as my grandparents retired up there, and other than the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, I'm trying to think of other \"celebrities\" you might see. I wonder if OP's girlfriend is confusing it with Martha's Vineyard?", "Oh for sure. I cut my teeth in Allston. \n\nHis family owns a nice big house in Somerville? Yeah\u2026 that\u2019s like saying you \u201cgo to school in Cambridge.\u201d", "I assumed Somerville, MA. Which isn\u2019t quite fancy, at least when he was growing up. Getting expensive now though.", "As a masshole, I thought he meant somerville, MA. in which case is gentrifying but in no way a rich fancy town. so I was confused lol.", "It's Somerville Massachusetts, until about 15 years ago it was mostly working class Portuguese, Brazilian, and Italian families living in triple deckers.", "that he can cheat on with his boyfriend while she's at pilates", "Not as frequently as those in other income brackets, at least insofar as my experience can be applied.", "Which, in my judgment, is what I said. There was no communication with the GF here, at all. I\u2019d be embarrassed as hell to be telling my SO they need to tone down their awe of fame and fortune, but if I did happen to be dating someone that odd, I\u2019d have to talk to them rather than just take away invites at random or there\u2019s no point to dating them.", "That's my point, he states his gf is new to the area and the way places are portrayed in the media can give off a grandiose impression.", "Blame Gilmore Girls. The rich people on that show vacationed at Cape Cod. Makes it sound fancy because they aren\u2019t the type of people who go to Myrtle Beach or Gatlinburg like a lot of us regular folk.\n\nIf Emily Gilmore approved of a vacation home there, it had to be nice. \n\nThey also went to Martha\u2019s Vineyard.", "Oh yea for sure, I get what you're saying now.  He definitely sounds like he did some exploring with Mathew when they were younger...", "Well he did admit in a different comment that Matthew was his first relationship\u2026", "That's literally the definition of generational wealth.\n\nAlso 2,000 times 100 is $200,000 not $2m. In a quick zillow search I see that the cheapest actual 3 bedroom house you can buy in Cape Cod is $229k. So I'm guessing your cousin inherited some decent wealth.", "I love them to death but sometimes it feels intentional how often they disregard the gap in our brackets", "Came here to say she's his beard. Lol", "You went to your ex about an issue with your current partner???? You don\u2019t see an issue with that?", "Just do your gf a favor and break up with her. Obviously you want to be with Matt.", "Way to bury the lede there. \n\nYTA 100000000%", "Dude. \n\nIt's fine to be gay, but just own it.\n\nYou're a total and complete asshole either way, by the way. What kind of jackass invites someone on a trip like this, and then yoinks it out from under the person?\n\nYou need some perspective on life.", "Does your gf know you two are exes?? Could that factor into why she's uncomfortable with you going on this trip with him and without her, particularly given you'll take issues with your relationship to him???", ">I've only been in one relationship prior to this, and it was with Matt actually. Lol.\n\nOf course it was. Now I see where this is going. Just get back with Matthew, it's him who you love. Don't string your girlfriend along, thats not fair to her.", "I\u2019ve been on one and it was only because my grandfather reverse mortgaged his house after he lost his job and took the money from that to make memories with us before he was dead. \n\nNot gonna lie, it was a mistake. He should have sold the house and bought something smaller because we ended up homeless after he died.", "Poor manners maybe, but you\u2019re still TA after getting her excited and talking to everyone but her. \n\nOnce again, I ask, what did you think she would do once there?", ">Not all of them were in the same social circles, but even if they were, we all have different life experiences despite that. If what you're really asking is if all my friends lived a similar lifestyle to mine, no they didn't.\n\n\nI think they were asking if they were from the same area as you. Growing up next to those expensive homes and/or celebrities, you tend to get used to it, but for someone who is not used to it, it becomes exciting.\n\nThe actual issue is you should have brought this up with her privately before making her look bad in front of your friends/family since now they will judge her poorly forever.  That makes you YTA", "Exactly.", "Maybe! That\u2019s a good point, could be like the way a lot of people say New York when they only mean Manhattan.", "I mean, OP is right, his family probably isn't like 0.1% rich, they just think their farts smell like 0.1% rich farts.", "I just realized that basically every state on the upper East Coast has a Somerville. So yeah, I guess it could be that one. Median house price there is still around $1M, though.", "Somerville and ellington typically gets associated together. Its old money pioneer valley, continue down that valley and rockville should be recognizable", "It could be. East Coast has way too many repeated town names.", "Only a true Slytherin would write that. Love it!", "Then your experience is very limited or you\u2019re extremely oblivious \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "But that's not what HE did. HE didn't even speak to her about anything. Hence, the child statement.", "When has the Cape been portrayed in the media as anything other than where middle class families go in the summer? I'm sorry but there's just no way anyone who has lived here for more than like five minutes thinks the Cape is something glamorous, her fetishizing it is extremely strange", "See Myrtle Beach sounds so fancy and exotic to me!", "Oop so it is. If he bought a second house on the Cape today yeah maybe, but simply saying they went to the Cape in the summer because his friend has a house there is not an indicator of anything much. I went to the Cape in the summer and my mom was a home health aide and my dad drove a vegetable truck. Wealthy? Not wealthy? We stayed at my grandfather's house, which was free for us (I did not inherit that house, alas, he sold it and moved to Florida with the proceeds).", "I was the friend and it's hard to get out of that mindset.", "You\u2019re [correct](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lpurf/aita_for_still_attending_a_vacation_my_girlfriend/jvcaut4/)", "It is today, it wasn't when this guy was growing up. Ten years ago a 2br condo was $230K, and if his parents own their house they probably bought it ,30 years ago for a song.", "My family doesn\u2019t discuss that unless it\u2019s major purchase time, and we certainly wouldn\u2019t address finances in front of a guest. Anyone over the age of twelve or so would certainly be getting the side eye and a reprimand to behave in public if they started gawking at famous people.", "As someone not from the area, I thought the Cape was like the Hamptons and the rich and famous vacay there\u2026a lot of people think that way", "Hey sooooo are you looking for any new friends?", "Damn that was too easy. I hope she dumps this self-important asshole.", "Still can\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t actually spend time around rich people or you\u2019re just in denial about the coded ways these things are talked about.\n\n\u2018Ugh, the Obamas are causing a huge traffic jam again, took me forever to get to Citarella\u2019\n\n\u2018My cousin is John Mayer\u2019s manager, we\u2019re hoping to get him to show up to the fundraiser on Saturday\u2019\n\n\u2018Did you hear the Smiths bought that house over by the water? Personally I think it\u2019s a little tacky but hopefully they can fix it up. I definitely didn\u2019t expect that to go over asking. I\u2019m going to suggest they talk to the contractor who did the renovations on our beach house\u2019."]}
