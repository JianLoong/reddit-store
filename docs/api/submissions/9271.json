It is not your mother's fault she had to do all that. Your father left. It's not fair what happened to her and neither is your harsh point of view (but it is understandable because you're only 20).

It's normal for young adults to feel resentful of the ways they can see they have been inadequately raised. We all at that age see our parents' flaws. But as we age and face similar problems we realize what a heavy lift that would have been for a single woman barely out of her teens to provide for and raise a child alone. It's too early for that, so in the meantime, make your apology sincere and offer to help her, just as she is helping you.", "For someone who claims she was trying to be brief, your post sure was long.

I get why you pulled a face! No doubt! Plus you apologized, which was cool. Give her time to cool down sweetie. But I really want you to understand and appreciate it that she was working instead of staying home and living off the government all your life. Plus she took the time off to go to your events.

I may have felt the same way at 21 as I am also from a poor single mother who worked multiple jobs to get by.\n\nI do think that you probably could have judged the situation better. You probably know your mother more than anybody else so you would know how she felt about this pregnancy when she told you by how she presented it. I would suggest you reach out to your mother. You need to talk this over with your mother because you are holding on to a lot of resentment over something she couldn't help.

YTA...she is allowed to live her life. She lived it for you all those years", "NAH! I know how this feels, and man it is such a bizarre, kinda lonely feeling. After years of neglect, seeing your mom heal and then become pregnant, possibly getting a bit of a retry with a new baby, it can feel almost like you\u2019re being replaced. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean your mom is at fault for being pregnant, but your feelings are totally understandable", "NAH  \nMy youngest sibling is 21 years younger than me.  I remember the shock when it was announced. My parents were too young when they had me, and I was pretty much on my own early on.  I was responsible for taking care of every younger sibling, so by the time the youngest came along I was done.  Your mom has every right to have more children, but you are entitled to your feelings.  Not sure what she is expecting, but you likely won't be living together so it won't be a \"typical\" sibling relationship.  \n\n\nIf it were me, I'd let her know that you were just shocked by the announcement, and hope she is happy.  I'd then go about my life as I planned.   Don't commit to babysitting :)", "NAH\n\nSometimes people trash talk things they desperately want, because there is no way for them to get the experience they want at that moment.\n\nFor example, my mom talked so much shit about McMansions.  Called them immoral and talked specifically about a particular set up as just bad parenting and \"evil.\"  I thought it was dramatic, but she was free to have her opinions.\n\nYeah.  Her finances changed, and she bought her \"dream house.\" Which... Had exactly everything that she'd ever claimed to hate.\n\nWhen I first responded with surprise and confusion, she was extremely upset.  Like being surprised was somehow judgement that she didn't deserve the things she wanted and had worked for.\n\nYour mom wanted the experience of motherhood without constantly working for survival.  She wanted to spend time with you and wanted another kid too.  She wanted to have a partner on that journey, and now she does.\n\nJust as she couldn't say before that she desperately wanted some things in life (more time to be a mom, a partner, etc), she can't say now why your surprise hurts.  People don't always make sense.  You weren't malicious in being surprised, and she isn't wrong for chasing what she wants.  Communication is hard sometimes.", "NTA. You are fully entitled to your feelings, and have very valid reasons for them as well. My suggestion would be to look into therapy. I\u2019ve seen this type of scenario play out a few times, and what often happens is the mother is in a completely different place in their lives having the second child, so naturally how they parent the second child is much different. What often happens is the older child then watches the younger get all the things they never had and missed out on. Basically they get the \u201cnew and improved\u201d mom, while the older one watches from the sidelines feeling hurt and resentful. Those are natural feelings I think anyone would feel in that situation. My advice is to try and find forgiveness and do your best to work through the emotions healthily otherwise they can eat you up and cause you a lot of pain. No matter what try and stay mindful the child is innocent in it all.", "NAH, unplanned kids happen, your reaction was a reflex. just try to be positive with your mom she might need emotional support during this.", "NTA", "Yes, YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom sacrificed for years so that you wouldn't live in poverty.   And your post reeks of resentment for her \"not being around\".    Well, FU!   She \"wasn't around\" because she was trying to provide a life FOR YOU, you ungrateful child.\n\nNot only that, but now she is paying half your rent and bills?  \n\n\nYou have an INCREDIBLE mom, that you simply don't appreciate enough.\n\nNow, she finally has a partner in life and comes to you with what she considers to be very happy news - and your reaction isn't joy and \"I'm so happy for you, mom!\" it is to make a face?  \n\n\nYou're a ungrateful and miserable brat.    \"YTA\" seems too mild of a description.", "NTA.

You\u2019d have to appropriately modulate your voice while saying it.  You have to be able to strike that correct neutral tone because you can easily mess it up by saying it \u201ctoo happily\u201d (could be perceived as being congratulatory) or \u201ctoo knowingly\u201d (could be perceived as some kind of insult about their appearance/attitude as if they\u2019ve been looking/acting poorly and now you know why) or \u201ctoo negatively\u201d (implying that of course pregnancy was a hardship or trial and causing offense that way.)\n\nAt least saying , \u201cCongratulations???\u201d is easier, because all you have to do is make that rising noise at the end of the word, not make sure the words themselves have a certain emotion.\n\nThat might seem silly to you, but honest to god I have to think about stuff like that.  I\u2019ve gotten a lot of unintended reactions over the course of my life because I say things \u201cthe wrong way\u201d even if the words are right.  It\u2019s worse because I\u2019m a woman.

It's normal that our views on pregnancy evolve.\n\n>they imply the baby isn't or shouldn't be wanted.\n\nNo, they imply that people are allowed to not want children, and that I don't pretend to know what their views on having kid should be.\n\n>They're inherently judgy in a negative way,\n\nI feel like it's the other way around. When someone comes with this new, saying \"congratulations\" is rude because you are implying that they SHOULD BE HAPPY no matter what. Asking them if they are happy is taking into consideration that not every one wants kids, and that you respect their decision. \n\n>Source: am pregnant.\n\nMy source : A friend in college got pregnant on a REAL bad luck (i.e. broken condom). It was not an easy situation for her. She had her abortion planned right in the middle of an exam. When she went to the teacher to explain why she would need to miss the exam, the teacher didn't even let her finish and told her \"CONGRATULATIONS!!!!\" and it just... made the situation way worst for everyone.\n\nSo yeah, different people, different views. When in doubt, asking a question is NOT rude.", "Theoretically you should be able to tell whether it's good news or not by the way it's delivered.

How are you feeling?\" is perfect.", "People can change their minds on wanting another child, especially when their life circumstances change. Your mother said for 13 years that she didn't want another child... bear in mind, the majority of those years were when she was a single parent. I imagine meeting her husband had a massive effect on what kind of future she would or could even consider, because now she has a partner/coparent/support network, which changes things a *lot*. \n\nYou say your mother wasn't around. OP... *my* mother wasn't able to get to a lot of school events, or needed a lot of notice to be able to get to the few she could, because she worked. Sometimes my childminders turned up to stuff so I could have someone there. My mother spend many nights working (from home, after she finished working at her workplace, because her role involved \"homework\", effectively), so I didn't get to just hang out with her then either. \n\nBut, my mother was also *married*, with an entire family/support network to fall back on, and childcare/childminders/babysitters. She was also older and married when she had me and my siblings. So please consider how much harder it was for your mother, when she had you at *19*, was kicked out by her family before that, and was a single mother. That's *why* she worked so hard. For YOU. \n\nI get how it feels when other kids have their mum at the nativity play and you don't. I get how it feels when your mum can't spend time with you at home in the evenings because she has to work. \n\nBut she was doing the best she could for you, under difficult circumstances. Also, if she hadn't worked so hard back *then*, I doubt your mother could be paying half your rent/bills *now*. \n\nSometimes our plans change when our circumstances change. Some people insist they'll never marry, then meet someone they *want* to marry. Some people can't fathom moving away from the place they grew up in, until an opportunity presents itself (like a job offer or something). \n\nCut her a little slack.", "Yes u are the ah", "YTA your mother is a woman who sacrificed decades for you to grow up safely and fed and cared for.

Unfortunately, this is what life is like.\n\nParents have to work their asses off to make ends meet. It doesn\u2019t sound like she was negligent, and you shouldn\u2019t be upset that she\u2019s having another child now that she\u2019s in a better place financially. Odds are, she didn\u2019t have another child years ago because she understood that her priority was providing for you.", "NTA.  Hey, I understand you feeling annoyed and some jealousy and anger about her having \"another\" child.  It changes YOUR hierarchy doesn't it?  That makes a lot of sense to me.  But you don't own her, nor her you.  This is between her, and your stepdad.  There could be some unrealized benefits to this that you have not considered.  One of them is that babies are cute as heck and you'll get to enjoy having a sibling after all this time.  It could be a very satisfying relationship for you -- you're gonna be a BIG SIS!  Try to embrace it.

You can feel how you feel, she should not get mad at you for it.", "NAH.\n\nI would think that even without the past experiences explained, it would be natural for any grown adult to pull a face if their parent tells them they are expecting again.\n\nThere's worry for the parent's wellbeing (40 is considered a geriatric pregnancy with more risks), as well as thought of having a baby sibling that could be mistaken for your own child when out and about.\n\nAnd there's the ick factor, knowing that your parent had sex.", "N A H. You cannot control your face and are allowed your feelings.\n\nBut... YTA.\n\nYour mother was kicked out at 17, had you alone at 19, and worked her butt off to provide for you both.

But you do know she was there, right?", "NTA  \nI was 40 when I got pregnant again, my then 11 & 14yr old also pulled a face when I told them the news LOL However, my almost 13yr old is in love with her little brother.. my almost 16yr old loves him in her own way (She has a tough time with her ASD). You were in initial shock.... I guess she was looking for more immediate support and enthusiasm.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou're allowed to feel any way you like about this, but making a face when someone tell you they're pregnant is pretty shit.\n\nI also get it's a reflex and maybe not something you could help in the moment.\n\nAnd your mother sounds like she tried her best, she was thrown out of home and worked a lot, so you didn't see her much.\n\nShe worked for you then and is still working for you now, considering she pays half your rent and bills even though you're an adult.\n\nI think you owe her a phone call and an apology.\n\nReddit loves to demonise parents. A parent misses one school play and they're dicks forever. In reality they're people struggling just like everybody else and you don't get to just say \"well, she worked a lot\" and that makes any way you treat her OK.", "NTA\n\nMom needs to realize getting pregnant at 40 has lots of challenges that typical pregnancies don't have. If I was in this situation I'd be asking lots of questions.\n\nIs she aware of complications to her and baby bc of age? Does she have someone to take care of baby incase she passes during their childhood? Does she have a open mind to new social norms? Does she have the ability to raise a disabled child? Does she expect you to have a relationship with the child? \n\nAll these questions are questions she should have answered because not having them answers ends up traumatizing the kid. My mom had me at 40 too and because of that I have lots of impairments, disabilities and disorders that neither of my parents are willing to help me with (partially because of age partially because of not adjusting to social norms)\n\nAnother side effect is that both my siblings have crazy age gaps (12 & 15) causing me to have more of a parental relationship with either of them rather than a sibling relationship. I'm closer in age to my nephew than my sister, obviously I won't be able to bond with them as much as my parents had hoped. Same thing with extended family. They're all adults, mostly elderly with cousins being in their late 20's early 30's. Because of my parents decision to have me late I had a very lonely childhood.

You apologized and she acknowledged that she has to think about the situation it further.", "NTA. From the sounds of it it was just your gut instinct. Most people don\u2019t have 21 year age gaps between kids and while she\u2019s still relatively young it\u2019s still unusual. Surprise and confusion would be a normal gut instinct. And you\u2019re allowed to feel you didn\u2019t get a great childhood and now your sibling will. That\u2019s completely valid.

Can understand that mom was disappointed not to have you be excited, but as someone who dealt with similar in the last couple years with both my dad and my mom, I can also understand making a face. I\u2019d guess that you would want the best for your mom and the coming new baby, but it\u2019s natural to be knee-jerk upset/disappointed that a new sibling - that you\u2019re old enough to be mistaken as the parent of - will get to grow up with what you didn\u2019t, and that\u2019s okay! You apologized and neither side escalated things.\n\nAs an add-on, a therapist might be a potential option to help you work through your feelings on the matter, too.

Fast forward to the next week she's announcing another pregnancy. I couldn't reconcile the two so instead walked away to collect my thoughts while everyone else love bombed her. Some people make it hard to be happy for them in the moment. It'll take you a while to process the whole thing and you may be pleasantly surprised to find yourself happy for her when all is said and done.

And OP also said she hopes to pay her mother back once she\u2019s in a better place financially after university. That alone shows she\u2019s not using her mother financially or trying to punish her for her childhood experience, despite the mother saying it\u2019s to makeup for it.
