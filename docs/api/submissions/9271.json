Some people don't want kids, and they keep it because they don't want an abortion, or they are on their way to abortion but not super trilled about it.

My step-nephew did the wtf faces then walked out when he found out he'd have his first sibling at 20 yo. Things turned out fine though he just needed to process and has been a very good big brother. Same with you, you need to process and I bet you will love baby. Your mom just probably expected a happy reaction.", "NAH. You couldn't exactly control your immediate reaction, but it wasn't your mother's fault either.

She wanted to think and left without escalating. Maybe reach out sometime in the next few days if she doesn't.

She\u2019s probably just internalising her own feelings rather than your face expressions being the root cause. NTA", "YTA.

It is not your mother's fault she had to do all that. Your father left. It's not fair what happened to her and neither is your harsh point of view (but it is understandable because you're only 20).

It\u2019s okay to have some negative feelings with news like this that brings up traumatic memories for you, but you are in control of how you visibly react.

It's normal for young adults to feel resentful of the ways they can see they have been inadequately raised. We all at that age see our parents' flaws. But as we age and face similar problems we realize what a heavy lift that would have been for a single woman barely out of her teens to provide for and raise a child alone. It's too early for that, so in the meantime, make your apology sincere and offer to help her, just as she is helping you.", "For someone who claims she was trying to be brief, your post sure was long.

I get why you pulled a face! No doubt! Plus you apologized, which was cool. Give her time to cool down sweetie. But I really want you to understand and appreciate it that she was working instead of staying home and living off the government all your life. Plus she took the time off to go to your events. I really don\u2019t understand your resentment about that. What I DO understand is the whole age gap , the difference in her feelings about wanting another child now as opposed to before. \n\nMaybe just be happy that\u2019s she\u2019s happy and May not have to worry so much anymore and can finally relax for once in her life. May you be so lucky in your own life and not have it as hard as she did at such a young age", "You really can't help an involuntary reflex and I understand where it came from. I'm pretty sure there's quite a lot of resentment and jealousy there. I can imagine that you see that this baby is going to get everything that you couldn't from your mother. I may have felt the same way at 21 as I am also from a poor single mother who worked multiple jobs to get by.\n\nI do think that you probably could have judged the situation better. You probably know your mother more than anybody else so you would know how she felt about this pregnancy when she told you by how she presented it. I would suggest you reach out to your mother. You need to talk this over with your mother because you are holding on to a lot of resentment over something she couldn't help.

YTA...she is allowed to live her life. She lived it for you all those years", "NAH! I know how this feels, and man it is such a bizarre, kinda lonely feeling. After years of neglect, seeing your mom heal and then become pregnant, possibly getting a bit of a retry with a new baby, it can feel almost like you\u2019re being replaced. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean your mom is at fault for being pregnant, but your feelings are totally understandable", "NAH  \nMy youngest sibling is 21 years younger than me.  I remember the shock when it was announced. My parents were too young when they had me, and I was pretty much on my own early on.  I was responsible for taking care of every younger sibling, so by the time the youngest came along I was done.  Your mom has every right to have more children, but you are entitled to your feelings.  Not sure what she is expecting, but you likely won't be living together so it won't be a \"typical\" sibling relationship.  \n\n\nIf it were me, I'd let her know that you were just shocked by the announcement, and hope she is happy.  I'd then go about my life as I planned.   Don't commit to babysitting :)", "NAH\n\nSometimes people trash talk things they desperately want, because there is no way for them to get the experience they want at that moment.\n\nFor example, my mom talked so much shit about McMansions.  Called them immoral and talked specifically about a particular set up as just bad parenting and \"evil.\"  I thought it was dramatic, but she was free to have her opinions.\n\nYeah.  Her finances changed, and she bought her \"dream house.\" Which... Had exactly everything that she'd ever claimed to hate.\n\nWhen I first responded with surprise and confusion, she was extremely upset.  Like being surprised was somehow judgement that she didn't deserve the things she wanted and had worked for.\n\nYour mom wanted the experience of motherhood without constantly working for survival.  She wanted to spend time with you and wanted another kid too.  She wanted to have a partner on that journey, and now she does.\n\nJust as she couldn't say before that she desperately wanted some things in life (more time to be a mom, a partner, etc), she can't say now why your surprise hurts.  People don't always make sense.  You weren't malicious in being surprised, and she isn't wrong for chasing what she wants.  Communication is hard sometimes.", "NTA. You are fully entitled to your feelings, and have very valid reasons for them as well. My suggestion would be to look into therapy. I\u2019ve seen this type of scenario play out a few times, and what often happens is the mother is in a completely different place in their lives having the second child, so naturally how they parent the second child is much different. What often happens is the older child then watches the younger get all the things they never had and missed out on. Basically they get the \u201cnew and improved\u201d mom, while the older one watches from the sidelines feeling hurt and resentful. Those are natural feelings I think anyone would feel in that situation. My advice is to try and find forgiveness and do your best to work through the emotions healthily otherwise they can eat you up and cause you a lot of pain. No matter what try and stay mindful the child is innocent in it all.", "NAH, unplanned kids happen, your reaction was a reflex. just try to be positive with your mom she might need emotional support during this.", "NTA", "Yes, YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom sacrificed for years so that you wouldn't live in poverty.   And your post reeks of resentment for her \"not being around\".    Well, FU!   She \"wasn't around\" because she was trying to provide a life FOR YOU, you ungrateful child.\n\nNot only that, but now she is paying half your rent and bills?  \n\n\nYou have an INCREDIBLE mom, that you simply don't appreciate enough.\n\nNow, she finally has a partner in life and comes to you with what she considers to be very happy news - and your reaction isn't joy and \"I'm so happy for you, mom!\" it is to make a face?  \n\n\nYou're a ungrateful and miserable brat.    \"YTA\" seems too mild of a description.", "NTA.

I\u2019ve kinda settled on saying, \u201cCongratulations???\u201d with an obvious question mark in my voice, so people can either nod and indicate they\u2019re happy or shake their heads no in which case I can follow up with an appropriate condolence/apology.  But I feel it\u2019s still less than ideal.\n\nUs socially inept people probably don\u2019t want to say anything wrong just as much as you don\u2019t want to hear it!  We\u2019re trying our hardest, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a standard response that we can use in all situations.

You\u2019d have to appropriately modulate your voice while saying it.  You have to be able to strike that correct neutral tone because you can easily mess it up by saying it \u201ctoo happily\u201d (could be perceived as being congratulatory) or \u201ctoo knowingly\u201d (could be perceived as some kind of insult about their appearance/attitude as if they\u2019ve been looking/acting poorly and now you know why) or \u201ctoo negatively\u201d (implying that of course pregnancy was a hardship or trial and causing offense that way.)\n\nAt least saying , \u201cCongratulations???\u201d is easier, because all you have to do is make that rising noise at the end of the word, not make sure the words themselves have a certain emotion.\n\nThat might seem silly to you, but honest to god I have to think about stuff like that.  I\u2019ve gotten a lot of unintended reactions over the course of my life because I say things \u201cthe wrong way\u201d even if the words are right.  It\u2019s worse because I\u2019m a woman.  I think people tend to give men a pass as long as they\u2019re in the correct ballpark because men are seen as more emotionally inept in general, but a woman is expected to be good at emotions and social interactions.

My comment is only valid when you are unsure. If someone yells IM PREGNANT while jumping up and down, the question is obviously not necessary :)", ">Your questions are so far out of the norm\n\n\"Out of the norm\" doesn't mean \"bad\". It means people are progressing. 100 years ago, women were meant to have kids, that was basically their \"only purpose\", so yeah, being pregnant was the normal thing any women should do. Nowadays, it's not. It's normal that our views on pregnancy evolve.\n\n>they imply the baby isn't or shouldn't be wanted.\n\nNo, they imply that people are allowed to not want children, and that I don't pretend to know what their views on having kid should be.\n\n>They're inherently judgy in a negative way,\n\nI feel like it's the other way around. When someone comes with this new, saying \"congratulations\" is rude because you are implying that they SHOULD BE HAPPY no matter what. Asking them if they are happy is taking into consideration that not every one wants kids, and that you respect their decision. \n\n>Source: am pregnant.\n\nMy source : A friend in college got pregnant on a REAL bad luck (i.e. broken condom). It was not an easy situation for her. She had her abortion planned right in the middle of an exam. When she went to the teacher to explain why she would need to miss the exam, the teacher didn't even let her finish and told her \"CONGRATULATIONS!!!!\" and it just... made the situation way worst for everyone.\n\nSo yeah, different people, different views. When in doubt, asking a question is NOT rude.", "Theoretically you should be able to tell whether it's good news or not by the way it's delivered. If you overlook that and ask if they're happy regardless of the delivery, that's where the judginess comes in. Usually, people don't announce their unwanted pregnancies to people that don't know them well enough to make this call. \nAnother poster's idea of \"wow! How are you feeling?\" is perfect."]}
