She wanted to think and left without escalating. Maybe reach out sometime in the next few days if she doesn't.

It is not your mother's fault she had to do all that. Your father left. It's not fair what happened to her and neither is your harsh point of view (but it is understandable because you're only 20).

It's normal for young adults to feel resentful of the ways they can see they have been inadequately raised. We all at that age see our parents' flaws. But as we age and face similar problems we realize what a heavy lift that would have been for a single woman barely out of her teens to provide for and raise a child alone. It's too early for that, so in the meantime, make your apology sincere and offer to help her, just as she is helping you.", "For someone who claims she was trying to be brief, your post sure was long.

I get why you pulled a face! No doubt! Plus you apologized, which was cool. Give her time to cool down sweetie. But I really want you to understand and appreciate it that she was working instead of staying home and living off the government all your life. Plus she took the time off to go to your events.

I may have felt the same way at 21 as I am also from a poor single mother who worked multiple jobs to get by.\n\nI do think that you probably could have judged the situation better. You probably know your mother more than anybody else so you would know how she felt about this pregnancy when she told you by how she presented it. I would suggest you reach out to your mother. You need to talk this over with your mother because you are holding on to a lot of resentment over something she couldn't help.

After years of neglect, seeing your mom heal and then become pregnant, possibly getting a bit of a retry with a new baby, it can feel almost like you\u2019re being replaced. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean your mom is at fault for being pregnant, but your feelings are totally understandable", "NAH  \nMy youngest sibling is 21 years younger than me.  I remember the shock when it was announced. My parents were too young when they had me, and I was pretty much on my own early on.  I was responsible for taking care of every younger sibling, so by the time the youngest came along I was done.  Your mom has every right to have more children, but you are entitled to your feelings.  Not sure what she is expecting, but you likely won't be living together so it won't be a \"typical\" sibling relationship.  \n\n\nIf it were me, I'd let her know that you were just shocked by the announcement, and hope she is happy.  I'd then go about my life as I planned.   Don't commit to babysitting :)", "NAH\n\nSometimes people trash talk things they desperately want, because there is no way for them to get the experience they want at that moment.\n\nFor example, my mom talked so much shit about McMansions.  Called them immoral and talked specifically about a particular set up as just bad parenting and \"evil.\"  I thought it was dramatic, but she was free to have her opinions.\n\nYeah.  Her finances changed, and she bought her \"dream house.\" Which... Had exactly everything that she'd ever claimed to hate.\n\nWhen I first responded with surprise and confusion, she was extremely upset.  Like being surprised was somehow judgement that she didn't deserve the things she wanted and had worked for.\n\nYour mom wanted the experience of motherhood without constantly working for survival.  She wanted to spend time with you and wanted another kid too.  She wanted to have a partner on that journey, and now she does.\n\nJust as she couldn't say before that she desperately wanted some things in life (more time to be a mom, a partner, etc), she can't say now why your surprise hurts.  People don't always make sense.  You weren't malicious in being surprised, and she isn't wrong for chasing what she wants.  Communication is hard sometimes.", "NTA. You are fully entitled to your feelings, and have very valid reasons for them as well. My suggestion would be to look into therapy. I\u2019ve seen this type of scenario play out a few times, and what often happens is the mother is in a completely different place in their lives having the second child, so naturally how they parent the second child is much different. What often happens is the older child then watches the younger get all the things they never had and missed out on. Basically they get the \u201cnew and improved\u201d mom, while the older one watches from the sidelines feeling hurt and resentful. Those are natural feelings I think anyone would feel in that situation. My advice is to try and find forgiveness and do your best to work through the emotions healthily otherwise they can eat you up and cause you a lot of pain. No matter what try and stay mindful the child is innocent in it all.", "NAH, unplanned kids happen, your reaction was a reflex. just try to be positive with your mom she might need emotional support during this.", "NTA", "[removed]", "NTA.

I feel like, \u201cSo, should I be saying congratulations or not?\u201d can be perceived as pushy and intrusive.

You\u2019d have to appropriately modulate your voice while saying it.  You have to be able to strike that correct neutral tone because you can easily mess it up by saying it \u201ctoo happily\u201d (could be perceived as being congratulatory) or \u201ctoo knowingly\u201d (could be perceived as some kind of insult about their appearance/attitude as if they\u2019ve been looking/acting poorly and now you know why) or \u201ctoo negatively\u201d (implying that of course pregnancy was a hardship or trial and causing offense that way.)\n\nAt least saying , \u201cCongratulations???\u201d is easier, because all you have to do is make that rising noise at the end of the word, not make sure the words themselves have a certain emotion.\n\nThat might seem silly to you, but honest to god I have to think about stuff like that.

My mother spend many nights working (from home, after she finished working at her workplace, because her role involved \"homework\", effectively), so I didn't get to just hang out with her then either. \n\nBut, my mother was also *married*, with an entire family/support network to fall back on, and childcare/childminders/babysitters. She was also older and married when she had me and my siblings. So please consider how much harder it was for your mother, when she had you at *19*, was kicked out by her family before that, and was a single mother. That's *why* she worked so hard. For YOU. \n\nI get how it feels when other kids have their mum at the nativity play and you don't. I get how it feels when your mum can't spend time with you at home in the evenings because she has to work. \n\nBut she was doing the best she could for you, under difficult circumstances. Also, if she hadn't worked so hard back *then*, I doubt your mother could be paying half your rent/bills *now*. \n\nSometimes our plans change when our circumstances change. Some people insist they'll never marry, then meet someone they *want* to marry. Some people can't fathom moving away from the place they grew up in, until an opportunity presents itself (like a job offer or something). \n\nCut her a little slack.", "Yes u are the ah", "YTA your mother is a woman who sacrificed decades for you to grow up safely and fed and cared for.
