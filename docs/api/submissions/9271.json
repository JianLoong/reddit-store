She didn't escalate the situation more and left.  You already apologized.  That's the end of it.", "NAH. Of course you are going to do \"a face\", your childhood was crap, and your mom stated she didn't want another child, so it was fair enough to think this child might be a mistake and your mom might not want it.\n\nI am kinda tired of the whole \"congratulations!!\" when someone says they are pregnant. Some people don't want kids, and they keep it because they don't want an abortion, or they are on their way to abortion but not super trilled about it. It should be universal that when in doubt, ask the person first if this baby is wanted or not and ask if they are happy about it before congratulating.", "NAH", "NAH", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to feel any way you want about this. That is big, shocking news and I don't think I'd be overly thrilled about it either, but ultimately it's your moms decision. She definitely does sound like she's in a much better place to have a child and provide for it, but it doesn't mean you have to be thrilled about it.", "NTA. Your reaction was involuntary and understandable, and you apologized.", "NAH. You reacted, but you didn't double down.", "NAH", "NTA\n\nYou didn't even say anything. Demanding a particular facial expression in reaction to certain news is ridiculous. You're right to feel weirded out by this. I don't even know your mom, and I made a face.", "NTA With that age gap I can see a lot of reflexive faces. You didn't say anything negative I hope cause it's her choice.  My step-nephew did the wtf faces then walked out when he found out he'd have his first sibling at 20 yo. Things turned out fine though he just needed to process and has been a very good big brother. Same with you, you need to process and I bet you will love baby. Your mom just probably expected a happy reaction.", "NAH. You couldn't exactly control your immediate reaction, but it wasn't your mother's fault either. She was understandably in a very tight spot money-wise when she had you and made the best of what she had, so she can't be begrudged the opportunities now.", "NAH\n\nInvoluntary reaction that you apologized for. She wanted to think and left without escalating. Maybe reach out sometime in the next few days if she doesn't. I think it's totally understandable to be hesitant, but since things have changed and she's also actively trying to make things up to you at the same time, being supportive will be your best bet.", "NAH\n\nOf course you were shocked. Send her a baby gift with a card saying sorry for your shocked reaction. If she's happy, you can be happy for her. Right....?", "NAH. Your reaction was completely understandable. I\u2019m sure with additional thought you can see why it\u2019s offensive - most of all because your mom sacrificed loads to raise you on her own. ***But you apologized.***\n\nYour mom was right to be offended, and also deserves the opportunity to think fast (be offended) and think slowly (think it over and accept your apology).", "NAH, it's a natural reaction but probably not what she wanted to hear. but then she also didnt escalate? so NAH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmaybe a word of caution to start preparing yourself for your mom to take this baby as her second chance to \"do it right\" and start being the mom you wanted her to be, to this baby. if she does that, she probably isn't doing it \\*at\\* you but it will create a lot of feelings in you. consider exploring therapy to help you process it all.", "YTA. Seems like the person you should be blaming for your childhood situation is your deadbeat father.  Your mother stayed in the middle of it, worked to provide (and is still providing for you as an adult). You're pretty ungrateful.\n\nThe proper reaction to someone announcing their engagement/wedding/pregnancy is \"Congratulations\" or \"You must be so happy\" or whatever. In your mother's case it sounds like she has a better relationship now and you should be glad for her.", "YTA\n\nYou're an adult. Quit being immature and raining on your mom's news out of jealousy", "I think your face expression might have made her question if maybe it\u2019s such a good idea after all, because after saying she didn\u2019t want more kids and then getting pregnant at 40, of course it\u2019s going to be a bit of a shock, it\u2019s not something you expected. She\u2019s probably just internalising her own feelings rather than your face expressions being the root cause. NTA", "YTA. It sounds like you hurt her feelings and made an insincere apology, and now you're not speaking. You need to be the one to reach back out.", "Soft YTA - Not for the involuntary reaction as some people have expressive faces, but more for the way you wrote about your mother. \n\nI think you should have more compassion for her situation. Sounds like she\u2019s done her best to provide for you and you sound a bit ungrateful. \n\nHope things go well for her and it sounds like her situation has improved. My mom had me at 41 with no issues.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI am a completely different parent to my older kids than my youngest. There's a decent age gap and I had my first 2 at 19&21.\n\nMaybe she didn't want to raise another kid by herself. Single parenting is hard. Maybe she got married to a good partner and decided another kid was for her.\n\nYou can have an opinion on the baby, but you don't get to be a butt head about it... And she doesn't have to take your opinion seriously. \n\nSend her a gift. Apologize. Tell her that you're happy for them if they are happy. And then be as involved or not as you want.", "Soft YTA - I understand it must be hard for you to know this new baby will have what you always wanted, but you're almost an adult now. \nNo it wasn't a roommate situation when your mother was the parent who stayed, raised you alone, made sure to provide for you while being able to be present for big events etc... It is not your mother's fault she had to do all that. Your father left. It's not fair what happened to her and neither is your harsh point of view (but it is understandable because you're only 20). She deserves to be happy, and if this new baby is a happy news for them then be happy for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Realize that her being happy with her current life now doesn't mean that she wasn't happy with you, she's just in a much different place as are you and you two are going to see things differently and you're feelings for having a less than ideal childhood is valid too.\n\nHonestly you two should sit down and have an actual conversation about your feelings, your childhood, her parenthood, and your relationship going forward.", "NTA just be very careful here that she doesn't decide you are going to raise it. That you have to lose going into school or work to take care of her child. Make sure you express your boundaries well before the baby is born. You are an adult now. You can pull faces when feeling emotion without a parent trying to punish you for it.", "YTA. It sounds like your mom did the best she could given the situation and the fact that your bio father left. You didn\u2019t have an ideal childhood, that\u2019s true, but whether or not your mom has a baby now doesn\u2019t affect that. It\u2019s okay to have some negative feelings with news like this that brings up traumatic memories for you, but you are in control of how you visibly react. You can talk to your mom about those feelings later, without making her feel bad about her happy news now.\n\nBtw, I\u2019ve never had a roommate who took time off for my school events or paid half my living expenses.", "Gentle YTA Your reaction was childish and based on resentment. It's normal for young adults to feel resentful of the ways they can see they have been inadequately raised. We all at that age see our parents' flaws. But as we age and face similar problems we realize what a heavy lift that would have been for a single woman barely out of her teens to provide for and raise a child alone. It's too early for that, so in the meantime, make your apology sincere and offer to help her, just as she is helping you.", "For someone who claims she was trying to be brief, your post sure was long. All you had to say was that you made a face because your mom told you she was pregnant. Your post could\u2019ve been literally one sentence lol.", "Very soft YTA. You should apologize and tell her you were just surprised at the thought of having a sibling 20 years younger than you.", "I 100000% agree....  do whatever you can to support mom", "You said it MUCH better than I did... I wish I could upvote twice"]}
