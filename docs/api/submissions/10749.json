The sign on the door says, \u201cNo WiFI, No Lap Tops\u201d.  They serve great coffee and I always can find a seat. People come and go.

Being mentally prepared to have someone get all this stuff out might have eased the chaos. \n\nMaybe you could have handled it somewhat nicer in retrospect - suggesting that they sketch or paint more simply. Such retrospect things don't come to me in a moment, at work.\n\nYou are nta though. You did a good job, and that person needs to exercise better judgement somehow. No one really sucks here, it's just an unfortunate situation and activity. We also need more \"third spaces\", which shops sadly are not.\n\n*I would still try to make an extra point to be nice, comment on what art things you'd enjoy seeing her do at the shop.

Coffee gets spilled all the time and paint does as well. The canvas could slip off the table facedown. A customer could walk by at the wrong moment and get paint on them from her brush.

If she had tonnes of open tubes of paint and a large palette, a bunch of paintbrushes, then I could see it looking like a messy situation in the making. But it's very possible to paint tidily, and it sounds like she came prepared to do so, as you didn't notice her painting initially, and she had protected the table. \n\nPersonally I think it's slightly BS to prevent someone who is a good, nice, regular customer from doing an activity because it might possibly be messy. Especially as we all know that kids are the messiest thing you can bring into a cafe, and they're in all the time! (I say this as both a mum and someone who has worked in cafes most her life).", "What are you on about?", "NTA that is not an appropriate activity for a coffee shop. It\u2019s just not.

For this I say NTA.", "NAH. It's a compliment to you that she sees your cafe as a peaceful place to be creative. It doesn't sound like she intended to be disruptive.

You extinguished someone's light.", "NAH but you probably just lost a regular customer.", "NAH.

She made an assumption, was wrong, was confronted, and left quietly without a fuss.", "Even though she was cautious of her surroundings, other people might not and can bump into her table/space. You can do the absolute most to cover your area but any movement can cause them to spill. I assume she also had paint water to clean her brushes so that could cause a bigger mess.", "Oh well that changes things then, I thought you were a male", "She seems to know that it\u2019s an activity that requires being extra careful, hence the newspapers. It\u2019s basic courtesy to ask for permission to do a higher risk activity if said risk could effects someone else. \n\n\u201cLeft quietly without a fuss\u201d.  I think you mean minimal fuss.

However NTA.", "I have a mildly autistic female friend that does this places, it always stresses me out that an interaction like this will occur and I felt so awful to ask her not to paint until after we eat and go home.NTA, I also feel like art supplies are messy and not great for a restaurant.", "Nah but you could\u2019ve told her she can sketch and use other materials art wise, just not paint", "NTA. If you let one person paint, then another - not so careful artist will expect to paint as well.", "Yeah, no. Painting in a coffee shop is not on. Colored pencils exist. NTA.", "NAH, but I guess I wonder why it was such an issue if she's never been a problem before and wasn't actually causing a problem now.", "NTA that is to much of a liability, I don\u2019t care how careful you are", "NTA if you care about her custom you could have a look if there is somewhere close by more appropriate for her the paint and let her know next time you see her.", "NAH. Though I can understand her predicament this is a place of business. How much soave was she taking, for how long? I saw someone mention a sketch book. That seems more in line with this type of environment. Maybe if she comes back you will get the chance to suggest that.", "Exactly, a business owner or manager has a responsibility to manage the environment for ALL their customers' well-being. If she comes back OP, perhaps you could tell her that bringing a sketchbook to draw in would be okay? Because she sounds like a nice customer and it would help reassure her that you are still happy to have her and her (nonmessy) art there.", "art paint's not gonna smell unless it's oil based. it's not like throwing a gallon of latex paint up on the walls of a room. but uh, yeah, still not wise to bring a messy medium like that into an establishment. all clothes become painting clothes, and so all surfaces become painting surfaces.", "I've seen people sketch or do watercolors in coffee shops (using very small containers of water unlikely to spill), but not paint with anything that goes on canvas. But I agree OP was well within their rights to ask her not to paint. As others mentioned, it might have been nice to offer that she was welcome to come back with a sketchbook.\n\nIf OP has artwork in the coffee shop, they might consider offering to take a look at any finished paintings of the young artist and hang them in the shop to be sold. I know some coffee shops do this for local artists and take a small percentage of the sale. Just a thought.", "LOL you're joking, right?", "Right, because she normally came in with large groups of friends?  At least he won't loose dozens and dozens of people who find the smell of paint makes the coffee and pastries less appetizing, so there's that.", "LOL", "[deleted]", "Since she was painting on canvas it was either oil paint or acrylic/laytex based-- both have unpleasant odors (and in the case of oil toxic solvents).  What happens if a patron brushes against the palette or she drops a brush?  If she wants to work inside in a business she should get a sketchbook and pencils and draw.", "I agree a sketchbook or something like that would be fine, and that\u2019s a nice idea to offer a gallery space.  The art association I belong to has relationships like that with a few community buildings and local restaurants, and it\u2019s worked out very well for everyone.  A coffee shop would be a great place for something like that.\n\nIf OP feels bad about it, I wonder if they could look into other potential painting places for this girl. Community center, art guild, etc.  maybe there\u2019s an afterschool club, or she could suggest one at her school. I hope she finds an appropriate and calm place to paint.", "Acrylics actually have a sort of ammonia smell and gouache has a sort of sour milk smell that always made me gag bag in art school.", "I have a sensitive nose and everything but watercolor smells to me. I do oils and acrylics, as well as spray paint art for fun and it's all so smelly. I assume she just had a little water color tin though.", "But water color is literally the easiest paint to clean up. I mean if your palm is moist enough you could rub it off a smooth surface.", "What brand of acrylics are you using? I've never noticed an ammonia smell, and I've been painting with mainly acrylics for almost a decade now.", "I think you were fair, but if you wanted to do something nice, you could tell her one day a month you\u2019re willing to host an \u201cevent\u201d IE set up a plastic table and let her paint, on condition she paints you something someday.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t make you the jerk if you didn\u2019t do that, you were well within your rights, but it sounds like you have an artsy coffee shop, so that\u2019s totally on brand and you could pick an off day (who knows, maybe it\u2019ll end with a real event picking up)", "Liquitex and occasionally Windsor Newton.", "Acrylic isn't always easy to clean up depending on the surface.   You made the right decision and sounds like you were very kind to the young woman.

This girl was going to take up a table for hours and stink up the whole cafe with chemical smells.

I bring baby wipes and my own water and don\u2019t even use the bathroom sinks to rinse anything. It all fits in a tote bag. \n\nI honestly think if she hadn\u2019t been so careful with the newspaper you wouldn\u2019t have noticed anymore than if she\u2019d been sketching or coloring. Being in a coffee shop with a toddler is WAY WAY WAY messier than a solo adult being careful with a quiet craft. \n\nNAH because it\u2019s your business, run it how you see fit, but I think you overreacted. And all the N T A votes because \u201caccidents happen\u201d \u2026 yeah, they do, and I get it if she came in with a whole damn easel, but people can also bump into tables with food and drinks on them and messes happen that way? Like\u2026 food is also messy? \n\nY\u2019all need a hobby.", "YTA but I think you already know that. This regular who never causes problems comes to your place for a quiet spot away from her home and you show her the door because of what MIGHT happen.", "YTA. Such a small thing, letting someone do their art in your space. All these people are saying. ooh, it might spill! Someone is making art. This makes up for the \"mess\". These responders were prevented from making art because those exerting control over their lives were more worried about mess than about allowing them to express their creativity. Give this child a safe place to paint.", "Soft YTA\n\nThe coffee shop in my town has a dude who paints everyday. Never seen an accident when I was in there, and if there is one I'm sure it is easy to clean (most kitchen cleaners could easily get up paints). \n\nAll this talk of \"the paint could spill!\" is blown out of proportion. Accidents happen, that is part of life.", "I won\u2019t give a judgement, but I do feel bad for the girl if she thought a public place was less crazy than her house.  I hope nothing bad is going on for her", "My brain agrees NTA but my heart says YTA as an artist. There are tons of water soluable, odorless paints that are easy to clean up and won't stain smooth surfaces. You literally need just a little moisture to wipe it off. Plus the attention to detail with the newspaper to be extra clean. I used to paint daily in a local Greek restaurant in a german town in NRW and the owner of the restaurant gave me free food because I was bringing in more customers. (I was a very good artist). I stand by NTA, but my heart cries for a fellow artist just looking for a nice, gentle atmosphere to paint and drink coffee.", "That's sad", "I'm the odd one out bc my first thought is you're the AH. My own trauma reared it's head and I imagined this sweet child with a terrible home life just wanting peace. Then you go and make her leave.  The fact that she immediately complied made me more sad for her, but I'm a sucker. I guess technically, you are NTA but it feels mean.", "NAH. I understand why she wanted to come to your place if her home is \"crazy\" and she's a regular, but I also understand why you said she couldn't do it. It's a health hazard.\n\nI'd like for this to end in a feel good way, with you figuring out a way to help a fledgling artist who has a difficult home life and you become a haven for her.... But this isn't a lifetime movie, and you don't have to do that. You wouldn't even be an asshole if you didn't.", "NAH. I understand you were worried about your shop, and I also understand why she would want to paint there. I love writing in coffee shops. There\u2019s just an aura about them. She probably figured she was being careful but you weren\u2019t wrong per se. \nShe may have been a model customer, but it sets an example, so others who are not as careful or responsible might assume they can paint there too. I feel really sad for her, but I also really get your position. I hope she is able to find a safe inspiring spot for her art.", "Sigh. I don't think you were the asshole here, but I feel for the girl who felt safe and comfortable in the space you created and was told to leave. \n\nI know hindsight is 20/20 and all that, but if you ever see her again, consider thanking her for choosing your place, and explaining your concerns. Let her know that you would be fine with pencil, marker, etc but paint is just not a good mix in a place like this.", "Technically not an AH, but I still feel it was an AH move. Ppl draw, paint, write, go on laptops, knit or crochet, etc all the time at coffee shops. \n\n\nFood and coffee can also be considered messy, kids are messy, animals messy and I see all of those things in coffee shops. \n\n\nIt's also winter so it's not like she could just pop out to the park and paint. Iunno man, disappointing cuz you could've been supportive but chose not to be.. which is your prerogative but also says a bit about you as a person. \n\nCoffee shops have also been \"the place\" to hang for hobbies/meets/whatever and not only did u push her away but anyone else she shares her experience with too, all it would've taken was a baby wipe to clean it up if she spilled something.", "NAH. This sounds like a pretty normal interaction to me. You weren't comfortable with her painting in your coffee shop, so she went to paint somewhere else. Although, the house thing is a little concerning- Is there a park nearby or something?", "NTA, she needs to understand that she should do that somewhere else, where she's the only one responsible for potential mess or damage.", "I'm gonna go with NAH. I know she tried to argue, but she did left without making a scene, and I won't blame her for trying in the first place. And you are of course not to blame either.", "NAH I really hope her home isn't super bad though. To go out to a cafe while it's snowy just to escape? Idk. Maybe she'll come back with just a sketchbook next time. I remember when I was younger I used to go out to cafes or mcdonalds just to feel at ease from a hectic household, though I never brought a whole paint set, just a sketchbook", "NAH.", "NTA... she needed to ask first.", "As an artist that frequently colors and draws at my favorite cafe, though I understand, it sucks for her.  We find cafes as an escape. However, I find it odd she would bring actual paint to a shop. That is a bit excessive and its different from markers or colored pencils on a sketchbook so I can understand why you asked her to leave. I know many shops that would allow that, but you're entitled to your own boundaries since its your shop. So NTA", "Same, for fuckin real.\n\nI suspect it wasn't oil paints or acrylic as those are hard to travel with.", "Knitting groups are generally not a desirable addition to a coffee shop\u2026 \n\n(Just saying)", "A lot of people short circuit at the potential of a possible problem, no matter how minor.", "I've known artists who will bring a little watercolor sketch pad with small brushes and a palm-sized palette to restaurants with no issues, but if you go bigger or start in with oil/acrylic paints that can cause permanent damage it's a bit much.", "Yup. I like to oil paint and paint thinner fumes are awful.", " I can't imagine being reckless enough to bring oils to a public place where food is.", " I've been painting with mainly acrylics for almost a decade now.", "Disagree, its actually a great travel medium. Especially if you buy a small box of paints where the lid doubles as a palette, and use water filled brushes. Plus it is by design water soluble so incredibly easy to clean up.", "It\u2019s literally water soluble and the easiest to clean. If it were oil or acrylics I can definitely see the concern. Regardless - NTA because the reasons for asking her to put away the paints are valid.", "NGL, I feel the same way about people on their laptops in a cafe. Like, this is a *restaurant*.", "Nothing personal to you and the other person defending it, I never enjoyed working with it.", "This is a great idea. Places like your shop hold painting events all the time like Painting With A Twist. She\u2019s comfortable in the space you\u2019ve created, which should make you feel good.

It's difficult to clean up acryllics. \nBut if you see her again, suggest watercolours to her. They are made to be taken along and paint outdoors. They are easy to clean. Tell her she could bring those. Even better are watercolor pencils.", "Yta.  She wasn\u2019t making a mess and was a regular there.  She will find a friendlier place to spend her money, but you will always be a high-strung heartless person.", "Hope this helps weigh in at all, but I own a coffee shop, and I do art on the side as a hobby/secondary cash source. You're NTA for having your own rules in the shop, but if she's not hurting anyone and was quiet and didn't make a mess, I would've allowed her to stay.\n\nMy cafe is right beside a major art university and art galleries so it's almost certain I'm going to see mostly art students, but sometimes coffee shops are their only place to do art. \n\nI've spoken and gotten to know many of my customers and several of them live in tiny dorms or have so much family drama/roommate situations where it's just hard to draw. They're also some of my nicest, quietest and most respectful customers, and I'd much rather have them over the partying drunk kids who are just looking to ease their hangovers or use the bathroom to vomit. (Cause that happens too often as well.) \n\nBut at the end of the day, it's your rules and you're not in the wrong for doing what you believe in.", "I am an artist, NTA. I actually teach Paint and Sips in businesses and live paint for events. I would never bring paints to a business uninvited. When I do bring paints I have drop cloths and plastic tablecloths. A newspaper will not prevent paints from staining a table. I also have dish soap and paper towels for accidents, which still happen.", "NTA. How big is your shop? If she stays there for even an hour painting and not consuming your products, that\u2019s an hour when that space was unavailable for paying customers.", "NTA\nShe can find other places to paint,\nAnd the paint smell could cause issues with other customers.", "This makes me sad", "NAH\n\nYou aren\u2019t wrong to ask her to stop painting. It\u2019s completely up to you what you will and won\u2019t allow in your coffee shop. But I\u2019m not willing to say she\u2019s an AH for painting there. It sounds like she had a normal response to your request and I\u2019m guessing she won\u2019t return to paint in your shop again.", "Nta....suggest next time a small watercolor sketch bk with waterbrushes and a smaller watercolor palette. Those are a lot neater...maybe she is escaping an toxic home and felt she found her safe place.", "NAH, but maybe you can let her draw in your shop, but not paint, if she ever going to your shop again.", "Ugh. You kicked out a quiet, polite artist?", "NTA- You're only one stumble/unexpected sneeze/child whose parent lets it run wild away from total disaster, and being on here asking if you're TA for not replacing the paints/paying for the clothing ruined/paying a medical bill.", "NTA that\u2019s just weird.  You could risk losing customers who don\u2019t want to smell the paint.", "It was -30C here yesterday. Outside isn't an option everywhere.", "No, there is a huge difference between watercolor and oils or acrylics. She can do watercolor or sketching or line and wash. But I don't think OP is TA for not allowing oils or acrylics. They don't come off with soap and water like watercolor or food.\nThat said maybe she was using watercolor on canvas? In that case I would say OP is TA", "EXACTLY THANK YOU", "I asked her to either stop or paint somewhere else so I suppose the term \"kicking her out\" was harsh \n\nShe chose to leave after that", "All of this can happen with coffee and food ssooooo let's not be dramatic", "Also paint (especially the sort a teenager would be using) is pretty easily removed with a bit of scrubbing", "Exactly! Um there is food and drink, A mess is definitely happening.", "Um no she doesn't, that's a bit excessive. It's a tiny canvas, not a whole easel and what not", "I see what you're getting at but I don't think this is a good comparison. Painting three dimensional objects is far messier than painting on a flat canvas, especially considering the customers visiting the paint your own pottery shop are more likey to be there for a fun experience and are not experienced artists. Paint/glaze for pottery is also likely to be more permanent than whatever type OP's customer was using. And every surface of the pottery shop is covered with flecks of paint because there is no need to be overly careful or neat in such an environment, unlike OP's customer laying down newspaper.", "You know winter exists in some places. It was -30C here the other day.", "it was never stated she was painting other customers?", "The girl was a paying customer. Most people don\u2019t go into a coffee shop and sit at a table only just long enough to gulp down a coffee. She probably bought a coffee (maybe a pastry) and sat there with it while painting. A stay of about an hour is typical for a coffee shop setting - most people linger with friends, work on a laptop, read a book, etc\u2026.", "I wonder whether the local library has a room people could use for that, during certain hours.", "The downvotes on this is sad", "Pencil drawing, watercolor, line and wash, urban sketching, watercolour pencils would all work fine for this, but not acrylics or oils.", "People do all sorts of art in coffee shops. I frequent one where a few art groups meet. It\u2019s a super busy neighborhood place and I have never blinked twice at finding people knitting, drawing, coloring and painting. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a crazy thing to do and I wouldn\u2019t assume that I needed to ask permission to do something quiet, knowing I\u2019d clean up when I was done.", "Her choice to leave makes you NTA. Have a gooder", "Nope. You get acrylic or oil paint on fabric and it's not going to come out so easily. It's just a fact.", "Are you saying she doesn\u2019t need permission to paint first? Because she clearly does seeing how OP literally asked her not to. It\u2019s right there in black and white.", "Well how else will they get stylish coasters?", "What's so funny?", "Water soluble oil paints", "You can use watercolour on canvas. Or gouache.\n\nCraft acrylic paint really doesn't smell tbh.", "Having spent last summer looking for public spaces, they are very limited in my mid-sized community in the US and there's a charge to use them that far exceeds the cost of coffee.  If the owner doesn't want her painting there, that's his right, but many communities are lacking in any sort of available communal indoor space, which may be why she was there.  I had a hard time finding space like the ones your describing and often defaulted to a coffee shop because it's all I could find.", "Smaller libraries don\u2019t have maker spaces. Those are cool but nowhere near universal.", "I think you know knitting, drawing and colouring don\u2019t fall in the same category in this context. It\u2019s about mess. In your honest opinion do you think the art group asked the owners permission first? I used to own a cafe in Australia for ~10 years and I had groups ask me if they could have a book club at our place so I can\u2019t imagine a painting group wouldn\u2019t. \n\nYou keep saying quiet but it\u2019s obviously not about that. OP said it was about mess. Paint is messy. No matter how careful you are, you can\u2019t control others from bumping into you and spilling paint.\n\nIf I needed a car to get to work for a month and you offered me your spare, would you be annoyed if you found I used it to haul a bunch of wet, smelly garbage to the dump? Even if you couldn\u2019t notice afterwards because I cleaned it up. Would you expect me to ask for special permission for that?", "I'd say it but you'd take offense, then report me so I would be banned. Let's just say youre.....not a nice person", "I know people camp at coffee shops to do work or read etc but this is simply too far. Don\u2019t sweat it", "This. \u2018Third places\u2019 that allow minors and aren\u2019t dedicated to a single activity are rare. Home isn\u2019t always supportive, work or school is\u2026work.", "Don't need to be nice. Just working towards an even future for women \u263a\ufe0f", "I wouldn't do acrylics though. Watercolour or gouache would be a great idea though.", "Then when are we gonna make up 50% of the homicides, burglaries, and rapes? Equality,  amitite?? 50/50!!  We gotta do our fair share as WOMEN!!!", "Well mostly women just need to be in charge for a while now. Males were for centuries and now the time has come for males to surrender to women and be controlled by them to even it all out for our future", "YTA, people are saying you aren\u2019t because you have the right to tell her no, but having the right, doesn\u2019t make you right. She surely would have cleaned up after herself and she just wanted somewhere safe and warm. Sometimes people really just need someone to be kind to them and you were not. Asshole.", "You can always talk to her about setting some rules for her to continue if you see her again and you have regrets about telling her to leave.", "Nta but you coulda let her stay..that would have been a nice thing to do", "Nta\nI got enough watching college /high school students study in McDonald's or Starbucks in my country and now 'canvas and painting'? That's too much. Reading or using laptop/ipad is OK.. But full blow table with work sheets, book and stationery?? \nWish some managers can think like you.", "NAH. You have a right to keep your property clean. She has a right to paint in a quiet place(she probably lives in an abusive home). Also she didn't seem to rebel too much.", "NTA\n\nThey do make watercolor pencils though. They look like colored pencils, but aftER you\u2019re  done, you use a wet brush to make The drawing look like it was painted.", "normally ur meant to ask beforehand NTA", "NAH\n\nI\u2019ve seen people paint in local coffee shops before and it hasn\u2019t been an issue. Especially since most people painting are using watercolors which are really easy to clean up should there be a spill and compact. \n\nBut, you are the manager there so I don\u2019t think it is unreasonable to refuse service to anyone who you think may cause trouble. I can certainly see it being a problem if the teen was using oils or had a cumbersome setup.\n\nHaving said that, loosen up imo. Why not kick her out WHEN (if) it becomes a problem. She seems very polite. Having artists in a coffee shop adds a cool, positive ambience to the environment imo.", "I just came here to say... I think is so very sad you kicked the art girl from your coffee shop. The same way someone can spill a coffee at any time, but most people dont, were the same chances she had for spilling her paint.... \n\nIts so frustrating to be an artist and not javing a plave to do so... \n\nWe are not welcome at libraries nor museums, some cafes might take us... But if her home is super disruptive and she was looking for a place to do her thing.... \n\nShe even put a little newspaper... I feel sorry for the poor girl. \n\nIn all due honesty... I do think you were drowning in a cup of water because she might spill something. And maybe if she did... She would be the first to clean... \n\nMaybe she was painting with goauche, or acrilics or watercolor which are water based paints and easy to clean ...\n\nJust my 2 cents", "NTA\n\nThough I can imagine it's kind of neat for other patrons to see an artist painting. I would certainly watch, if she is engaging/willing to talk at all it could be a neat vibe. \n\nBut ultimately it's your decision.", "I feel sad for her because she doesn\u2019t have an appropriate and safe place to create and express herself. \n\nThe caf\u00e9 isn\u2019t an appropriate place to paint and it\u2019s awful that her home isn\u2019t a restful and safe environment.", "Honestly, get a $1 vinyl tablecloth that\u2019s washable and keep it there for the girl\u2026 She\u2019s never been a problem and comes in all the time, leave her be", "Did the dude just start painting, or did he  first ask to make sure its cool with the owner of the cafe?", "Also it sounds like you were just really rude about it in general. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking the time to think about your actions and honestly I hope you do feel really badly. I hope she finds a kinder coffee shop to frequent and yours goes out of business. Who on earth would even care? It\u2019s a coffee shop. Messes happen. Definitely YTA", "And you\u2019re the manager not even the owner?? Oh you are soooo the asshole I hope your boss sees this and fires you for being rude to regulars.", "As an artist who loves to find little out-of-the-way places to paint, NTA\n\nIf it were pencils, fine, but bringing **paint** inside an unrelated business and setting up is crossing the line. Nobody plans on making a mess, but the potential clean-up is a real concern.\n\nIt's inappropriate to bring projects like that into someone else's place of business. I'm sure you were kind in your approach, but you were NOT the ah here.", "You really shouldn\u2019t be doing anything in a coffee shop that requires laying down newspaper..\n\nOP if you see her again maybe encourage her to sketch or draw at your shop? It sounds like she was respectful, but just didn\u2019t think it through like any teenager could.", "But considering the drying time of oil paints, I suspect she was using a different medium.", "I go to a cafe all the time that's attached to a ceramics studio and people sit and paint ceramics at the tables in the cafe. It's fine and nobody is bothered by the fact people are painting in a place that serves food.\n\nNot saying OP has to allow it in his cafe, but there is nothing inherently wrong with it.", "See this is weird. I bring paper and a few brushes and watercolor paint in coffee shops all the time. There is barely any water, it has never made a mess, and people often comment that it makes the coffee shop feel better - more of an experience. Coffee places with active artists seem to bring in more people because it feels better than a sterile corporate coffee dispensary. I think you did not make the right call here, from a business perspective.", "If you did something totally necessary like this that hurt someone and you still feel bad, you are clearly NTA. You sound like a kind person. Perhaps if she ever comes back, you could express your regret that you had to run her off, and let her know that she is still welcome in your shop (without the paints, lol). She probably feels embarrassed. But even if you don't, you're still in the clear.", "What a wonderful idea! I can imagine this really taking off."]}
