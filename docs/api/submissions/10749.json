It\u2019s not just your property that could get paint on it, someone passing by could accidentally brush against it and that would be an unpleasant drama. I also wonder about the smell, I don\u2019t think paint goes well with coffee and baked goods. She needs to find a park or other more appropriate place.", "NTA.  Setting up your painting isn't something that you go into a shop and do.  It is a great talent and hobby but is something she can either do outside or in her own home.", ">And accidents do happen sometimes. \n\nOne bump to her table and those paints would have gone flying. \nI get why she wanted to do it, but she probably should have asked permission first before setting up.\n\nNAH.", "NAH. You have a right to refuse anyone service for most reasons. It would have been better to have a conversation and come to an agreement, but that was on her to initiate that. You may have lost a regular though, if that matters to you.", "NTA. If she needs a quiet place to do art, how was she expecting to find that in a public space to begin with?", "Let's assume the best possible scenario, where paying attention is enough to perfectly prevent accidents, and she's paying attention.\n\nNext week you have another customer, who looks like they won't pay as much attention, and wants to paint.\n\nNTA", "NAH. I understand why you didn't want her to paint there. She's not an asshole either though.", "I just feel sad for that girl", "NAH - Neither of you were being rude about it, and you're right about accidents that can easily make a huge mess.", "NAH but I think you could\u2019ve gone about it better. Asking why she couldn\u2019t do it at home is just a bit confrontational, and it sounds like she might have problems at home. Her home life ultimately isn\u2019t your issue at all, but that\u2019s just my two cents.", "NAH.\n\nYour concerns were valid and there were other things that could potentially be of concern like paint fumes and all that stuff.  However, while she pled her case to stay, she ultimately left without making a bigger deal out of it so she's fine also.  \n\nNot much more you or her could've done differently to stay on the right side of not being AHs.", "OP, a coffee shop opened near my house. The sign on the door says, \u201cNo WiFI, No Lap Tops\u201d.  They serve great coffee and I always can find a seat. People come and go. I really dislike going to places where people have taken up residence for the day and there is no place to sit.", "NAH. Your concern was valid, and she complied without a fuss.", "NAH I get why you did it and she should have asked if it was ok. However it might make for an idea for an event once in a while at your store. Coffees and knitting\u2026 might be worth approaching other local businesses in area for a collaboration in various crafts.", "NTA or NAH", "NTA, and if she was painting the people at the shop, she should tell them. They deserve to know that they're being recorded, even if it is only on a canvas.", "NAH", "Info: What kind of paint was it? Are we talking pungent smelling and staining oil paints? Or watercolours, which can be cleaned incredibly easily?", "Nta - crazy how entitled people camp out all afternoon after spending a few bucks on a coffee.\n\nYou didn\u2019t need other customers getting painted accidentally.", "You weren't as empathetic as possible, but you were defensive of your own happiness. Unfortunately your shop is not an art lounge equipped to do painting, and it sounds like there wasn't the space to do it in that moment comfortably.\n\nIf she had asked, maybe she would have gained permission. Being mentally prepared to have someone get all this stuff out might have eased the chaos. \n\nMaybe you could have handled it somewhat nicer in retrospect - suggesting that they sketch or paint more simply. Such retrospect things don't come to me in a moment, at work.\n\nYou are nta though. You did a good job, and that person needs to exercise better judgement somehow. No one really sucks here, it's just an unfortunate situation and activity. We also need more \"third spaces\", which shops sadly are not.\n\n*I would still try to make an extra point to be nice, comment on what art things you'd enjoy seeing her do at the shop. This could be a cue to reach out and be all personal, since she is a regular. Maybe she's your next best employee, or a graphic designer about to get hired by the city.  # ramble , but this is an opportunity for empathy from an unfortunate situation.\n\nShould you put up an art bulletin board, like 5 guys does but better?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Although the girl was also not completely in the wrong. She probably should have gone outdoors to paint if she wanted to be somewhere that was not in her house.", "NTA. What you did was reasonable and understandable. You only feel bad because she listened without causing a scene, which is not what would be be a usual response.", "NTA. Accidents happen. Coffee gets spilled all the time and paint does as well. The canvas could slip off the table facedown. A customer could walk by at the wrong moment and get paint on them from her brush. She might not notice paint on her fingers when she's touching her chair. She needs to find another media to use. Pencils, pens and markers would be better. Just not paint.", "NAH but I get why shed want to paint there. The smell of fresh coffee, relaxing music and some peace and quiet. It's too bad paint smells and is messy. Did you really need to escalate to kicking her out. Like did she absolutely refuse to stop?", "I don\u2018t want to smell pain anymore than I want to smell the gawdawful pumpkin spice in my coffee house. NTA", "NTA - But you certainly could have been nice and allowed this polite young lady to paint there.", "There's lots of snow outside so I suspect she wanted someplace warm to paint", "It's a pretty quiant shop and we're always playing soft music but there is the sounds of talking and other people being around", "I\u2019m a professional artist.  It doesn\u2019t matter. Someone with a canvas and paints signals that they\u2019re planning to take up that space for an extended period of time, and that the cafe might play a little fast and lose with dept health regs.  Even those \u201csip and paint\u201d spots don\u2019t have retail food licenses, they\u2019re considered entertainment.  \n\nOP\u2019s business is food service and not co-working studio space.", "Acrylic I belive", "It's very snowy here", "Regardless, something like this is obviously inappropriate at that location.", "And if they don't allow people to sit in with laptops, or women who come in with their babies and spend 4 hours chatting over a pot of tea for 2, then that would be fair. But if they allow that, then it's a little hypocritical.", "That's pretty easy to clean up too. What kind of accident did you think might happen?", "That's what I thought too but I feel a little bad", "Neither of those things make a mess that require newspaper, introduce substances that aren\u2019t appropriate for a restaurant  OR have even occurred in the specific situation outlined in the post.    \n\nSetting up a table of art supplies in a cafe isn\u2019t appropriate and OP has every right to ask them not to do so. And if OP doesn\u2019t want hypothetical moms & babies in there either? Same logic applies.", "I don't know much about painting so I'm not aware what is easy and what's not easy to clean up. Our tables are tall and a little wobbly I was worried paint would tip or drop or smear", "Maybe the noises from your shop are inspiring to her. I would,if she comes in again, take the time and try to strike up a conversation about her wanting to paint in your shop.\nMaybe you discovered a new Toulouse Lautrec,and her paintings will be valuable. \nBut definitely NTA", "Children don't make a mess? I wish parents would put down newspaper before they feed their kids at our cafe. I've had to clean child's vomit off a table, which I would call an inappropriate substance for a restaurant.\n\n>And if OP doesn\u2019t want hypothetical moms & babies in there either? Same logic applies.\n\nAny business can choose to serve who they want. I just said that I thought it was unfair if they allow other customers to make it a working space and bring in lots of mess.", "I think it depends on how she was doing it. If she had tonnes of open tubes of paint and a large palette, a bunch of paintbrushes, then I could see it looking like a messy situation in the making. But it's very possible to paint tidily, and it sounds like she came prepared to do so, as you didn't notice her painting initially, and she had protected the table. \n\nPersonally I think it's slightly BS to prevent someone who is a good, nice, regular customer from doing an activity because it might possibly be messy. Especially as we all know that kids are the messiest thing you can bring into a cafe, and they're in all the time! (I say this as both a mum and someone who has worked in cafes most her life).", "What are you on about?", "NTA that is not an appropriate activity for a coffee shop. It\u2019s just not.  I hope she\u2019s able to find another place though.", "There\u2019s a lot of people saying NAH but I think this is definitely NTA. It\u2019s an unfair assumption that she would be allowed to paint in the shop. She needed to ask permission first, would have probably even worked in her favour if she did. For this I say NTA.", "NAH. It's a compliment to you that she sees your cafe as a peaceful place to be creative. It doesn't sound like she intended to be disruptive. But accidents happen and paint can create a liability. If you see her again, please thank her for her consideration, and maybe find out if she does other types of art that would be more conducive to a cafe environment.", "NTA but you did make the world a sadder, darker place. You extinguished someone's light.", "NAH but you probably just lost a regular customer.", "NAH. You can set limits to what activities happen in your business, and she's allowed to try to find a place to worry in her art.\n\nI do kind of feel bad for her though,  it sounds like she's just looking for a respite from home for some reason.", "Don't worry, she will find another place to buy coffee, and so will her friends, and their friends.", "Nah", "NTA there is a local paint your own pottery shop in my neighborhood. It\u2019s fun but every surface is covered in flecks of paint. That\u2019s not an appropriate activity beyond a space designated for painting. Other mediums are better for a shop or cafe", "YTA, women should be able to do as they please, and you were being misogynistic", "Much depends upon the kind of paint, *e.g.,* oil vs. acrylic vs. watercolor. Dry watercolors don't really smell, but the need for water certainly increases the odds of spillage.", "I know what it\u2019s like to escape from my \u201cchaotic\u201d home as a teen. She found peace at this shop. Huge props to OP for creating a peaceful, relaxing shop. OP is in no way obligated to let her paint in his shop. Maybe a compromise if she returns?  A pencil and sketch book?", "I think this goes from NAH to NTA because it\u2019s an unfair assumption that she can paint there and should have asked first.", "Me too, if I were her I would never go back there again. She wasn't being disruptive, took the time and effort to lay newspaper down and protect the space. OP just lost a loyal customer over a non-issue.", "Not all paint smells, if it was watercolor, acrylics, or gouache then there likely was no odor.\n\nOils on the other hand definitely have an odor, but I can't imagine being reckless enough to bring oils to a public place where food is.", "I... am a woman...", "She can try contacting the local library to use their MakerSpace, or the Parks dept to see if they have a craft room. There are plenty of other spaces, but a place that serves food is not one of them.", "Meh, I don't think that alone is enough to make her an asshole. She made an assumption, was wrong, was confronted, and left quietly without a fuss.", "Even though she was cautious of her surroundings, other people might not and can bump into her table/space. You can do the absolute most to cover your area but any movement can cause them to spill. I assume she also had paint water to clean her brushes so that could cause a bigger mess.", "Oh well that changes things then, I thought you were a male", "She seems to know that it\u2019s an activity that requires being extra careful, hence the newspapers. It\u2019s basic courtesy to ask for permission to do a higher risk activity if said risk could effects someone else. \n\n\u201cLeft quietly without a fuss\u201d.  I think you mean minimal fuss. She protested being asked not to paint by saying she was being careful and wouldn\u2019t make a mess. That\u2019s a fuss. \n\nI don\u2019t this she\u2019s some raging asshole but she\u2019s definitely in the wrong here.", "And again, the post isn\u2019t about children, vomit, or other variations.  It\u2019s about a person painting in their cafe.  Which, regardless of the type of paint as you suggested, simply isn\u2019t appropriate according to societal norms and dept of health regulations.", "I agree with you. Oils would be a problem, but I don't see acrylics as problematic, especially if she covered the work surface.", "I was responding to your comment, not to the post."]}
