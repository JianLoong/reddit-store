We got there a little early, and her job is next door to a Starbucks so we decided to get some breakfast.

I was not. I honestly had no idea anyone was inside. I couldn\u2019t see in the building. I was just flipping off the place that takes up so much of my wife\u2019s time. Anyway, she called my wife almost immediately saying that she was \u201cupset that I would do that\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s disrespectful because I barely know her\u201d my wife told her that it was not directed at her. That it was at the building.

She comes up to me and just looks at me like she\u2019s expecting something. I try to walk around her and she blocks my way and asks \u201cwhat do you need?\u201d I\u2019m irritated at this point and ignore her and at that point my wife comes around the corner looking confused watching us. The coworker then says \u201cI was just expecting an apology for you flipping me off.\u201d I laughed and told her she was delusional and my wife then said that she already told her that I wasn\u2019t flipping her off. Basically I told the girl \u201cthat wasn\u2019t meant for you at all. But I can definitely do it again and it will be meant for you this time.\u201d And walked away. Other employees were watching this happen also. \n\nI left after having lunch with my wife and when she got home that night she told me that the coworker put in a complaint against my wife for harassment.

This is the type of stuff that destroys a workplace culture and causes people to leave.

My wife was the opener that morning and she said there would be nobody there because she was the only one going to open the building. She didn\u2019t know that one of the other managers had to go in for the kitchen. \nB) as far as I know, everyone is on my wife\u2019s side.

If you feel the need to flip a building off because she works there and she has to spend time there and cannot be with you every minute of everyday I think you need to grow up buddy.\nHonestly a 26 year old flipping off buildings is embarrassing.

I have to spend a lot of time softening those instances to the people around us, because he is a good person and means well, he's just an asshole about it.\n\nWould be nice for your wife not to have to constantly clean up after your social faux-pas' or otherwise complete lack of social decorum, but if she likes you despite that- then I guess more power to you.", "I respect your opinion. My wife doesn\u2019t clean anything up for me. I asked her then if I could tell the coworker that it wasn\u2019t meant for her and she vehemently told me not to. That she would handle it. It was ridiculous and she didn\u2019t want me involved (even though I\u2019m directly involved). I do think you\u2019re blowing a middle finger out of proportion.

If your wife was the one who told you not to do it yourself, then I'd 100% change my answer. **NTA**\n\nI guess I glossed over that fact, because I would've so readily attempted to resolve the issue that there wouldn't have been so much as beat between me seeing that person and attempting to resolve it. \n\nGranted, if they didn't accept/understand the apology from me at that point, I would've 100% flipped them off right there and then.", "I was ready to apologize while my wife was on the phone that day. I was the one who did it after all but she didn\u2019t want me to. And after going back and forth for a while I conceded."]}
