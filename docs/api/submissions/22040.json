He left you hanging by moving out and you\u2019re paying more unexpectedly. Even if he\u2019s not on the lease he still owe the lease\u2019s duration of rent, since he didn\u2019t pay you after he moved out then take his safe deposit as a form of calling it even.

You broke up, and it seems you are renting a bedroom in a house, not an apartment with a separate living space he could have stayed in till the lease finished. I know it sucks you had to pay more than you anticipated, but he also had to pay to move and find a new place. Unfortunately breaking up come with unexpected expenses. You would be stealing if you keep his money."]}
