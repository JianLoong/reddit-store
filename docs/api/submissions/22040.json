He left you with double the rent you were expecting to pay. Sounds like you keeping the deposit would just be making up a little bit of that added cost to the rent he stuck you with. From what I'm gathering, you were renting a single room together, so you couldn't just have rented out his space, as his space was also your space. So his leaving screwed you over with the rent.

IMO that would also include the security deposits associated with it as well.\n\nAlso, she was under no obligation to let him out of the lease either.  If he wanted to leave and break the lease and she didn't want to leave her friends and didn't want to pay the higher rent... he would have still been responsible for the rent, whether he stayed or not.

Maybe op makes more money and that's why she stayed. Or they both wanted to stay and he graciously gave it up to her, then she definitely needs to give the money back. There's just too many details missing to say anything but it's his money.", "I\u2019ve had multiple roommates to the point where we had to convert the living room in to a bedroom. It\u2019s not an ideal situation but it is a solution when faced with financial burden", "Also, why was he even paying a security deposit if he wasn\u2019t on the lease?", "Wouldn\u2019t that be awful? Good thing he moved out, and he\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t go after him for his portion of the rent.", ">personally i wouldve sued him for abandoning the rent he agreed to pay. together or not\n\nThat would have been the smart thing to do immediately when it happened, however:\n\n>he abandoned his part of rent. if she has proof (a recording, document, or even a text from him) that states he agreed to pay part of the rent and then he left then she has a perfectly viable case against him\n\nIs not gonna be a viable defense for not returning the deposit.\n\n\nThis whole thing really matters if the dude decides to sue in the first place, but judging by his incompetence, it's very unlikely.", "So he should find a replacement for someone to share a room with his ex? She is living in the room, it is her choice who stays, hence her responsibility. \n\n\nAnd if she was so bummed about the rent, she should have asked him to stay? Or should he have forcibly stayed with the ex cz he has rented the place? Which one do you really prefer? Ridiculous af", "The lease he so conveniently did not sign? That's even less claim to the deposit. But they still had a verbal agreement that he didn't hold.", "Neither, because you\u2019re right and both would be ridiculous. He should have continued to pay his portion until the lease was up. That\u2019s the way it works when you\u2019ve signed a lease.", "But you don't know that, do you? OP doesn't mention it was a dick move or anything. So why are you advocating for theft again?", "Lmao, why are you advocating this as theft. You don't know that ex even lays claim to it.\n\nAll it seems is that he's smart enough to not ask for the deposit back, cause he knows he forfeits it when he decided to move out."]}
