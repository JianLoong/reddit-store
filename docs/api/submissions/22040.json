He left you with double the rent you were expecting to pay. Sounds like you keeping the deposit would just be making up a little bit of that added cost to the rent he stuck you with. From what I'm gathering, you were renting a single room together, so you couldn't just have rented out his space, as his space was also your space. So his leaving screwed you over with the rent.

IMO that would also include the security deposits associated with it as well.\n\nAlso, she was under no obligation to let him out of the lease either.  If he wanted to leave and break the lease and she didn't want to leave her friends and didn't want to pay the higher rent... he would have still been responsible for the rent, whether he stayed or not.

Imagine that you\u2019re living with someone and they decide to break up with you and move out leaving you with all of the rent when you were formally responsible for half. Is that fair?
