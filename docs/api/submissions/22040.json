He left you with double the rent you were expecting to pay. Sounds like you keeping the deposit would just be making up a little bit of that added cost to the rent he stuck you with. From what I'm gathering, you were renting a single room together, so you couldn't just have rented out his space, as his space was also your space. So his leaving screwed you over with the rent.

IMO that would also include the security deposits associated with it as well.\n\nAlso, she was under no obligation to let him out of the lease either.  If he wanted to leave and break the lease and she didn't want to leave her friends and didn't want to pay the higher rent... he would have still been responsible for the rent, whether he stayed or not.

They had a verbal agreement. \n\nThat's why I wouldn't move in with someone unless we are very serious. But COVID realities forced people into these rushed decisions.", "But she stil lives there with her friends. Finding someone to take his place means finding someone to share her bed...", "What? He\u2019s supposed to keep living while they are broken up? Nah, screw that noise.", "Put yourself in the other shoes for a moment. Imagine that you\u2019re living with someone and they decide to break up with you and move out leaving you with all of the rent when you were formally responsible for half. Is that fair? If she had moved out too then they both would have broken the lease and been responsible for the remainder of it until and unless the landlord found other renters, which usually takes some time. Your view is very one sided. She did the responsible thing and stayed and paid double the amount of rent she was when he lived there.", "I could also consider this a favour that he did her. He was the one who had to find a new apartment, maybe even with higher rent or less nice, had to move his stuff etc. He could also decided he wants to stay there and let her find a new place for her self.\n\nThe point is that he did not \"broke the lease\". They ended the relationship and their living arrangement hed to change. There are two options in this case:\n1. They both leave and a find a replacement and share the costs of braking the lease (if there are any).\n2. One is taking the lease with all the responsibilities. \n\nShe (they?) Chose the second option, so he can't find someone to take his place in the apartment. If she didn't want to pay higher rent, she should have chosen option one.\nHe has his own new apartment to pay rent in. He should not pay hers as well. And if she thought that he should, she should have talked about it when they broke up, and not monthes later when she happens to have a hold of his money. That is unfair", "The money for the security deposit is being returned through the lease, so he has no claim.", "She clearly stated that she had to pick up the remaining 9 months rent. It may not have been a paper lease but it was an agreement. He reneged. He doesn't get deposit back."]}
