Most nights she doesn\u2019t even sleep here. \n\nShe was starting to leave when i asked her if she was going to her boyfriend\u2019s. She said yes, then grabbed her keys. I stopped her and said we really needed to talk about her constantly at her boyfriend\u2019s. She said \u201cwhat is there to talk about?\u201d I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her going there almost everyday if she was going to live here and that there needs to be boundaries. \n\nMy friend said how she is there every night that she has her kid, and that she only leaves when she doesnt because that\u2019s the only time she can see him. She stated that she would invite him here but she wants to be courteous to myself and my son, so she just goes over there and ends up staying the night so that she isn\u2019t coming through the door very late when my son is sleeping. She asked if this was about her leaving the cat there some days, and mentioned that this was not something I told her would be an issue when establishing house rules\n\nI told her it wasn\u2019t about the cat, it was about her never or hardly being here for days at a time, when she lives here. She said she wasn\u2019t gonna just not see her boyfriend and didn\u2019t understand the issue then walked away. This made me feel confused and now i\u2019m wondering if i might be wrong? AITA?\n\nETA: she has also said that she shouldn\u2019t have to adjust her social life just because she moved in, but i\u2019ve told her it\u2019s my house, i have rules and boundaries , she\u2019s moved into it and I feel like she can move in with her boyfriend if this is really a problem", "created_utc": 1687471634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ggloq/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_cant_stay_here_if/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re clearly lonely but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s job to fix that. Get a life, seriously.", "YTA. Tbh she sounds like an ideal roommate. If this was about her leaving the cat and you having to care for the cat, I\u2019d understand. But it sounds like you just don\u2019t like that she\u2019s not there?? I\u2019m not sure how her not being there crosses any boundaries. Id say this. If she pays a fair amount of rent, contributes to bills, cleans up after herself, and makes sure the cat is taken care of, you really shouldn\u2019t have issues with her.", "YTA. What a bizarre mindset. Why must she be in your presence?", "YTA.\n\nEveryone has explained why you\u2019re TA already: it\u2019s not okay to police how or where another adult, including your roommate/housemate, spends her time. You\u2019re not the boss of her. Surely you understand that simple concept. If she was dumping her kid on you or making you care for the cat, then you\u2019d be justified. But if she\u2019s handling her responsibilities, you have absolutely no right to act like this, and I think when you look back on this in a few years, you\u2019ll be really embarrassed. \n\nLegally, it is not just your own apartment or house, it is yours and hers. Even if her name isn\u2019t on the lease, she now has tenancy rights after living there for a few months (in most countries). You can\u2019t evict her based on this. If she pays her rent, hasn\u2019t damaged the property, and has been a respectful tenant, it\u2019s her place too now. If you evict her, you\u2019ll ruin your friendship forever. You\u2019ve probably already damaged it now, but you can save it if you apologize and back off.", "Yta so she paying rent and taking care of her cat (and yours!)?  Why do you care if she's there or not?", "YTA. You are roommates, but you are treating her like she is your teenager. It sounds like she is trying to keep respectful boundaries because of the children which is a mature view. As long as she is taking care of her child, cat, and paying her bills she is doing what she is supposed to  as a roommate.  Maybe this isn't how you viewed living together would be, but she is not doing anything wrong.", "YTA. What is the matter with you?! Why are you being controlling and possessive of a roommate?", "YTA... but she probably needs to leave because you sound unhinged. \n\nI would LOVE a roommate who paid rent but I barely saw. That's the DREAM roommate. Pays up but is rarely seen? I seriously DON'T see the issue and I cannot fathom what your problem is.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t get to control her social life just because she lives there.  She goes out of her way to ensure you are not inconvenienced by her cat or other obligations.  She is your housemate, not your partner.  You are WAY out of line.  It\u2019s not her job to make sure you\u2019re not lonely.  That\u2019s on you.", "YTA lol this has to be fake. No one can be this controlling and dense", "YTA. This is clear.", "YTA. She is an adult and can do whatever she wants with her free time. You\u2019re not trying to establish a boundary, you\u2019re trying to control something that doesn\u2019t affect you at all.", "I kept waiting for a reason that you think she should be there instead of her bf's...  still waiting...  If she's paying rent and taking care of the kitty and baby, I don't think you have much space to say anything to her...  You're TAH.", "You sound like a character at the beginning of a Stephen King novel. \n\nGet a life. Seriously. What kind of controlling horror show are you?", "YTA. She isn\u2019t violating your boundaries, she\u2019s living her life, outside of your control. She pays rent. She feeds and cleans up after her cat. As a single mother sharing co-parenting with her child\u2019s father, she\u2019s being responsible in remaining with her child when it\u2019s her custody time, and not introducing him to a boyfriend she may well not keep. So what\u2019s really bothering you?  Is it that she has a co-parent, and can go out when she\u2019s not actively parenting? A paying roommate doesn\u2019t owe you their time. They only owe you their portion of bills, and to not leave their mess for someone else to clean up. You really need to do some reflecting on what\u2019s actually bothering you. The rules that you\u2019re attempting to assert aren\u2019t rules that an adult would, or should, follow. You\u2019re on the fast track to a) losing out on a paying tenant, and b) destroying a friendship.", "Yta, what are you expecting her to do?", "I don't really understand the issue if it's not about her dumping the cat on you. Do you lose out on some kinda single persons benefit if you have a housemate or something? Where I live single people can claim a council tax reduction. I'd be pretty pissed off if I let someone move in with me and lost that even though they were never actually there. I can't see any other situation that would make it a problem though. Leaning YTA but maybe more info needed.", "Get a life. This is nuts and YTA.", "YTA \nwhat are you, her mom?? mind your business.", "Did you accidentally type \u201cfriend\u201d instead of \u201cmonogamous girlfriend\u201d because if not, I don\u2019t see how this is a problem or even any of your business. She is paying you rent; she decides where she sleeps. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nDoes she pay rent by entertaining you on weeknights or something? Why do you feel entitled to her time like this?\n\nSeriously OP, I want to empathize with you but I am honestly so confused. What do you want her to do on these nights she\u2019s with her boyfriend? Did you expect companionship or would it be fine if she was just in her bedroom alone? Was she helping with childcare? What\u2019s your motivation?\n\nI\u2019m so baffled.", "I don't think you're an asshole, but i truly don't understand what the problem is.\n\nJust take a look at your title...\n\nAITA for telling my friend she can't stay here if she doesn't stay here?\n\nLike...what?", "YTA. for the life of me, i don\u2019t know why this bothers you. sounds like she\u2019s doing everything she can to be the opposite of disruptive, and she\u2019s your friend, not your daughter.", "YTA. You struck roommate gold! Rent shared and basically the whole place to yourself!", "I\u2019m so confused. Is there mandatory monthly socializing quota she has to meet per her lease? \n\nWhy can\u2019t she be at her boyfriends house? Why can\u2019t she live her life? \n\nIs she not paying rent? Is she somehow being a careless housemate? What is the issue here? \n\nAre you jealous that she has a boyfriend and a social life? YTA. Figure out your feelings. Don\u2019t blame her for them.", "YTA!", "INFO: Does she pay rent or contribute to expenses?", "YTA. This sounds like a perfect roommate situation. She's paying bills but she's barely there. I don't understand your issue. Did you only let her in for companionship?", "Wtf? Is this a joke? Get your own social life, holy shit. YTA. I don't think you understand what boundaries are.", "This sounds like the best roommate situation ever, lol.", "YTA. She sounds like the perfect roommate. Why in the world do you need to be so controlling? Are you just really lonely?", "YTA\nThis woman is a dream housmate. Makes sure the animals are fed and cleaned and is hardly ever there.\n\nWhat business is it of yours where she sleeps? What rules and boundaries are you talking about?", "YTA. This is honestly an ideal roommate situation.", "YTA. She paying the rent? Feeding the cat? Cleaning up after the cat? What she does the rest of the time is her own business. If you\u2019d wanted a companion you should have made that clear up front.", "Wtf. Who the hell are you? No, really? \n\nI haven't even finished reading and YTA and a control freak.", "YTA\n\nYou have a roommate.  It's not your house.  Its both of your house.  She gets to do what she wants to do as long as it's not illegal, immoral or dumping you with too many household responsibilities.", "YTA and don't understand what boundaries are", "YTA\n\nThis is the one of the weirdest complaints I\u2019ve ever seen. Why should she have to be present at your house all the time just because she lives there?\n\nLiving at your house does not mean she\u2019s obliged to be there all the time. Or even at all! It means she pays money (rent) to have space set aside for her, and the option of being there if she wants to. \n\nShe pays money for rent and groceries, and takes care of her cat and her child. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have guests (like bf) over at your place all the time (intruding on your space), and instead goes to his place. \n\nSeriously - what\u2019s the issue? She\u2019s the perfect roommate.", "The best kind of roommate is the one who pays rent and bills and who is never there.   The OP should realize this.", "i just don\u2019t understand why she chose to live here if she was never gonna be here", "Exactly. Besides, as a landlord, you can only control what's in the lease. OP sounds a bit confused on the difference between a roommate and a companion. It's definitely a YTA.", "This! The best roommate is the one that\u2019s barely home but fully pays rent on time. OP needs to accept this rare gift and move on.", "Yep, what OP described is not a \u201cboundary.\u201d", "This seriously sounds like a mother/daughter issue. what the hell? I'm having flash backs to when I got my first serious girlfriend, started being gone on weekends and my mom got all \"This home is not a hotel to check in and check out as you please\" about it", "Lol, comment straight out of r/seducingwomen", "I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what this magical boundary is too. I mean, maybe (just maybe), if it were a situation like \u201chey friend, before we live together, it\u2019s really important for you to be aware that consistency is essential for Kid. Routines are a huge deal, so if you\u2019re going to be living here, popping in and out all the time just won\u2019t work. If there\u2019s going to be a time you won\u2019t be here for [dinner/bedtime/whatevs], please give Kid and I a heads up in advance so he knows what to expect. I totally get that it\u2019s kind of an imposition, and it is something we\u2019re working on, but currently, it\u2019s incredibly stressful for him when routines change suddenly. If that\u2019s not going to work for you, I absolutely respect that, but it\u2019s better we don\u2019t live together then.\u201d", "she gives me money each month and buys groceries", "That is the only thing that makes sense. OP wants the roomie for theirself.", "I actually have a boyfriend. It just feels like my apartment is being used for storage at times", "Ummm how is she a Bum when she pays rent and buys food for the place? Lol do you know what bum even means?", "This take is nonsense.", "And buys food that she\u2019s not there to eat.", "I just saw that the friend pays money every month and buys groceries.", "Seriously, this is the best roommate ever.", "If you\u2019re jealous and want to spend more time with her you should just tell her that", "You don\u2019t need to understand it. \n\nThough, I will say it seems pretty simple - she\u2019s not ready to move in with him, needs a place to bring her son to during her time with him, and doesn\u2019t want to interrupt your routine with your child, so she stays over rather than coming home at all hours. What\u2019s complicated?", "It sounds like she's not ready to move in with her bf because of her kid.", "Didn't you just say she's there on days she has her kid, and stops by after work to check the cats? How is that never there?", "I don't understand why you are caring so much. She pays rent and for food.", "But what boundaries is she crossing or not honoring?  I am confused. YTA.", "Are you wanting more of a romantic relationship with your friend ?\n\nIf she's paying rent,  you do not get to dictate how they live their life.\n\nWould you want whoever holds the mortgage to your home to dictate how you live?  Or a landlord telling you how to live your life?\n\nEdit: YTA", "Do you need to understand everything?\n\nAs you said, she is pulling her weight, and more. I assume you want her there for company? If so, you are very wrong and you should get a life. She can do as she pleases, and you are a winner for having the whole house for you for half the price.", "You don\u2019t need to understand. She pays her fair share. You don\u2019t get to set \u201cboundaries\u201d to control other peoples behavior. YTA", "Welcome to the real world. How is it any of your business with whatever she\u2019s doing. You\u2019re coming off as possessive jealous individuals. She can go whatever tf she want. She\u2019s not your kid. You are one crazy person.", "You issue sounds like you feel spending time with you is not a priority for your friend. \nBut that\u2019s not what you have actually communicated to her. \nIf you feel she\u2019s abandoned your friendship for her boyfriend, then tell her that, so you can work on the actual issue. But you have to be honest and communicate properly.", "You don\u2019t understand how someone has a HOME where they actually live and keep all their stuff, but sometimes choose to go elsewhere too?", "Because she needs a safe place for her kid. If she's paying rent and cleans up after herself what's it matter.", "It sounds like you had expectations that her moving in was going to be one big happy fun times with friend event.\n\nShe has a life and she is living it. Just like you. \n\nTake a step back and realize that you are being unreasonable, verging on the creepy.", "Why did it matter?", "And none of us understands why that bothers you.", "It seems like she\u2019s there several nights a week with her kid?", "Damn, when my kids became adults and disappeared. I was pretty happy. They were self sufficient, moving in the right direction as far as not living with me until they were 40 and well happy.  I am wanting to be seen as a motel.", "Wouldn't know.  But, real talk, my dude: what other possible reason would there be for wanting a housemate around more?", "Why would her kid be disrupted by his mom\u2019s roommate not being consistently around? That makes no sense, that\u2019s not his mom and it\u2019s not really typical for kids to live with adults that aren\u2019t their parents, so that is absolutely not a defense. And even if OP\u2019s kid did have some kind of issue, it\u2019s his mom\u2019s job to explain that the roommate is an adult with her own life. This take is almost as bizarre as the original post.", "YTA then. If she's paying rent then it's totally fine for her to stay at your place when she has her son with her, and crash at her BF's the rest of the time. Especially so if she's making sure to take care of her cat and provide groceries. \n  \nI think if anything it sounds like you're put off from being in the dark on when she'll be there and when she won't be - just talk to her about it, it sounds like less of a boundaries issue and more like a friendship/communication issue.", "YTA\n\nwhat business is it of yours where she spends her time? What exactly is the beef here? Are you jealous?", "YTA. She's paying rent and helping with groceries. She's a renter/roommate, not your partner/SO. As long as she is doing any chores that were agreed on, you have no right to tell her how or where to spend her time. What she is doing obviously works for her, you don't need to understand it.", "I urge you to reflect on what the real issue is. It seems she moved in, in order to be somewhere with her child. She\u2019s paying you money, buying groceries and being responsible where and when she should be in your home. A landlord would never ask you why you live in an apt if you are never there, their sole concern is that the person is paying. Now if you allowed her to live there because you thought you would have companionship/ a constant friend that sounds different, also that was your expectation, perhaps not hers. She\u2019s not coming in/out at all hours of the night, respecting your space by not bringing her bf in/out. You\u2019re being a little ridiculous, reflect on your emotions and what\u2019s really triggering you. Yta.", "She doesn\u2019t give you money, she pays you rent. You\u2019re being codependent and controlling. Why are you clocking all her movements? She\u2019s a grown woman she can leave her house that she pays rent for whenever she wants. Why do you think it\u2019s ok to tell a grown ass woman she\u2019s not home enough? Are you her Mom? Sounds like you wanted a built in companion that pays you to be your friend. It\u2019s really shitty of you and I doubt you\u2019ll have the friendship much longer at this rate.", "LOL I'd move this weekend if I were that roommate man.", "Even if she is, she is paying for it.

She\u2019s paying for it and buying you food so wtf is the issue?", "Yes, I know what it means    It\u2019s about character, not just money", "That's what I got out of it too.

Boundaries are *not* giving other people a list of ways they're required to act/behave, they're establishing your own behavior in certain situations. \n\nAnd I doubt legally, let alone morally, it's acceptable for a landlord to say  \"I'm going to evict you if you don't hang out with me.\"", "So someone paying her rent buying food she doesn\u2019t eat and taking care of her animal makes her a bum because she doesn\u2019t hang out with OP?
