Most nights she doesn\u2019t even sleep here. \n\nShe was starting to leave when i asked her if she was going to her boyfriend\u2019s. She said yes, then grabbed her keys. I stopped her and said we really needed to talk about her constantly at her boyfriend\u2019s. She said \u201cwhat is there to talk about?\u201d I told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate her going there almost everyday if she was going to live here and that there needs to be boundaries. \n\nMy friend said how she is there every night that she has her kid, and that she only leaves when she doesnt because that\u2019s the only time she can see him. She stated that she would invite him here but she wants to be courteous to myself and my son, so she just goes over there and ends up staying the night so that she isn\u2019t coming through the door very late when my son is sleeping. She asked if this was about her leaving the cat there some days, and mentioned that this was not something I told her would be an issue when establishing house rules\n\nI told her it wasn\u2019t about the cat, it was about her never or hardly being here for days at a time, when she lives here. She said she wasn\u2019t gonna just not see her boyfriend and didn\u2019t understand the issue then walked away. This made me feel confused and now i\u2019m wondering if i might be wrong? AITA?\n\nETA: she has also said that she shouldn\u2019t have to adjust her social life just because she moved in, but i\u2019ve told her it\u2019s my house, i have rules and boundaries , she\u2019s moved into it and I feel like she can move in with her boyfriend if this is really a problem", "created_utc": 1687471634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ggloq/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_cant_stay_here_if/", "score": 2593, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re clearly lonely but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s job to fix that. Get a life, seriously.", "YTA. Tbh she sounds like an ideal roommate. If this was about her leaving the cat and you having to care for the cat, I\u2019d understand. But it sounds like you just don\u2019t like that she\u2019s not there?? I\u2019m not sure how her not being there crosses any boundaries. Id say this. If she pays a fair amount of rent, contributes to bills, cleans up after herself, and makes sure the cat is taken care of, you really shouldn\u2019t have issues with her.", "YTA. What a bizarre mindset. Why must she be in your presence?", "YTA.\n\nEveryone has explained why you\u2019re TA already: it\u2019s not okay to police how or where another adult, including your roommate/housemate, spends her time. You\u2019re not the boss of her. Surely you understand that simple concept. If she was dumping her kid on you or making you care for the cat, then you\u2019d be justified. But if she\u2019s handling her responsibilities, you have absolutely no right to act like this, and I think when you look back on this in a few years, you\u2019ll be really embarrassed. \n\nLegally, it is not just your own apartment or house, it is yours and hers. Even if her name isn\u2019t on the lease, she now has tenancy rights after living there for a few months (in most countries). You can\u2019t evict her based on this. If she pays her rent, hasn\u2019t damaged the property, and has been a respectful tenant, it\u2019s her place too now. If you evict her, you\u2019ll ruin your friendship forever. You\u2019ve probably already damaged it now, but you can save it if you apologize and back off.", "Yta so she paying rent and taking care of her cat (and yours!)?  Why do you care if she's there or not?", "YTA. You are roommates, but you are treating her like she is your teenager. It sounds like she is trying to keep respectful boundaries because of the children which is a mature view. As long as she is taking care of her child, cat, and paying her bills she is doing what she is supposed to  as a roommate.  Maybe this isn't how you viewed living together would be, but she is not doing anything wrong.", "YTA. What is the matter with you?! Why are you being controlling and possessive of a roommate?", "YTA... but she probably needs to leave because you sound unhinged. \n\nI would LOVE a roommate who paid rent but I barely saw. That's the DREAM roommate. Pays up but is rarely seen? I seriously DON'T see the issue and I cannot fathom what your problem is.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t get to control her social life just because she lives there.  She goes out of her way to ensure you are not inconvenienced by her cat or other obligations.  She is your housemate, not your partner.  You are WAY out of line.  It\u2019s not her job to make sure you\u2019re not lonely.  That\u2019s on you.", "YTA lol this has to be fake. No one can be this controlling and dense", "YTA. This is clear.", "YTA. She is an adult and can do whatever she wants with her free time. You\u2019re not trying to establish a boundary, you\u2019re trying to control something that doesn\u2019t affect you at all.", "I kept waiting for a reason that you think she should be there instead of her bf's...  still waiting...  If she's paying rent and taking care of the kitty and baby, I don't think you have much space to say anything to her...  You're TAH.", "You sound like a character at the beginning of a Stephen King novel. \n\nGet a life. Seriously. What kind of controlling horror show are you?", "YTA. She isn\u2019t violating your boundaries, she\u2019s living her life, outside of your control. She pays rent. She feeds and cleans up after her cat. As a single mother sharing co-parenting with her child\u2019s father, she\u2019s being responsible in remaining with her child when it\u2019s her custody time, and not introducing him to a boyfriend she may well not keep. So what\u2019s really bothering you?  Is it that she has a co-parent, and can go out when she\u2019s not actively parenting? A paying roommate doesn\u2019t owe you their time. They only owe you their portion of bills, and to not leave their mess for someone else to clean up. You really need to do some reflecting on what\u2019s actually bothering you. The rules that you\u2019re attempting to assert aren\u2019t rules that an adult would, or should, follow. You\u2019re on the fast track to a) losing out on a paying tenant, and b) destroying a friendship.", "Yta, what are you expecting her to do?", "I don't really understand the issue if it's not about her dumping the cat on you. Do you lose out on some kinda single persons benefit if you have a housemate or something? Where I live single people can claim a council tax reduction. I'd be pretty pissed off if I let someone move in with me and lost that even though they were never actually there. I can't see any other situation that would make it a problem though.

Why should she have to be present at your house all the time just because she lives there?\n\nLiving at your house does not mean she\u2019s obliged to be there all the time. Or even at all! It means she pays money (rent) to have space set aside for her, and the option of being there if she wants to. \n\nShe pays money for rent and groceries, and takes care of her cat and her child. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have guests (like bf) over at your place all the time (intruding on your space), and instead goes to his place. \n\nSeriously - what\u2019s the issue?

What boundaries. I'm again, confused.", "I had the opposite. I moved into my first place with a friend at college. It was the first time I ever had to share a bedroom as I had 2 brothers. She wouldn't let me have any alone time. If I was in the living room and went into the bedroom, she would follow me and vice versa. Our roommates tried to set house rules like no drinking inside or outside the house. I was 21 but they tried to lock us out one time when we were came home from a friend's house. We had some to drink but were far from drunk. After that, I set the rules that I was an adult who wasn't going to be policed or controlled because they don't like what I'm doing. I never had anyone over. I was thankfully only there for 6 months.", "I did have a live in bff and this happened (they started spending a lot of time at their girlfriends place) it basically happens a lot when mates get a house together doesn't it? Someone will get a partner and spend a lot of time with new partner. Better than them having that partner essentially move in with you and use your space/utilities/food etc. \n\n\nand yeah it was a little sad to not hang out as much but there's nothing more to it. You hang out with other friends, enjoy the solitude, find a gf yourself etc.\n\n\n\nDoesn't even sound like OP and their flatmate are friends so wtf are OPs boundaries?", "Is it possible she also wants the roommate to help with childcare, and she\u2019s no longer getting that help if her friend is gone all the time?", "People dream of a responsible roommate who\u2019s hardly around. She found the unicorn and is trying to kill it.", "I really think this is the answer. Either that or she\u2019s got this weird possession obsession toward her I\u2019ve experienced from mean girls. Or both.", "Or even 55! My dad moved back in with his mom\u2026who already lived with his sister\u2026at the age of 55. This was 12 years ago. All three still live together, unhappily.", "Right? I kinda thought once I started reading that the roommate left for BF\u2019s house and left OP to care for child or cat.", "Boundaries being an electric fence line and a shock collar", "They\u2019re confusing boundary as something that limits someone with cage that keeps someone in. \u201cMy boundary is you can\u2019t hang out with other people and I have to be your only friend.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou keep using that word and I do not think you know what it means.\u201d", "That's a win-win in my book, turning cash with what I'm assuming is virtually no effort beyond cashing a check.  If I were her friend I'd just move out and not bother talking to OP again.", "Touch\u00e9", "Underrated comment", "Either jealous she has a boyfriend or wants a friend who has to hang out. Having a paying roommate who is never there is the dream scenario, this is the opposite of a problem!", "See: 50% of my friends lol\n\nI mean, I totally get prioritising your partner and wanting to spend time with them/organising around them to an extent.  It\u2019s more when it turns into, \u201ccan x come, too?\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t because x is busy\u201d all the time that I get annoyed.  Or they\u2019re literally never available because of said partner.\n\nMy partner and I love our quality time together and we\u2019re constantly on the go.  But that\u2019s also exactly why I make an effort to hang with my other friends without him unless it\u2019s a true group outing.  Because I also value those relationships as well.\n\nAnyway, OP is heckin\u2019 weird - is the friend supposed to just sit at home every evening alone?", "I assumed this was a dude who doesn't understand the difference between 'living together ' and 'being together '. Yuck.", "Right?! I'd be thrilled to have a roomie like this.", "Right?! Sounds great and they're actually a thoughtful roommate.", "Apparently some people think they\u2019re getting a live in bestie. I was shocked, too. I never anticipated it as a potential issue.", "That sounds like a terrible roommate. It\u2019s such a crapshoot moving in with someone! A respectful, reasonable roommate who\u2019s clean is worth their weight in gold.", "Maybe she\u2019s mad that she has to do all the chores when roomie is with bf", "That's her responsibility as a parent not the roommates responsibility and sacrifice", "There is no other reasonable explanation.", "Exactly. A boundary might be \u201cI will not let anyone talk down to me\u201d what she wants is to set rules or control other people.", "Right?! Meanwhile I was thinking wow a perfect tenant/ housemate \ud83d\ude05", "Or wanted a free onsite babysitter for their kid, but can\u2019t if roommates never there unless it\u2019s their own custody time. \n\nFrankly a roommate that pays on time and is barely there sounds perfect \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02", "I thought that, when we got to the cat part, OP would say that she\u2019s neglecting the cat and putting that responsibility on OP. But she\u2019s still doing all her cat chores.\n\nThere is literally nothing wrong about roommates behaviour at all. You are 100000% right in this is a dream scenario!", "no, not alone, with OP", "oh yeah... I am still unsure about the gender of this person. and also whether or not they are romantically interested in OP or just want someone to hang with. regardless, super clingy", "Maybe also a babysitter? She's there, but only if she's got the kid. But that means half the time OP can't make her watch OPs own child for some time.", "Touch\u00e9", "Exactly! what a lovely, considerate friend and roommate", "She sounds like she thinks she's got parental authority over her friend just because she lives in her house.", "No no no, she doesn\u2019t expect her friend to leave over this. Just that she will stop seeing her bf so she can spend more time at the house! \n\nI mean, everyone is assuming it\u2019s a loneliness thing.. I wonder if it\u2019s also a free childcare thing so she can go out and roomie can cover!", "Shit, I would run after that comment. Wtf does she want me at the house all the time for?", "The sort of boundaries she\u2019s trying to set are the boundaries you\u2019d give a teenage child, not an adult friend.", "Maybe OP thought that with a roommate with a kid she will have more free childcare?", "People love to overuse the word \"boundaries\". What on earth is OP's boundary here? You must sleep at least 4 nights, a week here?", "I think OP was expecting that they could share childcare while living together", "Exactly.  Had to deal with this when I lived with my grandmother for a while during my disability claim. Finally just moved in with boyfriends mom who is also a friend because I couldn\u2019t take being treated like a kid. I was 40 and yes I wanted to go have my bf help me with showering and stuff instead of her. Don\u2019t know why that was hard to understand.", "That is definitely not the correct use of that word.", "I totally second this. Like why does she care what the roommate is doing? It\u2019s not causing damage to her.", "Yeup they want us to sit here, do nothing and have 0 social life. I\u2019m 22 still going through this.", "Oooh they definitely need to talk about boundaries, but it's not the conversation OP thinks it is.", "Confusion Canoe is my new favorite phrase \u2014 I\u2019ll be looking for opportunities to use it tomorrow!", "you don't get a roommate to not feel alone, though, you get a friend.", "So I\u2019m not the only one who caught that vibe. Op is being creepy.", "Ugh, this! Judging from these other comments, this is actually a fairly common attitude for roommates to have! So frustrating. Being someone\u2019s roommate doesn\u2019t entitle you to be their bff!\n\nOne of my housemates is like this and it\u2019s *awful.* He can track my movements every time I leave from a different door than normal or say I can\u2019t hang out tonight but then go on to see another friend. Feels personally slighted every time \ud83d\ude2d", "Ding ding ding!  Free child care is the only reason I can think of other than op being a clingy person.", "That is what I was thinking! (Free childcare people suck when they just expect it and assume that will be your role).", "Right! That\u2019s not even what a boundary is. The roommate is probably leaving when she can because OP is insane.", "Like my cousin\u2026 she invited me to move in after a break up! My daughter and I did, as we were out of state moving closer by family and this allowed a solution right away to get out of his house. Her hidden agenda was I cook for their family, clean the house like a maid, and watch her kids. \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e \n\nI just don\u2019t understand people so controlling (and my cousin is also very dramatic and everything has to be about her). TOXIC \n\nI hope the roommate moves out as soon as she can\u2026 RUN, girl! RUN!!! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Ooooohh!\n\nI hadn\u2019t considered that! Do we have any notion of gender or romantic attraction?", "They sound like the worst \ud83e\udd23\n\n/s", "Because she\u2019s got serious emotional problems around controlling behaviour, and/or thinks she\u2019s her roommate\u2019s mother. This smacks hard of someone who has never emotionally matured into sharing space with people without a parental hierarchy involved.\n\nOP, YTA, get a grip of yourself. This is a fellow adult. You don\u2019t get to interfere in her relationship. You don\u2019t get to set \u201cboundaries\u201d about how much time she spends where. She\u2019s taking care of the animals, you\u2019re being ridiculous.", "Yeah it she's leaving dishes in the sink for weeks because she's not home enough to do them and leaving her kid and the cats unattended that is 100% a genuine thing to he upset about. The friend tried to pull \"since I'm not here as much can I pay less rent\" that also wouldn't be cool. But nothing about this situation as described is something OP has any say in calling \"boundaries\" because that's not what boundaries are", "Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.", "I think we overlook the part, where the friend only goes to her BF when her kid is not with her. Aka the kid doesn't know the BF yet. And I think that is great, because that shows thought and care for her kid", "We don't know OPs gender but that doesn't matter because it reads like jealousy anyway. I think OP intended to take the friendship to another level when the \"friend\" moved in and is now pissed, because she doesn't want more...", "I think OP is in love with roommate tbh\n\nI kept waiting for there to be a part where she was leaving her kid with OP all the time, or that she wasn\u2019t taking care of the cat -  but nope. She\u2019s done everything that she should be doing.", "Or maybe she thought she'd have a live in babysitter? Or just all of the above reasons everyone else listed.  OP is definitely the AH and a weirdo.", "To be honest, it feels this is kind of made up.", "OP apparently thinks \u201cboundaries\u201d means like a wall around your house keeping you in", "Have a roommate that pays on time, takes care of their shit, but is never there. Sounds like a win to me, not sure what OP should be complaining about.", "I don\u2019t think OP understands what \u201cboundaries\u201d are.", "I wouldn\u2019t even want my partner around all the time like that.\n\nObviously yes, absolutely happy to have them around whenever and all, but I do also like my solo chill time.  They can be in the space but zero problems being in different rooms doing our own thing so we get space.", "My spouse and I moved in together earlier than planned because their potential roommate didn\u2019t like the idea of them spending a lot of time at my house. \n\nIt was a strange issue to me as well.", "THIS! \n\n& Apparently it only happens to people not smart enough to be grateful for it.\n\nI get OP thought there'd be more friend time. \n\nBut better to miss a roommate a bit than wishing they would GTFO of the house every once in a while.", "Exactly! Getting paid by someone for something they hardly use is ideal. OP stopping their friend to take away her keys like that sounds like something a controlling parent would do", "That was my thoughts exactly", "I kind of think that\u2019s a difference in lifestyle. My spouse and I both WFH and do most social things together. We\u2019re together near constantly and have been for years. I\u2019m super introverted and we have the same group of friends. I also don\u2019t drive so, most things are \u201ccan x come too\u201d for both of us. At social events we tend to separate and just check in on one another, or if it\u2019s more intimate we may snuggle up a little bit still hold 1 on 1 convos with other people. So I guess people still have us individually even if we\u2019re together.\n\nMy spouse has a shared hobby with friends that they do just them multiple times a week\u2014but I\u2019ve had an open invitation for a while that I doing cash in because I don\u2019t want to go lol.\n\nPersonally, I just wouldn\u2019t be compatible with a friend that isn\u2019t fine with my Spouse coming along to most everything if they\u2019re interested. \n\nAll that to say, even if that\u2019s how OPs friend is\u2014that\u2019s a platonic compatibility issue rather than a cohabitation problem. Something to address the friendship over but maybe not the lease.", "6 roommates like OP has and you\u2019re golden!", "It\u2019s genuinely boggling. I am wondering if OP is someone who is not managing to juggle a social life around being a single parent and has gone a bit down some irrational lines of thinking due to their only meaningful social contact being parenting a small human. The assumption of the parent role in all interactions plus desperation for adult company plus degraded social skills from isolation plus a hefty degree of entitlement about a \u201cmy house my rules\u201d attitude could lead someone to the point where they genuinely don\u2019t realise how outrageous and unreasonable their demands are.", "Who the fuck *doesn't* want to get paid for nothing?", "That's the only thing i can think of. op wanted the option to leave the kid at home with someone", "She even takes care of OP's cat.", "Or watching ops kid", "maybe she wants the room-mate to be around more so she has to watch her own kid less? i've known a few people like that before.", "I think the issue is that the roommate was her friend before moving in, and she's probably feeling a little hurt and snubbed that her friend never wants to hang out with her, even just for a cuppa and chat before going to her boyfriend's.\n\nShe's absolutely going about it the wrong way in how she's talking to her friend about it though."]}
