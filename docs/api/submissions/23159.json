We had been in Japan for two weeks and up until then everything was pretty much okay. We had a lot of fun travelling around the country (we are from Europe btw). \r  \nIn the afternoon as we we're waiting in line, she asked me to tell a joke. So I told one and that joke apparently hurt her feelings. She was upset and went quiet. \r  \nI told her I was sorry but she didn't accept my apology. She told me how that hurt her feelings and that I shouldn't be telling jokes like that. I was pissed why she couldn't just let it go and stopped talking to her. The mood worsened and she suggested that we separate for a moment so that everyone could calm down. After about 15 minutes she sent me a text message asking me to meet up. When I met her we got into a huge argument where she told me she was sad because there is always a bit of truth behind a joke and how my \"joke\"  ruined her mood. I asked her why she always felt the need to push it and that I told her I was sorry before. \r  \nI told her that she was no fun to be with, got up and left the park. She sent me a text asking me if I was leaving her alone at the park to which I didn't reply. \r  \nShe then called me and was crying on the phone. I asked if she could finally pull herself together? She didn't reply, I asked again but she only asked crying If I was seriously leaving her alone like that and to stop yelling at her. She drove me mad. She apologized for calling, I told her \"nice try but that's not working\" and we hung up. \r  \nI went back to the hotel and when she came back about 3 hours later she didn't talk to me. She took a shower and then told me she couldn't believe that I left her alone at the park, in a foreign country, with no cellphone (her phone died after our call). That she didn't know how to get back to the hotel (the park was an hour away), and when she finally found the hotel that she couldn't get in because I had both keys, so she had to ask other people to help her out and that she felt abandened by me. We had another argument, I told her my view and she suggested we put the matter aside as we had a long way home the next day. \r  \nWe've been home for 2 days now and we only talk to each other the bare minimum. She only told me that her trust in me was broken and that family never leaves someone behind, especially not in a foreign country. That I didn't care about what happened to her.  \r  \nI don't think that I did something wrong? Maybe I really shouldn't have left her behind like that but she kind of deserved it. She should have just accepted my apology and pulled herself together. \r  \n\r  \nTldr: My wife and I got into an argument on vacation and I left her alone and went back to the hotel. She is now angry with me for abandoning her in a foreign country, telling me her trust in me is broken. \r  \n\r  \nSo AITA here?", "created_utc": 1690354333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159y2oz/aita_for_leaving_my_wife_alone_at_disneyland/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She had no way of contacting you, you took away her ability to get into the hotel room you are such an asshole. Do you realize that if anything had happened to her you wouldn't have known where she was or how to contact her.\n\nI really want to know what joke you said that got her upset in the first place. Your intentional exclusion of telling us what the joke was while constantly refrecencing it in your explanation tells me that you know that there is something wrong with the joke you told but you don't want to say it because it'll make you come off as a bigger asshole than you already are.", "INFO: what was the joke?", "YTA do you even love your wife? WTF did I just read", "So you told a 'joke' that upset her.  A 'joke' that was apparently something you don't want to repeat in this forum, so I'm guessing it was, in fact, pretty bad.  \n\nYour wife called you on it.\n\nAfter a brief calm-down time she explained to you why she was upset.\n\nYou told her \"she was no fun to be with\" and left.\n\nIt was not unreasonable for her to be upset by the joke.  It was a good idea to spend a few minutes apart to calm down.  It was not unreasonable for her to explain in more detail why your \"joke\" upset her.\n\nYou refused to accept responsibility for upsetting her.  Instead of talking through this and delivering an actual, sincere apology, you left.\n\nSo far, wife 2, you 0. \n\nShe called you, crying.  Were you sympathetic? No.  You blamed her for making you angry.  You refused her apology (so, it's only your wife who isn't allowed to refuse to accept an apology, right?).  \n\nWhen she finally managed to get back to your hotel, you had another argument.\n\nShe told you her trust in you was broken.   THIS IS A BIG DEAL.  And you STILL don't think you did anything wrong!\n\nJFC.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nHOW? Literally HOW have you written that all out and still think you weren't in the wrong AT EVERY POINT?", "Absolutely TA. \n\nI wouldn't dare dream of leaving my SO stranded in a place they're not familiar with in a language they may not know. \n\nThe fact you can't see your own wrongdoings here is just a joke, really.\n\nI'm not surprised she doesn't want to talk to you. I wouldn't walk to even be near you if you heard me crying and laughed about it and didn't attempt to find me and help me.\n\nArsehole behaviour, I advise her to leave you", "So many questions \nWhat was the joke?\nWhy did you have both keys?( for real kind of defeats the purpose of have two keys)\nWhy are you such an asshole ?", "YTA. Tell us the joke you coward", "YTA and please tell us this funny joke because unless it was why did the chicken cross the road and the answer was to get to the other side and she went off on you which I\u2019m guessing didn\u2019t happen I\u2019m thinking it was below the belt or you would have included it to make yourself look better.", "YTA.\n\nLike there's even a question.", "You sound abusive. Yes of course YTA", "Definitely, YTA. How big an AH depends on what the joke is. It was obviously a joke at her expense. You should not have left your wife completely alone. That was unacceptable.", " If you ask if someone is justified in being mad at you, and you know why they're mad at you, but you dont tell the person you're asking, you already know YTA.", "YTA.So the facts, you \"jokingly\" called you wife fat, ugly or something, she gets mad, you fake apolagize and then get pissed she is still mad so you abandoned her alone in an amusement park in another country without way to contact and go to the hotel with the keys, yeah you are a huge AH. \n\nAmd the fact that you can't see that even days later probes it even more, but I doubt you'll have a wife for much more so maybe with the next one.", "YTA, I think the whole situation is unusual and I am curious about this joke, but even if she was totally overreacting (to be determined) leaving her alone with no way of getting home and even having both the keys to get into the hotel is totally out of order. The fact that you cannot seem to understand that is worrying. The fact you don't seem to care how that made someone feel is worrying.", "wow dude. Jokes and frustration aside you don't leave a person behind man.  You can have your disagreements and all of that but there has to be a parley for certain things.  Like your wife's safety is one of them.  Does not matter how pissed you are at a person you don't put their health and safety on the line to prove a point.  I have a suspicion you have either been married for not very long or maybe too long. \n\nEither or you need to catch a wakeup call my man.  Maybe you were right or maybe you were wrong but what you did afterwards is what's going to cost you your marriage.  win a battle but at the cost of losing the war.  Not clever. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\n\u201cI was totally ok with my wife being mugged, assaulted and murdered in a foreign country, AITA\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s what could have happened. She needs a new husband.", "YTA. I\u2019m pretty sure she DID NOT even ask you to tell a joke.", "I really hope this is a wake-up call for your wife. You left her alone with no phone, no hotel key, and no way to communicate in a foreign country. Many Japanese people have taken English, but they tend to be a lot better at reading and writing than they are at speaking. The no phone thing is also a huge deal. Do you guys not carry chargers or plan ahead? Your reasoning behind your actions is just ridiculous.  sHe cAn'T tAkE a jOkE. Get a divorce already and let her find someone decent. You should probably not be in a relationship until you have had therapy... YTA", "YTA\n\nMy ex husband was like you. I hope after this your wife sees you for what you are, and abandons you like you did her.", "YTA how is this even a question?", "YTA and whether you realize it or not,  it's clearly over. You never walk away to punish your 'SO', especially in that situation. Grow up or don't be in a relationship next time.", "As others have said, you not saying what the joke was is very telling", "The fact that this all revolves around the joke, but you\u2019re refusing to tell us the joke is a red flag.

Cause you seem to have not enlighten us on purpose \n\nAnd secondly, dude sorry but you're manipulative asf, she is hurt ( it seems like it's not the first time you do that btw ) , she doesn't buy it and doesn't speak much ( so not being violent or angry ) , then you meet up again, she tries to explain her feelings to you, calmly and you literally got angry at her, wtf ?\n\nAfter that you have an argument ( jeez thanks she's finally getting mad ) , and after that you leave her alone in a foreign country an hour away from the hotel ????\n\nAnd when she RIGHTFULLY call you crying and anxious you're acting as she's manipulating you by crying ? \n\nDude, she deserves so much better.", "YTA. You abandoned your wife in a foreign country where English is not the first language. I bet your joke was offensive to women which is why she reacted like this. No one gets upset over an innocent \u2018joke\u2019. Even not knowing the joke, I can say you\u2019re the AH.", "YTA. So many reasons, but I can\u2019t help noticing the missing reasons - what was the joke? Why did you have both keys (that looks kind of controlling on its own).", "You sound like an asshole. What was the joke?\n\nYTA", "YTA. I can't believe that you had so little regard for her wellbeing and safety.", "YTA. Your complete lack of concern for her safety and security is a marriage dealbreaker. And then to say she deserved it because her feelings were hurt? You are not relationship material.", "INFO: What was the joke, Richard?", "INFO: What was the joke?", "YTA. You have to be the worst husband ever! If I was your wife, I would leave you so fast. You are untrustworthy. She can't count on you. You're a bully also. You took the keys so she couldn't get in. She could have been taken. You left her vulnerable, and you didn't care. She deserves someone a million times better than you.", "WOW. I really hope this was an eye opener for her and she decides to leave you. YTA", "YTA!!!!!! 10000000000% \n\n1. You told a terrible joke. So terrible you wouldn't even put in your post. It was offensive and your wife was hurt. After you \"apologized\" (was it even a real apology though) and she didn't immediately snap her fingers and  get over it, you 2. invalidated her and then 3. essentially punished her for being upset at something YOU did. You 4. left her stranded in a foreign country with 5. no phone and 6. no access to the hotel. 7. You're still blaming her for all of it because she didn't except your apology in the first place (classic narcissistic trait) 8. She told you that her trust in you was broken and you still see nothing wrong!!! \n\nYTA completely!! I hope one day she realizes that she deserves much better and gets the hell out of this abusive relationship with you!! Something tells me that is normal behavior for you and that she is starting to starting to get sick of it. \n\nSo what was the joke? \ud83d\ude44", ">she felt abandened by me. \n\nThat would be because you abandoned her in a busy amusement park in a foreign country without her phone. What was the joke? Like clearly YTA for the actions for sure, the level of disregard for her well-being and safety is deeply shocking to put it lightly. Honestly, you're both lucky she was able to get back to the hotel without something horrible happening, it's important you understand that you put her in danger.\nBut like what was the joke? Will it further make it obvious how big of an AH you are if you share it?", "YTA obviously \n\nI find it really suspicious that you won\u2019t even repeat the nasty joke you said \n\nI hope your wife finds a good divorce attorney", "YTA. YTA. YTA.\nVery obvious one too. The lack of self awareness is concerning and this is straight up abusive. Also you purposefully leaving out the joke is not helping your case.", "I mean, YTA for abandoning your wife in a foreign country. If the joke was so horrible it hurt her feelings, that probably adds another layer of ass.", "What was the joke?", "YTA and I think you know that. You owe your wife a huge apology and you need to stop being an AH. You\u2019re wasting your time trying to garner any support in this subreddit.", "YTA majorly, left her in a foreign country on her own without a key or knowledge of where the hotel is. \n\nI\u2019d leave you!\n\nInteresting how you won\u2019t share what the joke is\u2026", "YTA. Be glad that your wife is still with you. I wouldn't be surprised if she left you. I can't believe you abandoned her like that in a foreign country and then came on reddit seeking validation for your behavior! She doesn't speak the langauge, she had no way on contacting you and you had both room keys! What's wrong with you? Can you even imagine how scared she must've been? That's a huge risk you took with her safety! You should apologise OP and hope your wife can forgive you.", "YTA the fact that you won't post your \"joke\" along with the other really awful details tell me all I need to know. I hope she divorces you and goes on to live her best life without you.", "Huge YTA. Even before you left her alone in a theme park with no phone, no idea how to get to your hotel an hour away, and can\u2019t get in because you have both keys. You did break her trust. Your attitude around it was like you were trying to teach her a lesson. She should kick your red flagged ass to the curb.", "YTA.\n\nAITA subreddit is really turning  into the best anti-marriage campaign ad that has ever existed XD.", "YTA. You sound insufferable with the emotional maturity of a toddler.", "YTA\n\nA massive one.\nI got angry on your wife's behalf only reading this, so I dread imagining how you are in real life. \n\nFrom your post (admittedly, just a small chunk of you and your life), you seem :\n\n- very self-righteous, with no visible capacity for self-awareness or ability to self-reflect\n\n- uncaring, almost to the point of cruelty. You left with no message and with the two hotel keys and that didn't bother you at all ?\n\n- manipulative, maybe abusive. She called you crying and you dismissed her the way you did ? Also, it seems like you lashed out at her for *daring* to get upset at your joke (what was the joke ?) and to ask for an apology and then to ask whether you were leaving her alone. You punished her for daring to go against you and for criticising what you said and did. Abusive.\n\nYou went so far beyond what's acceptable between two people that I am flabbergasted you come here to ask whether you are the AH. In a way, I am glad you did, maybe there is hope for you yet.\n\nYou suck and I feel sorry for your wife. I hope she leaves you if you carry on like this.

She \"trusted\" you in telling you how she felt, and honestly, all I kept reading from your apology was \"Sorry but not sorry\" after the way you treated her. You left her in unknown territory with no regard to what could've happened to her. I'm glad she found her way back, but I sure wish she hadn't come back to you.

Do you even love your wife at all?", "YTA. My ex left me alone in a large city with their friend I'd only met that day for the first time after storming off without a word. That was enough for me to break it off. The danger of being left alone at night with a stranger to me as my only company... It was very scary! Luckily my ex's friend was decent. \n\nDo you understand the danger you left your wife in? You didn't give details on the joke so it's hard to judge whether you were the asshole in that case.

I won't be surprised if she completely reevaluates everything after that.", "YTA. First of all - missing reasons. The joke must have been pretty bad for you to leave it out of your story. Seems like you are responsible for ruining the mood, not her.\n\nSecond, even though Japan is pretty safe (I'm a woman and lived there 3.5 years so know firsthand) Tokyo is a huge city with lots of trainlines, their address system is bonkers (everyone has to get around with minimaps and landmarks) it's easy to get lost, and when I was by myself I still got harassed a couple times by strange men - one blatantly asking me for sex.\n\nYou don't abandon your partner when thet aren't sure how to get home, especially in a foreign country. If you were my partner, the relationship would have ended when you stepped foot outside Disneyland.", "Wowwww. Yes YTA, you need to sort your anger issues out, being stubborn is not more important than being kind. You sound awful and I honestly hope this is the red flag that pushes her to leave you. \n\nYou got soooo angry that your wife had feelings that you acted like a stubborn nasty little child and left her in an extremely vulnerable position in a foreign country with no phone and no way to get back into the hotel!! Wtf is wrong with you. Being \u2018right\u2019 in an argument is never an excuse to put the other person in danger. \n\nYou\u2019ve shown her how selfish you are. What a nasty, nasty man \ud83e\udd2e", "YTA.  Regardless of argument you abandoned your wife in an unknown environment without any thought for her safety or knowing how she was going to get back to the hotel.

That said, what an immature baby you are. My mom got lost with us in Tokyo when we went there (also went to Disney) and it\u2019s really really hard as a foreigner to a)actually get a Japanese person to stop on the sidewalk for you and b) find a random Japanese person that speaks English well enough to give you directions, even employees at Disneyland aren\u2019t reliable in terms of being able to speak English. Also, you\u2019re not entitled to your apology being accepted, get over yourself. \n\nYTA", "Omg, YTA.\n\nI'm positive this will end up on amithedevil and maybe amitheEx.\n\nYou're kind of a monster.", "Ofcourse YTA. You told an offensive joke and then abandoned your wife all alone in a foreign country at Disneyland no less which is supposed to be a happy place. So now everytime she thinks of Disney the memories will be tainted. \n\nAlso noone mentioned this but no only did you leave the park, you didn't TELL HER you left the park! You left her to figure out where you were. You didn't even have the decency to say I'm going back to the hotel to cool off. You just left. She had to deduce it herself that you had gone back to the hotel. \n\nAnd she's a woman. Do you know how scary it is to be a woman alone anywhere let alone in a foreign country?

You hurt her feelings, but instead of making her feel better, you make it 1000 times worse and try to make her out to be the crazy one??? YTA. What the hell is wrong with you???", "This has got to be fake", "Jeez bud you really need to ask this? You escalated this for no reason. All you had to do was apologize. Stick it out with her and leave together. What you did is pretty much a red flag. Yta", "The joke is relevant and should be placed in here verbatim. Without it you are concealing aggravating information in an attempt to minimize your actions.", "YTA- Let\u2019s see you made a crappy joke at your wife\u2019s expense. Then abandoned her in a foreign country along way from the hotel without leaving her a key or any transportation. And you got butt hurt because she hasn\u2019t forgiven you?", "I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that the joke was only mildly distasteful and tell you that even then, you're the asshole.   \nYou told a joke, presumably in good faith (once again, benefit of the doubt). It hurt your wife. It is possible to hurt people with your actions even when you did not mean to hurt them. In those cases it is still your fault that they are hurt and you apologize. You don't get pissed at them for being mad at you. You keep saying you apologized but the 'I said sorry so she should drop it' logic starts very early in the story so I'm getting the vibe that you said something along the lines of 'ok ok I'm sorry' without making her feel like you meant it. It sounds like the whole way through you were just pushing her to drop it, ignoring the fact that she was hurt. You can't expect to hurt someone and then be 'alright I'm sorry' and expect them to say 'oh everything is fine then'. It takes time for them to process their hurt and you need to demonstrate that you understand what you did and genuinely regret it.   \nHere's an example: \"Hey, I hadn't thought it through when I made the joke but I understand now that it \\[specific reason it was hurtful to her, e.g. 'reminded you of your dead grandma'\\] and so I should have known better. I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to. What do you need right now to feel better?\"   \nThe whole thing escalated because you didnt take her hurt seriously.  \nI'll grant you that you could not have known her phone would run out but leaving an upset partner in a foreign country when you have both hotel keys is also a major dick move.", "Hey OP, I can understand your frustration towards your wife. However, try to look at things from her perspective. Whatever the joke was, must have really hurt her. Sit down with her with a cool and rational mindset and try to understand what upset her. \n\nAlso, leaving her alone in the park was the wrong move. She\u2019s in a foreign country and is completely alone with no phone. This could have resulted in a very serious situation quickly. Japan has a high rate of sexual assault towards women, and most people do not intervene in that culture. The whole scenario could have taken a completely different route.\n\nThe best you can do is sit down and listen. Just try to understand her feelings and explain yours too. After that\u2019s settled, ask her how can you start building her trust again.\n\nGood luck \ud83e\udeb7", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We had been in Japan for two weeks and up until then everything was pretty much okay. We had a lot of fun travelling around the country (we are from Europe btw). \r  \nIn the afternoon as we we're waiting in line, she asked me to tell a joke. So I told one and that joke apparently hurt her feelings. She was upset and went quiet. \r  \nI told her I was sorry but she didn't accept my apology. She told me how that hurt her feelings and that I shouldn't be telling jokes like that. I was pissed why she couldn't just let it go and stopped talking to her. The mood worsened and she suggested that we separate for a moment so that everyone could calm down. After about 15 minutes she sent me a text message asking me to meet up. When I met her we got into a huge argument where she told me she was sad because there is always a bit of truth behind a joke and how my \"joke\"  ruined her mood. I asked her why she always felt the need to push it and that I told her I was sorry before. \r  \nI told her that she was no fun to be with, got up and left the park. She sent me a text asking me if I was leaving her alone at the park to which I didn't reply. \r  \nShe then called me and was crying on the phone. I asked if she could finally pull herself together? She didn't reply, I asked again but she only asked crying If I was seriously leaving her alone like that and to stop yelling at her. She drove me mad. She apologized for calling, I told her \"nice try but that's not working\" and we hung up. \r  \nI went back to the hotel and when she came back about 3 hours later she didn't talk to me. She took a shower and then told me she couldn't believe that I left her alone at the park, in a foreign country, with no cellphone (her phone died after our call). That she didn't know how to get back to the hotel (the park was an hour away), and when she finally found the hotel that she couldn't get in because I had both keys, so she had to ask other people to help her out and that she felt abandened by me. We had another argument, I told her my view and she suggested we put the matter aside as we had a long way home the next day. \r  \nWe've been home for 2 days now and we only talk to each other the bare minimum. She only told me that her trust in me was broken and that family never leaves someone behind, especially not in a foreign country. That I didn't care about what happened to her.  \r  \nI don't think that I did something wrong? Maybe I really shouldn't have left her behind like that but she kind of deserved it. She should have just accepted my apology and pulled herself together. \r  \n\r  \nTldr: My wife and I got into an argument on vacation and I left her alone and went back to the hotel. She is now angry with me for abandoning her in a foreign country, telling me her trust in me is broken. \r  \n\r  \nSo AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
