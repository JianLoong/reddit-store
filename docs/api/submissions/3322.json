Yes, it absolutely can be the case.

Company has zero relevance. Having permission to have her over does not mean permission to be loud. Yes, she can give permission and throw conditions on top of that, she can also make the rule that you can't be loud, period. \n\nYou have no right to dictate that you will keep people awake. \n\n> When I got home and got off work, I told my mom that I was cutting ties with her, \n\nCutting ties means moving out too. \n\n> she unplugged my Xbox and threw it into the garbage saying that if I have an attitude, then I don\u2019t need to use the things she\u2019s paying for. \n\nShe should have sold it. \n\n> I got upset and I told her that I was never speaking to her again and that I would be reporting her for harassment and filing a police report. She is now trying to have me put out and taken off the lease.\n\nGood luck. She has a stronger claim to harassment as you were disturbing her sleep. Sleep is a necessity. She didn't harass you by expecting you to not violate her sleep. \n\nLiterally all you had to do was be quieter. \n\nI had an ex who would keep me up at night by loudly gaming. My health was suffering due to sleep deprivation. If you can't be quiet then you really don't need anything that has the potential to be loud. \n\nLiving with her is a privilege. Living with anyone is. Keeping people awake is not a right and can be plenty illegal in many cases.", "Damn\u2026 narc\u2019d on your own momma.

But he didn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t even drive himself to work and didn\u2019t pay for his own Xbox. I doubt he\u2019s paying bills", "I don\u2019t think \u201cpermission\u201d and \u201clease\u201d are the same thing", "That can sometimes be a legal requirement for anyone over 18 to be included on a lease, including children of the primary lease holder. Being on the lease doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he is paying rent.", "he never states he is on the lease. since he can not pay for his own xbox, that would be weird too.\nAlso landlords don't just add people to the lease, to avoid legal complications.", "In his comments he said she said it's because they're having lout sex. According to him they're quiet", "Wow.  So you won't have a place nor will your mother. Good job", "Please explain what she has done that is a crime. I\u2019ll wait.", "Why not to the United Nations Security Council?", "That's the dumbest thing you could do. Do it and tell us where it gets you.", "To accomplish... What exactly? How are you going to cut ties if you can't even move out?", "Bwahahahaha!\n\nTell me you're white without telling me you're white.  \n\nThat's precisely what the police are there for.  Please, do take video of when you go down to the police department to tell them you want to report your mommy who subsidizes your entire life, pays for your video games, and drives you to work for harassment because she told you to stop sexing up your girlfriend so loudly.  That should be a good time for all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.  Grow up.  Move out.", "Are you on the lease  or paying rent?", "is that not illegal? to call 911 without a good enough reason? our local laws fine it, to a max off 8100 euro. (first offences get less) if you keep at it, you can get up to 3 months off jail time.", "he could be on the lease as dependant.", "That\u2019s even worse. If she knew y\u2019all were noodling you were doing it too loud", "You haven\u2019t answered anyone who asked if you pay rent. That\u2019s telling me you don\u2019t.", "Important question here. Do you pay an equal share of rent and utilities?", "Maybe you just think you're not being loud. It happens.", "Someone talking on the phone with their friends sounds nothing like someone having sex. She heard you, dude. That\u2019s another layer on the shit cake, you kept her up *having sex*.", "It doesn't matter. She told you to quiet down. She asked your girlfriend to leave and put her out which is her right. She is not obligated to house an 18 year old or to put up with her while you are at work. She is not obligated to house you either. \n\nShe didn't harass you or your girlfriend. You continued to argue and be disrespectful and likely filed a false police report. Hopefully the consequence of being homeless will be a lesson in your respect and you will learn to act like an adult.", "If she knows you were being intimate, you were being loud", "If she says she could hear you guys fucking and yall were actually fucking, guess what you were being too loud. You honestly completely overreacted if that's the case because other parents wouldn't have just asked you to keep it down tbh. YTA.", "Talking and intimacy are not confusable, they don't sound even remotely similar. \n\nAnd intimacy gets pretty loud even when \"quiet\". The bed 100% of the time will make noises and intimacy can always be heard through the floor. \n\nIf she knows you were being intimate, then you were very loud. How else would she know that you were being intimate? It's because she heard it.\n\nAnd literally all you had to do was be quiet. You do not dictate if you are quiet, if she says she hears you, then yes, she is hearing you be intimate.", "I feel bad for the coworkers.", "Last sentence", "The last sentence.", "you can be on the lease as dependant.", "That part wasn\u2019t added until later, also being on the lease doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s paying rent, from how he worded everything so far his mother pays for everything even his hobbies", "could be he is on the lease as dependent. some places require that (weird i know, but we do not know if he lives in one off them)", "I live with my 23 your old son. No way would I yell at his guests and throw their bag outside. You're right. We don't know whether there was a conversation between mom and gf. If gf got nasty with mom, then throwing her out would be normal. \n\nHe described the gf as not even coimg out of the room except to use the bathroom while he was at work. So it doesn't sound like the gf was interested in a confrontation.\n\nMom sounds petty and childish. She allowed the gf to come over. Then attacks her while her son is at work. Mom sounds unhinged and looking for an excuse to get rid of them both.\n\nAlso a teenager/20 something, doesn't have the same life experience and thought process as their parents. Mom should have been the bigger person and tried to be more reasonable with her son.", "Not necessarily. \n\nMost leases require you to list other full-time occupants, so the mother could been saying that she is taking him off as an occupant.  That is not the same thing as being a co-tenants or co-signers on the lease saying you accept full financial responsibility and having the same legal rights.  There isn't enough information to know which one is the case in this situation.", "It\u2019s the last sentence so maybe it was edited in.", "The lease is mentioned in the last sentence.", ">She is now trying to have me put out and taken off the lease.\n\nI read the post...", "[deleted]", "And driving him to work \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Bruh he can\u2019t even afford an Xbox.", "INFO: OP, are you paying for this lease as well?\n\nObviously that would obviously change the dynamics of \"her house, her rules\"", "Maybe i misread then but i swore it said she\u2019s trying to remove him from the lease", "> She is now trying to have me put out and taken off the lease.\n\nIt's literally the last line of the post.", "Either way if she asked him to quiet down then he should have been respectful and do that instead of being like nope I\u2019m quiet so she has no right to ask me to be quieter.", "Pretty sure the mom will be fine in her place when both the landlord and police laugh in this kids face.", "Maybe he should write to Santa Claus and get Mom on the naughty list.", "tell you mentioned the police i though you guest white because other option would go for ass whoping\ud83d\ude1c", "Literally was my thought lmaooo. If I was paying rent in this situation thatd be the first thing I typed", "was not in the original post.", "being on the lease as a payee vs. a dependent are separate - we don't know.", "I was not aware of this.

It's the last line of the post.", "OOP added that line in later, I went to the autobot to see the original post, it didn\u2019t have the last sentence about being taken off the lease nor being kicked out", "i reread it several times, and never even seen the word lease. \n\nPermission is not lease offcourse, nor is revoking permission taking him off the lease.", "Apparently it was edited in.", "OP edited that in there.  OP is an absolute dip-shit.", "Without a doubt.", "Maybe he added it so it would seem he has a leg to stand on \ud83e\udd14", "Definitely - probably why several of us have asked if he\u2019s paying rent.", "at least mother is trying to put him out. That shows she can pay just fine even if he contributes a little.
