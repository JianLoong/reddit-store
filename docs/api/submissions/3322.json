Yes, it absolutely can be the case.

Company has zero relevance. Having permission to have her over does not mean permission to be loud. Yes, she can give permission and throw conditions on top of that, she can also make the rule that you can't be loud, period. \n\nYou have no right to dictate that you will keep people awake. \n\n> When I got home and got off work, I told my mom that I was cutting ties with her, \n\nCutting ties means moving out too. \n\n> she unplugged my Xbox and threw it into the garbage saying that if I have an attitude, then I don\u2019t need to use the things she\u2019s paying for. \n\nShe should have sold it. \n\n> I got upset and I told her that I was never speaking to her again and that I would be reporting her for harassment and filing a police report.

She didn't harass you by expecting you to not violate her sleep. \n\nLiterally all you had to do was be quieter. \n\nI had an ex who would keep me up at night by loudly gaming. My health was suffering due to sleep deprivation. If you can't be quiet then you really don't need anything that has the potential to be loud. \n\nLiving with her is a privilege. Living with anyone is. Keeping people awake is not a right and can be plenty illegal in many cases.", "Damn\u2026 narc\u2019d on your own momma.

That would be considered theft, though my guess is the police would try very hard to avoid bringing a case like that to a prosecutor.\n\nAs for reporting her to the landlord, the outcome would probably be everyone getting evicted because no landlord would want to deal with their drama and the girlfriend staying over like that would likely give them enough reason to legally evict them.", "How about The Hague!", "thank you for the laugh", "Actually, I would be if it was my xbox!", "Right, not drive himself to work or the girlfriend drive him to work.... How'd she get there? Time to grow up boy!!", "He\u2019s on the lease, so says the post. It\u2019s also, his home.", "Dude admitted he had no where to go and therefore likely he can't afford it.", "Probably not, since mommy wouldn\u2019t drive him across the street. Sat outside the door and thought, \u201cThis will show her!\u201d", "People who think they\u2019re having quiet sex can sure get loud.", "I mean that\u2019s technically playing a game demanding on what one is into.", "All the time, you might not think you\u2019re loud, and then you walk out of your apartment, and the neighbors giving you knowing looks\u2026.", "Meanwhile I'm the kind of person that will call the non-emergency number even if I'm dying, don't wanna hold up the emergency line for people that need it", "No. If they false-report a kidnapping through dispatch and cause a city-wide manhunt that ends up being a custody dispute, yes probably. But this exact situation would likely get dispatched as a \u201cdomestic dispute\u201d and where I work it would be a requirement that two patrol officers physically go and make sure everything is okay because domestics lead to a lot of murders. Usually it\u2019s a colossal waste of time because you can\u2019t do anything (a crime hasn\u2019t taken place), but you have to physically go every time, even if you know it\u2019s BS. These happen all the time and most departments I know of make it policy that someone gets dispatched when any dispute dispute is called in.", "Honestly, there should be harsher fines, but mostly people get away with it. \n\nWe make a report and flag it as BS (in my jurisdiction) while we politely tell OP to use better judgment before calling 911. \n\nIf you make BS calls twice a week, eventually you can be charged. \n\nWe keep record and we HATE you, but our hands are tied. \n\nI guarantee that if OP keeps doing this, and is on the \u201cfrequent caller\u201d list, he\u2019ll either catch a charge, or be \u201cboy who cried wolf\u201d when he needs it, because EMS has him flagged as a time waster.", "I generally agree with the statement that whoever pays the bills and is on the lease makes the rules (ethically) but depending on what state you're in as long as you're a legal adult resident you have the same rights of any other tenant whether or not you're on the lease assuming it abides by the terms of the lease. And that can even vary county by county or furthermore City by City.\n\nIt's a case of even if you're legally within your rights doesn't make you morally or ethically right. I feel like we're not getting the full story here.\n\nEdit: the last sentence literally says that op is on the lease. Which means they have all the same legal rights to the house as their mother and didn't even actually have to ask for permission for guests as long as their visits abide by the limits of the lease. Whether or not they pay the same amount on the lease is a personal problem but legally anybody on the lease has the same rights to guests even if the other tenants don't agree with having those guests over because legally in most states it only requires one tenant's permission.", "I understand that. In my area, if a name is on the lease, the individual has rights.", "Was about to say this exactly", "Ding ding ding! correct. Op is a bawl baby.", "That may indeed be correct in OP's jurisdiction. It wouldn't be in mine.", "Absolutely! Money talks and bullshit walks\u2026 if he is not paying rent, it\u2019s momma\u2019s house", "Got it, thanks", "It\u2019s still her Xbox she bought even if he used it. He obviously needs to learn the real world than gaming all day..", "> Even if she paid for it\n> That would be considered theft\n\nSerious question: are you 14 or younger?", "Yup", "But it\u2019s not his when mommie pay for it", "Fair point. Mom should have just sold it.", "Anyone over 18 has to be on the lease if they live in the home. Even your children, at least in my state", "Where does it say that in the post tho?", "But is he on the lease as a lease holder or occupant?   My guess is occupant.   Some apartments want a list of everyone living inside so their names are listen in the lease but are not signers or legally responsible for anything.", "LMAO - poor dude. He might have a better shot at complaining to the police that mom destroyed his X-Box than he'll have for complaining about mom kicking GF out. YTA...", "I admit that I am picturing this with an added stompy foot for emphasis.", "Even if you are paying rent, having loud sex with your gf while other people in the house are trying to sleep is still an AH move. No one wants to hear that, but a parent *really* doesn't want to be kept up listening to their kid have sex. Gross. If I was him I'd be really careful about being quiet just because I wouldn't want my mom hearing it anyway.", "My point was simply that his name being on the lease might simply a requirement by the leasing company as he is a dependent child over the age of 18. This scenario reads like a kid who is using a legal loophole to get his way.  (Clearly demonstrated by the fact that he isn\u2019t paying for his gaming system and probably not utilities or Internet as his mother pointed out) A secondary point that is being overlooked is he is clearly leaving his houseguest alone and unattended in the house when he leaves, suggesting she rarely leaves and she is another person living in the property without paying rent and not on the lease.  Her continued presence is likely a violation of the lease.", "While I get what you\u2019re saying, did OP say that they pay rent?\n\nBecause in a dispute between two tenants, the one *actually* paying the bill will get the landlords support.", "I understand that, and that is true in many jurisdictions. The issue just seems like he was placed on the lease by default as a dependent child over the age of 18, doesn\u2019t pay any rent or expenses and has essentially moved his girlfriend in who is not on the lease and also isn\u2019t paying rent. He even leaves his girlfriend in the house when he leaves to go to work. He is using a legal loophole to live off his mother for free while demanding tenant\u2019s rights.", "If that were the case he wouldn't need to ask permission. He's on the lease as a child/ occupant but not as a responsible party. I'd put money on it. Either way, she may have to evict him but he still won't have the right to have company if he's not a lessee....", "Most leases require anyone 18 or older who lives there to be on the lease, even if they aren't paying anything towards the lease.  \n\nThey do this so if they have to evict that apartment they have everyone's info to give to the court.", "Once you give someone something it is their property. That is how that works. She paid for it, but it belongs to OP. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t appear his gaming is the issue. He works. He may or may not contribute to the bills. That\u2019s unclear, though chances are he does given he\u2019s on the lease. In another comment OP explained that his mother was complaining about he and his girlfriend being intimate loud enough to disrupt her sleep.\n\nIt\u2019s clear OP and his mother are not handling living together well. Obviously he\u2019s been an asshole here, but some of his mother\u2019s behavior is troubling as well.", "It is of she gifted ot to him", "> She is now trying to have me put out and taken off the lease\n\nLast sentence of the post. \n\nEdit: I agree that OP is the AH though. It\u2019s possibly ESH though if OP is contributing equally financially, which I\u2019d think is unlikely at 20.", "Very last sentence of the post", "Op being on the lease because it is a legal requirement by the leasing company still gives him the same rights as anybody actively paying rent who is also on the lease unfortunately. But overall I agree with you. Like I said, being within your legal rights does not make you ethically or morally right. Also as a point of order Op did not give enough context to know the financial situation or what bills are paid by who although it definitely gave a biased (but likely at least semi accurate) view of what is presumed to be happening.", "My guess is the gaming console was a gift from his mother. Whether OP pays rent or not, it\u2019s still a dick move to keep up roommates by being noisy at night.\n\nNow, throwing a gift in the garbage like that isn\u2019t great behavior. My gut says they all suck. And OP\u2019s mother raised him this way. But that\u2019s just my gut saying that and not based on much clarification from OP so I\u2019m just not voting.", "I agree they'll get the landlord's support, but they may not get the law's. It depends on the jurisdiction.", "No op did not say he pays rent.", "My issue is with all of the folk assuming he pays no rent and therefore should have no rights. \n\nHowever, since I still haven't seen OP clarify whether he pays rent, there's little doubt in my mind he's a numpty, regardless. His mother isn't much better. IMO.", "Im 39. I live in my moms house & I pay rent... I ask to have people over. \n\n\n(Just FINALLY getting well enough to think about living alone again after 2 years of cancer treatment & recovery from a Stem Cell Transplant if anyone wonders)", "I checked to original text by the autobot. I guess I got here after Op edited it in.", "Someone being on the lease doesn\u2019t always mean they\u2019re paying rent.", "I thought OP was 20", "That\u2019s mom saying that tho right? \n\nSorry I\u2019m lost here", "You are correct. The financial situation is unclear, however his mother throwing out the game system she presumably paid for and saying he doesn\u2019t need to use things she pays for gives a pretty clear indication. Also, as his mother is clearly driving him to work, he apparently doesn\u2019t have a car either. This gives a distinct impression that he likely isn\u2019t paying for anything.", "I haven\u2019t voted either simply because this story comes across as some 20 year old who is flexing his adult rights to get his way while living off his mother and expecting her to continue paying his way while he does whatever he wants. It probably isn\u2019t how she raised him, but he has decided this is is hill. The 20 year old with the 18 year old \u201creserved\u201d girlfriend that hides in his room and doesn\u2019t leave when he goes to work? I\u2019ve been on Reddit long enough to see some marinara flags and Iranian Yoghurt in this story.", "As you should... or at least give a heads up.... considering your age permission may not be necessary but you are certainly being respectful.", "Congratulations on your recovery! \n\nI hope that your next steps to getting back on your feet and independent are successful. \n\nI had to move home for a few years after a stroke in my mid 20s and it was absolutely humbling (and disheartening at the time) to have to move back and be taken care of. \n\nYou\u2019ll get there, the hardest part of your journey is hopefully behind you!", "Yeah sorry his girlfriend is 18, I\u2019ll edit my comment. It\u2019s midnight here and I don\u2019t have my glasses on so I don\u2019t see well lol anyways at 20 it\u2019s more likely he could pay equally, but still not very likely.", "I\u2019m definitely trying to give him the benefit of the doubt without further information. He works and he\u2019s on the lease. Whether or not he pays rent would color the situation very differently.", "Like, even if she's at work & my BFF since I was 12 (27) years is coming to drop something off I tell her. It is technically her house. OP needs to hear this.", "I'm excited. My car broke & I got laid off the same week I first get diagnosed.\n\nI'm on track to get a car again in around 6 months. Move within a year. Every excited for freedom again!", "I agree...btw... I'm glad you're on the mend \u2764\ufe0f", "Thanks!"]}
