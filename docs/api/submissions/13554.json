I'm glad you have your granddad.\n\nI don't want to armchair diagnose but if you can research a neurologist who's well versed in migraines and ask your granddad to take you there. As common as migraines are, they're often missed, especially in female children. I had classic migraines since I was a toddler and the brain stem version that give me the symptoms you described since I was around 20. I saw many neurologists. I got the diagnosis of migraine at 25 when I was brought to the hospital with stroke symptoms that turned out to be a migraine with a rather rare Aura from and am currently in the process of getting the brain stem version properly diagnosed (my neurologist wants to make tests that rule out everything else first because the symptoms they bring could also be from a disorder you don't want to overlook). I could have been saved much trauma if there were better neurologists in the countryside town I grew up in. \n\nWhen it's not migraine, then there's certainly grounds to make some intense testing because your symptoms could be from something sinister. \n\nYour mom's comments make me very angry.", "Nta\n\nNot to be rude but your mom is neglecting you", "Nta and I hope you find the answer. I have vertigo migranes and it can be awful. Your grandpa is standing up for you and taking you seriously. Your mom is being horrid and deserves to get an earful.", "NTA.  Tell your grandfather and your mother you want to go to any specialist he can take you too.  You have a debilitating illness and need help!  I understand as this sound similar to a condition I had called Vestibular Neuronitis and I was stuck dizzy for over 3 months.  There are other inner ear conditions they can check you for as well.  I hope you get some relief soon!  Your mom needs to reflect and understand that not getting you the care you need is neglect and that's what your granddad was trying to say nicely while also offering to help so she doesn't get overwhelmed taking you to all the doctors.", "NTA you ruined nothing. Your mother is just showing herself to be something of a disappointment. Imagine raising a kid to adulthood only to find they lacked the common sense or empathy to get their child proper medical care - that\u2019s why he got upset.  Your grandfather is right. This level of effect on your life is not okay and she should have followed up with other doctors to figure it out.", "NTA Your grandpa is right. This is not normal. You do need  other opinions.\n\nFurthermore, just a tip- keep an eye on the dizzy spells and your period. If they coincide or get worse on your period, blood draws need to be timed right, or they might be missing something as simple as plummeting iron levels. I only bring this up because this was something that took a frustratingly long time for my own diagnosis. \n\nHowever, happening while standing frequently is actually a bit more concerning than that, and your grandpa is definitely right", "NTA. \n\nJust thought I'd make this recommendation based on personal experience and me finding myself in the symptoms you described. Has any doctor checked your heart? I am getting similar symptoms due to my heart valves being smaller than average, so when I do things like standing up fast or doing a lot of physical effort, the heart tries to pump more blood through the vessels than it can physically squeeze through the valves. Hence the brain doesn't get enough oxygen which causes the faint spells. Not sure if it's the same in your case but worth checking it out if no one looked at it from this angle so far.", "NTA. And not to be an armchair doc, but did they rule out anemia? I was around your age when I was diagnosed and unchecked it could cause a lot of dizziness and fatigue. Especially in females as it can get worse around that time of the month.", "hello I don't want to intrude but my daughter also has dizziness. we went to several doctors and found nothing. but it turned out that her balance organ does not work well on 1 side. a nose throat ear doctor can do that test", "Nta. My son had similar issues around your age, and we eventually got a diagnosis of vestibular (yes that's the correct spelling, not ventricular) migraine. Basically migraine with vertigo replacing head pain as a symptom. It was bad enough that he missed most of his last year of high school. Thankfully he outgrew it. But have a Google and see if it rings a bell.", "NTA.\n\nJust because the argument is about your condition/you, doesn't mean it's your fault. This argument was really about your mom and granddad's differing opinions about what should be done to help you. You haven't ruined their relationship - if they are as you say close, they've disagreed before but both behaved maturely enough to continue to nurture their relationship to the close one you see. That means they are mature enough to apologize or amend their behavior, and be adults about the situation despite arguing. You really don't have a lot to worry about here except yourself. \n\nAnd definitely go to see better doctors or specialists to make sure you don't have underlying conditions this is a symptom for, because constant dizziness like this is not normal and could be a sign of many, many varied things.", "NTA and your granddad was correct in his statement, that you need a consultation with a specialist.

I had two neurologists rule them out over the years which is why I got diagnosed so late. Which is why I said look for a specialist. I think the one I'm with now is my fourth, the second migraine specialist and the first good at his job. \n\nI don't mean to say it is brain stem migraines, but that it's something to look into.

Her response of \"don't stand up around grandad because she's getting an earful\" is completely unacceptable!  Your grandad is trying to be your advocate.

When grandpa comes don't ever let him know you're dizzy.  It will be your little secret.   Pretend the issue is solved for grandpa's sake.

That being said, I have dizziness for 2 reasons. One is low blood pressure. I can't jump up because I will get extremely dizzy and have passed out at times, I will also go completely blind for a few minutes. \nThe other reason  is my inner ear problems. That took a few years to figure out and only became clear when I started getting ringing in my ears. Which constant now. Ask your grandpa for help. Your grandpa has more experience in this. As a mom I know it can be scary navigating the medical system to get what you need to do for your kid. And unless your mom has severe anxiety. \nMy older son has autism. I realized that he wasn't quite right in the head at 18 months old and despite my parents and then husband at time insisting that there was nothing wrong with him, I as usual ignored them and took him to the doctor anyways. His doctor suspected autism but wasn't sure since it was too early to tell. He did agree that what my son did wasn't normal.", "Wait let me get this straight, your own mother was unable to find an answer for her own illness when she was your age for a while, and yet has the audacity to say you are?! NTA but your mother is! I'd honestly be looking into seeing if gramps can take you in, I'm so sorry youre dealing with all this.", "NTA.  You not only have a dizziness problem, you apparently have a Mom cares less problem.  Please note:  A good parent will move heaven and earth to make her child well.", "NTA. Get a second opinion and if you have to ask grandpa for help do it. Your neurological symptoms are unusual and dangerous. If I\u2019ve learned one thing in the past decade, it\u2019s this: Go to the doctor if you\u2019re sick for over 2 weeks. No matter what trade offs are involved. And go to a competent place. \n\nHard line. Go. Figure this thing out because your life is more important than this bickering and it will be soon forgotten once you\u2019re properly diagnosed. Don\u2019t be afraid to seek medical care because of money. Or drama. Figure this out.", "Another possibility, especially considering age and sex, is POTS.", "> A 16 year old should not be getting dizzy and fainting spells in general, let alone for 3 years straight.\n\nI'm an old guy, so I don't know enough about these things...

Menieres was ruled out for me, thankfully. I wouldn\u2019t limit caffeine and salt well. But symptoms from cervicogenic can be similar.", "Yes Pots is exactly like this for my teenager. If she stands up quickly she will get dizzy every time.", "Believe it or not, every 2nd level test came back non-thalassemia however through process of elimination he said it was the only available diagnosis.  He also said that if we wanted to get the 3rd level of test that it would be expensive and wouldn\u2019t change the diagnosis.  Her official medical diagnosis is Thalassemia.  The cure for her is prescription level iron pills & vitamin D (strangely simple) but it\u2019s very important to note for any future injuries / surgeries / etc as she will have problems and the hospital should have blood on hand for her just in case.  \n\nThalassemia (well, her kind.  There are actually 4 kinds) means your blood vessels are too small and don\u2019t carry enough iron for your body  which I believe (i haven\u2019t thought about this in a while) means your body also doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen and causes the fainting /dizziness.

I still feel bad that my kid fell off of the top of a swing set and hurt herself a million years ago.  :)", "I\u2019m going to give you a little more info and another nudge to get tested.  I have a family member (diagnosed in high school, similar to my daughter) who had hemochromatosis.  It\u2019s basically the opposite of thalassemia in that you have too much iron in your blood.  The symptoms are similar as too much is also bad.  It\u2019s more common in boys but it\u2019s much more dangerous to have too much iron instead of too little.  So\u2026 again, take my internet mom worry with a grain of salt but get yourself checked out and push for advanced tests.  His disease also didn\u2019t show on normal blood tests but his mom hounded the doctors until they finally figured it out.", "Also try a vestibular specialist. They are experts in conditions of the inner ear. I had terrible vertigo and was able to see a specialist who was able to diagnose exactly what was wrong then developed a routine that helped me get sorted. Sending hugs as it\u2019s so hard to have anything like this x", "Hi, thank you so much for these recommendations. I\u2019ve had a look at both and I have more symptoms of hemochromatosis rather than the thalassemia. What kind of doctor did your friend visit to get the diagnosis for her son?", "OP is in the UK, and therefore covered by the NHS so that's a non issue", "Just the normal doctor but when they told her the blood tests were fine she kept pushing \u2026 \u201cthen why is my kid dizzy\u2026 how do you explain this\u2026 could it be something else\u2026 what other test can you do to see what is going on \u2026 \u201d \u2026 over and over.  Sometimes you really do have to push.", "I'm also in the UK and sadly our nhs has been so cut by the government that she might not be seen or get fobbed off.

And it's nearly impossible to \"see\" a lung infection.  Plus, lasts for months.  There were days I didn't dare try to walk.  Was told by a doctor I was faking, because they couldn't find anything wrong.  However, heart medication did help me manage the vertigo and function while we waited for my lungs to heal.  Hopefully this is something similar and will slowly improve.  NTA", "Ask your grandfather for help with a doctor. It could be anything from low blood pressure to anemia. It could also be what my husband had, benign positional vertigo, which is perfectly fixable. Don't worry about the arguments. Everything will settle again once there's a diagnosis and treatment plan. The important thing is to get to a decent doctor, and it sounds like your grandfather is good at finding the right ones.\n\nNTA", "Dizziness with a loss of sensation in limbs is nothing to take lightly. Your grandads right hun.\n\nYou need a complete work-up And your mum needs to be pushing for more from the doctors.\n\nHave they at least given you a blood test to check for anaemia, thyroid or diabetes?", "NTA, but OP, see if you can have an ear specialist check for dislodged crystals.  There are certain physiotherapy maneuvers that can help alleviate it hugely if that is the issue.", "Obviously NTA. When I was your age I had a similar issue with dizziness upon standing as did my sisters. Turns out we were anemic. A simple blood test could diagnose or just increase your iron and folic acid intake and see if that helps. Your grandpa is in the right, your mother needs to advocate for you and if she won't, let your grandad do it. There's no telling what long term damage you could be doing by not getting your illness treated. Also, dizziness in the wrong time or place could have really bad consequences.", "NTA. And please listen to grandpa and see a specialist.", "So NTA. My daughter was also suffering from dizziness especially when she would get up to quickly. I took her to emerg one night, nothing, the next day I took her to a children\u2019s hospital and turns out she has Tachycardia, which is a faster heart beat than normal. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin any relationship, please don\u2019t think that at all, you are not to blame. I would keep pressing the issue, even speaking to your grandfather about potentially taking you to get checked out. \n\nIn the mean time I can offer you a couple of suggestions that may help. When getting up from laying down or even sitting, do so slowly, give yourself a moment to regulate the change in position. Hydrate, this is important regardless. I hope you get answers really soon so that you do t have to deal with this any longer.", "Then don\u2019t dish out unfounded and sexist advice on the internet, wtf dude.", "Not from period unless you have fibroids and they are easy to diagnose.", "Sorry just jumping on to add have you had a brain scan?\n\nMy mum was misdiagnosed for years and it turned out her epilepsy was due to a benign brain tumour. \n\nYou need a proper work up and I'm afraid you just need to keep bugging Drs until you get an answer or the situation resolves."]}
