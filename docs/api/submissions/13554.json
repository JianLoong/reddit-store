It was your mother's obvious neglect that started it.", "NTA\n\nYour grandad is absolutely right, this could be a very serious conditions and your mom should be advocating for you, not dismissing you and joking that you're faking. She's playing with your health. She's \"getting an earful\" because she deserves it.\n\nHow can you deal with school like this? How are you going to work? Does your mom not see how terrible this is? Don't you?\n\nYou need health care sweety. If that means annoying your mom to death until she gets it to you, you should do that. This is your life.", "NTA. A 16 year old should not be getting dizzy and fainting spells in general, let alone for 3 years straight. If I were you I'd get up even more around your grandfather, perhaps even exaggerate a bit for good measure. Then maybe it'll convince your mom to actually do something about your health before it possibly gets worse.", "NTA - There's nothing you could have done.\n\nHaving said that, I don't think such debilitating dizziness is normal and you should push your parents to get a 2nd opinion, especially from a specialist.", "NTA  You didn't start this argument. You have something, currently unknown, affecting you and causing you to have dizzy spells which can leave you to be incapacitated for days. It seems to me that your mother is minimising this. Not only that she is minimising it to your granddad, and he from past experience knows how what she is doing is wrong. And I'm kinda shocked that she doesn't realise it herself. I'm assuming that you're in the UK and probably under the NHS and therefore they're probably not as quick or efficient as private medical care. You should talk to your granddad about what exactly is happening to you and see if he can help you out, because if he fought for your mum, he'll fight for you. \n\nI just can't get over your mother telling you to hide what's happening to you while your granddad is there, essentially because he will hold her accountable for her lack of action in helping you. He sounds like a good person with your best interests at heart, your mother though, well she's a different story.", "Oh, honey. None of this is your fault at all. Your mum is neglecting your health by minimizing your symptoms and not taking you to a specialist. NTA at all. Maybe your grandad can find a specialist and take you? Best wishes for your health.", "NTA - I have a condition called Menieres.     \nIt affects your inner ear.      \nI can be perfectly fine one minute and then drop like a stone the next.     \nI can go days when I simply can\u2019t stand without help.       \nYou can get it at any age.     \n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menieres-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374910\n\nLook at that.", "You didn\u2019t ruin it.

Your grandpa is sticking up for you and it's great he is supporting you. It's good that he brought up your mom's illness not being diagnosed until he went somewhere else. Maybe now your mom will actually help you instead of thinking it's either no big deal or you are faking. \n\nYou DID NOT START THE ARGUMENT, you were there, but you being dizzy due to a medical issue IS NOT YOUR FAULT. You did not just wake up one day and say to your body \"make me get dizzy all the time and never know what it is\" and then your body replied \"okay, lets just mess you up so your mom will be unhapoy\" did you??? No, you DID NOT, so HOW can it be YOUR FAULT??? You can't just NOT LIVE, or eat or move around!!! \n\nYour mom SHOULD be doing EVERYTHING in her power to find out what's wrong. It could be minor and easily fixed, or it could be something that you can control with daily meds, like low iron or a blood pressure issue, I'm not a doctor, but those two things have made ME dizzy, but it's probably not that. \n\nEither way, you getting dizzy FOR YEARS IS VERY BAD and your mom needs to get it together and help you. This IS MEDICAL/HEALTH NEGLECT and it is NOT OKAY. Your mom could get in LEGAL trouble for IGNORING your health problem FOR YEARS, and in my opinion, it would serve her right if she got in trouble with the law...not tossed in jail for days and weeks trouble, but arrested, let go,  then ordered to take parenting classes and do everything she can to get you the proper medical care you OBVIOUSLY NEED.  \n\nShe is NEGLECTING your SAFETY and HEALTH and that is NOT OKAY. \n\nOnce again, this IS NEGLECT, it is NOT your fault and it is NOT OKAY. Tell another adult your medical issues are being completely ignored by your mom and doctors and see if you can get help from a social services agency where you live...I am so sorry this is happening to you, I hope you can figure it out and get better very soon.", "This post makes my head spin.\n\nNTA \u267e\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nYou really need to talk to your mother about this, if what the grandpa said was true then this could be something important.

Wtf, you are NTA. I hope your grandpa can get you to the right specialist soon.", "NTA Your mother is asking you to downplay what you're experiencing because she's rightfully being called out for not being willing to get you the help you need, she's not willing to do for you, what was done for her when SHE had something similar happen.", "Honestly at 16 years old walk into A&E if your mum won\u2019t help you\n\nNTA", "Wow.

So not your fault!", "NTA I mean sure you were the topic of the conversation, but the argument didn't actually involve you, it was between your mum and your grandad. Though I am curious as to why your mum is refusing to take grandads advice about getting you some help, just telling you to \"stop standing up around him\" isn't gonna change the fact that you're still having dizzy episodes, you really should see a doctor about that especially at your age.\n\nBut anyway whatever issues are going on between mum and grandad is for them to sort out, seeing as how they're the adults in this situation, it's not your responsibility to patch things up on their behalf.", "NTA. Your grandad is awesome", "NTA. \n\ni have suffered through dizzy spells since i was 14-15. my mom never did take me to get seen, said it was my anxiety causing it. \n\nnow, age 22, i finally got diagnosed with POTS, the source of my dizziness. i understand your struggle and you did not start an argument about anything. that was all your mother.", "NTA. I'm glad you have your granddad.\n\nI don't want to armchair diagnose but if you can research a neurologist who's well versed in migraines and ask your granddad to take you there. As common as migraines are, they're often missed, especially in female children. I had classic migraines since I was a toddler and the brain stem version that give me the symptoms you described since I was around 20. I saw many neurologists. I got the diagnosis of migraine at 25 when I was brought to the hospital with stroke symptoms that turned out to be a migraine with a rather rare Aura from and am currently in the process of getting the brain stem version properly diagnosed (my neurologist wants to make tests that rule out everything else first because the symptoms they bring could also be from a disorder you don't want to overlook). I could have been saved much trauma if there were better neurologists in the countryside town I grew up in. \n\nWhen it's not migraine, then there's certainly grounds to make some intense testing because your symptoms could be from something sinister. \n\nYour mom's comments make me very angry.", "Nta\n\nNot to be rude but your mom is neglecting you", "Nta and I hope you find the answer. I have vertigo migranes and it can be awful. Your grandpa is standing up for you and taking you seriously. Your mom is being horrid and deserves to get an earful.", "NTA.  Tell your grandfather and your mother you want to go to any specialist he can take you too.  You have a debilitating illness and need help!  I understand as this sound similar to a condition I had called Vestibular Neuronitis and I was stuck dizzy for over 3 months.  There are other inner ear conditions they can check you for as well.  I hope you get some relief soon!  Your mom needs to reflect and understand that not getting you the care you need is neglect and that's what your granddad was trying to say nicely while also offering to help so she doesn't get overwhelmed taking you to all the doctors.", "NTA you ruined nothing. Your mother is just showing herself to be something of a disappointment. Imagine raising a kid to adulthood only to find they lacked the common sense or empathy to get their child proper medical care - that\u2019s why he got upset.  Your grandfather is right. This level of effect on your life is not okay and she should have followed up with other doctors to figure it out.", "NTA Your grandpa is right. This is not normal. You do need  other opinions.\n\nFurthermore, just a tip- keep an eye on the dizzy spells and your period. If they coincide or get worse on your period, blood draws need to be timed right, or they might be missing something as simple as plummeting iron levels. I only bring this up because this was something that took a frustratingly long time for my own diagnosis. \n\nHowever, happening while standing frequently is actually a bit more concerning than that, and your grandpa is definitely right", "NTA. \n\nJust thought I'd make this recommendation based on personal experience and me finding myself in the symptoms you described. Has any doctor checked your heart? I am getting similar symptoms due to my heart valves being smaller than average, so when I do things like standing up fast or doing a lot of physical effort, the heart tries to pump more blood through the vessels than it can physically squeeze through the valves. Hence the brain doesn't get enough oxygen which causes the faint spells. Not sure if it's the same in your case but worth checking it out if no one looked at it from this angle so far.", "NTA. And not to be an armchair doc, but did they rule out anemia? I was around your age when I was diagnosed and unchecked it could cause a lot of dizziness and fatigue. Especially in females as it can get worse around that time of the month.", "hello I don't want to intrude but my daughter also has dizziness. we went to several doctors and found nothing. but it turned out that her balance organ does not work well on 1 side. a nose throat ear doctor can do that test", "Nta. My son had similar issues around your age, and we eventually got a diagnosis of vestibular (yes that's the correct spelling, not ventricular) migraine. Basically migraine with vertigo replacing head pain as a symptom. It was bad enough that he missed most of his last year of high school. Thankfully he outgrew it. But have a Google and see if it rings a bell.", "NTA.\n\nJust because the argument is about your condition/you, doesn't mean it's your fault. This argument was really about your mom and granddad's differing opinions about what should be done to help you. You haven't ruined their relationship - if they are as you say close, they've disagreed before but both behaved maturely enough to continue to nurture their relationship to the close one you see. That means they are mature enough to apologize or amend their behavior, and be adults about the situation despite arguing. You really don't have a lot to worry about here except yourself. \n\nAnd definitely go to see better doctors or specialists to make sure you don't have underlying conditions this is a symptom for, because constant dizziness like this is not normal and could be a sign of many, many varied things.", "NTA and your granddad was correct in his statement, that you need a consultation with a specialist.  Three years is a long time to suffer from any ailment without intervention.  The only reason your mum was annoyed is because her dad called her out for not being proactive enough concerning your health condition.", "Your mom is an AH for her dismissal of a potential problem", ">Ask your Grandfather for help.\n\nI second this. It is unlikely or at least more difficult to change OPs mothers mind. And critical time might be lost.\n\nOP, ask your grandfather for help.", "This!  OP you\u2019re not at fault for any of this.  Your mom needs to step up and help you.\n\nNTA", "I wonder what that experience of the London specialist was like for the mom. Getting a proper medical diagnosis is great but it can come with a lot of tests and feeling isolated from your peers, which can leave its own trauma.\n\nNot that that excuses the mom's actions here, but it may explain them.", "I could tell you how parents can react like her mother or even worse, how schools react to this and how many years you can manage school and work until your body breaks down and you become too disabled to work but it would be painful to read. I hope her grandfather gets really old because I was in a similar situation and today I'm 30, disabled and very lucky my mom got rid of my father and takes care of me", "Don't exagerate op !!! But do tell your grandpa in your mother presence that you will go with him if he is willing to take you to specialists to find the cause of your illness.\n\nNTA", "Don\u2019t exaggerate - that\u2019s really bad advice", "Hi! I already have a neurologist as I have epilepsy and he said that it shouldn\u2019t be a migraine. But where I live, the specialists don\u2019t seem to have properly specialised in it", "Your neurologist could be the best for epilepsy (which I doubt because then he would do tons of exams to make sure this is not caused by the epilepsy) and still know jack shit about migraines. I had two neurologists rule them out over the years which is why I got diagnosed so late. Which is why I said look for a specialist. I think the one I'm with now is my fourth, the second migraine specialist and the first good at his job. \n\nI don't mean to say it is brain stem migraines, but that it's something to look into. And a good neurologist will rule certain other disorders out when checking if it's migraine so it's two flies in one go.\n\nAn endocrinologist could also be a good idea", "That does sound like a good idea, I\u2019ll run it by mum and see if she\u2019ll be open to it or not", "Tell your grandfather at the same time", "I will. Thank you so much for this recommendation:)", "I hope my ideas help you get some light into what ails you. If not I hope your grandfather looks further", "I honestly really appreciate your ideas and recommendations. Thank you so much", "You're welcome. Feel free to contact me for further ideas or tips on how to get proper medical help as a girl", "Okay, thank you and I might need to if my mum isn\u2019t budging with the whole situation"]}
