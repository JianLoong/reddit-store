Ryder (17M), India (14F) and Gray (13M). My sister lost her first husband 9 years ago and remarried 6 years ago. Her husband came into the marriage with two of his own kids, Tasha (9F) and Nate (7M).\n\nRyder has always been a creative kid and he does a lot of sketches and drawings. He's really good too. Over the years he has grown so much and become good enough that he makes some money doing art for people online. He has also gifted some family members drawings.\n\nA few weeks ago my sister was in the kids' rooms and noticed that India and Gray had drawings from their brother. Some of them were drawings of the family as though their dad was still alive, others of them as siblings and some of them and their best friend(s). She went into Ryder's room and saw drawings of her late husband as well as more that Ryder drew of them all with his dad around. There were none of her husband or stepkids.\n\nMy sister asked India and Gray where those drawings came from and they said Ryder gave them as gifts for Christmas some years and that he normally did that when it was just the three of them. They said they only decorated their rooms with them in the last few months.\n\nMy sister then confronted Ryder and asked why he was only gifting to his bio siblings and not his stepsiblings and why he didn't ever draw the blended family. He told her he didn't want to draw the blended family, he wanted to draw his family. She told him anyone looking at what he draws would think his dad was still alive. He pointed out to he adds RIP somewhere on his dad when he draws him. She told him it was still wrong and he should be doing more to include everyone in the drawings. Ryder said he would never draw them and the two fought. She told him he better start drawing everyone \"or else\".\n\nShe came to my house a few days ago and told me all about it and how Ryder had been fighting with her ever since. She said she considered waiting for him to draw and making sure he included his stepdad and stepsiblings. She even considered taking away all his art supplies. Over and over she told me that she wanted to get him to cut the shit and embrace the whole family in his art. I couldn't hold back from telling her she couldn't, and shouldn't, tell him what to draw. That his art is personal and he's being discreet when he gives some to his siblings. I also pointed out he has a lot of stuff he draws and she should focus on being proud of how good he is instead of turning his art into a battle. I reminded her that he's 17 and she won't win the battle, she'll simply push him away. This is when she cut me off and told me I had no right to interfere in her parenting and blended family and if I could not be supportive of her then I needed to shut my mouth. She ranted that I showed how little I give a fuck about the family and accused me of being a bitch.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696246408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xu8oq/aita_for_interfering_with_my_sisters_parenting/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well, many blended famillies. My parents divorced when i was 6 months old. I have a half sister from mom and her husband and an \"ex\" stepsister from dad.  \n\n I have very little relationship with my mother and 0 relarionship with her daughter and husband. With 2 of my stepmothers (i had 3) i talk even to this day. My stepsister is my soul sister. \n\n All this to say that you can't force sibling bonds. She is wrong for trying to force him to bond with these people. My mother tried to get us to bond with her husband and her daughter and now we want nothing to do with them, they're not part of our life. Your sister is heading into the same direction.", "NTA \n\nYour sister's going to find out the hard way that you're right. She's trying to force things then lashes out at him for not obeying her. And it seems to be her go to behavior. Look at how she acted when he didn't do what she wanted and compare it to how she acted with you.", "Ahhh. As the parent of a teen, I really feel for your sister. She's wrong, of course, but I feel for her. \n\nEverything you said is true. As a recommendation, I would also make it \"okay\" for your sister that your nephew expresses his grief that way, and it's not necessarily that he doesn't feel his \"new\" family isn't his \"real\" family. Although he may feel _exactly_ that way, and that, too, is completely ok. \n\nHer lashing out at you is her expressing her disappointment about his feelings. Feelings she CANNOT control. She likely thinks his feelings are somehow her fault (myriad options here; none relevant) and that she did something wrong because the family isn't bonded.\n\nYour sister needs to be encouraging behaviors of kindness, compassion, and understanding among all the siblings, not just your oldest nephew. \n\nThey feel what they feel. Period.\n\nNTA.", "NTA   you didnt interfere,  you gave your opinion when she came to you with a problem. \n\nAnd to make you even less the asshole your advice was good.", "This is such a sad situation. The kids, especially Ryder, lost their dad. That is so hard to cope with, and it feels like their mother refuses to allow them space to grieve. They can love and cherish their new family while still grieving their father. This is hard both from them and your sister. Yes, she\u2019s in the wrong, but I can sympathize with her. NTA and definitely keep beating on that drum. The kids need a safe space to mourn the loss of their father and the family that could have been. Hopefully your sister will see that before she alienates her kids.", "NTA, you are right, sis is on her way of alienating her bio kids, especially Ryder, and only has herself to blame.\n\nIt's so crappy of her to threaten with the taking away of supplies!", "NTA!\nRyder will end up going no contact pretty soon if she continues this behaviour with him.", "NTA \n\nBut your sister? Wow\n\nI would quietly take Ryder aside and tell him you understand his feelings and what his drawings mean to him and his sibs. That you support his decisions to draw what's in his heart, and that you don't agree with your sisters (quite horrible) view. And that you'll always be there for him.\n\nI have a feeling he's going to need you very soon. Thanks for being an empathetic Auntie", "NTA.\n\nYou would have been TA if this was totally unprompted advice. But this was in response to your sister unloading on you about this. You could have tried to say you wanted to change the subject, had to go, or made whatever excuse and not said anything. Depending on exactly how things went, context, tone, etc. that might have been easy or it could have been pretty challenging. You recognize that unsolicited advice is often problematic. But we are all human. Sometimes when someone is in the wrong (as your sister is here) and won\u2019t shut up about it, you just have to say something. It would be hard to just sit and listen to her justify screwing up her relationship with her son.", "NTA. Tell your nephew to bring all of his art supplies and special drawings to your house. And you keep them safe for him until he can move. When he is 18 he can come over whenever he wants to draw in peace. I am shocked at the amount of parents who thing they can tell someone what to do with a personal talent. I am confused as to why they feel they can dictate journals entries, art, photos, etc.", "\u201cI couldn\u2019t hold back\u201d \u2026. You voiced your opinion. Your sister told you she doesn\u2019t want to hear it. Why does it matter who is the ah in the situation? \n\nShe was venting to you about her child (she can do that) & didn\u2019t ask for your help or opinion. Maybe she will reflect on what you said & hopefully what you said will help guide her in dealing with this situation. However, her children are her responsibility & you don\u2019t get a vote on how she is raising them. Ryder is 17 & has the ability to speak for himself. That\u2019s the only person your sister needs to be listening to. \n\nYTA \u2014 next time all you need to say is \u201chow can I help?

It's selfish! Her son has every right to draw his dad however he wants. She will push him away by behaving that way. He might be gone, but his dad is still his dad. And she has no control over who he draws. Wow, take away his art supplies?! What an awful attitude.  He's 17, not a little kid. If anything, she will destroy any relationship they have. Plus, she brought all that to you, then gets mad when you do side with her.  Again, selfish!", "Yes, and OP please be there for and make sure Ryder knows that you love, support, and will be there for him.", "Being a yes man will only make the situation worse. Sometimes people need to be told when they're wrong. If I heard someone say they were gonna toss their kid's hobby items for not doing what they say (emotional abuse) I'd say something too. Op is NTA.", "Friends and family should be able to tell you you're being an asshole without getting shouted at. And her Sister is most Def being an asshole and about to lose her son", "It is never a good plan to offer unsolicited advice about other people\u2019s parenting or marriage. No one is privy to everything that goes on behind closed doors in another person\u2019s home. This is one scenario in this family\u2019s life. Who knows what is actually happening here. \n\nMy sisters & I have 8 kids between us. We step on each other\u2019s toes about parenting all the time. We also get told to shut the hell up. So we shut the hell up. Doesn\u2019t make my sister the ah if she\u2019s not ready/willing to hear another person\u2019s opinion. Being kind means being honest & accepting others may not be ready to hear it.\n\nIn this case, OP wants to be right & wants sister to be wrong. That\u2019s not being kind.", "NTA \n\nPoor Ryder :/\n\nYour sister is a horrible mom. No exaggeration your sister sucks. What a raging narcissist like Ryder doesn\u2019t owe HER CHOICES anything and he sounds like a perfectly sweet kid with no malice just wants to draw like god damn lady how evil can a person be", "NTA and your sister is a major asshole.  She's thinking of taking away her kid's joy and hobby because he won't draw the blended family.  That's a good way to guarantee her kids will bolt as soon as they turn 18.\n\nIf you can offer your niece and nephews a safe place and a friendly ear.\n\nI hate people like your sister.  Being in a blended family is difficult enough without your parents being abusive and shoving relationships down your throat", "Sister obviously doesn't read this sub-Reddit. The blended family debacle is about 25% of all the issues here. And it is ALWAYS about parents trying to force the new family into a Brady Bunch fantasy family. And people are here complaining that forcing the issue NEVER WORKS.\n\nYou're NTA, but your sister will be back, asking for advice when Ryder leaves hone, never to return, followed by his siblings, as soon as they're old enough. You might reach out to Ryder and offer a safe haven, especially if he's going to need to hide his art supplies before his mom confiscates them.", "NTA, she asked for your opinion and when it doesn't align to hers she claims you're a bitch for interfering with her parenting? She is the ah, not you, and you are right, Ryder's art is personal and he can't be forced to draw things he doesn't want to. You can't force a family on someone, and you can't force a child to forget his dead parent. She should be proud of his talent and nurture it instead of showing that her new husband and step kids are more important than him and his feelings.\n\n I really hope for Ryder's sake that things will get better with his mother, but seeing her overreaction I doubt it.", "You sister is an idiot who is more concerned about optics than about actual blending the family together, but honestly it's probably too late to salvage her relationship with her oldest. It seems they've learned awhile back to hide any appreciation for their bio family from her.", "NTA - He will end up cutting her off for doing things like this and then she will be crying about she doesn't know where she went wrong or why her oldest never comes around. Had the stepkids came to her about being left out of his drawings I could see why she might try to have a conversation about being more inclusive, but that's not the case here. It seems that he gives the drawings to his siblings discreetly and she didn't even know this had been going on, much less the other kids knowing or saying something about it. She needs to let him draw what he wants, and kudos for being a good aunt and standing up for your nephew.", "NTA.\n\nIf your sister really wants a picture of the entire family, she could commission Ryder to draw one.  No one should expect an artist to work for free, after all.  If she pays for his art, that will show that she thinks his work is valuable and may help repair her relationship with him.", "NTA but your sister sure is. She's got it all messed up in her head.", "NTA. \n\nPlease hold on to his pictures and art materials for him though. \n\nI worry what mom might do to them.", "NTA if you have a guest bedroom maybe set it up for Ryder.

All you\u2019re basically trying to do is save her and him some heartache. If she keeps pushing him, he\u2019ll cut her off.", "your sister is TA..  She is going to push him away and make it so he resents those kids.", "NTA- your sister asked for your opinion, which you gave.\nIt\u2019s not your fault she is asking questions that she knows the answer to and doesn\u2019t want to hear the truth.", "She figures she can muffle his feelings for her own convenience.    Brilliant.   Hes using his art to express how he feels - and to show solidarity with his biosibs.   Moms going to drive him away forever.   NTA for trying to save a family.", "This should be higher. OP, your sister is actively planning to take away something important to Ryder for the sake of her own feelings and opinions. Odds are, he will need somewhere safe for himself and his art.\n\nNTA.", "Op's sister literally said she wants to take away Ryder's art supplies because he won't draw a perfect blended family. Ryder already told his mom how he felt and sister clearly isn't listening.  Someone had to say it", "Go ahead say whatever you want. Doesn\u2019t mean other people have to listen & they can literally say I don\u2019t want to hear it. Sometimes people want to just bitch about a problem. Perhaps this goes no further & sister never says anything to her son. \n\nThe question is OP an ah for interfering in her sister\u2019s parenting. Well her sister already told her she is. Sister doesn\u2019t want to hear her opinion. What more does anyone need to know. Doesn\u2019t matter what Reddit thinks. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to agree with her sister & also doesn\u2019t need to \u201cfix\u201d sister\u2019s problems. Sister is an adult & is free to make her own choices. She will also have to deal with the consequences of those choices.", "If you believe everything you said, why are you in a group where people decide who TA is? Doesn't matter what reddit thinks right? Also no one said her sister had to listen to her lol. Nothing you wrote changes what I said", "It\u2019s never a good plan to be a bad mom either, and yet here OP\u2019s sister is.", "This is not about being kind ...this is about OP sister needing a reality check ...before she ruins her relationship with her son .", "I at not arguing about what you said. OP asked if she was the ah \u2026 I think she is for asking the question. Appears what she is really asking is was she right. I don\u2019t think she gave her sister bad advice but sister still doesn\u2019t want to hear it. So stop talking.", "Ah yes \u2026 because parents can never have an emotional outburst or say something ridiculous when they are upset about something they don\u2019t like that their kids are doing. Certainly feel free to judge her on this one situation that is being reported by someone other than Mom. \n\nPerhaps sister just wanted to bitch & be pissed off because her kid is doing something she doesn\u2019t love. Then maybe she got home & all was right with the world again.", "A single outburst is one thing.  Saying you are still thinking of punishing your kid when they did nothing wrong isn't a single emotional outburst", "NTA, you didn't even tell her how poor a parent she is for not even asking her son how was he feeling about the blended family and instead wanting to force it down his throat.\nYou didn't even tell her her son is 17 and if she keeps like this he'll do the whole college + NC + setting the example for the other siblings pat.\nAnd you didn't even cursed her the way she deserved!", "IS your sister triying to make Ryder run away as soon as he can? Because is what Will happen at this rate", "NTA\n\nHowever, I'd get in touch with your nephew and lend him both your support and a forewarning of how much this situation is escalating with his mother. Is it undercutting her? Yes, but she's already contemplating abusive levels of controlling forced \"blending\" of her family, and thus is beyond all hope. Plus, your nephew is his own whole ass person, and not a marionette for your sister, and he deserves someone to be in his corner.", "NTA.  Please reach out to Ryder though as he may need some help if not just an ear to hear his feelings and confirm that he is right and she is wrong.", "NTA\n\nRyder is going to ride away with his art supplies when he turns 18 ASAP.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOffer to ryder to stax with you  - he might need a place to crash when he escapes fro, your abusive sister.", "NTA.
