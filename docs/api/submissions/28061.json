{"id": 28061, "submission_id": "16xu8oq", "title": "AITA for interfering with my sister's parenting and handling of her blended family?", "selftext": "My sister has three kids from her first marriage. Ryder (17M), India (14F) and Gray (13M). My sister lost her first husband 9 years ago and remarried 6 years ago. Her husband came into the marriage with two of his own kids, Tasha (9F) and Nate (7M).\n\nRyder has always been a creative kid and he does a lot of sketches and drawings. He's really good too. Over the years he has grown so much and become good enough that he makes some money doing art for people online. He has also gifted some family members drawings.\n\nA few weeks ago my sister was in the kids' rooms and noticed that India and Gray had drawings from their brother. Some of them were drawings of the family as though their dad was still alive, others of them as siblings and some of them and their best friend(s). She went into Ryder's room and saw drawings of her late husband as well as more that Ryder drew of them all with his dad around. There were none of her husband or stepkids.\n\nMy sister asked India and Gray where those drawings came from and they said Ryder gave them as gifts for Christmas some years and that he normally did that when it was just the three of them. They said they only decorated their rooms with them in the last few months.\n\nMy sister then confronted Ryder and asked why he was only gifting to his bio siblings and not his stepsiblings and why he didn't ever draw the blended family. He told her he didn't want to draw the blended family, he wanted to draw his family. She told him anyone looking at what he draws would think his dad was still alive. He pointed out to he adds RIP somewhere on his dad when he draws him. She told him it was still wrong and he should be doing more to include everyone in the drawings. Ryder said he would never draw them and the two fought. She told him he better start drawing everyone \"or else\".\n\nShe came to my house a few days ago and told me all about it and how Ryder had been fighting with her ever since. She said she considered waiting for him to draw and making sure he included his stepdad and stepsiblings. She even considered taking away all his art supplies. Over and over she told me that she wanted to get him to cut the shit and embrace the whole family in his art. I couldn't hold back from telling her she couldn't, and shouldn't, tell him what to draw. That his art is personal and he's being discreet when he gives some to his siblings. I also pointed out he has a lot of stuff he draws and she should focus on being proud of how good he is instead of turning his art into a battle. I reminded her that he's 17 and she won't win the battle, she'll simply push him away. This is when she cut me off and told me I had no right to interfere in her parenting and blended family and if I could not be supportive of her then I needed to shut my mouth. She ranted that I showed how little I give a fuck about the family and accused me of being a bitch.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696246408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xu8oq/aita_for_interfering_with_my_sisters_parenting/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well, many blended famillies. My parents divorced when i was 6 months old. I have a half sister from mom and her husband and an \"ex\" stepsister from dad.  \n\n I have very little relationship with my mother and 0 relarionship with her daughter and husband. With 2 of my stepmothers (i had 3) i talk even to this day. My stepsister is my soul sister. \n\n All this to say that you can't force sibling bonds. She is wrong for trying to force him to bond with these people. My mother tried to get us to bond with her husband and her daughter and now we want nothing to do with them, they're not part of our life. Your sister is heading into the same direction.", "NTA \n\nYour sister's going to find out the hard way that you're right. She's trying to force things then lashes out at him for not obeying her. And it seems to be her go to behavior. Look at how she acted when he didn't do what she wanted and compare it to how she acted with you.", "Ahhh. As the parent of a teen, I really feel for your sister. She's wrong, of course, but I feel for her. \n\nEverything you said is true. As a recommendation, I would also make it \"okay\" for your sister that your nephew expresses his grief that way, and it's not necessarily that he doesn't feel his \"new\" family isn't his \"real\" family. Although he may feel _exactly_ that way, and that, too, is completely ok. \n\nHer lashing out at you is her expressing her disappointment about his feelings. Feelings she CANNOT control. She likely thinks his feelings are somehow her fault (myriad options here; none relevant) and that she did something wrong because the family isn't bonded.\n\nYour sister needs to be encouraging behaviors of kindness, compassion, and understanding among all the siblings, not just your oldest nephew. \n\nThey feel what they feel. Period.\n\nNTA.", "NTA   you didnt interfere,  you gave your opinion when she came to you with a problem. \n\nAnd to make you even less the asshole your advice was good.", "This is such a sad situation. The kids, especially Ryder, lost their dad. That is so hard to cope with, and it feels like their mother refuses to allow them space to grieve. They can love and cherish their new family while still grieving their father. This is hard both from them and your sister. Yes, she\u2019s in the wrong, but I can sympathize with her. NTA and definitely keep beating on that drum. The kids need a safe space to mourn the loss of their father and the family that could have been. Hopefully your sister will see that before she alienates her kids.", "NTA, you are right, sis is on her way of alienating her bio kids, especially Ryder, and only has herself to blame.\n\nIt's so crappy of her to threaten with the taking away of supplies!", "NTA!\nRyder will end up going no contact pretty soon if she continues this behaviour with him.", "NTA \n\nBut your sister? Wow\n\nI would quietly take Ryder aside and tell him you understand his feelings and what his drawings mean to him and his sibs. That you support his decisions to draw what's in his heart, and that you don't agree with your sisters (quite horrible) view. And that you'll always be there for him.\n\nI have a feeling he's going to need you very soon. Thanks for being an empathetic Auntie", "NTA.\n\nYou would have been TA if this was totally unprompted advice. But this was in response to your sister unloading on you about this. You could have tried to say you wanted to change the subject, had to go, or made whatever excuse and not said anything. Depending on exactly how things went, context, tone, etc. that might have been easy or it could have been pretty challenging. You recognize that unsolicited advice is often problematic. But we are all human. Sometimes when someone is in the wrong (as your sister is here) and won\u2019t shut up about it, you just have to say something. It would be hard to just sit and listen to her justify screwing up her relationship with her son.", "NTA. Tell your nephew to bring all of his art supplies and special drawings to your house. And you keep them safe for him until he can move. When he is 18 he can come over whenever he wants to draw in peace. I am shocked at the amount of parents who thing they can tell someone what to do with a personal talent. I am confused as to why they feel they can dictate journals entries, art, photos, etc.", "\u201cI couldn\u2019t hold back\u201d \u2026. You voiced your opinion. Your sister told you she doesn\u2019t want to hear it. Why does it matter who is the ah in the situation? \n\nShe was venting to you about her child (she can do that) & didn\u2019t ask for your help or opinion. Maybe she will reflect on what you said & hopefully what you said will help guide her in dealing with this situation. However, her children are her responsibility & you don\u2019t get a vote on how she is raising them. Ryder is 17 & has the ability to speak for himself. That\u2019s the only person your sister needs to be listening to. \n\nYTA \u2014 next time all you need to say is \u201chow can I help? Would you like to hear my perspective of the situation?\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's selfish! Her son has every right to draw his dad however he wants. She will push him away by behaving that way. He might be gone, but his dad is still his dad. And she has no control over who he draws. Wow, take away his art supplies?! What an awful attitude.  He's 17, not a little kid. If anything, she will destroy any relationship they have.

Again, selfish!", "Yes, and OP please be there for and make sure Ryder knows that you love, support, and will be there for him.", "Being a yes man will only make the situation worse.

No one is privy to everything that goes on behind closed doors in another person\u2019s home. This is one scenario in this family\u2019s life. Who knows what is actually happening here. \n\nMy sisters & I have 8 kids between us. We step on each other\u2019s toes about parenting all the time. We also get told to shut the hell up. So we shut the hell up. Doesn\u2019t make my sister the ah if she\u2019s not ready/willing to hear another person\u2019s opinion.
