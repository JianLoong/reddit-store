If you do decide to trust him, and you get burned, that's still not your fault.  Others might call you naive, but you're making your choice with clear eyes. Communicate. Make a judgment call.

Did it in my city. He had hundreds with people he\u2019d met once. All those people had one, too, with a stranger. Hundreds! \n\nI\u2019m very picky about tattoos, and I would\u2019ve done it. Some things for some people, even those you don\u2019t know, can be special.", "This is the reply I was looking for. I have a few friends in my friend group that gets new matching tattoos every few months. They are of mixed genders and all have long-term partners who aren't involved in this. Sometimes it really is just about the ink. Especially considering it has meaning related to something they both enjoy.\n\nI think OP's feelings are valid, but I think she needs to have a much more direct conversation with her partner about what she feels like this tattoo will inadvertantly convey to other people, rather than take the advice of strangers that he *must* be cheating.", "yep. i have matching tattoos with my DOG. \ud83d\ude02", "Not mentioning it to the gf is a lil odd though", "Yep. A serious romantic relationship that fails and now you have a constant reminder inked onto your skin? That's painful.\n\nA casual friendship fizzled out and now you have a tattoo left from it? Mostly a funny story.\n\nBut the secrecy and the \"we would totally have fucked if he had the chance\" attitude here is not good.", "Me thinks in the future this is exactly what he will want. NTA", "And ffs, do not have sex with him - an accidental pregnancy would make the situation *so* much worse.", "Yeah.  I have been here for three days.  It stands out instantly.  Also what stands out is the intensity of reactions", "I think OP misunderstood your question...they are getting the tattoo because of the \"music artist\" they are traveling to see.  They are not traveling to find a better tattoo artist.", "Yeah. I love my little random tokens. They all remind me of exactly what I was doing at that time in my life. Professionally done, stick n poke or apartment inked, I love them all", "She gave very limited info, so how do you know ?", "I can\u2019t find she said that,  it is buried in the comments?", ">They all remind me of exactly what I was doing at that time in my life.\n\nOop. I am ashamed that I never once considered tattoos as being like a scrapbook or journal of sorts. \ud83d\ude33\n\nThank you for this new perspective!", "Up to you bb", "My best friend and I was supposed to get matching tattoos of a cartoon elephant holding a balloon! I got one by myself with her nickname in the balloon.", "Same colors? Or just same style? Need a pic of the balloon dog to match obvi", "Be right there", "She said he only has four tattoos since before and that three of them are small. I think that's enough info on that subject", "I have been here for three days.  I saw one yesterday where a guy heard OP's girlfriend  he heard on a radio show and wanted to meet her for a drink at a concert.  Her boyfriend did not want to prevent her going but quietly and sheepishly said he felt uncomfortable.\n\nHe was told he was jealous and insecure.  He made zero effort to stop her going.  He just said, \"hey, not super comfortable about this\"\n\nFor AITA, that made him an awful person, jealous, insecure, his feeling didnt matter, even if mild, politely expressed, and with zero effort to prevent her from going.", "that's super sweet!"]}
