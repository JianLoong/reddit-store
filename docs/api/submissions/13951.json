Because after that concert they\u2019ll be together together.", "It\u2019s not just the getting tattoos. \nIt\u2019s that he lied and didn\u2019t tell her. They said they\u2019re attracted to each other and would have sex under the right circumstances. They\u2019re going on an overnight trip without the girlfriend.  To see this band they both like and that the tattoo is related to. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take an idiot to see that if they aren\u2019t already hooking up, they will after that trip.", "Thank you! People in here are being so weird about tattoos xD", "But it's not about just friends getting matching tattoos and deciding who his friends are. Why didn't the boyfriend tell her he and the other girl were getting matching tattoos. He organised all of it. And then there is this \"both have said in separate situations that if things were different they would have/would sleep with each other or that they find the other person attractive.\"  All the things combined made OP uncomfortable and that's totally understandable. And I say this as someone who has/had partners with friends of the opposite gender and has friends of the opposite gender.", "I would \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37 I just like tattoos and decorating my body tho so that's just me. \nIn this case: definitely sounds like something is happening", "Ehh I know some people who would get matching tattoos with a hobo\n\nSome people love ink and will look for ANY excuse to get some", "The only reason I could think of here is that it's a tattoo related to the concert they're going to. Why it has to be matching tho? No clue.", "Seriously wtf would have prompted either of them to even say that? How disrespectful. \nNTA", "I'm pretty sure there is no post similar to this with just the genders reversed where the vote was YTA.  \n\n(I know, I just need to accept that \"but if the genders were reversed!\" is just one of this sub's memes along with \"I don't normally jump to saying get divorced like everyone else does in this sub, but get divorced\" etc.)", "Boo hoo they find eachother attractive(?) I've got lots of friends of the opposite sex I think are attractive, some of them I've even slept with, if I had a partner tell me I wasn't allowed to to get a tattoo or go on a trip with one of them I'd tell them to get absolutely fucked, op sounds paranoid and controlling imho.", "Aye that's me lol", "So true. I\u2019ll get matching tattoos with almost anyone lol.", "I see you have seen me.", ">if I had a partner tell me I wasn't allowed to to get a tattoo or go on a trip with one of them\n\nThat's not what she did, though.", "That's what I use it for too. Its a good word!!!!", "I mean, that's clearly what OP is getting at.", "Is it? She writes she doesn't want them  to get matching tattoos. And regarding all the other things she wrote, I can understand why she feels uncomfortable. But not wanting that doesn't mean that she tells him she won't allow it. And nowhere does it say she doesn't allow the trip, seems she knew about the trip and was okay with it, until she found out about tattoos."]}
