If you\u2019re concerned with you and him not having matching pieces, then suggest it yourself.

The former is a sign of platonic bonding, the latter is more often for possessive statements.)\n\nOh, and, THEIR bodies, THEIR choice.\n\nYTA\n\nEDIT: People are allowed to have emotional connections with friends!
