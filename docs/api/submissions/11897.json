We run a herd of about 45 cows and about two dozen goats. It has always been my dream to be a cattle rancher. We bought our ranch 7 years ago and little by little through blood sweat and tears I\u2019m finally feel like I\u2019ve come close to my dream.

I\u2019m trying to keep the peace with my wife so that\u2019s why i went along with it. The girlfriend is 25years old and doesn\u2019t work. She graduated college a couple years ago and has made zero attempt to find employment. She doesn\u2019t own a car or even have a license. This is problematic because we live 15 miles to the closest town(500 people) the closest big city is an hour away. He doesn\u2019t own a vehicle either, his jeep got repossessed last year. My wife said they can have my car since I have a truck too. (Not fan of this idea because he\u2019s totaled 3 of my cars since he turned 16) I drive an hour to work and would rather not drive my farm truck to work since it gets 11mpg. The final straw was when my stepson asked if I would be willing to sell off all my livestock since his girlfriend is vegan. He also said that we could eat meat but it could only be cooked outside since the smell of meat makes her ill. It was then that I told him that he should probably find other living arrangements or stay in the military until he is financially stable enough to live on his own. He still lives in the dorms as an E-5 because he has spent every dollar he has ever made(and then some judging by the weekly collection notices that get mailed to my house for some reason) My wife says I\u2019m being unreasonable and we should take care of our kids no matter what.

So to summarize, they want to:\n1.  Live with you for free, on your farm.\n2.  Make you sell your livestock because they want to sign up to live on a farm, for free, AND gain control over if/when the owner is allowed to have animals on their farm. \n3.  Banish you from your own kitchen and require you to cook all your meals outside.\n4.  Be gifted a free car.  Again.  After totaling other gifted cars.  3 times.  \n5.  Be gifted the (almost certainly astronomical) insurance for said free car because they likely don\u2019t have (or want to spend) money for that either, considering they just had a car repossessed.\n6.  Probably still require some chauffeuring, too, seeing as how one of them doesn\u2019t drive and has no plans to change that.\n7.  And most importantly, have zero realistic plan  (or incentive, based on their desired set-up) to EVER move out, as they already spend more than they make/don\u2019t save, have poor credit, and show no signs of wanting to change any of that.  \n\nLol, no.
