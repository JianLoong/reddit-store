They were high school sweethearts who had kids young, never married, and split when the kids were still little. They mostly always shared custody of the kids but for about 8 months in 2017 the kids were primarily with my brother because his ex was homeless. She got herself together again and she got married in 2020. Her husband has 3 or maybe 4 kids and ever since she remarried she has been asking my brother to include her stepkids in stuff he does with my niece and nephew. Like when he took them to Disney, or when he took them to the aquarium, etc. My brother has always told her no and has always ignored her attempts to get him more involved. The kids don't like their stepsiblings very much or their mom's husband, when they see him (it sounds like he is mostly absent) so they have never wanted them included in time with their dad. Lately she has decided since my brother isn't giving in, she'd focus on me and ask me to do these things with the kids. My husband, kids and myself often do things with my brother and the kids. She knows this. She asked me in person a couple of times if I'd mind bringing her stepkids along with us and watching out for them. I told her no. I told my brother. He told her to knock it off.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago my nephew came to me and said his mom wanted him and his sister to ask me to bring the stepkids along to a water park trip we have planned for May. He said they don't want them to come but his mom would be up his butt about it if he didn't ask. He said she wouldn't accept when they told her that I wouldn't say yes. I told him I would speak to his mom. So I called her up and she was starting off as though I had already said yes. I told her this was me calling to say no and to stop asking. She told me I should give it a shot and that the kids are missing out and how great it would be for my niece and nephew. She said she'd have them ready and would introduce us better before the weekend so the kids and I know each other. She said it would give the kids time doing stuff with their siblings. I told her that she needs to quit trying to pawn her stepkids off on my brother and me, because she has been told no each time and it is getting closer to harassment and it's unfair to drag the kids in the middle. She told me she is looking out for her stepkids and I'm a nasty bitch.\n\nMy brother is so tired of her but other than ignore her request, he can't do anything. He has tried but she does not want to listen.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682501918, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zc9gm/aita_for_telling_the_mom_of_my_niece_and_nephew/", "score": 782, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would turn it around next time you're on the phone: \"Oh goodness, I'm sorry you're having such a hard time... no, obviously you are because you can't seem to cope with your stepchildren. Are you and (new guy) in couple's counseling? You know what, let me ask around. I'm sure when I tell people you need help they'll be happy to recommend qualified professionals...\" etc in a sweet, concerned tone of voice.", "NTH. The visits are for your brother to see HIS kids and you to see your niece and nephew. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable including the step children then don\u2019t. Not your responsibility. These are children that have no relation to you or your brother, if there were to be a divorce you would never see them again more than likely.", "NTA!\n\nThese children have nothing to do with each other. They're not even half siblings! No means no, lady!", "Your brother's kids will soon be old enough that the courts will listen to them with regards to custody\n\nJust get all your ducks in a row and then help your brother get permanent custody\n\nDocument all this harassment and her constantly trying to pawn of childcare on to other people\n\nThat should help paint the correct picture for the judge\n\nNTA", "NTA keep her and her step kids at arms length", "NTA.\n\nNot your niblings, not your daycare.", "Nta if she wants her step kids to have fun then she and her husband need to be the ones planing trips with all their kids because they are the ones that are responsible for them. You and your brother have told her no many times that you don't wish to include her stepkids. She needs to step up and plan fun stuff with all her kids not you and your brother.", "NTA and your brother should seek full custody on the grounds of harassment.", "She was homeless before...so guess that influenced her decision", "That's correct. She has offered no money for us taking the kids along.", "Be prepared for the \"Ding-Dong-Ditch-My-Kids\" approach of leaving them on your doorstep and driving off. When that happens, let her know in no uncertain terms you will call the cops for child abandonment. A ring camera might be a good idea too. NTA.", "Yeah she\u2019s probably just exhausted by them. Still NTA though.", "INFO. Has your brother considered going directly to her husband about this issue? I'm sure he'd probably put a stop to his wife's behaviour if only to save his pride.", "Reduce communication to a single channel like email or text or voice calls. Set the rule that any request or mention of any topic outside of the two kids is out of bounds. Any communication mentioning anything else is deleted or the call ended and not responded to. Act as if those never happened. It will confuse and frustrate her but I bet she gives up. Plus, you will have less communication with her.\nAlso it might be worth discussing with an attorney that she is using the kids to try and get her way. That is generally frowned upon.", "The right way would be to do her own activities with her step kids. This isn't difficult.", "Odds are she accepted the step kids thinking it's just more of the same and that she could hand them over to your brother when she needed some mommy alone time.  Thing is, it's not really working out the way she'd hoped. Can your brother just take custody full time?", "I wonder if this is considered harassment and could be taken to court? Like she's literally harassing him over and over in the hopes that he will just give in.", "Just a thought but maybe respond that you will take all the kids but she must prepay for the step kids. Make an invoice that includes an hourly rate for each adult multiplied by the number of step kids. So 20$/hr, 4 step kids, 4 hours, is 320$. Add costs of gas, entry fees for activity, and the option that she pack their food or add additional money for food.\nThen it will be her who turns down your offer when it is 500+ $ .", "I already have security cameras outside my house and so does my brother. With kids in the house you can never be too careful.", "It could be any number of things. Part of me wonders if she wanted the security of being married after she was homeless for a time. But I can't say.", "$omething tell$ m\u00a3 that being homele$$ might have influenced her d\u00a3\u20aci$ion", "He hasn't because the husband isn't really around and does not seem to care much about what she does with his kids or what his kids do.", "Well that is sad. I understand that fear and husband probably saw a emotionally fragile woman.", "this was the funniest possible way to get your point across \ud83d\ude2d", "Actually didnt vote one way or the other. Don't think mom is helping, don't think OP is helping. Wasn't probably clear enough about that. \n\nI feel for the kids caught in the middle."]}
