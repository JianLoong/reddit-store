They were high school sweethearts who had kids young, never married, and split when the kids were still little. They mostly always shared custody of the kids but for about 8 months in 2017 the kids were primarily with my brother because his ex was homeless. She got herself together again and she got married in 2020. Her husband has 3 or maybe 4 kids and ever since she remarried she has been asking my brother to include her stepkids in stuff he does with my niece and nephew. Like when he took them to Disney, or when he took them to the aquarium, etc. My brother has always told her no and has always ignored her attempts to get him more involved. The kids don't like their stepsiblings very much or their mom's husband, when they see him (it sounds like he is mostly absent) so they have never wanted them included in time with their dad. Lately she has decided since my brother isn't giving in, she'd focus on me and ask me to do these things with the kids. My husband, kids and myself often do things with my brother and the kids. She knows this. She asked me in person a couple of times if I'd mind bringing her stepkids along with us and watching out for them. I told her no. I told my brother. He told her to knock it off.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago my nephew came to me and said his mom wanted him and his sister to ask me to bring the stepkids along to a water park trip we have planned for May. He said they don't want them to come but his mom would be up his butt about it if he didn't ask. He said she wouldn't accept when they told her that I wouldn't say yes. I told him I would speak to his mom. So I called her up and she was starting off as though I had already said yes. I told her this was me calling to say no and to stop asking. She told me I should give it a shot and that the kids are missing out and how great it would be for my niece and nephew. She said she'd have them ready and would introduce us better before the weekend so the kids and I know each other. She said it would give the kids time doing stuff with their siblings. I told her that she needs to quit trying to pawn her stepkids off on my brother and me, because she has been told no each time and it is getting closer to harassment and it's unfair to drag the kids in the middle. She told me she is looking out for her stepkids and I'm a nasty bitch.\n\nMy brother is so tired of her but other than ignore her request, he can't do anything. He has tried but she does not want to listen.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682501918, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zc9gm/aita_for_telling_the_mom_of_my_niece_and_nephew/", "score": 3038, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
