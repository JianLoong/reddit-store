Best wishes to you and baby", "There\u2019s a very low chance you\u2019ll be comfortable traveling 3 hours that late in pregnancy. Plus it\u2019s just so much nicer to have showers earlier so you have some time to unpack everything, buy anything you still need, etc. well before baby comes.\n\nI was miserable driving three hours to my in-laws for my shower at 28 weeks because sitting in a car triggered Braxton hicks for me. \n\nYou made your wishes clear in advance. You do not need to change your plans just because they ignored what you said would/wouldn\u2019t work.", "NTA and your husband seems like a terrible doctor since he doesn\u00b4t see a problem with you traveling so heavily pregnant.  which is concerning.  At that point of the pregnancy you should never be at a distance larger than a 30 minutes drive to a hospital.  If you start labor in the middle of the road, curing the 3 hours drive, which could happen,  you could be giving birh inside the car, which is dangerous bot for you and for the baby", "NTA - nip this type of behavior in the bud now.

IF you feel so inclined, have him set up a laptop or tablet and you can participate via Zoom.  That\u2019s a really big IF.  Personally, I\u2019d refuse to participate in any way because my child is not a commodity and it\u2019s important to set boundaries with overreaching family.\n\n(This is ridiculous on many levels.  First, if the shower is for you, it should be at a time and place convenient for you.  Second, your husband should know better regarding travel in the last month.  Haul him in to see your doctor. Third, showers aren\u2019t supposed to be given by family members anyway; they should be given by friends or co-workers.  His family is out of line and your husband is complicit.)", "The fact that they care so much about the baby and yet want to risk YOU putting in the travel time and potentially early labor is ridiculous. If they can't come to you then they aren't that excited. Traveling isn't recommended that late in the game. \n\nYou warned them ahead of time to plan it earlier as you do not want to travel like that. They chose to ignore you. Now they can choose to travel or they can choose to miss out.", "Why can't they make the trip to you? Obvs you're very prego.", "Honestly this should have been the plan all along.

She said don't bother, losing weight won't help.  I am losing anyway because I want to feel better about myself, and at my age it isn't easy, especially since exercise is difficult for me.  She was trying to spare my feelings just in case I'm unsuccessful.  I love that woman!", "NTA. Traveling in the final month is a game of chance. I was 45 minutes away from the hospital (at a garage sale, 39 weeks) when my water broke.  So I made it to the hospital in time. But 3 hours away is too far. Stand your ground.

Traveling while heavily pregnant is hell. I had to go to a specialist 2hrs away at 32w and then 39w pregnant. I was so uncomfortable. At the last appointment I wanted to go eat closer to home after.

Just say yes and have intent to go, but then on the day of, oh lord jeezus you have terrible diarrhea and can\u2019t go! \n\nPeople seem to forget it\u2019s easier to get forgiven than to get permission. This is a perfect scenario for this saying. \n\nI know you want to stand your ground and make a point maybe because it is very inconsiderate to plan it all so close to the end and 3 hrs away. But it will be easier just to \u201cgo along with it\u201d and then cancel due to something they can\u2019t be mad about. You\u2019ll have more energy to deal with their bullshit from home or after the baby has come.", "Even better, let them have a shower, and you zoom in.\n\nWe had to do our shower via zoom due to COVID, but my MIL was insistent that it be in person. It gets even better, because we all live in different states, so my MIL said \u2018well you guys can come here, and your family can decide if they want to come.\u2019 My mother, who was hosting, was like hell no. So we zoomed, while my MIL invited that side of the family and all their friends to a restaurant they rented, and barely paid attention to the games my mother and SIL had set up. \n\nIs was the best shower it could be, for the situation, and my MIL caused more drama than needed.", "You could have a baby party after the baby is born?

No one will judge them at all for having a baby shower with no mom /s", "When I was pregnant with my first, it was a high risk pregnancy (my mom had to move in to take care of me). My dad lived in Louisiana and I lived in North Dakota at the time. My dad's work friends wanted to throw a shower, even if I couldn't attend, so they did one with my dad as my stand-in, took videos of the party, and sent the gifts my way.    \nThis is all to say that you are not obligated to travel to accommodate THEIR wishes.", "NTA their excitement doesn't take priority over your comfort & safety.
