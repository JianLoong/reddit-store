You are a TEAM, now, and something like this often takes a team effort.\n\nEDIT: When I had my first baby, we had Lamaze classes, a breastfeeding class, tour of the \nlabor/delivery room, finalizing the nursery preparations, packing the bag for the hospital, all kinds of stuff to do in the last month before the birth.
