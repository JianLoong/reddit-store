I am 36m and she is 34f.  \n\nThe honest core of this question is that I am super anti-\"notification\". I know I sound like a boomer but I got sick of knowing that Aunt Maple commented on my Insta post *years ago*. I will open the app if I want to know that. I do not need to know about Aunt Maple's comment until the second I seek out that information.\n\nHowever, I appreciated the health and activity features on the Apple Watch. So I got one for myself and I tediously curated the information delivered to me on my wrist. Notifications are even worse on the watch because I can't exactly just flip the watch over and ignore it!\n\nMy wife (whom I love very much) wanted to make sure she could get a hold of me, so we use a chat app that allows notifications. The rules were **very clear** when I switched to this app: she can text me *once* and I'll answer at my earliest convenience. I will always know it is her texting because she is the only person who has access to my wrist notifications. Any more than one text means \"emergency\".\n\nShe has run afoul of that rule many times, as you can guess. She says she very literally cannot stop herself when she gets excited and that she's not neurotypical like me so I can't understand. And she's right, I don't understand what it's like to have ADHD, but I do know what my boundaries are with my wrist buzzing while I'm at work. \n\nLast week, she sent me like four consecutive texts because she found out that her coworker (who I don't know and frankly do not care about) had gotten a DUI. While he was *in college, years ago*. So that night I sat down with her and said I was not going to do the wrist notifications anymore, and that I'd regularly check my phone for messages from her.\n\nShe was kind of vaguely mad about it for a week, but yesterday I finally just confronted her about it and she said that she thought I was being disrespectful of her limitations and that everyone gets used to notifications eventually. I said it had been three months and I was still not used to it, and she said I should give it more time. \n\nHere's where I might've been an asshole: I told her I thought this was a tiny issue that wasn't even worth being angry about. I still check my phone for her texts and I've never missed one by more than like fifteen minutes. I also explained that she can still call me if there's an emergency. She's still mad.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679075028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ty5n3/aita_for_removing_my_wifes_wrist_privileges/", "score": 412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It comes across like you care more about your \u201cboundaries\u201d and never being interrupted than you do about your wife, which may be why she\u2019s upset. \n\nMost of us with ADHD - especially women, at least the ones I know - have been called annoying or too much our entire lives, and it hurts to have someone who is supposed to love you also tell you you\u2019re too much. \n\nI have ADHD and early on in our relationship my now-husband and I had to have a conversation about my texting while he was at work because his boss was giving him a hard time about it. It was hard - still is sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t matter as much now because his current job doesn\u2019t care if he uses his phone - because if I wait, I\u2019ll 100% forget what I was going to tell him by the end of the time he\u2019s off. Also, sometimes I would forget he was at work, since he didn\u2019t work traditional hours and we worked different shifts. \n\nI understood why he had to do it, and I respected it, but I was definitely hurt in a way that I suspect your wife is too (maybe even worse for her, since the bad guy in my scenario was the boss rather than my husband himself *and* we weren\u2019t married). \n\nI think turning text notifications off on your watch is reasonable, since you still have your phone and most texts don\u2019t actually require an immediate answer. That buzzing does get annoying after a while. Your \u201crule\u201d about never texting more than once, however, is unreasonable in general and totally unworkable when you\u2019re married to someone with ADHD.

We tend to have this much worse than people without adhd. Task switching is very hard..\n\nOP just rejected his wife for wanting to talk to him.

What we do is have two different chat apps. One is actual text messages and the second is FB messenger (but there are lots of better options, we just already had it installed).  \n\nAnyway, we use messenger for random inconsequential stuff and he checks them if he has time at work (but usually after work). Many people can't be on their phone answering texts all day at work. More than half of what I send isn't important, just things I don't want to forget to tell him. Sometimes we use it as a list when he gets home. We'll scroll through what I sent and talk about them so that way he doesn't have to answer me back by typing at all. \n\nFor really important stuff or things that are time sensitive I use actual text. He has his watch to get those notifications only. I don't ever abuse it to chat. It's just things like 'Get milk on your way home', 'I'm working late', 'Dog had to go to the vet', etc. Helps keep both of us sane. You're absolutely allowed to have boundaries but in a relationship it's good to compromise and find a way to meet everyone's needs.

My point it I have like fishbowl brain if something or someone isn\u2019t in my immediate vicinity or on my mind I will forget they exist completely. As well as having memory issues like I can\u2019t remember what I said to my sister two night ago I can give you a vague description of what we were talking about but specifics is a no so it could also just be she is repeatedly forgetting and then beating herself up for it. Also impulsiveness is very much part of adhd and sometimes its true can\u2019t stop it I\u2019ve done similar with ordering food and then I immediately afterwards go what did I just do. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that because she has these issues that you just need to deal with it because her stepping over your boundaries is not ok either. I\u2019m just saying don\u2019t hold it against her or make her feel worse than she already does because most women with adhd also have rsd and that is rejection sensitivity dysphoria which just means we are very sensitive to criticism and also beat ourselves up over the simplest mistakes. \n\nNow obviously this is all just me explaining from my own personal experiences so I could be wrong so please take this with that in mind as I dont know her or you. Just as a like disclaimer. Anyway I think my point is I don\u2019t think anyone is an ass in this. Nah. Because from this comment it shows she seems to want to try and not overstep the boundaries and gets upset with herself over it and is internally frustrated and angry with herself but on the outside is maybe placing blame on you in a way for whatever reasons? I\u2019m not entirely sure on that part cause what she said about notifications getting used to them or something .  I get that in some ways I have notifications off on most things because I hate it but on some I have them on but end up forgetting or ignoring them. Anyway the way she said that makes me think that In a way maybe she is also trying to make it not her fault but I\u2019m not sure.\n\n\nI honestly just suggest sitting down and talking to her and asking her about it and also asking if what you are saying is making sense because personally I always ask that because I know not just speaking about neurodivergent and neurotypical brains but everyone thinks and processes things differently so the way I\u2019m explaining soemthing might not compute in your brain so I would ask does this make sense or does that make sense and if you said no I would then try to explain it in a different way or in different terms that you would understand. That is soemthing I think alot of people don\u2019t realize and instead of explaining it agin they just say people are stupid and that\u2019s not the case just a communication issue. \n\n\nAnyway I wish you and your wife nothing but happiness. Also maybe a psychiatrist who specializes in adhd could be something to look into as they can help not only her with how to cope and act and react to things but also maybe it could be a bridge to help you understand her illness better. \n\nA book I recommend is called dirty laundry from this couple who the wife has adhd and the husband doesn\u2019t and it explains things deeper than just the vague symptoms they give at the doctors like impulsive forgetful and all the others.", "Yeah... Impulse control is super hard for us, ADHD brains... \n\nWe have a similar problem with my partner... \n\nHe is a BIG EA fifa player and when he is in a match I CAN'T come in his office cause it's distracting and he ends up playing poorly and it pisses him off...

I keep everything on silent and the damn phone is still a distraction. Your wife\u2019s expectations about your responsiveness to texting sound ridiculous.

I can't do the random phone calls while someone drives somewhere, I can't do the random text expecting replies saying \"look what I'm doing\" etc. It drags me out of work and I get nothing done. During the day I keep my phone on silent and half the time use the iPhone focus modes to block all notifications besides phone calls from my kid's ECE. I reply when I can, but I've had people treat their random photos of what they're doing at work or what's for lunch as absolutely time sensitive and critical and get upset with me in further messages for not replying, and those people get the privilege of me turning off their individual notifications so I can get some work done.", "For me, it depends on what I'm doing.
