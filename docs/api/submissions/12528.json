I am 36m and she is 34f.  \n\nThe honest core of this question is that I am super anti-\"notification\". I know I sound like a boomer but I got sick of knowing that Aunt Maple commented on my Insta post *years ago*. I will open the app if I want to know that. I do not need to know about Aunt Maple's comment until the second I seek out that information.\n\nHowever, I appreciated the health and activity features on the Apple Watch. So I got one for myself and I tediously curated the information delivered to me on my wrist. Notifications are even worse on the watch because I can't exactly just flip the watch over and ignore it!\n\nMy wife (whom I love very much) wanted to make sure she could get a hold of me, so we use a chat app that allows notifications. The rules were **very clear** when I switched to this app: she can text me *once* and I'll answer at my earliest convenience. I will always know it is her texting because she is the only person who has access to my wrist notifications. Any more than one text means \"emergency\".\n\nShe has run afoul of that rule many times, as you can guess. She says she very literally cannot stop herself when she gets excited and that she's not neurotypical like me so I can't understand. And she's right, I don't understand what it's like to have ADHD, but I do know what my boundaries are with my wrist buzzing while I'm at work. \n\nLast week, she sent me like four consecutive texts because she found out that her coworker (who I don't know and frankly do not care about) had gotten a DUI. While he was *in college, years ago*. So that night I sat down with her and said I was not going to do the wrist notifications anymore, and that I'd regularly check my phone for messages from her.\n\nShe was kind of vaguely mad about it for a week, but yesterday I finally just confronted her about it and she said that she thought I was being disrespectful of her limitations and that everyone gets used to notifications eventually. I said it had been three months and I was still not used to it, and she said I should give it more time. \n\nHere's where I might've been an asshole: I told her I thought this was a tiny issue that wasn't even worth being angry about. I still check my phone for her texts and I've never missed one by more than like fifteen minutes. I also explained that she can still call me if there's an emergency. She's still mad.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679075028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ty5n3/aita_for_removing_my_wifes_wrist_privileges/", "score": 1205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It comes across like you care more about your \u201cboundaries\u201d and never being interrupted than you do about your wife, which may be why she\u2019s upset. \n\nMost of us with ADHD - especially women, at least the ones I know - have been called annoying or too much our entire lives, and it hurts to have someone who is supposed to love you also tell you you\u2019re too much. \n\nI have ADHD and early on in our relationship my now-husband and I had to have a conversation about my texting while he was at work because his boss was giving him a hard time about it. It was hard - still is sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t matter as much now because his current job doesn\u2019t care if he uses his phone - because if I wait, I\u2019ll 100% forget what I was going to tell him by the end of the time he\u2019s off. Also, sometimes I would forget he was at work, since he didn\u2019t work traditional hours and we worked different shifts. \n\nI understood why he had to do it, and I respected it, but I was definitely hurt in a way that I suspect your wife is too (maybe even worse for her, since the bad guy in my scenario was the boss rather than my husband himself *and* we weren\u2019t married). \n\nI think turning text notifications off on your watch is reasonable, since you still have your phone and most texts don\u2019t actually require an immediate answer. That buzzing does get annoying after a while. Your \u201crule\u201d about never texting more than once, however, is unreasonable in general and totally unworkable when you\u2019re married to someone with ADHD.

We tend to have this much worse than people without adhd. Task switching is very hard..\n\nOP just rejected his wife for wanting to talk to him.

One is actual text messages and the second is FB messenger (but there are lots of better options, we just already had it installed).  \n\nAnyway, we use messenger for random inconsequential stuff and he checks them if he has time at work (but usually after work). Many people can't be on their phone answering texts all day at work. More than half of what I send isn't important, just things I don't want to forget to tell him. Sometimes we use it as a list when he gets home. We'll scroll through what I sent and talk about them so that way he doesn't have to answer me back by typing at all. \n\nFor really important stuff or things that are time sensitive I use actual text. He has his watch to get those notifications only. I don't ever abuse it to chat. It's just things like 'Get milk on your way home', 'I'm working late', 'Dog had to go to the vet', etc. Helps keep both of us sane.

My point it I have like fishbowl brain if something or someone isn\u2019t in my immediate vicinity or on my mind I will forget they exist completely. As well as having memory issues like I can\u2019t remember what I said to my sister two night ago I can give you a vague description of what we were talking about but specifics is a no so it could also just be she is repeatedly forgetting and then beating herself up for it. Also impulsiveness is very much part of adhd and sometimes its true can\u2019t stop it I\u2019ve done similar with ordering food and then I immediately afterwards go what did I just do. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that because she has these issues that you just need to deal with it because her stepping over your boundaries is not ok either. I\u2019m just saying don\u2019t hold it against her or make her feel worse than she already does because most women with adhd also have rsd and that is rejection sensitivity dysphoria which just means we are very sensitive to criticism and also beat ourselves up over the simplest mistakes. \n\nNow obviously this is all just me explaining from my own personal experiences so I could be wrong so please take this with that in mind as I dont know her or you. Just as a like disclaimer. Anyway I think my point is I don\u2019t think anyone is an ass in this. Nah. Because from this comment it shows she seems to want to try and not overstep the boundaries and gets upset with herself over it and is internally frustrated and angry with herself but on the outside is maybe placing blame on you in a way for whatever reasons? I\u2019m not entirely sure on that part cause what she said about notifications getting used to them or something .  I get that in some ways I have notifications off on most things because I hate it but on some I have them on but end up forgetting or ignoring them. Anyway the way she said that makes me think that In a way maybe she is also trying to make it not her fault but I\u2019m not sure.\n\n\nI honestly just suggest sitting down and talking to her and asking her about it and also asking if what you are saying is making sense because personally I always ask that because I know not just speaking about neurodivergent and neurotypical brains but everyone thinks and processes things differently so the way I\u2019m explaining soemthing might not compute in your brain so I would ask does this make sense or does that make sense and if you said no I would then try to explain it in a different way or in different terms that you would understand. That is soemthing I think alot of people don\u2019t realize and instead of explaining it agin they just say people are stupid and that\u2019s not the case just a communication issue. \n\n\nAnyway I wish you and your wife nothing but happiness. Also maybe a psychiatrist who specializes in adhd could be something to look into as they can help not only her with how to cope and act and react to things but also maybe it could be a bridge to help you understand her illness better. \n\nA book I recommend is called dirty laundry from this couple who the wife has adhd and the husband doesn\u2019t and it explains things deeper than just the vague symptoms they give at the doctors like impulsive forgetful and all the others.", "Yeah...

During the day I keep my phone on silent and half the time use the iPhone focus modes to block all notifications besides phone calls from my kid's ECE. I reply when I can, but I've had people treat their random photos of what they're doing at work or what's for lunch as absolutely time sensitive and critical and get upset with me in further messages for not replying, and those people get the privilege of me turning off their individual notifications so I can get some work done.", "For me, it depends on what I'm doing.

Maybe I'm missing something but that just sounds so crappy to me. \"hey, I love you, but I really cannot handle anymore than a single notification from you so you need to shut up or I'm literally going to mute you so you can't talk to me until *I say so*.\" I get that he has an issue with notifications, but this could be handled better. He should have everything but call notifications disabled from the beginning so she can do what she likes. Giving her the ability to send notifications and then telling her she's too annoying you can't stand it anymore is really icky.\nAnd getting annoyed about hearing from your partner is weird to me in general. If she was texting him over and over and over again all the time that's one thing but OP's example is *4* messages *back to back*. That is not a lot. If there's a little bit of space between them, that's maybe 2-3 minutes of interruption as she types and sends them?? If they were every 5-10-15 minutes I'd understand a little more because interruption, find your groove again and start working, interruption, repeat is more difficult than a couple minutes at once. \nMaybe I'm biased, idk. Most of these comments basically telling her to stop having ADHD and it's his way or the highway is icky to me.", "I DON'T have ADHD and constant phone buzzing gets into my body somehow and causes terrible physical anxiety.", "Fucking thank you. I absolutely hate constant notifications and weird demands for meaningless responses. The more notifications I receive the more stressed out I become and it has a serious impact on my mental health. It seems like such a stupid thing, but it becomes a list of demands when I already can't prioritize which demands are actually important. I have some friends who luckily operate the same way so if I don't respond to a text for a month it's no big deal, and vice versa. If it's urgent, I'll follow up. If I haven't, it's not. Our texts are multiple huge paragraphs all in one so it's one notification. I hate the constant pull of my attention in 100 different directions. People do not understand how much harder the world is for neurodivergent people than it used to be. Technology is great, but I would be more likely to check my 35 voicemails if I didn't also have hundreds of emails, random texts, random app notifications, and have many of those things at work too.", "Autistic/ADHD people are people. There are no traits that we have that don\u2019t exist in the neurotypical population. You could say this about *any* group of people and their experiences. It\u2019s more of the combination and degree of things that makes the difference. \n\nFor example, most people fidget at least some of the time. But people with ADHD and autistic people fidget more on average. If an ND person posts about fidgeting, there\u2019s no need to respond by saying that other people fidget too.\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing (a person saying they have never heard of an NT person doing the thing) is obviously an extreme but I see these comments any time ND people comment about any aspect of their experience.", "Good point. Better stated - *control* of task switching is hard.

He already says he checks when he has moments and always tries to respond withing 15 minutes, he just hates the vibration/noise spam.  I dont understand why his annoyance at the multiple buzzes in a row is somehow less valid than her need for him to keep them on.\n\nEDIT:  Also the whole issue is that his wife gets offended when he says hes going to turn on DND during work, thats why he made the compromise of the one message thing", "like... daily. sometimes many times per day.", "But OP did make a big deal out of it. He \"sat down with her\" and officially notified her that he was turning off the wrist notifications because of her.

It's asinine.", "Sure - but tell me where in OP's post did he state that his wife nagged him to chat all day? \n\nNo where. All she did was send him four texts about a topic she was excited to share with him. He's the one that made it into a deal. \n\nMy husband works a job where there are times he can't chat.

I always forget and so that\u2019s part of an issue I deal with because I tend to interrupt people without realizing it.

The one thing you don't do is deliberately do something your partner doesn't like and expect it to be okay. You don't get a pass to be annoying over a ring. Sorry not sorry.\n\nI am ADHD as fuck and I text people like his wife does. But then sometimes people ask me to stop, because they do not like their phone being blown up over trivial things while they're at work or doing their thing or wjatever. So I stop doing that. I combine things into one message. Because I am fully aware that some people find it annoying, especially if its over gossip. People are allowed to not like receiving mass texts from one person over an event they are unrelated to.\n\nI will also tell you that despite me being someone that does that, I hate having it done back to me. So I make sure the other person understands that because I have ADHD, I commonly send texts very broken up and erratic fashion.  And if they don't like it? I fix that. Because annoying ADHD behaviors are exactly that: annoying. I cannot tell you how many times in school alone I was tapping my feet on the floor or chewing on a pencil or tapping on my desk and got bitched at for it. But now as a 25 year old, I understand that was very annoying to other people. I shouldn't expect everyone else to deal with me playing the bass drums to Metallica's \"One\" during a test because i have ADHD. It's up to ME to manage MY mental health problem, not them. Why would I hold them accountable to deal with an annoying behavior of mine? The least I can do being a respectful person is to not do the thing they asked me not to do. You don't use a mental illness as a crutch to excuse bad behavior. \n\nWhy is it his fault she can't she can't respect a simple request of: \"hey. I dont like my phone being blown up, so im gonna make this to where only you give me notifications while I'm at work. so please don't blow my phone up unless its an emergency.\"? I seriously think people are taking this entirely too deep. \n\nAlso this may be nitpicky but \"at my earliest convenience\" doesn't mean he'll check when he feels like it. That means that when he's distracted a while, lets say working, he may not be paying attention to his phone so he'll get back to her when he gets a second. That's just another way to say I'll get to you when I can. Thats not making her unimportant, thats just being an adult.", "It\u2019s only one notification, otherwise she can text whenever she wants he will just put it on silent and won\u2019t see it until he looks", "we actually just use google chat. we are a cross-platform family so it just works. the notifications are really easy to manage too", "But she has ADHD!!!/s", "You're right ADHD isn't cookie cutter and impulsivity is a huge part of it. HOWEVER, as someone with ADHD myself who has to function in society with other people I have adapted and temper my impulsivity. My career demands that I wait patiently for a pause in conversations before talking and I'd say I'm about 90% successful at waiting. \n\nI also know that Passive Demand Avoidance is a HUGE issue for us. Myself and most ADHD people I know have notifications completely off except for a select few people because being buzzed a million times or even seeing the bubble that dozens of texts or emails have come in can be so overwhelming we can't respond to anyone. \n\nOP hold your boundary, yes ADHD makes lots of things harder but I wouldn't trample over my partners boundaries without there being an actual emergency, especially at work. \n\nI grew up way before cellphones and still don't like being expected to be reachable at any moment. Luckily my partner is of a similar mindset so neither of us mind if hours pass before a non-emergency response.", "Exactly, this is how my husband (with ADHD) texts.

You don\u2019t like notifications and that\u2019s fine, but you don\u2019t have to treat your wife like a child or speak to her like one because you gave a her a one sided rule, and she didn\u2019t behave in a way you found favorable. \n\nI think the vibe I\u2019m getting is from the part about not following the rules. Generally, rules are given by an authority figure or group to someone in their care or charge, and there is a penalty or reward for breaking/following them. They usually maintain necessary order and safety in society or groups. \n\nDo you feel you have authority over your grown wife in a way where you can give her rules vs making loving requests that don\u2019t make her feel like there\u2019s something wrong with her? Reminder, your requests comes from your personal taste, and taste is not a mandate or universal. The rule part makes things feel more like a relationship of parent to child, or government to citizen. AKA not an agreement between equal partners or two independent adults. \n\nI think people often associate the impulsiveness or distraction of ADHD with being immature/childish, or someone not trying hard enough\u2014in other words behaviors that need correcting or uprooting with very little leeway, understanding or patience. \n\nFor people with ADHD, certain behaviors are not a matter of us not trying hard enough. We can work on them, but might always struggle due to our brains being constructed differently. \n\nWould you be mad at someone who\u2019s legs developed atypically because they never learned to walk exactly like someone who\u2019s legs had developed typically?

If it\u2019s an emergency I call. Maybe check in with her and see what she\u2019s really thinking about you turning off the notifications and reassure her there\u2019s no rejection behind it.

Even if she's not being particularly selective, it seems somewhat toxic to mislead her into using two different apps by giving her the deliberate false impression that one of those will be checked more often than the other when both will just sit there until he's checking his phone.\n\nThe whole point is that the watch is only for high level notifications and low level things can wait until he's checking his phone.
