I am 36m and she is 34f.  \n\nThe honest core of this question is that I am super anti-\"notification\". I know I sound like a boomer but I got sick of knowing that Aunt Maple commented on my Insta post *years ago*. I will open the app if I want to know that. I do not need to know about Aunt Maple's comment until the second I seek out that information.\n\nHowever, I appreciated the health and activity features on the Apple Watch. So I got one for myself and I tediously curated the information delivered to me on my wrist. Notifications are even worse on the watch because I can't exactly just flip the watch over and ignore it!\n\nMy wife (whom I love very much) wanted to make sure she could get a hold of me, so we use a chat app that allows notifications. The rules were **very clear** when I switched to this app: she can text me *once* and I'll answer at my earliest convenience. I will always know it is her texting because she is the only person who has access to my wrist notifications. Any more than one text means \"emergency\".\n\nShe has run afoul of that rule many times, as you can guess. She says she very literally cannot stop herself when she gets excited and that she's not neurotypical like me so I can't understand. And she's right, I don't understand what it's like to have ADHD, but I do know what my boundaries are with my wrist buzzing while I'm at work. \n\nLast week, she sent me like four consecutive texts because she found out that her coworker (who I don't know and frankly do not care about) had gotten a DUI. While he was *in college, years ago*. So that night I sat down with her and said I was not going to do the wrist notifications anymore, and that I'd regularly check my phone for messages from her.\n\nShe was kind of vaguely mad about it for a week, but yesterday I finally just confronted her about it and she said that she thought I was being disrespectful of her limitations and that everyone gets used to notifications eventually. I said it had been three months and I was still not used to it, and she said I should give it more time. \n\nHere's where I might've been an asshole: I told her I thought this was a tiny issue that wasn't even worth being angry about. I still check my phone for her texts and I've never missed one by more than like fifteen minutes. I also explained that she can still call me if there's an emergency. She's still mad.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679075028, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ty5n3/aita_for_removing_my_wifes_wrist_privileges/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you cannot adapt to getting multiple notifications from her, that's also fine. I think your solution of checking occasionally and still letting calls come through in an emergency makes sense. Maybe there's other solutions that would work - but this sounds like the issue between you two is based in emotion, not the notification system itself?\n\nI would consider talking about the emotional headspaces y'all are in.

Maybe I'm biased because I also hate constant notifications, but it's perfectly reasonable not to want to be interrupted by trivial stuff all the time. The fact that your wife has ADHD may mean that she has trouble regulating herself, but in response to that, it is perfectly fine to regulate your own reactions by turning off notifications from her.

It seems as though you need to check your phone more often if you don't want to have your watch give notifications.", "I'm going to say that the real problem here is the technology. \n\nJust say that texting at all is an emergency, and that if she wants to communicate about non-emergencies, then have her send an email, so your watch still notifies you of emails from her but it'll only notify once.\n\nWith traditional text messaging, there is a size limit so if she writes a long message it will automatically send the full message in multiple chunks which might trigger multiple notifications.\n\nYou're also expecting a non-neurotypical person to behave neurotypically when it comes to regulating themselves, and that only adds to the problem. \n\nI believe there is even an app out there which is simply an emergency button so there's no content or anything, so she could press it in case of a true emergency (and there's no way to send content so it removes that inclination to keep writing) and it would be faster than texting or calling, and she can use emails for non-emergencies.\n\nNAH - just figure out a better solution", "YTA if the buzzing bugs you turn it off but having adhd I send friends and my partner spam messages sometimes when my emotions are high. IF she expected a response immediately then she's be TAH because you're at work but you didnt say that. Idk man I don't think you're ready to have such accessible communication if you can't ignore it or learn to turn off the notifications.", "NAH, but you do seem a little obsessed with not getting notifications. It comes across like you care more about your \u201cboundaries\u201d and never being interrupted than you do about your wife, which may be why she\u2019s upset. \n\nMost of us with ADHD - especially women, at least the ones I know - have been called annoying or too much our entire lives, and it hurts to have someone who is supposed to love you also tell you you\u2019re too much. \n\nI have ADHD and early on in our relationship my now-husband and I had to have a conversation about my texting while he was at work because his boss was giving him a hard time about it. It was hard - still is sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t matter as much now because his current job doesn\u2019t care if he uses his phone - because if I wait, I\u2019ll 100% forget what I was going to tell him by the end of the time he\u2019s off. Also, sometimes I would forget he was at work, since he didn\u2019t work traditional hours and we worked different shifts. \n\nI understood why he had to do it, and I respected it, but I was definitely hurt in a way that I suspect your wife is too (maybe even worse for her, since the bad guy in my scenario was the boss rather than my husband himself *and* we weren\u2019t married). \n\nI think turning text notifications off on your watch is reasonable, since you still have your phone and most texts don\u2019t actually require an immediate answer. That buzzing does get annoying after a while. Your \u201crule\u201d about never texting more than once, however, is unreasonable in general and totally unworkable when you\u2019re married to someone with ADHD.
