Don't you just love it when people are offended on your behalf? \ud83d\ude44 \n\nIt's your relationship, you want to have some healthy time apart before you get thrown into the chaos that a new baby can bring. That's completely normal and you have a plan in case you go into labor early.", "NTA you've discussed the situation with your partner and come to a decision. You understand and accept the risks of that decision.\n\nRemember,  opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one.", "NTA the only opinions that matter are yours and your husband's.  He'll only be two hours away and if he makes sure to be reachable at all times, it's not that big a deal.", "NTA. This is so healthy! I can understand them being concerned, but you two sound like you know what you're doing. It's not your first pregnancy. You have allthethings covered. You are happy to support your husband in this mutually-planned important thing. And, taking time off to rest and just be alone (during the day) prior to the birth of your second child sounds fantastic. \n\nThey should definitely drop this.", "NTA  they don\u2019t get tell you what to do ..he gets to go you have a plan in place what more do they want?? Did they interfere the first time ?", "NTA. - It sounds like you guys have thought of all the contingencies and the risk doesn\u2019t seem to be to great, so long as your 100% on board with this. If rather, you felt bad because both your lives are about to change again and you wanted him to have a little bit of freedom before the added responsibility and he was willing to jump on that\u2026 well then both of you might want to check your motivations. I say that as a father who would have been much too nervous to go off with the boys for 1 or 2 days, let alone 5\u2026 and two hours isn\u2019t all that close. This is just me, but yea I can understand why others are raising eyebrows about it. All that being said, it is your and his life, you guys do you. I wish you the best of luck with the upcoming baby addition!", "NTA\n\nIf you're fine with it, what reason do they have to not be?\n\nTell them it's not up to them to decide. Case closed.", "NTA. You and your husband both agreed to him going on the trip. You are perfectly fine with it. Your family needs to stay out of what is a decision that you two have already agreed on.", "NTA at all! \n\n You're both adults and it's clear this wasn't just him deciding to ditch you for some time off with friends.\nIf you both feel comfortable with the situation, that's all that matters. \n\nIn my opinion it is healthy to spend time with friends separately. You're more than just mom & dad or a married couple. \n\nEnjoy your week off with your daughter! Maybe have a nice girls night with a friend while you're at it!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're happy, your husband is happy why are these people all up in your business?", "Easy NTA. You and your spouse sound like two responsible adults who mutually agreed on him going on this trip. Your family definitely should stay out of that.", "NTA. As long as you are fine with it.\n\nYour husband is NTA if he\u2019s only two hours away and on standby at all hours, and if you have people who can take you to the hospital immediately. Even so, I would not be going on the trip if I were him.", "NTA. Everyone else needs to mind their business they're not the ones having to go through it and it sounds like you guys have planned everything out in case something does happen.", "NTA. I don\u2019t see the problem \u2014 you're both happy, and that's what matters \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "You're NTA. People should mind their own business.", "NTA \n\nYou are comfortable with him going on the trip and it's only 2 hours away.", "NTA.  \u201cIf you can\u2019t mind your own business and stop telling me what I should want done we are done talking\u201d click.   Then don\u2019t answer again and everyone goes on an info diet.", "NTA\nYou've taken care of and discussed all the contingency plans with the only person who matters, your husband. They need to mind their own business.", "Yup definitely NTA op can make their own decisions", "I too was thinking the quiet time in advance of the upcoming controlled chaos sounded like such a gift <3", "NTA. \n\nPeople seem to have this thing that parents need to always be together and present for everything just in case. It\u2019s obvious none of these judgmental people have ever spend time as a military spouse. Or as a firefighters spouse. Or a doctors spouse. \n\nIf you\u2019re okay with it, stop telling others what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re giving other people too much information about your life.", "NTA. Your family your choices. sounds like you have a loving and understanding partnership which is very healthy. If you and your husband don\u2019t have issues with him getting away then others need to keep their mouths shut. You have a contingency plan and he\u2019s only a couple of hours away if needed. I think others are just jealous!", "If you don\u2019t care then their opinions don\u2019t matter. NTA", "NTA- You have your bases covered so what\u2019s the issue? Not only are you okay with it you communicated and figured out a plan in case you give birth early.", "Nta. All that matters is you and him are on the same page. You both logically know something could happen and he could miss the birth.  But both of you are comfortable with this trip that's the only thing that matters", "NAH. Their concerns are reasonable, but it sounds like you have it all worked out.", "NTA .! And you are an amazing wife, for giving that time to your husband and taking some time for yourself and understanding that partners need time apart and that\u2019s OK and your family has no right to butt in your relationship. You do what works for you.", "Yeah, absolutely NTA - and you\u2019re being sensible about it. You\u2019ve a ride to the hospital and he is close enough to get there to support you.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice thing you\u2019re doing for your husband (minding the 2 YO for the week and sending him off for a break before the new one gets there).\n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t not make you the AH if you\u2019d changed your mind - heavily pregnant with a 2 YO in tow is a lot.\n\nPersonally I love the idea of sending them off for a week to relax before baby get there but wouldn\u2019t be comfortable that close to due date myself. But it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s you and if you\u2019re comfortable with that, you are the only known expert on you. Not anyone else.\nSo telling others to butt out is fine and does not make you an AH.", "Honestly this sounds just like my parents... and they have been together for 40 years.   They communicate, value time together, and apart, they have good friend groups that get along and have a system that works for them.  It always shocked people when my Dad would be doing a boy scout overnight hike on his anniversary weekend(camping with the bros), or my mom would say that she was doing Galintines day and not romantic stuff.  But it works for them.  They are on a cruise in the US Virgin islands right now and loving life.  \n\nIts a good system for them and it sounds like you have a good system too NTA", "They were against it then too but we\u2019re less worried due to it being my first baby", "\u2026 and they frequently stink", "That\u2019s crazy  they need to mind their own business !", "NTA. If you are both agreed on him going on the trip then, that's it. That's all that matters. You are a good partner and a good person for making sure your hubby is happy and gets to be with his friends again before one moves away. He is a good partner for discussing it rationally and coming to a joint decision about when it would affect you the least. I see a very healthy and loving relationship here. Everyone else can butt out.", "I can understand the family's concerns, I've been in a very similar situation where a family member was leaving his wife and 2wk old baby to go away for a few days and I questioned it at the time too.\nDifference being, as soon as his wife said she was happy with the situation I just kinda shrugged and said fair enough, it wouldn't be what I'd want but okay.\nNTA", "NTA. This is between you and your husband. If it is good with you two, they can butt out.", "NTA you guys sound great. Wishing you all a great trip/nesting time/delivery etc.", "Hahaha no. Omg you're awesome! See ppl think I'm weird cause I don't mind this either. You're not just letting him too you've told him hey, about x time would be perfect for your boys trip. So really their opinion on it is not relevant. You know your body, how you feel, what you want. That's what matters! You want your husband to have some me time too which is fantastic!\nJust because other people don't understand or they find it bad or wrong.. Doesn't mean it is.\n\nNTA!! Not at all!\n\nAlso, you're going to be more busy with the new baby initially, particularly if you breastfeed plus there's recovering from the birth.. So getting this time just you and your toddler is also great! You'll get just you time during the day.. I really don't see a down side! I know I know anything can happen, but as you said, you've prepared for \"in case of\". Also that he's only 2 hours away. Good on you! \ud83d\udc96 They expressed their feelings etc and it should be left as that, they wouldn't stop you told them myob.. NTA!"]}
