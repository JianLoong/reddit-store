Family needs to stay out of it.", "NTA --- If you have no problems with your hubby going away to have some fun with his friends before the baby is born then everybody should respect that and stay out of it, you have plans and things in place/set up should you go into labour while he is away so what's the problem??.", "NTA.\n\nYou're an adult and you can make your own decision.", "NTA. Don't you just love it when people are offended on your behalf? \ud83d\ude44 \n\nIt's your relationship, you want to have some healthy time apart before you get thrown into the chaos that a new baby can bring. That's completely normal and you have a plan in case you go into labor early.", "NTA you've discussed the situation with your partner and come to a decision. You understand and accept the risks of that decision.\n\nRemember,  opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one.", "NTA the only opinions that matter are yours and your husband's.  He'll only be two hours away and if he makes sure to be reachable at all times, it's not that big a deal.", "NTA. This is so healthy! I can understand them being concerned, but you two sound like you know what you're doing. It's not your first pregnancy. You have allthethings covered. You are happy to support your husband in this mutually-planned important thing. And, taking time off to rest and just be alone (during the day) prior to the birth of your second child sounds fantastic. \n\nThey should definitely drop this.", "NTA  they don\u2019t get tell you what to do ..he gets to go you have a plan in place what more do they want?? Did they interfere the first time ?", "NTA. - It sounds like you guys have thought of all the contingencies and the risk doesn\u2019t seem to be to great, so long as your 100% on board with this. If rather, you felt bad because both your lives are about to change again and you wanted him to have a little bit of freedom before the added responsibility and he was willing to jump on that\u2026 well then both of you might want to check your motivations. I say that as a father who would have been much too nervous to go off with the boys for 1 or 2 days, let alone 5\u2026 and two hours isn\u2019t all that close. This is just me, but yea I can understand why others are raising eyebrows about it. All that being said, it is your and his life, you guys do you. I wish you the best of luck with the upcoming baby addition!", "NTA\n\nIf you're fine with it, what reason do they have to not be?\n\nTell them it's not up to them to decide. Case closed.", "NTA. You and your husband both agreed to him going on the trip. You are perfectly fine with it. Your family needs to stay out of what is a decision that you two have already agreed on.", "NTA at all! \n\n You're both adults and it's clear this wasn't just him deciding to ditch you for some time off with friends.\nIf you both feel comfortable with the situation, that's all that matters. \n\nIn my opinion it is healthy to spend time with friends separately. You're more than just mom & dad or a married couple. \n\nEnjoy your week off with your daughter! Maybe have a nice girls night with a friend while you're at it!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
