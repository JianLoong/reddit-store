While it\u2019s not the best job and weird things tend to happen during my shifts, I enjoy the peace and quiet of it all.\n\nTo the actual issue at hand:\n\nAt 1 am, I got a call from a woman who told me her daughter had very low blood sugar, and that she could possibly die. \nThis is EXTREMELY paraphrasing what was said. \n\nI have no idea how diabetes works - this doesn\u2019t excuse my future behavior. But it does explain my confusion about the entire situation. \n\nI asked how she could know her daughters blood sugar levels, the mom explained, then explained she was in a town or two over and couldn\u2019t help. \n\nI was beginning to panic because I don\u2019t have a list that told me which room her daughter was staying in; her daughter was part of a team, so there was tons of girls in quite a few rooms. There was another team staying as well, so even more girls in rooms with no knowing who was in where.\n\nHere\u2019s where I think I\u2019m TA: \n\nThe mother grew frustrated with me, and said that I would have a dead kid on my hands if I didn\u2019t find her daughter. I - out of both panic at the situation and anger that she was (in my eyes) accusing me of being the reason her daughter was going to die - started talking over her briefly. I heard her say she was going to call the cops, then hung up.\n\nI hung up.\n\nI\u2019m typing that twice because that\u2019s the part about the situation that I truly believe I messed up.\n\nI grabbed the packets of papers that had the rooms of where all the girls were staying and knocked around. It\u2019s 1am and I\u2019m trying to find 1 girl out of dozens, with no one answering.\n\nThe first door seemed to be a coach, so she narrowed it down when she didn\u2019t know who I was talking about. I knocked on 2 more doors before two girls who knew the daughter opened theirs, but by then, the police and paramedics had arrived. \n\nThe daughter opened her door and she was holding a juice box - she was fine, thankfully.\n\nI later planned (and wrote) a letter to the mother apologizing, but the mother called back and let me know that while she appreciated my apology, I still got in the way of the emergency and could\u2019ve gotten her kid killed. She took my boss\u2019s name and said she\u2019d be speaking with him later.\n\nI\u2019m feeling immeanse guilt about the entire situation, and I\u2019m almost certain I\u2019ve lost a job. So I guess I just wanted to see if I was an AH in this situation.\n\nAm I the AH?\n\nEdit: The mom mentioned in her first call that no one was answering, hence why she called me, then the police when I hung up. Her second call had her telling me the daughters blood sugar level was in the 40\u2019s.\n\nEdit 2: There were 2 teams in the hotel. The coach I found was the coach of the other team, not of the diabetic girls\u2019 team. \n\nI did have a list for which girls were in which room. I gave it to the coach and never got it back. \n\nUpdate here:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/u/MyOwnDespair/s/DHamtjJ7Qn", "created_utc": 1693038618, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161pgna/aita_for_getting_in_the_way_of_getting_a_diabetic/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would ask your manager if you could talk about this and maybe do a single page 'protocol' or something, as this could easily happen again/different scenario, and may be useful to other staff.", "NTA I understand hanging up didn't feel great, *however,* getting off the phone afforded you the chance to start searching sooner, rather than later. It also broke the mom from focusing her panic on you, so she could call 911.\n\nYou were thrust into a very intense moment, and didn't immediately know how to handle it. That doesn't make you a bad person, especially since you immediately started searching once you were off the phone.", "NTA. If this kid is old enough to travel without her parents, she is old enough to manage her diabetes. YOU would never have been to blame for her illness or emergency. It sounds like she likely had an app that alerted her mom to her low blood sugar and mom panicked. The fact that mom couldn\u2019t get ahold of her, didn\u2019t know how to reach an adult associated with the trip, and didn\u2019t know what hotel room her daughter was in was HER fault, not yours. It may be worth discussing with the hotel managers that in case of a future emergency you need to have a list of what rooms all guests traveling in a group are assigned to. \n\nYou sound young- I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. You didn\u2019t know what to do and no one reacts well when they\u2019re being yelled at and being told they\u2019re the reason someone is going to die. If this mother truly believed her daughter couldn\u2019t manage her illness, she should never have let her kid travel on her own. Blaming you was never an acceptable option.", "NTA\n\nHanging up wasn\u2019t great but you tried to sort the situation out immediately after getting off the phone and went to try and find the person in trouble.\n\nI find it really unlikely that the girl would have been completely alone and her coach wouldn\u2019t have checked up on her regarding her insulin/blood sugar before going to bed? Sounds more like an overbearing mother than an actual emergency considering the girl was literally fine when you got there.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get fired. Probably a warning at most.", "NTA She has a coach she could call who should be the responsible adult handling this. Why on earth expect hotel staff to watch over your children?!? That is absolutely not part of your job. These team trips require responsible adults and they should be fully aware of the medical challenges of the kids.", "NTA - You aren't the paramedics.  Her daughter should have a phone herself or have given her mom her room number if she was diabetic and prone to a low sugar situation.  This is a failure by the mother and not you.  A little communication by mother and daughter would have gone a long way.", "Mom must have known her sugar was low thru a monitoring app that pairs with a device worn by her daughter who is old enough to go on a school trip without a parent. Why wouldn\u2019t the daughter let her mom know her room number upon arrival and it seems odd that she wouldn\u2019t have a cell phone for emergency, especially as a diabetic. You shouldn\u2019t have hung up on her but the chaperones in charge of the trip should have made note with front desk who the hotel should contact if a parent needed them. NTA", "Actually, you went and found the daughter.  The mother is being a bit unfair, as the daughter was also treating the hypo herself perfectly OK.  As someone with type 1 diabetics in the family, you did your best.", "I'm gonna say NTA. Sounds like you panicked and that's why you hung up. Not a good look, but also doesn't make you an AH. Especially since you've done all you could to check up and help right afterwards.", "Ok, so when you get questioned about this, \n\n\"I ended the call because the mother said she was going to call 911, which I think was the right thing to do, and in the meanwhile I wanted to find the daughter as quickly as possible.  I'm sorry if there was a misunderstanding and the mother thought I was rude, but I didn't want to delay looking for a child who was according to her mother dying right now, so I didn't have time to be more polite.  I literally hung up and went immediately to check on the daughter.\"", "NTA. I think you did your best", "I think your hotel is at fault for not training you on how to handle medical emergencies. I think the mother is at fault for not calling 911 or the equivalent, the coach for not knowing who the heck on their team is diabetic and the girl for not being more careful and if she was ok enough to answer the door she was ok to call her mum.", "NTA!!!\n\nI also work nights at a hotel and that should not happen. First of all, it's illegal what she's asking for because she's not the guest, and she should not be ordering you to check in on a guest. You are not a trained first aid professional, nor are you required to be. She is expecting you to be emergency response? She made some really dumb decisions by not calling paramedics first thing. \n\nHaving time to think about what I would do, I would probably refuse to help her in any way and just ask her to call paramedics. You do not want the liability of something else going wrong with her daughter. What if she had needed CPR? It was not your job to take care of a potential medical emergency. You should not feel guilty at all.", "But what did the mom want you to do once you\u2019ve found the daughter? I\u2019m confused why any of this is your fault.", "NTA, given your age and lack of training, and because you acknowledge that you shouldn\u2019t have hung up without reassuring the mom that you were off to find her daughter. \n\nBut, for future reference, a medical emergency of life or death isn\u2019t the time to ask questions like \u201cHow can you tell her blood sugar levels have dropped?\u201d I think that\u2019s what caused most of the frustration with you for the mom. In a medical emergency, speed is of the essence, and you should keep the questions to an absolute minimum. \u201cDo you know which room your daughter is in?\u201d and \u201cHave you called 911?\u201d was all you needed to ask. After that, just say you\u2019re off to go and find her and assist the emergency responders with locating them, and you would\u2019ve done a great job.", "But it sounds like you did everything right. Obviously the mum was just scared.", "No, hotels aren\u2019t always trained on everything.   YEARS ago, my diabetic friend was staying in a hotel and her key card wouldn\u2019t open the door, the hotel was pretty non-concerned, said they would put her and spouse in another room until maintenance came in the next day.  Husband said no, she is diabetic and needs the meds in the refrigerator.   Hotel solution was \u201cwe will send you to the emergency room right now and cover the bill\u201d.   Spouse said no, you will call maintenance and have them get the door open now.   Then you will give us another room.", "You didn't get in the way, you hung up and WENT TO FIND HER DAUGHTER.\n\nIn future your employer should make sure that you have a list of who is in which room and where are the adults in charge of groups.\n\nNTA", "YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEEL GUILTY FOR.\n\nPlease listen to me.", "NTA I don't know about your hotel policy, but mine is we don't give outside info on guests to anyone. Period.  You don't know who is really on the other end, if it was a truly life endangering situation, 911 from the parent gets called(like the mom did). I'd be in more trouble for giving out info on a minor guest than ignoring a phone call.  Good luck, if you get fired, then consider it a win, it's not worth working there if they don't have your back over this.  Anyone wants to argue my thoughts, hasn't worked in a hotel with someone calling to find out where their non custodial kid is..these situations are wild and happen more than they should.", "NTA, though hanging up was a questionable choice, you did what you had to do. Could the mother not ask the child what room the child was staying in?", "NTA mom called you instead of the police which is dumb. Did mom not have contact with her own child and contact with the coach. Do not feel bad or guilty because you did nothing wrong.", "This is a tough one. The mother said her daughter could die but apparently she was doing something more important so couldn't come? And why didn't she call the coach? If my daughter was away and had health problems. I'd make sure the coach knew and that I had a way of contacting them. I'd also make sure I knew what room they were in\n\n\nThe way I see it, you shouldn't hung up on her but other than that, you're blameless. So a very slight YTA but only for that.", "The mom is not wrong, technically a diabetic can die from that.  I'm not saying it was possibility in this situation but it absolutely is possible.  YTA for delaying medical help.  If you are unsure of what to do then you call 911 immediately and then your boss.  Yes, everything turned out ok but at the time of the call you knew NOTHING aboit what was going on.  If medical help for you was delayed, wouldn't you think the person delaying it is an asshole? \n\n\n\nYou did have a list and I have never worked at a hotel where people weren't individually listed by room number and name.  No, that doesn't mean that is where she will be at all times but it gives you a starting point.  I used to make these lists, for teen sports, adult sports, military groups, law enforcement groups, etc.  If the hotel you work at doesn't do that for teens then that's super sketchy and dangerous.  No decent hotel will just go \"here's a block of rooms, your minors have free reign\".  That's just liability issues galore. \n\n\nUse this as a learning experience.  Learn how to handle possible and real emergencies.  Go get certified in first aid training, they teach you stuff like that.  If you work public facing, especially in a job like that, this will not be the last time you run into a potential medical emergency.  Learn and figure it out before there is a situation where someone's life truly is at risk and that 30-60 seconds makes the difference.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The best course of action would have been to calmly explain to the mother that you needed to hang up and call 911. And then explain afterwards that you will go get the coach and locate her child. \n\nShe had no right to blame you, she was panicking and her panic came out wrong. You likely wouldn\u2019t have been held accountable because after hanging up you did make attempts to find the child. \n\nI doubt you\u2019ll lose your job, but it\u2019ll definitely be a coaching moment to make sure you know how to handle it. \n\nYou\u2019re very young and have next to know life experience, so this is going to be a very soft YTA. And only because you hung up. Not because you were delaying medical treatment or whatever the mother is claiming.", "I have dealt with this sort of situation twice with a diabetic friend (my neighbor, before I moved). I'm more than twice your age, was already well aware of the dangers of extreme low blood sugar, and still struggled with how to handle it without panicking.\n\nWhile diabetics can be taught to take care of themselves and manage their sugar, they can only do so as long as they are conscious and rational. Unfortunately, a sudden drop in blood sugar can quickly make them disoriented, and complete unconsciousness follows. Some people have diabetes that is prone to sudden swings like that, and it can happen so fast that they don't have time to get sugar in their system before they pass out. \n\nMy ex-neighbor has a continuous monitoring system that alerts both her and her father when her sugar goes below a certain level. Unfortunately, her father lives several hours' drive away. The first time I stepped in to her low-sugar situation, I saw paramedics hanging around outside her house unable to get in, and I let them in with the key she'd given me. They found her passed out on her bed. After that, I made sure her father had my number so he could contact me if it happened again. Some time later, he called and asked me to check on her because her alarm showed critically low sugar. This time I found her passed out on the floor, completely unresponsive.\n\nI had always been told that if you find someone unconscious from extremely low sugar, you can put sugar under their tongue and it will dissolve in their mouth. But when I called 911, they told me not to try to give her anything because of the danger she would choke on it. I just had to wait for the paramedics to get there, which didn't take long but felt like several lifetimes. They gave her an IV drip and revived her. \n\nI share all that to say, you were not responsible for this girl's situation and wouldn't have been responsible even if she hadn't survived. That's her mom's panic and fear talking. Your ONLY responsibility in this situation was to figure out which room this girl was in so that she could be checked on, and you did that as quickly as you could with the information that you had. If she had been unconscious, there wouldn't have been anything else you could have done except wait for the paramedics to arrive and direct them to her.\n\nI think the main problem was that because you hung up, the mom didn't have a way of knowing that you were, in fact, desperately looking for her daughter. That lack of knowledge certainly would have fed her fear, and I understand her frustration, but it did not in fact impair the emergency response to her daughter or put her at greater risk.  \n\n\nSo, I think there's one take-away for you in this situation, and one take-away for your hotel. For you, it's just to keep calm in an emergency, take a deep breath, and communicate clearly even if someone's upset with you. You messed that part up a bit, but you got right the far more important thing: finding the girl and making sure she was ok. For your hotel, the take-away is that they need a better system of keeping track of who is in what room, in case of emergencies like this. A single printed list probably doesn't cut it.\n\nI hope that helps. Please forgive yourself and don't beat yourself up. You shouldn't get fired. Talk to your boss about having better training and systems in place to handle emergencies for the future; they should be impressed with your care and initiative.", "NTA You did not get in the way. You had no way of knowing how to find the girl, so you didn\u2019t stand a chance. You went looking anyway and even found her. And you did not hinder the paramedics doing their job.\n\nI blame your education system for a 22yo not knowing how diabetes works, but I suggest you read up on it or have someone explain it to you.", "I\u2019m confused because a blood sugar reading of 40 to me means the person is massively hyperglycaemic not hypoglycaemic. Your blood sugar levels should normally be 4 to 6.  The girl was treated as hypo and I\u2019m glad the juice brought her sugar levels up and she is ok. Mum is understandably upset and concerned because she is not in a position to help. You did the best you could. Yo me the fault lies in the coach who should have returned the sheet straight away and also should have their own list of where the children are instead of just being able to narrow it down to a few rooms.  Can the receptionist reasonably be expected to chase the coach to get it back when they have been told by the coach that it would be returned?  I took many children abroad on school trips and we always had room lists and we checked every night physically that everyone was where they should be ie we had to see the person.  We also didn\u2019t have to borrow the hotels list other than to mark the room numbers next to the child\u2019s name on our lists and this was done at checkin and never left reception.  You are a hotel and not a medical facility and I think you did everything within your power to help. I really can\u2019t see how you did anything wrong. NTA", "NTA\n\nI take groups of students on trips that require overnight stays. I have medical forms on all of them. The parents have contact info for every adult in the trip and I have contact info for each kid as well. I have a list that shows which kids are in which rooms, that the hotel is also provided, but more importantly parents receive the list as well. The coach didn\u2019t do a good job here. One of my students on our April trip has a constant glucose monitor that sends her levels to moms phone. For the trip it was set up to also alert my phone if she fell low. That is not the hotel\u2019s job to do more about this. You didn\u2019t know what room the kid was in - how would you be expected to help? Seems crazy to me.", "NTA. The mom, the actual girl with diabetes, the freaking coach and the girls teammates are the people directly responsible for ensuring that medical emergencies of this type ( pretty common with diabetes) are handled according to a standard protocol, not by random calls to hotel front desks. \n\nYou did your best to understand and respond to the situation. \n\nWhy the hell didn\u2019t this dumb mom call daughter during normal hours to check which room she\u2019s in? Or go over sugar reading, food plan etc? \n\nWhy wasn\u2019t girl assigned a buddy to help with emergencies when away from home doing presumably strenuous activities ( traveling with a team and coach) which can trigger hypoglycemia?", "NTA  \nYou did what you could, and not everybody knows how to deal with diabetes, it's not part of your job.", "NTA this was a fail on the mom and coach's part, not yours.", "NTA. The coach is responsible for the health and well-being of the kids in their care when on tour. The girl should have gone to her coach and woken her up if she was having a medical emergency and the mother couldn't get through, or if she was too ill then one of the girls she was staying with should have gone to fetch the coach. \n\nThe first person you spoke to was also the coach and instead of going with you to find which girl was having the medical emergency she gave you a vague idea of where the girl might be and then let you carry on, on your own, to find out which room the girl was in. \n\nWhy didn't she have a roster of which girls were in which room? When we went on tour for school sports our coach assigned us to our rooms so they knew exactly where everyone was for exactly this kind of situation. Those children are all in her care, how could she not know who was in which room?\n\nThe parents trust her to look after their children when they are not in their care, especially if that child has a potentially life-threatening medical condition. It's not the hotel staff's job to be responsible for that. Her phone should have been on loud so any parent could get through, she should know which girls were in which room, and she should have gone with you to find the girl in question and make sure she was safe. \n\nThis all could have been avoided if the coach had done her job right in the first place. If anyone is TA here it's her.", "Seems like the hotel should have a policy that says names of who is in what room when it comes to teams OR a waiver of liability if a list isn\u2019t provided. It is not OP\u2019s responsibility to know how coaches separate their teams into rooms if there is no policy in place for it.

It was frightening.\n\nIt also reads to me as though the hotel doesn't have, or at least hasn't made you aware of, any policy that outlines what to do in situations like this and that is not good. I feel that the hotel manager needs to step in personally to deal with the aftermath of this, regardless of whose fault it ultimately is, and get guidelines place so that everyone knows what to do if there is a next time.\n\nSo yeah, it sounds to me as though you were unfortunately stuck in the middle of a badly-managed situation and I don't think it's your responsibility to deal with it from this point onwards. You found the girl in the end, she was fine and you apologised to the woman; the next steps are your manager's responsibility to handle.", "\u201cFucked up\u201d is harsh.

If possible, don't be defensive or show that you're emotional about this. Don't express guilt; just be very calm, collected, and mature about it. Explain exactly what happened, and say, \"I feel like I got the essential part right in finding the girl, but I know I could have handled things better with the mom if I hadn't panicked. I'd like to talk about how we can be better prepared for situations like this in the future.\" Then see how the conversation goes from there.\n\nI don't know your boss, whether they're a fair-minded person or someone who is likely to get wound up by the mom's (understandable) distress and make irrational decisions. But getting your perspective in first is bound to be the best.", "You sound like a gem to me. You will always have unreasonable expectations from guests and you sound like you cope admirably even to the point of researching common ailments and treatments snd getting a first aid certificate (by the way if you are a designated first aider in the uk you get extra pay). When mum was in an understandable panic - yes you hung up but you dealt with the situation and dealt with it well using your own common sense.  The alternative would have been to stay on the phone and not try to do something for her little girl.  There does not seem to be protocols in place to deal with medical emergency situations and maybe having one in the hotel would be useful and this posted on their website and on the doors beside the fire procedures.  It is also worth noting that when taking kids away you must do a risk assessment and have a medical form listing any condition a child has signed by the parent to give you consent to give authorisation of medical help in an emergency. Thankfully on the trips I took we never had one but we all knew the procedure and also knew the conditions kids had eg asthmatic , diabetics , cystic fibrosis , chrones, IBS etc and what to do in an emergency plus at least two of the teachers would have first aid qualifications.  This situation was not on you even though you are feeling responsible.

You didn\u2019t have that list, and you still went door to door to find the girl. I am hoping blame isn\u2019t put on you because honestly the kids were not under your supervision but the coach who brought them.", "Oh I see. Well everything else still stands. The ONLY thing you are safely able to do is find the child and involve authorities. Mom said she was calling the cops. You found the child. There is nothing, and I mean nothing that legally you would be protected from otherwise.", "She was terrified and put that on you - it\u2019s not yours to carry any longer - I see you here ensuring that you can learn from the situation and that is absolutely the best thing you can do :) Feel free to relieve yourself of all guilt & shame regarding this, put it down to experience & rest assured you\u2019ll be better equipped for the next challenge in the role!", "Yeah, that\u2019s a whole other issue I gotta deal with sometimes, but she wasn\u2019t asking for the room number.

I\u2019m not saying OP is in the wrong here, they are not at all. But educating yourself on this could be useful in the future or just overall helpful. Type 1s get a lot of unnecessary bullshit from people who equate all diabetes to \u201ceating too much sugar\u201d or aren\u2019t taken seriously in life threatening situations because people think they are overreacting or don\u2019t deserve sympathy because too many people think they did something to bring it upon themselves.

None of that would have made any difference here as the problem was the bad organisation from the mother and the coach.", "OP handled that well - the ONLY thing is she could do was: Which room, and then call the police.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr call the police and report it without knowing the room.", "Someone pointed out that the girl likely had a device that was linked to an app that alerts the mom if her blood sugar level was low. \n\nThe mom also mentioned not being able to get ahold of anyone, which likely includes her daughter. \n\nI\u2019m also guessing that the girls sleep deeper than others since they\u2019re athletes, so it\u2019s possible the roommate was asleep and the girl was trying to handle it without waking her since they had to be up early? \nThat\u2019s a guess though.", "Yeah.

I only know this because my cousin works in a hotel and has had this situation happen and the person staying in the room had had an angina attack that triggered their sensor thing to alert emergency services, but when they arrived the name was wrong, I think he said it was due to a typo.

Actually most awake people don\u2019t realize they\u2019re suffering confusion.. \n\n- The next comes a loss of consciousness.
