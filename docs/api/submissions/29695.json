It is of course more complicated if the reason you have an issue with that person is that they have wronged someone but aside from giving context I still don\u2019t think you have the standing to dictate other people\u2019s relationships. You can draw reasonable boundaries (if you include ex, I won\u2019t be attending), but trying to control other people makes them the AH.\n\nTell your mom that like it or not Amanda is your sister from your perspective and that the danger of insisting that you bond as sisters when you were young is that the relationship might take on a life of its own.\n\nUltimately the risk of introducing people to your loved ones is that they might indeed form their own relationships with those people.
