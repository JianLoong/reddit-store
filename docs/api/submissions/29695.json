It isn't your fault that they didn't.", "As someone who also has a complicated family (have two ex-stepmothers and two ex-stepsiblings), I think it's awesome that you've been able to forge and maintain your friend familyish relationship with Amanda. Parents can't / shouldn't shove kids (and their parent) together and insist you treat them like family and then rip you apart when they break up and expect you to just forget them.

Their relationship brought you together, and that's a great thing.", "NTA, its her failed relationship not yours. \n\nWhat sort of logic is that lol: \"You cant hang out with x because  their parent is my ex\"", "NTA\n\nI never understand how some people think that relationship is something that can be turned on or turned off at a moment's notice, like a computer or an oven. \n\nYour mother was with Jim = Amanda is your sister\n\nYour mother isn't with Jim = Amanda is a stranger\n\nThe world doesn't revolve around your mother and her failed plans.", "NTA.

AITA?\n\n\nYour Mom wants you to mindlessly back her up as she winds her way through life.  She wants this, then she wants that, where is the consideration for your feelings? I imagine when you were younger it would have been awesome to get some one on one time with mom.  \n\n\nPretty sure if your Mom was in your shoes she'd tell you to \"grow up and get over it\".\n\n\nI think that is sound advice.\n\n\nNTA by a long shot.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not an accessory in your mom's life, where you can be forced to socialize with someone 7 years your senior (a huge age difference when one of those people is under 16 years old) because it suited her goals and then forced to stop interacting with that same person the moment you're more at ease with it because it doesn't suit your mom.\n\nYour opinion was not asked back then and it limited the one on one time you could have had with your mom. It's like everything in her life has to be about herself. We'll, she can learn to deal with this situation like a grown up\nIf she can't risk being in the same room as her ex, she can spend time with you elsewhere.", "NTA, she pushed for this. She got it. Bringing people in and out of your child's life is kind of shitty, she needs to grow up and accept the situation for what it is. Seeing Jim should not be something to hide from, she must have had to interact with your father for years, at least until you turned 18. Dealing with exes is simply a part of life, and unless Jim did something truly traumatic to her, which you have not indicated, there is no reason for her to act like this.", "NTA", "NTA - your life, you get to pick who you're friends with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
