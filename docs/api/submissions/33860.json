We\u2019ve remained very close, so close in fact that we bought a home 2 mins down the road from theirs & and also recently both gave birth to our first babies who are 6 weeks apart. \n\nMike travels a lot for work. One night back from his trips and over for dinner at our place, they announce they are moving countries for two years, and in the same breath are putting their house for rent and coming to stay with us for 2 months. \n\nBoth my husband and I were shocked but focused on the good news of this exciting opportunity and congratulating them. Later in the kitchen, Mike asked my husband and I about moving in, and without us having had a conversation my husband said it would be chaotic with the two babies in the house who are on different schedules and mike immediately said no worries and they will find other arrangements. \n\nYes, it would be very chaotic with two young babies, and only one functional downstairs bathroom, with both of us WFH (office spaces set up in common areas) but in reality my husband knows how absolutely overwhelmed and anxious I get at the mere idea of house guests. I am a very OCD person (my friends know this) and a perfectionist that takes on pressure of being a perfect host. At this time in my life I simply do not have the mental or physical capacity to do any more. \n\nI\u2019ve recently gone back to work where as Nina is still on maternity leave. I juggle work from home, baby (we have no help), expressing milk 6 times a day (meaning I have my boobs hanging out whilst I multitask) and cleaning up after ourselves. There\u2019s never time to cook so lots of the time hubby and I skip meals or order out. \n\nI get apprehensive even when my own family who live overseas comes to visit with the pressure to \u201cmanage\u201d the house and looking after the house guests. \n\nBut I go above and beyond for the people I love, and in any other time in my life I would have adjusted and put my own issues of OCD and anxiety aside, this particular time in my life is just very overwhelming as a new first time mom to a young one. \n\nWe thought things were all fine after my husband and Mike spoke and it wasn\u2019t brought up for two months. However, we hosted a leaving dinner for Mike and Nina, which turned into a 5 hour barrage of how horrible assholes we are because they expected we\u2019d help and we said no to them staying with us, when other friends who are no where as close have offered much more than us. \n\nTo be clear, we offered help with moving multiple times, ran errands like groceries etc just said an initial \u201cmaybe not a great idea\u201d to live with us. \n\nWe feel terrible we could not live up to the expectations our friends held for us, and sincerely apologised whilst also acknowledging their feelings, but at the same time part of me feels frustrated to have been put in this position and made to feels so horrible and say sorry profusely for simply saying no to something that made us so uncomfortable.\n\nSo, are we the assholes?", "created_utc": 1703685672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s1cpl/aita_for_saying_no_to_friends_who_wanted_to_stay/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your friends knew you at all they would have never asked. I'm very picky about who is allowed in my safe haven. No one stays here but my partner and I. My friends know this about me. They wouldn't ask to stay here even though there is enough room.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nOnly your friends are terrible in this situation. Even close relatives are not always allowed to stay for 2 months. Why do they consider themselves entitled to offer this at all? They may not rent out the house for these 2 months and live in it, or rent an apartment/room in a hotel for this period. You should think about whether they are such good friends for you or not.", "NTA! I can understand your friends letting you know they were disappointed, but a 5-hour beat down? Nah! You really shouldn't have put up with it but I guess that's a testament to your goodwill that you did. You're much better person than I.", "NTA. They presumed without asking that they could stay at your house for 2 months. That is unbelievable. I know you are close but assuming you can stay with someone for 2 months is completely unreasonable. No matter how close friends you are with someone that is not a reasonable assumption. Especially when they know you, therefore know you about your anxiety, OCD and new baby!\n\nHonestly, it's probably good they are moving abroad for 2 years.", "NTA. A few days ok, a couple of months no freaking way.", "NTA\n\nNewsflash - these people are not your real friends , real friends would not assume to live in your home nor would they berate you for not accepting this. They were wrong to put you in this position especially when you have a newborn. They can take up the offer from the \u201cother friends \u201c.\n\nThey will be away 2 years and it\u2019s unlikely you will remain friends when (if) they return. Call a day on this and put it out of your mind. Congratulations on the new baby", "NTA....they didn't even actually ask you if they could stay with you for a couple months, they made the assumption that it would be ok to do.\n\nYou don't have an obligation to letting them live with you. And having two little ones on different schedules makes any household difficult at best, let alone when they're not siblings and you have two more adults living in the home. \n\nThey can be hurt, but they held an expectation and determined it would be met and not a problem, without a discussion with you first or asking", "NTA. All your reasons for saying no are valid, but not even relevant \u2014 because they didn't even ask if this would work for you! It takes a lot of nerve to think you can just tell someone you're moving in with them for two months, and your friends have more than a lot of nerve to do what they did.", "NTA. AT ALL.\n5 hours? I would have kicked them out within the first 10 minutes. They were WRONG, not you.\nThey assumed they could stay with you. They didn\u2019t even ask you. They just informed you both that they were staying with you for TWO MONTHS! No way.", "NTA.  Their nerve is astounding. Nice of them to show their true colors to your entire friend group at the last party; now everyone is aware of their entitlement.", "NTA\nLiterally nothing else matters except that your friends invited themselves to stay in your home without discussing it with you. You don't need reasons or excuses to say no.  People do not get to impose on you like that.  Time to end this \"friendship\". These people are asking (demanding) too much from you. Friends wouldn't do this,  these people are selfish and unreasonable.", "NTA. Who the Hell plans to move in with somebody without even ASKING them first?!!! Also, you have perfectly good reasons why it would be a horrible idea and even if it was just down to you not really wanting to that is your right as it's your house!", "NTA. It is extremely entitled for them to have just assumed they could move in, which is probably why they handled it completely wrong at every step.\n\nLearn not to say you're sorry when entitled people demand unreasonable things. It's hard, but it's a skill well worth learning.", "NTA - Mike and Nina are not your friends. They just want to use your house as a hotel to save money. If you actually allow them to say, it will be a disaster.", "Seriously?  Stop worrying, you\u2019re so NTA.  To just state they\u2019re moving in for 2 months is extremely entitled\u2026.then attacking you when you say no, yikes.  Your husband is a keeper.  So glad he addressed it immediately and has your back.", "NTA. Your alleged friends are rude and demanding.\n\nTelling you they were moving and needed housing for a couple of months shouldn't be followed by an expectation of staying with you. If you had offered, it would be one thing, but it's awfully demanding to just tell you they're moving in.\n\nI think you've either outgrown this friendship or finally realized they're not friends", "NTA. And your reasons are irrelevant. It's perfectly acceptable to have said no purely on the basis you didn't want two adults and a newborn moving into your house for 2 months. \n\nAnd the fact that they rented out the house early and were looking to move in with friends (with a baby!) rather than find their own place suggests money was an issue. So I suspect if you had let them move in you would have found them mooching off you and being a financial burden as well as a practical inconvenience.", "NTA at all.  They've certainly some stones just telling you they're moving in to stay with you in your house until they leave in 2 months.\n\nIt would be cheeky enough to do it if it were just them 2 and you and your husband, but add in 2 newborns is... No.\n\n>However, we hosted a leaving dinner for Mike and Nina, which turned into a 5 hour barrage of how horrible assholes we are because they expected we\u2019d help and we said no to them staying with us, when other friends who are no where as close have offered much more than us. \n\nWhy did you and your husband let them attack you like this, and for so long! Talk about them being ungrateful, I'd have told them to fuck off to those other friends then to help with running errands etc that you've been doing to help with no thanks whatsoever", "NTA - the audacity of them announcing they were moving in with you.", "NTA. To me it would be fun and exciting, but not to everyone else. And really, they need to ask and not put you on the spot.", "NTA.  Holy crap.  The moment a \"friend\" announced they would be staying with me rather than asking to stay is the moment that person goes from \"friend\" to \"trespasser.\"", "NTA, Here\u2019s where you say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t feel we did enough to help you. The entire situation came as a surprise, and you really put us on the spot when you announced you were moving in with us. Unfortunately, life\u2018s circumstances didn\u2019t permit us to accommodate you at that moment. I hope we can move past this and continue our friendship, but if that\u2019s not possible, we wish you well.\u201d  At this point the ball is in their court. Quite honestly, they had a lot of nerve expecting you to put them up.", "NTA. Think how awkward it would be when you have to start the eviction process. Yikes.", "They just announced they were going to stay with you without asking you first? Wtf", "Who TF just assumes they can move into their friends house for 2 months and TELLS them it's happening over dinner? The brass balls on them to think you'd be tripping over yourselves to *house* them for that amount of time. \n\nYour reasons aren't even needed. Their poor planning and sense of entitlement are to blame. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. The cheek! Get a rental, get an RV, stay in a motel, just saying \"we'll move in with you...\" Not bloody likely! For all the reasons you put, but mainly because, an Ben Franklin possibly said, \"Guests, like fish, begin to smell after 3 days...\"", "Woah, Nelly! There is something seriously askew in this relationship with Mike and Nina if they feel they can just announce to you that they are moving in with you! They didn't even ask, they just announced it! And the way you are twisting yourself into knots to explain why you are not at fault for not wanting these people to move into your home without so much as a \"by your leave!\" And then they throw a 5 hour tantrum because you said no!\n\nThe only way I can make sense of this is that Mike and Nina have been stomping all over your boundaries for so long that you've forgotten what normal boundaries look like.\n\nThey shouldn't have announced they were moving in. They should have asked, and actually they shouldn't have asked because their ask was too big.\n\nYou should not have to feel guilty that you said no. You do not need to explain why you said no, to us or to anyone else. \"I don't want to\" is reason enough. You can just say, \"What? No! Are you crazy!??? No.\"\n\nMike and Nine were way out of line for ranting at you for 5 hours because you failed to comply with their orders.\n\nHopefully, time out of their company will give you the room to put normal boundaries back in place. People this presumptuous are fairly unusual. Hopefully your entire friend group isn't this entitled.\n\nNTA but Nina and Mike are.", "NTA\n\nMoving in for 2 months?  NO WAY.  Even asking is an AH move, but to announce they were?  wow", "NTA! Your friends are being ridiculous", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
