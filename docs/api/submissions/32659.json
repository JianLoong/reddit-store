You have combined these distinctly different issues and then indulged your temper.

They're right. They point out that the only impact your misdirected aggression is having is to make them and yourself more frustrated.\n\nYou can step it up a notch; be the A and create even greater hostility between yourself and your fellow community members; but in the end you'll only have turned your irritation into another real and overwhelming frustration. You'll be even more hated by your neighbors than you are now and you'll still be bleeding out financially for the management's negligent behavior toward the property. \n\nA better solution would be to focus on resolving your frustration and stop getting distracted by mere irritations. Stop fighting with children and start fighting with the adults. Go put up the pictures and statements about the management around town so others will know not to buy in to the community; that the developer is only focused on ditching these units so they can move on to their next project.

I've actually logged in on my computer to answer because this is a long one. Skip to the last paragraph if you want the short story.\n\nWe currently have a case logged with QBCC (Queensland Building and Construction Commission) because there are over 200 defects that the builder and developer are refusing to rectify (think bad paint, cracking, water tank peeling and leaking, loose rails and fences, etc). The construction of this building was designed and arranged between developer and builder before COVID supply chain disruptions... and based on pre-COVID price spikes. So the builder had to honour their building contracts and agreed-upon prices through COVID whilst paying post-COVID premiums. Therefore, the builder has made fuck-all in terms of revenue and are threatening bankruptcy. So the developer is panicking because if the builder declares bankruptcy the rest of their estate development (they've only completed about 60%) is fucked and they've sold all units off the plan, so they'd have a huge problem in their hands. The developer knows we can't afford to fight, and they would rather keep the builder happy and take their chances with us as they consider it highly unlikely that we will follow through with our legal action threats.\n\nA lot of the fire and safety compliance issues we have were a result of 'fishy' construction (height of doors, signage, etc), which would go back on the builder, not so much the developer (although they would have had to sign off at the end). Therefore, our body corporate admin has told us 'you can kick and scream, but unless you're willing to take them to court, they will not finish a half-assed fire and safety job'. These compliance issues were heightened because the manager failed to pass on the quotes to our committee (from May 2022 onwards) so we weren't even aware that we had issues. Now we're going to have to pay extra (over $10k) for contractor time and resources to rectify the issues (there is also an extra $10k worth of issues that are considered defects that we can't afford to fix and we are really pressing the developer to act on). Also, keep in mind, caretaker and developer are in bed together.\n\nSo in short... we can't afford to fight the developer, the developer wants to keep the builder happy, the developer is buddies with the caretaker and they're willing to take their chances on us not seeking legal advice because we are a new building and we haven't yet saved enough to afford it."]}
