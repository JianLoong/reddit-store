I\u2019m going through a bit of a Pam\u2019s-microwave-note situation. I\u2019ve been living in an estate for two-ish years. It\u2019s just a small community with only one road going in and out of it. There are a couple of apartment buildings in it and some townhomes (about 30). \nAnyway, we all pay fees (we call them body corporate levies) which are used for different things (particular to each building), including maintenance of our communal facilities: small park, pool, gym, multi purpose room, barbecue area.\n\nLately we\u2019ve had a sudden growth as more and more homes are being built, some newcomers and more and more families with children. The rules to the community facilities are pretty clear (no glass in pool, clean up after yourself in all areas, etc), yet we\u2019ve had a lot of people not follow them. \n\nToday I was on my balcony mopping the floor and saw some children trying to jump the fence into our private park and pool area. I clapped my hands loudly and yelled \u201cget down\u201d. They quickly got down and just stood around. \nShortly after a woman pushing a supermarket trolley walks up and asks them why they aren\u2019t in yet, and the children say \u201ca Karen told us to get down\u201d. Clearly the parent knew they were planning on jumping the fence. That fence Perspex glass has already gotten broken and fixed again (that prevents people from opening the gate from the street and it covers the top of the fence), and I\u2019m starting to think that it was this exact thing that broke it the first time around, people jumping the fence.\n\nWe have on-site management but he\u2019s useless (he\u2019s 85 years old and we\u2019re currently trying to get him out). \n\nI\u2019ve made a pretty condescending decision-making map (those that ask yes or no questions) and I\u2019m thinking of putting it up myself. Also, my balcony is on the top floor, so I was able to take very good photos of the park and pool area and the people that were breaking the rules. I also know where they live because I watch them get back to their townhome. \n\nI\u2019m just sick of having our body corporate levies go up because of careless people who break our facilities, and I\u2019m also sick of having our facilities broken by people who don\u2019t look after what we have.

You have combined these distinctly different issues and then indulged your temper. This results in your determination to \"solve *the* issue\" (as if the two are one) by blasting away at your irritants (careless children, etc.) while doing nothing to resolve your very real frustration. That makes you the A.\n\nThe children have already called you out for your mistake, and while you heard them, you weren't paying attention to the information they were imparting when they called you \"Karen\": You are angry about your utter lack of control about one thing, so you're asserting your authorita against people you feel are not as powerful an opponent; children. They're right. They point out that the only impact your misdirected aggression is having is to make them and yourself more frustrated.\n\nYou can step it up a notch; be the A and create even greater hostility between yourself and your fellow community members; but in the end you'll only have turned your irritation into another real and overwhelming frustration. You'll be even more hated by your neighbors than you are now and you'll still be bleeding out financially for the management's negligent behavior toward the property. \n\nA better solution would be to focus on resolving your frustration and stop getting distracted by mere irritations. Stop fighting with children and start fighting with the adults. Go put up the pictures and statements about the management around town so others will know not to buy in to the community; that the developer is only focused on ditching these units so they can move on to their next project. Report to the media in your area that those who buy-in now will be inheriting damaged property that will cost them dearly, financially, in many and unexpected ways. Apply your creativity and photography skills to resolve your frustration and maybe do something nice for those irritating kids you've been harassing.", ">So\u2026 would I be the AH if I put the signs and their photos up in our communal area?\n\nYes, YWBTA.

If you can name and shame so can your targets.", "You are planning on taking photos of neighborhood kids and posting those pictures with the names of the kids. You are planning on publicly defaming people. And you don't have any shred of authorization to either monitor the goings on in the neighborhood or to publicly shame people.
