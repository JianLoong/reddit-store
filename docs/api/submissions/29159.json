{"id": 29159, "submission_id": "17akcom", "title": "AITA for not letting my \"friend\" move in?", "selftext": "So I (35F) live in a 1 bedroom apartment with just my dog, my cat, and myself. One of my friends (33F) that I have known for about 20+ years recently broke up with her boyfriend (39M). She lived in his home that he bought alone before they got together. They were together for about 5 years. I'm not sure what caused the break up but my friend asked to stay at my place on the couch for just a few days until she got her own place.\n\nHere's the problem. I told her she could stay 1 week and then she needed to be out. My place isn't that big and she sleeps dang near all day. I hated being forced to stay in my room until she woke up. I couldn't even make a cup of coffee in my living room until she woke up otherwise she would scream at me.\n\nAfter the week, I woke her up and told her she needs to clean up her mess (she is very messy) and go. It wasn't until about 10am that I woke her up but I was done! She started screaming at me to get out of \"her\" room (my living room) and leave her alone. \n\nWhere I live, unless they live at a residence for 30+ days, I have every right to kick them out. I started cleaning up her stuff and told her she had 1 hour before I called the police. \n\nShe is now telling all our mutual friends that I said she could fully move in and then changed my mind. Everything that we talked about was either over the phone or in person so I have no proof of our agreement. Our friends are 50/50 at the time.\n\nShould I have given her more time to find a safe place to stay? Or should I have made a legal agreement on paper before she stayed? \n\nI do feel bad but it's my place and I shouldn't be forced to stay in my room until she chooses to wake up.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the comments. I sent a group message to everyone including those who don't agree with me. I told them I'm sorry for how they feel but I don't have room for someone to move in. I also said that I am NOT going to hide in my room just so someone can sleep the day away. I have a dog that I have to take out to go potty. I also like my morning coffee and breakfast.\nA lot of them have apologized and said they heard that I let her have my room while I slept on the couch. Haha yea right\n\nEdit 2: Just so everyone knows, i didn't threaten with the police or only giving her an hour until after she started throwing and breaking my things. I also did remind her daily she only had a week and asked if she had made other arrangements yet", "created_utc": 1697612006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17akcom/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_move_in/", "score": 386, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've already let this person stay 6 days too many.  The very first time she abused you this way, you should have given this ingrate her walking papers.  There's no legal agreement that is going to make her behavior acceptable.

I know you guys have been friends since you were teens, but what kind of friend acts like she has been? Screaming at you when you offered to let her stay on your couch and basically take over your home for a week? How dare her. Then, tell all your mutual friends that you agreed to have her move in? First of all, it is absolutely shitty of her to do to you after you graciously let her stay with you at all. Second of all, even if you had agreed for her to move in, it is NO ONES business if you decided you changed your mind after her behavior. You shouldn't be judged by your other 'friends' regardless. \n\nMakes me wonder, did she lie on purpose about that, or is she so delusional that she really believes you did invite her to move in? She reminds me of my alcoholic narcissistic older sister.\n\nIf your other friends believe her and are judging, then THEY should take her in and see how they like it. I'm sorry, but I'd double-check my 'friend group' if I were you.", "NTA\n\nShe was acting like a jerk.\n\nYou took on you cause your space is small to let her in and she became entitled.\n\nThee rule when you are a live in guest is to be evanescent.\n\nOf course she twisted your words now.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and was clear from the beginning.\n\nTake care.", "NTA\n\nI'd have kicked her out the first time she yelled at me for trying to move around in MY OWN HOME.

You have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA. You have told her a week. She should have made other arrangements or at least talked to you about staying longer.

You let her stay with you and she screams at you? The first time that happened, I'd have kicked her out. Instead, you tiptoe around her. Go make your coffee whenever you damn well please.

But you should have reminded her the day before that she was moving out.  Waking her up and telling her she had an hour to pack probably just cost you a 20+ year friendship.  It\u2019s why she\u2019s lying about you now.  She feels disrespected.  She\u2019s obviously a terrible \u201croomate\u201d, but I hope she was a good friend before this.  Was it worth it?  Only you will know.\n\nP.S. As for your friends, when they talk about how you said she could move in permanently, ask them where she was supposed to be living.  Remind them that you only have a 1-bedroom apartment and no bedroom for her.  That will probably highlight that your former friend is lying.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nobody should have to tolerate screaming from anyone, let alone in their own home!! If this \u201cfriend\u201d had been kinder & more respectful, OP would likely have let her stay longer - she played herself and has to deal with the consequences. The audacity and entitlement of this horrible person is staggering. \n\nOP, don\u2019t let her lies convince you that your actions were anything other than kind & accommodating. You compromised your own living space longer than 99% of people would, tidied all her mess & let her sleep in on the day she was evicted! You\u2019re clearly a decent person, but decent people are more at risk of being bulldozed by assholes who only care about themselves & their own narrative.\n\nLet your friends be 50/50 for a while. Anyone who believes her but isn\u2019t willing to have her as a guest & to help out the way you did, they have no right to an opinion on your actions. Let her cycle through the homes of that 50% who believed her lies. People don\u2019t change, and I suspect they\u2019ll learn pretty quickly just how horrific her behaviour is and come crawling back with apologies. If they don\u2019t come crawling back, then clearly they weren\u2019t worth your time and friendship anyway. \n\nTake a step back and feel proud of the fact you tried to help out a friend in need. You extended a kindness, despite the fact it made you uncomfortable from day 1. You cannot control how another person behaves, and her terrible response/actions are not your responsibility.
