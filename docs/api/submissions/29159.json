One of my friends (33F) that I have known for about 20+ years recently broke up with her boyfriend (39M). She lived in his home that he bought alone before they got together. They were together for about 5 years. I'm not sure what caused the break up but my friend asked to stay at my place on the couch for just a few days until she got her own place.\n\nHere's the problem. I told her she could stay 1 week and then she needed to be out. My place isn't that big and she sleeps dang near all day. I hated being forced to stay in my room until she woke up. I couldn't even make a cup of coffee in my living room until she woke up otherwise she would scream at me.\n\nAfter the week, I woke her up and told her she needs to clean up her mess (she is very messy) and go. It wasn't until about 10am that I woke her up but I was done! She started screaming at me to get out of \"her\" room (my living room) and leave her alone. \n\nWhere I live, unless they live at a residence for 30+ days, I have every right to kick them out. I started cleaning up her stuff and told her she had 1 hour before I called the police. \n\nShe is now telling all our mutual friends that I said she could fully move in and then changed my mind. Everything that we talked about was either over the phone or in person so I have no proof of our agreement. Our friends are 50/50 at the time.\n\nShould I have given her more time to find a safe place to stay? Or should I have made a legal agreement on paper before she stayed? \n\nI do feel bad but it's my place and I shouldn't be forced to stay in my room until she chooses to wake up.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the comments. I sent a group message to everyone including those who don't agree with me. I told them I'm sorry for how they feel but I don't have room for someone to move in. I also said that I am NOT going to hide in my room just so someone can sleep the day away. I have a dog that I have to take out to go potty. I also like my morning coffee and breakfast.\nA lot of them have apologized and said they heard that I let her have my room while I slept on the couch. Haha yea right\n\nEdit 2: Just so everyone knows, i didn't threaten with the police or only giving her an hour until after she started throwing and breaking my things. I also did remind her daily she only had a week and asked if she had made other arrangements yet", "created_utc": 1697612006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17akcom/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_move_in/", "score": 1636, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First of all, it is absolutely shitty of her to do to you after you graciously let her stay with you at all. Second of all, even if you had agreed for her to move in, it is NO ONES business if you decided you changed your mind after her behavior.
