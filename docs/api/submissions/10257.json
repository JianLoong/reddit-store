My mother in law has witnessed this and she doesn\u2019t hide it that she doesn\u2019t care.

His sister lives in M\u00e9xico and has 4 kids with different daddies and she lives with a POS man who isn\u2019t any of her kids father. When my husband lived in M\u00e9xico, he had to go to school and work from the age of 9 since his father had passed away. My MIL laughs and says that she didn\u2019t have to work when her husband died because her 9 year old son supported her and his sister. So early on she didn\u2019t care that her young son had to quit school after middle school to support them. My husband has been here in the US for 20 years working hard for me and his kids. (I worked as well until I became disabled 4 yrs ago) As my husband and father of my children, his 1st and only obligation is us and our well-being. My MIL got a taste of the \u201cbetter life\u201d when I helped her obtain her visa and flew her over here to meet her grandkids in person. She has always been resentful of my kids because they have 2 working parents that take very good care of them. My SIL (sister in law) has never wanted to work to take care of her own kids. My MIL worked to support her daughter and each grandkid she was left with. Plus It is so much easier to pick up the phone and call her brother for money. Needless to say she frequently calls asking to \u201cborrow\u201d money she doesn\u2019t have the intention of paying back. Occasionally lying that she needs money for things my MIL needs. My MIL knows how hard her son works and could care less about his financial obligations here. As long as she is getting her money, nothing else matters.

I have my own money and if I don\u2019t ask him for anything, why could they??", "created_utc": 1676699706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11589cp/aita_for_stopping_my_hardworking_husband_from/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may be fighting a losing battle, but you're certainly not an AH for trying.", "NTA, but this will not resolve the problems, I predict.  Husband needs training and disability insurance for the day, coming soon, his body wears out.  And he probably needs to send his mom and sister money if he can, for his own peace of mind.  \n\nThe better route might be to see a financial planner and arrange the insurance he needs, as well as set up a budget for what your family can afford to send his relatives.  Save it up and dole it out as demanded with the agreement between you that he will not exceed that budgeted amount.", "NTA Your SIL and MIL in-law sound like they're ok with your husband working himself to death.  If it were me,  I absolutely would stop him sending any money except maybe for a birthday present or Christmas.", "NTA!", "NTA. \u201cYou don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat.\u201d -John Smith", "NTA\n\nI feel bad for your husband.

Get your husband therapy, if its possible put a limit on your bank and try to go NC with them.\n\nI'm not sure how effective your methods are going to be though.", "It sounds like you're ordering your husband around, which in general is not good for your relationship, although the specific scenario you outline here is one that makes us sympathetic.\n\nI would be concerned that if you try to order your husband too much, he will either go behind your back and do what he wants anyway, or it could lead to a problem with your marriage.

You BOTH need to be on the same page about this. He, like most people who come from families or cultures where you help the family out (getting a better job/life, so helping out those \"left behind\"), will have difficulty accepting he shouldn't send money/as much money back home. You are likely not going to be able to stop him completely, but you may be able to get him to ease up some. Sit down with a financial planner and work out budgets. Have a household budget (bills/food/etc. General household stuff), an education budget for YOUR kids (college funds, etc.), savings in the event of unexpected bills (medical, etc.), maybe even a vacation account (we all need to take some time to decompress every now and again). Do these within a reasonable framework. Make sure that you make it abundantly clear that you love him dearly and want him around for a long time, especially for the kids, and right now you see him working himself to a very early grave. After everything for the immediate family is well in hand and taken care of, if there is anything left over you BOTH can discuss how much can then be sent to his family without him adding on jobs or extra work. The only reason for him to add on jobs or extra work is if it's needed for the basic needs of his immediate family (you, him, and the kids), not for his family who are capable of working and just not wanting to. Unfortunately, his family are going to flip out with this act, because they won't want their cash cow cut off, and they WILL blow up phones/social media in an attempt to pressure him and make him bend to their will again. You both are going to need to be prepared for this, and stand strong. If your husband agrees to everything but is afraid that he will cave to his mother's and sister's demands, perhaps work it out that you will be the one taking the financial reins and make it clear to his family this is the case and no amount of begging, pleading, threatening, or anything else will change matters. You may also want to look into therapy of some sort for him to be able to build the strength he needs to stand up to his family.", "NTA it sounds like they're just using him for his money and as you said it's not like you're trying to keep the money to yourself you have your own money in able to get ur own things\n\nSIL should have thought about how she was going to support those children before she decided to open her legs, it sounds completely harsh but people need to realise that when you bring people into the world it cost money so you really should think before you do so.", "YTA for the word \u201cforbid\u201d. You can\u2019t dictate to your husband where the money he earns should go, especially as you have your own money. The better approach would be to have a conversation and let him know how you feel and see the sacrifices he is making for people who won\u2019t help themselves", "YTA because you're telling him what to do and not giving him a choice, just like his mother did when he was 9.\n\nYou don't like your SIL or MIL, neither do I, they sound like garbage people, but you don't get to dictate his relationship with his family to him.\n\nAnd BTW, he doesn't have an \"obligation\" to you either, he's there because he loves you and chooses to be there. Just like he chooses to support his sister and mother, even if they don't deserve it."]}
