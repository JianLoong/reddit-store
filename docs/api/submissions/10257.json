You BOTH need to be on the same page about this. He, like most people who come from families or cultures where you help the family out (getting a better job/life, so helping out those \"left behind\"), will have difficulty accepting he shouldn't send money/as much money back home. You are likely not going to be able to stop him completely, but you may be able to get him to ease up some. Sit down with a financial planner and work out budgets. Have a household budget (bills/food/etc. General household stuff), an education budget for YOUR kids (college funds, etc.), savings in the event of unexpected bills (medical, etc.), maybe even a vacation account (we all need to take some time to decompress every now and again). Do these within a reasonable framework. Make sure that you make it abundantly clear that you love him dearly and want him around for a long time, especially for the kids, and right now you see him working himself to a very early grave. After everything for the immediate family is well in hand and taken care of, if there is anything left over you BOTH can discuss how much can then be sent to his family without him adding on jobs or extra work. The only reason for him to add on jobs or extra work is if it's needed for the basic needs of his immediate family (you, him, and the kids), not for his family who are capable of working and just not wanting to. Unfortunately, his family are going to flip out with this act, because they won't want their cash cow cut off, and they WILL blow up phones/social media in an attempt to pressure him and make him bend to their will again. You both are going to need to be prepared for this, and stand strong. If your husband agrees to everything but is afraid that he will cave to his mother's and sister's demands, perhaps work it out that you will be the one taking the financial reins and make it clear to his family this is the case and no amount of begging, pleading, threatening, or anything else will change matters. You may also want to look into therapy of some sort for him to be able to build the strength he needs to stand up to his family.", "NTA it sounds like they're just using him for his money and as you said it's not like you're trying to keep the money to yourself you have your own money in able to get ur own things\n\nSIL should have thought about how she was going to support those children before she decided to open her legs, it sounds completely harsh but people need to realise that when you bring people into the world it cost money so you really should think before you do so.", "YTA for the word \u201cforbid\u201d. You can\u2019t dictate to your husband where the money he earns should go, especially as you have your own money. The better approach would be to have a conversation and let him know how you feel and see the sacrifices he is making for people who won\u2019t help themselves", "YTA because you're telling him what to do and not giving him a choice, just like his mother did when he was 9.\n\nYou don't like your SIL or MIL, neither do I, they sound like garbage people, but you don't get to dictate his relationship with his family to him.\n\nAnd BTW, he doesn't have an \"obligation\" to you either, he's there because he loves you and chooses to be there. Just like he chooses to support his sister and mother, even if they don't deserve it.", "NTA although personally I would change the way you approach it.  I am Mexican and my fianc\u00e9 supported her family for three years, so I understand the culture involved.  They hold a brother responsible and excuse others.  It was very frustrating because he has four very healthy siblings (only one cannot work because he is only 15) but my fianc\u00e9 has two other siblings who are 25, 21 and 18.  In those three years and up to the present, they have not helped at all and my mother-in-law still asks my fianc\u00e9 for money sporadically.  His older brother married a woman and they have 2 children from 2 to 3 years old, the second brother has a son whom he does not support and has been saying for more than 2 years that he will go to the US and the other sister earns money doing makeup, but she always it's just YOUR MONEY.  I understand your dilemma, I recommend you sit down and talk long and hard.  I did that, I showed him that he always had to give, but he has never received anything.  And I told him: \"When they leave and make their lives, when they finish the school that you pay for, what are you going to do? What are you going to get?\"", "NTA. You're fully justified in the way you feel, and it sounds like MIL and SIL probably are taking advantage of your husband. With that said, there are many cultures (mine included) in which it's obligatory for the younger generation to take care of the older generation.\n\nUltimately, you can't control whether or not your husband sends money to his family. What you can do though is do your best to be on the same side as him and try to understand how he feels about all this and be as supportive as possible. Maybe he also feels like he's being taken advantage of, but is scared of rejecting his cultural obligations, in which case it could be worth having him go to therapy to work it out. Or maybe he feels genuinely that he wants to continue doing this in which case you just have to learn to deal with it.", "Not the AH but if your husband doesn't realize for himself where his priorities and obligations lie and you have to bring it up more than once, then he would be.   Actually there's enough AH to go around for MiL and Sil as well.  Leave them to their own devices or to mooch off of some other kind family members.  They are not your (or your husband's) problem.", "NTA you need to tell him that he is wearing himself out to the point he might no longer be able to work. You need to point out he needs a cushion of money to see him through to his future. Instead he is giving his family fun money. They will not provide for him if his body fails. Look into trade school for a trade that is easier on the body. I've seen guys in their 40's pack in construction because their bodies cannot take it anymore.", "NAH, you\u2019re not wrong in that it seems like your husband is being taken advantage of by his family. However, you\u2019re not understanding that this is a common situation for Mexicans, especially Mexicans living in the US with family still back home. The American usually ends up supporting the people back home because wages are low and the men often take on this responsibility. Trying to force him to stop would both be unfair to him and it would go against cultural customs/obligations. It\u2019s a losing battle to make that choice for him.", "Husband should go to a trade school and pick up plumbing or electrical or car repair.", "There are times it is appropriate as a spouse to put your foot down. Effecting the financial stability of your household is most definitely one of those times.\n\nI realize you likely think the same, but the way you used \u201cordering\u201d makes it sound like she is being unreasonable, when I think most of us can agree she is not.", "YTA\n\nFor \u201cforbidding\u201d your husband \n\nHe\u2019s an adult.  He has a choice \n\nTry having a conversation with him as equals and ask him how he feels", "Nta\n\nWhen they come around maybe go back to your parents place for a bit so you don't have to deal with them when they are here at the least. You are in a tight spot though. I dont think he will stop giving money and working himself into the ground. Telling him he needs to consider this before his kid doesn't have a dad to see to their 21st is something he needs to consider", "NTA and I would consider therapy for your husband.", "yuck MILs and SILs like that are the worst.", "YTA It does sound like your husband's sister and mother are taking advantage of him but ultimately your husband is the one out there earning the money and he gets decide how to spend it. Imagine if your husband looked at what you were spending money on and said I forbid you from buying these items in the future.", "NTA - I grew up with a father who put his mom above his wife and kids. (Both parents from Mexico btw). So I get the culture thing but I'll also say if he doesn't get therapy and set boundaries, cut him out.

(I have like 10 to help keep me organized.)\n\nThen decide how much your going to put in each account. Then do it every single time money comes into your bank account. \n\nThen any money that is left over, gets put into 2 more savings account. These are marked her fun money and his fun money. \n\nAfter all of your savings accounts have been topped up, and everything is balanced so you dont have to worry about bills or groceries next month. You put leftover into fun money. \n\nThen your husband can send his lazy sister and mother money, but it can only come out of fun money. \n\nAny money that he takes from the other savings accounts to send to his lazy sister and mother, hell have to double the next month. \n\nWhen he complains, and he might. Remind him that his mother had no problem making herb9yr old work to support her, and actively laughing about it as if it was the greatest thing. His sister has no problem demanding money that she won't pay back. \n\nIf he wants to send money to his family, cool. Butbhe has to make sure that every single need it met before he can do that. He needs to make sure that you and the kids have money for emergencies, and vacations and fun Saturday family activities. All before he can send money to his family. \n\nIf he doesn't have the money, then own up to it and tell them no. \n\nHe might feel guilt, but tell him to get over it and focus on his family. His mother and sister are grown ass women who can take care of themselves. His sister chose to have kids so its her responsibility to provide for them, not his. If she didn't want to be a mother and pay for it, well then she shouldn't have had sex. \n\nRemind him that his mom laughed when her child was working to support her. She didn't care then and doesn't care now as long as she gets money. \n\nRemind him that his families needs come first. Not his mothers. She comes last. Screw culture, shes an adult and can take care of herself.", "I'm Mexican American. I think nta and I think you are right but your husband is almost certainly not going to stop. For immigrants it is expected that they send money back home especially if they have a widdowed mother, especially if they are men. \n\nThough women have typically done paid work inside the home, making food to sell, watching kids, taking in laundry etc the expectation is still that women don't work outside the home. Like it's not outrageous that a wife stay home even if there are no children yet. This can be diffrent depending on region and city v country side but where I'm from men have an obligation to be the financial provider, full stop. Now obviously that's complicated when there is no bf/husband. \n\nI agree that people should only send money home for emergencies or if the other person is unable to work not just if family back home is lazy but your husband is not going to see it that way. It is his responsibility to help them and he can't deny his mother financial help, she is his responsibility as much as you and the children are. \n\nMy step father is the same way. He has worked since he was like 6 and has a construction job. He finally stopped sending obscene amounts of money when his nephew asked him for money. He asked the nephew to go pick something up for him in town. The nephew didn't know he was going to pick up the money from someone that owed my step dad and refused. I remember he was so sad because \"I've got my son busting his ass in the sun lugging materials so that my nephew doesn't event have to walk for 20 minutes\". My brother and the nephew are only a year apart. \n\nMy advise is ask him, since you can no longer work is his money his or does it belong to both of you. Also ask him why he is ok paying for his mother/sister/nibling to have a better quality of life than your own family. You worked despite having children but that isn't good enough for his niblings? You need him to focus on your current family, not essentially steal from you and your children to give to people that won't work.", "NTA, please I want you to talk to him, ask him if he thinks you should ask your children to start working to support you? Ask him if he thinks it's okay for children to be around people who think it's right and that they will take advantage of them?, I live in Mexico and my grandmother worked to support several children, it was very difficult but she never did anything as selfish or ridiculous as refusing to work and expect her brother to support her, the stigma of being the main breadwinner in the house It is strong but you must remind your husband who the real family is, ask him what will happen if one of your children has an accident or needs surgery but they cannot pay for it because instead of saving he gives all the money to an ungrateful mother, or if the Children cannot spend time with their father or have those experiences that strengthen the father-son bond because either he is working or he is tired of working so much because it is more important to send money to a mother who takes pride of their negligence and abandonment than of their children in fact, I think that in the off my chest reddit sub, there was a post from a boy who grew up with an immigrant mother who constantly sent money to his family in his country of origin, money with which he could buy things that he he was always denied, so he didn't get the love of a caring mother and the benefit of all that hard work, maybe you should find that post and show it to him", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffe this. There's a cultural context combined with an immigrant context that probably means OP is fighting a losing battle. But \"forbid\" feels so controlling, OP needs to sit and discuss openly with her husband and they need to be transparent about how he's gonna handle the situation.\n\nNTA but you're in a complex situation OP. Best of luck.", "And set a low budget for giving money to those who won\u2019t work for it", "I understand the type of situation OP's husband is in. It does sound like the family is taking advantage.\n\nConsider, though, that in Mexico minimum wage is equivalent to $7 a *day*.\n\nThere is a reason why so many people are willing to come to the US and work, then send money back.  The cost of a cheap lunch here is enough to support someone there.  By comparison, it isn't much money he would need to be sending to look out for them, and is a societal expectation.  It is part of sharing the wealth of coming to the land of opportunity.\n\nWhile many here might insist that they would never choose to rely on their one brother who has become a medical doctor and is rich, the reality of dating sites and r/facepalm indicates there are many who absolutely would.\n\nI used to support a family in a different country for a little while because I became friends with the father, who came here to study English.  What they needed to live in was a lot less than what I made as a college student in a summer job.\n\nI dont think OP is an AH necessarily, but she is looking at things from the perspective of a multi-generational American (I'm guessing), whereas he is a first gen immigrant from a country where work is not necessarily available to those willing to work.  Many people have to work as children because you *pay* to attend public school directly, so poor families will have kids go to work.  Just like in our country 100-150 years ago, when big families were an added source of labor.\n\nFully fair or not, it would take a lot for someone to convince me to cut off my own mother from financial support if she needed it.  My sister? Thats borderline, but I wouldnt let my mom go hungry when I could easily help.", "Are you married? Once you're married, you decide how to spend your money together. It's not a \"he earns so he decides where the money goes\" scenario anymore. They have kids to think about. They have their future to think about. If OP is disabled and unable to provide financially, then what's the rest of their future going to look like? Who's paying for the kids' colleges? Forget college, will the SIL and MIL help these people financially if they were to fall on hardship and not be financially secure? OP didn't say anything for years, but when you see your husband being taken advantage of, combined with your own financial insecurity, what she did isn't wrong at all. Not saying she should go nuclear on him and give an ultimatum. But putting her foot down is absolutely justified.", "Yes he does. They are married and have kids together.
