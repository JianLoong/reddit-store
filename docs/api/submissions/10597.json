By LEECHING CALCIUM FROM THEIR MOTHER\u2019S BONES.\nMetal. \nYour wife\u2019s body had twins in it. Her bones had to move around and reorganize. Her organs had to shift to make room. Her lungs and heart and bladder had to work under increased pressure. She had to go through a labor and then delivery two whole babies and the associated bits and bobs.\n\nIf that were my wife\u2026bro I would never ask her to do anything ever again. Split your abdominal muscles in half and then decide if you feel like going to the gym ever again.\n\nThen get on Google and ask what you can do to support a partner who wants to get back in shape. You can meal prep, you can offer to take something off her hands, get her sessions to something fun and fitness-adjacent so she feels good. That way she knows you want her to feel good so she feels good, not so that you can pass judgement on her appearance.\n\nNot the most egregious, more of a dumb, but YTA", "YTA\n\nYou keep saying that you and she are open about things, but... being open and honest doesn't mean that she has no right to have feelings about what is being said. So I don't fully understand why you keep offering that as some sort of excuse? She has every right to feel whatever she wants to, no matter how open or closed off either of you are.\n\nObviously the weight gain is a touchy subject for her, and you remarking on it like that shows your lack of ability to *read the room* and be emotionally aware. Next time just tell her \"you are beautiful to me\" and leave it at that. And learn to be a bit more sensitive to her feelings.\n\nShe's been through multiple pregnancies -- they aren't always the exact same. It doesn't matter if she lost the weight the first time.

Your body aches, your allignment is messed up, she could have pelvic/back/bladder issues and your energy reserves are so much lower than they once were for obvious reasons.

There is NO okay way to point that out no matter how comfortable and jokey you are with each other. Also SHE FUCKING KNOWS. She is extremely aware of the changes her body has been through! What do think you saying \u201cwell, you haven\u2019t lost the baby weight yet\u201d is going to do? Is she going to go \u201coh my god, you\u2019re right! I totally forgot about carrying twins for nine months and then expelling them from my body. Thank you for reminding me! The jeans not fitting and the two babies at home was not enough of a reminder! You\u2019ve solved the puzzle, my brilliant husband, I will feel fine about things from now on!\u201d\n\nLook, you seem like you mean well. But this is not an area you get to comment on.

It\u2019s going to be changing she\u2019s also older so things are changing due to that. She wants to complain and just be listened to, she didn\u2019t want you to get into why her body changed and how she just wanted you to listen because I\u2019m sure she\u2019s well aware her body and weight are different, it\u2019s a hard topic for a lot of people especially moms no matter how far out they are from having a kid, moms bodies change so much from pregnancy and it can be hard for some women to adjust to.

Then shut it. YTA. \n\nAnd stop saying 'yet'. It's like you think her priority right now should be getting back to her prepregnancy weight instead of, oh, I don't know, taking care of your 7yo and 2yo twins?", "YTA for not thinking about how your comment might be perceived, because that's what this is about.", "YTA, don\u2019t have to go beyond the title.

She already knows she still has her baby weight and didn't need you to point it out.  She was just verbalizing her frustration.  Also, one baby/toddler is exhausting, let alone two at once.

She is just trying to get by day to day right now.", "YTA. It\u2019s the \u201cyet\u201d that really cinches it. She will probably never lose a good amount of that weight. And it was to carry your freaking children. Men like you are so disgusting.

She\u2019s older and twin pregnancies are more taxing on the body. You shouldn\u2019t expect any pregnancies or recoveries to be the same.

Even if she loses some or all of the weight (when she doesn\u2019t have 2 toddlers and maybe has time and energy to exercise again), her body has been changed because of what it\u2019s been put through and because every woman\u2019s body changes (shape even if weight stays consistent) over time. She\u2019s young and she may be struggling to accept that, the last thing she needs is worry that maybe you see her differently too. \nThe second you used words like \u201cstill\u201d and \u201cyet\u201d (you still have the baby weight, you haven\u2019t lost the weight yet) you gave her the impression that you expect her to get back to her 23 year old body at some point, an expectation that she hasn\u2019t met yet (and may never meet).\n\nIt\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter how fast or how hard you backpedal, you ain\u2019t putting that genie back in the bottle. Honestly I don\u2019t know how you go about fixing this. I get you didn\u2019t mean to hurt her but she was obviously feeling down on herself and you didn\u2019t help at all. You crapped the bed on this one so YTA.\n\nFor other men in M/F relationships: the correct answer would have been something along the lines of \u201cnuts to those jeans, you\u2019re absolutely gorgeous and we can just get you new jeans that show off the beautiful body you have now\u201d.", "YTA\n\nYou keep impyling that she should should reduce this weight like seriously? \n\nShe already feels sensitive about this let alone the fact that carrying not one but two babies takes a toll on the mother both physically but also mentally\n\nIf she doesn't loose weight then what?

Regardless of the fixing, her feelings were hurt even though it was unintentional. It happens. You were stating facts of pants don't fit if the body isnt the right size. Maybe she was just hitting that realization of \"I'm still gaining weight,  I need new pants, I have a ton of children, I do xyz everyday, it's easier to buy new pants then find the time or energy to lose the weight...\" I can go on and on. \n\nI think this is a good time to just sit with her and just tell her, you are sorry that you hurt her feelings and have a conversation about it.

WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU?", "Yeah YTA big time. She knows she still has the baby weight, she doesn\u2019t need you to explain why they don\u2019t fit. Maybe if you had to endure your body being forever changed by growing babies you would understand why she reacted that way.", "YTA. She may also have diastasis recti from a twin pregnancy. All the twin moms I know have it. Without surgery to fix those muscles, she will always have trouble fitting into clothing the way she likes. The surgery is expensive and is not covered by insurance in the US so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s an added layer of indignity to the whole situation.\n\nI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean to be malicious or cruel, but she heard differently. She\u2019s vulnerable and obviously embarrassed by the situation. Apologize for the clumsy way you spoke and remind her that you love her and then ask her what she needs from you so she can focus on her health.", "YTA, but you know that already. What you need to do is take her into your arms and tell you you love her more than life itself. You love every inch of her, every curve of her body, but that you know having children has been tough on her mentally and physically. Then ask her, \u201cwhat do you need from me? How can I help you? Maybe she needs to sign up for a gym and go super early before the kids wake up. Maybe she wants to buy an elliptical for the garage or spare room so she can work out at home. Maybe she wants to meet with a nutritionist. Maybe she just wants a new wardrobe. Let her tell you what she needs and you just support her and try to make it happen.", "YTA.  I had the reverse issue, personally.  I had my twins first when I was 19 and somehow managed to leave the hospital wearing the same size pants I had pre pregnancy (God knows how, I got huge!) But when I had my last child (3rd pregnancy) I couldn't lose the weight at all!  It took me deploying to AFG  to slim back down and it was for all the wrong reasons!  She's stressed and tired and prolly losing her mind with twin 2 yr olds (those were dark days....) And needs more reminders of her mom superpowers and support vs reminders of how her body will never be what it was pre baby.", "Your context and framing is probably gonna get you a lot of Asshole votes tbh but I vote NTA.

From what you\u2019ve said it sounds like it might be bothering her though. Maybe tell her you\u2019d like to get fit and ask her to be your gym partner. Losing weight isn\u2019t the easiest thing to go through mentally especially being a mom of three, maybe reaching health goals together is a way to go.", "NTA. You are probably going to be called the asshole by a lot of women here, however, as weight gain seems to be the taboo thing to ever mention.  \n\n\nHowever a 50% weight gain is a lot. If she was trying to exercise, or maintain a healthy diet that might be one thing but as you said, she isnt.  (Exercise by the way doesnt tend to help with weight gain, its just for bodily health. Weight gain is about caloric intake as im sure you know)  \n\n\nYou didn't say anything as an insult, or mean to be cruel or demeaning. She stated she cant fit in her jeans. You pointed out she has gained and hasnt lost any weight. Its a fact. Sounds like the two of you need to sit down and have a conversation.", "NTA but definitely need to work on phrasing\n\n\nShe's carrying Baby weight..from you're child\n\nNot that it matters but each time baby weight gets added it can be harder to get rid..along with the fact she now has Three kids and is older.\n\nEven if it was good intentioned it was not done well. Think about it from her perspective and it could come off as you saying she's fat/ugly\n\nI doubt you intended it to come off that way.\n\nI dont think YTA intentionally but kinds TA for not wording it better", "NTA.

Two of those at the same time nonetheless.", "YTA  \n\n\nI'd maybe buy the 'I love her and don't care about/judge the weight gain' type claim if you hadn't made comparisons to how she lost the baby weight quickly after your first (therefore very much implying she *should* have lost it as quickly this time).  \n\n\nPregnancy and childbirth takes a MASSIVE toll on a woman's body, and not every woman or pregnancy is the same.  The fact she's older now, had TWINS this time (seriously, she carried TWINS), is already looking after an older child so has less time and energy, has toddler TWINS (did I mention she has twins!?) means she has even less time and energy, and had already been through one pregnancy before all mean it will be much harder to lose weight this time.  \n\n\nLook at a balloon before it's been blown up.  It's all in shape and smooth without any saggy bits or lumpy bits right?  Blow it up a little and then let it deflate again.  It doesn't go back to the same shape, does it?  Now blow it up even further a second time and see how it's even less like it's original shape!  It's not exactly difficult to understand.  \n\n\nAnd that's just the physical aspect.  It's so hard being a mum and losing your identity as a human being in your own right.  Your wife will be going through a tough time trying to reconcile who she used to be with who she is now.  All she wanted from you was reassurance that to you she's still the same person.  Instead, you basically told her she's not trying hard enough/is lazy, and is fat.  \n\n\nAnd in what way did you think pointing it out was helpful?  Do you genuinely think she had no idea why her jeans no longer fit??  Did you think she was going to be grateful to you that you solved this impossible mystery for her?

Plus a first pregnancy.) she bounced back! She wrangling young children with basically zero time for self care and you think she has time to prioritize the gym?", "YTA. This is how relationships work. Your wife has experienced major and probably permanent changes to her body as a result of having children. That's not going to suddenly be rectified by a few visits to the gym. Even if it was possible or even desirable to attend the gym when you have three young kids to look after.\n\nOn the other hand, her acting confused by sizing up jeans as a result is frustrating bait. You are 100% technically correct that the baby weight is the reason the jeans magically now don't fit. But you can't ever say that. Even when it's supremely annoying that your wife will act like goblins came in one day and deposited smaller jeans than she expected in your house. There is never a situation where your wife will take that information well, and there's no point trying to explain how much goodwill you have when you say \"but you're actually fatter than before\". \n\nRecognise that your wife is probably saying this to hint that she's feeling unattractive about her appearance and needs support from you. She deserves it. Don't go on about her weight, take her shopping for new jeans that consent to fit properly.

It\u2019s just part of the journey. \n\nAnd yes, OP YTA.", "It takes an average of 10 year for a woman to recover, both mentally and physically, from having twins. OP had absolutely zero empathy for the havoc that a twin pregnancy wreaks upon a woman\u2019s body, let alone the stresses of raising three young kids. If you\u2019re that concerned about her weight, which tbh is kind of effed up, then take the kids for a couple of hours a day so she can have the mental and physical space to focus on her health. You can also plan out healthy meals and do the food shopping while you\u2019re at it. Unless looking after twins and a 7 year old while doing other tasks feels a little overwhelming to you, despite the face that you haven\u2019t had a major, life-altering physical and mental change to your body in the last couple of years, OP?\n\nYTA", "He knows what she weighs, which probably means she told him. He knows she's sizing up jeans, probably because she told him. Yet he thinks he needs to inform her that she hasn't lost weight since having the babies. Now he's acting like he's baffled that she took it in a negative way. \n\nOP, did you really believe you were informing her of her pregnancy weight gain and its impact on her clothing size? If you were being honest with yourself, really honest, would you say this was perhaps a passive-aggressive dig to \"remind\" her that she should lose the weight?", "As a dumb man I was struggling to see what he did wrong - he never asked her to lose weight, he was just answering her question. Your first paragraph puts it in context. Don\u2019t say the quiet part out loud.", "It can be often fixed with PT too. Even some extreme cases have been fixed with PT", "Right???. And they could have fit and then washed and shrunk so she could have been wondering about this specific pair at this time. Especially if they're new. I'm mad for her ugh", "I gained back the weight I lost so my spring/summer clothes from last year aren't going to fit and I'm sad about that. I know exactly why they don't fit and yet when I try something on and it's tight I still think to myself, \"Ugh why this JUST fit me!\" Because it sucks and it's frustrating to have clothes you want to wear and can't.", ">She was very small to start with and is still a normal weight\n\nUnless she's at least a couple inches over average height, she qualifies as obese now...\n\nOP's an asshole, but that's not normal", "I appreciate you pointing out \"yet.\" I couldn't get over it, it's such a loaded word in this context.", "Absolutely. Read the title, and immediately thought \u2018yyyyyyeeep! YTA\u2019.", "Stress is such a huge thing, especially for women. Didn't realize how bad the stress at my last job had gotten, despite trying to squeeze in working out and eating arguably better than I had in my life. New job, less stress, in a month I dropped 15 lbs and a full pant size. I changed nothing but the stressful job. \n\nAnd 2 y/o twins, the woman is a saint as far as I'm concerned. Stay at home parentage is rough (shout out to all y'all who do it!) and with two tiny gremlins seems like undoable as a parent of a singleton.", "Sorry, was OP the one to wonder why his wife\u2019s jeans didn\u2019t fit? It was it the wife who already knew why bringing it up and demanding answers? So confusing, all these words forming sentences.", "Yep. I know someone who has dry eye caused by pregnancy and she can't wear contacts anymore.", "I was doing a great job of losing weight until my dad had a heart attack and then all my energy and focus went into helping him recover and take care of our house so I gained all the weight back. I'm really disappointed and struggling to try again but I know exactly why it happened and that's just life. I had the perfect storm of determination and motivation and no stress when I started losing weight but as soon as something messed that up, it was over.", "You can be stupid and thoughtless and still be TA.", "I have two year old twins. It\u2019s a lot. I love them to pieces but at the end of the day I don\u2019t have the energy to read let alone go to a gym.", "I nanny a three year old and a 16 month old, and (obviously with parent approval) I DONT GET TO PEE ALONE EITHER. One time the three year old burst through the door in the middle of a tampon change, which was... Ugh. I apologize to my parents constantly now. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAlso, OP YTA. Consider how your wife feels about her body and why she might avoid the \"ah it's because I'm heavier\" realization. Pregnancy alone is hard and scary, but so is the reality of how it permanently changes her body, life, and metabolism.", "Yep. Been there and made that same call to my own mother.", "I remember days when both the toddler and the cat were yelling at the toilet door", "In addition to the actual time to go to gym she would also need the energy. Little kids can be physically and emotionally exhausting. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help if OP is the type to \u201cbabysit\u201d his children and leave more work for when she returns home.", "i wonder how much this man weighs", "When my daughter was a baby I volunteered at a gym creche and got a free membership. Never used it to work out, just to take an uninterrupted shower and spend half an hour doing my hair", "This comment is so beautiful! I hope I marry someone with this same attitude.", "Amen! Fuck vanity sizing, give me something I can actually work with!", "THIS. THIS. THIS. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Yeah the three year mark is when I finally started feeling recovered from childbirth. Granted I have EDS, so my joints, muscles, and tendons were extra damaged, but it takes a long fucking time to recover from childbirth. The six weeks thing is the minimum for wounds to have closed so you don't get an infection from sex.", "Jesus Murphy,  thank you. I thought the pitchforks were about to come out for the poor bastard. Who is still TAH, but probably not that bad a guy.", "Yes I think people overlook how much stress can affect your weight and health overall. There was a period where I was incredibly anxious and depressed and also overweight. I was killing my self trying to lose weight, meal prepping, intermittent fasting, going to the gym 5 days a week, had an active job, etc. I couldn\u2019t lose more than a few pounds and I would always gain it back. I got on a different form of birth control and got my mental health in a better place and that weight dropped off immediately. For some people exercising is stress relief and that\u2019s awesome, it\u2019s not for me. So it was just another added stressor at that time and another way I felt like I was failing.", "I have 2 pairs of size 2 skinny  jeans. Exact same brand. Exact same cut. Only difference on paper is the wash. The dark wash is a struggle to put on and tries to cut me in half when zipped while the light wash fits like a dream. I made the mistake of ordering a second pair online after finding what I thought was the perfect fit in store... sigh.", "I'm sure the husband thinks of it as babysitting when watching his own children but it's not.  It's called being a parent.  Shared responsibility.  My sister lets her husband get away with this while he golfs all the time.  I've learned to keep my mouth shut about it though.", "My husband is a gem of a human and always words his responses like this. The other day I felt so much shame over the size I had to get my underwear online and he grabbed my phone, put his card info in and went ahead and ordered 4 pairs. He knew I didn\u2019t have the self love in me to just get a bigger size.", "My two year old cries unless he is sitting on my lap WHILE I PEE. He cries again while I wipe and wash my hands. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I would do if I had two of him.", "Yeah, tell that to the huge number of men who think watching their own kids is doing their wife a favor.", "Goes to find op comments.", "Your kids knock? My seven-year-old still just bursts in and starts talking", "a friend once said -- while her eldest kid was 6 and the others were both 2 -- that her 2 biggest wishes for a vacation were to go to the bathroom by herself and to sleep in to 6:30. Dream big, I said. She said that was dreaming big.", "My 1yr old daughter has started climbing on to my lap whether I like it or not, she has even tried to get between her dads legs while he was peeing (thank god I was able to race in and grab her). \n\nOP is definitely YTA on this. I can't even find time to do a step class on our Nintendo Wii, let alone go to the gym 4 days a week. I started buying elastic band jeans from kmart just so I didn't notice my weight every time I put them on, and they are so comfy. \n\nOP needs to pull his head out of his butt with that \"yet\" comment, though. Otherwise, I wouldn't blame his wife if she decides to lose a lot of dead weight real fast (aka, leave him). \n\nEvery time I complain about my weight, my hubby just shuts me up with a kiss and feels me up and says, \"Hmmm, you don't feel different,\" with his cheeky smirk plastered across his face, it's definitely alot more affective than how OP handled it.", "Yeah in my relationship, the agreement is my partner DOES comment on my weight gain (positively). Because I had ED issues related to my size and now I want to gain weight and being told I still had baby weight cutely would be kind in my relationship. \n\nThe YET and haven't LOST would be the fucking deal breaker. Also one of us would probably idk mention the kids \"yeah you've kept the baby weight and gained muscle from carrying two toddlers all day! Of course you need new pants if you're a big strong mama bear!\" something like that.\n\nBut obviously also OPs wife ISN'T the kind to think weight is a compliment. Which he should know after 3 kids. Fucking yikes.", "Why do you guys just make up background on these posts and make a judgement based off your assumptions?", "They\u2019re afraid you\u2019re going to sneak out the hidden door in the bathroom"]}
