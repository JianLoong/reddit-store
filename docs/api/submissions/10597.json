By LEECHING CALCIUM FROM THEIR MOTHER\u2019S BONES.\nMetal. \nYour wife\u2019s body had twins in it. Her bones had to move around and reorganize. Her organs had to shift to make room. Her lungs and heart and bladder had to work under increased pressure. She had to go through a labor and then delivery two whole babies and the associated bits and bobs.\n\nIf that were my wife\u2026bro I would never ask her to do anything ever again. Split your abdominal muscles in half and then decide if you feel like going to the gym ever again.\n\nThen get on Google and ask what you can do to support a partner who wants to get back in shape. You can meal prep, you can offer to take something off her hands, get her sessions to something fun and fitness-adjacent so she feels good. That way she knows you want her to feel good so she feels good, not so that you can pass judgement on her appearance.\n\nNot the most egregious, more of a dumb, but YTA", "YTA\n\nYou keep saying that you and she are open about things, but... being open and honest doesn't mean that she has no right to have feelings about what is being said. So I don't fully understand why you keep offering that as some sort of excuse? She has every right to feel whatever she wants to, no matter how open or closed off either of you are.\n\nObviously the weight gain is a touchy subject for her, and you remarking on it like that shows your lack of ability to *read the room* and be emotionally aware. Next time just tell her \"you are beautiful to me\" and leave it at that. And learn to be a bit more sensitive to her feelings.\n\nShe's been through multiple pregnancies -- they aren't always the exact same. It doesn't matter if she lost the weight the first time.

I can take over on Saturdays and some evenings during the week. I can take over dinner duties on such and such days' etc. etc.\n\nWhat you basically said was 'yeah you're still fat since the babies'.\n\nShe's carried 3 children...a twin pregnancy takes a huge toll. Your body aches, your allignment is messed up, she could have pelvic/back/bladder issues and your energy reserves are so much lower than they once were for obvious reasons.  Did she need your reminder? Highly doubt it. Do you think she's brain damaged? If not, then there's a huge likelihood she already knows why her jeans don't fit.", "YTA. There is NO okay way to point that out no matter how comfortable and jokey you are with each other. Also SHE FUCKING KNOWS. She is extremely aware of the changes her body has been through! What do think you saying \u201cwell, you haven\u2019t lost the baby weight yet\u201d is going to do? Is she going to go \u201coh my god, you\u2019re right! I totally forgot about carrying twins for nine months and then expelling them from my body. Thank you for reminding me! The jeans not fitting and the two babies at home was not enough of a reminder! You\u2019ve solved the puzzle, my brilliant husband, I will feel fine about things from now on!\u201d\n\nLook, you seem like you mean well. But this is not an area you get to comment on.

You are beautiful and you should go buy some new clothes that make you feel beautiful and comfortable.\u201d", "I think most of the comments have it covered as to why YTA but I want to add, often second pregnancies hit the body different, especially when carrying multiples AND her body will carry weight differently. It\u2019s going to be changing she\u2019s also older so things are changing due to that. She wants to complain and just be listened to, she didn\u2019t want you to get into why her body changed and how she just wanted you to listen because I\u2019m sure she\u2019s well aware her body and weight are different, it\u2019s a hard topic for a lot of people especially moms no matter how far out they are from having a kid, moms bodies change so much from pregnancy and it can be hard for some women to adjust to. Next time just listen and be empathetic.\n\nAlso who the eff has time to go to the gym that much with all those kids?", "This guy (1) expects his wife's body to be the same after multiple children and (2) expects her to be in the gym multiple times a week while raising the kids. \n\nYou're not just being an asshole, you're an ignorant person who never really thinks about his wife as a human being or what she's going through.", "Do *you* shed weight as easily now as you did in your early 20s?

Then shut it. YTA. \n\nAnd stop saying 'yet'. It's like you think her priority right now should be getting back to her prepregnancy weight instead of, oh, I don't know, taking care of your 7yo and 2yo twins?", "YTA for not thinking about how your comment might be perceived, because that's what this is about.", "YTA, don\u2019t have to go beyond the title.

She already knows she still has her baby weight and didn't need you to point it out.  She was just verbalizing her frustration.  Also, one baby/toddler is exhausting, let alone two at once.

She is just trying to get by day to day right now.", "YTA. It\u2019s the \u201cyet\u201d that really cinches it. She will probably never lose a good amount of that weight. And it was to carry your freaking children. Men like you are so disgusting.

Hire a housekeeper, a nanny, a household manager, a personal chef, and a personal trainer - and make sure she only has to work part-time hours.

She\u2019s older and twin pregnancies are more taxing on the body. You shouldn\u2019t expect any pregnancies or recoveries to be the same.

Even if she loses some or all of the weight (when she doesn\u2019t have 2 toddlers and maybe has time and energy to exercise again), her body has been changed because of what it\u2019s been put through and because every woman\u2019s body changes (shape even if weight stays consistent) over time. She\u2019s young and she may be struggling to accept that, the last thing she needs is worry that maybe you see her differently too. \nThe second you used words like \u201cstill\u201d and \u201cyet\u201d (you still have the baby weight, you haven\u2019t lost the weight yet) you gave her the impression that you expect her to get back to her 23 year old body at some point, an expectation that she hasn\u2019t met yet (and may never meet).\n\nIt\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter how fast or how hard you backpedal, you ain\u2019t putting that genie back in the bottle. Honestly I don\u2019t know how you go about fixing this. I get you didn\u2019t mean to hurt her but she was obviously feeling down on herself and you didn\u2019t help at all. You crapped the bed on this one so YTA.\n\nFor other men in M/F relationships: the correct answer would have been something along the lines of \u201cnuts to those jeans, you\u2019re absolutely gorgeous and we can just get you new jeans that show off the beautiful body you have now\u201d.", "YTA\n\nYou keep impyling that she should should reduce this weight like seriously? \n\nShe already feels sensitive about this let alone the fact that carrying not one but two babies takes a toll on the mother both physically but also mentally\n\nIf she doesn't loose weight then what?

Regardless of the fixing, her feelings were hurt even though it was unintentional. It happens. You were stating facts of pants don't fit if the body isnt the right size. Maybe she was just hitting that realization of \"I'm still gaining weight,  I need new pants, I have a ton of children, I do xyz everyday, it's easier to buy new pants then find the time or energy to lose the weight...\" I can go on and on. \n\nI think this is a good time to just sit with her and just tell her, you are sorry that you hurt her feelings and have a conversation about it.

WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU?", "Yeah YTA big time. She knows she still has the baby weight, she doesn\u2019t need you to explain why they don\u2019t fit. Maybe if you had to endure your body being forever changed by growing babies you would understand why she reacted that way.", "YTA. She may also have diastasis recti from a twin pregnancy. All the twin moms I know have it. Without surgery to fix those muscles, she will always have trouble fitting into clothing the way she likes. The surgery is expensive and is not covered by insurance in the US so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s an added layer of indignity to the whole situation.\n\nI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean to be malicious or cruel, but she heard differently. She\u2019s vulnerable and obviously embarrassed by the situation. Apologize for the clumsy way you spoke and remind her that you love her and then ask her what she needs from you so she can focus on her health.", "YTA, but you know that already. What you need to do is take her into your arms and tell you you love her more than life itself. You love every inch of her, every curve of her body, but that you know having children has been tough on her mentally and physically. Then ask her, \u201cwhat do you need from me? How can I help you? Maybe she needs to sign up for a gym and go super early before the kids wake up. Maybe she wants to buy an elliptical for the garage or spare room so she can work out at home. Maybe she wants to meet with a nutritionist. Maybe she just wants a new wardrobe. Let her tell you what she needs and you just support her and try to make it happen.", "YTA.  I had the reverse issue, personally.  I had my twins first when I was 19 and somehow managed to leave the hospital wearing the same size pants I had pre pregnancy (God knows how, I got huge!) But when I had my last child (3rd pregnancy) I couldn't lose the weight at all!  It took me deploying to AFG  to slim back down and it was for all the wrong reasons!

From what you\u2019ve said it sounds like it might be bothering her though. Maybe tell her you\u2019d like to get fit and ask her to be your gym partner. Losing weight isn\u2019t the easiest thing to go through mentally especially being a mom of three, maybe reaching health goals together is a way to go.", "NTA. You are probably going to be called the asshole by a lot of women here, however, as weight gain seems to be the taboo thing to ever mention.  \n\n\nHowever a 50% weight gain is a lot. If she was trying to exercise, or maintain a healthy diet that might be one thing but as you said, she isnt.  (Exercise by the way doesnt tend to help with weight gain, its just for bodily health. Weight gain is about caloric intake as im sure you know)  \n\n\nYou didn't say anything as an insult, or mean to be cruel or demeaning. She stated she cant fit in her jeans. You pointed out she has gained and hasnt lost any weight. Its a fact. Sounds like the two of you need to sit down and have a conversation.", "NTA but definitely need to work on phrasing\n\n\nShe's carrying Baby weight..from you're child\n\nNot that it matters but each time baby weight gets added it can be harder to get rid..along with the fact she now has Three kids and is older.\n\nEven if it was good intentioned it was not done well. Think about it from her perspective and it could come off as you saying she's fat/ugly\n\nI doubt you intended it to come off that way.\n\nI dont think YTA intentionally but kinds TA for not wording it better", "NTA.

Two of those at the same time nonetheless.", "YTA  \n\n\nI'd maybe buy the 'I love her and don't care about/judge the weight gain' type claim if you hadn't made comparisons to how she lost the baby weight quickly after your first (therefore very much implying she *should* have lost it as quickly this time).  \n\n\nPregnancy and childbirth takes a MASSIVE toll on a woman's body, and not every woman or pregnancy is the same.  The fact she's older now, had TWINS this time (seriously, she carried TWINS), is already looking after an older child so has less time and energy, has toddler TWINS (did I mention she has twins!?) means she has even less time and energy, and had already been through one pregnancy before all mean it will be much harder to lose weight this time.  \n\n\nLook at a balloon before it's been blown up.  It's all in shape and smooth without any saggy bits or lumpy bits right?  Blow it up a little and then let it deflate again.  It doesn't go back to the same shape, does it?  Now blow it up even further a second time and see how it's even less like it's original shape!  It's not exactly difficult to understand.  \n\n\nAnd that's just the physical aspect.  It's so hard being a mum and losing your identity as a human being in your own right.  Your wife will be going through a tough time trying to reconcile who she used to be with who she is now.  All she wanted from you was reassurance that to you she's still the same person.  Instead, you basically told her she's not trying hard enough/is lazy, and is fat.  \n\n\nAnd in what way did you think pointing it out was helpful?  Do you genuinely think she had no idea why her jeans no longer fit??  Did you think she was going to be grateful to you that you solved this impossible mystery for her?

It doesn\u2019t matter if you say you still find her attractive you just shamed a part of her body that is only that way because she had kids.

Plus a first pregnancy.) she bounced back! She wrangling young children with basically zero time for self care and you think she has time to prioritize the gym?", "YTA. This is how relationships work. Your wife has experienced major and probably permanent changes to her body as a result of having children. That's not going to suddenly be rectified by a few visits to the gym. Even if it was possible or even desirable to attend the gym when you have three young kids to look after.\n\nOn the other hand, her acting confused by sizing up jeans as a result is frustrating bait. You are 100% technically correct that the baby weight is the reason the jeans magically now don't fit. But you can't ever say that. Even when it's supremely annoying that your wife will act like goblins came in one day and deposited smaller jeans than she expected in your house. There is never a situation where your wife will take that information well, and there's no point trying to explain how much goodwill you have when you say \"but you're actually fatter than before\". \n\nRecognise that your wife is probably saying this to hint that she's feeling unattractive about her appearance and needs support from you. She deserves it. Don't go on about her weight, take her shopping for new jeans that consent to fit properly.

Have some common sense dude.", "YTA, and insensitive. That being said, do you go to the gym with a 7 year old and 2 year old twins? And if so, who is taking care of the kids while you are there? Could it be your wife?", "Yta. Her body is currently like that because it's proof that it has worked hard for YOUR family. Come on, guy. Be a the family man your wife deserves.", "So what did you intend to do? Honestly, what was the outcome you expected to telling your wife that she \"hasn't lost the baby weight yet\" after she's brought three of YOUR children into the World? YTA.", "I mean I really don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t know your the AH \n\nJust to make it clear YTA \n\nTwins at the age of two. Do you for one second really think she has enough time and energy to go to the gym? This is laughable.", "She has an attitude with you? I'm not surprised!  YTA", "YTA having small children, let alone twins, is exhausting.\n\nDo you give her time that she could go to the gym? Or do anything for herself?", "YTA obviously", "YTA", "Wow. Did you really just ask this..\n\nYes YTA.", "YTA. All the little info you gave us about her not trying to lose the weight and not going to the gym, you probs said/hinted more than just pointing out her baby weight.   'we're open with each other\". Sometimes a woman just wants you to shut up and let her complain. She's also probably too tired to focus on herself with 3 children.", "YTA", "Is what you are going to say necessary, kind or true? Get it through at least two of those gates before speaking.", "YTA. Can she immediately lose weight? No? Then don\u2019t mention it. The rule of thumb is, if they can\u2019t do something about in that minute then don\u2019t say anything.\n\nAlso, look up what happens to the body during pregnancy and birth. Especially with twins. And then take stock of how her time management has had to change going from 1 child to 3, I\u2019d imagine she\u2019s lost a lot of time to look after her own needs. This is an opportunity to make yourself aware of the true emotional and physical burden women take on.", "I don\u2019t think I read the same post as all the people saying YTA here. As long as you said this ONLY with the intention of being information as to why the pants don\u2019t fit youre not the a hole here. The second you shame her for not loosing the weigth, make comments in general, or expect her to loose it, you are the a hole.\n\nNTA", "Ngl like going from 120 to 180 is A LOT. You could just encourage her to workout with you", "With what my single pregnancies did to my body, I can't even imagine", "Seriously this. Why not offer to take her shopping for some  new  jeans so she can feel good about herself, instead of feeling the judgement of the old ones that you have reinforced?\n\nEdit to add YTA", "You make it work.

But now the gym is called \u00abAt home chasing toddlers\u00bb.", "He is not saying she should or complaining about it. This is information only.", "I wonder how often OP looks after the kids so she can even go to the gym.", "Losing weight requires a certain mindset and if you're busy, stressed and exhausted all the time - its not going to cultivate that mindset. \n\nI've only been able to do it now because I haven't been in hospital for 5 months straight (woo!).\n\nYou've got to think about food, plan meals, weigh ingredients, find time to shop properly and with a plan. Exercise consistently.  When you're exhausted, you do what is quickest and easiest.", "Well said. Maybe she doesn't have time to go to the gym anymore with 3 kids. Maybe you could do a little extra to help her out.", "So true... I had my 2nd kid (not even twins) eight monthes ago and could not loose ANY weight this far. I'm breastfeeding, quite active and I'm not eating more than before. My body just does not want to lose any baby weight at the moment. Very frustrating.\nFor my first kid I had no problem.", "I would think that too, except OP keeps saying she hasn't lost the weight 'yet', she doesn't go to the gym like she used to, she gained so much less weight with the first pregnancy in her early 20s and lost it all so quick, she doesn't get why her pants don't fit, ect. She knows why her pants don't fit. The 2 bundles of joy she is taking care of instead of going to the gym. OP spent about a 3rd of the post describing how his wife has gained weight.", "That's kinda what I think. I dont think it was intended for OP to have it come off that way but was not very thought out", "yup, this!", "I have multiple friends who have had twins and all of them have needed significant help to lose weight and shrink their bodies, including surgery to fix the strain put on various parts (abdominal muscles, hernias, skin removal, etc.) No one is dropping 60lbs with just 4 days a week in the gym, that is going to need a ton of diet and lifestyle changes/support that toddler twins don't permit. So if OP thinks his wife needed him to help a lot immediately post partum, he should buckle up to help 2x more now if they're going to be serious about losing the twin weight. Maybe take a second job to help with whatever surgical help is needed to fix those poor, poor abdominal muscles and get that pelvic floor rehabbed and help make meal planning, prep and gym time happen. Otherwise, she's still in survival mode and half her meals come off whatever is left when the kids are done eating. Not a super balanced diet...", "Where did he say he doesnt love her? Where does he say anything negative about her?    \n\n\nSome of these responses are just so out in left field.", "there\u2019s honest, and open and then there\u2019s cruel. saying \u201cyou haven\u2019t lost the baby weight yet\u201d is cruel as it implies she\u2019s expected to lose it. i can see how she would say he\u2019s calling her unattractive", "the weight gain is obviously from carrying twins.

She could go walking BY HERSELF.  She could, if she wanted to, go to the gym. \n\nExercise does help in burning calories.  I watch what I eat and keep track of what calories I burn.  I also have the time for this as our youngest is in their 20's.   When my children were small I didn't have the time to watch my diet.\n\nNo where does OP state that he, in anyway, helps with cooking, meal planning, or grocery shopping.  Instead of pointing out her weight gain, why not go for family walks.", "I agree", "You only have one step kid that moved in with you when they were a teen last year. How could you possibly believe you have the experience to tell a mother of three children (twins!) How to schedule their day and exercise schedule?", "Why? Seriously, why wrangle two 2yos, with all the things they need, and a 7yo, who has their own school schedule and homework to do, out to a gym, then pay extra to have someone watch them while you lift weights or jog on a treadmill? Then wrangle them all home, and still have to do the evening routine? That seems like a lot of work for a mom with young children.", "Not everywhere has a gym with a daycare. Or you know, the energy to go somewhere else. With children that age, you focus on getting through the day, not working out. \n\nAnd besides, her body is never going to be the same. Pregnancy can and will leave lifelong side effects.", "Wow", "Just because it\u2019s \u201cinformation only\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that you need to say it. Telling your wife she\u2019s still fat after carrying twins is never ever going to be taken well.

Like he's disappointed she's not working out as much despite having to take care of the 7yo and the 2yo twins.", "Yeah but this was in response to her complaining that her pants didn't fit anymore.", "He didn't state \"haven't lost the baby weight yet\". He said that it was baby weight. There was no implication that she was expected to lose it. He only stated a fact about where the weight came from.", "Of course its from the pregnancy weight. I dont think that has to be argued. Although its been 2 years, not 2 months.  \n\n\nHe didnt say she has to go to the gym 4 times a week, he said she used to.   \nIf she didnt want to open the window of the weight gain, she shouldnt have made comments about not fitting in her clothing.", "Nowhere does he state if he does, or doesnt. Nobodya skeed. So lets not assume anything here.  \n\n\nExercise isnt going to make her lose weight, its diet.   \nShe knows she put on weight, its been 2 years. She hasnt tried to do anything about it. As someone who has always struggled with my weight, I know when ive gained or lost. I dont get upset when loved ones mention a weight gain.
