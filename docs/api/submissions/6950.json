I told her that's fine, but be home by 10.\n\nAt about 945 I called to remind her that she needed to be home by 10. She said their pizza had just gotten to them and she would be home in a few minutes.\n\n10:00 hits and she isn't home so by now I am pretty frustrated and admittedly I did lose my temper a bit, but her mom knows when I say 10 I mean 10. Not 10:05, not 10:02.\n\nSo I called Lily and said \"Where the fuck are you at? It's 10 and I told you to be home!\" She said \"our pizza came late and mom asked if I could drop her and Nikki (mom's friend) off at home because they had a couple drinks during dinner.\"\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck, you aren't your mom's DD. Now get your ass home.\"\n\nWell unknown to me, her mom and friend were just getting out of the car and I was on bluetooth so they heard me yelling at Lily.\n\nI don't really care, because they already think I'm an AH, but at my house, rules are to be followed. Their mom thinks she can be their friend but that doesn't fly with me.\n\nWhen Lily got home (10:12), I took her keys and told her to tell her mom she will have to pick the girls up for their time at her house. Now I'm even more of an AH apparently, because she will have to take them back and forth to school instead of them being able to drive. I say that's too bad, she shouldn't have kept my daughter out past when I told her to be home. \n\nThe agreement was that I would buy Lily a car and she would buy Hannah a car when she's old enough, so I own the car. \n\nI think I might be the AH because maybe I shouldn't have yelled at her quite so bad, but what am I supposed to do, just have no rules and let them do whatever they want?", "created_utc": 1673316205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107xe1c/aita_for_taking_away_my_daughters_car/", "score": 448, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which I wouldn't blame them one bit.\nYTA", "YTA - Why do people think parenting is yelling? You knew where your kid was, she was safe, and supervised. \n\nBut lets be honest, you were mad because your daughter was having a good time with your ex", "YTA. \n\nHere are the lessons you taught your daughter: \n\n1. Don't communicate with you when something isn't going as planned. \n\n2. You are not safe to make angry, so better to lie. \n\n3. If she is going to be late, better to ignore the call and just get yelled at at home, rather than on the phone and then again when she got home.\n\nShe was with her custodial parent, making the RIGHT choice to help people who had been drinking too much.

What was she supposed to do, ditch her MOTHER?  Seriously, what were you thinking would happen?  Give her back her car and APOLOGIZE.", "YTA.  She was 12 minutes late.  That is a little over the top.  Is this the hill that you want to die on?\n\n12 minutes late does not equal \"no rules\" and \"let them do whatever they want\".", "YTA, and you\u2019re not likely to have 50/50 custody for much longer.

Text me when you're leaving. \n\nNo wonder you're divorced. Take a parenting class, dude. You really need one. And stop screaming at your daughter.", "YTA Twelve minutes late? That's trivial.", "YTA, the person you are really upset with is your ex. You are taking it out on your daughter who is caught in the middle.", "YTA.  Not so much for taking away the car, although as the parent of a teen and having an ex-spouse of my own, I would offer a LITTLE grace when her mother is egging on the behavior your find objectionable.  That  alone does not squarely put you in AH territory.  Yelling at her in that way does.  You do need to be a parent and not a friend, but you *also need her to be able to talk freely to you about tough things and trust you to problem-solve collaboratively.*  This was in every way the opposite of that.  Instead of acknowledging that her mother had a role in these shenanigans and work on how to overcome that, knowing her skills are still developing here, you dumped all of your anger on your daughter when she wasn't the sole cause of it.\n\nEdited to finish the last clause.", "YTA and so is your Ex...  \n\nYou are screaming at a literal child. You are wrong. Very wrong. And as an adult it's in you to do better. Whatever is wrong with you, you need to fix. You are screaming at a child for what a parent asks of them. Literally screaming and cursing. Like a complete looney toon. \n\nYour ex is an AH for making a literal child a DD... Like what? No. That's her kid. She's an AH too. Kiddo is not the drive your drunk parent option. \n\nYour poor daughters... Caught between Unreasonable mcScreamface  and Drinky McForgetimmaparent. \n\nYour kids deserve better than both of you.\n\nAlso in what weirdo blackmail I'm not a parent universe does buying one kid a car that you punish them with over ridiculous nonsense mean that your kid buys your other kid a car... That's bizarre. Knock it off Mr. Can't be bothered to parent, can only scream.", "YTA, Jesus Christ", "YTA. Such an AH. What are you teaching your daughter with this behavior? Would it have been responsible for her to ditch her mother late at night so she could comply with your stupid orders? Why is it important she be home by 10 pm? Because you say so? You knew where she was. You knew she was with her mother. What exactly was she doing wrong?\n\nThe reality is that all you are teaching your daughter with this \"parenting\" is that you are a vindictive AH who doesn't know how to be a dad, so you make up for that by being loud and rude.  Don't be surprised when your kids turn 18 and never speak to you again.", "YTA. I hope you\u2019re not surprised when both of your daughters decide to never speak to you again. If my dad talked to me like that, I\u2019d be telling the courts. Verbal abuse is totally not an acceptable response to your daughter being a responsible person after keeping you updated. You\u2019re a control freak who hates your ex and your daughters can see that", "YTA. Jeez. You\u2019re letting your dislike of your ex affect your relationship with your daughter. What was lily supposed to do, leave her own mother stranded?", "YTA", "Go to therapy, dude", "YTA.\nWhat's wrong with you?? I strongly suggest you get a mental health evaluation and therapy, cause you're very close in permanently damaging your relationship with your kids, she'll cut off contact as soon as she can. You sound unstable and with anger management issues.", "YtA - While your daughter could have texted with updates, the situation was out of her control with the pizza arriving late. \n\nEven so, whether being on Bluetooth or not, being 12 minutes late because of not having those who were drinking drive does not warrant that reaction. Things happen. And she could've hosen to not pick up the phone and updated you as well.", "YTA.\n\nYou're being overly rigid, unreasonable and letting your hostility towards your ex cloud your judgment. \n\nI am not exactly thrilled about your ex drinking while out with her minor child and asking her to play DD but you cursing at Lily for ensuring her mother's safety and being less than 15 minutes late because of it, then imposing a disproportionate punishment is just plain bad parenting.", "YTA.  JC, she was 12 minutes late! This does not warrant such a severe punishment because it involved her mom not sex, drugs or rock & roll!  \n\nThis makes for a warning not a punishment.  You better get a grip on the hill to die on; this isn\u2019t it.", "YTA, is there a reason you hate your ex-wife so much? That you're willing to punish your daughter over something so petty? It's not like your daughter was out with friends or partying somewhere. She was literally with her MOTHER. . Unless there's a lot of information missing from this post, because I cant understand your reaction .", "YTA. First, serious overreaction. She was late by less than 15 minutes, plus you were in contact with Lily. So it's not like you were unaware of her whereabouts. You flew off the handle for no reason. Second, you're just a control freak. Something that's gonna come back to bite you when Lily drops all contact the day she turns 18. Which I hope she does because you're a toxic control freak that needs a serious attitude adjustment.", "YTA, grow up , we clearly see who the problem is. She was with her mother\u2026 her mother ! Not some friends", "YTA - who talks to their kids like that?  Cringe.", "YTA. She was 12 minutes late because the pizza came late WHILE SHE WAS WITH HER MOM! She wasn't in the back seat of the car getting pregnant! WTF is wrong with you for talking to her like that?", "It\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t know where she was the whole time.

You seem really controlling, mean and inflexible. Those are bad qualities.", "YTA. 10 on a Friday is a bit early for a 16 yo. The food was late. She was with her mom. I think making sure her mom got home safe shows responsibility/maturity. I also think you are projecting your feelings towards your ex on your daughter.

See you in 3-5 yrs wondering why your daughters have gone NC w you.", "Yta for verbal abuse", "I\u2019d say that both parents are TA. She was just 12 minutes late! You did say that you overreacted and I\u2019m glad you see that, however, you shouldn\u2019t punish your daughter for her mothers actions. Part of me almost thinks that her mom did that to spite you.

This is just my opinion on one side of the story.", "YTA.\n\nThis isn't a meaningful violation of a rule, and I'm sure you actually know that.\n\n You could argue that the supervising parent was being irresponsible, but that's not your daughter's fault. Your daughter was responsible. She kept you in the loop, and she did not let someone who had been drinking drive.\n\nYou cursed at your child, who was stuck between a rock and a hard place, and was not out unsupervised, and you then punished her for her mother's behavior. What's the actual point here? To punish your ex-wife? To make your daughter afraid to spend any time with her mother during your custodial time?\n\nThis is not a good look.

If your manager spoke that way to you and treated you that way, wouldn't you be looking for a different job, if not quit on the spot?\n\nYour daughter DESERVES to be treated with kindness and respect ESPECIALLY by her parents.  You were mad at her and so you were rude to her, screamed at her, and then took away something meaningful to her. \n\nAll you are doing is setting up your daughter for abuse in her own adult relationships.  You are teaching her that it's OK for a man who says he loves her to scream and curse at her, to take things from her just because everything didn't go exactly the way he wanted.  You are teaching her to accept ALL of this. \n\nHow would you feel if she had a boyfriend and he treated her the way you did???\n\nYou are setting the standard she will unconsciously apply to prospective partners.  You are FAILING her, you are setting her up to accept a lifetime of abuse. \n\nTake responsibility, go to therapy and work on this.  Treat your daughter with care and kindness.", "YTA. My parents had high expectations, but thankfully not bullshit like this. My grandpa was like this with my mom. We no longer talk to that side of the family.

Over 12 minutes?  YTA.  Don\u2019t be surprised when she no longer speaks to you.", "YTA Not because of your curfew and not because you took away the car. I think that's a little harsh but if you feel you need to make the point, fine. YTA for that awful language to your daughter and yelling like that. Yes, she was going to be late but her mother put her in that position, probably to irritate you (it worked!) but there are rules and there are reasonable allowances. So sure, take the car away for a week, although again, a bit harsh for 12 minutes especially if she's not prone to this but to scream the f-bomb at her? Learn to control your temper and your language. And realize that exceptions exist or the only thing you'll see on her 18th birthday is the door slamming and that will be it.", "Wow.

You took her car because she did the right thing by making sure they got home safe.", "YTA- the lesson you taught Lily is that being home on time is much more important than being safe. Let's hope she doesn't end up paying for it in the future after having a beer or two at a party with curfew creeping up.", "Mega YTA\nThere are much better ways to talk to your child beyond yelling and cursing. Your child told you where they were and were being responsible for taking home two people who had imbibed. That shows responsibility. It's a good lesson as it shows them not to drink and drive themselves.\n12 mins late is not bad.

Daughter is with mom.  Mom should be planning time for going out to eat, getting home and getting daughter home on time.  Timeline suggests that Mom and friend are, in fact, using daughter as DD.  That is just icky on so many levels.  You don\u2019t go to a pizza place after 9 pm and expect to order, eat, booze it up, drive mommy home, then daughter drives home.  Mom is total AH for that.  \n\nYou are AH for yelling at your daughter.  That is abisive.  You are unwise to enforce curfew so stringently.  You should expect he to be afraid to be late in the future as she will get in a lot of trouble, even if it is not her fault she is late.  You can expect her to learn to lie to you as well.

But your daughter could use more understanding and obviously cursing at her is unacceptable.", "This type of behavior would make me su*c*dal if I was your child. YTA obviously", "YTA man. It's ok to have rules, but when your daughter is with and listening to her mom you're putting her in a really unfair situation. She was texting you the whole time. It was 12 minutes, she had an excuse even if you don't like the mom. You need to apologize to daughter ASAP.", "YTA. Clearly and absolutely. Your daughter was clear and honest with you about what was going on. Food was running a bit late and she was ensuring people got home safely. She was just 12 minutes late even with that. All you are doing is ensuring she lies to you in the future. I sincerely hope she and her sister get some say in where they live moving forward and can avoid you sooner rather than just never speaking to you again at 18.\n\nEdit: Edited for grammatical clarity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I told her that's fine, but be home by 10.\n\nAt about 945 I called to remind her that she needed to be home by 10. She said their pizza had just gotten to them and she would be home in a few minutes.\n\n10:00 hits and she isn't home so by now I am pretty frustrated and admittedly I did lose my temper a bit, but her mom knows when I say 10 I mean 10. Not 10:05, not 10:02.\n\nSo I called Lily and said \"Where the fuck are you at? It's 10 and I told you to be home!\" She said \"our pizza came late and mom asked if I could drop her and Nikki (mom's friend) off at home because they had a couple drinks during dinner.\"\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck, you aren't your mom's DD. Now get your ass home.\"\n\nWell unknown to me, her mom and friend were just getting out of the car and I was on bluetooth so they heard me yelling at Lily.\n\nI don't really care, because they already think I'm an AH, but at my house, rules are to be followed. Their mom thinks she can be their friend but that doesn't fly with me.\n\nWhen Lily got home (10:12), I took her keys and told her to tell her mom she will have to pick the girls up for their time at her house. Now I'm even more of an AH apparently, because she will have to take them back and forth to school instead of them being able to drive. I say that's too bad, she shouldn't have kept my daughter out past when I told her to be home. \n\nThe agreement was that I would buy Lily a car and she would buy Hannah a car when she's old enough, so I own the car. \n\nMaybe I shouldn't have yelled at her quite so bad, but what am I supposed to do, just have no rules and let them do whatever they want?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I understand you in some ways, but yet: \nShe told you the pizza came late, so obviously she could have not finished it and be home by 10. Yes, I understand, your house, your rules, but really? Expect your daughter to go out for pizza, but then get mad at her, because she actually wants to eat her pizza??? I mean come on, you gotta be a little bit more flexible. She wasn\u2019t snorting cocaine with her shitty friends. Or is that what you are afraid of? Or you just still couldn\u2019t move on your divorce and blame everyone else but yourself because of it?", "She got home late? Was she drunk? Was she high? Did she steal something? She could be doing things a lot worse and you're getting mad at being a bit late. \n\nI suggest you tell her to be home AROUND a certain time for her sake and yours. This isn't the army. She needs a comfort zone at home. She can learn punctuality from school and work when it's time for her to learn that. Maybe you can scold her then. And swear?! You're 3 years older than I am. I try not to swear even around OTHER peoples kids. Control yourself and be an adult", "Woooooow YTA. The way you yell and swear at your children? Thats verbal and emotional abuse. Sorry to tell ya, this is bad parenting and need some serious therapy to learn how to manage your anger, cus lemme tell you\u2026 based on this post you need some *serious* work in the self-regulation department. \n\nBe honest, you were mad that your kid was with her mom on your day. So you guys need to re-establish the boundary that your days are yours and moms days are hers. That\u2019s a discussion between you and their mom and you should NOT be taking out your anger on your daughters. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t out with some kids past curfew, she was with her mother. She was supervised and with someone who will ensure her safety and well-being. She wasn\u2019t out getting into trouble. \n\nYou owe your daughter a *massive* apology. And beyond that, you need to do the self work to ensure you don\u2019t take your anger out on your girls like that ever again. It is beyond unacceptable. You are teaching your daughters that it\u2019s OK for men to scream and swear at them when they are angry. Is that the message you want ingrained in their brains? If you saw a boyfriend yell at your daughter like you did for doing something they didn\u2019t like, would you be OK with it? I sure hope not. Do better.", "Holy shit. You are def the ah", "YTA. Definitely.", "YTA because you're too rigid. 10:12 is close enough to 10. While I was reading, I was expecting something like your daughter coming home at midnight, maybe even being out of touch. As a mom and another person who watches the clock, I'm telling you that you need to loosen up a little. Also, swearing and yelling was not appropriate. You definitely had expectations that are too high, and it's really not your daughter's fault.", "What tf do you mean \u201cmight be the asshole\u201d YOU ARE THE FREAKING ASSHOLE. She was with her mother what did you think was going to happen? Even if you were to hate the mother of your children that much, are you really okay with having on your conscience if something were to happen to them if your daughter would\u2019ve just left them there? If so you\u2019re just damm spiteful. \n\nShe had contact with you throughout the entire night. You knew what she was. She wasn\u2019t ignoring your calls, She was not doing something illegal. Going from 0 to 100ike this is unreasonable. You\u2019re just a sad man, and a sad excuse for a father at that. I hope you\u2019re prepared for the lack of relationship your kids will have with you in the near future.", "You\u2019re such a joke. Seriously think about what you\u2019re mad at. You\u2019re mad that you don\u2019t have complete control. It could have been as easy as calling your daughter, asking where she was and coming to a compromise. OP, getting home at 10:02 is no different than arriving at 10:00 unless there is someone controlling and inconsiderate there waiting for you. Get over yourself.\n\nEdit to add: My dad was like this growing up and I moved out before I was 18 because I couldn\u2019t get away fast enough. If you value 12 minutes over your relationship with your daughter, she deserves so much better.", "YTA. OP at 16 your daughter isn't obliged to follow the custody agreement, she can choose to not live with you. You punished her for being with her mother. You should never make your kids choose between their parents because it is childish, petty and not what a good parent does. I feel very sorry for both of your daughters. Fully expect both to go LC or NC until they surface with your worst nightmare for a husband, bf or baby daddy.", "YTA \nWhat. The actual. Fuck?\n\nOkay let me get this right.\n\nYou yelled at your daughter, caused a scene WHILE SHE WAS FUCKING DRIVING, and then took away her car over FUCKING 12 MINUTES?!\n\nSir. This isn't about rules. Curfews exist to keep your children safe. The purpose is that you know where they are at night. \n\nYour daughter was with her mother. A responsible adult who was making sure she is save. You just called her so you knew she was okay (by the way, controll freak much???), then when your daughter didn't come in the *second* the curfew hit you blew up and yelled at her.\n\nNo 'are you okay?' no concern, no basic respect?\n\nAlso why would your daugher be expected to buy her sister a car?? The fuck??\n\nSir you claimed your wife \"wants to be their friend.\" No I think she's just not emotionally abusive and treats her children like human beings. Which annoys you because you seem to think your kids are objects for you to control. \n\nHonestly hope you will be happy once they go low contact with you and you rot alone and lonely in a retirement home. That's what you deserve judging by this post.", "So anyways have fun being lonely when your daughters move in with mom - YTA", "YTA have fun not being invited to your daughters wedding for being a bad father. Seriously what kind of man speaks to their own daughter like that!?! Grow up", "YTA. You\u2019re taking it out on your daughter that you hate your ex-wife. Stop it. She and her sister didn\u2019t ask to be put in the middle of your nasty divorce. You knew where she was, who she was with, and what she was doing. You chose to be a verbally abusive control freak instead of being the slightest bit patient. Get ready for your daughters to cut off all contact with you the second they turn 18 or as soon as a judge says it\u2019s okay for them to.

Get help.", "YTA.\n\nShe was with her mother. And she was only 12 minutes late! It\u2019s not like she was 3 hours late! Plus it was a weekend. Who the frick gives a 16 year old a 10:00 curfew on the weekend?\n\nI think I know who caused the divorce to be nasty based on this post. You scream and curse out your 16 year old. I mean, who the hell does that??? She was in touch with you the entire time, so it\u2019s not like you had anything to be worried about.\n\nJeez mate.

What caused you guy\u2019s to get divorced anyways?", "There is something seriously wrong with you, and I strongly suggest counseling- both individual and family.

But you clearly don\u2019t care either way", "YTA and you are mean.  You are obsessed with control and are happy to punish your kid for being kind to your ex.\n\nYou will end up alone if you keep going like this.  But hey, you'll be in control and the BIG BOSS OF THE HOUSE all by yourself, amirite?", "You were mad at your ex, so you took it out on your kid. Way to be a stereotype. YTA. Stop punishing your child because you hate your ex.", "YTA, for all the things that have already been said, but also for this:\n\nYou were looking for something to jump on. You called her at 9:45 to remind her to be home. What is that about? You know where she is, you know she's with her mother, and you still felt it was necessary to bull your way in to remind everyone *who's really in charge here*. Or at least, who you **think** should be in charge. Then you said 10:00 hit and \"by now I'm pretty frustrated\". By now. So you were frustrated before she was even due home. \n\nRun your house however you want, but just know that in 2 years, Lily will be so gone, and I bet Hannah will be, too. She'll have the car from her mom, and you won't have anything to hold her. \n\nYou are a pathetic hothead, and oh so absolutely the asshole.", "YTA. Your hate for your ex is obvious.

There is absolutely no reason to speak to your daughter like that. She was with her mother. She was being responsible. You're inflexible and non-understanding nature will not win you the respect you think is owed to you. \n\nNo wonder you are divorced. Your ex thinks you're an AH for a reason. Show her a little respect as well. She is the mother of your children. They have half her DNA. Grow up. Act like a father, not a screaming turd.", "YTA.

She was out with her mom. Your behavior was completely unacceptable.

Once she is 18 there will be no 50/50 she will not be obligated by law to even be in your presence.  I'm not saying you should let your kid have a free for all, but your clearly knew where she was, with who and she kept good communication ie she wasn't hanging up on you. 15 minutes is nothing, you should give a small amount of leeway you never know what could happen, so to take away the car for that you kinda are YTA.", "YTA she was with her mom.

It was the weekend, not a school night. Ten is early for a 16 year old. Especially one who is out with a parent. Yelling and cursing is not a parenting technique.

She was engaging in responsible driving. She was communicating with you. She was trying to enjoy her night with food and trivia. She did absolutely nothing wrong. You are punishing her to punish her mother. You are punishing her to exert your authority blindly. You are the exact opposite parent everyone hopes to have.

What are you teaching her?  She answered her phone.  She kept you informed.  She's a good kid.  You should have vented your frustrations at their mother, in a respectful way.

Don\u2019t curse at your daughter. \nI won\u2019t be surprised if she goes NC in a couple years. You sound like a terrible parent", "YTA, first the way you talked to your daughter. Disrespectful. You didn\u2019t logically think, you emotionally reacted. The way your emotionally react is horrible. You and your ex need to find a way to communicate in a healthy way otherwise you\u2019re just giving both of your kids an unreasonable amount of stress. Not to mention. You are teaching your daughter that it\u2019s okay for men to speak to her that way. Your ex asked your kid to pick her up and she did. If you have a problem with that. You communicate with the ex. Not yell at the daughter who didn\u2019t have a choice. \nAlso, step up your parenting. If you decide to take away the car. You can also take them to and from school. That\u2019s your responsibility. \n\nYou fucked up. You need to apologize for your mistake. You and your ex need to find a way to communicate in a healthy way. Do it for your kids. If anything. Also, I suggest you get therapy to work out your anger who you\u2019re also projecting onto your kids.", "Yes, YTA. For so very many reasons.", "I\u2019m going to guess that the way you spoke to your daughter is probably the reason your wife divorced your ass. You are definitely the asshole. Lighten up, your daughters will soon no longer to be required to live with you 50% of the time. Don\u2019t be surprised when they go no contact with you. YTA", "YTA, stop whining, apologize to your daughter and give her back her car keys.\n\nfor the love of god, she was out with her *mother* on friday night and you freak out about  curfew? 10:12 isnt bad at all, if anything she should have stayed out longer! If shes gonna get yelled at by her irrational asshole dad she might as well live it up.\n\nAlso, SHE CALLED YOU! she was being responsible! god, I can see why you had a messy divorce you sound exhausting god damn.\n\nchill out and go to therapy cause yall got some anger problems to be acting like that.", "yta yta yta. you're teaching the wrong lesson to your daughter, and you stepping on her, exerting control and being petty towards her mother can attract the wrong crowd towards her as you're teaching her that it's OKAY to be blatantly disrespected like that. don't be surprised when she doesn't talk to you anymore in two years time.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re her father, not her drill sergeant. You don\u2019t curse at your children because they are going to be home 10 minutes later than you EXPECT them to be home by. YOU DON\u2019T CURSE AT YOUR CHILDREN, PERIOD. You couldn\u2019t even be considerate enough to let her finish her food and make sure her mother got home safe. If you are already considered the AH to **multiple** people who are involved, it\u2019s time to self reflect. You need to dial it the fuck back, because right now you\u2019re speed running your way to the retirement home.\n\nAlso, it completely sounds like you\u2019re putting your poor daughter down to actually just punish your ex wife. Because you\u2019re only inconveniencing her and your daughter, which just makes you even more of an AH.", "Shocking that you had a nasty divorce and usually end up in arguments with your ex. Who could have guessed? /s\n\nYTA", "YTA- she wasn\u2019t hanging out with friends, she was with her MOTHER. Now I feel you about being her mother\u2019s DD but it doesn\u2019t sound like its something she\u2019s typically tasked to do.", "YTA. You are letting your anger towards your ex bleed out to your child. She\u2019s with her mother, she communicated with you, and everyone got home safe. Yes, it was 12 minutes late but does that really matter? Either way there is no reason for you to cuss out your child like that. I don\u2019t think she should have her car taken away either because this isn\u2019t her fault. The ex is an AH for expecting her daughter to drive her and her friend home after drinking too. Both of you as parents need to do better.", "YTA. She was literally with her mom. It was 12 minutes. This isn't about rules, this is about you being a control freak AND definitely an asshole. No one questions why you're divorced.", "YTA 10:00 not 10:02. Imagine living your life with such precision. You sound super rigid and controlling. I suspect time spent with your kids will be very rare once they are out on their own. You are making them afraid of you because you are so rigid.", "I get that it pisses you off your ex made your daughter be her dd and is irresponsible with your daughter\u2019s time and your rules. It feels like a dig at you and might very well be one. Your daughter isn\u2019t the enemy here though. My mom is perpetually late. It\u2019s stressful. Idk your daughter, obviously, but I feel safe to say she was probably stressed her mom was making her late. Rock hard place. She still cares about her mom regardless of your feelings so yeah she\u2019s going to drive her irresponsible mom home since she got drunk/tipsy whatever. She sounds like a good kid albeit stuck between you two and struggling. You are punishing your ex through your daughter. See the having to drive them bit. Yta. Have a talk with your daughter about her feelings about everything. Be understanding and fucking listen.", "[removed]", "YTA. She could not help the restaurant was busy and their pizza did not come until a few minutes before you told her to be home. And she was with her mother for Christ sakes. She wasn\u2019t out roaming around with other teenagers. Quit putting your daughter in the middle of you being a sick to your ex wife.", "YTA my dad wasn\u2019t even quite as bad as you, and I snuck out and later went very low contact. He was excessively strict. I had sex at 15 and smoked and drank. Being overly strict backfires.", "YTA. I hope you are happy with the car when your daughter cuts you out of her life for being a controlling AH. She was with her MOTHER. She wasn't out drinking and drugging. Don't be shocked when she moves in with her mother full time and tells you to shove the car.", "YTA\n\nThe whole interaction is assholery", "YTA I see why you are divorced and if the daughters have a say you won't be seeing them either.", "You sound like my dad when I was young\u2026we don\u2019t have a good relationship today. Hope you change while she\u2019s home with you", "Wow, you should get used to the idea of your daughter probably living with your wife full time once she's 18 and hardly ever talking to you. Definitely YTA and there's no other way around it.", "[removed]", "Ugh, it seems the hatred you have for your ex wife is spilling over into the relationship with your daughters. It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t communicate with you immediately when you called her. She also told you she was with her mom. Not out drinking or with a boy or doing illegal drugs. Just getting pizza.\n\nYou seem to need to be in control and I understand that your rules are your rules but life happens and you seem to have a good kid. What was she supposed to do?! Leave her mom? She lives with her 1/2 the time. This is a conversation for you and your ex wife. She should not be held responsible for an issue your ex wife caused. Apologize to your daughter and give her back her keys.\n\nYTA already but you\u2019d be a bigger asshole for not making things right with you daughter. You will also drive a wedge in your relationship if you keep treating her like crap because of her moms actions.", "When I was a teenager, my dad told me to be home by midnight one NYE. I genuinely lost track track of time and didn't turn on to our street until like 1am. I knew he would be lying awake in his room, understandably upset. But as I turned that corner, I saw flames and smoke coming out of our trash can up under our roof. Someone hadn't put out the fireworks properly. I pulled the trash can out as far as I could without burning myself and bolted to get my dad. We got the fire out, and then we calmly talked about why it wasn't a free pass on the curfew, but he was proud of me for acting quick on the fire. He was mostly (very understandably) mad about the curfew cuz he was very worried, and I swore I wouldn't do that to him again.\n\nThe moral of this story is that life happens. And sometimes rules get broken, but things also happen for the good once in a while when it doesnt feel like it; like your kid making sure her mom and friend got home safely after the pizza was late. \n\nI am extremely close to my dad still 15yrs later. Don't ruin your relationship with your kids long term by acting like this. \n\nShe had enough good sense to call and tell you she'd be late, and why. Give her a break. Get to the basis of your anger and talk it out with her calmly and reasonably. She seems like a good kid. Don't break the trust and love she still has for you over this foolishness.", "YTA\n\nYour poor children, they can not get a break at all.\n\nYou are punishing/yelling at the wrong person.\n\nIf your daughter disobeys you she gets in trouble.  If your daughter disobeys her mother she gets in trouble.  Problem here is that she is in the middle, where her mother is telling her one thing and you are yelling at her to do something else.  And then punishing her when it was clearly beyond her control.", "Well we can see why you're divorced. YTA, and on the fast track to having your kids hate you when their adults", "You and your wife seriously need to get over yourselves and coparent. Thinking she would refuse to drop her parent off when asked\u2026you seriously think a sixteen-year-old would refuse to drop her mom off when mom shouldn\u2019t drive?

YTA", "I'm 37 and if I showed up at work 12 minuets late, after warning my boss, and they reacted by cussing me out I would quit that job.  It's only a few years before Lilly can chose to quit a relationship with you.\n\nWhat are you trying to do here? If you're trying to raise her to be responsible, congratulations, she already is.

Tune in this time 2 years from now. \"My daughter moved out as soon as she was able and I haven't heard from her since. Why is her mom turning her against me?", "YTA\n\n1. No normal person talks to their daughter that way.\n2. She wasn't very late, and you'd also just recently spoken to her so you knew she was safe. How you reacted was way out of proportion.\n3. This stinks of you asserting control. Calling before to be sure she remembered to be back by 10\n4. This also stinks of the classic \"parents totally hate each other so the kids get caught in the middle of their immature crap\" situation", "YTA!  I cannot believe what I have just read. You are punishing your daughter for being a decent human being and giving her mother a ride home.  You are absolutely right tho. Your ex wife should have totally got behind the wheel of a car and possibly hurt or killed an innocent person instead of being a responsible adult and having her own daughter drive her home.  Are you for real?!", "YTA, you're controlling and verbally abusive, there was no need at all for the swearing and the way you went off at her. Your daughters are old enough to decide who they want to stay with and I sincerely hope they do just that and stop staying with you. She kept communication with you and was being responsible making sure her mum got home. \n\nYou are trying to raise her to care more about your dictations that other people's safety. What if on her way home she saw someone that needed help? In your view screw them because my rules are law. You're heading for no contact with your child and you don't even care, I'm not surprised you're divorced or that it was tumultuous.", "YTA and a failure as a parent", "YTA : BIG TIME! stop fucking cussing at your underage child. you\u2019re suppose to be the adult so fucking act like it when you talk to her. my dad was the same way when i was 20 & i bought my own fucking car. best to say i moved out 3 weeks after & am now 24 living the life in a completely different state & he always asks why do i hardly speak to him anymore. you can do the whole \u201cmy house, my rules\u201d. no one\u2019s gonna crucify you for that, but when you take it to a tyrannical level w/ the whole \u201ci\u2019m the parent. you\u2019re the kid. you do as i say, when i say it, & how i tell you to do it\u201d then it\u2019s not about being a parent worried about your kid, but about showing dominance & being controlling. also to mention, she was driving her mom & friend home who had been drinking. that right there is enough to praise your daughter for not allowing driving & driving. lay off of her dude, & go to fucking therapy for your obvious anger issues.", "YTA\n\nEasy guess that the divorce was because you are super controlling and mean", "YTA for swearing at your child. \nBut you\u2019re right, she isn\u2019t their DD nor should she be.\nYou could have been better about this, you\u2019re not entirely in the right or clear for taking her car, a warning would suffice, she was pressured.", "YTA. You can excuse your behavior all you want, and retreat to the unassailable refuge of, \"Rules are to be followed\", but this had nothing to do with rules. You're a vengeful person who wanted to make your ex seem less important than you, and you punished your daughter for DARING to give her a ride home. This is about control, insecurity and vindictiveness. You had no real concern about your daughter's safety, and yelling at her makes you feel better. Being able to punish her is a power trip for you. You are a terrible father, and she will grow to resent you while you continue to make excuses for bullying your own child. You should probably prepare yourself to lose her when she moves out, and understand that you are the cause of her resentment.", "YTA bud.  YTA.", "YTA. Your daughter kept you informed of where she was and what she was doing. She was also with her mother. Yes it was your time, but she was with a parent.  You can, of course, discuss expectations and your belief that when she is at your house for your time, her mother is not an excuse to be late and then lay out reasonable consequences for being late.  But the pizza taking longer than expected was out of your daughter's control. And refusing to drive her other parent when asked, was also a difficult position for your daughter to be in. Angry father or angry mother? Also, a calm discussion with your ex-wife about your expectations and the consequences of daughter being late is warranted. You taking away your daughter's car does inconvenience her mother since they already have an established routine and since you will not be the owner of your younger daughter's vehicle, you will be treating the girls differently. Finally, do you always behave this way? If you do, you probably don't have to worry much longer about what your daughters are doing because they won't want to be around you once they have a choice.", "YTA. She was out with her mother, not unsupervised. You are petty and verbally abusive, and parents who hurt their children to spite their exes are the worst people.

Abusive parents who use their children to hurt their exes suck.", "YTA\n\nOne, you should have yelled profanity at your teenaged daughter. I cuss like crazy, but I never yell cuss words at my daughters! \n\nYour daughter told you at 9:45 that she had just gotten the pizza. In other words, she explained why she was running late. So you had no reason to yell like that.\n\nHer mother was in charge of her at that point, so you were blaming Lily for her mother's behavior. Which wasn't that bad anyway--she was TWELVE minutes late! TWELVE! Twelve minutes is nothing. Twelve minutes is rounding error.\n\nBut say it required punishment. You went overboard. For twelve minutes--which you told about in advance--she could be grounded for a couple of days or do some extra chores or something similar. Taking away the car was going overboard.\n\nAnd you were totally messing with her mother just to mess with her.\n\nNo wonder every discussion you have with your ex ends in an argument.", "OP, I hope you see this. \n\nmy dad used to speak and treat my sister and I like this. I cut him off for months at around your daughters age for it. He would speak to us the exact same way, swear, berate, demand we listen without any \u201cback talk\u201d or freedom with age etc.\n\nI cut him off and both daughters stuck to it because we were terrified of him and how he hurt us emotionally. He eventually read some self help books and has curbed his temper and has made amends and is now a stellar person. \n\nHe admitted to a family member this past month that the months we daughters refused to see him for his behavior, he\u2019d cry the weekends he was supposed to have us but we\u2019d refuse to come. Sat there and cried because he had failed to see how the way he spoke to us damaged us.\n\nI hope you get help OP, because you\u2019re an asshole to your kids just like mine was. A negligent jerk of a parent and kids deserve better. go to therapy, figure out your anger because you could end up like how my dad was and regretting it. Difference here is my dad had the emotional fortitude to fix it for his kids\u2026 I hope you can too for their sake", "YTA. Not the exact same situation but something you should think about. My wife's father provided for her well enough after her parents divorced, but was not easy to get along with. I can count on one hand how many times she has talked with him in the last 3 years.

What you do now, how you act, the way that you speak to them will 100% effect their choice. What divorced parents don\u2019t understand is that your kids once they are teenagers can actually just chose not to adhere to custody deals. How do I know this? At 16 I walked out of my moms house and went to go live with my dad. I never looked back and she had no ability to force me to go back to living with her. By 18 I had given up on trying and went no contact. My mother and I haven\u2019t spoken in a decade. \n\nI share this story for divorced parents. If you want your kids in your life, if you love them and value them, you need to treat your kids well above and beyond what other parents do. You have them half the time.

It\u2019s only 12 minutes. Mom shouldn\u2019t have used her as a DD especially if she knows the rules - that would have been good co parenting. Besides that you knew what was going in, you got updated throughout the 12(!) minutes. But you were also the one checking in and your daughter didn\u2019t notify you herself/ on her own.", "YTA you\u2019re directing your anger towards the person you can control, if anything you should talk to her mother, Lily didn\u2019t do anything wrong, she was just following the instructions of one of her parents.

Enforce rule, be a father, and be understanding. At this rate, you're gonna lose your kids and their respect when its gonna matter the most. Think about what kind of a relationship you want with your kids when you're old and ready to kick the bucket. \n\nI had a prenat like you, counted every minute I was late, even of it was due to being in rush hour traffic.

On top of that, by having a strict curfew with no flexibility, causes kids to drive more erratically, speed, break traffic laws and increase risk of accidents of they lose track of the time. \n\nYTA", "YTA you're horrible", "Wow. Don't come crying to reddit when your daughter goes NC with you once she becomes an adult. I cut my dad off for over a decade for crap like this. Controlling. Abusive.

You should of given her more flexibility since she did tell you during your 9:45 call that they had only just got their pizza. They need time to eat. Food wait times can suck sometimes, just over a week ago my group had to wait over an hour and a half for our food to come, we ended up having to take it away in takeaway boxes since we didn\u2019t have time to finish our food.\n\n2. You should of been more understanding because Lily was stepping up to help her mum out. Jenny (mum) & Nikki (mum\u2019s friend) had alcohol in their system and knew that it was unsafe for them to drive themselves home so they asked Lily because they knew she\u2019s a good and responsible driver. She was stepping up & being more grown up doing this. Plus she did had parental supervision from her mum.\n\n3. You really should of given her more leeway/flexibility because all drivers know it\u2019s a pain in the neck to get stuck in traffic. You should of given her until at least 10:30 with a check in at 10:15 (if she hadn\u2019t been home before then).\n\n4. Rules can have a bit of flexibility, Lily was trying to get home on time but helped to get her mum home first which caused her to be late. She was only 12 minutes late. You are way too strict with her. I get you want her to respect your rules but she had a valid reason so you should been more understanding.\n\n5. Was the swearing really that necessary? No I don\u2019t think it was. You should apologise to her for getting so angry so quickly when it wasn\u2019t needed.\n\nTo sum everything up you acted like a bully to your daughter for no reason. You need to apologise to her and give her back her car. You needed to be way more understanding with Lily. You are definitely an AH.", "YTA. This wasnt about parenting. This was about exerting control and being petty at the same time. No wonder you have an ex wife. Its starting to look like you will have ex chilren as well not too far in the future.

Then at least you will still have your rules to keep you company and take care of you in your old age.", "YTA\nWhat a BOOMER mentality.

Are you this fucking dense? There is a difference between swearing at your child and being a proper parent. There is also a time and a place for strict enforcement of rules and a time to use your brain and think that maybe 12 minutes is not a big deal. She was giving her mom a ride home after a meal. You sound utterly insufferable\n\nYTA and despite your attempts to paint your wife as the bad guy in your post, you're making it clear why you're divorced and why your kids will probably soon be requesting to live with their mom full-time if you don't give your head a shake.

Do not put them in the middle of whatever grudge you hold against your ex-wife. I know first-hand what that shit does to the kids involved and it will lead to resentment and mental health issues. All you\u2019re doing is using them as a scapegoat for when one parent doesn\u2019t like what the other has said, and instead the anger is directed at the girls and not yourselves.", "Also\nIt was 12 minutes and she's 16\nTaking the car is rather extreme for that even if she hadn't been communicating", "I wonder if the kids are counting the minutes until they get to say bye to dad? \n\nOP YTA.

Both divorced. One wanted to be friends, the other wanted to be a hardass. Growing up as the oldest I eventually figured out it was somehow my responsibility to keep the peace. That means making sure mom leaves on time to drop us off at dad's so dad didnt get mad, or making sure brother was home on time so dad didnt get mad, etc etc. \n\nThe result? As a child I DEEPLY preferred to be at mom's. Not because there were no rules, but because she respected me enough to not yell at me if things go awry. She helped me understand why rules existed and we would come up with compromises if need be. As an adult I have deep seated anxiety in general, and constant fear my dad will get upset at any small slip up. I'm not my full self around him and it's all because he cared more about rules and appearances than having a relationship with the human being that is his daughter. It's honestly acked me up and ruined a lot of my own relationships.\n\nOP: your daughter was between a rock and a hard place with both her parents. She loves both and wants to do right by both. You need to have more empathy for her situation. Definitely YTA for blowing up so intensely when a 16 year old was home only less than 20 minutes after the designated time BC she was trying to be the responsible one. Be honest: this isn't about the \"rules\". This is about control - both of your daughter and of your ex. You wanted to punish your ex just as much as your kid and that honestly sucks. Your kids shouldnt be the rope you use in a tug-of-war with your ex. It's going to result in a very screwed up adult daughter and potentially a terrible relationship between you two.", "> A 10 pm curfew for a 16 year old on the weekend is strict as it is.\n\nI wouldn't go that far. 10pm for a new teenage driver is pretty spot on. Other than the rare exception for a late movie there's nothing open for teens to do at that hour except for Denny's and getting into dumb shit.\n\nI do agree in general that the presence of her Mother generally vetoes the curfew, but if the mother is using her teenage daughter as a DD as accused then that's grossly irresponsible behavior.", "If you agreed to buy the car, she should have it. Her punishment was excessive. She knows she doesn't want to drive at night, so she might go a month without using her car on the weekends.", "Let\u2019s be clear, he didn\u2019t say \u201cwhere the fuck are you?\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cwhere the fuck you at?\u201d\n\nSo not only is he a schmuck for swearing/yelling at his kid, he\u2019s a dumb one with atrocious grammar.", "\"AITA for yelling at my daughter because she won't let me visit my grandchild without her supervision?\n\nYTA", "I think he did it out of spite for his ex.", "My relationship with my parents improved _dramatically_ once they stopped trying to rule with an iron fist.

And given the presentation of the facts, I doubt it is.\n\nGood luck to your kids OP.

That was incredibly irresponsible.", "OP is no Thor.  He's just an asshole", "> OP doesn't see a middle ground between \"you do as I say, rules are meant to be followed\"\n\nOP is an authoritarian-style parent. My dad was the same way. We now have a strained relationship where he does not understand that respect does not mean total and complete capitulation to every whim. It has left me very conflict-avoidant and a chronic people-pleaser, which is convenient when you're a parent but sets your kid up for failure in life. I have difficulty setting boundaries because all that was taught to me was \"when I say jump, you say how high.\"\n\nOP, reconsider how you parent your children. You don't have to be their friend but you don't want to be the dictator that they feel the need to lie to lest you fly off the handle at your child being 12 minutes late for preventing someone else from driving drunk. She was with another parent and completely supervised. Do better.", "Well, actually there are more reasons to have kids home at a specific time. To teach them to keep your commitments and to learn how to manage your time. If you tell someone that you are home at 10 pm you have to plan ahead and start to get ready so that you be home on time. You learn when you can order anything, when you have to get up and pay, consider the walking distance to your car, how long your drive home is and when to start to say your goodbyes. And how to tell people that you cannot stay for one more drink. If you don't learn how to do all of this when you are young you will have trouble with this when you are an adult. \n\nAnd it is good to learn to keep to your commitments. If you stay out longer your parents have to stay up longer, because they are basically on call if anything happens. So the kid is messing up their schedule. Which is fine for important things, but not so much for just not wanting to go home.\n\nIt is not really important in this case as the daughter was with her mother, but in general enforcing a time to be home is not always a power play.", "I\u2019ll bet anger issues and his extremely controlling (frankly to the point of emotional abuse) attitude have a lot to do w it. I wonder if the kids will get to pick where they want to live if it goes to court again.", "Mine was 10p without prior authorization from parents. With communication i was allowed to stay out until around 1am give or take especially if i bussed home to give my parents a break from picking me up.", "2 drinks over the course of a 2 hour meal is unlikely to put the vast majority of people over the limit, never mind make them drunk.

This was effectively under mom\u2019s custody. 1000% this is an AH move. But I think there\u2019s a good chance this is a violation of the divorce agreement as well", "That\u2019s his version and  all that was said was a couple drinks, not drunk, which is responsible at worst and irrelevant if she was also their ride there", "We don\u2019t know if she actually got drunk, just that she had drank. I, personally, set up a DD even if I know I\u2019m only having one drink. We don\u2019t know mom and friends personal policy.\n\nThe daughter is 16, not 6, mom is modeling responsibility regarding drinking and driving. This is something the daughter will need to learn being a person who drives a car. It\u2019d be different if the mom is getting sloppy drunk, but I highly doubt that\u2019s the case because OP wouldn\u2019t hesitate to give that detail. \n\nAnecdotally, me and all my friends were our parent\u2019s DD at some point or another as a teen. It wasn\u2019t a bad experience for any of us, and our parents aren\u2019t bad parents or people.

I don\u2019t think it was her only option, she could\u2019ve gotten and Uber but again why do that when your daughter can drive you? She was 12 mins late so they don\u2019t live far apart from each other nor the restaurant. OP is TA for being highly unreasonable", "Setting a good example is irresponsible now? I\u2019d say that\u2019s a great way to practice what you preach.", "Here\u2019s another OP we will never see or hear from again / they just don\u2019t get it.", "Good call.
