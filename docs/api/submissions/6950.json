I told her that's fine, but be home by 10.\n\nAt about 945 I called to remind her that she needed to be home by 10. She said their pizza had just gotten to them and she would be home in a few minutes.\n\n10:00 hits and she isn't home so by now I am pretty frustrated and admittedly I did lose my temper a bit, but her mom knows when I say 10 I mean 10. Not 10:05, not 10:02.\n\nSo I called Lily and said \"Where the fuck are you at? It's 10 and I told you to be home!\" She said \"our pizza came late and mom asked if I could drop her and Nikki (mom's friend) off at home because they had a couple drinks during dinner.\"\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck, you aren't your mom's DD. Now get your ass home.\"\n\nWell unknown to me, her mom and friend were just getting out of the car and I was on bluetooth so they heard me yelling at Lily.\n\nI don't really care, because they already think I'm an AH, but at my house, rules are to be followed. Their mom thinks she can be their friend but that doesn't fly with me.\n\nWhen Lily got home (10:12), I took her keys and told her to tell her mom she will have to pick the girls up for their time at her house. Now I'm even more of an AH apparently, because she will have to take them back and forth to school instead of them being able to drive. I say that's too bad, she shouldn't have kept my daughter out past when I told her to be home. \n\nThe agreement was that I would buy Lily a car and she would buy Hannah a car when she's old enough, so I own the car. \n\nI think I might be the AH because maybe I shouldn't have yelled at her quite so bad, but what am I supposed to do, just have no rules and let them do whatever they want?", "created_utc": 1673316205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107xe1c/aita_for_taking_away_my_daughters_car/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't communicate with you when something isn't going as planned. \n\n2. You are not safe to make angry, so better to lie. \n\n3. If she is going to be late, better to ignore the call and just get yelled at at home, rather than on the phone and then again when she got home.\n\nShe was with her custodial parent, making the RIGHT choice to help people who had been drinking too much.

That's trivial.", "YTA, the person you are really upset with is your ex. You are taking it out on your daughter who is caught in the middle.", "YTA.  Not so much for taking away the car, although as the parent of a teen and having an ex-spouse of my own, I would offer a LITTLE grace when her mother is egging on the behavior your find objectionable.  That  alone does not squarely put you in AH territory.  Yelling at her in that way does.  You do need to be a parent and not a friend, but you *also need her to be able to talk freely to you about tough things and trust you to problem-solve collaboratively.*  This was in every way the opposite of that.  Instead of acknowledging that her mother had a role in these shenanigans and work on how to overcome that, knowing her skills are still developing here, you dumped all of your anger on your daughter when she wasn't the sole cause of it.\n\nEdited to finish the last clause.", "YTA and so is your Ex...  \n\nYou are screaming at a literal child. You are wrong. Very wrong. And as an adult it's in you to do better. Whatever is wrong with you, you need to fix. You are screaming at a child for what a parent asks of them. Literally screaming and cursing. Like a complete looney toon. \n\nYour ex is an AH for making a literal child a DD... Like what? No. That's her kid. She's an AH too. Kiddo is not the drive your drunk parent option. \n\nYour poor daughters...

What are you teaching your daughter with this behavior? Would it have been responsible for her to ditch her mother late at night so she could comply with your stupid orders? Why is it important she be home by 10 pm? Because you say so? You knew where she was. You knew she was with her mother. What exactly was she doing wrong?\n\nThe reality is that all you are teaching your daughter with this \"parenting\" is that you are a vindictive AH who doesn't know how to be a dad, so you make up for that by being loud and rude.  Don't be surprised when your kids turn 18 and never speak to you again.", "YTA. I hope you\u2019re not surprised when both of your daughters decide to never speak to you again. If my dad talked to me like that, I\u2019d be telling the courts. Verbal abuse is totally not an acceptable response to your daughter being a responsible person after keeping you updated. You\u2019re a control freak who hates your ex and your daughters can see that", "YTA. Jeez. You\u2019re letting your dislike of your ex affect your relationship with your daughter. What was lily supposed to do, leave her own mother stranded?", "YTA", "Go to therapy, dude", "YTA.\nWhat's wrong with you?? I strongly suggest you get a mental health evaluation and therapy, cause you're very close in permanently damaging your relationship with your kids, she'll cut off contact as soon as she can. You sound unstable and with anger management issues.", "YtA - While your daughter could have texted with updates, the situation was out of her control with the pizza arriving late. \n\nEven so, whether being on Bluetooth or not, being 12 minutes late because of not having those who were drinking drive does not warrant that reaction. Things happen. And she could've hosen to not pick up the phone and updated you as well.", "YTA.\n\nYou're being overly rigid, unreasonable and letting your hostility towards your ex cloud your judgment. \n\nI am not exactly thrilled about your ex drinking while out with her minor child and asking her to play DD but you cursing at Lily for ensuring her mother's safety and being less than 15 minutes late because of it, then imposing a disproportionate punishment is just plain bad parenting.", "YTA.  JC, she was 12 minutes late! This does not warrant such a severe punishment because it involved her mom not sex, drugs or rock & roll!  \n\nThis makes for a warning not a punishment.  You better get a grip on the hill to die on; this isn\u2019t it.", "YTA, is there a reason you hate your ex-wife so much? That you're willing to punish your daughter over something so petty? It's not like your daughter was out with friends or partying somewhere. She was literally with her MOTHER. . Unless there's a lot of information missing from this post, because I cant understand your reaction .", "YTA. First, serious overreaction. She was late by less than 15 minutes, plus you were in contact with Lily. So it's not like you were unaware of her whereabouts. You flew off the handle for no reason. Second, you're just a control freak. Something that's gonna come back to bite you when Lily drops all contact the day she turns 18. Which I hope she does because you're a toxic control freak that needs a serious attitude adjustment.", "YTA, grow up , we clearly see who the problem is. She was with her mother\u2026 her mother !

You seem really controlling, mean and inflexible. Those are bad qualities.", "YTA. 10 on a Friday is a bit early for a 16 yo. The food was late. She was with her mom.

This is just my opinion on one side of the story.", "YTA.\n\nThis isn't a meaningful violation of a rule, and I'm sure you actually know that.\n\n You could argue that the supervising parent was being irresponsible, but that's not your daughter's fault. Your daughter was responsible. She kept you in the loop, and she did not let someone who had been drinking drive.\n\nYou cursed at your child, who was stuck between a rock and a hard place, and was not out unsupervised, and you then punished her for her mother's behavior. What's the actual point here? To punish your ex-wife? To make your daughter afraid to spend any time with her mother during your custodial time?\n\nThis is not a good look.

If your manager spoke that way to you and treated you that way, wouldn't you be looking for a different job, if not quit on the spot?\n\nYour daughter DESERVES to be treated with kindness and respect ESPECIALLY by her parents.  You were mad at her and so you were rude to her, screamed at her, and then took away something meaningful to her. \n\nAll you are doing is setting up your daughter for abuse in her own adult relationships.  You are teaching her that it's OK for a man who says he loves her to scream and curse at her, to take things from her just because everything didn't go exactly the way he wanted.  You are teaching her to accept ALL of this. \n\nHow would you feel if she had a boyfriend and he treated her the way you did???\n\nYou are setting the standard she will unconsciously apply to prospective partners.  You are FAILING her, you are setting her up to accept a lifetime of abuse. \n\nTake responsibility, go to therapy and work on this.  Treat your daughter with care and kindness.", "YTA. My parents had high expectations, but thankfully not bullshit like this. My grandpa was like this with my mom. We no longer talk to that side of the family.

I think that's a little harsh but if you feel you need to make the point, fine. YTA for that awful language to your daughter and yelling like that. Yes, she was going to be late but her mother put her in that position, probably to irritate you (it worked!) but there are rules and there are reasonable allowances. So sure, take the car away for a week, although again, a bit harsh for 12 minutes especially if she's not prone to this but to scream the f-bomb at her? Learn to control your temper and your language. And realize that exceptions exist or the only thing you'll see on her 18th birthday is the door slamming and that will be it.", "Wow.

Daughter is with mom.  Mom should be planning time for going out to eat, getting home and getting daughter home on time.  Timeline suggests that Mom and friend are, in fact, using daughter as DD.

Mom is total AH for that.  \n\nYou are AH for yelling at your daughter.  That is abisive.  You are unwise to enforce curfew so stringently.  You should expect he to be afraid to be late in the future as she will get in a lot of trouble, even if it is not her fault she is late.  You can expect her to learn to lie to you as well.

It was 12 minutes, she had an excuse even if you don't like the mom. You need to apologize to daughter ASAP.", "YTA. Clearly and absolutely. Your daughter was clear and honest with you about what was going on. Food was running a bit late and she was ensuring people got home safely. She was just 12 minutes late even with that. All you are doing is ensuring she lies to you in the future. I sincerely hope she and her sister get some say in where they live moving forward and can avoid you sooner rather than just never speaking to you again at 18.\n\nEdit: Edited for grammatical clarity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I told her that's fine, but be home by 10.\n\nAt about 945 I called to remind her that she needed to be home by 10. She said their pizza had just gotten to them and she would be home in a few minutes.\n\n10:00 hits and she isn't home so by now I am pretty frustrated and admittedly I did lose my temper a bit, but her mom knows when I say 10 I mean 10. Not 10:05, not 10:02.\n\nSo I called Lily and said \"Where the fuck are you at? It's 10 and I told you to be home!\" She said \"our pizza came late and mom asked if I could drop her and Nikki (mom's friend) off at home because they had a couple drinks during dinner.\"\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck, you aren't your mom's DD. Now get your ass home.\"\n\nWell unknown to me, her mom and friend were just getting out of the car and I was on bluetooth so they heard me yelling at Lily.\n\nI don't really care, because they already think I'm an AH, but at my house, rules are to be followed. Their mom thinks she can be their friend but that doesn't fly with me.\n\nWhen Lily got home (10:12), I took her keys and told her to tell her mom she will have to pick the girls up for their time at her house. Now I'm even more of an AH apparently, because she will have to take them back and forth to school instead of them being able to drive. I say that's too bad, she shouldn't have kept my daughter out past when I told her to be home. \n\nThe agreement was that I would buy Lily a car and she would buy Hannah a car when she's old enough, so I own the car. \n\nMaybe I shouldn't have yelled at her quite so bad, but what am I supposed to do, just have no rules and let them do whatever they want?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I understand you in some ways, but yet: \nShe told you the pizza came late, so obviously she could have not finished it and be home by 10. Yes, I understand, your house, your rules, but really? Expect your daughter to go out for pizza, but then get mad at her, because she actually wants to eat her pizza??? I mean come on, you gotta be a little bit more flexible. She wasn\u2019t snorting cocaine with her shitty friends. Or is that what you are afraid of? Or you just still couldn\u2019t move on your divorce and blame everyone else but yourself because of it?", "She got home late? Was she drunk? Was she high? Did she steal something? She could be doing things a lot worse and you're getting mad at being a bit late. \n\nI suggest you tell her to be home AROUND a certain time for her sake and yours. This isn't the army. She needs a comfort zone at home. She can learn punctuality from school and work when it's time for her to learn that. Maybe you can scold her then. And swear?! You're 3 years older than I am. I try not to swear even around OTHER peoples kids. Control yourself and be an adult", "Woooooow YTA. The way you yell and swear at your children? Thats verbal and emotional abuse. Sorry to tell ya, this is bad parenting and need some serious therapy to learn how to manage your anger, cus lemme tell you\u2026 based on this post you need some *serious* work in the self-regulation department. \n\nBe honest, you were mad that your kid was with her mom on your day. So you guys need to re-establish the boundary that your days are yours and moms days are hers. That\u2019s a discussion between you and their mom and you should NOT be taking out your anger on your daughters. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t out with some kids past curfew, she was with her mother. She was supervised and with someone who will ensure her safety and well-being. She wasn\u2019t out getting into trouble. \n\nYou owe your daughter a *massive* apology. And beyond that, you need to do the self work to ensure you don\u2019t take your anger out on your girls like that ever again. It is beyond unacceptable. You are teaching your daughters that it\u2019s OK for men to scream and swear at them when they are angry. Is that the message you want ingrained in their brains? If you saw a boyfriend yell at your daughter like you did for doing something they didn\u2019t like, would you be OK with it? I sure hope not. Do better.", "Holy shit. You are def the ah", "YTA. Definitely.", "YTA because you're too rigid. 10:12 is close enough to 10. While I was reading, I was expecting something like your daughter coming home at midnight, maybe even being out of touch. As a mom and another person who watches the clock, I'm telling you that you need to loosen up a little. Also, swearing and yelling was not appropriate. You definitely had expectations that are too high, and it's really not your daughter's fault.", "What tf do you mean \u201cmight be the asshole\u201d YOU ARE THE FREAKING ASSHOLE. She was with her mother what did you think was going to happen? Even if you were to hate the mother of your children that much, are you really okay with having on your conscience if something were to happen to them if your daughter would\u2019ve just left them there? If so you\u2019re just damm spiteful. \n\nShe had contact with you throughout the entire night. You knew what she was. She wasn\u2019t ignoring your calls, She was not doing something illegal. Going from 0 to 100ike this is unreasonable. You\u2019re just a sad man, and a sad excuse for a father at that. I hope you\u2019re prepared for the lack of relationship your kids will have with you in the near future.", "You\u2019re such a joke. Seriously think about what you\u2019re mad at. You\u2019re mad that you don\u2019t have complete control. It could have been as easy as calling your daughter, asking where she was and coming to a compromise. OP, getting home at 10:02 is no different than arriving at 10:00 unless there is someone controlling and inconsiderate there waiting for you. Get over yourself.\n\nEdit to add: My dad was like this growing up and I moved out before I was 18 because I couldn\u2019t get away fast enough. If you value 12 minutes over your relationship with your daughter, she deserves so much better.", "YTA. OP at 16 your daughter isn't obliged to follow the custody agreement, she can choose to not live with you. You punished her for being with her mother. You should never make your kids choose between their parents because it is childish, petty and not what a good parent does. I feel very sorry for both of your daughters. Fully expect both to go LC or NC until they surface with your worst nightmare for a husband, bf or baby daddy.", "YTA \nWhat. The actual. Fuck?\n\nOkay let me get this right.\n\nYou yelled at your daughter, caused a scene WHILE SHE WAS FUCKING DRIVING, and then took away her car over FUCKING 12 MINUTES?!\n\nSir. This isn't about rules. Curfews exist to keep your children safe. The purpose is that you know where they are at night. \n\nYour daughter was with her mother. A responsible adult who was making sure she is save. You just called her so you knew she was okay (by the way, controll freak much???), then when your daughter didn't come in the *second* the curfew hit you blew up and yelled at her.\n\nNo 'are you okay?' no concern, no basic respect?\n\nAlso why would your daugher be expected to buy her sister a car?? The fuck??\n\nSir you claimed your wife \"wants to be their friend.\" No I think she's just not emotionally abusive and treats her children like human beings. Which annoys you because you seem to think your kids are objects for you to control. \n\nHonestly hope you will be happy once they go low contact with you and you rot alone and lonely in a retirement home. That's what you deserve judging by this post.", "So anyways have fun being lonely when your daughters move in with mom - YTA", "YTA have fun not being invited to your daughters wedding for being a bad father. Seriously what kind of man speaks to their own daughter like that!?! Grow up", "YTA. You\u2019re taking it out on your daughter that you hate your ex-wife. Stop it. She and her sister didn\u2019t ask to be put in the middle of your nasty divorce. You knew where she was, who she was with, and what she was doing. You chose to be a verbally abusive control freak instead of being the slightest bit patient. Get ready for your daughters to cut off all contact with you the second they turn 18 or as soon as a judge says it\u2019s okay for them to.

Get help.", "YTA.\n\nShe was with her mother. And she was only 12 minutes late! It\u2019s not like she was 3 hours late! Plus it was a weekend. Who the frick gives a 16 year old a 10:00 curfew on the weekend?\n\nI think I know who caused the divorce to be nasty based on this post. You scream and curse out your 16 year old. I mean, who the hell does that??? She was in touch with you the entire time, so it\u2019s not like you had anything to be worried about.\n\nJeez mate.

What caused you guy\u2019s to get divorced anyways?", "There is something seriously wrong with you, and I strongly suggest counseling- both individual and family.

But you clearly don\u2019t care either way", "YTA and you are mean.  You are obsessed with control and are happy to punish your kid for being kind to your ex.\n\nYou will end up alone if you keep going like this.  But hey, you'll be in control and the BIG BOSS OF THE HOUSE all by yourself, amirite?", "You were mad at your ex, so you took it out on your kid. Way to be a stereotype. YTA. Stop punishing your child because you hate your ex.", "YTA, for all the things that have already been said, but also for this:\n\nYou were looking for something to jump on. You called her at 9:45 to remind her to be home. What is that about? You know where she is, you know she's with her mother, and you still felt it was necessary to bull your way in to remind everyone *who's really in charge here*. Or at least, who you **think** should be in charge. Then you said 10:00 hit and \"by now I'm pretty frustrated\". By now. So you were frustrated before she was even due home. \n\nRun your house however you want, but just know that in 2 years, Lily will be so gone, and I bet Hannah will be, too. She'll have the car from her mom, and you won't have anything to hold her. \n\nYou are a pathetic hothead, and oh so absolutely the asshole.", "YTA. Your hate for your ex is obvious.

There is absolutely no reason to speak to your daughter like that. She was with her mother. She was being responsible. You're inflexible and non-understanding nature will not win you the respect you think is owed to you. \n\nNo wonder you are divorced. Your ex thinks you're an AH for a reason. Show her a little respect as well. She is the mother of your children. They have half her DNA. Grow up. Act like a father, not a screaming turd.", "YTA.

She was out with her mom. Your behavior was completely unacceptable.

She kept the same level of contact with you as she had been, would you still acted the same way.\n\nHonestly with your daughter being close to adulthood I'd really be looking at what type of relationship you want with her.  Once she is 18 there will be no 50/50 she will not be obligated by law to even be in your presence.  I'm not saying you should let your kid have a free for all, but your clearly knew where she was, with who and she kept good communication ie she wasn't hanging up on you. 15 minutes is nothing, you should give a small amount of leeway you never know what could happen, so to take away the car for that you kinda are YTA.", "YTA she was with her mom.

It was the weekend, not a school night. Ten is early for a 16 year old. Especially one who is out with a parent. Yelling and cursing is not a parenting technique.

You were being a vindictive tyrant, probably to get back at your ex-wife. That alone is major AH behavior, but on top of that, you took out your apparently uncontrollable anger on your daughter who was innocent in this. She was with a parent. She was engaging in responsible driving. She was communicating with you. She was trying to enjoy her night with food and trivia. She did absolutely nothing wrong. You are punishing her to punish her mother. You are punishing her to exert your authority blindly. You are the exact opposite parent everyone hopes to have.

You are brewing an estrangement at this rate.", "YTA.\n\nYou do not speak to anyone like this, especially your kids.  It's unbelievable that you would curse at your children.  You are not a healthy parent.  You need to make more of an effort to meet their mother halfway.  Your daughter was doing the responsible thing by making sure HER MOTHER made it home safely.  What are you teaching her?  She answered her phone.  She kept you informed.  She's a good kid.  You should have vented your frustrations at their mother, in a respectful way.  You need to have flexibility when it comes to parenting.\n\nInstead, you lost your shit and come off like an insane person.  You're angry - you're scary.  You are causing emotional damage.
