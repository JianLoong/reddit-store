We paid for 2 additional boats: 8pm and 10:30pm for anyone who couldn\u2019t party until early morning. \n\nMy sister messaged us prior to the wedding and told us she was trying to sort out her own private boat at 8pm as she had to get my young nieces to bed. We told her we could organise one for her, as we already had to get the photographer back at 8pm. She agreed. \n\nNote: she previously asked us to move our wedding date forward one week after we sent the Save the Date\u2019s out, because my niece was starting school after the wedding weekend. We had asked her input before we booked (specifically mentioning my nieces and school term times) and she told us to go ahead and book what we wanted, so we did, and we chose to not move the date as we\u2019d booked and let all of our guests know. I feel this has been an issue of contention ever since. \n\nBack to the wedding night: I started the dance floor music early so my nieces could dance with us before they left, and my sister and BIL really got into dancing with them. My wedding planner asked me who will be on the 8pm boat, I looked at my sister and said ah, my family but I\u2019m not sure which of them at the moment. - this was an error on my part, as I should have specified I didn\u2019t know if my parents would also leave with my sister. \n\nMy wedding planner then went on the DJ microphone and gave a notice that the first boat would leave in 10 minutes. My sisters family is still dancing but I don\u2019t ask them to stop and leave to get the boat. We eventually say bye. \n\nShe then suddenly makes a beeline for me across the dance floor with really angry eyes and says the boat left. I\u2019m like, what?? And she says yeah, YOU told your wedding planner you didn\u2019t think we were going. I then said, oh no, that\u2019s not what I said, and she says, am I STUCK here? I say, yes? Because I had no idea what to suggest on the spot, and she storms away from me. \n\nI speak to my wedding planner who is apologising profusely and saying she is calling around different boat companies to see if anyone can help. My nieces see me again and excitedly run up to me to hug me now that they\u2019re back, and my sister shouts GIRLS come on, and they move away from me and my planner. \n\nThat bit broke my heart. \n\nMy husband asked his family for cash as a new boat was available and sorted them out, meanwhile I cried in a toilet cubicle. \n\nShe messaged us both the next day saying hope we had a nice night, and I wished my niece a good first day of school in response. \n\nWe haven\u2019t really spoken since. I can\u2019t tell if she is mad at me, or is mad that I\u2019m possibly mad at her.

There seems to be a pattern in your sister\u2019s behavior you ask her what her needs are - the dates her daughters start school, the boat times. You accommodate those needs.  She then has a problem and needs an additional accommodation - wants you to move the wedding date, fails to notice the time when she knows the boat is leaving at 8 PM.  Then she gets mad for her own irresponsible behavior and failure to plan.\n\nShe needs to take responsibility for causing the problems in the first place", "NTA \n\nYour sister is, it\u2019s her fault the boat left without her, and she and her kids survived so it isn\u2019t even a huge deal. \n\n(Also, you need to grow a backbone.)", "NTA.  I really don't understand how adults old enough to have children can't learn to take responsibility for themselves. You have to learn how not to let it bother you when other people fail to take care of themselves. You had a lot more going on than your sister did.", "She\u2019s a grown woman, sure you could have taken her by the hand and gotten her to the boat but that is just foolish for a grown ass woman.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. You aren't responsible for your Sister missing the boat.. She's a grown Adult with Kids so doesn't need you as a caretaker on your Wedding Day. \n\nIt was her responsibility to get to the boat when the announcement was made by the Planner.", "NTA\nThe planner announced ten minutes before the boat left. Your sister and BIL are adults with ears. \n\nI'm with other commenters suggesting you look into therapy to help you disengage from the toxic dynamic where your sister creates problems and you feel obligated to solve them. She uses those \"problems\" as her excuse to treat you with rudeness and hostility. Your attempts to control her anger by inconveniencing yourself and violating your boundaries for safety and comfort in your relationships suggests this abusive dynamic is an established habit. \n\nAdults are responsible for managing and regulating our emotions. We CHOOSE behavior and which feelings to express, and how. No one can do that for another person. Making YOU feel responsible to \"fix\" another person's feelings is a pathway to manipulation and badly balanced relationships.\n\nTry to see your sister as the person she is, as shown through her actions. Not as a role, which carries entitlement to your time, energy, resources and compliance. She is not a very safe person for you. The proper reaction is stronger boundaries to keep her more distant from information and events she is likely to use to hurt you.", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult who knew what time the boat was leaving. Her not being prepared is not your fault.", "NTA but to be frank, you and your sister both sound ridiculous.  \n\nWhy would you let this ruin your wedding?  It seems very unfair to your husband and his family that they had to come up with money for a new boat because you and your sister were freaking out.  Also, it seems odd and unfair to your husband and guests that you were so upset over it that you left to cry in the bathroom.  \n\nMy advice is to see this situation as a sign that you need help with your anxiety.  Your sister does too.\n\nThis was your sister's sister's wedding.  It wouldn't have hurt the kids to be up late for this one night.  Also, it's absurd that you actually planned the wedding around your sister's kids' school schedule--and my job is in education at a competitive institution!  Can't believe your sister asked you to move the wedding.\n\nYou were not responsible for your sister's scheduling.  She knew when the boat would leave and chose to be dancing instead of paying attention.  Her attitude--she actually ruined your wedding because she was disorganized and neurotic about her kids' schedule!--is shocking.\n\nNo, it didn't \"break your heart\" that your sister told the girls to move away from you.  Don't add to the drama.  That said, your sister was very rude.  You owe your husband an apology and you need to put some serious thought into how to avoid being controlled by your sister and her anxiety in future.", "NTA \n\nYour sister had so many warnings plus she\u2019s an adult. Her oops wasn\u2019t your fault. She was just trying to nailed at you at something. Your sister is TA here. She was selfish.", "NTA\n\nIf the planner made the announcement then its your sisters fault for not getting her things and being ready. It sounds like she is making her mistake your fault.", "NTA she is an adult??? she is responsible for herself and her kids???? she also sounds like a selfish person and made a scene at YOUR wedding.", "NTA:  Your sister knew the boat was at 8PM, it was announced 10 minutes beforehand and your sister should have realized that was the moment to get going, not keep dancing for a while longer assuming the boat would be held for her.", "NTA. Does your sister have a habit of turning things about you into being about her? Does she frequently (as with the scheduling of the wedding date) say \"oh do what you want\", then when you do just that, gets upset or demands you change your plans to suit her? Is she habitually late and expects everyone to just wait for her to arrive? Because it sounds like she sabotaged herself here so that she could be upset and upset you in turn, or she expected the boat to wait for her to be ready to leave on her own time.\n\nThey knew the departure time, and the wedding planner had the DJ announce it. Did your sister expect you to interrupt your wedding and her dancing with a patronizing reminder about the boat? Knowing your sister, how do you think she would have reacted if you had done that?\n\nMaybe, if your sister is scatterbrained and this was a genuine mistake, you could have arranged for your wedding planner to give her a personal reminder, but given how she danced right through the DJ announcement, it sounds like she expected that boat to wait for her, or she wanted to miss it. Given how she immediately blamed you instead of herself, it sounds like she's accustomed to not having to take responsibility for herself.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding, I hope the rest of the day was everything you wanted it to be.", "INFO - who lied, the wedding planner or your sister?\nWhy are you too scared to ring your sister and sort it out if you're so upset you've made a reddit post\n\nIt's too late now, but whose going back on which boat really shouldn't be something you should have to deal with while celebrating your marriage.

As the person who made a huge deal about needing to be on that specific boat, she needed to have done her part, such as pay attention to the announcements, set an alarm, harangue the person handling the boats to make certain her family is on it. \n\nYour job was to enjoy your wedding and have the best night.", "You mentioned to your sister about the 8pm boat before hand, the wedding planner gave a 10minute warning and still your sister missed the boat. \n\nNTA", "NTA- but i think you  need to be more up front about how you feel.

Especially as an announcement was made and heard by all guests.", "NTA your sister's  a drama queen.   \n\nShe can't miss 1 bedtime for her sister's wedding.\n\nShe sounds like a narcissist.", "You had had enough on your plate seeing as it was your wedding day and so much of the organization was on you. Making sure she got out on time was her responsibility. NTA", "Eh you should've said specifically your sister, but still NTA. There was an announcement, she can't claim she didn't know the boat was leaving.", "YTA \n\nSo is your wedding planner, but she's not part if the judgement here.\n\nFirst of all, you had a wedding in a venue where your guests were literally captive and unable to leave except at set times, which is just kind of obnoxious to begin with. What if someone got really sick or hurt themselves? They'd just be stuck there for hours? \n\nBut even if we put aside the hypotheticals . . .\n\nFirst of all, knowing that your guests only had one way off the island or would have to wait literally for HOURS for their next chance to leave, your wedding planner made a single announcement, only minutes before they had to be at the boat? And you don't even say if they even bothered to turn the music down. It can be nearly impossible to hear people clearly on a mic at the best of times. If there was music playing, I know I wouldn't have had any idea what was being said unless she repeated herself multiple times, and I still probably would have had to ask someone to clarify.  One announcement with only 10 minutes' notice, while people were busy and distracted dancing? AHs. \n\nSecondly, your sister told you MULTIPLE TIMES ahead of time that she wanted to leave at 8. So you were well aware. Your nieces are young, and had school the next day. This was not an arbitrary thing. You even admit that you should have said something to the wedding planner when she asked who was meant to be on the 8 o'clock boat and you didn't bother to say, \"My sister definitely wants to leave then with her kids\" - because then she could have ensured that it didn't leave without them. \n\nInstead, you not only didn't bother to mention them even though you KNEW that she needed to be on that boat . . . you watched them miss the announcement and keep dancing, and didn't bother to go say something to her. It would have taken literally ONE MOMENT to say, \"Hey, they just announced the boat leaving in a few minutes, hon! I wanted to make sure you didn't miss it because it seems like you didn't hear.\" You just stood there and did absolutely nothing knowing that they'd be stuck there for hours. Did your brain break?\n\nRedditors are undoubtedly going to say that your sister was responsible for watching the time or whatever. But your sister isn't the person who stranded her wedding guests on an island with limited means of leaving in the first place. If you're going to do that, you're responsible for making proper announcements and ensuring that people hear them and that boats don't leave without them when you've been told ahead of time. YTA.", ">she was trying to sort out her own private boat at 8pm...We told her we could organise one for her\n\nINFO:  So you had a \"general guest\" boat already scheduled for 8pm, and then you also told your sister you would schedule a separate additional 8pm boat for her?\n\nIf that's the case, then the announcement wouldn't have even applied to her.  **Her private boat should have been waiting regardless.**", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd have bags and kids at the ready for 7.30 and start making my way out/saying goodbyes. She not only ignored the 10 min call she totally noped out of organising herself. She either expected them to wait for her or have someone organise her night. You helped sort the boat, after that she is in charge of sorting herself and kids and leaving on time. She knew what time it was due to arrive- the time she wanted to leave! Really don't get why she's mad at you, sounds like she's one of those people who won't admit fault or blame and have to find someone else to be the bad guy", "NTA. I assume your sister knows how to tell time?  An announcement was made about the boat leaving in 10 minutes.  She ignored it.  You snooze, you lose.", "NTA she's an adult that wants to leave earlier than everyone else, you accommodated that, she can keep an eye on her watch herself. It was your wedding day you shouldn't have been worried about a grown adult keeping an eye on the time.", "NTA -- it's not your job to keep track of time for your sister during YOUR wedding. That's her job. She sounds entitled by the demands she makes of you. Let her be mad. It's not your job to pamper her emotions either.", "If you can\u2019t afford therapy embark on a self-guided mental health regime.  Item #1: deliberately piss of your sister at least once a month.", "How is your sister being an intentional asshole your fault?  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It sounds that you are a people pleaser and let people walk all over you. How is this your fault? If your sister was so interested in the 8 pm boat she shouldlve been por attentive. Work on your anxiety OP, its sad you cried on your wedding day over this. I send you lots of hugs!", "NTA it\u2019s her own fault? She\u2019s a baby", "I\u2019m confused.  You said you organized two additional boats - 8pm an 1030pm - for people who couldn\u2019t party until the wee hours.  You then said you would arrange a private boat for your sister at 8pm.  You then did not arrange the private boat and did not tell her that she was expected to join the other boat.\n\nYTA", "I would have let her wait I\u2019m not sure why an error on her part cause you to have an emergency", "You need to learn to not be bothered by things out of your control.\n\nThey shouted on the mic, you sister has a phone/watch, everyone was alerted of the three boat times \n\nYour sister messed up, not you\nStop allowing her to place blame for her own disorganisation", "NAH - maybe depending to what degree she lost it in the moment, and obviously that it left you crying is shit. Kinda just seems like an unfortunate scenario, she must have been worried and not knowing what to do in the moment (would there even have been space on the 10.30 as a result?) before your husband sorted it, a not finest moment but potentially not AH sort of thing IMO, especially given the text the next day.\n\nDid you reply? I'd suggest one way or another to make the next move, maybe don't even need to address the issue specifically, it's just eating at you and potentially built up more than necessary, worrying about nothing now. Maybe she doesn't even realise how much she upset you, thought you just had a brief mini argument/clash but it all worked out in the end? Don't let it keep you down I mean really.", "NTA Your sister is ridiculous. Sounds like she expects the world to revolve around her.", "NTA.  It was your sister\u2019s responsibility to be on the boat in time.  She sounds high maintenance.  Take a long break from her.  I think you\u2019ll find your life is a less stressful without her in it.", "i'm sorry she made you feel bas on your wedding day NTA and hope you could have fun despite this", "Absolute NTA. your sister can kick rocks.", "NTA. Your sister knew she and her family had to get a boat. Up to them to ensure they are there for it. Not up to you to run around after grown adults on your wedding day. They ignored the announcement so tough luck. \n\nYou can do one of two things here:\n\n1. Ignore it, keep calm and carry on, or\n\n2. Take the bull by the horns and tell her you want to talk to her about it.", ">hold the boat \n\nI have no idea why, but this phrase is killing me right now. Agreed with the NTA judgement though.", "Both moms missed the cutting the cake announcement at my sister's wedding, despite a loud announcement and everyone moving towards the cake.  They were busy talking and having a good time.  Oh well.  Life moves on.  Their fault if anyone's.\n\nSister could have set twelve phone alarms to get her out on time.  She didn't.  Announcement was made.  Her fault.", "[removed]", "I mean, that's a pretty big assumption, and jumps straight to the snarkiest, most obnoxious possible conclusion (not surprising on Reddit, mind you).\n\nIt's just as possible that the sister literally didn't hear the announcement. OP says that the sister was busy dancing with her kids, and doesn't indicate that they actually turned off the (likely loud) music that people were dancing to when the wedding planner grabbed the mic. I often don't hear amplified speech through microphones clearly. She might have thought the wedding planner was just making a congratulatory comment or who knows what.\n\nHonestly, both OP and the wedding planner are the AHs.\n\nIf you have people basically captive in your venue and unable to leave without assistance, you don't make a single announcement only minutes before they have to be at the boat, knowing that it will be HOURS before they'll have another opportunity to go. AND they didn't even go check with the person/people who had young kids if they had heard the announcement, despite OP knowing that her sister wanted to leave early. That's ridiculously irresponsible and thoughtless.", "It sounds like she wants special service \u2014 like she interpreted OP saying that she\u2019d organize a boat as meaning there would be a boat specifically for them, and ignored the call for the early boat because she thought she\u2019d have her own (or it was primarily designated for her) so it would wait for her. (That boat was instead originally for the photographer, who needed to be returned to the mainland on time not hanging around for her.) She\u2019s bad at communication and expects OP to have read her mind and accommodated her by magic.", "[removed]", "Classic passive-aggressive IMO", "Working on that last bit, thanks lol.", "Thank you - definitely working on that..", "since xkcd bot isn't around here, I'll help out:\n\n>a ~~grown-ass woman.~~\n\ngrown ass-woman", "Even if there had been no announcement. Can't she tell the time?", "I've never heard of someone leaving their sister's wedding at 8pm to get kids to bed. In my country, the wedding meal wouldn't be finished by 8pm, never mind the DJ getting started! Children stay up late at weddings, it doesn't do them any harm.", "Thank you for saying this. Sister was terrible, but OP simply crumpled.", "This is incredibly unkind to OP. She is allowed to feel emotions, and shaming a bride for having heightened emotions ON HER WEDDING DAY is cruel.", "No, clearly her sister needs her own boat. /s", "The sister knew what time the boat was leaving. She was there when the announcement was made. She\u2019s a grown ass woman and shouldn\u2019t need her hand held to know when she needs to be somewhere. Also nobody forced anyone to go to the wedding. If being trapped on a island for a few hours is a dealbreaker then send your regrets. It also sounds like a new boat was sourced fairly quickly at OP\u2019s expense. That\u2019s way more than I would have done. If I need to be on a boat at 8pm I\u2019m responsible for getting my ass on that boat.", "Terrible take.", "Yeah that's dumb.\n\nThey're adults who chose to attend the island wedding. It wasn't a court summons.\n\nNTA and the sister is an idiot.", "> But your sister isn't the person who stranded her wedding guests on an island with limited means of leaving in the first place.\n\nSTRANDED them!\n\nShoved them on the SS Minnow and laughed from the dock as she watched it sail away, knowing that it would soon beach itself, with no one coming to their rescue for YEARS.\n\nShe's practically a supervillain.", "But wasn\u2019t it the sister\u2019s responsibility to catch the leaving boat? They already moved the wedding date for the sister once which is insanely accommodating.", "First, places like that have emergency ferries so stop playing ignorant about safety measures. It\u2019s 2023, not 1963. However they were obviously unavailable to the sister because \u201cschool the next day\u201d is not an emergency. So yes, put your hypothetical straw man away, he has no place here.\n\nFirst (again), OP clarified that the music was cut when the ferry announcement was made. Your aural issues (which may not apply to OP\u2019s sister) don\u2019t apply here.\n\nSecond, that\u2019s nope city. NO ONE should be babysitting ANYONE else at their wedding. That\u2019s the one day where a person should be able to just have a really lovely time and not worry about who\u2019s doing this or that. Keeping her departure time is solely the sister\u2019s purview, not the bride\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re the sister or just as entitled as the sister but this take is so wrong.", "\n\n>Did your brain break?\n\ndid yours? this take is terrible", "Because there was already one been organised for the wedding photographer - literally stated just after you cut the quote off. They never said a private boat that would be waiting on hand for when sister decided it was with the wedding photographer.", "So you think the plan was that OP bought *two* boats that would both leave at 8pm instead of just buying one and having that one be for their sis, the photographer, and possibly anyone else who wanted to leave that early? Bc buying 2 boats instead of one when they would both leave at the same time seems like a waste of money to me.", "I immediately thought Game of Thrones. Hold the door -> Hodor.

It's one night, NTA, they all can build a bridge and get the fuck over it", "The wedding planner got on the DJ microphone and announced the boat would be leaving and it was 8pm.", "You need to realise that she made you cry on your wedding night.

Bc it makes a lot of sense to me that the only 8pm boat OP mentions arranging was for the photographer, the sister, and (ostensibly) anyone else who wanted to leave at 8. Bc it doesn't make sesne that OP would have a general boat going out at 8 and then set up a private one just for a select few ppl at that exact time-maybe OP is different, but I would just arrange *one* boat to leave at 8 and let guests know. Why waste your money buying 2 boats to go out at the same time, right?", "Ok, I agreed with everything until you wished the daughter to cry. The daughter is a child and not at fault, and if sister lacks empathy for her daughter the same way she lacks empathy for OP, then I doubt it will do much to the person actually at fault.
