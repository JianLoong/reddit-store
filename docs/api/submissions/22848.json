She moved into my place only a month ago because my previous roommate decided to move out of state. I did not know she was a woman because she has a gender neutral name and my previous roommate found her while I was out of town.\n\nAdmittedly I have only lived with men before but I had no issue with having a female roommate. She seemed friendly and nice so at first it seemed alright however as I observed her habits, idk I just found somethings a bit icky, like how she eats loads of cottage cheese, how different she seems when not dressed up, feet on the couch etc.\n\nRecently she told me she wanted to install a bidet attachment to our toilet. I find the idea of that extremely disgusting, I can imagine ass water rebounding and splashing all over, not to mention period and vaginal discharge. I told her no and mentioned how disgusting it was due to splash back. She argued a little but agreed to not do it.\n\nHowever now she is being less friendly. And based on what I hear when she is in the bathroom I feel like she might be using the shower to clean up sometimes. This makes me feel a bit more icky as now I am imagining contaminated water in the tub and her moist ass sitting on the couches and armchairs causing them to absorb her fluids. It has been over a week and she is still more distant, we used to watch movies and stuff together and I do miss that a little, and things feel awkward just because I said no.\n\nAITA here? Everyone uses toilet paper here and it feels like the more sanitary option.", "created_utc": 1689986589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1565fav/aita_for_refusing_to_allow_my_roommate_to_install/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, the way you mentioned vaginal discharge with this is fucking weird.", "Holy fuck... Yeah YTA\n\nFor one, someone else's hygiene habits are none of your fucking business.

Get over it.\n\nAlso I'm sorry, but in what world is putting your feet on a couch or chair an abnormal thing to do? Like I've literally never in my life met a person who never sits with their feet curled up underneath them. \n\nAlso bidets are literally more sanitary than toilet paper bud.\n\nAlso it's *women*, or *woman*, not \"female\".

You're lucky she wants one and you get to enjoy it. And the thing about bidets is you don't have to use it if you dont' want to. Don't want to use it? Lift up the toilet lid and have a piss. You have to hit buttons to activate the bidet. Long term, it saves money on toilet paper and surprise, it saves you from getting hemorrhoids.   \n\n\nAlso, you sound like you have some serious ideas on what women are and aren't.

Isn't this why we bathe/shower?   I'm sorry being a human being is gross for you.

Hella mommy issues coming out here", "YTA. It\u2019s a bidet not a water rocket. There\u2019s not *that* much splash back. And it leaves your ass much, much cleaner.", "YTA for jumping to baseless assumptions. (32M) here.  I've installed a bidet *because* it is a faster, more hygienic, and paper efficient way of cleaning my literal asshole.   The device just aims a stream of water so that feces falls to the water below.  You are supposed to remain sitting on it.  It's not for vaginas so if that is the only reason you brought up her genitals or her sex/gender then I don't see the relevance.  \n\n\nFurthermore, you still need to wipe afterwards to see if it did the job let alone because you have to absorb the water.With that being said, you could have benefitted from saying something like \"so I don't know much about bidets. How do they work?\" or \"I really don't want to say yes to something I don't truly know a lot about first.\" if you felt that transparency was key.   This is what communication is for.  Even a discrete \"Oh, that's a good question. Can I get back to you on that?\" before you look into it on YouTube.  I say this because you seem confident in your stance but it's off base and not from experience.\n\nI assure you that they're a gamechanger.  I've got some conditions that correlate with guttural/digestive health so all the more I am grateful that my asshole is clean, my toilet is clean, my toilet paper budget is down, and I have begun to *miss my toilet* if I have to shit in public.  \n\nNow would there would have been valid concerns like whether either of you are comfortable handling the installation process yourselves? For what it's worth, you close the valve behind your toilet the same way you close the valve for your faucet. No plumbing skills required.   \n\nOr perhaps the landlord needs to be making other repairs first to the supply hose or the toilet tank valve? The latter I had to contend with- in that case DO NOT TOUCH IT UNTIL THE REPAIR IS DONE.\n\nLastly, let's address the concern you had about splashback. Unless you didn't understand that you are seated for the entire use of the bidet, a reasonable way of handling that is you could have crossed that bridge when you got there by saying \"Hey, I'm noticing water droplets after you use the bathroom. Please be mindful of that going forward\" and then take issue with whether it continues.  \n\n\nWith all of that being said, I hope you consider that it's not because you said \"no\" or because you stood your ground.  You might need to elaborate a bit with us on what exactly she said before she gave up on it.  Did she give valid reasons that didn't match up with your imagined concerns?", "YTA\n\nIf you want to walk around with dirty cheeks while smelling like ass that's your choice, even if she gets one you dont have to use it duh, but to freak out over someone who wants clean buns is wild af\n\nHow dare she clean herself properly lmfao", "YTA.

Being weirded out that microscopic poop particles could land on your tp (higher chance of that happening when you flush with the lid open, OP). It also sounds germaphobic when you get weirded out that she cleans herself in the shower, again a perfectly normal activity to do and arguably the reason a shower was created. \n\nCan you find ways to start reeling back the 'ickiness' feeling? Put the TP in a shelf above the toilet to reduce potential spray. Have specific towels for drying oneself or if you find that weird, just be okay with the idea of her using the toilet paper for drying. Can you leave out Lysol wipes or some kind of antibacterial wipe for you to use on your toilet to make yourself feel less contaminated? It would be obviously too much to expect HER to wipe down the toilet after every use since she's being extremely hygienic using a bidet, but YOU could for your own comfort. Same with the shower, have an antibacterial spray that you use on the shower and just hose it down before using. It creates extra steps for you which means more work, but it might help you be comfortable. \n\nIt sounds like you're in a learning curve OP, and good on you for admitting you don't know much about bidets and committing to learning about them.

She moved into my place only a month ago because my previous roommate decided to move out of state. I did not know she was a woman because she has a gender neutral name and my previous roommate found her while I was out of town.\n\nAdmittedly I have only lived with men before but I had no issue with having a female roommate. She seemed friendly and nice so at first it seemed alright however as I observed her habits, idk I just found somethings a bit icky, like how she eats loads of cottage cheese, how different she seems when not dressed up, feet on the couch etc.\n\nRecently she told me she wanted to install a bidet attachment to our toilet. I find the idea of that extremely disgusting, I can imagine ass water rebounding and splashing all over, not to mention period and vaginal discharge. I told her no and mentioned how disgusting it was due to splash back. She argued a little but agreed to not do it.\n\nHowever now she is being less friendly. And based on what I hear when she is in the bathroom I feel like she might be using the shower to clean up sometimes. This makes me feel a bit more icky as now I am imagining contaminated water in the tub and her moist ass sitting on the couches and armchairs causing them to absorb her fluids. It has been over a week and she is still more distant, we used to watch movies and stuff together and I do miss that a little, and things feel awkward just because I said no.\n\nAITA here? Everyone uses toilet paper here and it feels like the more sanitary option.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
