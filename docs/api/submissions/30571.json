If you need to comment or have questions read the comments I wish you all the best and thank your your input!! \n\nThis is long but\u2026 For some context: my partner and I got together 4 years ago. I was child free and he had one kid 8f from a previous marriage. 8f was 4 when we got together.\n\nI immediately took on caring for her for half a year bc her mom needed to \u201cget her stuff together\u201d after a bad relationship and I WFH so it made sense. \nAll of that to say; since she was 4 I have taken an active role in parenting/nurturing her even when I was told I\u2019m not her mother and have no say even though I did/do 99% of her care and needs when she is with us.\nI got pregnant quick (4 months together) \nAnd had my first 3f and then my second 1m when my first was 8 months old.\nWhen I found out I was pregnant I immediately started a savings account and routed money to there every pay period. Once I got pregnant again I doubled the amount so that my kids could have an equal amount.  I told my partner about this in passing but he didnt really care. He doesn\u2019t contribute to the account it\u2019s only me and I\u2019m the only one with access. \nWe talked about it again months later and I asked him if he and her mother started saving for her and he said they hadn\u2019t discussed it or ever started anything. I said he probably should since as her mother isn\u2019t reliable in terms of money and our two will in fact be given that money after graduation and I don\u2019t want any animosity over it. He said that\u2019s true and we left it at that. \nI  don\u2019t ask questions bc she\u2019s not my kid as I have been told so I never mentioned it again. \n\nThe topic came up after seeing a TikTok while I was hanging out with friends and I said my kids both have accounts and money specifically set up for them. They asked about my bonus daughter and I said; I will ensure she is safe, fed, and knows she is loved when she is with us but she\u2019s not my child or my responsibility so why would I take away from my bio kids to give to her when she has 2 parents that can do for her what I do for mine alone? I got some push back that if I accepted him than that means I accept her and should do and treat her like I birthed her too. \n\nI agree which is why I make it a point to buy her what I buy my kids and treat her as such when she\u2019s with us. Most strangers don\u2019t know she\u2019s not mine unless we tell them. But I don\u2019t see why I have to do what her parents don\u2019t care to..\n\nTLDR: friends think I\u2019m TA for not including my bonus daughter in a savings account I created for my bio kids before they were born even after being told I\u2019m not her parent and have no say. Her parents don\u2019t care to do it themselves for her and I\u2019m the sole contributor to the savings account for mine. \n\nSo Reddit AITA?\n\nEdit Adding after a few hours:\nI noticed these issues come up a lot;\n1. My bonus daughter is not treated any differently by me. She is loved, happy, and always excited when it\u2019s our time with her. She doesn\u2019t want to go home but we can\u2019t keep her until the judge decides so we take her back to her mom as instructed. We talk daily and I adore her like my own kids. This post wasn\u2019t about how I treat her bc I treat her great. It was about money and SPOILER she is 8 years old. Money isn\u2019t on her radar right now so I have time to make a decision on starting an account for her if I feel like doing so. Shame on you all and I\u2019m sorry if your step parent didn\u2019t give af about but please don\u2019t project that onto my situation.  Money doesn\u2019t equate to love. Nor does it mean I love her any less. \n2. Dad is active in all 3 lives. He works from 7-5:30 every day but when he\u2019s home he FaceTimes 8f to hang out while he takes care of the kids so I can get my own time and do whatever else. He pays for all of the children\u2019s expenses and would fully pay mine if I let him. This isn\u2019t about what he does or doesn\u2019t do this is about a savings account based off a conversation I had with my friend group. \n3. I will be talking to him tonight about opening a secret savings account her mother doesn\u2019t know about in order to ensure she isn\u2019t left out when the time comes and they\u2019re all of age. \nThank you everyone for your feedback!!! \n", "created_utc": 1699459251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qosu3/aita_bc_i_dont_have_a_savings_account_for_my/", "score": 1664, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Right or wrong, she's probably going to look to you for it. I think a serious finance conversation needs to be had between you. You don't mention how financially stable your family is but, the most obvious route to me is that another account is opened and he matches the content of the other 2 accounts then between the 2 of you, monthly payments are made to all 3.

Sadly, that marriage didn't work out and they got divorced a few years ago. My sister or either of our family had been in contact with her since then, because of her father (which sucks because bio or not, for me she was a niece as well)  Imagine if in that situation, she would have been doing the same and saving money for her, only to go NC after all that time. And you are totally right, sometimes In those cases, you are burdened with all the obligations but no say or right to decide anything because those are up to their bio parents that can get quite hostile when things don't work out.

They are not contributing funds to your children, and the reverse should be true as well.

People who think she's wrong are mostly saying -- and I checked to be sure -- that OP has an obligation to this kid and is acting as a parent to her and that treating her differently than her bio kids isn't reasonable if she's acting as the girl's primary parent.\n\nTo me, this is pretty equitable to the scenarios where a man parents a kid of years and then fucks right off after years of raising them and then gets slapped with a support order and complains about having to support a kid that 'isn't theirs.' You buy the ticket, you take the ride. Either you are a parent to the kid, or you aren't. And in that context, I care far more about the situation *de facto* than I do about the situation *de jure.*\n\nOP is a parent to this kid and I think it's a reasonable thing to say it's not acceptable to discharge that responsibility to the girl's other parents who aren't doing anything about it, and wash you hands of it.\n\nThe problem is, just because this girl has biological parents who should *also* be saving, doesn't mean OP is justified in treating a child she is very clearly raising differently from her biological kids. And I'm willing to accept people's downvotes for saying so. If OP is raising this child, and that seems to be very much the case, I think she has an obligation to her. If she isn't going to save for the kid equally with her other kids, she at least needs to be advocating for her *persistently* to her bio parents - one of whom is OP's own partner - to do so, even if it adds stress to her life and relationship. To discharge the responsibility to her partner and then just quietly accept it when her partner does nothing -- that doesn't sit well with me and I'd say that's a YTA.\n\nThe person on the other side isn't her husband who isn't saving - he sucks. It's the innocent girl who will grow up with a woman acting like her mother only to find very objective evidence as she enters adulthood - or her siblings do - that she never really felt that way.\n\nPeople aren't picking the softer person to harass. They are giving an honest assessment of OP's choices to OP -- who came here and asked for it. Their assessment might differ from yours, regarding OP's responsibilities, but to frame that as people attacking her while giving other people who aren't here asking for judgement a pass is just willful ignorance and mischaracterizing what's happening on this sub.", "Oh I don\u2019t ask him to contribute bc (stated the long and short way in other comments) \nI grew up dirt poor and he didn\u2019t.

Then we build the invest habit by going over stocks and mutual funds. The easy thing to do with mutual funds is some Fidelity S&P index.

Yes, money can sometimes go down 20% in a few days, but these are the best firms in the economy, if they stay down then everything must come down with it and your stocks will hold value (same thing happened in the great depression, stocks went way down, but if you sold at bottom, you could buy more cars/houses/goods with them than you could at the top).\n\nWell, our kids got really excited about Tesla years ago and so invested a lot of their accounts into it.

Our kids got excited about Tesla quite early and we let them put way more than we thought should go in, so in late 2019 they made investments of around $15K each ... our \"poorest\" kid is already worth more than $160K at which point we got them to diversify into index mutual funds.\n\n3) We have a verbal agreement that this money is for them, they must get a prenup if they get married keeping this money in their name, this isn't to fund the spouse. This money may be invested in a house or other real estate one day as they see fit.\n\n4) They won't use this money for anything else until age 52. We want them, as they get older to be increasingly secure financially, to continue working, saving, and investing. I and my wife did this. My wife has not worked for years, she's a very good investor (her father started her at age 4). Her stock dividends are now $160K/year. I saved/invested and so felt confident starting businesses. Some did very well so I could have retired at age 50.
