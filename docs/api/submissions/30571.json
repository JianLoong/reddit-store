I was child free and he had one kid 8f from a previous marriage. 8f was 4 when we got together.\n\nI immediately took on caring for her for half a year bc her mom needed to \u201cget her stuff together\u201d after a bad relationship and I WFH so it made sense. \nAll of that to say; since she was 4 I have taken an active role in parenting/nurturing her even when I was told I\u2019m not her mother and have no say even though I did/do 99% of her care and needs when she is with us.\nI got pregnant quick (4 months together) \nAnd had my first 3f and then my second 1m when my first was 8 months old.\nWhen I found out I was pregnant I immediately started a savings account and routed money to there every pay period. Once I got pregnant again I doubled the amount so that my kids could have an equal amount.  I told my partner about this in passing but he didnt really care. He doesn\u2019t contribute to the account it\u2019s only me and I\u2019m the only one with access. \nWe talked about it again months later and I asked him if he and her mother started saving for her and he said they hadn\u2019t discussed it or ever started anything. I said he probably should since as her mother isn\u2019t reliable in terms of money and our two will in fact be given that money after graduation and I don\u2019t want any animosity over it. He said that\u2019s true and we left it at that. \nI  don\u2019t ask questions bc she\u2019s not my kid as I have been told so I never mentioned it again. \n\nThe topic came up after seeing a TikTok while I was hanging out with friends and I said my kids both have accounts and money specifically set up for them. They asked about my bonus daughter and I said; I will ensure she is safe, fed, and knows she is loved when she is with us but she\u2019s not my child or my responsibility so why would I take away from my bio kids to give to her when she has 2 parents that can do for her what I do for mine alone? I got some push back that if I accepted him than that means I accept her and should do and treat her like I birthed her too. \n\nI agree which is why I make it a point to buy her what I buy my kids and treat her as such when she\u2019s with us. Most strangers don\u2019t know she\u2019s not mine unless we tell them. But I don\u2019t see why I have to do what her parents don\u2019t care to..\n\nTLDR: friends think I\u2019m TA for not including my bonus daughter in a savings account I created for my bio kids before they were born even after being told I\u2019m not her parent and have no say. Her parents don\u2019t care to do it themselves for her and I\u2019m the sole contributor to the savings account for mine. \n\nSo Reddit AITA?\n\nEdit Adding after a few hours:\nI noticed these issues come up a lot;\n1. My bonus daughter is not treated any differently by me. She is loved, happy, and always excited when it\u2019s our time with her. She doesn\u2019t want to go home but we can\u2019t keep her until the judge decides so we take her back to her mom as instructed. We talk daily and I adore her like my own kids. This post wasn\u2019t about how I treat her bc I treat her great. It was about money and SPOILER she is 8 years old. Money isn\u2019t on her radar right now so I have time to make a decision on starting an account for her if I feel like doing so. Shame on you all and I\u2019m sorry if your step parent didn\u2019t give af about but please don\u2019t project that onto my situation.  Money doesn\u2019t equate to love. Nor does it mean I love her any less. \n2. Dad is active in all 3 lives. He works from 7-5:30 every day but when he\u2019s home he FaceTimes 8f to hang out while he takes care of the kids so I can get my own time and do whatever else. He pays for all of the children\u2019s expenses and would fully pay mine if I let him. This isn\u2019t about what he does or doesn\u2019t do this is about a savings account based off a conversation I had with my friend group. \n3. I will be talking to him tonight about opening a secret savings account her mother doesn\u2019t know about in order to ensure she isn\u2019t left out when the time comes and they\u2019re all of age. \nThank you everyone for your feedback!!! \n", "created_utc": 1699459251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qosu3/aita_bc_i_dont_have_a_savings_account_for_my/", "score": 316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Right or wrong, she's probably going to look to you for it. I think a serious finance conversation needs to be had between you. You don't mention how financially stable your family is but, the most obvious route to me is that another account is opened and he matches the content of the other 2 accounts then between the 2 of you, monthly payments are made to all 3.

She raised her during 10 years since she was 8 and was the only thing she knew for a mother during this time, since her bio mum was out of the picture since she was 4. Sadly, that marriage didn't work out and they got divorced a few years ago. My sister or either of our family had been in contact with her since then, because of her father (which sucks because bio or not, for me she was a niece as well)  Imagine if in that situation, she would have been doing the same and saving money for her, only to go NC after all that time. And you are totally right, sometimes In those cases, you are burdened with all the obligations but no say or right to decide anything because those are up to their bio parents that can get quite hostile when things don't work out.

Obviously, they are both a bit selfish in that they would rather keep their funds to themselves, but if not together, they should each be saving a bit for her. They are not contributing funds to your children, and the reverse should be true as well. I would periodically gently remind your partner of this, she will need education and other things as she grows, and putting regular sums of whatever size aside regularly will make that bite smaller, and actually his daughter will likely not resent you, but her parents..", "NTA.

It would not be about the money, it would be about doubting the place I truly have in her life. Setting something aside for her would come from your love for her while still \"staying in your lane.\" You say that his benefit to the three of them is after he dies but yours is while you live but yours is only for two of three kids.

She has two other parents who should be doing this for her, and it absolutely should not be your responsibility.\n\nYou've already taken her in and cared for her and made sure she is loved and looked after and all her needs are met.

People who think she's wrong are mostly saying -- and I checked to be sure -- that OP has an obligation to this kid and is acting as a parent to her and that treating her differently than her bio kids isn't reasonable if she's acting as the girl's primary parent.\n\nTo me, this is pretty equitable to the scenarios where a man parents a kid of years and then fucks right off after years of raising them and then gets slapped with a support order and complains about having to support a kid that 'isn't theirs.' You buy the ticket, you take the ride. Either you are a parent to the kid, or you aren't. And in that context, I care far more about the situation *de facto* than I do about the situation *de jure.*\n\nOP is a parent to this kid and I think it's a reasonable thing to say it's not acceptable to discharge that responsibility to the girl's other parents who aren't doing anything about it, and wash you hands of it.\n\nThe problem is, just because this girl has biological parents who should *also* be saving, doesn't mean OP is justified in treating a child she is very clearly raising differently from her biological kids. And I'm willing to accept people's downvotes for saying so. If OP is raising this child, and that seems to be very much the case, I think she has an obligation to her. If she isn't going to save for the kid equally with her other kids, she at least needs to be advocating for her *persistently* to her bio parents - one of whom is OP's own partner - to do so, even if it adds stress to her life and relationship. To discharge the responsibility to her partner and then just quietly accept it when her partner does nothing -- that doesn't sit well with me and I'd say that's a YTA.\n\nThe person on the other side isn't her husband who isn't saving - he sucks. It's the innocent girl who will grow up with a woman acting like her mother only to find very objective evidence as she enters adulthood - or her siblings do - that she never really felt that way.\n\nPeople aren't picking the softer person to harass. They are giving an honest assessment of OP's choices to OP -- who came here and asked for it. Their assessment might differ from yours, regarding OP's responsibilities, but to frame that as people attacking her while giving other people who aren't here asking for judgement a pass is just willful ignorance and mischaracterizing what's happening on this sub.", "Oh I don\u2019t ask him to contribute bc (stated the long and short way in other comments) \nI grew up dirt poor and he didn\u2019t. I always told myself if/when I had kids I\u2019d create an account for them to give them a head start, It was something I needed to do for myself for my kids. He can contribute if he wants to but it\u2019s not an obligation. My brain focuses on disaster/bad scenarios whereas he is an in the moment type of person and doesn\u2019t worry too much about what\u2019s ahead bc \u201cwhatever happens is going to happen regardless.\u201d", "Never assume when it comes to death and money!! He could lose all his money tomorrow and you could pass tomorrow- situations can change overnight so put all insurances in place now the way you want them", "I genuinely do not see her as a burden. She is such an amazing girl. Smart, sweet, caring. I genuinely have tried to do the best I possibly could by her bc she deserves so much. This is the one thing I didn\u2019t step up on bc I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s fair that her mom Allows me to take care of their child but I have no say and am not considered a parental figure. I do everything I can (as explained in a comment with details) to make her feel loved, wanted, and a part of the family but I feel like taking on the financial obligation of a savings account when they established that boundary doesn\u2019t make sense. \nHer dad has talked to mom about it but she can and will keep her away if he fights too much so it\u2019s easier to just let things be as they are while we work to get permanent custody.", "I'm sorry to hear about that. I hope in sharing your perspective, OP understands the damage she is doing so someone she considers her own child.", "This is an excellent idea. Bonus girly won\u2019t feel like the one that didn\u2019t matter. Bio parents can\u2019t touch it. If something happens between you and dad you can just move the money to your bio kids account.", "It makes sense of why you\u2019re saving up for your kids but it doesn\u2019t make sense why he\u2019s not. You don\u2019t have to have grown up in poverty to understand that getting some money for school or to move out on your own is extremely helpful.", "I don't think this makes any sense as a reason to a) not ask him to contribute, b) him not contributing. Just because you had different backgrounds doesn't mean college isn't expensive, that he might not be able to work forever, that either of you could have a life-altering injury tomorrow. He also NEEDS to plan, that's part of being an adult. If you already have a shared account why not budget so he's putting money into three college funds too??", "You\u2019ve said that a few times as though you really believe that him not growing up poor makes it impossible for him to understand. \n\nIt is really strange. You are together and share children but aren\u2019t remotely on the same page when it comes to their longterm savings, you are not acting as a unit, and your step kid is getting the shit end of the stick. \n\nWhat you should be doing is contributing to each kid\u2019s savings amount equally, and you should be doing it together, as the parental unit of three kids, which is what you are. \n\nI know you believe he doesn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d it, but can\u2019t he just do it?", "I just think it\u2019s incredibly messed up that he\u2019s funding his ex/new family but not contributing to his current family? Where were his contributions when she was living with you guys for 6 months? Why isn\u2019t he filing for sole custody and allowing visitation? I know I\u2019m only getting a glimpse but the bio mom flip flopping every 2 months and dropping her daughter off to \u201cget her shit back together\u201d is so far from the stability the child needs and deserves. \n\nAs for you, can\u2019t force you to see the child as your own but I thought that was the point of blended families? Or at least have more of a bond? Idk I feel bad for this girl. The person who seems to be in her life, doing the most for her, doesn\u2019t see her as her kid or responsibility. You house and feed her a large chunk of the time? I don\u2019t believe you need to contribute to her college but you are responsible for her when she\u2019s staying with you and her father.. you\u2019re a blended family, you\u2019re married to her father\u2026 that is your step child? I don\u2019t think this is on you because the bio mom doesn\u2019t want you to be parenting, I think your husbands at fault. You are parenting the child seemingly more often than her bio mom.. why is he not stepping up and revisiting custody agreements?", "This comment suggests the predictable Reddit NTA may not be the right one for you. I am not sure how this account works but if you control it when they are older, you should consider including her in the benefits.", "You are taking good care of her. The way I see it, if you were to contribute more money to the account for her, you would be letting her mother off the hook financially. If her mother starts paying child support, which she should, then you could possibly save some of that for her.\n\nWith that said, if there is a small amount that you could contribute for her, that would probably be incredibly meaningful. I suspect you will be her main mother figure, as her bio mom sounds useless. NTA", "You write so beautifully I\u2019d probably upvote you even if I disagreed with you. Which I don\u2019t. Perfectly well said.", "I honestly believe that stepparents are parents when the bio ones suck or are not around. If the child has BOTH parents alive and around, a stepparent is only a dad or mom if the kid wants. Done. \nHonestly? Treating the kids equally is NOT the same as being a mom. Op is a stepmother and that's fine. If mother decides to give up her parent rights and op step up then yes I think she should do a saving account for the kid. But until then she has two adults that are capable of saving to her and I do not think it is ops job. NTA OP", "I'm kinda like you! I stock money like a squirrel so I'm all for making account as soon as possible if needed \ud83d\ude05 like he say if it's happen then you will be ready for your Kids and that all it matters", "Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f", "I don\u2019t think my aunt and uncle really saw me as a burden, either.  I know at one point they offered to adopt me. But I felt like one, because they didn\u2019t treat me the way they treated their own kids, which meant I was just some kid living in their house. My life was entirely different - different school, I went to different places for holidays, visited my dad, had different rules. Your step daughter has this too. Part of your responsibility in having gotten into a serious relationship with a guy with a kid and then having your own kids with him is to make them all feel are equal as possible. \n\nIf you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll notice, and they\u2019ll remember it later.", "He believes he will be around to fund this for them without having to contribute. He doesn\u2019t consider the what if\u2019s or anything. Either way when we die all 3 are set up just off him alone. My benefit/gift to them is while living and his is after he dies. That\u2019s really the biggest difference in my eyes. I\u2019m okay with it this way bc they get a windfall during 2 big moments in their lives", "Potentially there\u2019s a personal finance/parenting philosophy point here. Savings don\u2019t necessarily need to be separated out into different buckets - my partner and I have savings and we intend to eventually help our daughter through university/buy a house/buy a car, but we don\u2019t necessarily have separate savings accounts or even set amounts for those things. I can understand that if money is tight, it\u2019s more important for every penny to be assigned a job to do, but if you\u2019re reasonably well-off, you can be a bit more loose with financial planning.", "I explained a little deeper on a random comment but \nHe feels like bc he has the ability and does pay for their day to day expenses and will be able to pay for their first apartment/ car he doesn\u2019t need to save bc he will be there to do all of this himself when they\u2019re of age. \n\nI never said he doesn\u2019t get it. I said that it was something I myself needed to do for my kids bc of the way I grew up. I never intended to obligate or ask other parent to contribute bc I needed to do it for myself for my kids as a way to kind of make up for my childhood. I know it sounds wild but that\u2019s how my brain processed and accepted it so I\u2019ve stuck to what I always said I\u2019d do.", "He pays for everything for all 3 kiddos as well as anything I may need if I allow him to do it. \nWhen she was living with us when he\u2019s home from work he helps with homework and the parenting aspect while I get a break and do what I want/ need to do.\nAs far as custody. Initially he didn\u2019t want to break his daughter\u2019s heart so he decided against it but once it became a pattern we have been working on getting custody permanently. \n\nWhen a 8f is here there is no difference. I don\u2019t treat her like an outcast just bc her mom has an issue. If I was sure her mom wouldn\u2019t see this post I\u2019d show the videos 8f sends me talking about how she wants to come for the weekend bc she misses and loves me. She sees and feels no different from the other 2 kiddos. I know bc she and I talk weekly and I always ask how she\u2019s feeling and if there\u2019s anything she\u2019d like me to do differently. I genuinely care about her so even with her mother\u2019s boundaries I don\u2019t let it stop me from loving on her. The money aspect isn\u2019t even on her radar as she\u2019s only 8\u2026", "I tried to create an account specifically for her but the info I needed dad couldn\u2019t remember and mom freaked out on me so I took a step back. \nSomeone else commented with a good idea about opening a secret account and giving it her at 18 so I plan to talk with her dad and set one up like that. I\u2019m not a monster and I don\u2019t want her to feel different I just had to play the part her mother told me to.

Who do you think will be in the middle of the screaming phone calls and listening to your husband bitch about why his kid never sees him? *You*.\n\nAnd how do you think your stepdaughter will feel at 18 when she realizes that neither parent in her life ever cared about looking out for her like this. Even if she doesn\u2019t take it out on you, that\u2019s an ugly feeling.\n\nI think you should tell your husband he need to get his head out of his ass and start this account, because his BS is going to cause massive problems in your family.", "If step daughter were the only child I\u2019d agree, but the financial boost is only one piece of the issue. If you do it for one, you should do it for all.\n\nAnd, not for nothing, millionaires have gone broke before.

OP is being specifically barred from treating the kids equally because of the other two adult who refuse that responsibility you mention."]}
