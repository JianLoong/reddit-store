Your stepmom sounds incredibly insufferable and like she\u2019s in competition with you. Why does she keep comparing her experience to yours, trying to one up you? Your birth is completely about you and your baby\u2019s comfort and safety, especially your emotional safety. You need to have as peaceful of an environment as possible after something that life changing, so please don\u2019t feel bad for putting the safety of you and your miracle baby first. I\u2019m so sorry you can\u2019t trust your father to stand up for you. I really hope you have someone in your corner to make sure all of your birth wishes are respected.\n\nWishing you a safe and healthy delivery! \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nYour baby, your home, your rules. Childbirth is incredibly traumatic - whether vaginal or c-section. Your emotions and body are all over the place.\n\nYour well being and that of your baby are all that matters. \n\nWhen my first was born, all sorts of family members (from my husband\u2019s side) showed up uninvited to the hospital and came into my room to see the baby. I was not happy. So when my second was on its way, I specifically told my husband that we were not telling any of our family that the baby was being born. We only told my mom and dad who came to watch my first kid and they are not the excitable type anyway (when we told them we were pregnant again they just said okay and went about their business LOL). Baby was born, three days later we told folx the new kid had arrived and let them know I wasn\u2019t having any guest until I was ready. Made sure my husband was on board with that and it was fine. \n\nMy point being - you get to be picky about who sees your baby, when and where.\n\nIf you want your dad to see the baby let him know. And let him know you\u2019re not comfortable with step-mom seeing baby. If she wants to get mad, that\u2019s her problem not yours.", "NTA-You aren\u2019t overreacting. You know what her behavior is like. You need to do what is best for you and your child.", "NTA\n\nThat doesn't mean it will be easy to deal do...but you have every right to have only the people around you you want around you.\n\nSet your boundaries, but remember to make them about actions YOU can take, not things others can/can't do. If your stepmom decides she wants- to hold your baby, what action will you take? I'd suggestion something like saying, \"Oh, thank you so much for picking up XXXX, I'll take her/him now.\"\n\nSet a boundary like, \"I'm only up to seeing one person at a time right now, stepmom can come at a later time.\" If she tries to come in, you hold your boundary by saying, \"I appreciate you coming, but I said only one at a time. I appreciate you staying outside.\" Shut that door.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. She sounds painful.", "NTA. Her comments are very cruel and self-centered. You are not obligated to invite her over when you\u2019re recovering from a difficult pregnancy.", "I personally wouldn\u2019t want anyone with the kind of energy around me or my new baby. You as a parent have the right to say no I don\u2019t want her here or whatever the case is. I don\u2019t think yta. In fact she\u2019s kind of the AH in this if you ask me. It\u2019s not about comparing yourself to anyone, it\u2019s about being there to help you through your pregnancy.", "NTA. You have to do what's best for you and the baby. (Which, congratulations, btw.) Life with a newborn is stressful and difficult enough without her there making things worse.", "NTA\n\nEven if she were the most wonderful step mom on the planet if you felt too tired after giving birth and want some.quiet time take it.\n\nAs is tho...she sounds like a lot to deal with on a normal day.....", "NTA\n\nThe time for setting boundaries with your step mom was before you got pregnant, but now is the next best time.\n\nRemember, setting a boundary requires informing them of the consequence for breaking the boundary and actually enforcing the consequence.", "NTA, but you know she'll pitch a fit and not let your dad come without her... and he'll do what she wants because he always takes her side. \n\nSo, wait a while. Don't subject yourself to her presence. \n\nYou could even tell her, \"sorry, I'm not ready for a visit with you yet, you just stressed me out with your negative comments about my pregnancy, I frankly need a break from you.\" It's the truth, but it'll open a whole can of worms. Maybe you could negotiate better behavior... or maybe not.", "Nta. Set a boundary as no visitors for the first 3 weeks. You will be feeling better and recovery. You will have more strength mentally and physically. Your partner needs to be on board with you 100%.", "NTA this is your child and your birthing. This is the time to think about you and your baby and to hell with people\u2019s feelings. She obviously doesn\u2019t care about yours. You are not overreacting. You need to protect yourself and your new baby from that kind of toxicity during one of the most delicate and special moments in your life. She will only try to make it about herself and steal the spotlight all while diminishing your difficult journey through your fertility issues. She overstepped big time.", "NTA Don't let anyone kiss your baby. Baby doesn't have an immune system built up for months.\n\nSome parents don't allow visitors for months in order to protect their newborns from illness. \n\nI would want at least a few weeks to acclimate to becoming a mother and get used to taking care of my baby before I had a critical, miserable woman talking down to me. \n\nYour mental health is extremely important, especially now. Don't allow anyone to disturb your peace. Your little family comes first. Not this nasty woman.", "You are NTA. She is overstepping and you can invite whoever you want to be there. Yes, it might cause a little friction. But, she can handle it. After all, she is much better at handling everything since she had it way worse when she carried twins! She is toxic, and you should enjoy your happy moments without her, whenever you can.", "NTA. Your comfort is more important than hers when it comes to postpartum. Just tell her that the things she said while you were pregnant gave you a lot of anxiety and unnecessary worry. She may not have meant it like that, but that was the result. You don't have to be rude ( unless you want to ) and if it makes you feel better you can talk to your dad privately and ask him to give you a few weeks before anybody else comes over to give you a chance to bond and feel comfortable with being a new mother. Women have been taught practically from birth to always be polite, but when it impacts our mental or physical health enough is enough. Stand up for yourself, and if she can't take it sorry about her luck.", "NTA give yourself permission to have the lease stress possible.

Limiting visitors to those who are is also a reasonable limit.  \n\nIf they're local, and you're feeling up to it, taking the wee one to their home give you the absolute ability to leave when you're (irritated, frustrated, just DONE) by saying that you need to get home so the baby can have a nap or ANY OTHER REASON.\n\nYou may eventually just need to to look straight at her and say \"That came out really hurtfully.

You need to have a private conversation with your Dad and explain the circumstances and ask him to come alone the first time. If you have a partner, or other close friends and family around, have them run interference in case she shows up.

If he protests, tell him his relationship with her is not your relationship with her, and that he has the choice to visit alone or not at all. And then stick to that boundary.
