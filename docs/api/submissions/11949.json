My relationship with my in laws has always been rocky, however we are cordial enough. We have 2 children aged 3 years and 5 months. We live abroad and will be visiting our hometown for the first time since 2019. This is a trip we've planned for many months and look forward to. Our parents have yet to meet their grandkids (due to the pandemic). Our plans were initially to spend equal time with both sets of parents - i.e. stay with my parents for 2 weeks and then at my in laws for 2 weeks. But at the last minute, my husbands sister and her partner decided to also come home from out of town. Her dates overlap with ours and it means she will be staying with my in laws at the same time as us. My inlaws only have 1 spare bedroom so the set up would be pretty uncomfortable for my family of 4 plus another 4 adults in a 2 bedroom townhouse. As our plans were made first, and we have small kids, Id hope my in laws would have had the sense to maybe ask their daughter to book into a airbnb to make the living set up more manageable for me and my babies, but they havent. I therefore feel we should just step back and book elsewhere or just stay with my parents (who have a large 5 bedroom home, and we'd essentially have our own living quarters). We would still visit my in laws often and spend time together, just not stay over.\n\nMy in laws feel that I am: \n-being difficult\n- taking their grandkids away from them\n- that we should just \"rough it out\" so the whole family can be together\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to stay with them during this visit?\n\nEDIT to add: \n\n-I did consider Swapping the 2 weeks. But in my parents two weeks we already have commitments with my side of the family - a get together with my aunts & my grandmas birthday party - my parents are hosting the get together at their place and it will just be too much admin to rearrange with everyone at the last minute.\n\n-SIL and BIL decided at the last minute to coincide their trip with our 2 weeks that we were supposed to be with the inlaws. I am unsure how long they will stay.\n\n- they did offer my family the spare room, meaning SIL and BIL would sleep in the living area/lounge/common areas", "created_utc": 1678455070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11npabb/aita_for_refusing_to_stay_at_my_in_laws_place/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We get together with my husband's family every year since everyone lives in other places now, and his parents had a house that was the perfect size for their family growing up and now that there are spouses and grandkids... it's a tight squeeze... but part of what everyone likes is being there together, having breakfast together, and just hanging out all day. \n\nIf they are proposing that the SIL and husband get the spare room, leaving you in a miserable situation with two kids, then I would stay at your parents, but during their two weeks, you should try to make every effort to make sure the time is spent with them, not make it two bonus weeks with your family.", "NAH, I definitely understand why you wouldn't want to stay in an over-crowded townhouse, but I also understand why your in-laws would be excited to have so much of their family together at the same time.

Sure, this can work for some people, for limited amounts of time.  My mom had 10 siblings, and my maternal grandparents had a very small 2 bed house.
