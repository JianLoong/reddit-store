They got divorced after an affair was discovered, and my grandmother got one of his homes in a very, very nice area. Grandma got remarried again to another wealthy man to the person I call grandpa.\n\nGrandma and grandpa have since passed and grandma left the house to my mom who was her only child. Cash was divided between my mom and her step siblings/my aunts and uncles. The house is a huge, beautiful 5 bedroom, 5.5 bath, Georgian style home with a pool and jacuzzi.\nMy grandmother treasured that house and put a lot of effort and love into it over the decades she lived there. I could never sell it, she always said she wanted it to remain in the family for generations. Mom and dad lived there once grandma and grandpa passed and I was out of the house.

His wife, whom I don\u2019t get along all that well with, said that since I have the extra space they wouldn\u2019t mind them and their two kids moving in for a while. According to them, they\u2019re tired of \u201cslumming it\u201d in the city in an apartment and was hoping they could get a higher quality of life in a nice neighborhood. They could save the money from rent and put it towards their own house in a year or two.\n\nI was put on the spot, but I told them no. That I valued my privacy and solitude. I told them that my lifestyle conflicts with theirs and it wouldn\u2019t work. They called me selfish for not even considering it, and that I should at least take some time. I told them the answer would be the same if I did think about it. My dad\u2019s side of the family said I\u2019m being selfish. My dad has assured me he\u2019s taking care of it and he\u2019s on my side.

Just \"I'm sorry, it won't be possible\" \"I'm sorry, I can give you the name of a realtor\" repeated and varied.", "NTA. Years ago, my family came to town to visit my parents and me, and my uncle wanted my cousin and her husband to stay at my place, so they didn't have to pay for an additional hotel room. At the time, I only had a twin bed in my guestroom, and the queen was in my room. My uncle started to suggest that we could switch rooms for a few nights. I said absolutely not. It's my house, and I should not have to move out of my room to accommodate them. My parents agreed with me. They stayed in a hotel. \n\nAlso - it is never one year. If those kids get comfortable in the school district and they \"can't find a place they like,\" they will continue to stay with you. Keep your stance and say no. It's not your fault they don't have funds to live above their needs.", "People feel so entitled to other peoples stuff. It blows my mind. NTA.", "Completely agree and also wonder how easily they would ever leave\u2026.I can see them settling in and finding it easier to suggest single op could find somewhere more suitable for themselves. Def don\u2019t give in OP!", "The owner of the house (mom) said no. End of story.", "I had a very similar situation. My wife and I lived rent free in a wealthy relative\u2019s house while they were traveling. We honestly were reluctant to do it and it was a lot of work. We also paid all of the utilities, landscaping, maid services, etc. we replaced appliances that broke. It was a net financial benefit to us, but not as big as some might think. \n\nSome relatives were very presumptuous about declaring they would come stay with us. At one point, the owner of the house even invited an annoying relative to come live with us. My wife and I said that was fine, but we would just move out, if that person moved in. Then the owner backpedaled and disinvited that person because they knew they had a good deal with us living there.", "They would definitely mooch off of him, tell me if I'm wrong but it kind of sounds like they wouldn't pay anything since they want to save money. \n\nAnd the wife would probably be running the house and impose on him her rules.\n\nNTA", "When people receive something for free - like a rent free place to stay.  Guess what happens - they have no vested interest in making sure its maintained and cared for and since its nothing to them but a free place to sleep - THEY TEAR IT UP.", "I don\u2019t understand how people see someone in their family that owns a home and think: I will go live with them because they have room. My cousin recently bought a house with his girlfriend, it\u2019s 5 bedrooms and they don\u2019t have children. Never in a million years would I suggest such a crazy thing. His little sister wouldn\u2019t even suggest it, and she\u2019s looking to move out of their parents house. I don\u2019t understand people. NTA.", "I watched this show on Netflix involving nightmare roommates. Once you have mail that starts being delivered to the house, you actually have to evict the person even if they're not paying rent. People have come in and taken over people's apartments, moved furniture around, went through their private belongings took whatever they wanted, had the person that was living there forced to leave because of a restraining order by the unwanted roommate. Once I saw that I vowed I would NEVER ever have a roommate.", "Yup", "Considering no one invited them, they pretty much tried to invite themselves, sounds like they don't plan on paying any rent so they can save to buy their own house and feel they deserve to live in a better neighborhood because they're sick of slumming in the city makes it sound like OP is dodging a bullet. The cousins have no claim to the property, OP's mother owns it and said no and just from this initial attitude getting rid of them once they move in will take an act of Congress. Who just invites themselves to move in?", "In the states they get squatters rights. They\u2019d be a pain in the ass to remove.", "Read about shit that happens when people win major lottery prizes. Previously-unseen relatives flat out demanding large sums of money and threatening violence if they don't get their way is rule rather than exception.", "I don\u2019t even like staying at my IL\u2019s house for holidays even though they a) invite us, and b) it\u2019s only for a night.  Hell, I don\u2019t even really like having to stay at other people\u2019s houses when we have an emergency.\n\nI don\u2019t understand just inviting yourself anywhere ever.", "Yes. \nIt's important to know your rights. \nMaybe more important to know their rights.", "Hahahaha.  Absolutely not, then.  What bold parasites they are!", "They asked for too much. Yes, your cousin feels like its his house as well but he has to be realistic too. They can't stay in the house for so long, expecting to contribute nothing and to take advantage of you and your family so that they can get a house of theirs. Because of what they explained, you wouldn't not get a penny for maintaining the house while they stayed there. \n\nAnd a year or two, its too long to help themselves at someone's house. I don't know if you would let them stay a night or two but that's it. They went beyond their boundaries. This is house is now your mom, not grandma. They need to realise its not like when grandma was here.", "Yes. But my point I'm making is based on their statements they well know they could help (and seems like OP also feels like they also should help). I don't just go with nta because people want justification for their actions. OP leaves that part out, and I would be NTA", "I gave my opinion and stick by it. It's not the \"no\" I'm calling out. It's the \"I know I could but I'm not gunna\" part of the post that lead to my YTA", "Then leave out the part acknowledging the space and ability to do so. That's the reason I called OP the AH", " I didn\u2019t even have to say anything.", "Bingo.", "Why its true that op has the space to help them"]}
