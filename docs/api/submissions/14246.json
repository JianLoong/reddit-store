I need some help, I think I did the right thing, but I feel like an AH, so I need a judgement.\n\nBackground: My maternal grandmother got remarried to a wealthy man after my bio-grandad died when my mom was young. They got divorced after an affair was discovered, and my grandmother got one of his homes in a very, very nice area. Grandma got remarried again to another wealthy man to the person I call grandpa.\n\nGrandma and grandpa have since passed and grandma left the house to my mom who was her only child. Cash was divided between my mom and her step siblings/my aunts and uncles. The house is a huge, beautiful 5 bedroom, 5.5 bath, Georgian style home with a pool and jacuzzi.\nMy grandmother treasured that house and put a lot of effort and love into it over the decades she lived there. I could never sell it, she always said she wanted it to remain in the family for generations. Mom and dad lived there once grandma and grandpa passed and I was out of the house. However they\u2019ve since moved to Florida and left the house in my care. This house is a pain in the butt to maintain though. Neither me or my parents are rich by any stretch of the imagination. Every penny of my mom\u2019s inheritance goes to maintaining the house.\n\nNow the issue. My favorite cousin on my grand dad\u2019s side asked me recently about moving in. His wife, whom I don\u2019t get along all that well with, said that since I have the extra space they wouldn\u2019t mind them and their two kids moving in for a while. According to them, they\u2019re tired of \u201cslumming it\u201d in the city in an apartment and was hoping they could get a higher quality of life in a nice neighborhood. They could save the money from rent and put it towards their own house in a year or two.\n\nI was put on the spot, but I told them no. That I valued my privacy and solitude. I told them that my lifestyle conflicts with theirs and it wouldn\u2019t work. They called me selfish for not even considering it, and that I should at least take some time. I told them the answer would be the same if I did think about it. My dad\u2019s side of the family said I\u2019m being selfish. My dad has assured me he\u2019s taking care of it and he\u2019s on my side. Mom has told me under no circumstances am I allowed to let anyone move in under penalty of death lol.\n\nReddit, I have to wonder am I being selfish here?
