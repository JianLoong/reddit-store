They got divorced after an affair was discovered, and my grandmother got one of his homes in a very, very nice area. Grandma got remarried again to another wealthy man to the person I call grandpa.\n\nGrandma and grandpa have since passed and grandma left the house to my mom who was her only child. Cash was divided between my mom and her step siblings/my aunts and uncles. The house is a huge, beautiful 5 bedroom, 5.5 bath, Georgian style home with a pool and jacuzzi.\nMy grandmother treasured that house and put a lot of effort and love into it over the decades she lived there. I could never sell it, she always said she wanted it to remain in the family for generations. Mom and dad lived there once grandma and grandpa passed and I was out of the house. However they\u2019ve since moved to Florida and left the house in my care. This house is a pain in the butt to maintain though. Neither me or my parents are rich by any stretch of the imagination.

His wife, whom I don\u2019t get along all that well with, said that since I have the extra space they wouldn\u2019t mind them and their two kids moving in for a while. According to them, they\u2019re tired of \u201cslumming it\u201d in the city in an apartment and was hoping they could get a higher quality of life in a nice neighborhood. They could save the money from rent and put it towards their own house in a year or two.\n\nI was put on the spot, but I told them no. That I valued my privacy and solitude. I told them that my lifestyle conflicts with theirs and it wouldn\u2019t work. They called me selfish for not even considering it, and that I should at least take some time. I told them the answer would be the same if I did think about it. My dad\u2019s side of the family said I\u2019m being selfish. My dad has assured me he\u2019s taking care of it and he\u2019s on my side.
