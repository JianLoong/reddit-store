Uncle made a reasonable choice, even if it isn't what you would have done.\n\nThat all said, if that reads as a punishment to you, you may want to think about how you are going to deal with situations that *do* require punishment. There are whole books written on the subject. I've worked with kids for years, and the parents who are afraid to take anything from their children, or offer any discipline, raise absolute uncontrollable hellions, and I want to make sure you have a plan for what you're going to do when it is necessary to rebuke bad behavior (not that this situation was bad behavior at all).", "I love how OP is downvoting the truth.

Your BIL\u2019s actions were a behavioural correction that anyone would make, and not returning the book to your son after he started having a fit is the right thing to do IMO, especially if he has violent and unpredictable fits as you mentioned in other comments, me might ultimately throw the book and damage it or something else.

It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for an adult who thinks a book is about to get ripped to put it aside and move on to something else. It\u2019s not a punishment and it\u2019s not discipline to remove a kid\u2019s hand and put away a fragile toy if it seems like it\u2019s about to get damaged. Redirection is fine. \n\nYour son is going to interact with more different people as he gets older. Eventually he\u2019ll go to a preschool and a school where there will be adults who haven\u2019t known him since he was born and kids who are strangers. He\u2019ll start going for playdates at other kid\u2019s houses where you aren\u2019t in charge and you may not be present the whole time. You need to start learning how to give up control and be okay with different people interacting with him in different ways; and he also needs to learn that not every single adult is exactly like Mom. The earlier you can both get used to the idea that different people do things differently, the better it will be for both of you. \n\nYou said in the comments that you have legitimate safety concerns about their house. That\u2019s a good reason to prevent sleepovers. But not just because your BIL doesn\u2019t do exactly what you do.", "Lol OP is getting demolished in this post. The uncle didn't \"discipline\" the child, he just took the book away from him so he wouldnt destroy it (Whether he was actually destroying it or not). The uncle wasn't familiar with that book maybe, all you needed to say was \"Oh no its okay! He won't hurt it\". The uncle wasn't rude at all, who wouldn't try to prevent a kid from destroying something? \n\nYou're NTA for not letting your son spend the night, you have total control and authority over where he sleeps (You didn't mention a father in the picture, so i'm ignoring his input for now), but this isn't good parenting. You can't expect people to be mind readers when it comes to your son or anything else.", "Light YTA. You need to talk to your BIL about this. I opened this thinking he spanked or left alone in time out. He removed a book and told your child he can\u2019t have it if he is going to rip it. That is not a punishment, it is a consequence. I have done the same with my kids when they were younger. And let me tell you just because he didn\u2019t rip it the last time you read it doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t this time.\n\nYou explain to your BIL your son\u2019s speech and cognitive delays and what expectations there might be or might need to be changed during interactions with your son. Communication between the adults is imperative, especially with a child with delays.", "I\u2019m trying to! I have a lot of anxiety regarding my children. I just started medication because it got so much worse after my youngest ended up in the hospital for 10 days at only a month old", "I feel like OP is the kind of person who would be all butthurt and threaten legal action if another kid at the playground accidentally kicked up some sand at her kid. Then turn around and be apoplectic if her kid hit another child and the other one pushed him away in self-defense. I can hear it now. \"He only hit him, he wasn't going to kill him. He doesn't know his own strength, the other kid startled him and really needs to learn boundaries. Come on BraidenLynley let's go get ice cream.\"  \n\nI hope her kid enjoys not having any friends because \"momma bear\" here pitches  a pissfit over nothing.", "I\u2019m a very quiet person and usually warm up quick but they give me this vibe and I haven\u2019t warmed up after 3 years.

After that if he does it again I\u2019ll take them away saying we\u2019re done coloring for now. If he\u2019s upset and throwing his cup I\u2019ll take his cup and put it on the counter saying once you\u2019re calm and not throwing it you can have it ( it\u2019s a metal tumbler so it would hurt if he struck someone with it) I do the same with food. Sometimes he likes to break the chips for some reason", "Hmm okay whatever you say \ud83d\ude02", "So am I supposed to write out a list or something because I\u2019ve told them things regards to my son in the past and his dad keeps his sister (the aunt) updated on him as well.

They know he\u2019s very independent I\u2019ve told them multiple times about how he is", "I probably did overreact but he\u2019s my first baby. He\u2019s the best little guy ever and a piece of my heart walking around so I\u2019m very protective", "When we\u2019re over there I don\u2019t let him outside. Last time we were over there he went outside a couple times to look at their cow and he immediately went straight for the pool that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t a concern because I hadn\u2019t let him outside over there but now he knows how to open the crank door handles and can escape easily", "Response from OP after being asked if the kid has a history of being destructive:\n\n>Destructive to his self. Not necessarily objects. He\u2019ll throw his cup every now and then but he will bang his head on anything, gag himself, hit himself. He\u2019s busted his nose a couple times.\n\nDoes she even read what she writes. So, if your kid start banging his head on a third party QLED TV or work laptop, that's not destructive on objects. So, expect other people to be aware of it and afraid of him damaging their properties, learn to live and accept that, and stop making villains of people that are just trying to cope in their best possible way with your kids behavior.", "Uncle could have also given him a chance to open the flap. He just saw that he was holding the flap wrong. Wasn\u2019t going to rip it. His hand placement was wrong is all.

People aren't mind-readers to know how you expect or handle things. You are supposed to be his biggest advocate.

My 18-year-old is completely neurotypical and I wouldn't have let them spend the night out at 2 years old! \n\nOP, you're getting downvoted on this answer because unfortunately you no longer have the luxury of being \"very quiet\" or of waiting another 3+ years to get a \"good vibe\" from your BIL. You have a child now; it's your responsibility to stand up for him even when it makes you uncomfortable. You 100% should have stepped in and told your BIL what your son was trying to communicate and that the book was safe in his hands. Instead, you left a 2-year-old - nonverbal or not - to navigate that situation alone, which he was understandably unable to do. He likely won't remember this interaction but if you don't start standing up for him and yourself, he's going to quickly learn that he can't trust you to watch out for him. Frankly, it sounds like your BIL was trying to correct him in a friendly way (which I'm basing solely on his use of the word \"buddy,\" so take that with a grain of salt) but at the end of the day, it was *your* job to stand up for your son, explain to your BIL what he was trying to do, and let your BIL know that you don't take books away as a punishment since he doesn't rip them, as a habit. If the book belonged to BIL, then all you could do was to explain it all to him and then it's up to him if he wants to give the book back to your son. You're NTA for not wanting him to spend a night away from home at this age, but YTA for not standing up for him - and yourself/your parenting - and allowing your BIL to discipline him at all, when you're there watching the whole thing! Please don't make a habit of letting him down just because you don't like confrontation. I hate it, too, but our kids need us to step up sometimes.

If you want your child to be in a healthy and understanding environment you should a) be vocal about his needs, features, behavioral issues and b) you may write down some of them that are the most important.\n\nYour BIL did nothing wrong. BTW, whom does this book belong to?", ">My mom can remember everything\n\n>except for medication and dosages.\n\nWell fuck, that's kinda important.", "That's because you allow her to spend time with her grandson. \nIf his aunt and uncle don't spend as much time with their nephew, of course they're not going to remember everything that his grandma does. \ud83d\ude44", "The ungated pool and non-baby-proofed house is what you should be concerned with, not your BIL who gently removed a book from your kid because thought it might get ripped. Like others have said, your priorities are way out of order here.", "Got it. Thanks for the clarification!", "You need to understand that other people are going to correct your child when he's not acting correctly\n That's not a bad thing. Gently correcting a child provides consistency, which your son needs. Uncle was helping and you're pouting about it. \n\nA gentle correction is not punishment. It's just helping a child learn right vs wrong.", "Please, while we understand being a little over protective over kids with development problems like yours, stop being delusional and dumb.\n\n>Destructive to his self. Not necessarily objects.\n\nfollowed by:\n\n>He\u2019ll throw his cup every now and then, but he will bang his head on anything...\n\nDo you even read what you write. So, if your kid start banging his head on a third party QLED TV or work laptop, that's not destructive on objects. So, expect other people to be aware of it and afraid of him damaging their properties, learn to live and accept that, and stop making villains of people that are just trying to cope in their best possible way with your kids shortcomings.", "You keep throwing this it like an excuse or something. If a kid is getting screened for autism then obviously there is a chance they have it, it does not excuse your lack of accountability toward your child's behaviors. My toddler who was not autistic never ripped a book, until one day he did. Your BIL handled the situation like an ordinary adult. You are handling the situation like a child. Honestly it sounds like you have an issue with your BIL and are trying to use your child as a pawn in some sort of messed up game with the BIL. Time to grow up and be adult. Start with talking to both your sister and you BIL. You do not have to let your kid go over there, but be honest about it instead of making up an excuse. Just say you do not like your BIL and that is why you do not want your kid there. I am willing to bet they already know.", "Are you getting him further testing?  He's not at risk for it, he either has it or not.", "I'm Australian so whenever I see someone online casually mention an unfenced pool I lose my shit a little. \n\n(we have some very strict laws about appropriate pool fencing, and we take that shit very, very seriously)", "Yeah, that\u2019s definitely true about not wanting your 2 year old to spend a night somewhere. And heck, removing a book from a kid because you think they\u2019re gonna rip it doesn\u2019t constitute as a punishment, IMO. Since OP thinks it does though, she needs to use her words and let her BIL now.", "OP's reasoning seems to be all over the place. Fixation on tiny details, ignores much more serious stuff. Sounds like the anxiety meds aren't enough by themselves - she is struggling to evaluate risks properly.", "Same in Quebec. Leading province in drowning deaths so now everyone has to have a fence.", "Most places in the US do too\u2026 it\u2019s illegal in GA to have a pool without a fence or something surrounding it.", "Americans do too, since if someone dies in your pool you can go to jail/if someone breaks into your house and hurts themselves, you guessed it - you can go to jail. But, I think we can all agree this isn\u2019t the average OP that makes sense so\u2026", "Where we live, if you have an inground pool, you need to have a fence (whether its around the pool itself or your entire yard, but you need it, they won't approve your pool otherwise). And if you have an above ground pool it needs to be a certain height and the ladder must be removed when not in use. Its crazy that anyone with a pool wouldn't have a fence, not just for themselves, and their kids, but its a liability. If some kid happens to get out and wander onto your property and into your pool that doesn't have a fence, you can be held liable.", "The rules in the US vary a ton from town to town, and they are usually a municipal ordinance, not a state ordinance. In lots of places, all you have to do is have a 6-foot privacy fence around the yard if you have a pool. The pool itself doesn't need to be fenced in, but the yard does.", "Absolutely wild that you've written this comment as though people only take the law seriously so they don't go to jail, rather than because they don't want people to die.", "It seems you are correct! \ud83e\udd2d where I live in GA, it is illegal.", "Honestly some of the laws we have in areas of the US so that \"people won't die\" really are only followed so one doesn't go to jail. In some cases, it's because the outcome is super unlikely or the law doesn't make sense, in many cases it's people don't care what happens to others just themselves. It's sad no matter which side it falls on really."]}
