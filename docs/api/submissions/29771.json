Uncle made a reasonable choice, even if it isn't what you would have done.\n\nThat all said, if that reads as a punishment to you, you may want to think about how you are going to deal with situations that *do* require punishment. There are whole books written on the subject. I've worked with kids for years, and the parents who are afraid to take anything from their children, or offer any discipline, raise absolute uncontrollable hellions, and I want to make sure you have a plan for what you're going to do when it is necessary to rebuke bad behavior (not that this situation was bad behavior at all).", "I love how OP is downvoting the truth.

Your BIL\u2019s actions were a behavioural correction that anyone would make, and not returning the book to your son after he started having a fit is the right thing to do IMO, especially if he has violent and unpredictable fits as you mentioned in other comments, me might ultimately throw the book and damage it or something else.

It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for an adult who thinks a book is about to get ripped to put it aside and move on to something else. It\u2019s not a punishment and it\u2019s not discipline to remove a kid\u2019s hand and put away a fragile toy if it seems like it\u2019s about to get damaged. Redirection is fine. \n\nYour son is going to interact with more different people as he gets older. Eventually he\u2019ll go to a preschool and a school where there will be adults who haven\u2019t known him since he was born and kids who are strangers. He\u2019ll start going for playdates at other kid\u2019s houses where you aren\u2019t in charge and you may not be present the whole time. You need to start learning how to give up control and be okay with different people interacting with him in different ways; and he also needs to learn that not every single adult is exactly like Mom. The earlier you can both get used to the idea that different people do things differently, the better it will be for both of you. \n\nYou said in the comments that you have legitimate safety concerns about their house. That\u2019s a good reason to prevent sleepovers. But not just because your BIL doesn\u2019t do exactly what you do.", "Lol OP is getting demolished in this post. The uncle didn't \"discipline\" the child, he just took the book away from him so he wouldnt destroy it (Whether he was actually destroying it or not). The uncle wasn't familiar with that book maybe, all you needed to say was \"Oh no its okay! He won't hurt it\". The uncle wasn't rude at all, who wouldn't try to prevent a kid from destroying something? \n\nYou're NTA for not letting your son spend the night, you have total control and authority over where he sleeps (You didn't mention a father in the picture, so i'm ignoring his input for now), but this isn't good parenting. You can't expect people to be mind readers when it comes to your son or anything else.", "Light YTA. You need to talk to your BIL about this. I opened this thinking he spanked or left alone in time out. He removed a book and told your child he can\u2019t have it if he is going to rip it. That is not a punishment, it is a consequence. I have done the same with my kids when they were younger. And let me tell you just because he didn\u2019t rip it the last time you read it doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t this time.\n\nYou explain to your BIL your son\u2019s speech and cognitive delays and what expectations there might be or might need to be changed during interactions with your son. Communication between the adults is imperative, especially with a child with delays.", "I\u2019m trying to! I have a lot of anxiety regarding my children. I just started medication because it got so much worse after my youngest ended up in the hospital for 10 days at only a month old", "I feel like OP is the kind of person who would be all butthurt and threaten legal action if another kid at the playground accidentally kicked up some sand at her kid. Then turn around and be apoplectic if her kid hit another child and the other one pushed him away in self-defense. I can hear it now. \"He only hit him, he wasn't going to kill him. He doesn't know his own strength, the other kid startled him and really needs to learn boundaries. Come on BraidenLynley let's go get ice cream.\"  \n\nI hope her kid enjoys not having any friends because \"momma bear\" here pitches  a pissfit over nothing.", "I\u2019m a very quiet person and usually warm up quick but they give me this vibe and I haven\u2019t warmed up after 3 years.

After that if he does it again I\u2019ll take them away saying we\u2019re done coloring for now. If he\u2019s upset and throwing his cup I\u2019ll take his cup and put it on the counter saying once you\u2019re calm and not throwing it you can have it ( it\u2019s a metal tumbler so it would hurt if he struck someone with it) I do the same with food. Sometimes he likes to break the chips for some reason", "Hmm okay whatever you say \ud83d\ude02", "So am I supposed to write out a list or something because I\u2019ve told them things regards to my son in the past and his dad keeps his sister (the aunt) updated on him as well.

They know he\u2019s very independent I\u2019ve told them multiple times about how he is", "I probably did overreact but he\u2019s my first baby. He\u2019s the best little guy ever and a piece of my heart walking around so I\u2019m very protective", "When we\u2019re over there I don\u2019t let him outside. Last time we were over there he went outside a couple times to look at their cow and he immediately went straight for the pool that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t a concern because I hadn\u2019t let him outside over there but now he knows how to open the crank door handles and can escape easily", "Response from OP after being asked if the kid has a history of being destructive:\n\n>Destructive to his self. Not necessarily objects. He\u2019ll throw his cup every now and then but he will bang his head on anything, gag himself, hit himself. He\u2019s busted his nose a couple times.\n\nDoes she even read what she writes. So, if your kid start banging his head on a third party QLED TV or work laptop, that's not destructive on objects. So, expect other people to be aware of it and afraid of him damaging their properties, learn to live and accept that, and stop making villains of people that are just trying to cope in their best possible way with your kids behavior.", "Uncle could have also given him a chance to open the flap. He just saw that he was holding the flap wrong. Wasn\u2019t going to rip it. His hand placement was wrong is all.

People aren't mind-readers to know how you expect or handle things. You are supposed to be his biggest advocate.

My 18-year-old is completely neurotypical and I wouldn't have let them spend the night out at 2 years old! \n\nOP, you're getting downvoted on this answer because unfortunately you no longer have the luxury of being \"very quiet\" or of waiting another 3+ years to get a \"good vibe\" from your BIL. You have a child now; it's your responsibility to stand up for him even when it makes you uncomfortable. You 100% should have stepped in and told your BIL what your son was trying to communicate and that the book was safe in his hands. Instead, you left a 2-year-old - nonverbal or not - to navigate that situation alone, which he was understandably unable to do. He likely won't remember this interaction but if you don't start standing up for him and yourself, he's going to quickly learn that he can't trust you to watch out for him. Frankly, it sounds like your BIL was trying to correct him in a friendly way (which I'm basing solely on his use of the word \"buddy,\" so take that with a grain of salt) but at the end of the day, it was *your* job to stand up for your son, explain to your BIL what he was trying to do, and let your BIL know that you don't take books away as a punishment since he doesn't rip them, as a habit. If the book belonged to BIL, then all you could do was to explain it all to him and then it's up to him if he wants to give the book back to your son. You're NTA for not wanting him to spend a night away from home at this age, but YTA for not standing up for him - and yourself/your parenting - and allowing your BIL to discipline him at all, when you're there watching the whole thing! Please don't make a habit of letting him down just because you don't like confrontation. I hate it, too, but our kids need us to step up sometimes.

That to me is not really a big reason to refuse access to the child. It's different than you parent sure, but it's not abusive or harmful. \n\nI'm going with YTA. This seems like a really ridiculous response to a rather mundane thing really. Do I like the way my MIL and some other family members interact with my child? No. If they overstep boundaries that I think are actually harmful like abuse or being verbally aggressive, etc, then I would step in but otherwise...something like this I would not see the need to do. \n\nI think you should keep your son from sleepovers though until he's more caught up in his communication though, and perhaps speak with your family about the delays and issues he's having so they can be made more aware of them.", "This just seems more like a misunderstanding than anything else. If your BIL doesn't have kids, for instance, he may have just had the quick instinct to keep him from ripping the flap because he thought that's what was coming instead of giving him a few seconds to see how it played out like a seasoned parent may do.

As long as they're safe, and I agree the pool thing is a much bigger deal than the book, then your kid will just learn to act differently around them, not become a serial killer because your BIL didn't act exactly as you would have.  It will be much better for your mental health and possibly for your kid (I'm only a parent not an expert in childhood development or neurodiverhent children) if you realize that sooner than later.

Avoiding the consequence has to be an achievable goal.)", "Like if she genuinely has some things that are okay for him to damage, like books, because they are *his* - which is not an invalid way to deal with things sometimes - then all she had to do was explain to the uncle that it\u2019s the kid\u2019s book so it\u2019s okay if he tears the flap a bit. (Or if the book was just for the kid to use, then the uncle\u2019s approach was fine and she needs to explain to the kid again that he can\u2019t treat all people\u2019s stuff like it belongs to him.)\n\nMy bonus kid is kind of stubborn and independent and when he was little I could totally see him being stubborn about wanting to manipulate the pages himself even if it did some damage. My solution absolutely would have been \u201cyou can handle your books how you want but if you damage it too much then you won\u2019t be able to read it anymore\u201d and then let him learn that for himself.

Why do you think that is too much effort?", "A child seemed to be on the verge of destroying the book- he\u2019d be sad if he did. Uncle **redirected**. It\u2019s okay, helpful, and developmentally appropriate to be hands-on with toddler guidance. He did not get rough. He was not \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d. Your son will learn that not everyone knows the details like \u201che never damaged this book before with the same behavior\u201d.", "The fact that your kid had a fit from a miscommunication is an indication of a potential parenting problem. He was frustrated. He can start learning to deal with frustration. (Yes, I know it is very hard sometimes, I have ADHD and frustration is and has always been my nemesis.) You are not helping him if you address the fact he can\u2019t deal with frustration by just preventing him from being exposed to frustration. This sounds like it was actually an excellent situation in which to help him do a little work on frustration management, by you talking to the uncle to explain he needs to give the kid more time and if he rips it a little bit by accident  it\u2019s not a big deal, and by getting the kid calmed down then putting him back in the situation with the uncle with your supervision. (So the kid learned that a bit of frustration is not the end of the world and he doesn\u2019t need to get so upset next time.)\n\nReally you need to start thinking of parenting (even now) as \u201chow can I help him learn to be a functional adult?\u201d - I\u2019m sure it seems weird to think of a tiny kid as an adult, but reality is that early childhood is when we learn a *lot* of skills about regulating emotions and dealing with problem solving and so on, and those things are much much harder to develop when you get older. So he has to have exposure to things that aren\u2019t all fun and rainbows. The key is for him to have exposure to those things at an age/development appropriate level (so not too overwhelming) and in safe environments. With an uncle who doesn\u2019t sound abusive or harmful is a safe environment - at most the uncle needs some information on what you\u2019ve taught the kid is okay. (Note: he may not agree with you that some stuff is okay. That is fine too as long as it is clear to the kid when different standards apply and he is able to appreciate that different places and different people have slightly different rules. If your kid isn\u2019t quite there yet then uncle needs to just not do the things where there is disagreement with the kid. In this case, for example, if they\u2019d been reading a book that belonged to uncle\u2019s house that uncle provided, uncle is allowed to say it has to be handled more gently.  If kid can\u2019t understand that uncle\u2019s book is not the same as his book, then kid just only reads his books at uncle\u2019s house and uncle\u2019s books are put away until kid can understand the difference. If that makes sense. He needs to be challenged but set up for success so the challenge is something he is able to manage.)", "But\u2026there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s normal redirection. Your toddler is not \u201cindependent\u201d - he\u2019s two. He may get angry when people help him do things but that might be something you have to work on with him.

But continuing to frame this as a \"punishment\" or \"something that's been done to your kid\" is unproductive and possibly disingenuous.

I asked her the same thing.", "And then the crazy mom enters and yells at the kind man!   So you know who the villain is!", "he did both, he first removed the hand then he took the book away, but anyway I don't know where he did wrong, I would have done the same.", "Pretty sure she said he did take the book away saying \" If you're going to rip it, you can't play with it *buddy*.\" It was a misunderstanding...not an act of discipline, at least in my books. Strange such an overprotective mother would even allow her 2yo to sleep away though.", "It is a punishment though, bcs the kid WANTS the book but can't have it because of his behaviour. Taking the book away may be to prevent damage, but it is also a \"punishment\" for bad behaviour, which is confirmed by \"you can't have it if you're gonna break it, buddy!\".\n\nAlso, having the book removed is a repercussion of him being rough on the book. If he hadn't, he'd still have the book.", "Spanking isn\u2019t a punishment, it only teaches your kid to fear or even hate you. Physical harm is not how you discipline a child and if that\u2019s your plan, please don\u2019t have children. Especially not with a child already having delays.", "Yeah I saw the part about the ungated pool. That is way more important than the uncle taking the book away from a fussy child.", "Yeah - the uncle's house has an ungated pool and an electric fence, but OP's here worrying about this book and how the man spoke to the toddler.", "ah, okay. explains it, thanks.", "I think the rest of the post was the excuse for her not to let the kid sleep away.", "I think if we replaced \"book\" with \"phone\", people would understand a lot better. I don't think the uncle was wrong to do what he did, given the information he had, but it is discipline in the form of a punishment. Punishment doesn't have to be this big awful thing, it's about learning that there are consequences to your actions.", "Yes, similar to how you teach a dog \"leave it.\" Put a high value treat in you open palm and when they try to lung to take it, close your fist. They back off, open hand. Reward when they wait/look at you instead of lunging for the treat\n\nYou're teaching discipline by crafting a scenario where impulsively lunging at whatever they want is explicitly the cause of them NOT getting the thing (yes the dog will understand this as a consequence if done correctly and consistently). And where the desired behavior nets the outcome they desire (treat)\n\nThis scenario is basically the same except ripping a book instead of lunging at food. If the kid wants the book then by understanding he only gets it when he treats it gently, that encourages the gentle behavior.\n\nI'm going NAH, uncle not an asshole for honestly misinterpreting the kid and gently correcting. Op not an asshole for feeling son should only do overnights with people who can understand his communication, for his safety/comfort. But imo this should be a flexible boundary as he gets more skills and his extended family work (with ops help) on learning to communicate more effectively\n\nFwiw, I was in the first percentile of language pronunciation as a young kid and only my mom could understand me. It was definitely really distressing to think I was communicating very clearly what I wanted or needed, but the other person kept not getting it. I still remember one very bad meltdown I had over my father not understanding \"stamp\" when I was like 4", "Why would I have children with a child already having delays?  \n\nSeriously though I mention spanking because the whole point of this post is the kid being disciplined in a way that the mom was upset about. If it was something corporal in nature, that would be way out of line and something I could see the mom getting upset about, not gently taking an item away.  \n\nNo, \"physical harm\" is not in my \"plan\" don't you worry. It doesn't really matter though since I can't have children but thanks for that.", "And Ontario, and BC, and the prairies except Alberta (no surprise)", "Jesus Christ, you know what I meant.", "As far as I know, the town in PA that I live in doesn't even require your yard to be fenced in for above ground pools. You just have to have a removable ladder for the pool. I don't know if it's different for inground pools or not because I don't know anyone that has one.", "In MI (my area at least) you just need a gate separating the exterior yard and pool. So if the yard is not fenced a gate at the top of the stairs to an above ground pool is considered adequate. It\u2019s crazy.", "But there\u2019s always a civil liability even if there\u2019s no rules! If that information was passed along more, maybe people would be more likely to fence them in!", "That\u2019s wild to you? We have someone walking in a grocery store and shooting random people every other day. Nothing is wild anymore\u2026and I\u2019m an European living here, that should tell you stuff.", "I think that's pretty common. Above ground pools aren't considered a permanent structure like an inground pool so there is generally no ordinance for them, and they're also less of a drowning risk."]}
