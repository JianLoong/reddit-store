My parents both work full-time so my MIL came to stay for the first couple of weeks to support us. I spent 4 nights in hospital, so having the help seemed a good idea. She enabled us to get more sleep, and helped us with feeds/changes whilst I figured out household stuff. After 4 days of this, I realised it wasn\u2019t the help I wanted. I wanted to be with my baby doing nappies/feeds, and have some alone time with him. I needed MIL to do the dishwasher, cooking, boring stuff. I tried to approach this diplomatically, e.g. asking her to do a change at 7AM and then put him to sleep back in our bedroom so that we\u2019d wake up when he next cried and start our day as a family. Several times my husband and I woke up at midday with no baby in the room, and she told us it\u2019s because he wouldn\u2019t \u201csettle\u201d and we needed the sleep. This got gradually got worse, with her ignoring direct instructions from us (I.e. don\u2019t feed the baby from a bottle), and so we decided to implement some boundaries. \n\nWe went out for the afternoon just the 3 of us (me, him, baby) and when we came back she was visibility upset and sulky with us. So then when we went out again we felt guilted into bringing her along. \n\nWhen she finally left, I felt she\u2019d completely pushed me to the side and taken away my opportunity to bond - which was especially devestating after our losses. We decided to give it some time before seeing her again. My husband and I agreed to cancel future \u201chelp\u201d but didn\u2019t want to ruin Christmas so waited until after to tell her. His whole family came for Christmas and due to our worries about germs we implemented a no-one holds the baby rule (except us). She spent the whole day sulking and ignoring my family, which resulted in my Granny (F84) leaving after 1hr because she thought she\u2019d offended her and didn\u2019t want to spoil the day. \n\nShe then text my husband after, saying she was heartbroken seeing the baby and not being able to hold him. He then told her future visits were cancelled as we want to parent solo and bond as a family, but offered meeting for walks halfway. She declined, saying it was too painful to see and not hold the baby, as she had spent a magical time with him and missed him so much.\n\nI feel really sad for my husband as his mum is now isolating herself from my family. I\u2019ve tried to be diplomatic and not create drama. But she\u2019s been a huge distraction from our first 7 weeks of parenthood and I am desperate to phone her up and say that she\u2019s ruined my experience of being a mum, been horrible to my family and owes them an apology, and I don\u2019t want her seeing the baby anymore.

It\u2019s also super unfair to your family and the rest of hubbys family if there\u2019s a no touch rule and your MIL is touching the baby. I think you made the right call with that. Just stick with your boundaries, don\u2019t say anything to her about it. Wish you the best of luck, congratulations on your baby!", "NTA it's your child and you're allowed to set boundaries buuut you keep saying she 'ruined your experience of being a mum' and she took away your bond with the baby which is quite dramatic and I think you're seriously doing *yourself* a disservice by having this mindset. You're so hung up on the idea that it's all been ruined for you that it's going to *actually* ruin it if you continue to think that. You're only ever going to look back at this time as what you think you lost and not enjoy it as your baby's first weeks. Take the time now, the baby's 7 weeks old, he's still young and you have so so much time left with him, your MIL might've \"stolen\" some time from you but she didn't steal your chance to bond with the baby. Maybe if you accept that then you'll be able to look at the situation with your MIL differently. She's still being annoying and not accepting your boundaries, and she absolutely needs to, but maybe there's some leeway here.", "NTA. But I don't think it's necessary to ban her completely. \n\nIt's absolutely fine to not want the help she's giving. There's *no way* I would think helping new parents means hogging the baby and making them do all the household labour. And I wouldn't be putting up with a grown adult throwing a tantrum and driving family away because they think they're special and exempt from the rules.\n\nThat being said, she thought she was helping. When she ignored you, you rightfully established boundaries. Supervised visits on *your* schedule is the answer here. Leave her in time out for a while. Then make it clear that the ban will resume if she won't respect your parenting.", "NTA - you\u2019re not an AH for this. Its your baby and she clearly was way too hands on and not a help. \n\nBut I dont think \u201cbanning\u201d her works. Because that really will cause a big falling out. And whats your end game? Ban her until when? \n\nYa\u2019ll need to communicate about this and come to an understanding", "NTA. your MIL is acting like a narcissist. you are the primary caregiver, so this is the only bond that matters in these early stages. once you realized this, you and your husband both communicated what you needed multiple times and she did not listen. she needs to back off and you should do your best not to feel any guilt about it because it is what's best for your baby. you don't need to call her to tell her she ruined things, but if she keeps guilt tripping you and your husband, continue to repeat your boundaries and ignore further guilt tripping. if she declines your offers, that is on her.", "I'm not going to come in with judgement here because this is too sensitive to call anyone out.\n\nI'm the mama to number 6 who is my first living baby for context. Doesn't mean I know you're thoughts or feelings, but also gives some idea of how it's different from the usual.\n\nI think emotions are heightened from all sides but I sympathise with MIL. You're with your family, she's allowed to be there. \n\nYou have admitted she's a huge help and you're able to sleep more than usual. \n\nWhen family comes by, you refuse to let her hold the baby she's helped with due to germs. She's already done that when it suited you and now you're taking it away. \n\nAgain, won't judge but even if she's the worst, your actions aren't kind to her. \n\nI really needed the perinatal services to make me see similar things. You may be alright, but if you have any doubts, reach out.", "You are doing great! This is not a you issue. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. Your MIL is behaving appallingly and seems to forget whose baby your child is. If she\u2019s being horrible to your family, stop inviting her to things full stop. The consequence is no one\u2019s fault but her own. Once you start enforcing boundaries maybe she will calm down, but remember you don\u2019t owe her a relationship is she can\u2019t follow basic instructions without trying to emotionally manipulate you.\n\nCongrats of your baby! NTA", "You would not BTA. \n\nShe is not respecting your boundaries and trying to guilt trip you into getting her way. You are doing nothing wrong and her feelings are hers alone to deal with. This is your special time and your journey. \n\nAlso, kudos to your husband for supporting you and handling his mother.", "NTA. your baby, your rules, and she clearly doesn't respect your wishes. feeding him from a bottle secretly?????? NO NO NO, get that lady out your house.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband lost your newborn bonding time. I am actually shocked that you don\u2019t have PPD.", "I can\u2019t pass a judgment on this but I think you need to take a step back and try to be objective. Your MIL was just trying to help. Most new parents would give anything for that kind of assistance. It wasn\u2019t working for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should cancel future visits. If you\u2019re struggling to bond with the baby, that\u2019s not her fault. Also, if your grandmother left the Christmas gathering early instead of asking your MIL if there was a problem, that not your MIL\u2019s fault either. I can see some clear incidents where she overstepped, but none of them warrant depriving your child of a relationship with his grandmother.", "YTA. Sorry, but it's up to you to set rules and see that they're followed (or set consequences if they're not). Your \"experience of being a mum\" is on-going - try to focus on all the wonderful parts and stop worrying about this. \n\nThere is zero reason to phone up your MIL and lay into her (unless you DO want to burn bridges)! Your husband has already explained the new rules to her.", "YTA, nothing more to say.", "YWBTA. \n\nYou are going through a lot right now- hormones all over the place plus MIL trampling all over you and sulking. \n\nIt sounds though like your husband has your back and has stood by your side in making decisions regarding your baby. Let him continue to handle his own mom because, honestly, all that a phone call will do is give you a temporary sense of satisfaction. Focus on moving forward- I promise you that your bonding chances with baby are still there, especially now that you\u2019ve taken a step back from her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she wants to pout and sulk and distance herself...wow, how quiet it will be :D   \n  I would be cheerful and pretend none of this ever happened. Offer what you want to offer as far as time and baby visiting and then the ball is in her court. If she'd rather have no time than what time you offer, that is on her. If she complains, I would Pollyanna the shit outta her and say that you know she wants what is best for her grandbaby and that is lots of time with her parents as you all adjust to being a new adorable family of 3. Your family will get over her tantrums, your motherhood experience is NOT ruined, and it is fine if she sees the baby, when and how you want because you are the mama.", "NTA this is your child not hers and she isn't respecting your boundaries, even going as far as to emotionally manipulate you. Life isn't a all or nothing, and she needs to understand that she can't replace you. I say call her bluff. If she wants nothing to do with your child because she isn't allowed to cross boundaries then fine, let her do her all or nothing. If she wants to act like an adult and meet half way wirh the options you've given her then great but she HAS to respect your boundaries and do not allow her to cross them.", "Agreed!  You have decades ahead of you, with this child.  Lots of firsts, lots and lots.\n\nShe didn\u2019t \u201cruin your experience of being a mum\u201d - unless you choose to frame it in that light and dwell on that, like a sore that you can\u2019t stop picking at.\n\nYou\u2019ve established your boundaries, and your husband is backing you 100%.  This is the first fruits of being a mum.  Relish it, and don\u2019t look back.\n\nNTA.", "Exactly this!  Humans aren\u2019t ducklings, bonds are formed over an extended period. The only way she can ruin your bonding experience if you give her the mental real estate to do so. Just focus on the things that you are loving doing with baby and don\u2019t give her previous actions another thought. \n\nPro tip, however: Over the next 18 years or so you will need to get good at accepting situations as they are, not as how you thought they would be, or you will drive yourself (and hubby and child) bonkers.", "This!  Look, I was adopted.  My mom didn't get to hold me until I was nearly a year old, but I still bonded with her.  So focus on that *now*, at 7 weeks.  Don't let the resentment take up space in your head - it will be bad for you and for your family.", "I agree it\u2019s too harsh - I\u2019m just not sure what else to say. My family are all upset by her ignoring them all on Christmas (literally, looking away when spoken to, and got in the car without saying goodbye to anyone except my husband). Especially after they went to a lot of effort to cook & host, and she turned up empty handed. We don\u2019t want her in the house a) to protect my family - who are all mad at her, b) to protect me from the baby hogging and c) to protect our baby, as she socialises A LOT and goes to loads of places where she could catch a bug. Baby spent 23&24 Dec in hospital hence the germ rule. He was also premature so more vulnerable. The germ rule was communicated in advance and applies to everyone, including my whole family. His family was 6 people, so it was a large xmas gathering. \n\nThe reason I want to talk to her is because I don\u2019t think she gets why she\u2019s in a time out and thinks we\u2019re just being mean. Like you said, she thought she was helpful, but since she left I finally feel able to breathe and spend time with my baby without him being whisked out of my arms. It\u2019s such a relief.", "No way she thought she was helping\u2014 Having a brand new mother do the house work, while Grandma spends the day bonding with the baby?", "You make an excellent point!\n\nThe \"ban\" is a knee-jerk reaction that really doesn't solve anything.", "Yes, I agree. I'm the mom to two and I don't want to invalidate OPs feelings, and it is a sensitive area, but the post partum time, especially with the first baby are absolutely brutal emotionally.   \nI also felt highly protective of my baby and frustrated with anyone who entered the bubble. It sounds like the MIL is a person who wants to be helpful, is excited about the baby and is trying to respect boundaries in an emotionally heightened time.  \nI think it is fine to bond as an immediate family, but cutting MIL out more does not seem warranted. I'd rather say something like \"MIL we love you and are so thankful for the help you have provided and how excited you are to participate in the life of Baby. We underestimated the emotional toll of postpartum and feel like we want to just nest as a small family for a little while as the dust settles. We are sorry if we have not communicated this gracefully. We want you to be a part of babys life - please give us some grace as we work through this as a small family\"", "But she isn\u2019t respecting the new rules. When you set boundaries and someone breaks through them, it\u2019s okay to say you need a break.", "I kinda agree, and I have a 14 month old\u2026.it is up to you and your husband to determine what type of help you want after a baby. People come to help and you give them a list of things that would be useful.", "But it sounds like you already have talked to her - she just chose not to hear what you were saying. Given that, I think maybe it's time for the three of you (hub, mil, & you) to spend a therapy session or two on this issue, with a therapist who's well versed in family issues and people who refuse to hear what's being said. \n\nI don't think that you & husband telling her is going to get through, but her having to listen and maybe re-state what you've said with a therapist present might work. \n\nI mean, if you feel you haven't explained it fully, sure, try again - but thousands of Internet strangers understood exactly what the problem is just from this post, so I don't think the problem is you not being clear about things. It's that she isn't interested in listening to what you have to say, and that's going to keep being a problem unless and until it's addressed (and quite possibly for a long time thereafter).", "Totally agree. Plus, OP is staying with her family, MIL probably is trying to be supportive. The feeding thing even could be attempt at kindness to let new parents sleep. I think MIL is trying to help, OP is used to how their parents do this and is not appreciating the help right now. \nNot the time to burn bridges, this is the time for the parents to survive and so many of us regret the things they've not appreciated at the time.\n\nMy daughter is 4 1/2 now and I regret not taking up every babysitting offer to just sleep. Even now!", "Feeding an infant a bottle when the mom is attempting to breastfeed is a huge no-no as it can create nipple confusion.I\u2019ll is expectorated from bottles much easier/faster than from a nipple which is why babies that are given bottles along with breastfeeding too early will often go on to reject the nipple. It happened with our premie and was devastating for me, and also a huge pain as I then needed to pump and feed for almost a year which is way more tiring than breastfeeding"]}
