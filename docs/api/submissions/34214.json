My parents both work full-time so my MIL came to stay for the first couple of weeks to support us. I spent 4 nights in hospital, so having the help seemed a good idea. She enabled us to get more sleep, and helped us with feeds/changes whilst I figured out household stuff. After 4 days of this, I realised it wasn\u2019t the help I wanted. I wanted to be with my baby doing nappies/feeds, and have some alone time with him. I needed MIL to do the dishwasher, cooking, boring stuff. I tried to approach this diplomatically, e.g. asking her to do a change at 7AM and then put him to sleep back in our bedroom so that we\u2019d wake up when he next cried and start our day as a family. Several times my husband and I woke up at midday with no baby in the room, and she told us it\u2019s because he wouldn\u2019t \u201csettle\u201d and we needed the sleep. This got gradually got worse, with her ignoring direct instructions from us (I.e. don\u2019t feed the baby from a bottle), and so we decided to implement some boundaries. \n\nWe went out for the afternoon just the 3 of us (me, him, baby) and when we came back she was visibility upset and sulky with us. So then when we went out again we felt guilted into bringing her along. \n\nWhen she finally left, I felt she\u2019d completely pushed me to the side and taken away my opportunity to bond - which was especially devestating after our losses. We decided to give it some time before seeing her again. My husband and I agreed to cancel future \u201chelp\u201d but didn\u2019t want to ruin Christmas so waited until after to tell her. His whole family came for Christmas and due to our worries about germs we implemented a no-one holds the baby rule (except us). She spent the whole day sulking and ignoring my family, which resulted in my Granny (F84) leaving after 1hr because she thought she\u2019d offended her and didn\u2019t want to spoil the day. \n\nShe then text my husband after, saying she was heartbroken seeing the baby and not being able to hold him. He then told her future visits were cancelled as we want to parent solo and bond as a family, but offered meeting for walks halfway. She declined, saying it was too painful to see and not hold the baby, as she had spent a magical time with him and missed him so much.\n\nI feel really sad for my husband as his mum is now isolating herself from my family. I\u2019ve tried to be diplomatic and not create drama. But she\u2019s been a huge distraction from our first 7 weeks of parenthood and I am desperate to phone her up and say that she\u2019s ruined my experience of being a mum, been horrible to my family and owes them an apology, and I don\u2019t want her seeing the baby anymore. WIBTA? How can I handle this better? It\u2019s important to my husband that our baby has a relationship with his mum so don\u2019t want to burn bridges.\n\nEDIT: just answering a few questions that have been coming up.\n\n1. The ban is until she apologises to us/my family and stops sulking. This would (hopefully) only be like a month? Not a permanent ban.\n\n2. Baby is premature and spent the days leading up to Christmas in hospital as he was sick. This is why we implemented the ban then, as we were super worried about having so many people from around the country in the house. We didn\u2019t start the rule as soon as he was born, although we didn\u2019t allow visitors in hospital and it was only my parents and MIL who held baby in those first few weeks. This ban includes my parents - they\u2019ve not held baby since he came back from hospital (although it does feel extreme as they haven\u2019t left the house much, but it\u2019s easier to apply the same rules for everyone to - lol - avoid conflict).\n\n3. I know lots of people are saying that I have plenty of time to bond with my baby, and I absolutely know that and can\u2019t wait for our future together. But I\u2019ve lost a lot of babies before this, including one very late in pregnancy. I\u2019ve dreamt about these first few weeks with a living baby for years. It may seem dramatic, but I truly never dared let myself believe I\u2019d bring a living baby home from hospital, and I\u2019m devastated I didn\u2019t advocate for myself for in those first 2 weeks so I could spend every second with him. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that MIL spent more time with baby that me - I felt like all I did was feed (whilst being watched / criticised by her - super invasive) and then got baby confiscated to be burped and cuddled by someone else. It was heartbreaking.", "created_utc": 1704238356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18x3yqz/wibta_for_banning_my_mil_from_seeing_my_baby/", "score": 248, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wish you the best of luck, congratulations on your baby!", "NTA it's your child and you're allowed to set boundaries buuut you keep saying she 'ruined your experience of being a mum' and she took away your bond with the baby which is quite dramatic and I think you're seriously doing *yourself* a disservice by having this mindset. You're so hung up on the idea that it's all been ruined for you that it's going to *actually* ruin it if you continue to think that. You're only ever going to look back at this time as what you think you lost and not enjoy it as your baby's first weeks. Take the time now, the baby's 7 weeks old, he's still young and you have so so much time left with him, your MIL might've \"stolen\" some time from you but she didn't steal your chance to bond with the baby.

And I wouldn't be putting up with a grown adult throwing a tantrum and driving family away because they think they're special and exempt from the rules.\n\nThat being said, she thought she was helping. When she ignored you, you rightfully established boundaries. Supervised visits on *your* schedule is the answer here. Leave her in time out for a while.

Doesn't mean I know you're thoughts or feelings, but also gives some idea of how it's different from the usual.\n\nI think emotions are heightened from all sides but I sympathise with MIL. You're with your family, she's allowed to be there. \n\nYou have admitted she's a huge help and you're able to sleep more than usual. \n\nWhen family comes by, you refuse to let her hold the baby she's helped with due to germs.

Most new parents would give anything for that kind of assistance. It wasn\u2019t working for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should cancel future visits. If you\u2019re struggling to bond with the baby, that\u2019s not her fault. It\u2019s not yours either. Motherhood is a journey. You have to be patient with the process. I can see some clear incidents where she overstepped, but none of them warrant depriving your child of a relationship with his grandmother.", "YTA.

It sounds like the MIL is a person who wants to be helpful, is excited about the baby and is trying to respect boundaries in an emotionally heightened time.  \nI think it is fine to bond as an immediate family, but cutting MIL out more does not seem warranted.

Focus on your baby and making your situation as supportive as it can be. Ignore your MIL's immature nonsense because her feelings on this truly do not matter.

If she has other example except for that and the fact that she was \u201csulking\u201d, I might understand but that\u2019s basically the extend of the issue.\n\nShe didn\u2019t get to bond because she admitted happily RELIED on help to SLEEP the first 2 weeks and now is annoyed grandma held the baby more during that time\u2026 because that\u2019s is basically what she is saying in the end.", "I\u2019d rather a MIL just be useless than actively hindering/hogging my bonding time with my infant.", "THIS!!!!! \nThis is your child. Either MIL gets on board with you and your husband as the parents, or she stays in time out until she does.  \n\nYou feel like you\u2019re being harsh, but if you give an inch MIL takes a mile. MILs behaviour has forced you to take a very firm stand.\n\nNTA", "Yes. That she refers to her \u201cmagical time\u201d with OP\u2019s baby makes it clear that she knew she was hogging the bonding activities.", "Thank you, I needed to hear this and am grateful for you sharing your experience.", "\"This is YOUR baby, not hers\"\n\nTherein lies the problem. MIL disagrees.", "She will absolutely form her own bonding moments going forward. Every parent who\u2019s had a baby in Nicu has also found ways to bond. Instead of focusing on the lost time in the beginning and developing PPD it would be helpful to focus on the future and the good moments that are still to come.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on OP to have a therapy session with a premature 7 week old after multiple miscarriages because MIL doesn\u2019t listen or understand boundaries, that can come later.", "She took the baby. If you help you take the housework. OP isn\u2019t over reacting, MIL is manipulative, controlling and selfish", "Because having bottles and formula is a good way to make a new mum feel calm and be sure to have a way of feeding the baby. Which ironically improves the potential of being able to breastfeed.", "We bought it in advance in case I couldn\u2019t breastfeed. We didn\u2019t want to have a crisis at 2AM if I didn\u2019t have enough milk or baby couldn\u2019t latch and for him to go hungry. \n\nThe no hold rule was only implemented after baby spent a period of time in hospital, and they have not held baby since then. Same rule for everyone.", "Saying most women take care of their babies alone is absolutely untrue. In most countries and cultures new moms have lots of help from family and friends. I\u2019m Mexican-American and the idea of being alone with a new baby is a foreign concept. I had my mom, grandmother, and father staying with us for the first month (my wife was working and otherwise I would have been alone with a new baby 2 days after delivery). My best friend is from the south here in the US and she was available to come over to cook and clean for me any time I needed. My Vietnamese MIL brought us food and offered to come over any time we needed.", "FWIW I don't think she should be banned either. I think it is reasonable to put her in the penalty box and then allow her back on the ice (so to speak) with an understanding that the parents' boundaries are honored.", "It makes it sound like MIL was bonding with HER BABY amd only sees OP as an incubator and is now chucking a two year old tantrum because \"the incubator\" won't give her back \"her baby\".\n\nMIL needs help and I would be making therapy part of the condition to see OPs baby again bit it would be hard to hold MIL to that since the only way would be family therapy and that would give MIL what she wants \"access to her baby\" not being apart of her grandchild's life.", "HOLD. YOUR. BOUNDARY. \n\nMy heart breaks for you. I had a very very very small boundary violation (MIL didn\u2019t bring baby back overnight because she thought I needed rest but I was upset when I woke up because my baby wasn\u2019t in my room) and I STILL think about it almost eight years later. STILL. \n\nHold your boundaries. She knew EXACTLY what she was doing. It sounds like your husband is right there with you in all of this which is FANTASTIC. Going forward, let him be the defense and handle his family. You focus on healing, dealing with the hormones, getting everyone used to breastfeeding and such, and ENJOY THAT BABY.", "HOLD YOUR BOUNDARIES. She is treating you like an incubator and you're not, you are the child's mother. She had her turn to be a mother and raised your husband now she needs to step aside and let him and you bond with your own baby.", "Meh, this shouldn\u2019t have been a tough situation to begin with.  OP is living with her parents but still needs housework help?  I mean she has a husband there too, right?  No argument that MIL should be doing whatever, not just the \u201cfun\u201d stuff, but it seems like OP didn\u2019t handle any of this well and is possibly an unreliable narrator.", "Ignore this person, OP. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about", "Absolutely ...PLUS they asked her not to and THEY are the parents!", "So MIL didn\u2019t need to go! If anything just shows more how disingenuous she was, no one wants someone to take over with their new child whilst the clean", "We don\u2019t actually know how things went down.  The whole situation is just weird to me.  I had twins, was hospitalized for two weeks afterwards, and still didn\u2019t have anyone coming in to help me when we finally went home.  Being attached to a bed for two weeks is a traumatic non-bonding event.  Having a MIL who takes a baby and keeps it quiet after you\u2019ve had it all night long so that you can nap for four hours?  That\u2019s not a traumatic non-bonding event.  Did no bonding happen in the night?  The examples being given just don\u2019t add up to the overreaction being presented.", "It\u2019s not an overreaction. What you\u2019re saying is inconsistent, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s reasonable for the mother to be prevented from holding her child for most of the day but then unreasonable for the grandmother to endure the same? That makes zero sense. Only being able to hold your own kid when it suits MIL is not bonding and having a woman who is hostile to you take over your house and decide how you parent can actually be traumatic.\n\nYour anecdote reminds me of people who comment \u2018My parents never gave me anything for my 16th birthday! I have no sympathy that people are moaning about unfairness when I\u2019d have loved a gift card!\u2019 On threads where someone complains their brother got a new car and the got a $200 gift card. Just because what you went through might be worse in many ways, doesn\u2019t mean OP has no right to be upset.\n\nThere is also no reason to disbelieve the ban and that the parents were not holding the child. You really don\u2019t think MIL is wrong for coming into their home on the pretext of helping and then ignoring their direct instructions regarding how to look after their child? And then deliberately creating an atmosphere until they felt the need to include her in the little bonding they could do before she left (like the walk) and again, at Christmas when she offended OP\u2019s family? Making the birth of their baby about her is v unsupportive"]}
