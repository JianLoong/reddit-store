{"id": 23686, "submission_id": "15fwkmk", "title": "AITA for losing my temper after having to repeat myself?", "selftext": "I was having dinner earlier today and sitting at the table with my dad, who was on his iPad with 1 earbud in. For context, my dad is not hard of hearing in any way, and we had casually conversed probably within 1-2 minutes of this incident happening. My mom is currently out of town and having some dental work done, which requires multiple follow ups to make sure everything is in order. Because of this, we are unsure when she will be back home, though it could be after any of the weekly follow ups (when she gets the OK from her dentist).\n\nToday, I asked my dad if he knew when my mom's next appointment was, which he didn't respond to. I wait about 15 seconds, then asked again, this time louder. Again, he doesn't respond, so I say \"huh?\" but much quieter, which finally gets him to look up and he goes \"huh?\" back to me. I wasn't annoyed yet at this point, so I asked the question again, and he goes \"huh?\" again back to me. At this point I am mildly annoyed, but not a big deal still, so I ask again for the fourth time. This time, he responds but starts explaining to me that they need multiple follow ups and the dental office needs to order the materials. All of this I already knew, and he knows that I am aware, but it still didn't really answer my question. I respond and say \"Yes, I know, I'm asking if you know when her next visit is going to be.\".\n\nMy dad then begins repeating exactly what he had just said before, to which I interrupt him this time and say \"Yes, but when is she going to see the dentist next?\". Again, my dad starts repeating the same response, which pretty much triggered me at this point (I know it isn't a good thing to get mad at something small and I should try to be better about that). So I respond in something like an angry half-yell, \"Yes, I know, but that isn't what I'm asking!! I'm asking when is she going to visit the dentist next, do you know when her next appointment is?!?!\" (seventh time I've asked). My dad gets mad and starts saying I have a temper, and I respond \"I don't care what you think, how often do I act like this to you or even get mad?\", which to be honest is true as I almost never raise my voice towards my parents. He doesn't say anything, so I say \"I know they need to order the stuff for mom, what I'm asking is do you know when she will be at the dentist next, when is her appointment?\" (eighth time at this point). He finally answers my question and goes \"How should I know?\". He talks to her on the phone and texts her multiple times a day, everyday, which is the reason I was asking him if he knew.\n\nMy dad continues and says \"So what if you have to repeat yourself?\", and I go \"I shouldn't have to ask something 8 times, and even though clearly there was some sort of misunderstanding you never even bothered to take out your earbud or pause your video, and instead just going \"huh?\" or repeating the same answer to me that clearly wasn't helpful if I continued to ask you afterwards.\". My dad then gets up and leaves saying it was my fault.\n\nEdit: Grammar", "created_utc": 1690944041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fwkmk/aita_for_losing_my_temper_after_having_to_repeat/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad sounds annoying. I would\u2019ve been frustrated too. Repeating something once or twice is fine. 8 times is excessive. He made a big deal out of something that could\u2019ve been answered in 15 seconds had he actually been listening.", "So...your parents are going through a separation. You know that, right?", "NTA.\n\nJust a suggestion though: texting your mom directly asking about those details bc you care might make her feel loved. It sounds kinda serious and lonely if she doesn't have her family so sending those vibes to her could make a big difference; could feel like a lot of psychological support and strength for her to handle whatever medical stuff she's got to face. That's a very real thing that's been proven in so many studies: people reaching out and communicating with care and love creates a kind of shield strength against awful things happening in life, things like illnesses, injuries, awful accidents, etc.\n\nGiant tangent that has nothing to do with you (I'm sure you're awesome and your dad sounds like a git) but in my early 20s I had a friend whose mom went to a hospital near him (*not* near her though; she was in the suburbs) for a scheduled surgery. He didn't go visit her even though he was totally free that day.\n\nI found out by kind of slowly unpacking the situation while we were hanging out and I was dumbfounded. How do you just... not go see your mom when she's in hospital? Especially when she's only like 10 mins' public transit away?\n\nThere wasn't a secret story of abuse, either. He loved his parents and they'd always treated him really well. He just didn't think it was serious enough to warrant him going down to see her.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I wonder if he was on the autism spectrum. Apparently his dad - and even his mom - were explicitly like \"please go see her/me post-surgery\" beforehand. He blew them off. But then when I was like \"you didn't go see her!?\" totally flabbergasted, he tried to defend his reasoning but I think it really sunk in that he'd done something super f'd up...", "NTA. Hope your Mom is ok! Dental surgery and having to go away from home for awhile fo it is really hard. \n\nI would also assume this would be information he would know? Being her husband and all. But also super rude eating together and hes actually ignoring you.", "Nta. You were patient! I lose my temper after 2 repetitions :p", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I ended up forgetting to ask while on the phone since we were so busy talking about other stuff. I figured I would ask my dad first to see if he knew rather than bother her with another phone call/text, but I see what you mean about letting people know you care about them. It's a great gesture, and very thoughtful of you to suggest!", "Hey, thanks so much! She's doing well, it's mostly a cosmetic thing. Yeah, my parents are very close and my dad had actually gone up there to stay with her for the first week after the surgery.

That is some pretty crazy dental work, especially when you say \"dental work\" and not some sort of major oral surgery. Like you go into a lot of detail here, but on detail there.\n\nAnd then you have your dad that is obviously **super** agitated at something. His wife of nearly 40 years is off having major surgery for some unknown amount of time so he's a little testy, but to just kind of be like [well...bye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0BTdo6qGwo) says there's something more there.\n\n* Take everything as if you're parents are heading towards a divorce.\n\nYour dad is testy because his wife of nearly 40 years is leaving him. He isn't really ignoring you, there's just a lot on his mind. He's made up this crazy dental work story because he doesn't want to tell you why your mom isn't in the house. People get divorced well into their 60's+ and after 40 years of marriage.\n\nLooking at the two situations, that separation one makes more sense to me. I hope I'm wrong or perhaps just completely misunderstanding what you're saying but that's just what immediately screamed out at me after reading only the first paragraph. You make it sound as if your mom is away for an indefinite amount of time because of \"dental work\".", "Sir/maam. You have too much time on your hands.
