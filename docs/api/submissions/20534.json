Our son was supposed to be in bed and asleep for a couple hours by now, but apparently he woke up and walked out to go use the bathroom right when a character loudly said \"Fuck.\"\n\nWe had the volume lower than normal, but he still heard it. I tried my best to get him back to bed calmly but he kept asking what it meant. I told him it's bad word he shouldn't say and that he doesn't need to know what it means.\n\nApparently that only made him more curious. It's been about a day later and we've threatened and given out as many punishments as we can think of. \"Sit in a corner\" \"We'll take your video games\" \"We wont let friends come over\" etc. But he won't stop saying it and / or asking what it means.\n\nWell, me and my girlfriend wanted to go out to eat. Usually, we would take our son with us, however we decided that we probably shouldn't, as he might say it in public or even to someone, or ask someone what it meant. I don't want to deal with that or have to explain it to someone. I especially don't want to be kicked out of a place because our son is constantly saying obscenities.\n\nSo for the first time since he was like, two, we got a baby sitter. Not a complete stranger, one of our friends that my son has met many times. I knew he wouldn't be happy, but he just refused to stop inquiring about the new word he just learned.\n\nHe was very upset with not getting to go to dinner. I told him that we would bring him back food and wouldn't be gone long and that our friend would watch a movie with him or play with him, whatever he wanted. He wasn't having it.\n\nWe were only gone for two hours and apparently when we were gone, all he did was sit in his room and pout. He did eventually get bored and come out to watch TV, but was still visibly upset.\n\nNow we're home, and we've made some progress. He seems to be mostly over his fascination with the word. Regardless, he's still mad about not getting to go out.

What worked for you doesn\u2019t mean it should or would work for him. \n\n2. Kids can learn about reproductive health. You could\u2019ve just said \u201cIt\u2019s a word that means making a baby, but it\u2019s not usually a good word to use, and it\u2019s actually really rude.\u201d That way you explained a little but got to the heart of the topic which is that the word isn\u2019t safe to use in public.

If you would've actually talkd to him instead of just punishing him for it, he would've stopped saying it much sooner.

I can't tell you though.\" You would want to know even more what that is.\n\nI think instead of the punishments you could consider having some fun with him and looking at replacement swear words.

You can not wear it\" with no further explanation and everyone who wears blue or asks why is put into prison, given fines and other punishments, would that be acceptable or a sufficient way to give this information? Would you want your son to follow it blindly or would you want him to think for himself? I'm not saying it's the exact same thing, but it's the closest thing I could think of.  He's not trying to be rude or anything, he just wants to learn. He's learning about the world right now, he doesn't know why it's a bad word and he's just asking questions because he wants to understand the world better, that's a good thing.\n\nYou WANT them to learn to ask questions, to not just believe everything anyone says. Basically you spent the day trying to get rid of his natural critical thinking skills. In all the time you spend punishing him, you could've just discussed with your partner a way to explain to him why he couldn't say the word or have a conversation with him. Instead you spent all day punishing him for thinking critically and asking questions.", "YTA\n\nExplain to him what it means. He'll hear it a lot anyway unless you keep him locked away.\n\nAlso punishments are a very inefficient parenting tool. Look into some courses or books on respectful parenting.", "YTA\n\nYou've completely dismissed his questions bout what it means and why it's bad. \n\nHe has no concept of what it means or why it's bad because you won't tell him, yet you still punish him for it.\n\n\"Because I said so\" is a shitty excuse for anything.", "Well kind of YTA on this one.  My issues is that you told him it was a bad word.  Instead of telling him it's a \"bad word\" break it down a bit better, tell him that word carries so many different meanings because all words it depends on when it's being used, but in public most people don't like to hear it, so please don't use it so people don't feel uncomfortable.", "Tell him what it means making your definition so that it\u2019s appropriate for his age.  Let him know it\u2019s a swear word that grownups sometimes use but it\u2019s not nice.  And kids can\u2019t use the word at all.  You\u2019re going overboard about this and creating a drama when it should have over all ready. It\u2019s amazing that he got to 7 years old without hearing it.  Just relax.

I'm thinking you could say 'dang it' instead, or do you have a suggestion? Let's think what works.\"\n\nYTA. Your kid is 7 and curious. You're punishing them for being curious. And demanding things from your child without attempting alternatives or actually talking about it with them? Not helpful.", "YTA\n\nI really don\u2019t understand why people seem to think it\u2019s a good idea to shelter children from the meanings and proper uses of swear words (which are a perfectly normal system of emotional expression) only to give them complete free rein with them at age 18 and hope they don\u2019t get punched in the face when they offend someone due to not knowing how to use them.", "It's YOUR fault and you're punishing HIM? YTA.", "I am not assuming you didn't do this, maybe you did. Sitting down with him and explaining that it's not a word that you use around people and that he shouldn't use may have worked better. If you blew up and started punishing immediately then he just learnt that the word has a lot of power and gets an immediate reaction and attention.\nHe is 7 not a baby,", "YTA. Tell him what it means and why it can be rude to say it all the time. I have a 9 year old, and vary rarely do I ever say \"It's none of your business\" in order to get him to stop asking me a question. Answer him! Give him details. Explain it and build some trust so that the next time he has a question, he knows he can ask you and get a real answer. \n\nI would leave my kid home if he wouldn't stop shouting out profanity in public, but that's still on you for not teaching him properly and ANSWERING his questions.", "YTA for fighting against judgements. Be better.", "YTA you could have handled that way differently.  You could have easily said it's a word children shouldn't use and it refers to an adult situation.  \n\nAlso what kind of person punishes a child for being curious.  If you wont teach him someone will and I promise it won't be the person you want.", "YTA. And you're making it worse as well, kids at that age are testing boundaries to see what in their world is okay, not okay and general curiosity of what things mean and how they work.   \n\nBy shutting down the conversation and just punishing him you are making the curiosity grow each time and he will keep saying it until give a real reason (not some punishment) not to do it, or you can incite fear and distrust that your kid can't come to you with his curiosity and questions if that's what you prefer (good luck when that follows into teenhood)\n\nMy son is about to be 6 and has gone through testing out plenty of bad words, lasts about a week of telling him that's not a nice word after he says it and telling him proper use of it, my kid is rare verbal so it's not the easiest thing to deal with but if he's not using words against someone then it's not a huge situation that needs punishment of any form and eventually he lets go of it except for the occasional \"shit\" he slips when dropping his favorite toy.", "Ut Oh, boy do you have a problem. Your mistake was in telling him that it is a bad word. He may have a rebellious steak in him that you just discovered.

These were my  Mormon foster family by the way. And my foster mother said don\u2019t say anything about it. Don\u2019t react to it. Just ignore it.

You could compare it to a word he says when he\u2019s mad, like \u2018crap\u2019 or whatever it is in your situation.

He explained that he'd seen essentially all the G or PG ones, but of course hadn't seen this or that one because of their rating, \"i mean, those are totally inappropriate for kids.\" Matter of fact. And this kid's smart, was probably ten or eleven at the time, but definitely of advanced intelligence. His parents and i disagree about basically everything socially and politically because they're post-pentecostal charismatic, prosperity-gospel sheep who base their lives on what a whole line of white, male people with an eye towards social control and no understanding of scholarship have said the Bible says.

It's pretty normal a 7 year old would want to test out the word that got *such* a reaction from his parents - you can take the wind out of his sails by not reacting so much, getting upset or letting him wield the power. My approach with kids and swears is to tell them frankly that there are certain situations that call for them, but that overusing them, especially in public, just makes us sound less intelligent and like less nice people.

They need to understand why they shouldn't do things. Empathy is a secondary emotion, one that you are not born with, but one that you have to learn. To learn things you must be taught, and it's your parents job to teach you things like that.

It falls on you as a parent to be able to explain the world to him to the best of your knowledge.  Don't punish him for being inquisitive.\n\nEventually, he's going to learn that swearing is part of everyday language for the majority of the world.  I've been swearing since around his age (i'm 37 now) and my mother wasn't really all that fussed (though she would tell me off because off the social stigma around people expressing themselves using words).  She understood swearing is nothing but a form of expression - it doesn't make you a bad person.  It's the social pressure that makes swearing, as a form of expression, seem like a bad thing.\n\nThe reason swearing is publicly frowned upon is because some people are sensitive to other humans expressing themselves and how they feel.  Like saying \"fuck!\" as a way of expressing frustration.  It stems from an old fashioned an out dated religious and conservative mindset and era, where it was discouraged to express yourself in public.\n\nI really don't see the problem with swearing.

I tell him it's okay when he's with us and in that type of situation, but he'll get in big trouble if he uses those words in front of his parents (or teachers, or his friends' parents).", "This is pretty close to the lesson I got from my mum 25+ years ago. She didn\u2019t massively like swearing (or so she claimed\u2026. For someone who does now say shit and fuck a reasonable amount. Don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve just softened her to them or she was just saying that because we were kids) and would gently reprimand us in the house as kids and remind us \u2018it\u2019s not pleasant\u2019 (so British). But she also helped us to understand that how bad those words are is also context dependent - which is how the worst word me or any of my cousins ever said in front of my grandma was \u2018fart\u2019 which is how she ended up telling the vicar my 7ish year old cousin (20 years ago) \u2018uses the F word\u2019. She also helped us to understand that swearing and swearing AT someone are different too. Then as we became teenagers and adults reprimanded us less and less for our language in the house, whilst still maintaining tighter boundaries out of the house. It was not at all hard to understand. This is exactly how I would approach it in our house with the added level of \u2018there are some words that come from a place of hatred towards people that look a certain way or share a certain set of characteristics (as a disabled gay person I think this would also be especially easy to understand why certain words are especially harmful) and we do not ever say them, even at home. They are always hurtful and unkind to say even if no one from that group is in the room - it\u2019s language that we should let disappear from the world and I will not except ever hearing those words from you once you know what they mean\u2019. The N word just literally never came up in my house (small British town, it\u2019s I believe the only swear not allowed at to be said at any time on any British TV. I think I heard it in rap or we were told it was a racist word in school) and I knew never ever to say it. Multiple disabled slurs were tolerated in my house though, and I think even in school actually, but I think that\u2019s a case of language evolving and my mum/teachers genuinely not knowing how problematic they were.\n\nAlthough I do think that for a child who will not stop saying fuck after having it explained to them that other people in public may find those words offensive or be upset by that language, especially with it coming from a child, that not being allowed to go out for dinner is actually a natural consequence. \u2018You are not behaving appropriately for a restaurant, just like we wear clothes in a restaurant there are also other ways we are expected to behave ourselves in public. Therefore you can come out to restaurants with us again when you show us you can behave in a way that will not offend the other people who are out to enjoy their meal. We will still bring you your favourite meal and you can have fun with the babysitter, but this will have to be in our house until you choose to stop saying fuck all the time.\u2019\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t have a problem answering what the word fuck means to a child, in that I think answering their natural questions as they come up is always the best way. But if you haven\u2019t had the sex conversation yet there\u2019s a lotttttt of context you have to give, beyond what the actual scope of the question was in the child\u2019s mind (how much you have discussed sex with a child of that age should really just be lead by their natural curiosity I think) so I\u2019m not quite sure how I would start with the actual explanation for that particular word! Even cunt is much simpler to explain whilst being wildly regarded as a much ruder word.", "Smart. I heard my grandma say bitch once and it\u2019s still one of my best core memories. She was usually very proper British.", "There is no rational explanation you can give a child, becuase like you pointed out the whole adult/child distinction for the words use is irrational and bizarre.\n\nThe most you can do is explain that the word is less acceptable and more jarring when coming from a child. I honestly just tell my kid that it makes me look bad when he uses it haha", "But \u2018bad words\u2019 are actually easy to understand when we think about it. They are words that we understand that some people don\u2019t like, or find upsetting or offensive, and that how \u2018bad\u2019 the word is is dependent on context. If you stub your toe on Lego in an empty room and say fuck\u2026. Cool\u2026. Good outlet. But I don\u2019t think there are many people in the world who if they met the queen would have dropped an F bomb. And so as we have already probably explained to a child that wearing no pants isn\u2019t bad, but wearing no pants in a restaurant is bad because certain places have certain rules and there are certain behaviours that will upset people. So the same applies to swear words that when used in your own house, and not directed at someone else might not be that bad, but in public are \u2018bad\u2019. And one of the contexts is that particularly some people are upset by those \u2018bad\u2019 words coming from children and even if we don\u2019t understand it it\u2019s nice to respect other people and not upset them if we can help it over something that doesn\u2019t hurt us to accommodate. And additionally that yes those \u2018bad words\u2019 might not be that bad if used around immediate family in the house, and won\u2019t result in the same level of trouble for using them, at the same time if we want to make sure that we are not using a \u2018bad\u2019 word in a place that will get us in to trouble (like school, or even work for many adults) then it\u2019s easier for us if we don\u2019t use them excessively in the house or we\u2019ll get so used to saying them they\u2019ll probably be easier to slip out where we didn\u2019t mean for them to.", "It's not \"fine\" if a kid is yelling it constantly, but a kid drops an f-bomb you aren't getting booted.

Grandma had a nice talk with the construction workers outside at the neighbors house about maybe controlling their volume between 3-5 pm when kids were outside \ud83d\ude02", "Haha that\u2019s priceless!!", ">explain why it's a bad word and what the consequences of saying it may be\n\nI did try to explain why he should not say it.He was told there would be repercussions. The kid was not listening.  \n\nIt sounds like be is not saying it anymore,  so it did some good. \n\nThis is like saying you cannot spank your kids. There are sometimes when some kids need a swat.", "Once I kid (i worked as teacher's assistant in primary school) told me they peeked into mom's book and there were many curse words. I explained it simmilarly.", "Yeah I'm Australian too. I think because swearing is so normal here, we're also a lot more open about teaching kids the appropriate use of those words rather than just outright shutting it down. One of the few things were doing right here lol", "\"They don't use those words\" Not around you, at least, lmao! On behalf of someone who was once a child, they might be using them with their friends. I know I did, even if I didn't use them properly, because they made me seem cool (in my head). And then one of my tattle tale cousins would overhear me swear and then blackmail me.", "This made me lol.", "LMFAOOOOOO I knew it", "Got it. Although i did have a little chuckle thinking you said the acronym out loud", "Honestly you could probably bypass the \u201cit\u2019s a synonym for sex\u201d explanation and go straight into \u201cits a word people use when they\u2019re angry, upset or in pain. But it\u2019s not a kind word and people don\u2019t generally appreciate others using those words\u201d", "You are going to have to get better at explaining things that aren\u2019t easy to explain. Welcome to being a parent.", "\"Its a word that refers to grown up situations and can also be used as a term of surprise or frustration, but its not a good word for you to use\" thats what my parents said to my brother. He has still never used the word", "\u201cIt means \u201chave sex\u201d but sometimes people use it to express frustration. But it\u2019s not polite and it\u2019s only adults should use it\u201d \nEasy. Hopefully he knows what sex it.", "It usually doesn't mean anything, and is just a sound people make when mad.", "Cause clearly that wasn't the case here? It's not that they were just going out on their own. Calling the babysitter was a punishment when he was originally going to go with them. Kids pick up on that stuff, and I don't know how anyone would expect a kid to not be sulking about that.", "No they don't need directions,  but they absolutely do need to know the basics. Not only does it help protect them if they know what to look for, but it also promotes an environment where children can ask their parents anything. My daughter knew the basics and body parts before the age of 7 and learned even more when our dog tried to mate a neighbour's dog. I am so thankful my daughter can and does ask and talk to me about everything as she is just coming into the teenage years. She even rats herself out for things she does wrong so we can have a discussion and find better ways to do things in the future.  It's just one small part and is a fact of life. I want her to know what's true from me me not her peers.", "with mine I never said they were bad words, I said they were curse words for adult use only, and that some adults didn't use them at all, and that they weren't appropriate in all situations. When they asked if there were children curse words we went over things like shoot and darn, but that they were still not appropriate to use in certain situations and which situations those were.  When they were teenagers they did touch base and we caveated it to be \"no cussing around your grandparents, or other adults it will offend, nor AT an adult.\" other than that free for all it never bothered me and it would be hypocritical of me when I talk like a trucker with a distinct sailor accent and a side of pirate now and again lol", "Telling them about SEX is not the same as teaching them they have body parts and teaching them they have the ability to reject hugs and touching of any kind and to tell someone if they are uncomfortable. \n\nNot sex. That is disgusting.", "A friend of mine messaged me recently, saying that her 3 year old has said \"what the fuck is this?\" when his brother handed him a half-eaten apple.\n\nThen she followed it up with \"at least he used it properly in a sentence.\"", "I mean research on child safety says you\u2019re wrong but dinosaurs gotta Dino I guess.\n\nTelling kids about the basic idea of sexual reproduction is no more salacious than telling them about how digestion works. It certainly doesn\u2019t make them want to do anything - but it makes them understand and be safer as a result.", "What\u2019s being inherited in the cycle of abuse is the maladaptive stress response, not the trauma response."]}
