Our son was supposed to be in bed and asleep for a couple hours by now, but apparently he woke up and walked out to go use the bathroom right when a character loudly said \"Fuck.\"\n\nWe had the volume lower than normal, but he still heard it. I tried my best to get him back to bed calmly but he kept asking what it meant. I told him it's bad word he shouldn't say and that he doesn't need to know what it means.\n\nApparently that only made him more curious. It's been about a day later and we've threatened and given out as many punishments as we can think of. \"Sit in a corner\" \"We'll take your video games\" \"We wont let friends come over\" etc. But he won't stop saying it and / or asking what it means.\n\nWell, me and my girlfriend wanted to go out to eat. Usually, we would take our son with us, however we decided that we probably shouldn't, as he might say it in public or even to someone, or ask someone what it meant. I don't want to deal with that or have to explain it to someone. I especially don't want to be kicked out of a place because our son is constantly saying obscenities.\n\nSo for the first time since he was like, two, we got a baby sitter. Not a complete stranger, one of our friends that my son has met many times. I knew he wouldn't be happy, but he just refused to stop inquiring about the new word he just learned.\n\nHe was very upset with not getting to go to dinner. I told him that we would bring him back food and wouldn't be gone long and that our friend would watch a movie with him or play with him, whatever he wanted. He wasn't having it.\n\nWe were only gone for two hours and apparently when we were gone, all he did was sit in his room and pout. He did eventually get bored and come out to watch TV, but was still visibly upset.\n\nNow we're home, and we've made some progress. He seems to be mostly over his fascination with the word. Regardless, he's still mad about not getting to go out.

What worked for you doesn\u2019t mean it should or would work for him. \n\n2. Kids can learn about reproductive health. You could\u2019ve just said \u201cIt\u2019s a word that means making a baby, but it\u2019s not usually a good word to use, and it\u2019s actually really rude.\u201d That way you explained a little but got to the heart of the topic which is that the word isn\u2019t safe to use in public.

If you would've actually talkd to him instead of just punishing him for it, he would've stopped saying it much sooner.

You can not wear it\" with no further explanation and everyone who wears blue or asks why is put into prison, given fines and other punishments, would that be acceptable or a sufficient way to give this information? Would you want your son to follow it blindly or would you want him to think for himself? I'm not saying it's the exact same thing, but it's the closest thing I could think of.  He's not trying to be rude or anything, he just wants to learn. He's learning about the world right now, he doesn't know why it's a bad word and he's just asking questions because he wants to understand the world better, that's a good thing.\n\nYou WANT them to learn to ask questions, to not just believe everything anyone says. Basically you spent the day trying to get rid of his natural critical thinking skills. In all the time you spend punishing him, you could've just discussed with your partner a way to explain to him why he couldn't say the word or have a conversation with him. Instead you spent all day punishing him for thinking critically and asking questions.", "YTA\n\nExplain to him what it means. He'll hear it a lot anyway unless you keep him locked away.\n\nAlso punishments are a very inefficient parenting tool. Look into some courses or books on respectful parenting.", "YTA\n\nYou've completely dismissed his questions bout what it means and why it's bad. \n\nHe has no concept of what it means or why it's bad because you won't tell him, yet you still punish him for it.\n\n\"Because I said so\" is a shitty excuse for anything.", "Well kind of YTA on this one.  My issues is that you told him it was a bad word.  Instead of telling him it's a \"bad word\" break it down a bit better, tell him that word carries so many different meanings because all words it depends on when it's being used, but in public most people don't like to hear it, so please don't use it so people don't feel uncomfortable.", "Tell him what it means making your definition so that it\u2019s appropriate for his age.  Let him know it\u2019s a swear word that grownups sometimes use but it\u2019s not nice.  And kids can\u2019t use the word at all.  You\u2019re going overboard about this and creating a drama when it should have over all ready. It\u2019s amazing that he got to 7 years old without hearing it.  Just relax.

I'm thinking you could say 'dang it' instead, or do you have a suggestion? Let's think what works.\"\n\nYTA. Your kid is 7 and curious. You're punishing them for being curious. And demanding things from your child without attempting alternatives or actually talking about it with them? Not helpful.", "YTA\n\nI really don\u2019t understand why people seem to think it\u2019s a good idea to shelter children from the meanings and proper uses of swear words (which are a perfectly normal system of emotional expression) only to give them complete free rein with them at age 18 and hope they don\u2019t get punched in the face when they offend someone due to not knowing how to use them.", "It's YOUR fault and you're punishing HIM? YTA.", "I am not assuming you didn't do this, maybe you did. Sitting down with him and explaining that it's not a word that you use around people and that he shouldn't use may have worked better. If you blew up and started punishing immediately then he just learnt that the word has a lot of power and gets an immediate reaction and attention.\nHe is 7 not a baby,", "YTA. Tell him what it means and why it can be rude to say it all the time. I have a 9 year old, and vary rarely do I ever say \"It's none of your business\" in order to get him to stop asking me a question. Answer him! Give him details. Explain it and build some trust so that the next time he has a question, he knows he can ask you and get a real answer. \n\nI would leave my kid home if he wouldn't stop shouting out profanity in public, but that's still on you for not teaching him properly and ANSWERING his questions.", "YTA for fighting against judgements. Be better.", "YTA you could have handled that way differently.  You could have easily said it's a word children shouldn't use and it refers to an adult situation.  \n\nAlso what kind of person punishes a child for being curious.  If you wont teach him someone will and I promise it won't be the person you want.", "YTA. And you're making it worse as well, kids at that age are testing boundaries to see what in their world is okay, not okay and general curiosity of what things mean and how they work.   \n\nBy shutting down the conversation and just punishing him you are making the curiosity grow each time and he will keep saying it until give a real reason (not some punishment) not to do it, or you can incite fear and distrust that your kid can't come to you with his curiosity and questions if that's what you prefer (good luck when that follows into teenhood)\n\nMy son is about to be 6 and has gone through testing out plenty of bad words, lasts about a week of telling him that's not a nice word after he says it and telling him proper use of it, my kid is rare verbal so it's not the easiest thing to deal with but if he's not using words against someone then it's not a huge situation that needs punishment of any form and eventually he lets go of it except for the occasional \"shit\" he slips when dropping his favorite toy.", "Ut Oh, boy do you have a problem. Your mistake was in telling him that it is a bad word. He may have a rebellious steak in him that you just discovered.

I dealt with swear words by telling my kids that is a swear word and you are not to use it.  End of discussion.", "One of my brothers said that really young like three or four.  These were my  Mormon foster family by the way. And my foster mother said don\u2019t say anything about it. Don\u2019t react to it. Just ignore it.

You could compare it to a word he says when he\u2019s mad, like \u2018crap\u2019 or whatever it is in your situation.

He explained that he'd seen essentially all the G or PG ones, but of course hadn't seen this or that one because of their rating, \"i mean, those are totally inappropriate for kids.\" Matter of fact. And this kid's smart, was probably ten or eleven at the time, but definitely of advanced intelligence. His parents and i disagree about basically everything socially and politically because they're post-pentecostal charismatic, prosperity-gospel sheep who base their lives on what a whole line of white, male people with an eye towards social control and no understanding of scholarship have said the Bible says.

It's pretty normal a 7 year old would want to test out the word that got *such* a reaction from his parents - you can take the wind out of his sails by not reacting so much, getting upset or letting him wield the power. My approach with kids and swears is to tell them frankly that there are certain situations that call for them, but that overusing them, especially in public, just makes us sound less intelligent and like less nice people.

Really don\u2019t get pl. saying. 7 is too young to understand 2-4, sure- kid is too young to understand. A 2nd grader?

Tell him what the word means. \"Well it's a bad work that can mean a lot of things, people say it when they are angry usually but it's not something you should say ok? Its not a very nice word.\" Cuss words are just words. The express and emotion. I'm not worried about my kids knowing the words just when to properly use them. No screaming \"fuck\" in public but if yoy stub yoyr toe and say it at home? Sure.", "You\u2019re doing this all wrong. You\u2019re building up the mystique and effectiveness of the expletive. My 3 year old called me a fucking dick the other day haha which was jarring but it\u2019s just a word. The more of a reaction he gets from it, the more power you give him from its use.", "Wow YTA. A child\u2019s curiosity is met with punishment. The poor child is probably so confused as to why he is being punished. Man, work out your issues instead of taking this out on a child.", "The more you react to a swear word, the more he will say it. Isolation is not going to teach him to not swear, it will teach him to resent you. Explain why it's a bad word and trust your kid to do the right thing.

GJ.   \n\"Apparently that only made him more curious\"   \nAHAHAHA WHO COULD HAVE GUESSED?!  \nYou're punishing your kid for mere curiosity. Terribly incompetent parenting. YTA.", "Exactly OP, YTA. The reason kids don't change their behaviour if you just punish them over and over for something is because they do not understand why it is bad. If you do not want him to do something, you need to give him a satisfactory answer as to why. \"It's a bad word\" isn't enough. He's 7, it's very likely he's heard it said elsewhere. And if other people are saying it why can't I? What does it mean? And why is that so bad? What is the word used for? Maybe give him an alternative like \"fudge\" or \"fridge\" to say - sit him down, explain it calmly, answer his questions, tell him it's not an appropriate word for a little boy to use etc. Watch how quickly he'll start listening to you compared to when he gets punished and doesn't understand why.", "I beg to differ. I\u2019ve taught 1st and 2nd grade for close to 20 years. A neurotypical 7 year old is fully capable of knowing if a word is bad and to not use it. The parents said the word was bad and to not use it. He chose to continue using it. I fully applaud this natural consequences the parent dished out. NTA.", "Thank you!", "I told him it's a bad word and not to say it? I don't get how it's different.", "I agree.  He heard a word on a program they were watching and wanted to know about it.  Punishment way out of line.", "How do I explain the definition of \"fuck\" in a child friendly way? It has multiple definitions anyway lol.", "I mean, from a young age my parents told me never to say bad words. If I ever heard one or they slipped up and said it near me, they just said it was a bad word and not to say it, so I didn't", "Kids are gonna hear swear words every now and then, it's inevitable. Happened to me, probably happened to you unless you were incredibly sheltered. \n\nBesides, I was punishing him for continuing to say it and ask about it after I said \"It's a bad word, don't say it\"", "How is that any different from what I told him?\n\nHim being curious is not the problem, and is oversimplifying it. He's being curious about something I can't explain to him, because it's inappropriate and not for kids.", "I mean, I already told him it's a bad word and not to say it. That was enough for me when my parents told me the same thing.", "We did give out punishments. I said we threatened to AND we gave them out. \n\nAnd yeah I get what you're saying. I just didn't know what to do when he kept repeating it.", "At a similar age , I watched ( at the neighbors bc I wasn\u2019t allowed ) \u201c Top Gun \u201c. Obviously I barely understood the plot. I was shocked at all the swearing as my parents taught me not to use bad words ( they modeled not cursing as well ). I was so confused as to why adults would swear so much that I asked my mom . Even with the consequence looming for seeing something I wasn\u2019t allowed to , the curiosity was so strong. My mom calmly told me that sometimes adults swear to relieve stress. That made SO much sense to me, even as a six year old . I didn\u2019t even end up with a consequence but I did now have an understanding. . It didn\u2019t make me swear more either .   I swear like a sailor on leave now but that\u2019s unrelated \ud83d\ude02", "Me too. I don\u2019t understand all these ppl saying kid is too young to understand. 2 is too young. 7 is not.", "Yeah, the way he latched onto this is weird.  Most kids learn as toddlers that you just can't say some words.  Does he know better and is just testing the boundary?\n\nThe parents must have been pretty aggressively guarding him against profanity if he made it to 7 without ever hearing a swear word, but you'd think he'd still encounter this concept in public places or from classmates.", "Weve learned a lot in 20 years. If you're still teaching 1st and 2nd graders \"this is bad, end of story\" you should probably look into some recertification training. At 7 years old, his brain is barely a quarter done cooking. He does not know why swearing is wrong and he isn't going to know why if no one tells him. Children aren't programmed with the knowledge of adults. They need to be taught. They need to understand why they shouldn't do things. Empathy is a secondary emotion, one that you are not born with, but one that you have to learn. To learn things you must be taught, and it's your parents job to teach you things like that. Having your possessions taken away and being prohibited from socialisation are not natural consequences - they are decisions. A deliberate action taken to create consequences. Manufacturered consequences mean nothing if the child does not understand the intent behind them.", "Instead of telling him it\u2019s a bad word, have you tried telling him it\u2019s a word for grownups. What Huckleberry said is basically exactly what I did with my daughter. You can\u2019t guard them from words. Even I occasionally slipped an s word. I just told her that like driving, there are other things that adults do, and some words are just for adults too. I know every kid is different, but it was very effective with her and my friends\u2019 kids.\n\nThe first time I saw/heard my daughter curse, she was 16 and playing in the State Cup finals (soccer). She had an opening but sent the ball slightly too far to the right, and said, \u201cSHIT!\u201d Like a pro.", "You need to tell him *why*. You need to treat him as a person who wants to learn. \n\nYou also need to learn that the best way to get a seven year old to do something is to forbid them from doing it. The bigger of a reaction he gets from you, the more he wants to do it.", "Because kids are naturally curious. All they know is that this word illicits a response from you, they have no idea why and what it means but it makes mommy mad and daddy laugh. To a child, all attention is good attention. Which is also why not reacting any particular way when these words slip out is also a great tactic, because then it's just a word and they're not hyperfixated on why everyone is so distracted by it.\n\nRemoving the curiosity around a word can also take the power of said word away. Honestly it would probably still be funnier to a 7 year old boy to say poop or poopy over $hit.", "The problem is that you\u2019re working on the basis of *authority* rather than *explanation*. To you, it\u2019s enough that you, one of his primary authority figures told him to do something and hence he should obey - while this can work, it unfortunately does not create an environment in which intelligent, enquiring children have the space to develop. \n\nTo him, no one will explain why the word is \u201cbad\u201d. No one has explained to him why a word being \u201cbad\u201d means he shouldn\u2019t use it. \n\nAdditionally, you said he\u2019s only 5. Cognitively, he\u2019s too young to make the connection \u201cI\u2019m being punished for using a bad word after being told not to by my parents\u201d. To him, there is no connection. He says a new word sometimes. Also, for some reason his parents are mad at him and being mean. \n\nInstead, try removing the mystique of the word, or set criteria for use that he doesn\u2019t have. \u201cActually you have to be 25 to say that word because it\u2019s for grown ups only\u201d worked in our family", "It's not a bad word though. It's a word that's not socially acceptable. Bit different.", "Because you told him he doesn\u2019t need to know what it means and that\u2019s why the curiosity is still going. OP this is the time when you develop that trust where they\u2019ll either go to you in the future when they\u2019re curious about what something means or the look on the Internet and get all sorts of fucked up information, think very hard about which outcome would result in a more well-adjusted adult good luck", "It\u2019s not, all these ytas have a strange idea that parenting means letting the kids run wild. Your child is 7, if you tell him it\u2019s a bad word and he shouldn\u2019t use it, that should be the end of it. I think your punishment was acceptable. And guess what, he learned something by staying home.

You don't need to explain the meaning, it's not even used for its meaning anyway. You need to explain it's a very rude curse word, that is very offensive to a lot of people. Adults sometimes use it, to express anger or frustration but it's extremely rude and he mustn't use it. \n\nAs the parent of a 7 year old, you must realise parenting by simply demanding they do what you say without any explanation not only is an ineffective parenting strategy but is setting your child up for failure because you're not giving them the knowledge and tools to make their own decisions as they navigate the world. He's saying it over and over because you're frustrating him.", "I told my 7 year old that it has a few meanings, but usually it's a very rude way to refer to sex. Because I teach my kids about sex when they ask where babies come from. Not graphically, but just explaining that a mom has a vagina and a dad has a penis and when they come together, babies get made. It's not that hard. \n\nThen you say that in general, it's not polite to shout out swear words in public, especially around other people with children, and that you don't want to hear swearing in the house. THEN if he starts cussing up a storm, leaving him home is a great idea.", "I knew about human reproduction when I was 3 years old. My parents explained to me everything. When I was 7 I knew contraception existed.\n\nAlso you said you just listened to your parents when they told you not to say a bad word. I get it that you want your child to listen to you. I really do. But obedience is not necessarily good. In a child or in an adult. You want them to think for themselves, not being controlled by someone else. Being though to blindly follow authority opens the door to abusive relationships in adulthood. \n\nIf your child hasn't received a sufficient explanation of why the word is bad it's normal that they would want to use it, especially if they are getting an interesting reaction from you.", "It\u2019s actually a word that can be used in a lot of ways but only by grown ups.", "Oh I get that, but every kid is different, what worked for you may not work for him, sounds like he's curious.  My kids swore like a sailor around me when they were 7-8 years old, I didn't come down on them using the word just explained that some people don't like to hear it and you don't know who that is, so try not to use it in public.", "Were your parents right about everything?\n\nInstead of just forbidding these words, teach your son where and when it\u2019s appropriate to use \u201cbad words\u201d (alone, or in private among his little friends) and when it is not ok (out in public, or near adults). \n\nDiscipline includes teaching.", "And look how you turned out... \ud83d\udc80", "Unless you explain why it\u2019s a bad word a kids going to say it still.", "I think usually when a parent says no the child gets more curious and wants know about it. it\u2019s human nature I think to know be more curious about things that are forbidden. \n\nRather than saying it\u2019s a bad word explain it a child friendly way why it\u2019s bad and treating him like a human with his own personality and thought process.", "You claim in a different comment it never happened to you.", "When are you planning to discuss sex? Is that also a forbidden topic in your home?", "The difference is being told he doesn't need to know what it means and being told what it means in a child friendly way. You are his parents, it's your job to teach him.\n\nRight now all you are teaching him is he will get in trouble for asking questions you don't want to answer. He will stop asking you questions but he will ask someone and probably get misinformation.", "But he is not you he is building his own brain that needs its own nurturing and learning process. He\u2019s curious about a word. You believe it\u2019s a word only grown ups should use. Explain that to him. Kids are smart sometimes we forget to speak to them and we just demand they blindly obey without actual reason.", "How many times are you going to repeat that?  Sounds like your kid is more like you than you think.", "That\u2019s what you think. It might not be what your parents think or what really happened. \n\nKids don\u2019t learn by punishment. Only by example and by seeing what is right. You punished him for being curious and a typical 7 year old. \n\nYta. My mom organized a cursing quarter every time I learned a new word. 15 minutes in which i was allowed to use every word I knew. 15 minutes with fu*-the-f*-puckie-the-d* do bore out.

Your main argument in favor of this strategy is that it \u201cwas enough\u201d for you when you were a kid. You came to this sun and asked. You\u2019ve gotten the answer several times. I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s the answer (does seeing your reaction to hearing the same answer over and over help you realize where your son gets it from, and the desperation he may be feeling in the face of just \u201cnot getting it\u201d?)\n\nYour just being stubborn at this point. This whole story is a great example of how your stubbornness in the face of your son\u2019s persistent curiosity prolonged something that could have been handled pretty quickly. \n\nYour son isn\u2019t you and may require different parenting strategies than you did. Consider trying to be more flexible than just trying the same thing over and over again.", "Seriously, would suggest if it happens again, just deadeye him, look bored, and then say, \"you finished?\" \n\nNo reaction is sometimes the best reaction when a kid is trying to get one.", "That\u2019s only because you have lots of stress to relieve.", "I actually told mine around that age, successfully, that while I didn't really understand it either, most people did not like those words and they especially do not like those words from kids. Therefore they are not allowed to use them. And that they would get in very big trouble if they said them in public, at school or around Grandma. Then we had a conversation about mean words, and how they matter a lot more than bad words.", "I really don't get the obsession with \"bad words\". It's a word. I use it a lot. Not a bad person. \n\nIn my language, we have a very often used swear word. Of course kids hear it all the time. Parents tell them that it's an adult word and to say something else instead. You could compare it to saying fork instead of fuck. \n\nWhy are kids not allowed to use words to express certain emotions? As a psychologist I can guarantee it's a healthy and needed stress coping mechanism and much better than just swallowing whatever upset you. There's some funny studies about how swearing can help deal with pain (e.g. you stub your toe or step on a fucking Lego), it can reduce anger (car drivers who swear are less likely to engage in other road rage behaviour because they already got their anger out of the system) and so on.\n\nGive kids explanations and alternatives, don't just tell them to not say it. How is a child supposed to understand it?", "When I was younger, and my kids were young, I would think because I\u2019m the parent I said so. Don\u2019t get me wrong my kids knew the look.

She was 8, my daughter said, it\u2019s a word you don\u2019t say. My grand daughter kept saying it. I sat down with her and asked her where did you hear it. She had heard it at school. I told her . It is a grown up word, that is used as an insult. That she shouldn\u2019t be saying. I didn\u2019t react.  I told her she was going to hear lots of words of words and she could always come to me to talk about them.   There were other words. She asked about. I didn\u2019t go into full detail about the word. But did say some of these are adult words. She stopped saying the word.", "That's WHY he kept saying it.", "He's SEVEN!! perhaps he's saying it because it gets your attention? Try to deflect. Go play a game with him. Take him for a walk.  I guarantee if you ignore it a bit and work to get him interested in something else, it will work. You're the parent. Act like it.", "In fact, the word discipline comes from disciple, which means student. Discipline is completely about teaching. Punishment is a very poor teacher, and one that is far too often overused in place of putting real effort into educating children.", "You're extrapolating this one instance into ALL INSTANCES of him asking about things. \n\nMy parents would tell me, \"it's a bad word, don't say it until you're an adult\" and I was like \"Ok\"\n\nI never needed an explanation, and how would explaining it do anything? He can't use the word anyway.", "Kid is doomed", "While I don't agree with how OP handled this (I'm more into conversing with my child, explaining, giving all info and then giving healthy boundaries with this new info).\n\nIf I asked my kid to stop something, and they didn't, I would enact concequences. \n\nAgain-\nOP should've been more forthcoming and less dismissing. I mean fuck.. he could've even just told the kid he misheard and the movie said muck, truck, tuck, huck- etc. And it would've been better but I also I get the desire to squish and move on. First time my kid heard the word and said it, I fumbled because I found that word coming from her to be shocking ans bothersome as despite my sailor mouth- I've never swore in front of her or with her in the home.", "You asked for opinions and are complaining that I gave mine. Times have changed and you are not the same person as your son. Just because you didn't need an explanation does not mean he doesn't.
