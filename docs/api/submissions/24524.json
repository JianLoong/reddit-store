TWO.   Let him like what he likes.  \n\nYou can't \"make\" someone gay.  You are or you aren't.  And....he is TWO.  He doesn't understand gender or sexuality to a degree that he could even know yet if he his or isn't.\n\nAnd if he is?  So what?  I'd rather have a gay toddler than a homophobic parent any day.", "NTA.  But if you have family in the gay community,  how can they NOT know you can't MAKE a kid gay or straight?", "Oh FFS! NTA\n\nThere are no \"boy toys\" or \"girl toys\" - they're just toys. Any child can play with them. \n\nMy son loved his play kitchen. He would dress up as princesses and Tinker Bell. He is 17 now and he is not gay.", "NTA and your parents aren't willing to confront their still very present homo/transphobias. \n\nKids know who they are pretty well. We dressed our daughter in my nephew's hand me downs and let her play with whatever toys she liked as a toddler and... By the time she was four her favorite color was pink and she'd only wear dresses. She still doesn't like dolls but she loves unicorns and insists on having super long hair. Kids figure out gender and their sense of identity and sexuality pretty well on their own if they aren't crushed into a mold, and if they aren't shamed for it they'll be however they really are. Your kiddo will be whoever they are but they're two for heck's sake. Let them be two", "First off you can\u2019t \u201cmake\u201d someone gay. He has chosen what he likes and how he wants to express himself. You are doing the right thing by supporting him and not shaming him or trying to change him. Doing what your parents are saying is what causes kids who are a part of the LGBTQIA community to develop depression and feelings of isolation. It can cause mental health issues down the line.  \n\nLet him be himself and continue to choose what he wants to do. He may change on his own or he may not. Doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is your love and support. \n\nNTA.", "People are weird about sexuality.  A while ago I bought my cat a new collar that had an extra bell and silver reflective stripes on it.  My housekeeper said he wouldn't wear something like that because it's gay.  I fired her for that.", "NTA. Like you said, you're letting him choose! I'd say you'd be TA if you didn't let him play with the toys he likes. \n\nLet him be the queen that he deserves to be and if he wants to be a king or neither later then that's all fine too! \n\nI honestly don't know why people get so worked up over this shit. Just let people be who they wanna be - you sound like a great guardian :) and certainly not forcing anything", "NTA. You are being led by him and his wims. Sometimes it's a faze. Sometimes it isn't. Everything you are doing for him is directed by him. As far as I can tell you aren't pushing anything on him. You're not asking him if he likes boys or girls. You aren't asking him if he feels like a boy or a girl, you are taking his lead.\n\nAlso I don't know his background, but keep in mind trauma can affect gender expression. Make sure he spends some time with your dad and some other males you trust who be good role models. You are meeting him where he is and loving him for who he is. Good mom! \n\nIncidentally, I personally feel we are too hung up on labels. Want to be a straight male and into make up? No problem. Want to be a boy with a vagina? Also no problem. When people feel pigeonholed into gender norms, then that can lead to depression. (This is my opinion and I know everyone's experiences are different)", "NTA. There is no data to suggest that you can \u2018make someone gay\u2019. The kid likes what they like. If he\u2019s gay, growing up with homophobic grandparents would be hell. But liking dolls doesn\u2019t magically dictate your sexual preferences. \n\nGod it would be so easy if was easy to switch tho aye?", "He\u2019s a toddler, he can\u2019t be gay, straight, or anything in between yet. He\u2019s too young to have any sort of sexuality going on and it\u2019s weird that people are projecting sexuality onto him over outdated and grossly reductive gender norms like \u201cpink=girl and blue=boy\u201d", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you're reacting to what he says he wants.  All your parents are doing is perpetuating gender stereotypes.  It's as ridiculous as if he'd only eat vegetables and them accusing you of trying to make him a vegetarian.\n\nBeing someone who listens to what a child wants is preferable to deciding what they should want and forcing it on them.  \n\nMaybe the world would be a better place if more boys had been allowed to be princesses when they were young.", "Absolutely not. Let the kid be a kid. Hell I'd buy him a castle, some barbies, and more minnie mouse stuff. \u2661", "None of these behaviours have anything to do with being gay. Being a gay man is about liking other men, nothing to do with socially constructed gender roles. \n\nNTA but don\u2019t worry about if it means he\u2019s gay. Reverse the genders - everyone would think a little girl who likes trucks, the colour blue and ninja turtles more to be a normal \u201ctomboy\u201d. They wouldn\u2019t usually start saying oh she\u2019s lesbian.", "NTA, these are the same freaks who give their babies \u201clady killer\u201d onesies and \u201cmy dad is jealous I got b**bs for breakfast and he didn\u2019t\u201d bibs. Whose projecting onto who now.", "NTA\n\nYour son might be gay or trans; he might just be going through a phase. The thing that could scar him is overreacting to this so tell your parents to calm down", "Huge NTA my little nephew used to call himself princess and wear tiaras and dresses and carry around little sparkly wands. Kids go through phases sometimes and you're a good parent for supporting his interests", " NTA", "NTA. As a gay person I can honestly tell you there should be more parents like you. The only thing your guilty of is loving your son", "NTA\n\nHe's 2-3 and he's deciding what toys he likes and wants, that's not pushing gay, that's just letting him be independent. \n\nHell, next year he may decide he's done with most of that stuff and want the latest 'boys' toys!", "NTA there are no gay toys", "NTA. My son is 5, his favorite color is rainbow. He asks for his nails to be painted when I'm painting his sisters. Just let kids be kids. You are not \"making him gay\" did anyone make you bi?", "jeez, being gay isnt about liking pink and playing with dolls but about wanting to duck men. your parents are clowns. nta.", "NTA! \n\n*Fellas, is it gay to learn to cook?*", "You know who else likes to play kitchen? Gordon Ramsey. NTA", "I'm all male but I did love my sisters baking oven as a kid LOL", "There is no such thing as boys things or girl things.  Can we stop with that bs?", "NTA, gay dude here.  I hated \"girls\" toys as a kid.  I was your typical rough and tumble boy.  I had cars, model airplanes, walkie talkies, balls, etc.  Blue was my favorite color.  I was the most stereotypical boy in existence.  I still turned out to be gay.\n\nAnyone who genders toys is an AH.  Kids should be allowed to play with whatever they like to play with.  If he likes dolls and cooking and princesses, who the fuck cares.  Your parents are being very weird about this.", "NTA.\n\nToys don\u2019t make someone gay or straight. Neither do clothes, anymore than putting a costume on let\u2019s my toddler have ice or spiderweb powers. \n\nKids like what they like. You\u2019re just nurturing his interests and respecting what he wants to be called. (Same as if his name was John and he hated being called Johnny). \n\nI hope your little queen keeps slaying!", "NTA  You are a good mother. I wonder if this is less about \"gay\" and more about \"Trans\". \n\nUnfortunately, even in the LGB community there is a lot of people who are anti trans and what your parents really fear is him being transgender", "NTA and it\u2019s not particularly supportive of the LGBTQ community to be saying that kids need to conform to gender stereotypes based on the sex they were assigned at birth.", "NTA\nYou can\u2019t make someone gay, and choosing more typically feminine things definitely doesn\u2019t make you gay. That is a stereotype, the only thing that makes you gay is being attracted to the same sex\u2026. \n\nand he is freaking 2! \n\nLet him choose what he likes.", "Stop listening to your parents. Sorry it\u2019s mild homophobia.", "NTA.\n\nThey're toys and colors. They don't have any prescribed gender in them. The kid is 2. He doesn't even know what gender is. Relax.", "Poor kid is in for a testicle removal surgery in a couple years", "You most likely are confusing him, yes. He probably wouldn't be this way if he lived with straight parents, a mom and a dad. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, just making sure you're aware of how powerful \u201cnurture\" can be and of the effect influences at home can have. This is what he's exposed to - he has no masculine influences for 90% of his life. It would be an absolute shock if he didn't turn out feminine or whatever you want to call it.", "Info: how tf is half your family gay?", "Yeah, you're an asshole.
