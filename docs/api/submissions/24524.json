We dressed our daughter in my nephew's hand me downs and let her play with whatever toys she liked as a toddler and... By the time she was four her favorite color was pink and she'd only wear dresses. She still doesn't like dolls but she loves unicorns and insists on having super long hair. Kids figure out gender and their sense of identity and sexuality pretty well on their own if they aren't crushed into a mold, and if they aren't shamed for it they'll be however they really are.

He has chosen what he likes and how he wants to express himself. You are doing the right thing by supporting him and not shaming him or trying to change him.

It can cause mental health issues down the line.  \n\nLet him be himself and continue to choose what he wants to do. He may change on his own or he may not. Doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is your love and support. \n\nNTA.", "People are weird about sexuality.  A while ago I bought my cat a new collar that had an extra bell and silver reflective stripes on it.

You aren't asking him if he feels like a boy or a girl, you are taking his lead.\n\nAlso I don't know his background, but keep in mind trauma can affect gender expression. Make sure he spends some time with your dad and some other males you trust who be good role models. You are meeting him where he is and loving him for who he is. Good mom! \n\nIncidentally, I personally feel we are too hung up on labels. Want to be a straight male and into make up? No problem. Want to be a boy with a vagina? Also no problem.

The notion that a child's biological attractions can be influenced by playing with specific toys is ridiculous. If your toddler grows up to be gay the WORST you will have done is show him that you don't have a problem with that.\n\n3. They are overlooking the very real existence of several trans testimonies stating they knew from infancy. These toys in NO WAY make your toddler a girl but those feminine interests actually could be early indicators of a young trans girl trying to articulate \n\n4. Even if \"all\" that is at play is a little boy who doesn't absorb social conditioning at two and plays with what he wants... indulging that just teaches him that people should cherish the things they like and that its okay to make your own choices \n\n5. Toddlers remember words not context. If your toddler is part of the LGBTQ+ community, do they want his earliest memories of them to be scolding him for not being a \"normal boy\"?", "NTA. It's just exploration at that age. When I was a kid I was a huge tomboy. Always had short hair (bowl cut :( ), played with toy cars, action figures, watched wrestling, hated girly stuff, always played sports with the boys and wore boy clothes, wanted the be the strongest and the fastest, and get up to mischief. Blue was my favourite colour and I hated pink, and I used to say girls were stupid - I think this came from me being one of a handful of girls in a mostly boy class. Then I hit puberty and suddenly became very feminine and a bit boy crazy. Don't get me wrong, I still love sports, have lots of male friends and can be a bit competitive, but my preferences as a kid did not mean I became a lesbian/bi or trans.", "NTA.
