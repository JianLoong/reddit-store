{"id": 32520, "submission_id": "18ct5oe", "title": "AITA for laughing when I thought about moaning my boyfriends full first name?", "selftext": "My boyfriend and I were having a conversation about someone he met on a game recently, and when he told me the persons name we both laughed since it was a pretty weird name. I don\u2019t even remember it, it was Reginald or something similar. We joked that it\u2019d probably be one of the worst names to have when it comes to the bedroom. \n\nThen the thought popped into my head of my boyfriends full name. It\u2019s not a weird name by any means, it\u2019s actually super common. But because no one ever calls him by his full first name, I found it funny thinking about saying his name in bed. The thing is, I feel like basically every name sounds funny in that context if it\u2019s their FULL first name, not just their nickname. Am I the only person who feels like that? Like, Tom vs Thomas, John vs Johnathan. One name clearly sounds less stupid right?\n\nAnyway, I chuckled to myself and he asked what I was laughing at. I hesitated to tell him at first because I know he\u2019s pretty sensitive, but he kept asking so I just told him. He got super upset and i tried explaining that it\u2019s not just HIS name in particular, it\u2019s just any full name sounds stupid, including mine. I\u2019d probably burst out laughing during sex if he ever moaned my full first name. He got angry at that too because he asked why I was even thinking about moaning other guys names?? \n\nHe ended up getting even more upset and angry and said \u201cHow would you feel if I laughed at your body during sex?\u201d Surely this isn\u2019t even remotely comparable right? Or am I just being a jerk? Like, I get it when guys laugh at boobs or something because hey, boobs are funny. I honestly wouldn\u2019t mind that and I\u2019d probably join in, but the way he said it sounded as if he was trying to take a jab at my body, which he knows I\u2019m insecure about. I got kinda pissed off then but ended up backing down like I usually do. I\u2019ve honestly started to think about ending things because he tends to start arguments over any little thing I do and gives me the cold shoulder for days, and it\u2019s really starting to impact my mental health badly. \n\nWorst part is that when we \u201cmade up\u201d (he\u2019s still being cold with me) he made me promise to moan his full name next time we have sex! I said yes but honestly, I don\u2019t know if I could do it with a straight face. \n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1701946686, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ct5oe/aita_for_laughing_when_i_thought_about_moaning_my/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel that in this situation your boyfriend may have had an insecurity that you (and maybe he) didn\u2019t know about, as getting into an argument strong enough to shake your feelings in the relationship is unusual in the context of how names sound meaning this is something you should talk about as a couple. As you said that this isn\u2019t the first time a small thing has caused an argument like this I feel like you can your boyfriend should reconsider the relationship and what you want from each other.", "I think you both should call Reginald and ask his opinion.", "NTA\n\nThere was no malicious intent to it. Your guy's just no fun. Everyone should be able to laugh at themselves a little bit. He needs to get over his sensitivity.", "NTA\n\nALL names become funny if moaned\n\nMaybe not in the spicy moment itself, but if you think about it out of context I guarantee I'll be chuckling at all of them", "LOL I actually have a husband with a name like that and I\u2019ve called him by his nickname exclusively for a decade. In the last year or so I tried using his full name during sex because I know he\u2019s trying to transition to it now that we\u2019re a bit older and it felt so forced to me and I giggled as well. Also - he and his dad share the name but his dad uses the full name so that got to me as well \ud83d\ude02", "NTA - \"he made me promise to moan his full name next time we have sex\" yikes, the insecurity, the red flags, the complete lack of consent present in angrily demanding someone do something during sex; you're not just not the asshole, you might be in actual danger", "Yikes, he comes across as childish and a little pathetic if he can even understand the process of the mind entertaining a little thought/joke that isn't serious. NTA.", "NTA. But sexuality and sex is a potentially painful area for a lot of people, and one where the nakedness isn't just physical.

He needs to learn when to leave well enough alone. Him insisting you moan his full name during sex to make it up to him is a big red flag and will not go well no matter what happens.
