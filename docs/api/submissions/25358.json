You sound very judgmental about her lack of closeness to your mother, but given your age difference, you would not have witnessed much of what your sister endured to create the relationship they have.\n\nYou don't get to dictate someone else's milestone days selections any more than you get to dictate how someone grieves the loss of their parent.\n\nYou don't have to go to her wedding, that is fine.  But honestly, it is just a date, you are making it way bigger than it needs to be.  Do you really want to destroy whatever relationship you have with your sibling?", "YTA - honey you know NOTHING about what happened between your mom and her, you only know what your mom told you. You had a good relationship with her that is good for you, but you do not get to be the judge of your sister. You have some serious growing up to do! You have the right to attend or not attend the wedding, that really doesn\u2019t matter. But your projection of why she does what she does and how she feels is abhorrent. I am not surprised she doesn\u2019t try to be around you more. Maybe if you listened you would be better able to understand her. But if you are not willing to do that, then just leave her alone completely.", ">my mom passed away two years ago\n\n>I haven\u2019t had time to process the loss\n\n???\n\nYou weren\u2019t even *born* yet when your sister was 12.  How do you know what happened between your sister and your mom at that time?\n\nEveryone grieves differently.  For you, it means sitting on your grief for 2 years until you have the time to process her passing.  For your sister, it means getting married on her mom\u2019s birthday so that she feels more connected to her mother.\n\nYTA.  Don\u2019t attend if you don\u2019t want to.  But don\u2019t think that you get to decide why she does the things she does or that she is the evil sister trying to take a jab at your dead mother.  That date on the calendar isn\u2019t \u201cyour\u201d mom\u2019s birthday to be left alone - she was also your sister\u2019s mom.  She had a relationship with her too, entirely separate from you and whatever you think of the two of them.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t get to judge how she grew up as you were not there.  You two were 16 years apart.  Parents change after their first child.  You most likely had an entirely different upbringing than your sister.  You need to talk to a therapist about processing your grief.", "YTA. My mom was a wonderful mom to me and a terrible mom to my brother who is 11 years older than me. Those are both true at the same time. It can happen. You don't get to choose how your sisters remembers your mom because y'all were basically raised by 2 different people. I was a lot different 12 years ago too and if I could have a do over on raising my kids there is a lot I would change.", "To be honest, YTA. My relationship with my mother was complex and difficult at times. I still know that she wanted desperately to be able to attend my wedding but died of cancer ten years before she could. I'm having the wedding on her birthday as a way to both have her there in spirit and hold her day as special within my new family, even though they never got to meet her. I understand exactly where your sister is coming from, and I'm lucky that my little brother gets where I'm coming from.", "YTA - honestly there is not enough info to go on but you are basically trying to define your sisters relationship with her dead mom. \n\nYou were not alive for the entirety of the time she was raised. You really can\u2019t speak as an authority on her relationship.", "Sorry, but I think YTA.  You don't get to decide how your siblings honor or grieve your late mother.    \n\n\nI am sorry that you are still grieving this badly.  I hope you are able to find some peace.", "NAH.  Sister said she wants to honor your mom. Even if she goes through with it, it\u2019s not like she expects everyone to celebrate her wedding anniversary every year, only her husband. \n\nSo, this is not going to detract from the memory of your mom, going forward. With that said, I understand that you have a lot of negative feelings about your sister and how she treated your mom.", "You don't get to dictate the date of her wedding.  You don't get to try to influence her by threatening not to attend.\n\nYou can however decline to attend.\n\nYTA", "YTA \nYou are way too young to really know what the relationship dynamic was for your mother and sister in her childhood. You don't get to decide whether it's valid or not for her to have felt abandoned at 12. You don't get to decide her wedding date. You don't have to go, but you also shouldn't act like you are entitled to a specific date.", "NAH. She told you to be 100% honest.", "NAH", "NAH. Your sister asked you for your honest opinion, and you gave it to her. If she decides to go through with her wedding on that date, then that would be a pretty AH move.", "NAH. You don't actually know what happened between your sister and your mom. You have one side of the story. Stop making your mom a saint and your sister the villain. Process your grief and realize that your mom didn't belong to just you.", "NTA Sister asked for your opinion and you gave it.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe your sister really does mean it is honoring your mother. but it still seems crass in the light of how she treated her.\n\nIf you boycott the wedding, people will ask and you will answer and your sister knows that won't be good for her. So maybe that in itself will cause her to change the date.", "I mean, I don't agree with you, but I don't think YTA when she specifically sought your opinion out, presumably because she knew it could be controversial", "NAH", "NAH", "NAH. You have differing views about choosing your mother\u2019s birthday for her wedding. If she feels that she is honoring her mother, that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s also OK if you decide not to attend the wedding, but it won\u2019t be OK if you make a big stink about it. She asked your opinion and you gave it to her, what she does now is up to her. BTW, your sister was 16 when you were born, I have to wonder how you know that your mother never abandoned her when she was 12 or what their relationship was like at all? You only have your mother side of the story and you seem bound and determined to ignore your sister\u2019s side of the story. It seems unfair to dismiss your sister\u2019s feelings about her relationship with your mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Listen do I agree with you that people shouldn't plan their wedding day on a close family member's birthday? Yeah I do. It's weird and definitely not a sign of respect. My grandmother whose birthday was the day before mine passed last year before Thanksgiving. My Dad got remarried this year on his dead mother's birthday, the day before mine and I will tell you there was no part of it that felt honoring to me, especially as the person my grandmother celebrated with every year. It just felt disgraceful, and even my father has come to regret his choice to get married that on that day because he's come to realize his mother's birthday and his daughter's birthday will be forevermore overshadowed by his wedding anniversary. But my personal feelings aside, it's your sister's wedding and you don't have to agree with it or go, but if she wants to do it because despite her bad relationship with mom she feels this is honoring her, she's allowed to do it.", "YTA it\u2019s her mother too she can honour her how she likes maybe you\u2019d have a better relationship with your siblings if you lose the main character complex", "NTA.

She has every right to feel the way she does about her mother abandoning her.", "The way you are wording this makes me think your mother had an affair with your father? It would make sense for your sister to feel abandoned if your mother cheated on her dad, causing the divorce.", "Your sister would have been an adult before you even reached the age of 6! You can\u2019t possibly know what happened between her and your mom\u2026.unless you are listening to only 1 side of the story!", "That is abandonment.  Your mom chose a man over her child.  At 12 kids don\u2019t get to choose where they live.  Your mom most likely had to concede her right to visitation.  No caring parent would ever do that to a 12 year old.  A good parent realizes a 12 year old has valid feelings and tries to work through them, not hand them over to the other parent.", "This is exactly abandonment. Who the hell are you to say what her experiences were when you weren\u2019t even born? Obviously you only heard one side of the story (your mom\u2019s).

And she moved out to be with someone else?  Even if your mother saw it as making the best choice for everyone involved, it's perfectly normal for a 12 year old to feel hurt and abandoned by that.", "My mom gets \"hurt\" too, whenever she is confronted with the shit she has done to my brothers and me. And she sings the same song your mom did to anyone she can manipulate.\n\nI don't know your mother. Maybe she changed her ways, or maybe she had you so wrapped around her finger that you automatically take her side.

She was an adult by the time you were of age to remember anything.  Just because your mother was a great mother to you does not mean she was a good one to your sister.  You do not get to decide if what your sister says happened is rumors or lies given the fact that all you have to refute it is your mom's word", "Narcissists are always \"hurt\" when they are exposed.", "Did you read the comment she offered  for her to stay there she refused I swear some people on here pretend to read things and just say whatever they are feeling like wtf", "This is just all wrong? Like almost impressively bad take on what she just said", "My mother is the same way. If I dared to disagree about something or refused her \"help\" (which I never even asked for it the first place) she played the victim card instantly. Same thing if I dared bring up the shit she put me through during my childhood.  \nThere' s a reason I went NC with her as soon as I moved out.\n\nI'm betting the sister was indeed abandoned by their mother like she said, and the mother spun a different story that the OP swallowed hook, line, and sinker."]}
