Its a basic data entry job with some customer service related stuff.\n\nI prepped for the interview, probably more than I should have because it was where my mom was employed, therefore I wanted to make a really good impression.\n\nIt was with her manager, and a team lead. My mom had some really nice things to say about her manager, saying she was really nice, and how amazing it is to work with her, not so much the team lead, who she said is a bit of a douche bag.\n\nIt was through zoom, and I joined the call about 30 mins early.\n\nTo start, both of them joined 30 mins after the time they said the interview would start, for which they did apologize for.\n\nNo pleasentries or small talk at all, they just asked me the first question related to the role off the bat, and 30 seconds in to speaking, my mom's manager looks at her phone and starts clicking away on it. Only the team lead was paying attention to me now and it threw me off, but I kept talking, by the third question I asked if everything was okay and she looked up for a split second and the team lead told me not to focus on that and focus on the task at hand. For the third question I wasnt even finished speaking before he cut me off.\n\nThen he asked me to pretend like we were simulating a call where he would be the client and I would be the employee, I knew as soon as we started conversing that he was making this into some pathetic joke for himself when he pretended to be some absolute dumbass decrepit old man who didnt know how computers worked at all, asking me questions that were basically trying to set me up to fail, even though the people they are dealing with are competent corporate workers using the companies web application.\n\nI said word for word \"you know what guys, obviously I caught you at a bad time, YOU cant even give me the time to look away from your phone, and YOU obviously know that I would never deal with a client like this. Im just going to hang up. This was by far the most pathetic interview Ive ever been in and I hope next time you guys dont want to take an interview from a referral you should just say so.\"\n\nI dont think ive ever gotten that angry before during an interview\n\nI record all my interviews just for myself to learn from and review. When my mom asked me how it went I showed her, and I thought she'd take my side but she got angry saying that this is her place of work and I shouldnt have spoken to her boss that way, regardless of how bad the interview was I need to \"let go of my ego and emotions\" and suck it up.\n\nWTF. I swear I feel like that my response was warranted, but then again she is right. She has to work there and I maybe I did fuck up her relationship with her boss.

As much as the interview might have not been ideal for you, you absolutely need to be professional at all times. You 100% let your ego and emotions take over. \n\nWorking world 101 - never burn a bridge. \n\nIt does sound unprofessional of the person being on their phone, but you have to focus and strive past that. You\u2019re going to face A LOT of things you don\u2019t like in a job in the future. Mostly people being idiots or not working well with others, etc. the list could go on\u2026 but, that\u2019s life. You will work with so many people you don\u2019t like, be in situations you don\u2019t want to be in, have to deal with unexpected events, and you need to suck it up, to be blunt. \n\nIn this situation, your mum vouched for you and helped set up an interview. You have made her look bad and being rude on the call (regardless of the interviewer being rude) you have potentially strained that working relationship between your mum and them. \n\nTreat this as a learning curve.", "YTA. Not only for fucking up your mom's position at work (which is a damn big YTA) but also for blowing up the interview. You say it's \"tough as shit\" and guess what, you're doing it to yourself. If you just played along, you might have gotten the job, or at least, not fucked over your mom. Arrogance will not serve you. It did not help you here and it hurt your mom. You have a lot of growing up to do.", "YTA. When someone gets you an interview you have certain obligations that are above and beyond what a standard interview would require.\n\nAre are correct in the fact your interviewers totally disregarded your time and we're giving strong this is a bad place to work environment. Even in an interview you got on your own the way you ended it would have been unprofessional. \n\nIf you wanted to end the interview right then and there you should have interrupted your answer and said I'm sorry, my blocked time for this interview has expired and I'm going to need to go. I am going to go ahead and withdraw my application at this time, I don't think this is a good fit.\n\nAs to your tantrum on the call, oh dear sweet summer child, you have no idea how many young, smart employees have no idea how to use the computer or company software. There is a reason the very first thing IT asks you any time you call for help is \"is it plugged in and turned on\". The questions they were asking you were not outside the norm.\n\nYou screwed up big time.", ">pretended to be some absolute dumbass decrepit old man who didnt know   \nhow computers worked at all, asking me questions that were basically   \ntrying to set me up to fail, even though the people they are dealing   \nwith are competent corporate workers using the companies web application\n\nA million IT support workers just laughed and don't know why.\n\nI feel mean making fun of you because job hunting can completely wreck your mental health and emotional responses after a while. It can feel, and in fact, be so dehumanising and cause you to lash out. Which you did. You need to apologise to your mother and, if possible, to the interviewers.  To Mum because she stuck her neck out and to the interviewers because that's no the last impression you want to leave with anyone who might have cause to discuss you in professional circumstances.", "YTA. Your mom used up a *lot* of social capital to get you an interview, and you not only threw it all away, you brought her ability and her judgement into question.\n\nI get you're frustrated. Job searching sucks. But people like you? With little industry experience, having just graduated? I'm sorry, but from an employment point of view you're a dime a dozen. You built it all up in your head, you got way too involved, and then your feelings were hurt when they weren't invested in you. \n\nLearn to read the context. They were 30 minutes late, but they still met with you instead of cancelling altogether. That was a good thing. But clearly something was going on (late + needing to be on the phone = unresolved issue they've interrupted for you). Instead of being grateful, you came off as childish and unprofessional.\n\nFor next time, you can wait for a while, maybe 20 minutes, then email, *politely*, saying that you understand something has come up and asking to reschedule.", "YTA - And with some serious main character syndrome as well.\n\nThere's a lot you might have to learn about life and basic interactions.\n\nI hope that you didn't negatively affect your mums position.", "YTA\n1. From your description the response was not warranted at all. You don\u2019t say these things to interviewers period. With the current job market can you really afford to burn bridges like these. I can say this as a new grad myself who got a job after one entire year of searching.\n\n2. You NEVER talk back in an interview a loved one got you. You may have permanently damaged your mom\u2019s reputation at the job and for what \u2018the interviewer was looking at their phone and another interviewer gave you an outlandish scenario\u2019. This is beyond unprofessional and egotistical of you.\n\nApologize to your mom and if your mom agrees to the boss. Learn from this experience", "YTA and you need to accept that you are not special at all. \n\nProbably a group of busy people doing a favour for a colleague in a busy day and you\u2019ve come in like you are the top pick in a draft \n\nI mean if that was a test to see how you would do around the general public you failed spectacularly \n\nEntitlement is off the charts here", "YTA. Are you kidding?\n\nFirst, for thinking you're entitled to the undivided attention of everyone in the interview at all times. The manager was there, but the interview was obviously being conducted by the team lead. You don't know what the manager was doing, so you're frankly an idiot and an AH to take offense to it.\n\nSecond, on the simulated call, they were testing you, and you failed spectacularly. 100% the stupid questions he asked were questions you can expect in customer service. Yes, really. So you're an idiot again, and an AH for cutting off the interview.\n\nThird, the rude way you cut off the interview was appalling considering your *mom* works there. Did it occur to you for one second that you just jeopardized her position in the office? Did it occur to you for one second that you may not know WTF you're talking about?\n\nYTA YTA YTA.\n\nAnyone saying you're NTA clearly didn't read your post carefully enough, or has never had to interview for a job.", "YTA \"competent corporate workers\" lmfao - there are a lott of boomers working corporate jobs (in high positions at that) that are a disaster with anything IT related so that is a completely valid and common scenario. Can't even count how many anecdotes I've heard of C level personal being unable to use mail clients, presentation software etc without handholding. And it's quite normal for team leads to lead tech portions of the interview, the manager doesn't need to pay attention to it so much, they have other agenda. You are young, so hopefully you'll learn the world doesn't revolve around you some day. When you're a senior employee and u've done interviews yourself you can have an ego and think(and you might even be right) you know better than interviewers,for now be professional and gratefull for the opportunity when you get it.", "YTA. Kid, job interviews are an opportunity for you, not for the interviewer. If you keep flushing down opportunities to placate your fragile ego, then you will end up with nothing. You should have learned this by 22 but here you are. Your mom is right. You are an entree-level person. Get back to ground and pay your dues before developing an ego.", "Dude, YTA. Yeah it sucks that your mom's boss was being an ass during the interview, but you coulda handled it differently than just storming out and dissin' their whole organization like that. You gotta chill with the ego, nobody likes an arrogant prick in a job interview. But hey at least now you know not to work there if they're gonna treat potential employees like shit show monkeys on Zoom calls all day long \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "ESH. I work in academia, and am currently job searching while also conducting a job search at my university. \n\n1. Interview questions are usually developed based on things that really happen on the job. It\u2019s incredibly naive to think that, while working in customer service, you will not get calls from people who seem to have no common sense. That will likely be the majority of what you deal with.\n\n2. Your mom referred you for the job. You played high-and-mighty as a 22yr old new grad, when they have something you want: a job. They probably have dozens of applicants, and ask the same questions in every interview. In that dynamic, it\u2019s your job to impress them. Not the other way around. You 100% made her look bad.\n\n3. It is a bit weird that they were 30 minutes late with no notification, and that one person was on their phone the entire time. If they truly were in the middle of something, they could have reached out to let you know they were running behind or rescheduled you. But you also could have emailed them after waiting 10 minutes past the start time to check in and ask to reschedule. Things happen. You also could have asked your mom afterwards if this is normal, she may have been able to give you some insight as to why the interview went down like that.\n\n4. Even if they were purely being unprofessional, you were too. I\u2019ve sat in interviews where I was asked 2 questions, the interviewers barely spoke, and then when they asked me \u201cdo you have any questions for us,\u201d and I asked them a couple, they barely responded or gave non-answers. Did I call them out and get frustrated? No. I stayed professional and polite, and then as soon as the call ended I thought, \u201cwow that was rough, probably not somewhere I want to work.\u201d I don\u2019t want to risk my reputation getting tanked because I treated the interviewers like I was better than them. People talk. You might not have just messed with your mom\u2019s reputation, but you may have also messed with your own if you try to apply to similar jobs.", "YTA. Your job search would probably be less of a fight if you stopped acting entitled like this. Guess what you have to deal with douchebags in customer service all the time. And you clearly couldn\u2019t handle it. Your mom got you this interview and you made the worst possible impression", "YTA because it was your mom\u2019s workplace and her professional reputation vouched for you, so you have hurt her reputation at work.\n\nUnfortunately, employers are going to be jerks. If you don\u2019t want to work there, that\u2019s fine - nobody on the call cares about your reasons, or will learn from your lecture. Withdrawal of your application says enough. \n\nPart of the reason people act up on the antiwork sub is because they have already spent years doing the garbage interviews you just had to learn skills in entry level positions. This is why they can accurately assess which opportunities are a turd with a bow on it. You have several years of entry level work to get to a point in your career where you can do that.", "YTA.  I'm not even sure why you're offended they weren't both paying attention to you.  Like, why are you entitled to that?  Your only concern there is giving the interview, and one person can take care of that.\n\nYou definitely want to get that temper under control.  If something like this is tilting you, you're going to end up kicking the shit out of someone once you have to start dealing with actual bullshit from coworkers.  That's not conducive to maintaining continued employment btw.", "ESH.\n\nBeing late and messing around on their phone was highly unprofessional.\n\nHowever, so were you. You are also woefully wrong about it being \"a pathetic joke for himself\" with doing an example of a call. It's very arrogant and a little bizarre of you to assume that he was doing that for his own amusement.\n\nThese scenarios are designed to see how you handle difficult customers, how you behave under pressure, whether you can stay professional in a frustrating situation. All of which are skills you would need in this job, and all of which you failed at in your response.\n\nYes, job-searching sucks. But you have a lot to learn if you think this was a smart or sensible move in an interview.", "Bloody hell of course YTA. You damaged your mother's reputation with her boss AND you've shown that you're too immature to deal with any little inconvenience or frustration in the workplace. Plus if you're looking to work in the same industry, you may have blown your chance with other companies because word'll get around.\n\n\nApologise to your mum and mend those bridges.", "I am so embarrassed for you right now.", "YTA.  I was looking from comments from you to see why you thought you were all that, but I don\u2019t see any.   You are looking for a job, you had an interview and you were an ass.   You have no idea what was going on with the manager and why she was on the phone, and frankly it was none of your business.   And FYI as customer service you have no idea what type of calls you will get. You were so rude. \n\nThis might explain why you are having a hard time finding a job.", "YTA. Your mother went out of her way to get you that interview and you behaved like a petulant child. She is absolutely right - your behaviour was shocking. There are ways you can politely end an interview if you believe that's the right thing to do - and that is not what you did here.\n\nYou need to wise up.", "YTA. Recent grad w this ego? Yikes", "YTA for a couple of reasons. First: You expected small talk and pleasantries for an interview? What? This is a job interview, not a hangout with the bros before some karaoke. \n\nSecond: the test scenario. If you think that there is a company on this planet where every worker is a competent person, and that you're never going to encounter an older person who doesn't understand technology very well within the company, then by all means share the name of this mythical company so we can all go work there because it sounds like a dream. I've worked at a big reputable company before. Some of the people I've had to help barely knew how to google \"Outlook\". \n\nThird: Managers are often on their phone. Doesn't necessarily mean they're not paying attention. They're usually busy with 7 things at the same time, whether it's talking to their colleagues, getting some details for a meeting later, planning company-mandated meetings or trainings, reviewing some new regulations they have to comply with, checking on progress, and so on. They are often listening and they will tune into the conversation when they need to. \n\nFourth: This was your mother's work. How do you think it will look if they know their colleague raised a rude, unprofessional son who loses his temper literally 30 minutes into an interview. In good companies, she'd get pity. In bad companies, she'd be the laughing stock for being a bad mother.\n\nFifth: This was what, 30 minutes? You couldn't control yourself for 30 minutes because of 1 hypothetical to test you? Really? \n\nI think you might want to go over your other recorded interviews with your mom to compare, because it sounds like you have a big, misplaced ego.", "YTA. Interviewers are also testing people\u2019s reactions and you failed big time, especially your mom. Good luck getting a job if you cannot contain your feelings in interviews. You potentially harmed your mom\u2019s career but apparently that doesn\u2019t matter because everything is just about you and nobody else matters.", "Even though they were rude to you, YTA for blowing up.\n\nYou can't control how others behave but you can control how you behave. In this case, this affects your family as well.\n\nYou have a lot of toughening up to do, young man.", "YTA \nPoor your mum.\nBtw for all you know, they were pushing you to see how you reacted.", "YTA. Have you ever worked customer service? So many people you'd assume would be capable with technology just aren't. And that's putting it politely.\n\nYou never know where you'll run into these people again, maybe at a company in future that you desperately want to work at. You need to keep things like that in mind.\n\nYour mom did you a big favour, it was probably really difficult for her to get you an interview.", "Woooooow you\u2019re a child and YTA. The scenario is not an add one and you have no concept of the different level of digital literacy in large scale corporations. You also have no idea of the possible emergency your mum boss (who she admires) was dealing with and they were not obligated to inform you. You shat on your mums work relationships because you were immature and emotional.", "YTA it could have well been that manager was meaning to hire you regardless as a nepotism hire (consider yourself lucky) and was only doing the interview for formalities. Now you will never know for blowing up in the interview.", "YTA. You have NO idea who was on the other side of the phone. Maybe it could not wait. Either way, not your problem. And it doesn't matter how competent you think your client will be(you are setting yourself up for failure overestimating corporate minded people). You have to be able to problem solve through the basics. Which you were unable to show because your pride and ego were in the way.\n\nAnd now, your own mother, who referred you, for her \"entry level job\" which you seem to show no respect for, is going to be looked at sideways and may not even HAVE a job in the near future. With your attitude, times will be rough for a long time.", "This is so funny you sound like some kids anime main character. You're the one getting interviewed, meaning you're the one in need for a job. So just focus on yourself to show how good of a candidate you are. Keep being polite and professional. Good luck for the next interview and I hope this won't affect your Mom's job.", "NTA. Does no one here ever go to the anti-work sub reddit? An interview goes both ways. You are there to see weather or not you want to be employed by them or not. How high is the turn over rate at that company? \n\nThey coming in 30 minutes late, then at least pretending to not pay attention and being on their phone or really doing so while at the same time cutting you off when asking questions they supposedly want OP's answer to....\n\nThey're testing how much bs OP is willing to put up with right of the bat. OP had every right to decide that if they can't be bothered with basic courtesy of being on time and actually pay attention to the interview and appearing to do so, means he doesn't want this job. He got a job on trades to get by in the mean time.\n\nHowever OP, don't underestimate how stupid people actively working with computers can actually be.... A few posts from tales from techsupport.....", "YTA! Jesus Christ you\u2019re unbelievably selfish. But I guess in a way your mom\u2019s TA for failing to raise you properly.", "No sympathy for an attitude such as yours.", "YTA - You thought the interview was going to be a walk in the park because of nepotism. when it started to get it a bit challenging you freaked out and rage quitted. In the real world you have to be able to handle a bunch of scenarios. You failed the tests and embaressed your mom. Get a reality check and learn to roll with punches. \n\nToo many assholes have egos and think they should be instant CEOs because they studied and have 100k debt. Doesn't work like that. Get on that ladder like everyone else.", "YTA and a raging one at that. And that after your mom set up the interview, the least you can do is keep calm and be professional.", "If you only knew how dumb people can be. Pilots have come into my airside clothing store and asked where the shoes are. While standing directly next to the sign that tells them. \nYou blew up, you didn\u2019t remain professional, you DID let your anger and ego get in the way because you felt disrespected by pretty normal interview stuff. \nIn customer service, they often test you- can you deal with rude customers and keep your cool. YTA", "YTA.\n\nIt wasn't like your mum was just vouching for a friend or ex colleague. That's bad enough on a professional level when tgey turn out ti be unsuitable and rude but you are her child so potentially she looks unprofessional AND like a shit parent who has raised an asshole. The fact she didn't agree with your actions and admonished you suggests she didn't raise you to be entitled like that. I'm a mum and I seriously go to bat for my girl when required but I would be mortified if she acted like this. Your poor mom", "I understand why you got upset, but you are an AH for how you handled things. This is your mom's place of work, remember? \n\nYou could have ended the interview by making up any excuse for you to leave (they were half an hour late anyway, so it wouldn't be that unbelievable you hadn't planned for it to go on as long as it did). There was no need for you to lash out in such an unprofessional way, even if they were unprofessional.\n\nI'll just go with ESH", "YTA. You behaved like a bratty child and your mother is probably really embarrassed", "ESH.\n\nI mean, who logs into a zoom interview 1/2-hour early???\n\nThem: For showing up late, her for being distracted.\n\nYou: For going off the rails - this is your Mom's place of work, after all.

If it weren't for that, I'd be cheering you on for de-normalising shitty mindgames at interviews. A polite \"This isn't gonna work out. Thanks for your time\" and hanging up would have been fine.", "YTA and your mom is right.  She put herself out there by recommending you for the job and your handling of the interview hurt her.  They were unprofessional but instead of your handling it in a professional way you stooped to their level.  You could have easily finished the interview and then, if offered the job, politely declined.", "YTA. Even if it wasnt a test and they were just dismissive and didnt care, you still need to remain professional, even when interviewers are not. On top of that, that was your mom's boss, you have any idea how much you fucked her over by talking back to her boss?", "Yta - enjoy a life of unemployment, I have done and delivered interviews like this and at time work demands you split your attention\nIf you can't cope with it then you will never have work\nThe second part of this is you have embarrassed and damaged your mother's career who recommended you ib the first place..\n\nYou may be 22 but you acted a child", "YTA. \n\nYour poor mother. Hopefully she doesn't lose her job over your extremely immature and unprofessional behavior. \n\nWhy would you ever feel entitled to do this in an interview referred by your own mother, who STILL WORKS THERE???????\n\nYou need to deal with your ego. You are not as important as you think you are.", "YTA. Your response may be valid, but that doesn't mean you should have said it out loud. If you didn't like the way they were treating you, you could have just waited it out and then not accepted the job. People are going to treat you like crap many, many times throughout your life. Especially bosses and higher ups. No, you don't have to take it. But if the person in question is your mom's boss, then you do need to be cordial because she stuck her neck out for you and you potentially destroyed her relationship with her boss. I know people of your generation feel like you shouldn't have to take crap from anyone and you need to \"set people straight\" if they are being disrespectful. Unfortunately interviews aren't the right place to do it if you really need a job.", "NTA, so crazy to me people are saying YTA here, I guess some people don\u2019t have standards. You did the right thing, they sounded awful. You\u2019ll find better, move on from it", "Id say NTA, why would you not put your foot down when they showed up late and then couldn\u2019t even be bothered to pay attention, but I think this is gonna be a generational thing. \nApplying for jobs, getting interviews, quitting, etc. all seem to be diving factors among generations and even just between the older vs the younger of generations.

Only the team lead was paying attention to me now and it threw me off, but I kept talking, by the third question I asked if everything was okay and she looked up for a split second and the team lead told me not to focus on that and focus on the task at hand.\n\nThen he asked me to pretend like we were simulating a call where he would be the client and I would be the employee, I knew as soon as we started conversing that he was making this into some pathetic joke for himself when he pretended to be some absolute dumbass decrepit old man who didnt know how computers worked at all even though the people they are dealing with are competent corporate workers using the companies web application.\n\nI said word for word \"you know what guys, obviously I caught you at a bad time, YOU cant even give me the time to look away from your phone, and YOU obviously know that I would never deal with a client like this. Im just going to hang up. This was by far the most pathetic interview Ive ever been in and I hope next time you guys dont want to take an interview from a referral you should just say so.\"\n\nI dont think ive ever gotten that angry before during an interview\n\nI record all my interviews just for myself to learn from and review. When my mom asked me how it went I showed her, and I thought she'd take my side but she got angry saying that this is her place of work and I shouldnt have spoken to her boss that way, regardless of how bad the interview was I need to \"let go of my ego and emotions\" and suck it up.\n\nWTF. I swear I feel like that my response was warranted, but then again she is right. She has to work there and I maybe I did fuck up her relationship with her boss.

What sucks, is that your mom will have to continue working there, and it will prolly really suck for her going forward. Never mind the office gossip about cocky so-and-so's son who acted out in an interview he wasn't completely qualified for either. See, this sorta shit you can pull with 5-10 year tenure on a particular role and if they treated you like crap you still dont use those words. \n\nYou politely end the interview by pretty much saying \"im not sure what is happening, but this interview isn't going the direction i hoped so id like to withdraw my application and end the interview at this point, am sorry that this hasn't gone better but i would rather not waste your time, thanks again for having a call with me, really appreciate the opportunity. Have a good day\"\n\nInterviews go bad all the time, you finish it, thank them for their time, and you refuse any further rounds if they offer those if you really didn't like how 1st round went.\n\nAll you did was act like a child. You are not special. They took time out of their day to interview you - the son. You should've just answered best to your ability and as all interviews go - they go both ways. Just like you are getting interviewed, you also observe whether this a manager you can work with. If you dont like your prospective manager or team lead, you simply dont drag out the interview. Because again, you are just 22, zero practical experience in the field - you aren't special. Even with 10+ years of experience i had interviews go catastrophically bad, either because im having a bad day, or someone else is. And frankly some i simply chose not to proceed with because i wasnt sure about the manager or team i would be joining. And yeah most interviews theres not always small talk, most jump straight in. Especially if its the initial screening call to sus out actual fitness. Also, never join a call half hour early. That looks bad as well. \n\nJoin maximum 1-5 mins early. But never half hour. They might have not noticed you were already on it and were waiting for a \"x joined the call\" ping closer to time and assumed you weren't coming.\n\nYou also dont call out your potential higher up in an interview for doing anything but paying attention to you, you dont like it, you end the interview or suck it up and stick till the end.

No matter where you eventually find employment, you are going to be working with people who have been using the same applications all day for 30 years and still don\u2019t know how to use it. People who have worked on a computer for 8 hours a day for nearly 40 years and still don\u2019t understand how to launch an application or navigate to a website.

Jobs aren't easy to get, degree or not because, spoiler, most people have degrees now and they're basically worthless unless you can do something to stand out.\n\nSimple fact is you almost certainly would've got the job if you'd kept cool about it, contact centres well hire pretty much anyone as long as they can chat shit for twenty minutes, and in my experience that's all a CS interview is designed to do, it's got nothing to do with what you can actually do.\n\nIt's also much easier to find a job when you're already in one - for some stupid reason that matters to companies.", "You chose to act this way during the only interview you were able to get?

I don't think that is really that crazy. Depending on the company, it can be quite realistic.\n\nYTA. You made your mom place of work worse for her because you couldn't keep your ego in check.
