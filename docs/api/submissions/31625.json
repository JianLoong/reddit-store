Thank you ahead of time for your help. My husband (M/29), and I (F/29) have known each other for legitimately our entire lives. Our grandparents were friends and vacation-buddies with each other. Their kids (our parents) all basically grew up together too. Then, we were the 3rd generation of growing up doing everything together. \nWe naturally were \u201cin love\u201d from an early age, and were each others \u201cfirst\u201d for just about everything. Though, when college came we went our separate ways. I went to a college in upstate NY, got super into hockey (players), and my own personal fitness. I was even out-lifting many of the D1 hockey guys by my Sr year. \nMy husband went to a school down south, and let\u2019s just say he partied more than most. \nBy the time college was over, we each had had our fun elsewhere, and began to rekindle our relationship/spark from our teenage years. A few months later we got engaged, then a year and a half after that, married. \nNow, we\u2019ve been married for a few years. I am an accountant with a large, local firm. I make 6-figures and have my own department. My husband didn\u2019t cut it in several of his internal accounting positions. And recently went back to school to become a school-teacher. He subs part-time as well. \nIn addition to our career trajectories being mis-matched, our levels of fitness are skewed that way as well. I\u2019ve mostly maintained my strength and overall level of fitness since college. It\u2019s even a bit of a running joke between some of our friends that I\u2019m stronger than their husbands too. My hubby always laughs it off in those moments.\n\nBut recently he is starting to get \u201cdisheartened\u201d to say the least, about where we each stand in life. I\u2019m having my own issues with the burden being the sole provider in our home, as well as the main cook, cleaner, laundry doer, etc. AND there is also this underlying tension around me being stronger than him physically as well. \nWe\u2019ve attempted to talk it out, but we just start arguing like we are 16 again, and he storms out.

Instead of asking AITA, maybe you should be asking did I marry the right partner?  You have a successful career, are physically healthy and still make time to do housework and YOU feel guilty? \n\nYour husband is struggling with an identity crisis. Does he really need to be married to a frail daisy that is less successful than he to feel good about himself or can accept you for who you are and be a partner in your relationship? That\u2019s the question I would be asking myself and him if I were you.", "NTA\n\n\n\nBut honestly sounds like you are more the maid as a life partner. Why are you the one doing the chores? To me it sounds like your husband feels emasculated because he acts like a child. He could take care of his fitness, he could be a life partner at home. He choses not to.", "INFO so he has a teachers salary, which isn't much,  but did you say you were the sole provider AND you do most of the housework?\n\nWhat exactly does he do/contribute?", "NTA. Just because you have been the main provider, it doesn't mean that you have emasculated your husband. If he is emasculated, it is pretty much because he p*ssed away his opportunities at college. Not your fault. He should be eternally gratefull that you didn't do the same, as you should both be living in a ditch by now if you had. I think he needs therapy and he needs to start taking himself, you, your relationship and life in general, seriously. But, just as it takes a man who is comfortable with his masculinity to wear a pink rucksack, it takes the same for a man whose wife is the main breadwinner, hence the therapy.", "INFO so he has a teachers salary, which isn't much,  but did you say you were the sole provider AND you do most of the housework?\n\nWhat exactly does he do/contribute?", "YTA for being an independent strong woman that cares for her health. /s\n\nHe seems angry that he is not a a provider, that he cant even say that he would protect you etc. He is angry, because in his own mind he have no manly characteristic in your relationship. So  he doesnt have a purpose. Also its probably easy to see that you earn more, look better etc. so he cant even pretend that he is more 'manly' than he is.", "NTA. My husband went through something similar. He eventually began to accept, and even embrace our roles in the house. It\u2019s not like we planned it this way, they just began to happen naturally. I make more money, and can handle a lot more of the literal heavy lifting around the house. He has gotten better about cleaning/cooking/dealing with the kids/etc. Your husband just needs some time to let the situation sink in. Good luck, girl!", "Esh - I think most of the problem lies in the fact that you both prioritize gender roles in theory. I think one of the key phrases here is \"as a wife should.\" \n\nThere is no \"should\" there is only figuring out what works in your relationship. From what I've read, what doesn't function in this relationship is him. He's the only one to blame for that. It's not like you've drastically changed between marriage and now, you were already on this trajectory when you got back together. I hold nothing morally against him for being physically weaker or in a lower earning job than you, he's no less of a man for it in my eyes, the problem to me is that he's whining about not feeling like he's enough instead of making an effort to be better. \n\nYou, on the other hand, shouldn't be cool with your friends regularly making jokes that make him uncomfortable, or lean on your gender role to justify how you treat him in public if he has a problem with how you do that", "ESH- it\u2019s fine and perfectly normal to have different career trajectories, hobbies and incomes. It\u2019s not a competition, it\u2019s a partnership. Maybe yall need to go to therapy to talk through the tension and figure some things out.", "Hm. The way you talk about him and what he does in the main text and the comments feels off. You talk down about him, and if that comes off at home I can understand how he would feel that way.\n\nHe's training to be a teacher. It's a meaningful and super important job. Money, a different type of job and going to the gym doesn't make you superior. YTA.", "NTA. What does he expect you to do in this situation? Quit your job and get fat so he can feel like a man again. He just sounds like he doesn't want to own up to his shortcomings so he is blaming you. Next time he complains just tell him \"to do something about it\". It's not your problem in the slightest.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you hold yourself in pretty high regard. It also sounds like you feel entitled to a certain level of worship for your physical greatness and intellectual prowess that your husband no longer finds attractive. You're now offended that he cannot see the wonders that are you and not only accept but embrace your critical assessments of him, from his physical being to his less than capable mind, because somehow, you've also twisted your mind into believing the you are not only his superior in every important way, but also a victim of his useless existence. \n\nSome food for thought: Imagine you had an accident tomorrow that changed your amazing physique into a wheelchair bound mass of uncontrollable muscle. Imagine that due to this accident, you also lost your fantastic job. What then would you have to offer your husband? What memories have you created for him to cherish in his times of struggle these past few years that he can now reflect upon when he needs inspiration to overcome his weariness and tend to your many needs? Shall he depend on his feelings of devotion to you? Shall he remind himself that you are in a bad spot and really need his compassion? Shall his love for you compel him to offer you support and encouragement as you face your daily battles and contemplate your fears of the future?", "NTA AT ALL! Do you have kids yet? I hope he has not/will not poison their minds with this stupid traditional gender stereotypes. Sounds like mommy needs to give daddy a serious butt-kicking to shut him up!", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s jealous you\u2019re life is going well whilst his hasn\u2019t and it\u2019s not great that he appears to be resentful of that partners are supposed to support each other, you\u2019ve emasculated him? What rubbish is that to say. Why do you do all the chores? You have a full time job he has full time school so why isn\u2019t it being split?

If he doesn't like that you can out-lift him, Planet Fitness is cheap, he can take himself over there and put in the work. As for your career, if he is uncomfortable because you have more success that's also on him, he should have spent less time partying and more time on his studies. If he's \"emasculated\" it's not your fault.", "I tend to agree with most of this. Thank you for your feedback!! And I think he\u2019s feeling that emasculating not only from me being the breadwinner. But also because I\u2019m legitimately a good amount stronger than him. Like, on most of the leg machines I can nearly double the weight he can do. Which doesn\u2019t bother me, at all. But he isn\u2019t handling that part well either. More so recently as the financial part has stacked up on him too.", "I agree with this. I think men that use the term emasculated are probably struggling with low self esteem to begin with. OP may not be saying anything condescending or dismissive. Her SO\u2019s sense of self worth may be fragile anyway, and totally benign statements from OP could be (are likely) taken the wrong way. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this, OP. I think therapy would be really helpful for your husband.", "No, he is still in school and substitute teaching a day or two a week. Brings in roughly $800/month. So for purposes of our budget, I am basically the sole provider of the house. When he was jumping around his previous accounting jobs, he was making roughly $45-$55K. That was much more helpful. And likely what he will be back to when he begins teaching full time.", "The whole \u201cprotect\u201d thing comes up pretty regularly actually. One time, after winning a playful wrestling match we had, I joked that he doesn\u2019t have to worry because I will protect him if anyone breaks in. And now we sometimes talk about it and how he hates that he can\u2019t protect me. But he hasn\u2019t done much, if anything, about it since. So, for now I\u2019ll continue to be the \u201cprotector\u201d if I need to be lol.", "Thank you! That\u2019s how I feel too. If you\u2019d asked me, I definitely would have assumed that my future hubby would be stronger than me, and make more money, and all those stereotypes. But in reality, it doesn\u2019t always work like that. And with us, I happen to have more of the traditionally masculine traits, and roles in the house. But he\u2019s having a much harder time like accepting or embracing it. What did it take for your husband to come around?", "Oh sorry. No when I said \u201cas a wife should\u201d it was more of a generalization. I just meant I\u2019m trying to help him, as anyone who cares about him, would. Not strictly because I\u2019m his wife. \nAs for the jokes. I don\u2019t let those happen much anymore. But they\u2019ve been going on for so long. A few of his buddies can\u2019t let it go and still ask us to arm wrestle and stuff when they get to drinking. \nOtherwise I\u2019m trying to walk on eggshells as much as I can reasonably do, while mentally occupied with everything else in our home. Thanks for your feedback!", "Not at all! At least not on purpose. I\u2019m CONSTANTLY trying to uplift his mood. And I\u2019m very proud of him for being a teacher. Lord knows some kids these days need a good teacher. And when he gets his full-time position things will be better, I\u2019m sure. But for the last several years, he\u2019s been a part-time sub teacher making a few thousand a year. I\u2019ve been carrying the household in every other way. And still keeping a lighthearted mood.", "Lol. Sounds personal. Sorry that happened to you. \nBut as for my hubby and I. Not at all. We\u2019ve known each other our entire lives and are legitimately best friends. He is just going through a bit of s rough patch. And nothing I do or say helps. In fact, any help or words I offer are being misconstrued. \n\nYou\u2019ve never seen me, or my physique. But thank you for calling it amazing. I still strip, dance, and flex different muscles for him, just playfully like I used to, while he\u2019s doing his studying. He always loves that. We have a great relationship overall. \nI\u2019m just having a bit of a hard time after 3 years of being solely responsible for him, our house, and everything we own. And he\u2019s having the same hard time from the other side.", "No kids, yet! Probably won\u2019t try again until he\u2019s established in his new career. He\u2019s overall a good man and won\u2019t do that to the kids. Though, I\u2019ll keep the butt-kicking in my back pocket for if mommy ever does need to set daddy straight.   Lol JK!", "Sorry. My first time posting on here. What else do you need to know?", "How long is he is school for? Because while starting again is valid, it basically means you are now responsible for everything. \n\nAnd not every rlship can handle that type of imbalance of contribution.", "Well that's unfortunately what being a partner is about. He's working on a career, in school/training it's not like he's not been doing anything.", "Wow, your situation sounds different in this post than the original one. You asked if you were the AH in a situation almost as if you wanted honest opinions from random strangers. If it's all good over at your place, why didn't you just say so?", "For the most part, im thinking you're NTA, but the following statement needs clearing up, I think...\n\n>He has made claims that I\u2019ve emasculated him, ridiculed him, been condescending to him, and outright embarrassed him in public, about both our financial situation, and fitness levels. \n\nYou kind of gloss over how you respond to his concerns here by saying these things (which aren't wrong but kind of vague)\n\n>I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve done any of those things. \n\n>Simply tried to offer him advice\n\nYou are in a partnership with this person, and how you react and respond to your partner is crucial to making the partnership work.\n\nI'm not saying you are doing anything wrong, but I feel you explained how your partner has interacted with you but not how you have interacted back to your partner.\n\nDo you think his statements about being possibly condescending  or embarrassing him in public or the other things have any merit?", "He finally finishes this coming spring. But it\u2019s been 3 years of him doing schoolwork all day. While I go to work, go to the gym, make most meals, clean up most meals, clean the house (except \u201chis\u201d bathroom). And he\u2019s busy with schoolwork. And that\u2019s important. But I do everything else now. And sometimes I guess I\u2019ve let a comment or two go. \nAnd for the fitness thing, he has begun to accept that part more. He recently waited for me to get home so I could move our large dresser for him\u2026", "For him or with him?", "For him. He recognizes that he\u2019s not the right one for that job in our house. And he will likely end up breaking something, or himself. So he has started to wait, and ask me to lift/move/carry stuff for him. Especially if it\u2019s really heavy and/or fragile."]}
