You could have worded it far more tactfully or simply said \"I'm telling you that we can't make it this year, and won't accept being interrogated by you regarding why\". \n\nBut if you don't see your sister often, and you care about her (and the other family members she's inviting), then it's hard to imagine why one night of bad food would stop you from attending.", "YTA\n\nThat was unnecessary rude.\n\n>\u00a0She doesnt try to improve her cooking\n\nMaybe she likes what she cooks?

But to your credit you only said that after she kept pressuring you, but it still does not make it okay.", "YTA - Honesty is not always the best policy. You are factually correct, that doesn't mean you're morally correct.", "YTA. Why not offer to make a dish instead? Jeez.", "YTA - You could still show up for just drinks or to see the family.", "YTA, but when someone hosts and doesn't say potluck, they are taking the responsibility to cook.\n\nYou don't have to be rude to decline an invitation.

I have wanted to tell one of my Aunts this for years! Everyone comes to my house because I was the only one interested in family recipes and the realization that people don't live forever.

There's such a thing as being **too** honest.\n\nYou could have turned down the invite without immediately going to criticism, or you could have sucked up some mediocre food for the sake of spending holidays with the family.", "YTA.\n\nYou definitely could have worded that better. I get not wanting to go somewhere where the food sucks but the way you acted was definitely out of line. One of my aunts used to insist on hosting Thanksgiving and she's a terrible cook - so we'd generally bring as much of our own food as we could as sides to 'help out' but also have something that - to put it bluntly - didn't taste like ass. Also, you could have asked your SO to help you out in trying to not hurt their sister's feelings but still let her know you didn't want to go.", "Your response completely disregards the entire idea behind Thanksgiving in the first place.    \n\n\nA better way to handle it?  \"Sure, we'd love to come!  I'd love to swing by early and help cook, if you wouldn't mind!\"  Other than that, bring a dish yourself and just be grateful that you have family that wants to spend time with you.  YTA.", "YTA \n\nThanksgiving is far more about coming together as a family than the actual food. Even if it is truly about the food, there are far more tactful ways to handle it. \n\nEither bring a couple of delicious sides you made or even privately tell her what was off and offer to go over and help her cook some of the dishes you particularly disliked. (Like that cream of mushroom green bean crapola).\n\nI offered to cook prime rib one year because turkey is rather bland and it\u2019s been a huge hit for several years since.\n\nNow, if you just want a relaxing Thanksgiving at home, that\u2019s a completely understandable alternative, but just say that rather than your food sucks so I\u2019m not coming.", "NTA/ESH, you tried to deflect but she pushed.", "Huge asshole", "YTA for this bait post. At least make an effort. This is a minus 1 on a scale of 10.", "Idk i dont think so thats your opion and cooking really isnt as hard as people make it out to be its an easy fix but maybe do a pot luck at their house so its not all her food haha but in gonna say nta", "Enough with the bullshit AITA posts.  This is either made up bait, or OP is so beyond asshole that it's difficult to quantify.", "YTA because you could have been an adult and offer the suggestion that everyone brings a dish to have more options and less stress over cooking for her. You could have offered to help cook. You\u2019d rather burn bridges than to compromise or offer helpful suggestions that would fix the food problem.", "YTA. You know that saying \u201chonesty is the best policy\u201d? That\u2019s bullshit. Especially when it comes to insulting and upsetting people. I\u2019ll bet there are many things you do that could be better, same as everyone else, so ask yourself how you\u2019d feel if people you love said they weren\u2019t coming to see you on a special occasion because you suck at something. Not nice, is it?", "ESH", "Ah, you're part of the \"I'm just being honest\" club. You're also the part of the asshole club.\n\nYTA OP, lame. So what if your food sucks? Not a reason to stay away and if you do, completely unnecessary to give that as a reason. Be nicer.\n\nEdit: pressed enter too soon", "YTA. You couldn't come up with something constructive? Why would you so quickly make these hurtful remarks? Yeesh. How about having some appreciation for the effort that goes into hosting a group for a big meal?

Let's not pretend otherwise.", "YTA. rude much?", "How would you feel if your SIL told you your breath stinks? Sucker punch to the stomach right? Well that\u2019s what you did to her. \n\nYTA for the delivery of that news. \n\nYou could opt to host \n\nYou could opt to cook some dishes if she\u2019s hosting \n\nYou could eat before you go and eat only a bit if her cooking \n\nYou could ask her if she wants to take some cooking lessons with you because it would be fun to learn new things \n\nSee how you may have spared her feelings??", "Of course YTA , you're horribly rude.", "YTA, you could have said anything else or offered to help cook", "YTA.  Grab yourself a BigMac before you head over, then nibble politely and enjoy the family.", "YTA. Rude, and of course it's upset her. \n\nYou're a married adult, you darn well should be able to do better than this! Offer to help, to make a main, a dessert, or come over and be sous or saucier to lighten her load.

You're under no obligation to attend family gatherings, but if you get along reasonably why not get together?", "Pro life tip: Thanksgiving isn\u2019t actually about the food.", "YTA... but you know this already.", "This can\u2019t be real\u2026 you can\u2019t be this horrible, right? Could have just stuck to your guns about wanting a low key thanksgiving instead of being mean.", "That was rude of you. I have a friend whose wife's cooking sucks.

I would never tell them that the food they cook sucks.", "INFO: do you help or bring food at all?", "I can't think of a situation where telling someone they're a bad cook to their face wouldn't be a YTA situation. \n\nIt's a holiday - good food is a nice bonus. If you know food is going to be bad, you bring a dish to share or you swing by a drive-through on the way. My grandma was a TERRIBLE cook who planned her meals with zero consideration for anyone's dietary needs (not because she was an asshole or didn't believe egg allergies were real - it would just never cross her mind that maybe quiche isn't the best thing to have as the primary dish at brunch if someone in the family has an egg allergy). If having good food was a requirement, we'd have never celebrated a single holiday with her.", "YTA. Thanksgiving isn't just about the food. Did you offer to cook or help in any way?", "YTA for being rude AF.", "YTA\n\nFrom her reaction, I assume you have never, in a kind way, told her you had a problem with her cooking.\n\nMaybe no one has ever told her there is an issue, so why would you expect someone to improve something that they don't know is a problem?", "Wow.

I've never had a Turkey that someone put a lot of effort into that was bad - and the only time I've had a good low effort Turkey it was deep fried (and if you count all the effort that goes into setting up the frier and cleaning out the frier at the end then it still isn't low effort).", "Op tried to let her off easy but she kept pushing for an answer.

My grandmother was one. From apps to coffee and desserts, she was the *only* cook. If you brought a dish to pass it would somehow get relocated to the garage. The only thing she would bend on is if you wanted to bring beer, since she didn\u2019t like keeping alcohol in the home.", "I don't mind if someone brings something else, but it's irritated me when I've been invited to potlucks, wires got crossed and I brought what I said I would but others also brought it and now we're missing things a lot of us consider classic if it's a classic meal (yes sometimes things are different like tacos or whatever). When I've hosted I've always done it all but asked for ice/random missing ingredients I forgot (usually not day of so doable) and my family had mostly been the same. Random thing forgotten, and ice. Easy to be sure you've covered the stuff you know your family loves that way. \nOn that note why host when you know people don't like your food?", "I guess Im sort of the same way, minus food in the garage lol I make the whole meal for my guests.
