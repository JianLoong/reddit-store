I have a friend who does this and it always stirs up so much unnecessary drama.", "Mmm this comment reminded me of the time my friend who worked at Walmart clued us into the fact they were having a huge sale on turkeys because they bought way too many in like February for some reason. So they were something crazy like 10 cents a pound.\n\nWe got like 3 10 lbs turkeys, gave one to the friend that told us, rather generically baked one of them, but the third. Ohhh the third one we brined and injected for like 3 days, and then once it was finally ready we smoked it on the grill over wine soaked cherry woodchips. It was amazing. If I manage to get a house and end up hosting Thanksgiving, we're doing something like that again lol.", "Personally, I think people deserve whatever they get when they press.

I am pretty sure she could figure it out. My husband often criticized her cooking. Wasn't my mother; wasn't my place to \"tell it like it is.\"", "I feel ya! When people try this crap on me, I just say, \"I can give the polite answer or the truth. Which one do you want?! And be careful what you ask for!\"\n\nIf they are dumb enough to ask for the truth, I give it to them with both barrels. Cry me a river, you asked.", "Nah, people are allowed to be offended by your shitty judgemental opinions, even if you try to hide them.  The reason they are \"pushing\" is because they know you are being an ass and they sense you are also lying to them.\n\n\"Screw you I don't value your company becuase your food is different to what I prefer\" is a shitty attitude to have, full stop.", "Yeah. I love bacon, but I feel it would definitely ruin a turkey. Anything you wrap in bacon mostly just ends up tasting like bacon. I always brine my turkey, but I also baste it occasionally as it helps to get the skin a bit crispier.", "If she didn\u2019t accept his original answer what makes you think she would accept that one?", "You might be right!", "My go to is \"Would you like me to be blunt or would you like me to consider your feelings?\" I feel that with this one sentence OP could have been NTA", "And I don't like crispy skin on a turkey. If I want crispy, I'll go get some fried chicken :)", "My go to is wet brine heavy on rosemary and garlic then smoke it. Broil for 10-15 minutes to crisp the skin if you desire.

Thanks. I think I'll try it on my  turkey for TG.", "lol right!", "Rinse and repeat as necessary; OP wasn't chained to the floor, and was free to leave the conversation. SIL did *not* back OP into some corner where there was no option, this is what OP *chose* to say.", "To each their own. I normally never eat the turkey skin, but most people I know prefer it crispy. If you don't baste, the skin just ends up soggy and fatty. When you crisp up the skin, lots of the fat also melts and helps keep the meat juicier.", "And when you don\u2019t respect people\u2019s boundaries you may learn an uncomfortable truth.", "That they're willing to run roughshod over yours? \n\nYou can and should hold your boundaries but it doesn't give you leave to violate others.

Doubly so for trying to be offensively blunt and then saying they don't know why SIL is upset.", "Did you make yourself the AmItheAsshole finale verdict lol. In my opinion, he is the justified asshole. If someone doesn\u2019t take no for an answer the first time, then when they learn the truth it is on them. The reality is he doesn\u2019t like her cooking. He didn\u2019t call her a name. If someone said they didn\u2019t like my cooking I would just laugh. It\u2019s not that serious.", "YTA. \n\nLook. I get it. My SIL's cooking sucks too. Some of it can't be helped due to her husband's food allergies, some of it is due to her and her brother (my BIL) being on a new diet, and some of it is my own preferences. But I'm still going to her place this year, and I'm not gonna make a big fuss about the food. There will likely be stuff I find gross, and I won't eat it. There will also probably be stuff that's just tolerable, and I'll probably eat some of it. Thanksgiving is about more than just the food. It's about being together and being thankful for your blessings. \n\nI'm also planning a \"Friendsgiving\" the Tuesday before Thanksgiving with just a couple friends, so I can still make some of my own favorite dishes. \n\nIt was so unnecessary to decline and insult your SIL's cooking. The better person would just suck it up for one day, decline taking any leftovers, and then make their own favorite dishes when they get home of they feel like they \"missed out\" on the food. Heck! You could even bring your own favorite dish to share! That way, you know there will be at least one dish you enjoy at the dinner.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA and you know it.", "Yes YTA, but I fell off my chair laughing.", "YTA. It\u2019s possible to decline an invitation without insulting the host. \u201cThank you, but we\u2019ve already made other plans\u201d would have been sufficient here. I\u2019d be pissed too.", "YTA\n\nI doubt you're a Gordon Ramsey yourself. Why wouldn't you say something like \"Sure, we will be there. I'll come help prep everything and we can catch up while having wine\". You could have said anything really, but \"you suck\" is unnecessary and you come off as the worst.", "YTA.", "YTA.  You can make any excuse.  It is very rude to say something like that even though you are trying to be honest.", "YTA and rude.", "YTA - terribly rude so really shows your lack of etiquette and kindness", "NTA - she could have accepted your original excuse", "I just dropped my dog of at a friend\u2019s house who\u2019s going to look after him when we go away. The house and kitchen were REALLY dirty, dog hair (normal) everywhere, food, dirty plates, floor, surfaces, table\u2026 all obviously neglected for quiet a few days. If they ever invite is over for dinner, it\u2019s a 100% decline BUT will I tell them why? Hell no. Even when pressed. Sometimes you just got to bite your tongue or lie throughout your teeth. You should\u2019ve done that.", "So, uh, why don\u2019t all the guests offer to bring a dish? If you\u2019re all such superior chefs, why don\u2019t you bring some of your delicious, delicious food?  (YTA)", "NTA.\n\nY'all politely declined, and it should have ended there.\n\nYour sister learned a valuable lesson:\n\n* If you keep trying to prod a person or people over an answer, don't get upset if you get an answer that you are not fond of.", "NTA.  Your SIL needs to learn not to ask questions if she really can't handle the answer, it's simple.  You tried to be polite in saying you were planning a Thanksgiving at home...she kept pestering so you told her.\n\nNow, food tastes do vary person to person and there was surely a more polite way to say it, like \"I'm sorry but we just aren't fans of your cooking. It's probably just our tastes as we like things more spicy/savory/moist. Thank you so much for the invite though.\"\n\nMost of my memorable life my mom's Thanksgiving turkey was soooo dry, like there was never enough gravy available to make it okay DRY.  One year she asked why there was always so much left. I said, \"Honestly, it's too dry. The flavor is fine, but it's very dry.\"  She was a little hurt but the next year she brined it and that helped a ton...now she gets a fresh bird instead of previously frozen and that has made all the difference.  But had we all just continued to bite our tongues we'd all just be tolerating dry-ass turkey year after year...sometimes you just need to tell people, but i would recommend trying to pin point the specifics of the \"suck\" instead of a general statement...unless it is all that bad. LOL", "Thanksgiving is about being with your family regardless of the food. It's great when the food is tasty but if you skip because of the food YTA and definitely AH to tell her the way you did.", "ESH\n\nYou answered. Sister in law pushed.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily agree with the way you said it, but being harangued by somebody until you give them an answer is a poor way of existing too. So I understand.\n\nCould you have been nicer? Yes. Did sister in law get what was coming for nagging? Also yes.", "NTA- she fucked around and found out.  You tried to dodge the issue, but you helped her in the long run.", "Yeah, you're TA, but not a big one. I don't blame you for not wanting to suffer through a less than enjoyable meal, but coming out and telling your SIL that her food sucks is pretty harsh. A little tact would have gone a long way to soften the blow. Offering to help cook, or maybe gently suggesting a potluck, buffet style dinner so that everyone can bring their faves and no one would have to work too hard and you can all relax and enjoy the day together would take some pressure off of her and make her feel better about it.", "Did you try explaining this to her before? You came across rude for no reason. YTA", "Sometimes ppl need to hear the ugly truth! \ud83d\ude02 like Thanksgiving is not your Friday night fish fry\u2026 ppl wanna eat good. She pushed now she knows. Maybe next year she\u2019ll practice they say it makes perfect lol", "Who's we", "Info- did you actually/literally say \u201cyour food sucks?\u201d", "You don't see why she's upset? Really?! You can't figure out why she's miffed at hearing \"your food sucks so we're not coming over.\"\n\nMassive YTA. Not just for that, but for pretending you don't know you're an AH.", "Made the mistake of eating food I didn't like on more than a few occasions. MIL made it again some time later. Realized it's better to be honest and upfront about it so they don't get the idea in their head that you liked it because you ate it. \n\nAlso, depending on the family relationship, it's perfectly normal to roast your SIL cooking if the relationship is built on snarky remarks. But if not, then you telling her is more about rubbing it in her face over trying to have a good thanksgiving dinner. \n\nLastly, if the food sucks, maybe you can step up and make food even if she's hosting.", "ESH.", "Yeah yta. The correct response is: I have already planned dinner for our family Thursday, but we would love to come by after dinner. Perhaps we could bring desert?", "YTA", "I mean you could just offer to bring some sides and a ham or something ..eat before you go and then ENJOY your family", "That is funny to me!  Honesty May spire her to try to do better.  Maybe send her some cook books for Christmas?", "YTA. Why don\u2019t you offer to help cook, maybe you can teach her some stuff?", "NTA \n\nShe pushed. But you could have said you don\u2019t like her cooking. She still would have flipped out though.", "YTA: Wait until she refuses to come over due to your manners requiring improvement", "YTA, Thanksgiving is for the occasion and family not the food, if you really don't like her cooking just bring something with you.", "YTA.\n\nWhy did you feel it necessary to put someone down instead of  offering a solution like everyone bring something?  Or ordering in.", "NTA \n\n\n>she kept pressing me on why We werent coming\n\nShe should have just accepted the \"no\".", "YTA\n\nMy SIL talks about how she\u2019s a great cook like their grandma was. She is not a a great cook but the rest of their family has always reinforced this perspective. I think her food is edible but is either unseasoned, overcooked and/or undercooked. I think your point about different tastes is a real thing.

I would honestly say my sister's cooking sucks because she way over cooks her meat. But she like her meat that way.", "It could also be her family's holiday recipe so she doesn't want to change it because it means something special to her\n\nBut she definitely shouldn't have kept pressing unless the \"kept pressing\" was her asking \"oh why would you rather that than come here, as you sure you don't wanna come here?\" In which that's not being *pushy* that's just asking why", "Because it's Thanksgiving,  one of the most important meals of the year.", "Right? If SIL's food is terrible - don't eat it. Before leaving for her house, eat your own gourmet meal, swing by McDonald's, whatever. You won't starve if you go for 4 hours without eating.", "*that telling someone that their food sucks if you\u2019re not Gordon Ramsey is unnecessarily rude.*\n\nYou don't need to to be a world class cook to know that food should be seasoned or not burnt, etc.  Even a decent home cook can recognize truely horrible cooking.", "Maybe that's what this person wants.. to keep their spouse away from their family.. sounds like a narcissistic a hole", "My sister did Thanksgiving one year. The turkey \"looked\" amazing but was dry as the Sahara. She was smart enough to say that it was bad and left it back up to my brother and sister-in-law to do in the future. They are amazing cooks. I know my limitations, so don't even bother offering, I just bring some sides and let them do their magic.", "My MIL was a terrible cook too although thankfully she also didn't like to cook, so she mostly just nuked stuff or bought premade stuff at the store. She did make a few things that were okay, but she wasn't up to hosting Thanksgiving, lol.", "Someone told me of grocery store baggers mistreating their deviled eggs; I suggested they be nestled on a cloud", "That seems like a good solution: \u2018our tastes/ dietary needs are just very different. Shall we bring <totally yummy dish>?", "Let your spouse talk to them, its their sister", "Your sis may be horrible however she didn\u2019t paint her SIL as a horrible person. Just persistent and a bad cook. Idt insulting her cooking was appropriate even if she were annoyingly pushy.", "Maybe a restaurant heat n serve dinner", "I never heard of a potluck where the host did all the cooking. There weren\u2019t multiple dishes to choose from brought by different people?", "You're living a delusion if you think she would accept that.\n\nIf someone can't accept a no, no other answer would suffice", "Yeah, that's what we used to get her, especially during the later years or from a grocery store.", "\u2026how are people being an ass by just having an opinion? The attempt at hiding them is nice, but people aren\u2019t wrong for having thoughts or feelings other people won\u2019t like \ud83d\ude02", "Was also confused by this.
