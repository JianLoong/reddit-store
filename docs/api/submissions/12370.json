I\u2019m all with you for being kind to service workers. However that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok or a service worker is somehow off the hook for shaming customers and being rude. If a service worker is doing that then it\u2019s well within your rights to say something.", "NTA.

Good for your for reporting.", "NTA - you are paying for a service, not judgement. This is like when cashiers at grocery stores think its appropriate/funny to make comments on what a customer is buying. Like, it's no one's business. The worker should know to keep comments like that to themselves, as it had no merit or impact on \\*anything accept in judging you\\*", "NTA.

If this were a one-time thing, maybe you could chalk it up to the person having a bad morning or reacting to a strange combination and not catching themselves. However, it sounds like a pattern. \n\nThe hope is always that management won't frivolously fire someone for a single complaint but they would try to work to improve their performance first. However, you can't really control that, so reporting in any case isn't wrong.", "NTA I work customer service, the customer is always right means you keep your opinions to yourself. She can think all she wants to that your meal was large or odd combos or too high salt or whatever but she cannot roll her eyes and make a comment out loud that is rude to you, her customer, a person she is probably not allowed to be rude to as per her job. Don't feel bad for reporting her this is an attitude that needs correction, and if they did fire her it would likely be bc she has done this more than once and not just to you.", "I treat service workers how I want to be treated.  If I have a bad day and am crabby with someone at the office do I expect to get reported to my manager?  No I don't.  If I'm consistently an asshole to someone then that's reasonable.

Why would I? I'm not paying for it and I'm not eating it; my opinion on the matter means nothing.", "That is hella weird. I definitely thought personal thoughts when I worked at subway, but mostly just like I would never eat that thoughts, couldn't care less if someone else does though. Had someone order just plain bread mayo and ham cause the kid was picky. Definitely wasn't worth the money, but none of my business.", "Right? The only time we should care what other people eat is to make sure they have enough.", "Nothing weird at all imo. A biscuit, eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns.", "Frankly, I disagree with \"the customer is always right\" on principle, but thank you for your input", "If you were unprofessional with me in an office to the degree I was upset about it, damn straight I'm going to your manager, AH.", "That's kind of the crux of why I sought judgment. If I had to say, I guess what I want is for that not to happen again. It's my place of work, and that's the best of few options I have for a hot breakfast. As I mentioned in the post, it's the first time I've ever asked for someone's supervisor.\n\nEdit: For what it's worth, I don't think your analogy holds. If I understand you correctly, you're implying that if one isn't equally likely to go to management about good behavior, it's hypocritical to go over bad. Part of what a service worker is being paid for is to perform the emotional labor of being kind to people. Courtesy. Breaching that is more egregious than going the other way.", "That is literally a normal breakfast. She sounds miserable. NTA", "In that case,NTA. That sounds like a normal breakfast. If it happens again, ask her point blank what her  problem is.", "That just sounds like a typical breakfast, especially if you do physical work. \n\nI hope you dont end up dwelling on this. Her attitude needed adjusting and speaking to a supervisor is much better than cussing her out publicly.", "I'm with you, but I like the version that says \"The customer is always right in matters of taste,\" meaning if someone wants to order a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich, then you take their order without arguing even if you think it's weird. You're fully NTA, OP, there's literally no reason to make nasty comments about someone's food choices. That kind of attitude creates disordered eating, and if this lady is so obsessed with dietary choices, then working in food service seems like a bad place for her.", "Well obviously the customer is sometimes very, very wrong but my place of work interprets that phrase as \"don't argue with or be visibly rude to the customer, regardless of whether or not they are correct.\"", "My point is.  There is tolerable service, then levels above and below that.  If you are willing to go to a manager for someone doing less than tolerable service, but wouldn't do it for someone going above and beyond and providing excellent service, I do think its hypocritical.  You only want someone punished, but you are less likely to want them rewarded.  What does that say about you?\n\nEdit:  I'm curious why this is downvoted.  Do people not see it as a problem for being quick to want punishment but wanting to hold back rewards or praise?  Think about your job.  If your manager is quick to criticize but rarely praises you, how do you feel?", ">You only want someone punished, but you are less likely to want them rewarded.\n\n>being quick to want punishment but wanting to hold back rewards or praise \n\nI think this is why. Perhaps this isn't my place as the one seeking judgment, but I think I've made it clear I'm not asking for her to be punished, unless you count getting spoken to about her interactions with customers, which seems fair to me. I also think it's clear that I didn't come to the conclusion quickly or thoughtlessly. So in short, while your arguments may not be unreasonable, your premises at best don't apply here, and that's why you're being downvoted.", "So you went to her supervisor, assumedly pointed her out for \"bad\" behavior, but don't want her to be punished?  Yeah, that is doubtful.  Maybe you don't want her to be fired, but you want some kind of punishment, whether that is just a talking to or something else.  But you want some kind of action taken.", "I dont want her punished--I don't want it to happen anymore. If you're going to ask me a question and then discard my answer, I you're not having a discussion. If you're not going to engage with something I said that interacts with a point you made, you're not having a discussion. If you're going to put \"bad\" in quotes as though it's in question whether or not how she behaved is wrong, you're not having a discussion."]}
