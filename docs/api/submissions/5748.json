That's a very kind euphemism.\n\n>she is mad at me for upstaging her because no one carried on with festivities after me and my husband left\n\nShe does know that there will be another Christmas next year, right?\n\n>She\u2019s calling me out to tell me I\u2019ll be a bad mother and that I had my baby early to hurt her.\n\nThat's a disgusting thing to say.

She can stfu and get over herself.\n\nNTA.", "Nta. There is a large difference between cultural differences and not being able to control when your body decides to go into labor. And hope you and your son are both doing well!!!", "I\u2019m sorry this gave me a good laugh. How could you control when your baby comes? Your SIL sounds awful and I would watch how she treats your son due to what she\u2019s said about you coming from \u201cdifferent people\u201d in the past. \n\nYou are not a bad wife or mother due to your husband helping out in the house. It sounds like your husband was able to move away from his family\u2019s \u201ctraditions\u201d and is a great support for you. \n\nI hope your son is okay, don\u2019t let your husbands family make you feel bad during this very special yet scary time. \n\nNTA and lots of love.", "Wtf NTA. As if you had control over when you went into premature labor. Geez!", "NTA. You had NO control over when your labor started. Your SIL is the AH.", "You are actually unsure if something you had no control over made you an asshole?", "NTA. Your SIL is TA. And if she thinks you deliberately went into premature labor just to spite her, she\u2019s also an idiot. That is not how labor works.", "NTA and you must know that. Are you even seriously listening to her bullshit?", "Yta for not going nuclear on the SIL.  I\u2019m sorry but some people need to be put in their place and this is an example of it.  There\u2019s certain levels of disrespect where you become the asshole for tolerating it and this is one. Let your husband know you want no contact with her and it\u2019s a choice he needs to make", "NTA. How are you questioning that haha", "NTA - you had no control over when you went into labor, SIL is in the wrong, and sounds very backwards thinking.", "NTA. I'm surprised you needed to ask.", "NTA \n\nAnd what?\n\nYour SIL is an a*******e though.", "NTA. Was she expecting you to keep your legs crossed or something to prevent baby from coming? Babies operate on their own schedule.\n\nI hope baby is happy and healthy, and congratulations!", "NTA - Your SIL\u2019s grasp on biology is not very good and how you and your husband choose to split the chores is none of her concern.\n\nYou\u2019re not telling her how to love her life and she should treat you with the same respect.", "Let your husband deal with your SIL. She is exhausting and petty. Congratulations mom!  Don\u2019t let her get inside your head either.", "NTA. Babies come when they want to, not when you choose- even if they are early!\n\nI think that your SIL is jealous because your husband is an actual partner that does his fair share around the house.\n\nYou are not a bad wife at all and your husband is a good husband for actually contributing like a good partner should.", "Have you SIL ever been pregnant?   With her opinions I feel like she hasn't.   My wife had a hard time just breathing near the end of the pregnancy.    Less stress on the mother, the better it is for the baby.   \n\nNTA at all.", "NTA sister is TA.", "NTA. Lmao, she acts like you planned going into labor at that particular moment just to spite her.", "Why are you even questioning this? You cannot control when your body wants to go into labor.", "NTA.

Your SIL is the AH here.", "\"AITA...for going into labor?\"\n\nWhat even is this question lol NTA", "NTA It genuinely concerns me that you're actually wondering if you're the asshole in this situation. Your SIL is clearly a sexist, insufferable, unreasonable asshole.\n\nYou didn't mention anything about how your husband is handling things with your SIL. If your husband is siding with your SIL at all, or not defending you to her, then you have a much bigger issue to worry about.", "NTA my mom went into labour with me on christmas at a christmas party. You inlaws have issues thank god your husband doesn't share his moms views and your SIL is stuck up in her own world. Congratulations on your little one go LC with the in laws with them if you can.", "Wow -what a hateful and egotistical SIL.  There is no way that you timed going into labor during her party on purpose.  And, what your husband does for you is not anyones business.  Enjoy your new baby and don\u2019t let her comments spoil things.", "Your SIL is just stupid.  Unless you get a planned c-section, you can't pick which day you give birth to your child on.

I have never once been talked to  like that by my husband's family.       \n\nDon't attend any of her parities.   She'll only keep on saying bad things about you.   She'll still talk bad about you, but you won't have to listen to it.", "Lol this has to be fake.
