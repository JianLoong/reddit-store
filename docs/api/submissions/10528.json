So I thought. \n\nThe girls stopped getting along as teenagers, so hearing that they had reconnected recently and were even taking trips together was good news. Until last week. 21F posted a picture with 27F apologizing for \"blaming her for the \"situation\" where too much responsibility was put on her\" and thanking her for raising her after their grandmother had passed away **seven** years ago\". \n\nThrough the comments on that post, I found out that the grandmother was not only no longer alive, but had passed soon after the announcement that 21F would be staying with her to finish school. The thread got a lot of attention from our relatives. They're shocked by this, and so am I. \n\nEveryone is assuming that I not only knew about this but approved. I'm getting judgement on all sides. I don't even know how to respond or where to start. I would NEVER have approved of any of this and would have had it out with my husband if I'd even known that he would think of it. I'll admit, I probably could have asked more questions, but I spent the next few years overwhelmed with everything else with all the other kids that I just trusted. I never thought my husband would casually lie about where his kids lived for....I don't even know what reason! To offload them? Start a new life?\n\nRight now, I need to gather information and figure things out, and I'm overwhelmed. I need her to take down the post so I can stop getting bombarded and think for a second. She refuses to take down the post just because I \"can't handle the truth\".

The husband probably went, and OP likely had to stay home with the younger kids. She would have had an infant to care for by then, and it seems the younger stepdaughter lives far enough away that the family wasn't popping over there all the time.\n\nI agree that she shouldn't have asked for the post to come down. But everything else she's being called the AH for? Nah. We truly don't know enough.", "Your husband is liar. Sounds like he wanted to get rid of them.", "While you figure things out, you can always block messages from social media and put your phone on do not disturb and only allow known ok numbers through (husband, kids, etc.). \n\nIt does seem weird af that you never saw her on holidays or her birthday or anything in seven freaking years, though.", "What about his other daughter? What about Christmas?", "YTA. You didn't even care enough to visit her why should she protect you? For 7 years you had no idea where she was? You can't seem to comprehend how you were wrong in this situation. You could have built a relationship but you couldn't even take a day off to visit her with your husband. You weren't a good step mother now you get to deal with the fallout of that. You've made your bed now you have to lie in it.", "So what has your husband said? He is the main issue here and he has been lying to you -", ">I thought we were involved.\n\nInvolved? How can you possibly even think that? You were anything *but* involved for 7 years. 7 years!", "YTA - she\u2019s right. You\u2019re not handling the truth, but after 7 years of basically burying your head in the sand that\u2019s hardly unexpected. \n\nI would ignore the rest of the commentators (the family ones, not Reddit) for now. Just stop reading them. Because your husband lied. He didn\u2019t tell you what was going on. And I can easily see situations like \u201cOP: shall we invite the girls for xmas DH: I have the can\u2019t come\u201d or \u201cOP: shall we visit the girls together DH: they\u2019re not free and it\u2019s too busy I\u2019ll head over\u201d\n\nI know you were overwhelmed letting this be the status quo for 7 years is your main crime. When you say you thought you were involved, you weren\u2019t. Not at all. So stop saying it because it is fundamentally not true. You can\u2019t \u201cbe involved\u201d with someone you don\u2019t see or speak to for 7 years.  \n\nYou need to have it out with your husband. I really hope you update us when you do. I\u2019d love to know how he justifies all this.", "you need to go offline for a while and you need to hash it out with your husband. this is major lies. like massivs. i dont think there is coming back from this. \n\nSoft YTA.", "Ignore all the comments of angry teenagers / stepparents.\n\nYou did what you could.\n\nYou have no responsability to stepdaughters who your husband goes out of his way to hide from you and keep you away from.\n\nAlthough you have no right to keep the stepdaughter from telling about her own situation on social media. I'm not even understanding why all those people are ganging up on you on social media rather than your husband ?\nMaybe they think you were the one whi sent away the girls and they don't know that the whole situation stems from your stepdaughters and husband 's decisions ?", "Then why isn't she mad at him? Like I would be beyond furious and definitely writing a comment on that post that I had know nothing about this because my trash husband LIED to me for seven years. I would be beyond enraged at the betrayal and mortified that I didn't know.", "I\u2019m calling secret family.", "This makes no sense.  She had a 7 year old.  Did she never ensure that the siblings had a relationship.  I think the OP knew but was comfortable as long as this knowledge was subconscious and she could ignore it - just as she would go back to being content now as long as this wasn't public knowledge.", "Wouldn\u2019t you expect to see photos of these meetings! It seems she never did because he never actually went anywhere! My suspicions would eventually come up.", "Pick up the PHONE and talk to her like a human being FFS.", "But the stepdaughter is not her child. And she thought said child, who was not hers, was being cared for by a grandparent. The husband saw his daughter, as makes sense. But marrying a person doesn't mean you're suddenly a parent to their existing children. She had no parental rights or responsibility and no reason to doubt that those who did have responsibility were doing the right thing.", "Why do you recommend contacting a lawyer? What legal matters are relevant. OP, and presumably her husband, are getting dragged through the court of public opinion for something that actually happened. Unless SD is posting something untrue, what possible legal issue is there?", "It's not weird. Not all stepchildren want anything to do with stepparents", "Why don't people get that stepchildren are not automatically a stepparent's responsibility? The younger daughter lived in another city. And OP did have an idea where she was: WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. Y'all really out here acting like she was supposed to have a GPS location on this kid at all times when said kid clearly didn't want a relationship with her.\n\nFrom her perspective the child was cared for. That's all she needed to know.\n\nY'all also keep conveniently skipping over the fact that just after getting married she had a baby. So she's got that going on, which is hard enough, plus two other children who are young and still need raising, and when she inquires about the girl WHO LIVES IN ANOTHER CITY SEVERAL HOURS AWAY the husband says his kid is busy or doesn't want to come or whatever. There is no reason to force things or even see something amiss.", "I'm curious whether the husband actually visited them himself, or went off somewhere else. He's been lying about his daughters all these years, what else is he lying about?", "Right! My first instinct would be to rip my husband a new one not do damage control to protect my image.", "This! The husband's actions are relationship ending, in my opinion. She should be furious with him.", "We're constantly telling stepparents that they need to accept the relationship their new stepchild wants with them, and not push for a closer relationship than the child wants to give. Well OP accepted that her stepchild wanted to live with her grandmother to finish out her schooling. She didn't want her absence; she respected the distance she was told her stepdaughter wanted.\n\nShe was lied to. This is a huge betrayal.", "Hard agree. I don't understand why people are going at her so hard here. Acting like she never checked up on an abandoned child (SHE WAS A MINOR I saw someone scream). Meanwhile, OP thought said minor was living with her grandmother. And it sounds like it was the maternal grandmother, because OP wouldn't have missed that her husband's mom died.\n\nSo she has no idea this kid isn't with the gramma, her husband keeps these details from her, she has a new baby, a child with health complications, and has the idea that the stepdaughters aren't interested in being close to them. What the heck was she supposed to have done???", "She did have a responsibility. She\u2019s not a parent, but as a step parent it is still her duty to help create a family and that means you SEE THE MINOR CHILDREN. \n\nSeven years of holidays, milestones, report cards, birthdays, parent teacher conferences, college visits, job interviews, sports games. \n\nThere was no part of her that said \u201cwhy aren\u2019t these girls invited to holidays?\u201d Or \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen them, let\u2019s go for thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nShe knew her partner had a minor child and that means being willing to include the child in family life. She dropped the ball.\n\nDad sucks more, but her innocent act should not fly. She should have realized that something was wrong.", "Divorce lawyer.", "I mean her husband essentials abandoned his kids and hid it from OP for SEVEN YEARS. I\u2019d be contacting a divorce lawyer immediately because he kept up a rise for seven years.", "At the time=  7 years", "Thank you!! OP is NTA. Everyone is blaming OP instead of her husband, you know, the child's father. He was happy to let his oldest raise the younger one and lie about it. How is OP the villain here? Because she is a woman and it's her job to be more of a parent than the child's actual parent? I don't understand these Y T As.", "When you marry someone with kids, they're your kids and your responsibility. This is not the case of an ex's kid, this is her *husband's* kid, which means her kid. If they're both adults and didn't want a relationship with her, then I guess that's a different story, but the girl was 14 and OP never made any effort to meet them once in 7 years, never even thought to check on them. Doesn't even care enough to be suspicious to never have heard from them in years. Husband is probably the bigger a-hole, but there is no world in which OP is free from blame, especially since she asked the daughter to remove the post, which is nothing but the truth and it's in appreciation of the older sister. YTA.", "He kinda feel like the husband worked really hard to keep this a secret, so you can't really blame her for not overcoming his lies.", "Agree. I don't get the anger people have for OP over that aspect.", "Right. He lied for 7 years.", "You're coming from the perspective of this being a blended family, or even a functional one. The daughters never lived with OP and her husband, and seemed to not want to be around OP or the new family. As a person with a stepmother, I completely understand.\n\nWhen I was 14 I stopped speaking to my father for 9 months. If I had lived in another city and my mom died then, I also would have lobbied to live with my grandparents or aunts. I would never have wanted to live in a house with my stepmom. And honestly, she wasn't super fond of me, either, so we could have gone 7, 10, 20 years not having any contact except for what my dad told her about my life or the very short conversations we'd have when I called and she picked up.\n\nShe wouldn't have known anything about deaths or guardianships or whatever if my dad didn't tell her because, in the end, she was not truly part of my life. And that's okay. My father chose her, I did not.\n\nThe difference in OP's case is that her husband was hiding things from her. He knew the whole truth and kept it from her. He's the real villain here, and I don't understand why so many people are acting like OP is horrible.", "But OP never said anything about hating her SDs. A choice was made for the youngest to stay where she was to finish school. And that choice makes sense to me. OP never said anything about the girl not wanting a relationship with her father or anything like that. From what OP knew, the girl had \"her own life\", and that's it. \n\nWhy no phone call ? No video call ? That would have made sense to keep the relationship with the kid all year long."]}
