So I thought. \n\nThe girls stopped getting along as teenagers, so hearing that they had reconnected recently and were even taking trips together was good news. Until last week. 21F posted a picture with 27F apologizing for \"blaming her for the \"situation\" where too much responsibility was put on her\" and thanking her for raising her after their grandmother had passed away **seven** years ago\". \n\nThrough the comments on that post, I found out that the grandmother was not only no longer alive, but had passed soon after the announcement that 21F would be staying with her to finish school. The thread got a lot of attention from our relatives. They're shocked by this, and so am I. \n\nEveryone is assuming that I not only knew about this but approved. I'm getting judgement on all sides. I don't even know how to respond or where to start. I would NEVER have approved of any of this and would have had it out with my husband if I'd even known that he would think of it. I'll admit, I probably could have asked more questions, but I spent the next few years overwhelmed with everything else with all the other kids that I just trusted. I never thought my husband would casually lie about where his kids lived for....I don't even know what reason! To offload them? Start a new life?\n\nRight now, I need to gather information and figure things out, and I'm overwhelmed. I need her to take down the post so I can stop getting bombarded and think for a second. She refuses to take down the post just because I \"can't handle the truth\".

It obviously didn't bother her that her husband wasn't invested in spending time with his daughters, until it reflected badly on her.", "Umm no. The correct action is for OP\u2019s husband to take full and public responsibility for everything. It\u2019s not on the daughter to correct anything nor does she have a relationship with OP to corroborate her claims of ignorance.", "But that assumes the stepdaughter knew OP was unaware.

If you claim to be firmly an LGBTQIA ally and your partner is homophobic ... people start looking at you differently, how can you call yourself an ally?\n\nOP said she's getting a lot of grief and anger from her own family and friends. This is because her husband by all accounts has been a great father to the kid they have together and her kids, his step kids. And everyone in their lives has just found out her husband stopped communicating with his eldest two kids shortly after his marriage to OP. He abandoned them for his new family, telling everyone that they didn't want to be blended and had requested to live with their Grandma and he was in regular contact. And in reality the Grandma was dead, he forced the 21 yr old sister to be parent and the only support he gave was Xmas and bday cards. So naturally people ask, as a parent, how could you be comfortable with your husband abandoning his kids from his 1st marriage for his 2nd? What does that say about you, that you knew your husband was neglecting his 14 yr old, and that wasn't a \ud83d\udea9 to you?

The daughter doesn't seem to have wanted a relationship with OP. So she had no obligation to this child other than to extend a welcome and to have said yes if she'd wanted to come live with them.\n\nOP said she was willing to have the kid come live with them.

Probably her guardian has been dead for years and she\u2019s in the care of her early-20s sister.\u201d That would have been an absurd series of leaps to make. I think many people tend to assume that someone who is being lied to about something huge will somehow just know\u2014but people often don\u2019t, especially when the lie is really bizarre.\n\nIt\u2019s fair for the stepdaughter to talk publicly about her experience, and I do think the OP should stop asking her to take down her post.

Maybe the daughters flew out for holidays, maybe there were phone calls, we don\u2019t know. We do know that the older daughter knew and has said nothing until now on top of which there are also other family members that had no idea of the situation. I think it was easy enough for the daughters and dad to keep quiet regarding the living situation and many people were left in the dark. \n\nCould OP have asked more questions? Absolutely.

For all we know she was explicitly given semi-believable reasons for none of this to have happened. And when it\u2019s coming from a spouse you trust, even the worst reasons can pass the BS meter.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, she thought she was doing everything she could.

Sometimes when i call her cellphone he'll still answer for her\n\nHe's in his early 30s while my grandparents are getting to their late 60s and the landline is in the kitchen so it makes the most sense for the younger person to get the phone, even if im just visiting and her phone goes off she'll have me answer it for her \n\nAnd my pap just doesn't answer the phone, if he's home alone you have to call atleast twice before he gets up for it", "She isn't just asking, she is expecting the stepdaughter to do it.

I think it's perfectly reasonable to assume that he would tell her if the plan changed and that he is sending them cards and presents. Folk have mobiles and have done for several years. You want to contact someone, you do it direct. You don't need to go via the communal phone anymore. So there's a reason why she wouldn't necessarily be in touch with either Grandma or Daughter. \n\nIt is odd that they didn't seem to visit her in all that time but if they're financially stretched or he goes on his own, it would make sense. \n\nIf you love someone you don't tend to check whether they are lying to you unless they have given you no cause for suspicion.", "Someone found some information.

I don't blame op for not figuring this out/not trying to have a relationship with her step daughter when she assumed that she was respecting her sd's choice to not be a part of the husband's new family.

I\u2019m preparing to be called an asshole for agreeing with the wife on that aspect, those girls were not her responsibility & she trusted her husband, why would she be an asshole for that?", "Right? It makes no sense to me why folks are acting like it's abnormal for her not to have been so involved.", "I met my step dad that my mom was married to about 3 times (when I was 13). He has zero impact on my life as I lived with my dad. \n\nPeople are weird on here.", "Something tells me it'll be a long time before he does that", "Jeez I guess so.", "Yeah no. Fatherhood can be important to a person without them having a 50% custody split. Circumstances are different!\n\nFor ex, my father was very involved in my life and a great dad. I had my issue with him as a teen, but none of them were because he was neglectful or abusive. He did not have 50%  custody of me. My mother had full custody. But they co-parented me and I saw my dad most weekends and did holidays.\n\nWhen I was young my mom got a great, high-level job in another state that was not driving distance away. I went with her. My dad was really sad about not being able to see me all the time, but also knew that he did not have a lifestyle where I could easily live with him and my mom provided the better home for me. You're saying because he didn't fight for 50/50 or to keep me in our home state he didn't see fatherhood as important? Nah.\n\nOP's husband is clearly some kind of manipulator. The story he told her about why the younger daughter didn't come for holidays and such is believable, and it's not a red flag that he agreed to let her live with grandma and saw her on holidays on his own. That's the way it works in some families and is not, in itself, a sign he's not a committed father.\n\nIn fact, not long ago on this sub there was a woman whose ex got full custody of their daughter. The woman had to leave the country due to work visa issues and the daughter didn't want to go somewhere she didn't speak the language and wouldn't be with her existing support system. The mom was sad not to be with the daughter, but also realized it would be in her academic and emotional best interest to stay where she was. That's someone who sees parenthood as important, because it means making the best decisions for your kid even if it'll make you sad.\n\nPerhaps the husband pretended to be sad his daughter didn't want to live with them, but allowed her to stay with grandma for her emotional well being. We see now that's probably not the case, but if that's what he told OP, then I can see her understanding.\n\nAnd again, with stepparents sometimes they are not at all involved in the lives of a partner's existing children. It depends on the family and the situation. It's not some weird thing that she wasn't and didn't question it because, in the end, those are not her children and she had no reason to believe they were being mistreated.\n\nThe husband lied and hid things and manipulated and is 100% to blame. OP is not, because she was lied to.\n\nAgain I ask how it was she was supposed to know that a woman she had no connection to (being the mother of the mother of the daughtera) had died? We don't know that she was connected to the stepdaughters through Facebook at that time. They lived in a different city and most people don't read random obits for fun. Where would she get that information?\n\nIt seems a ton of people had no idea the grandma was dead, but OP was supposed to have known? That makes no sense.", "According to her post and comments, a) she didn't know, and b) more than that, he told her he was going to visit the 14-yr-old.", "And as a legal guardian, the father and step mother are legally obligated to ENSURE the safety of the child. Who the hell believes a 14 year old and doesnt check in on them CONSTANTLY... much less never ask to speak to the grandmother to make sure everything is going well or physically visit.", "She was not a legal guardian that\u2019s one. Two her husband apparently used to go there to visit them multiple times a year. How long was she even in her life she was told she wanted to live with her grandmother not that the dad was sending her away. She was believing her husband not the child whose life she had barley been in."]}
