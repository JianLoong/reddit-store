So I thought. \n\nThe girls stopped getting along as teenagers, so hearing that they had reconnected recently and were even taking trips together was good news. Until last week. 21F posted a picture with 27F apologizing for \"blaming her for the \"situation\" where too much responsibility was put on her\" and thanking her for raising her after their grandmother had passed away **seven** years ago\". \n\nThrough the comments on that post, I found out that the grandmother was not only no longer alive, but had passed soon after the announcement that 21F would be staying with her to finish school. The thread got a lot of attention from our relatives. They're shocked by this, and so am I. \n\nEveryone is assuming that I not only knew about this but approved. I'm getting judgement on all sides. I don't even know how to respond or where to start. I would NEVER have approved of any of this and would have had it out with my husband if I'd even known that he would think of it. I'll admit, I probably could have asked more questions, but I spent the next few years overwhelmed with everything else with all the other kids that I just trusted. I never thought my husband would casually lie about where his kids lived for....I don't even know what reason! To offload them? Start a new life?\n\nRight now, I need to gather information and figure things out, and I'm overwhelmed. I need her to take down the post so I can stop getting bombarded and think for a second. She refuses to take down the post just because I \"can't handle the truth\".

Did y\u2019all never check in with her? You never thought to call the grandmother to ask how she was doing? Never sent her a card?\n\nIn the years right after, I had a hard pregnancy, a baby and then 12F had some major health issues that we were dealing with. Things are settled now, but it was a hard few years and it made it easier to not question when I was told she was busy with school and friends. \n\nHer grandmother wasn't fully fluent, so I never spoke to her.\n\n>response\n\nI've tried that, but it's getting lost in the thread and people don't believe it.", ">When you visited your stepdaughter, didn\u2019t you think to stop by and chat with her grandmother?\n\nShe never visited her because \"she didn't had time\" IN 7 YEARS. Claiming she was too busy with her other children. Why the f do you keep having children if you're not capable to not even care for them, but take ONE single holiday off to visit them?! Or at least make a phone call. Ask her about her life. Ask her how her grandmother is doing. Since she made the public post about her upbringing, she obviously was not keeping this a secret. All you had to do was ask.\n\nOP, you're a terrible mother. Stop making excuses. And for the love of God, stop procreating. You don't need to concieve a child with every partner you marry, if that means you'll be incapable of being a present parent in the life of the kids you already have.\n\nVisiting once in 7 years is the lowest of the low. The bar is burning in hell, and you still couldn't reach it.", "But she\u2019s getting the heat for it even here. How long has she actually been in this girls life. What the girl went through was terrible but she was not having a picnic. This is squarely on the father", "We sent birthday and Christmas gifts, and my husband (supposedly) spent some holidays there some years.", "Already been posted by another commenter", "I'm thinking it's all made up.", "I disagree, of course the husband is an AH, but any woman who marries a father and shows so little interest in his older children for seven years, she is unaware that the 20 year old has become the 14yo's legal guardian is also an AH. In 7 years, she never set eyes on these girls, never had a conversation with them, and never welcomed them into her home??? Never included them in a single family celebration, and now her big concern is that a social media post highlighting the neglect makes her look bad? \n\nThe mother in Flowers in the Attic was more connected to her kids than this.", "I have proof that he knew the grandmother had passed and that he voluntarily gave 27F legal guardianship. \n\nIt's the broader why that I don't know. I'm also curious about certain financial things, but that pales in comparison to the WTF of it all.", ">Also, you probably shouldn't tell the 21 year old to handle her trauma on your time. It's understandable if you wanted to reach out and let her know you were unaware, but don't try and act like a concerned parent figure now.\n\nall of this makes her the AH", "Seven years, and she's never asked why they've never had his daughters in their home??? She hasn't been a \"new stepmother\" for seven years. She is the mother of their sibling, who has never met these half-sisters.", "No, when parents choose to abandon the kids, and NOT be involved, they are the asshole. You don't legally abandon a child and then complain 7 years later that they talk about their tough childhood without parents.", "I still can\u2019t fathom how you and your husband never visited his fourteen year old daughter. You often hear the expression that parenting doesn\u2019t end when the child turns eighteen. Well, it sure as shit doesn\u2019t end when the child is FOURTEEN.", "When you marry someone with children, their children are part of the package deal. You didn't sign over guardianship of your own older kids because you had a hard pregnancy. Obviously you were only too willing to avoid inviting your husband's older children to the house and had absolutely no interest in forging a relationship with them. \n\nI know more about the welfare of distant teenage relatives than you knew about your own teenage stepdaughter. You only seem concerned now because it's embarrassing to you, not because you want to rectify the situation.", "It was probably a hard few years for everyone involved. You keep making excuses for completely losing touch with your step daughters, it's making it look more & more like YTA.", "So you are using the excuse that you were too busy to deal with your stepdaughter. who was a child. Too busy to even make sure that she was safe and in a good environment.  \nWow YTA so is your husband.", "Jfc regardless of what you\u2019re going through she\u2019s your husband\u2019s kid! He should definitely be looking after his own child. You can\u2019t just neglect one because you\u2019re struggling with another. You and (mostly) your husband are horrible. This is just appalling.", "Step parent isn't the same thing as adoptive parent. OP is connected to the girl as her father's spouse; she can't be and many would argue shouldn't try to be more of her parent than her husband is. If she meddled, she'd be accused of meddling most likely and the girls would screech \"you're not my mom butt out\". She can't win.\n\nThe husband is the aashole here. If the genders were reversed, everyone would be outraged by a mother abandoning her child, no one would rain fire on her male partner who had little responsibility, information and input on it anyway. It's cause OP is female that people think she should play mommy to a child above and beyond what dad is doing as a dad.", "So they never met their half-sibling, you never tried to go with your husband, you never had a vacation as a full family? What happened when 21f or 27f graduate from high school/college? You didn't go neither? Why his minor daughter never spend Christmas/Thanksgiving (if you are from the USA) with your family. Where did she spend her summer holidays? \n\nLike I said you were more than happy to not care about them and now it's biting you back  you are playing the victim. \n\nYou may not be as bad as your husband who pawn off his responsibility to his oldest but you are not too far from him. Stop playing the victim and start assuming the fact that you didn't give a fck about them.", "You and your husband obviously could have continued ignoring the girls and easing your conscience by sending gifts without ever inviting them to visit. So the big mystery is why the older daughter struck this deal with her father agreeing that he would relinquish guardianship. That's a really big thing, and you need to ask the older daughter immediately why this happened, because it couldn't have happened without her active participation. \n\nThe only reason I can think is that there is a history of abuse in the family, and she wanted to protect her younger sister. This would also explain why your husband was so secretive about the new arrangement.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your responsibility as such. But it sure as hell is your husband\u2019s. \nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve addressed it already and I\u2019ve missed it,  but I didn\u2019t see anything about their mother. It\u2019s the responsibility of their parents to take care of them, not yours. \n\nI think you are asking strangers on the internet when you should be asking your husband those questions. Where was he in in this? \n\nYTA asking her to take the post down. Why are his relatives \u2018bombarding\u2019 you with messages? They should message your husband.

Shame on both of you.", "I'm sorry OP but you're telling us after your husband married you he never saw his 14 yr old daughter? Sending her birthday presents and Christmas presents was the extent of their contact? Did he introduce his then 14 yr old daughter to her baby sister?\n\nThis means you knew your husband was being an absent deadbeat Dad to his second oldest daughter who was a child. You knew he abandoned her to be raised by her Grandmother without fulfilling 50% of his custody. No telephone calls. No facetime. No visits. You were there. When he chose to ignore his other children while being hands on with the daughter you created together and your kids you brought into the marriage, you were there. You never questioned why the 14 yr old child never met your youngest. You never questioned why your husband never visited his second oldest child. \n\nThe Grandma dying is almost irrelevant. Your issue isn't that your Husband to abandon his other family for your family. Your issue is your husband didn't get his minor child an alive guardian. And due to this you can't maintain your cognitive dissonance of, *my husband hasn't abandon his kids, they preferred their Grandma* , which is something you could tell your family, friends and society. You're faced with the truth. Your husband is capable of abandoning his kids when their presence doesn't suit him, you went along with it because it suited you, now everyone knows you both abandoned these kids to the extent you didn't know her guardian had passed away before your husband awarded her guardianship.", "When he unceremoniously ditches you and goes no-contact with all your kids as soon as he finds a younger and prettier wife to start his next family, I imagine you'll still be sitting there scratching your head at the WTF of it all, eh?", "Wow it seems to have taken you almost no time and very little effort to get proof that grandma did die and that your husband signed over guardianship of one of his children to another one of his children... \n\nAnd yet somehow in the past seven years not a single moment could have been spared to ever even inquire after WHERE THE HECK THE 14 YO WAS! \n\nYou have a 14 y.o. now .. you telling me you don't see that kid for seven years you're not asking a single question in 7 years?", "You'd better start talking to your family and friends about your plans for your children's welfare if anything happens to you. If your husband can abandon one 14 year old, do you think he's going to be there for your kids?", "Instead of demanding her to take down a post exposing the truth, why didn't you privately contact her & have a conversation? You could have apologized for everything that happened while also making it clear that you were unaware about everything & are horrified by your husband's actions. \n\nYTA for asking her to take down the post. If you need time & quiet to think then silence your notifications until you've sorted things out. 21 didn't hide these things from you. Get answers by all means, but don't put it on her for what the adults chose to do during these 7 years.", "Ultimately you\u2019ll need husband to come clean.

I couldn't get the time between work and visitation with my bios to go with.", "I DID invite them. Not only to visit but to live with us. \n\nI thought we were involved.

This whole story and all the people in it (except for the poor daughters) are just nauseating.", "She trusted her husband for God's sakes!", "This!  OP would be the asshole if she asked her sd to take the post down, but she is not responsible for her husband's lies and shitty parenting.", "They can both be AHs and are.", "If this was all done legally, husband would have probably had to pay the older daughter child support or some sort of maintenance. Or would have paid it to the grandmother, and when she died it was then transferred to the daughter. OP mentions some financial irregularities in one of her comments, it's probably just the money he had to pay to keep his abandoned kids alive while he played happy families with OP.", "I got that through the comment thread. I couldn't believe it, so I was arguing back at first and she posted the proof.", "Then ride your husband about his lies and irresponsibility. Your step-daughter DID go thru a crap situation and she has every right to post about it.\n\nIf people are riding you and saying you were at fault (and I do think a wee bit of it is on you as a step-parent) the majority of this lies at the feet of your dead-beat dad of a husband.", "She was 14. Just a bit older than your child. Would you expect to only visit your child \na handful of times? Being busy is a shit excuse. Your husband is disgusting but you did not care enough to notice.", "You didn't have a single day off in 7 years?  I find that very, very hard to believe.  It was more like out of sight, out of mind for you, wasn't it?  Take the lumps you deserve, and apologize.  It's the least you can do after what the girls had to endure.", "Unlike others, I have empathy for you. You are not without blame but your mind must be in chaos. Don\u2019t ask 21F to take down the post, don\u2019t respond to others\u2026block them if possible. Identify what happened. Contact a lawyer to understand your position.

This isn't just one Christmas, we're talking seven years where you never set eyes on them and never had a long enough conversation to find out their grandmother died or their living arrangements had drastically changed and your husband wasn't the legal guardian any more. \n\nHow can you say you thought you were involved? I find it really difficult to believe the girls were acting as if everything was fine and Grandma was fine for seven whole years, while you were putting in all these sterling efforts to \"encourage a relationship\".\n\nI think you've really opened Pandora's box here, and you are going to discover a lot of family secrets, starting with the fact that your husband is extremely untrustworthy and a terrible father. But you need to talk to your older stepdaughter about why she thought this was the right option, because she could easily have refused to be single mother of a teenager at the age of 20, so there must have been a serious reason why she chose to do this.", "Every christmas, you didn't think about her? Every birthday, you didn't think about her? Your excuses are BS.

Or arrange to see them when your older children were with their father?  You say that you were busy with the other children but your family has five children, it\u2019s not like you were juggling a Duggar-level of kids.
