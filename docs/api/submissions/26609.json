Melissa has a daughter, Sara (25). \n\nI didn\u2019t live with my dad full time growing up. My parents had shared custody but it was pretty flexible, so I\u2019d spend on average 2 nights there a week and my dad would normally take me to dinner one evening a week. I have never had much of a relationship with Melissa but we\u2019ve always been friendly. \n\nSara, on the other hand, has always been jealous of me and my relationship with my dad. Anything I was doing, she wanted to do, anywhere I was going with my dad, she wanted to come. My dad always handled it, but I was always aware that she was clearly unhappy when I was around. My dad and I spoke about this more than once, and my dad expressed that he found Sara always expecting things from him a bit stressful and that he had brought it up with Melissa but it didn\u2019t seem to help. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen Sara much in the last few years since I moved away, but I recently got engaged so my fianc\u00e9 and I had dinner with my dad, Melissa, Sara, and her fianc\u00e9 to celebrate. My dad made a toast, and said he\u2019d like to pay for the wedding. He then presented us with a cheque. I thanked him, but said we will be paying for the wedding ourselves. My dad said he wanted to contribute to our lives in some way, and my fianc\u00e9 suggested we could put the money into a trust for our future child. We then continued on with the dinner.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from Sara, who said I should split the money my dad gave me for the wedding with her. I was confused and asked why, and Sara said that my dad is a father figure to both of us. I told her if my dad wanted to give her money he would have and that it has nothing to do with me. Sara started getting mad and said that I should share the money since I didn\u2019t need it. She swore at me, called me mean, spoilt, a gold digger, all sorts. Then she said it was my fault she never had a dad and I need to share the money and admit my dad is her dad, too. I was just getting so annoyed and said, \u201cit\u2019s not my fault he doesn\u2019t love you, if you want money from him, ask him\u201d and hung up on her.\n\nI guess he did ask him, because my dad called and got mad at me for blowing up on her, saying I didn\u2019t have to be that harsh with her. He said it\u2019s caused a lot of drama between him and Melissa and Sara. He said I didn\u2019t have to respond to Sara\u2019s goading, and maybe that\u2019s true but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH for saying what he was too scared to, especially when I was being blamed for something that has nothing to do with me.", "created_utc": 1694374710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f9fx1/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_its_not_my_fault/", "score": 1207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

IDK where Sara's father is or if he's alive or in her life, but it was never realistic on her part to expect your father to take his place, and that should have been made clear to her from the beginning, maybe she should have been in therapy or something.", "Honestly your dad is the AH for making a big deal of presenting you with a check in front of everyone. That was a total set up for you and Sara given your history and a very self-aggrandizing way to go about what is otherwise a lovely and generous gesture. \n\nAs between you and Sara, I guess I\u2019d say  you\u2019re NTA only because she was so far out line that I can understand why you pushed back. But it was still a really cruel thing to say.", "NTA. Sara obviously has tons of issues and she needs to talk them through with your dad. The money was obviously just a means to an end for her to take her frustrations out on you but you owe her nothing. Your dad and stepmom are assholes though for not handling this situation better.", "NTA- Your father\u2019s relationship with his stepdaughter is not something that should affect you. She was being extremely cruel TO YOU, so YOU told her off. Even politely asking to split the money is inappropriate. The fact that she was cruel about it is extremely bad. \n\nI kind of feel bad that she don\u2019t have a good father figure, but that\u2019s something she needs to discuss with your father. It\u2019s not any of your concern.", "The AH in this story is your dad- your dad obviously never stepped into the father role for Sara and she has seen the difference between how he treats you and how he treats her.  Also, if he never intended to give money towards her wedding, it was a low blow to announce in front of her and her fianc\u00e9 that he wanted to pay for your entire wedding.  He could have told you that away from her, not throw it in her face.  You\u2019re NTA but I would have a discussion with your dad", "You\u2019re fine. Your dad is a bit of an insensitive dick though.", "NTA, but why the hell did he give it to you in front of her?? That was idiotic. He caused this, not you.", "NTA\n\nSara has a lot of issues that her mother should have dealt with eons ago, namely in therapy. Your father should have discussed the situation with his wife from the start, instead of venting to you over the years. He knows how she is, but he chose to give you a check in front of her? What the hell was he thinking? Now he has to face 13+ years\u2019 worth of accumulated drama he swept under the rug. It\u2019s his fault he let the situation fester into the mess it\u2019s become. He should not be blaming you. \n\nYou\u2019re his biological daughter. Where\u2019s Sara\u2019s father?  It\u2019s fine she thinks of your dad as a father-figure, but that doesn\u2019t mean it extends to his wallet. Her expecting everything that you get and then getting jealous of you is absurd. Has her mother intervened, or is she stirring the pot, too? You had no choice but deal with Sara head on- someone had to. When someone is rude, uncivilized and accusatory, they have no right to expect courtesy. She blatantly targeted you. You owe her nothing.", "Your dad is the AH in this situation. He KNEW that such a public display of favoritism would cause a problem and he did it anyway. He knows Sara sees him as a parental figure. He comes across as mean spirited. \n\nAnd as someone who has a husband who has been a stepdad for 23 years, I would be livid if he did something like this. \n\nYou are NTA for the display. You are an AH for your words. It seems you learned some things from your father.", "Your dad is the AH--and a huge one.  \n\nIt was totally inappropriate and cruel for him to tell you that Sara always expected things from him and that that was stressful.  He CHOSE to be a step-parent.  By telling you that, he was playing you and Sara off against each other.  \n\nIt seems like she has always been chasing him to get attention from someone who should have been a father figure to her and he has not only rejected her but driven a wedge between you and her by making it obvious he had time for you but not her.\n\nAnd it is absolutely shocking that your father made an announcement about money in front of her.  How does an adult with a daughter old enough to be getting married lack basic manners? \n\nSara's attitude right now about the money is unreasonable.  Her own father should give her money and if he is not around, your father and her mother should do their best for her.  She is their step-child.\n\nThat said, she has good reason to be angry and I'd bet a lot of her attitude about the money comes from having been rejected for so long.  Think about it.  You got all of your father's time, good-will, and attention and now you're getting money.  He SIGNED UP to be a parent to Sara and she has had her nose rubbed in your father's much better treatment of you for most of her life.", "INFO: Where is Sara\u2019s dad?  Has he ever been a meaningful presence in her life?  Without excusing Sara\u2019s behavior, it sounds like she was desperate for a positive father figure growing up and wanted your father to be that for her, but he always held her at arms length.  That had to hurt her terribly.\n\nI am also a bit skeptical that you have accurately conveyed everything you said to Sara in that call given that your father, who by your account always found Sara annoying and resented her expectations of him, would be taking Sara\u2019s side here unless you said something that really crossed a line.", "NTA your dad made a grand gesture to one child and expected the other not to react? He is in a problem of his own making. Could you have been nicer? Sure. But who rings someone and asks for half the money they were just gifted? In what strange place in her head does that equate love from your dad. \n\nYour stepsister needs to seek medical help as she is suffering some sense of loss or a void. And I don't think  your father helps at all, he should have made an effort to develop some kind of relationship with her even if it was not the same as your own, but something that made her feel more secure in the man her mother married. He should have made an effort", "You were wrong in the way you said it, but not wrong in what you said.  Your father's relationship with your stepsister has nothing to do with you.  They need to figure it out on their own, but you could have been kinder on how said that to her.  I'm just going to go with ESH becausd all of you are in the wrong in one way or another.", "The irony of her calling you a gold digger whilst having her hand out, begging for money. NTA", "NTA, but your Dad was an idiot for giving you a check in front of everyone.  He needs to learn some fucking discretion.", "So your dad has been Sara's dad since she was 12 years old.\n\n>Sara\u2019s dad was an inconsistent presence in her life,\n\nSo she lived with your father full time and he was the only consistent male role model in her life?\n\nYou're NTA.\n\nBut your dad sure is an asshole. Sounds like he married a woman with a 12 year old daughter while never intending to be a parent to her. \n\nCome to think of it, Melissa is also an asshole for staying married to a man who treated her daughter this way.", "NTA , you are not responsible for how your father acts or his feelings for his stepdaughter. It is not your job to improve that , the sole person responsible to influence or improve that relationship was the mother . It is clear that it was not in her interest to do it . She never noticed that her husband did not feel like a father to her daughter . It is what it is , her father gave her money she did not ask for , she does not have to split it with someone she does not know well. Sara should be respectful of her stepsister\u2019s relationship with her biological father and not try to make her feel guilty for something she has no control . Stepmom is the AH for noticing her daughter did not have a loving father figure.", "NTA. Calling it like you see it.

He and her mom should have sought family counseling if they knew that there was a disconnect between Sara and him (and that he was the one who didn't feel the connection).\n3. Sara was an ahole to ask you to share your money. But, man she's hurting! She was a 12 yo who couldn't get parental love from one of the parent figures in her home. That hurt little 12 yo is still hurting. Yeah, she's 25 now, but she still gets reminded that she's not loved by her stepdad. Can't you get that?!\n4. You are a bit of an ahole to not have seen that in all these years. I don't expect you to have understood when you were 11 or 12. I also get that you weren't there full time, and you have been influenced by your dad's attitude over the years. But you are old enough to be able see and hear and think for yourself. Not saying you had to share the monetary gift you were given, but I sure hope you can develop some compassion for how horrible this has been for Sara and comprehend why it's not her fault.\n5. Your stepmom is also an ahole. She brought into her daughter's life a man who was cold and distant and not a loving parent, She tolerated it.

How did he think it would play out??", "Maybe, but Sara clearly bet the farm on this relationship and is now annoyed it isn't the perfect father-daughter dynamic she wanted, which is no one's fault but her own expectations and wish for money. Assuming she was 11 or 12 when op's dad came into the picture, honestly I'm not sure it's reasonable to assume he would immediately slot into the role as Sara's dad, undoubtedly hurt by her expectation, and made more complicated due that we don't know what the situation with Sara's dad is.\n\nRegardless she is an adult now and isn't entitled to his money.\n\nEdit: op says that Sara's real dad was in her life, if inconsistently, so I don't see why op's dad would be expected to fill a role that is already filled.", "I mean let him that what he did was wrong.

It is more normal to be full on parents than what your dad has done.", "Well, you don't need anything from your stepfather because you have a father who can help you!  Also, if your mother and stepfather have joint finances and she gave you money, it would have come from him whether he acknowledged it or not.\n\nI have dual citizenship and it is not true that the expectation is different for step-parents in the UK.  Good try!  You really seem to be having a hard time with acknowledging how awful and unfair life in your family has obviously been for Sara.  Think about it.  It might come as a shock to hear it, but think it over.\n\nThe situation in the UK is that fathers are rarely forced to pay adequate child support and until recently, it was possible for the kids to survive on benefits their mothers received.  Also, until pretty recently, kids didn't have to pay university tuition or not much and it was possible for kids who had no parental support to build decent lives and careers.  What all of this adds up to is that there isn't as much pressure in the UK for fathers to have to support their kids.  But these days, kids who don't have parental financial support have a much harder time.\n\nYour father CHOSE to take on a parental role and then neglected it.  If his finances are still so separate from Sara's mother's at this point that \"he\" can give you money (as opposed to \"they\"), then that's odd.  It sounds like there are people living in two different worlds in your family.  \n\nYou seem to have been totally oblivious to all this and now it's time to grow up and find some understanding and compassion for why the current situation is happening.  I'd feel very uncomfortable about it if I were you.  Good luck", "Tell him that HE caused the drama. He would have this situation if he hadn't make a scene with giving you a cheque, especially since he knew well how needy she was.\n\nAnd let's be honest, Sara is not mad that you told her what you tald her. She is mad because her father figure is treating her like she is not related to him. And Melissa is not angry at him because Sara is upset, but because he is treating Sara like he doesn't care about her. And your father would rather selfishly prefer that Sara directed her emotions at you then to deal with his own mess.\n\nHe is the center of the drama, but acting like a random passerby dragged into this unwillingly", "That\u2019s what you told your sister. And obviously your dad rubbed it in her face.  But it did she was wrong asking you for all that but you literally said to her it\u2019s not my fault he loves me more.

Strippers get money thrown at them everyday it doesn\u2019t mean the men love them more", "Sure, if Sara had asked a leading question that led to the response, \u201cit\u2019s not my fault he doesn\u2019t love you.\u201d But she didn\u2019t, she was whining, cajoling and begging for money. I\u2019m not saying Sara isn\u2019t an asshole, but the OP doesn\u2019t have to be the bigger asshole to get her to back off, she can hang up and screen her calls.

I knew my dad would probably offer because he\u2019s traditional like that. \n\nOkay well I don\u2019t know the whole of the uk, but in my own experiences of divorced parents between my own, my other step siblings, and my friends, that\u2019s the case. \n\nI don\u2019t feel uncomfortable.

I cannot imagine any of them telling a kid that she's the most important one and the step-kid is annoying.  That is shocking.\n\nYou don't feel uncomfortable because you're the golden child who has had it all.  You have never had to think about what it's like to be the disadvantaged person.

What was the point of him marrying this woman if he never cared to include her daughter or treat her as part of the family?", "There\u2019s no such thing as separate finances in marriage.  Legally maybe, but morally no.  Sarah is being badly treated and some day you may realize that", "Uh, I think that I've learned from this very subreddit that stepkids absolutely have the right to expect that of their stepparents.  It's the other way around that's usually the problem.  If you're not going to love the stepchild like they're your full child, don't marry their mom.", "That's not a fair take. We don't know if the Dad did take Sara out other times when OP wasn't around.

Sometimes the parents don't want the stepparents to act as parents, sometimes the kids want to see the stepparent as a parent, sometimes they don't, and vice versa. A lot depends on age, whether there is another parent in the picture.  Deciding what is equitable is very difficult.  \n\nThere have been cases where one child has two natural parents who have more money, and they get a car.  A step-sibling may not have two parents, or they might not have as much money.  So do the parents deny one child a car, or does the step-parent and their ex have to buy a car for the stepchild or for all their stepchildren?  \n\nIs the stepchild to inherit from their step-parent's family?  In that case, do their step-siblings inherit from the family of the stepchild's other parent?\n\nOne man had saved a lot of money, from a settlement for a work accident as well as an inheritance.  His ex demanded that he share with her two step-children and her additional bio-children.  What does he owe them for being related to his children, but not to him?", "Full children aren't entitled to large checks from their parents either. Plus, unless op said in a comment I didn't see, we don\u2019t know if dad offered to pay for Sara's wedding or not.", "Kinda yes because based on this subreddit too, the dynamics of blended families can be quite confusing, but that's an issue for OP's father, stepsis, and her mom to resolve, not OP's.

I just don't blame her for feeling excluded if he always \"handled it\" when she wanted to join in and was never allowed to.", "I'm not sure the check is the real problem.

Still doesn't make him an AH. \n\nWe also don't know what role Melissa, Sara's mother, wanted him to play with Sara, since Sara had a Biodad she saw intermittently.  Melissa could have not wanted him to have a fatherly role at all. \n\nOP wouldn't know. Nor would it be any of her business. \n\nSaras father died 2 years ago.

Because she\u2019s a human being who\u2019s being mistreated right in front of you, and because you\u2019re being used as a weapon in that maltreatment? She has every reason to expect some love from your dad: he joined her family, you do not marry someone with kids unless you\u2019re going to love their kids and treat them as part of the family. The kid doesn\u2019t need to love the stepparent \u2014 they\u2019re a kid \u2014 but the stepparent has an obligation to at least not contribute to the hurt feelings of the stepchild.\n\n\u201cDad, I appreciate the gift, but I\u2019m really uncomfortable with you presenting it in front of your stepdaughter when you *know* how much it hurts her that you don\u2019t treat her like a daughter.

You\u2019re being used as a weapon to really show her what she\u2019ll never have, which means you\u2019re already in the middle of it; regardless of who or what she is/isn\u2019t to you, you have an obligation to at least put a stop to your part in it.", "Save yourself.
