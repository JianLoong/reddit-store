Why is it douchey of you not to pay for her food?  She was going to be owing for her meal regardless.  Whether the owner of the place comped yours or not, that's not the issue. She still ate the food, you just got lucky and got a free meal.  \n\nYou stated that you usually both pay for your own...why is this situation different?  Sounds to me like she was a little miffed that you got the attention for once.  How dare you?! /s  What did you do to embarrass her?  Again, where did this hurt her or change her circumstance?  I think her pride took a jab and she's lashing out at you.", "NTA your friend is jealous you got attention. It may be time to reevaluate whether she is really your friend or uses being with you as an ego boost as long as she is the \"hot one.\"", "NTA\n\nShe didn't even give you a chance to say anything. She literally demanded money from you because she was butt hurt that the guy was laying attention to you and not her. Also when she's gotten free stuff she never has offered to cover your bill either. ( OP commented thus relevant info)\n\nThat makes her an ahole....not you OP. I bet she never wants to eat at that place again lol.", "NTA\n\nFriend was jealous that you got attention and she didn't.  So instead of her keeping the agreement she got greedy.", "INFO: I'm wondering if there have ever been times where the two of you have gone out and she's received freebies where she didn't offer to pay half of your tab?", "NTA. She demanded as soon as the bill came. Heck no. Give you a moment to offer or kindly ask.\n\nReally does sound like she's just mad you got a free meal and got hit on.\n\nAnd if the roles where reversed? She'd laugh in your face and tell you no.", "NTA but she is. She ordered her food and drinks knowing that she would be responsible for her separate bill. I\u2019m with you as well, I would have offered to split her tab if mine had been comped. However, if the roles were reversed, I would never ask - much less demand you to offer the same favor.", "This is an interesting situation, because if you've never split the bill before then I don't see why you should split it now just because your meal was free. I've read your comments about your friend receiving free drinks and not sharing with you or offering to split the costs of your drinks.

A good friend would think it was cool you got a free meal and nice attention (as long as it is nice attention and not the creepy kind) instead of narcissistically complaining about how they didn't. It could have been a fun story to tell other friends about but now instead of it being the time you got a free meal for being hot, it's the time your friend got jealous that you where the hot one instead of her.", "NTA. Your friend sound petty and jealous. If she had just kept her mouth shut for 30 seconds but no.

The worst thing is when someone is willing to give something to something *out of their own volition and the goodness of their heart* but the other person starts to demand the gift before you have the chance to give it.

And if BF wasn't so greedy, she would have got it split, because you are a good friend.\n\nBut in the end, you aren't required to split because you both pay your own bills.  So she never had the expectation of it being split.  Plus if you did have that expectation normally, she would have been planning to pay 10-15 dollars more for that evening's meal.  \n\nAnd also how are you embarrassing her?  By getting hit on by the owner(when she didn't?). Or because she made such a public fuss about you paying for HER bill?  I only see her embarrassing herself as presented.  \n\nSo unless you were shouting for the entire restaurant to hear, *HA HA, he liked me better than you, nanna nanna boo boo.*  I don't think you were petty either.   \n\nYou also offered to pay the entire tip so she saved 10-20 dollars right there depending on what you guys tend to tip.\n\nThis isn't BFF behavior, so you may be reaching the end of the road with her if this is an example rather than exception to her treatment of you.", "NTA\n\nYou said in the comments she's never split the bill with you when she's got free stuff.

But I wonder why being offered a free meal was considered \"douchy.\"As you write, such gratuitous treatment doesn't occur to you every day because you're not the \"hot\" one. As you didn't ask for a free meal, I don't see what the problem is. Your best friend was not a part of the offer. Sorry for her being left out, but there it is. She was still left with paying her portion of the bill, which she would have done in any case.  It's a non-event. Was she embarrassed because she was overlooked and not looked over? Hopefully, you two can get past this one-time turn of events. It would be a shame to lose a friendship over $75 but that would be your friend's choice, not yours.", "NTA - she was expecting to pay for her entire meal anyway when she sat down.

What does you getting your meal comped have to do with her bill?", "YTA. It\u2019s the polite thing to do when in that situation.

The guy flirted and offered to cover your meal. You aren\u2019t then obligated to cover hers because her feelings are hurt. If the situation were reversed would she pay half your meal?
