Why is it douchey of you not to pay for her food?  She was going to be owing for her meal regardless.  Whether the owner of the place comped yours or not, that's not the issue. She still ate the food, you just got lucky and got a free meal.  \n\nYou stated that you usually both pay for your own...why is this situation different?  Sounds to me like she was a little miffed that you got the attention for once.  How dare you?! /s  What did you do to embarrass her?  Again, where did this hurt her or change her circumstance?  I think her pride took a jab and she's lashing out at you.", "NTA your friend is jealous you got attention. It may be time to reevaluate whether she is really your friend or uses being with you as an ego boost as long as she is the \"hot one.\"", "NTA\n\nShe didn't even give you a chance to say anything. She literally demanded money from you because she was butt hurt that the guy was laying attention to you and not her. Also when she's gotten free stuff she never has offered to cover your bill either. ( OP commented thus relevant info)\n\nThat makes her an ahole....not you OP. I bet she never wants to eat at that place again lol.", "NTA\n\nFriend was jealous that you got attention and she didn't.  So instead of her keeping the agreement she got greedy.", "INFO: I'm wondering if there have ever been times where the two of you have gone out and she's received freebies where she didn't offer to pay half of your tab?", "NTA. She demanded as soon as the bill came. Heck no. Give you a moment to offer or kindly ask.\n\nReally does sound like she's just mad you got a free meal and got hit on.\n\nAnd if the roles where reversed? She'd laugh in your face and tell you no.", "NTA but she is. She ordered her food and drinks knowing that she would be responsible for her separate bill. I\u2019m with you as well, I would have offered to split her tab if mine had been comped. However, if the roles were reversed, I would never ask - much less demand you to offer the same favor.", "This is an interesting situation, because if you've never split the bill before then I don't see why you should split it now just because your meal was free. I've read your comments about your friend receiving free drinks and not sharing with you or offering to split the costs of your drinks. It's unfair of her to expect you to share the perks of a guy taking interest in you when she doesn't do the same. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA, especially considering the friend didn\u2019t split the bill multiple times when she got free drinks", "NTA. A good friend would think it was cool you got a free meal and nice attention (as long as it is nice attention and not the creepy kind) instead of narcissistically complaining about how they didn't. It could have been a fun story to tell other friends about but now instead of it being the time you got a free meal for being hot, it's the time your friend got jealous that you where the hot one instead of her.", "NTA. Your friend sound petty and jealous. If she had just kept her mouth shut for 30 seconds but no. You\u2019ve put yourself down physically and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably not being objective. but looks don\u2019t last forever and your friends personality is clearly not very attractive and yours is!", "Info: has she ever had her meal comped and then offered to split your bill? I assume it\u2019s happened since she\u2019s \u201cthe \u2018hot one\u2019\u201d.", "NTA. At least you offered to pay the tip.  She shouldn't expect you to pay half her bill if you guys have never split the bills that way before.", "Nta", "Nta at all your meal was free not hers", "NTA. The worst thing is when someone is willing to give something to something *out of their own volition and the goodness of their heart* but the other person starts to demand the gift before you have the chance to give it. It's entitled, rude behaviour. It's a *gift*, not a *requirement*. \n\nI would have changed my mind as well", "I hate to say this OP, but I think your friend is used to having you around as the 'ugly friend' to direct attention to her. I had a friend who put me in the same position and it took a similar situation of me getting attention when she didn't for me to realise what was going on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA on the bill splitting issue, but seriously look back on various interaction with her and see if she has been putting you in that position all along.", "INFO- why would the owner show interest in you and give you a free meal?", "YTA for not sharing the goodwill gesture with your friend\n\nEdit: I don't think she should have demanded anything but if you'd budgeted for a meal out and then got it for free unexpectedly then the generous thing to do is share that perk with the other person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It wasn't your fault your meal was free, and she isn't entitled to you paying half of her meal because of something outside of your power.", "NTA She is very immature. I wonder if she would have paid for half of yours.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned in comments she often gets free drinks and never offers to cover you.", "NTA and you did good offering to pay for the tip because that\u2019s really all you owed at that point. she\u2019s just jealous someone gave you attention.", "NTA.", "NTA. You don't react this way when she gets attention right? She's being immature.", "NTA Why should you pay for her meal even partways? Everybody pays for his food, your meal was paid by the owner, what difference does it make if you pay your meal, or the owner? Oh yes, she was pissed that you got the attention this time and not her.Ask yourself if she is really a friend or use you to feel better.", "NTA and it wasn\u2019t a douchey move on yours or the guys part. He\u2019s interested in your and was flirting. Your friend just isn\u2019t used to guys not being into her. How often does her stuff get paid for by guys and yours doesn\u2019t? She needs to buy a clue. Looks aren\u2019t everything and her ugliness inside showed exactly why the guy preferred you to her.\n\nSoooo are you going to go out with him? See him again? Interested in him? Spill the tea and give us an update! I\u2019m a softy over here!", "This is hilarious! No, NTA at all! She was just straight up mad and jealous that you were the one getting attention this time! \n\nIf this is how she acts when that happens, I wouldn't be friends with her anymore! She sounds awful!", "NTA. Not your food. Not your bill.", "ESH, because it would've been polite to pay the tip. Even just half. You were right not to want to pay half your friend's food, though", "NTA. You never split your meals yet you were willing to make an exception this time. However the fact that she almost demanded splitting the bill before you were able to even suggest it is enough for you not to do it. She has to understand that she\u2019s not entitled to anything.", "It seems you have some jealousy to deal with  \n\n\nWhen he said your food was free you should have said in good gesture that you would still help pay the bill. It is a hard line yet she is your friend so yes YTA", "I think this is the core of it. The friend is really not used to not being the hot one and not being the chased one.

Anyway we stroke up a conversation while waiting for the table.

She didn\u2019t owe her anything, she didn\u2019t have to do it at all yet was going to till her friend became rude.

Did he tell you to order more? I\u2019m guessing this is what your friend was left with the 75$ bill.", "I\u2019m saying *usually* the whole bill, a desert, or appetizer is comped. Not just one person\u2019s meal.", "Sounds like SHE got jealous of YOU", "You said she has been given free drinks, did she also share them with you?  \n\n\nI have been a bartender for many years and seen friends enjoy nights out by sharing the perks they are given, especially if one gets more attention.", "No she has never done that.

Like 3-4 times I explained both in the post and comments. I even explained why we ask for separate bills. I don\u2019t know what more I need to be explaining.
