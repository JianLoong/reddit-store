This has been quite a shock to most people as they seemed to be having to issues out of the ordinary. However, I have been the one privy to the information of why they are divorcing.\n\nIt's because of my sister \"Anne\" (26 F). Anne is a deadbeat. She has never worked more than 14 hours a week since getting expelled from college for multiple acts of cheating and code of conduct violations 5 years ago. All she does is sit at home most days watching TV or going over to her loser boyfriend's house to get high. She feels no need to support herself and expects my parents to carry her through life. She's been in therapy since she was 14 but cannot keep one for more than a year because she gets dropped as a client due to her lying and inability to show up to appointments. My parents have spent over a decade trying to get some mental issue pinned down for Anne and all they've gotten is she's just a lazy narcissist.\n\nLast year my Mom decided enough was enough and planned to kick Anne to the curb and wash her hands of her. Dad disagreed, and in the end, the two's marriage got torn apart. I know because both have come to me basically admitting that if Anne was not a factor divorce would not even be a consideration. \n\nI don't get along with Anne for a variety of reasons. She has always been a bully and owes me a large sum of money at the moment. The thing that boils my blood though is that she's oblivious to the situation between our parents, or just doesn't care. She had a literal tantrum when the possibility of the house being sold came up because she didn't want to have to move to an apartment with my dad. \n\nLast night I found myself at my parent's house and had the misfortune of talking to Anne. Anne mentioned that she's getting really sick of my mom's \"melodramatic shit\" and not just leaving the house to her and my dad. Something struck me at that moment and I just asked Anne if she really does not care that she's such a selfish, garbage, waste of space human that she's driven her parents to get a divorce. I elaborated, and told her the full truth that she is in fact the only reason they are getting a divorce because mom's finally realized that there is no hope Anne will ever grow up.\n\nThe shitstorm this caused was massive. Anne acted as if I sold her out to the Romans and my parents argued between \"she deserves to know\" and \"we told you that in confidence.\" Because Anne cannot keep her mouth shut either, the entire extended family has begun to hear too. I want to know before opinions start forming outside the inner circle if I am the asshole here.", "created_utc": 1678975079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11suxep/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_the_reason_our/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have slight reservations because therapy started quite young.

And I get where your mom is coming from clearly pushing your sister out on her ass and forcing her to grow up is the only solution left that has hope. I can see where this caused their split but yeah your sister needed to know. Your extended family\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t really matter either if they aren\u2019t stepping in with solutions they don\u2019t matter.

Anne's behavior is atrocious, but you broke your parents' trust. \n\nAlso, this doesn't make you the AH, but I think you should consider that while the way you let loose on her was understandable because you just couldn't take it anymore, the level of rancor you expressed and the nastiness of your language were likely unhelpful. All that kind of language does is put someone on the defensive and make them dig into their position more. There's a saying in acceptance and commitment therapy: it doesn't matter if something is true; it matters if it's helpful. This may have made the situation even worse for your dad. I think you and your parents should work with a therapist to figure out the best way to give her the push she needs.", "ESH\n\nyou said the ONE THING you are just not allowed to say. ofc Anne sucks here too if what you say is the truth", "ESH including the parents  \nAnne for obvious reasons, you because it's not your place to try to parent her and your parents because they haven't sorted this out between them and Anne long ago  \nYou say that Anne is the reason they're divorcing like they are victims to an unstoppable act of god, but they have left this to go on for 26 years.    \nIf I read your post correctly your mother has wanted to take a firm stance with Anne and your father says he agrees but when it comes down to it doesn't want to or isn't capable of holding fast to this.   \nYour mother is getting a divorce from Anne and the only way to do it is divorcing your father, sure Anne is the topic, she showed them they were incompatible and unable to parent together. Ultimately it sounds like your father chose coddling Anne over keeping his marriage.    \nWithout Anne they probably would have hobbled along, but the problem would just have not been visible.", "NTA how long would it have taken for them to tell her the truth? By then she'd probably ruin her and her mother's relationship by thinking she's selfish and would continue to be the waste of space she is to her dad and eventually he'll get sick of her, better now then never especially when it's something as serious as this.", "NTA.

Each of them decided they would rather not be married anymore than compromise on this. Regardless of which of your parents is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d on that, they should be owning the decision to divorce rather than shifting the blame to Anne.", "ESH\n\nYour parents for blaming someone else for them not tackling this issue as a united front.  Its is easy to blame someone else for a failed marriage, they suck for not taking ownership of their own bullshit.  Sis because she just sucks ass.  You for adding drama to the dumpster fire & thinking it was for someone's? best interest.", "NTA. She ruined lives", "ESH. Even though she might've needed to hear it, it just started a whole other pile of drama you guys gotta deal with.", "NTA: Your sister sounds exactly like a narcissist and likely will never be able to learn or deal with that fact. Your father has chosen to enable her and that it's a deal breaker for mom. Your sister has refused to even take therapy seriously and has used her narcissistic traits to attempt to manipulate the therapists. That could be a big reason as to why she keeps getting dropped as a client. I have seen that happen in my mental health workplace. She likely will never ever change. Pathological narcissists are incapable of doing so even in an inpatient clinical setting. The best they can do is be made aware of their tendencies and behaviors and will only course correct if they realize that it's in their best interest but that's so rare of a case that my clinical department director has only seen a pathological narc change behavior once in his 30 year career that was beneficial to his loved ones and not only the narc.", "This sub has an irrational hatred for anyone who is a NEET, lost their job, down on their luck, lives with parents/partner's parents, or can't afford rent.\n\nSo you are 100% gonna get a NTA judgement even if your sister is alright.\n\nHowever, assuming everything you've said is true, then you are NTA and your sister is a huge AH.\n\nMy wife's parents actually have a similar issue with their youngest son, and it's caused rifts precisely because my MIL wants to kick him out after he was nasty to her while my FIL doesn't. But nothing close to the level of a divorce.", "NTA Anne needed this reality check.", "NTA.", "Probably an unpopular opinion, but YTA\n\n Though this is the rare instance where it's actually true that she caused, or was at least a major factor in, the divorce. Being told you caused your parents divorce is not something anyone would react well to. Her general behavior is an issue, but I cannot blame her for reacting badly in this instance, despite the truth of the accusation. \n\nYour parents also deserve a mention for letting it get this far, your dad's enabling in particular. \n\nNow onto why I went YTA instead of E S H, which would have been perfectly justified. You were told that in confidence, and you broke that trust. Telling her served no purpose but to create drama, since she is unlikely to change; nor do I see any intent from you to encourage change by telling her. You broke confidence and created drama for nothing but your personal, momentary satisfaction. So while in the background your sister and father definitely suck, your mother possibly does and your fine, for this specific incident you do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The second one was that they said it was wrong of you to tell her. \n\nAbout your Sister... She is indeed a special case...

I think what she did was overall wrong and I cant understand her even in the smallest bit... \n\nTelling her wasnt the right way, not diplomatic or very nice.

They deserve to enjoy retirement (if possible), family get-togethers, just life in general. Your dad has chosen to take care of her, and that is okay, but it's also okay that your mom chose not to.\n\nIf your parents wanted to talk about this with someone and not have it get back to your sister, they should have spoken to a therapist.

However you did got told this in confidence and you already know that nothing what you are saying will change her behaviour.

I can also see that you just clicked and coulndt hold it in any longer- but you really should have it phrasend it like your own evaluation, not like a fact your mom told you in secret.

They have limited money, and are divorcing because they can't agree on what to do about that. They are not divorcing \"because they are financially struggling\". The financial struggles are the situation they are in, and their decision to divorce is because they can't agree on what to do about it.
