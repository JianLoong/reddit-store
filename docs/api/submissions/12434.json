This has been quite a shock to most people as they seemed to be having to issues out of the ordinary. However, I have been the one privy to the information of why they are divorcing.\n\nIt's because of my sister \"Anne\" (26 F). Anne is a deadbeat. She has never worked more than 14 hours a week since getting expelled from college for multiple acts of cheating and code of conduct violations 5 years ago. All she does is sit at home most days watching TV or going over to her loser boyfriend's house to get high. She feels no need to support herself and expects my parents to carry her through life. She's been in therapy since she was 14 but cannot keep one for more than a year because she gets dropped as a client due to her lying and inability to show up to appointments. My parents have spent over a decade trying to get some mental issue pinned down for Anne and all they've gotten is she's just a lazy narcissist.\n\nLast year my Mom decided enough was enough and planned to kick Anne to the curb and wash her hands of her. Dad disagreed, and in the end, the two's marriage got torn apart. I know because both have come to me basically admitting that if Anne was not a factor divorce would not even be a consideration. \n\nI don't get along with Anne for a variety of reasons. She has always been a bully and owes me a large sum of money at the moment. The thing that boils my blood though is that she's oblivious to the situation between our parents, or just doesn't care. She had a literal tantrum when the possibility of the house being sold came up because she didn't want to have to move to an apartment with my dad. \n\nLast night I found myself at my parent's house and had the misfortune of talking to Anne. Anne mentioned that she's getting really sick of my mom's \"melodramatic shit\" and not just leaving the house to her and my dad. Something struck me at that moment and I just asked Anne if she really does not care that she's such a selfish, garbage, waste of space human that she's driven her parents to get a divorce. I elaborated, and told her the full truth that she is in fact the only reason they are getting a divorce because mom's finally realized that there is no hope Anne will ever grow up.\n\nThe shitstorm this caused was massive. Anne acted as if I sold her out to the Romans and my parents argued between \"she deserves to know\" and \"we told you that in confidence.\" Because Anne cannot keep her mouth shut either, the entire extended family has begun to hear too.

You were told that in confidence, and you broke that trust. Telling her served no purpose but to create drama, since she is unlikely to change; nor do I see any intent from you to encourage change by telling her.

Question, what is ASPD? Autism spectrum?", "Except you missed my point entirely. I never said anything related to dismissing the possibility of trauma causing a certain personality disorder. That's absolutely true and you don't need to lecture me on such an obvious topic.\n\nMy point was that there is no treatment because it is still a choice to continue on with the personality or to put in serious effort through therapy to change it. *However, it being a choice doesn't specify if it's an easy or hard choice; clearly, you've assumed I meant it's an easy choice.* That doesn't mean that I'm dismissing the difficulty or seriousness of what could have caused the personality disorder, so don't start virtue signaling about your straw-man argument of \"med students just passing the exam.\" The irony is that you haven't even passed the exam because you're not an actual psychiatrist who understands the key differences between biochemical vs psychological disorders of the psyche, or your first response like every virtue signaler on reddit wouldn't be to start ranting about trauma as if that has any relevance to OP's sister here or even what treatment she needs (which is the 10 years of therapy she already had). Even if someone had serious trauma, which very likely OP's sister did not and just simply has narcissistic personality disorder, then it is still on the person to desire the change and put in the significant effort to change.

But there comes a time where we have to let them start making the wrong choices for themselves.\n\nI guess for me I would expect my wife to give her life for the kids if it came right down to it.  She would expect me to do the same if a choice had to be made, and I would.  My wife is still a very high priority so I'm with her on mostly everything when it comes to my wife.  But she has spent a lot of time in the hospital with an illness and while I would like to stay with her all the time the children were the priority because they had school, they have to be fed, they have to be put to bed and driven to school.

Lazy narcissist.\n\nYour parents have spent 10 years doing something called ENABLING. Tell both of them to look that word up. Then tell them to kick your lazy-assed narcissistic sister out of the damned house and realize they're giving up their marriage over a rotten kid. \n\nYour parents are so willing to protect this sorry human from her own reality that they're willing to split up over it. Shameful really. They're going to ruin their own lives and continue to ensure your sister will never grow as a human being.\n\nThe only cure (if there is one at all) for this person is some serious tough love and step one is kick her 26-year-old ass out of the house. She can go live with her boyfriend and be a dope smoking sloth over there if she wants. My parents said I could stay at home as an adult under one condition (well two). 1. I was in school and/or 2. I was looking for a decent job. Once I got set up, I moved out. They saved me tens of thousands in rent I would have had to add to student loans.

She does deserve to know the chaos she\u2019s causing, but blaming their divorce on her is disingenuous at best. Their divorce is because of a disagreement on how to handle an adult problem that *happens to be your sister.* Any number of other similar problems could have happened in which they would have had an unresolvable stalemate.

You should also disabuse yourself of the idea that Anne is the only reason your parents are divorcing, no matter what they said. Parents are not required to tell their children all the details about their private relationship. There is likely more breadth and depth to this than what they shared with you.

That puts them in a super awkward position, during what\u2019s already a really difficult time in their lives, and will do real damage to your relationships w/ them if you\u2019re not careful.

One of your parents wants to carry her on their back, and use her as a scapegoat, the other doesn't. Stay out of your parents' business unless it personally AND directly affects you.
