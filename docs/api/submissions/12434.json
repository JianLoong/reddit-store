This has been quite a shock to most people as they seemed to be having to issues out of the ordinary. However, I have been the one privy to the information of why they are divorcing.\n\nIt's because of my sister \"Anne\" (26 F). Anne is a deadbeat. She has never worked more than 14 hours a week since getting expelled from college for multiple acts of cheating and code of conduct violations 5 years ago. All she does is sit at home most days watching TV or going over to her loser boyfriend's house to get high. She feels no need to support herself and expects my parents to carry her through life. She's been in therapy since she was 14 but cannot keep one for more than a year because she gets dropped as a client due to her lying and inability to show up to appointments. My parents have spent over a decade trying to get some mental issue pinned down for Anne and all they've gotten is she's just a lazy narcissist.\n\nLast year my Mom decided enough was enough and planned to kick Anne to the curb and wash her hands of her. Dad disagreed, and in the end, the two's marriage got torn apart. I know because both have come to me basically admitting that if Anne was not a factor divorce would not even be a consideration. \n\nI don't get along with Anne for a variety of reasons. She has always been a bully and owes me a large sum of money at the moment. The thing that boils my blood though is that she's oblivious to the situation between our parents, or just doesn't care. She had a literal tantrum when the possibility of the house being sold came up because she didn't want to have to move to an apartment with my dad. \n\nLast night I found myself at my parent's house and had the misfortune of talking to Anne. Anne mentioned that she's getting really sick of my mom's \"melodramatic shit\" and not just leaving the house to her and my dad. Something struck me at that moment and I just asked Anne if she really does not care that she's such a selfish, garbage, waste of space human that she's driven her parents to get a divorce. I elaborated, and told her the full truth that she is in fact the only reason they are getting a divorce because mom's finally realized that there is no hope Anne will ever grow up.\n\nThe shitstorm this caused was massive. Anne acted as if I sold her out to the Romans and my parents argued between \"she deserves to know\" and \"we told you that in confidence.\" Because Anne cannot keep her mouth shut either, the entire extended family has begun to hear too.

You were told that in confidence, and you broke that trust. Telling her served no purpose but to create drama, since she is unlikely to change; nor do I see any intent from you to encourage change by telling her.

My sister had some issues, and twice lived with my parents with a boyfriend who was...not great. The stress of figuring out what to do- kick them both out, give an ultimatum, being annoyed at different things at different times and then having sympathy at other times- was the source of a lot of fighting between my parents. It was impossible to know what was the right thing (kick out or support), when to pull the trigger, and even when they would agree on the boundary, something new would come up, or one would be manipulated. Of course it isn't just the person, but it is all the frustration and communications breakdowns, along with manipulation, that can fully cause a marriage to fall apart. \n\nNow, just be there fully for your mom. Remind her she has given so much to Anne already, and she needs to get her share of the house and anything else. Give her extra hugs, a safe place, agree to go with her to the house or wherever she might have to deal with this issue. Do not apologize for telling Anne the truth, and remember your Mom feels fully like a failure- both with her child and her marriage- and she needs you now. And by the way, sure she did \"fail\" but lots of great people raise shitty children, shitty people raise great children, and some raise both kinds of kids. There isn't a science to figuring out how to motivate a child, and your mom - it seems- did try, it is just an very hard puzzle to solve.", "NTA\n\nI have an aunt not much different than Anne. She's in her 50s and still lives in my grandma's basement. Her only goal in life is to mooch off others. No one knows what's going to happen to her when grandma passes because none of the family will take her in. This could very easily be your sister's future. \n\nTelling Anne might not make any difference; she might always be selfish and entitled because she's gotten away with it for so long.

No. NTA\n\nHonestly the level of Oblivious that Ann has to be living at to have this literally going down in the house where she lives....that's almost impressive. \n\nI also don't see the harm in the extended fam knowing the real reason?

Anne seems like a scapegoat for a crummy family with her own issues to address.\n\nI'm in agreement that \"Anne\" is going to need to face some truths and make some changes as she is clearly running away from something but she's stuck so deep in escaping / dissociating that she's not taking care of the responsibilities (esp to herself) that she should be.\n\nEveryone has problems even if there is someone to blame. If I lose a leg to a rogue chainsaw and it's the fault of some drunk logger or something I can absolutely blame the person who caused me harm. I cannot, however, blame them for what choices I make afterwards while I live on and deal with having 1 leg or a prosthetic or what have you. \n\nThat being said, I don't think \"Anne\" was just born this way and through nothing but a perfect upbringing of love she became this version of herself. I don't believe that's how humans work. I believe she clearly has trauma and I'm willing to bet your parents are the source as they have clearly already turned you, the OP, into someone who is willing to insult and break down his own sister over politics that they have created and essentially passed on to you.\n\nI'd be wary of your parents as they're willing to turn on their children.

They need to figure out their crap and stop coddling her and also learn to communicate with each other and work together as a team. \n\nIf I were to guess, this is only the drop that overflowed the bucket, and your parents have had differences for some time until they got to a point that they couldn\u2019t ignore this one. \n\nWhen I was a kid, my parents used to tell me that it was my fault when they argued about my behavior and what punisment was appropriate\u2026the reasoning being that if I had behaved myself they would not have argued.

Yes.\n\nIs your dad the reason for the divorce?

The sister isn't the reason they are getting divorced, it's the father's coddling and inability to hold her accountable whilst the mother has had enough.

I don\u2019t think wishing is going to work either because we all know that one person who we wish will grow up and change their behavior, but they never do. Negative behaviors are hard to change and the only way to successfully change them is 1) you want to change voluntarily or 2) something difficult happens and that forces you to want to change. \n\nMaybe the only way to force her to change is by allowing the divorce to proceed and she moves in with her dad into an apartment.

One spouse wants the addiction to end, the other refuses to acknowledge it.
