This has been quite a shock to most people as they seemed to be having to issues out of the ordinary. However, I have been the one privy to the information of why they are divorcing.\n\nIt's because of my sister \"Anne\" (26 F). Anne is a deadbeat. She has never worked more than 14 hours a week since getting expelled from college for multiple acts of cheating and code of conduct violations 5 years ago. All she does is sit at home most days watching TV or going over to her loser boyfriend's house to get high. She feels no need to support herself and expects my parents to carry her through life. She's been in therapy since she was 14 but cannot keep one for more than a year because she gets dropped as a client due to her lying and inability to show up to appointments. My parents have spent over a decade trying to get some mental issue pinned down for Anne and all they've gotten is she's just a lazy narcissist.\n\nLast year my Mom decided enough was enough and planned to kick Anne to the curb and wash her hands of her. Dad disagreed, and in the end, the two's marriage got torn apart. I know because both have come to me basically admitting that if Anne was not a factor divorce would not even be a consideration. \n\nI don't get along with Anne for a variety of reasons. She has always been a bully and owes me a large sum of money at the moment. The thing that boils my blood though is that she's oblivious to the situation between our parents, or just doesn't care. She had a literal tantrum when the possibility of the house being sold came up because she didn't want to have to move to an apartment with my dad. \n\nLast night I found myself at my parent's house and had the misfortune of talking to Anne. Anne mentioned that she's getting really sick of my mom's \"melodramatic shit\" and not just leaving the house to her and my dad. Something struck me at that moment and I just asked Anne if she really does not care that she's such a selfish, garbage, waste of space human that she's driven her parents to get a divorce. I elaborated, and told her the full truth that she is in fact the only reason they are getting a divorce because mom's finally realized that there is no hope Anne will ever grow up.\n\nThe shitstorm this caused was massive. Anne acted as if I sold her out to the Romans and my parents argued between \"she deserves to know\" and \"we told you that in confidence.\" Because Anne cannot keep her mouth shut either, the entire extended family has begun to hear too.

You were told that in confidence, and you broke that trust. Telling her served no purpose but to create drama, since she is unlikely to change; nor do I see any intent from you to encourage change by telling her.

In most cases, psychologists struggle to even break the first barrier, which is getting the patient to accept they are a narcissist to begin with.\n\nSo I do agree parents totally have some agency here they aren't using. But if they've been pushing her to go to therapy for years and she refuses to engage, as OP has stated, they've probably done all they could do in this situation.

But kids don't have the means or capacity to fully care for themselves. Adults do. So for both members of a couple to prioritize children who are vulnerable and incapable of taking care of themselves is entirely different than doing so with an adult child. \n\nThese parents raised two children and they ended up vastly different because it's not just a matter of how you raise a child, but their innate self that determines what type of adult they'll be.", "Could have been laziness too. Sometimes it's so much easier to give into a kid then deal with the battle.", "I agree, children have a great capacity for independence.

Choosing/prioritizing a kid doesn't mean giving them whatever they want/ask for, it means parenting them. You protect them from harm, not consequences. One thing kids need (some more than others) is help learning to be independent.
