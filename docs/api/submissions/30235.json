The idea that if you lie deeply enough, well enough, for long enough you should be able to drain your victim forever as if your lie were true and what you are doing were virtuous, is a perversion of justice.

What if a man\u2019s insurance company gets its hands on it and decides to raise their rates because their predisposed to certain ailments? \n\n- women and babies will be killed. Now I\u2019m not condoning cheating. It\u2019s wrong. And passing off a pregnancy by another man is incredibly cruel. But it\u2019s not a death sentence level offense. Getting married, getting pregnant and giving birth are well known triggers for a relationship to turn abusive. It\u2019s so bad that when I was going in to my OB appointments I was asked every time if my husband was still treating me well. When I went in for a D&C following a miscarriage they asked me if he was angry with me about losing the baby, or if he had caused it in any way. A recently born baby and a woman trying to recover from childbirth are some of the most vulnerable people out there. This testing puts them at risk of serious violence and death. Besides, what if the hospital gets the paperwork mixed up? Mine charges me for procedures we didn\u2019t even do\u2026", "DNA testing should be automatic and happen before the BC is generated IMO.

Everything that was hers gets commingled for purposes of a criminal investigation/tax fraud investigation and if he's ordered to pay back anything, her assets even separate ones from before marriage can be used to pay that back whether she agrees to it or not. Even if he declared bankruptcy to discharge some of it, her separate assets are considered part of it and used to pay off creditors. Her property / car can have a lien put on it.

But even assuming that's above board, Jack is essentially still working there / in a partnership and not being paid, not profit sharing, and simply getting these sorts of ad hoc in kind payments of expenses as needed. Op as the employer actually may be violating labor laws to start with. The payments he describes do not qualify as business expenses. There is well settled case law recognizing that the use of corporate structure in order to commit misconduct can actually strip you of many of the protections using an llc would otherwise afford you.

There's a ton going on here that is reminiscent of bribery, corruption, and could be considered a sort of quid pro quo depending on the specific details. \n\nIn white collar cases, even independently wealthy spouses with prenups, and separate assets from one another oftentimes get screwed. Even if it's just as collateral damage while investigations and cases are ongoing, it can be untenable. \n\nThere are tons of laws that say you cannot give money to various people or entities, or in specific circumstances or purposes, or pretextually frame things as gifts when there's more going on. Maybe op should stop committing and aiding in criminal and civil violations before he gets to be all indignant. \n\nI think the fianc\u00e9e should walk for her own sake and good - it's wild you're acting like he's the victim and she's some sort of harassing harpy.absolutely fucking disgusting mindset and take.", "You could throw out a child you'd raised for ten years?
