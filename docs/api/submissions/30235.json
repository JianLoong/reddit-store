Getting married, getting pregnant and giving birth are well known triggers for a relationship to turn abusive. It\u2019s so bad that when I was going in to my OB appointments I was asked every time if my husband was still treating me well. When I went in for a D&C following a miscarriage they asked me if he was angry with me about losing the baby, or if he had caused it in any way. A recently born baby and a woman trying to recover from childbirth are some of the most vulnerable people out there. This testing puts them at risk of serious violence and death. Besides, what if the hospital gets the paperwork mixed up? Mine charges me for procedures we didn\u2019t even do\u2026", "DNA testing should be automatic and happen before the BC is generated IMO.

Everything that was hers gets commingled for purposes of a criminal investigation/tax fraud investigation and if he's ordered to pay back anything, her assets even separate ones from before marriage can be used to pay that back whether she agrees to it or not. Even if he declared bankruptcy to discharge some of it, her separate assets are considered part of it and used to pay off creditors. Her property / car can have a lien put on it.

That's mind-blowing to me.  \n\n\nThis WAS his son. He raised him for 10 years. That's what being a father is, not \"how much does he look like you\"!? This man didn't deserve to have a child to begin with. (and spare me the \"what about what the mother did\", it is 100% unrelated to the matter of HE ABANDONED HIS OWN SON).", "The repercussions suffered by the mother are 100% deserved. It is despicable to abandon a ten year old that spent the past ten years being loved and cared for by his father. Both fatherhood and motherhood are defined by more than DNA. He loved, cared for, raised, and supported that child for ten years. Abandoning the child is unconscionable.", "OP is on the birth certificate and therefore will forever be his legal parent. This cannot be overturned, certainly not after ten years. You cannot get child support from anybody but the legal parent. That\u2019s legally just not possible, at least not in the US. I understand this was heartbreaking for Jack as well as the kid. Yet, legally it\u2019s not his decision to make. He is and will forever remain this kid\u2019s father.

You can disagree with me or the government as much as you like, but legally Jack will forever be the kid\u2019s dad. He will be on the hook for child support and all other legal obligations till the kid\u2019s 18. A paternity test won\u2019t change that, no matter how much you or Jack disagree with that. That\u2019s what has been democratically decided in the USA.", "Yes, that means he has a say in how she spends money. As I said, they are a UNIT. My husband and I have a rule between us that if we want to spend money on something over $150, we talk to each other about said purchase to make sure we\u2019re on the same page. That is the whole purpose of being a partnership in marriage. You discuss things TOGETHER and it seems fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t happy that OP is spending all this money on Jack who, really, isn\u2019t owed anything in this situation. He lost is business during the pandemic which is unfortunately but OP didn\u2019t just get given this business. He bought it and spent whatever money getting it back to being what it once was. \n\nThey BOTH have a say in how money is spent.", "I'm well aware of how businesses run - I'm an attorney, used to work in BigLaw and in my civil and human rights practice do a ton of complex litigation and work against multinational corporations and their domestic subsidiaries/ sub entities which involves a lot of familiarity with banking and tax implications and general corporate governance. \n\nThe way op described the handover / takeover of the business is already potentially problematic depending on the specifics. But even assuming that's above board, Jack is essentially still working there / in a partnership and not being paid, not profit sharing, and simply getting these sorts of ad hoc in kind payments of expenses as needed. Op as the employer actually may be violating labor laws to start with. The payments he describes do not qualify as business expenses. There is well settled case law recognizing that the use of corporate structure in order to commit misconduct can actually strip you of many of the protections using an llc would otherwise afford you. Using it to aid and abet or conspire to avoid child support, commit financial crimes including violating disclosure and notice requirements, or tax fraud/ evasion - all of those can pierce the veil and result in personal liability. \n\nAiding and abetting Jack in avoiding paying taxes (gift taxes are also a thing) or financial disclosure requirements he may have with family court is also not above board. In many cases too even if at the end her assets are deemed to be wholly separate and protected, during the course of an investigation or during court proceedings or administrative disputes - the government can absolutely just treat all her assets as commingled or his for a \"temporary\" timeframe that can last years. There's a ton going on here that is reminiscent of bribery, corruption, and could be considered a sort of quid pro quo depending on the specific details. \n\nIn white collar cases, even independently wealthy spouses with prenups, and separate assets from one another oftentimes get screwed. Even if it's just as collateral damage while investigations and cases are ongoing, it can be untenable. \n\nThere are tons of laws that say you cannot give money to various people or entities, or in specific circumstances or purposes, or pretextually frame things as gifts when there's more going on. Maybe op should stop committing and aiding in criminal and civil violations before he gets to be all indignant. \n\nI think the fianc\u00e9e should walk for her own sake and good - it's wild you're acting like he's the victim and she's some sort of harassing harpy.absolutely fucking disgusting mindset and take.", "You could throw out a child you'd raised for ten years? What is *wrong* with you?", "The point is that OP is doing it cause his friend is a valuable contributor to his business. Fianc\u00e9 is not involved in business decisions.

He\u2019s a deadbeat. Nothing more.", "Fair point.", "That's a whole other can of worms. You really think that wouldn't be a red flag to the IRS? Company changes hands, trips for the holidays gets written off? Is Jack worth the audit and tax penalties? \n\nI have no issue with him paying his friend but I think it should be a set amount with closure instead of a never-ending spigot.", "I agree with you. I can't imagine raising a child for 10 years just to abandon them because they don't share the same DNA. They're still my child. I raised them. I saw them grow up. I just can't imagine how anyone can abandon the child they raised for a decade because of not having their DNA. At that point DNA doesn't even matter anymore. It's so bizarre. Did he never have an emotional connection to his child? How can he be okay with abandoning the child and even be pissed off at having to pay child support. My heart breaks for the child. \n\nESH", "I\u2019d agree that abandoning a child is a worse harm, but it\u2019s also a lot more understandable.  If we are talking about culpability for that terrible outcome, it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to place it all on the father who was not the one who created the situation and who got fucked over too.", "Sounds like Jack was faking love. Plenty of parents do. The idea that everyone will automagically love a child they raise is mythical. \n\nIf your kid has your partner's worst traits and doesn't remind you of people you love (brother's dimple, aunt's exact fidget habit) it can be really hard to find love for them as they do typical annoying kids things ALL THE TIME.\n\nStill a shitty thing to do to a kid, but an understandable response.", "And that Child will grow up and learn that his Mother is too blame.", "Exactly. If I found out that my kids had somehow been switched at birth, that would be strange and confusing and complicated but it would not alter in any way how much I love these little people I've been raising for over a decade.", "It's not how it SHOULD work, but apparently it's how it does work for a lot of people. It sucks.", "I can see where you are coming from. But this sounds like the ultimate betrayal and while yes it wasn\u2019t the child\u2019s fault\u2026 I think it\u2019s unfair to talk down on him for removing himself from the situation. That\u2019s my personal opinion. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s bonded with the child but seeing the child is painful. I also think it\u2019s on the mother to try and fix the mess she\u2019s made.", "That\u2019s why he left", " Did you?", "What are you talking about? It can 100% be changed the actual father just has to take responsibility", "That same government used to say that citizens were allowed to buy and sell people for slave labor. The government is not, and never has been the arbiter of morality, so your position of \"IT'S THE LAW!!!\" doesn't hold water.\n\nWhen injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.\n- Thomas Jefferson", "Actually he is owed this money he helped start the business he is employed by the business and how he has paid is up to the business.\n\nSo in your case it would be OK if every other day he gave him $150 nothing can be said right? He has a right to spend his money however he wants just because she doesn\u2019t like him doesn\u2019t mean that he hast to stop doing what he\u2019s been doing.\n\nAs far as the business is his business and again if unless she is a A legal owner of sad business she has no rights to that business.\n\nIf she insists on dictating to him how he spends the business money and his money then he really needs a tight prenup. Again unless she is part owner of the business she has no say in how that business is run even after they get married.\n\nThat is why he really needs to rethink the marriage. In today\u2019s world marriage really means nothing anyway other than you\u2019re responsible for the other person for life.\n\nHe feels a debt is owed to his friend and he is helping his friend. How he spends his money at this point is none of her business. Now if he decides to make her a part owner in the business then there would be an issue.

So tell me what law is it that you cannot give your own money to a friend? Is there a law that you cannot keep giving your own money to a friend?\n\nYou are right she should run as should he. Is there a certain amount that you\u2019re not allowed to give money to your friend? Maybe he needs to be aware of that law that he can\u2019t give money to friends. She is already telling him how he can spend his money and who he can be friends with. What he does with his own money is up to him.

Surely you get that?\nSome people can be in a car wreck and drive the next day. Some people may have issues even getting in a car that plague them for years.

They are not income. He has chosen his income by accepting the assistant manager position, there is no obligation on his part to increase his income. Nobody can force him to increase his income. Without the gifts, he would instead just be isolated from his friend group. Hate to break it to you, but youre allowed to have friends and accept gifts from friends even if you have child support payments. All they are doing is keeping him involved in their lives.
