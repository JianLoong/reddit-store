This pattern of neglect in the early stages of brain development WILL have an effect on this child. Not just emotionally. Literally in the way their brain is wired. Even if she gets her shit together at age three, infant neglect will have LIFELONG consequences because their BRAINS are being wired right now. You could be adopted by the best parents in the world at age three, but if you\u2019ve been neglected as a baby, your brain is wired differently and it is nearly impossible to undo the damage. \n\nRight now, today, you need to call CPS.

I had friends who were removed from their home and thankfully were actually given good foster parents. It\u2019s not impossible. I will acknowledge though that it\u2019s rare.

I will say, once you go to the system that\u2019s kind of it. There\u2019s no way back out. I did know girls who went from neglect and abusive to a strange new household without their siblings, and sometimes and often there were  *different* kinds of abuse (if you catch my drift). Sometimes they went to shit situations where it was awfully hard to agree that it was better, and it certainly seemed worse for the separation of siblings plus abuse of the same kind but from new and unkown parties with often other kids in the mix.\n\nI feel free to admit that the majority of my friends who I met from foster care didn\u2019t like their situations any better.\n\nThat said, your truth is real, but it is not a definite for everyone\u2019s reality.

I\u2019m not sure about legally, but at that point you are definitely morally obligated to intervene.", "They are right it wont win her any favors in custody hearing and especially telling you in front of him that she didn\u2019t want him to see their son. She can\u2019t just decide that. It\u2019s also not smart to not have someone sober to care for the baby. She is going through a break up but when you have a baby it\u2019s not about you anymore unless you have a sitter before you party.", "NTA for all that others said, but I NEED to know if the father took the baby with him that night", "NTA and good riddance to this friendship. I could never be around someone who treated their child that way. I'd honestly probably go to the custody hearing and support the dad. This is disgusting, the child is not a cat you can just lock in your room for 6 hours while you drink yourself silly with who knows how many people in your house.", "NTA.\n\nCall CPS on her ass, she is endangering that childs life.", "NTA and I think you did a favor to their child if he wins the custody. He needed that, since if it's true that mothers are favored in custody fights. I have only read about it, and it seems the discrimination towards dads is clear atleast in United States. \n\nLet's hope the child will end up at the right parent.", "NTA Good job OP!", "NTA. She did the wrong thing and was neglecting her baby.", "You did in fact do the right now. I hope the baby is doing well. I would have advised at the given time that you should have also called the cops while you were at it of being thrown out, along with the father of the baby calling them as well. She is strongly unfit for caring for this child. It\u2019s one thing that everyone parents differently, it\u2019s another thing when parents neglect their children.", "> Tom will use this when they fight for custody, and it will probably favour him now\n\nGood.", "Nta", "NTA. \n\n\nHer: lemme get real drunk with like forty other people and ignore my infant child for a few hours\n\n\nYou, intelligent despite being drunk: I\u2019ll call his dad to look after him\n\n\nHer, a neglectful mother and all-round dumbass: no, I don\u2019t want to see him\n\n\nSo, she\u2019d rather her infant kid suffer? Stellar person.", "NTA. That is horrible.", "The only thing I think you could have potentially done differently is confronted her first, told her its not okay to leave her son alone like that and find out who would she like to call, or if she already had someone on the way (which it doesnt sound like she did). However based on her reaction she doesn't sound like a reasonable or stable person so in hindsight i think what you did was the best thing and any consequences she faces are her own fault. NTA.", "Yup!  Always have a sober adult around when drinking. Or get a sitter.", "Like what the fuck. Who has a party, gets drunk, and leaves a 4 month old upstairs alone??? This is what she\u2019s doing when they\u2019re an infant. What more atrocities will she commit when they\u2019re a bit more grown?", "The fact he was 4months and not 4 years or even 2 is serious! Thats too little for CIO . They need constant attention. Like every 4 hours through out the night .", "Infants have sensitive ears, they cant handle loud noises like we can.", "Stop defending yourself to these\u2026people. You absolutely did the right thing.", "Yep. NTA. Maya is an unfit parent.  She\u2019s like those ppl who leave their kids in a car in the parking lot of a bar or casino unattended.  They should have the custody agreement amended since she lacks critical thinking skills.", "Not really, I don't invite my siblings to my birthday parties", "I am. Like how can you be close enough with your sister to accept the idea (or reality) of them looking after your kid, but you don\u2019t invite them to your birthday party.\n\nSeems odd to me. But I also don\u2019t have siblings so maybe I just don\u2019t get it", "That\u2019s not a good blanket statement to make though. A lot of families will protect abusive parents and foster care isn\u2019t always terrible.\n\nIt depends on the situation and each case is different", "Yeah I once started a lawnmower and skateboarded around the yard at a house party. No one in a state like I was in should be near an unattended baby", "no because he is the father. He has more right to HIS child than anyone else OP could have called.", "I really wish I hadn't read this.", "That\u2019s pretty reasonable for someone with no baby experience in their 20s \u2026 but Maya has incubated this baby and had to take care of it for the past 4 months \u2026 she has enough hands-on experience to know better exactly how much care a newborn/infant needs.   Someone\u2019s gotta be sober at all times.", "This just happened to someone in my country. They were an indigenous person with family member supports in place, they did everything that child and family services told her to do, but they still apprehended her baby in the hospital after it was born. \n\nIt took weeks and a politician ended up bringing it up in parliament before they were reunited.", "She couldn't have walked downstairs and spent 30 seconds talking to Maya?", "The wasted mom who left her crying infant upstairs alone?"]}
