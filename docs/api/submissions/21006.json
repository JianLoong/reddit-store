She invited me to her birthday, a 'Tacos and Tequila' night.  \n\nI was late to the party due to traffic, and surprised by the number of people in her flat. There was a groupchat for the party that had around 15 people, and I could see 40ish in her garden. Most people were very drunk, and I was sober at the point. I saw Maya and ahe dragged me to do a shot with her, that turned into about 4. I wore a nice coat and even though I was tipsy I remember feeling warm and wanting to put it away in case it gets dirty. I asked Maya if I could go put it away. She told me to put it on her bed upstairs. I went upstairs, and I saw her 4mo son was in his cot. \n\nHe was crying, and I didn't hear it before as there was loud music. Maya was definitely too drunk to take care of him, and I am a massive lightweight, so I knew the shots would hit me soon, so I wouldn't be able to either. I called Maya's ex-boyfriend Tom (her son's dad) to come and collect the baby, as it was definitely unsafe to leave him unattended. Tom thanked me for letting him know and said he'd be over soon. Maya saw me open the door for Tom and slammed it on his face. She yelled at me saying they'd just broken up and she didn't want to see him. I remember letting Tom in again and trying to console her but she flat out started screaming at both Tom and me and kicked us both out. \n\nI genuinely don't think I was in the wrong for calling Tom and thought Maya when sober would agree, but this morning she has texted me calling me TA, and that I literally could've called anyone else to help out with her son. Most of our friends were drunk at the party. Some of our mutual friends who overheard us think I should have called her sister instead. Tom will use this when they fight for custody, and it will probably favour him now. I wasn't completely sober at the time, but my boyfriend is saying I did the right thing. Maya is my friend and I love her, but I couldn't leave her son like that.", "created_utc": 1688158840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbzw9/aita_for_drunk_calling_my_friends_exboyfriend_to/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She honestly doesn't sound like a mom who wants custody", "Tom will use this in court because this is a massive F-up that could have caused his kid harm.

This was an unsafe environment for a baby. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Even wasted you showed more concern for her child then she did. She should not be getting wasted with the baby there. He deserves to win custody.", "NTA, but for future reference that was the moment you needed to call social services for an immediate intervention to remove the baby from the house, and place them in their father's care for the night. You should not have left that baby there without a single sober person to care for them.\n\nHonestly you should still report this. If she's done it once, she will do it again.", "NTA. She\u2019s lucky you were smart enough to call the baby\u2019s father and not involve CPS, as some idiots would do.

Maya is a giant asshole to her own child. Tom should use this in the custody battle. I hope he gets the custody.", "She purposely decided to save on the baby sitter and figured she would keep a loose eye on him. Yeah OP could have called her sister but it\u2019s better for the baby if she loses custody.

She straight up deserves CPS called on her for what she did that was down right disgusting. CPS would of also handed the child off to the father if he was able to take custody as well. CPS won\u2019t just go and collect a baby to put into the system all because of one parent, they will try to have the baby be with other members of the family if possible.", "NTA but it's not about the drunk party as it is about not securing a babysitter for her child IMO", "It's British English.", "If OP is from the UK, cot is a term for crib.

The party started at half 11, and I thought with her son being so young, she would have arranged for childcare. I was tipsy when I called her ex, and I didn;t think to call anyone else. I was not in teh frame of mind to think ahead, I was concerned about the baby first and foremost.", "Found the friend!", "It SHOULD be used against her, sorry but  you don\u2019t leave a 4mo alone to go get drunk it\u2019s not that hard to get a babysitter", "She was neglecting her baby and it should be used against her", "Dunno what the US is like but in the UK if you call social services for something like this depending on the social worker you get they may well take the baby from both parents as the father left his son with Maya in the first place. Depending on how much of a power trip they want to have getting the poor kid out of the system and back to the father can be a nightmare and can have lasting consequences for the child. Not really an idiot move in my opinion as social services should absolutely be involved if you feel it necessary (better safe than sorry) but generally it's better to try the second parent first and deal with it on a personal level if possible.", "The fact that you truly believe that is sad. I have a friend who\u2019s two daughters were removed from her home because she had a seizure disorder (which she was being treated for) and despite having a roommate and making sure her daughters never witnessed a seizure CPS said there was \u201cpotential for neglect\u201d because she might have a seizure when no other adult was home. Multiple family members offered to take the children, but CPS would not work with them to get them certified. Both girls ended up in the system and were mentally abused in foster care until their mother was able to prove the lies being told about her in court. \n\nCPS should be an absolute last resort in the most extreme of circumstances for the sake and safety of children.", "Ah should have known OP wasn\u2019t in the US from the use of \u201cflat.\u201d Thanks. Leaving the judgment though!", "You did the right thing, it\u2019s better for the father of the child to take care of the baby over anyone else first unless the father is an absolute deadbeat which it doesn\u2019t sound like he is from your post.", "Right, if your kid is at your house and nobody is actively watching them for you, then guess what? You don\u2019t have any right to get shitfaced that night. Even worse is that it\u2019s an infant who needs checked on consistently, yet she\u2019s down there fucked up taking shots and drowning out his cries with music. Hope she loses custody.", "That would make sense then and I\u2019m sure the same would go with the US depending on who you got as well. Sadly I think it\u2019s pretty universal that if you get someone with a stick in the butt they will make it hell for everyone.", "That\u2019s terrible that that happened to your friend and while I may agree it should be a last resort my biggest issue with what you said is calling someone an idiot for calling CPS just because of this one event that happened. Discounting the whole of CPS for one event to me seems a bit unfair and more unfair to call someone who may think it\u2019s the right thing to do an idiot but that\u2019s just my opinion. You feel how you want."]}
