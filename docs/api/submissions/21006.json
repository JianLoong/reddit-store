She invited me to her birthday, a 'Tacos and Tequila' night.  \n\nI was late to the party due to traffic, and surprised by the number of people in her flat. There was a groupchat for the party that had around 15 people, and I could see 40ish in her garden. Most people were very drunk, and I was sober at the point. I saw Maya and ahe dragged me to do a shot with her, that turned into about 4. I wore a nice coat and even though I was tipsy I remember feeling warm and wanting to put it away in case it gets dirty. I asked Maya if I could go put it away. She told me to put it on her bed upstairs. I went upstairs, and I saw her 4mo son was in his cot. \n\nHe was crying, and I didn't hear it before as there was loud music. Maya was definitely too drunk to take care of him, and I am a massive lightweight, so I knew the shots would hit me soon, so I wouldn't be able to either. I called Maya's ex-boyfriend Tom (her son's dad) to come and collect the baby, as it was definitely unsafe to leave him unattended. Tom thanked me for letting him know and said he'd be over soon. Maya saw me open the door for Tom and slammed it on his face. She yelled at me saying they'd just broken up and she didn't want to see him. I remember letting Tom in again and trying to console her but she flat out started screaming at both Tom and me and kicked us both out. \n\nI genuinely don't think I was in the wrong for calling Tom and thought Maya when sober would agree, but this morning she has texted me calling me TA, and that I literally could've called anyone else to help out with her son. Most of our friends were drunk at the party. Some of our mutual friends who overheard us think I should have called her sister instead. Tom will use this when they fight for custody, and it will probably favour him now. I wasn't completely sober at the time, but my boyfriend is saying I did the right thing. Maya is my friend and I love her, but I couldn't leave her son like that.", "created_utc": 1688158840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nbzw9/aita_for_drunk_calling_my_friends_exboyfriend_to/", "score": 337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s terrifying the number of children who are legally kidnapped, often medically kidnapped, by CPS. Even when there\u2019s a reason for a child to be removed from the home, they are not always any safer in foster care. People can downvote me all they want, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s a very broken system, not designed to protect children or families. The number of people who just blindly think that it\u2019s a good solution and should be called willy-nilly for situations that could be dealt with without risking the safety of children is scary. If people are too ignorant to look around and see how many kids are lost, abused, and die while in \u201cprotective\u201d custody and still try to get CPS involved when it doesn\u2019t need to be then, yes, they are idiots. As a mandated reporter, knowing and seeing the truth, it terrifies me to think about the fact that I could be the one to potentially put a child in a dangerous and traumatizing situation."]}
