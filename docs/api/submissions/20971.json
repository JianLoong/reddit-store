A group of young adults sharing a house drinking for a week with a big dog is a perfectly fine vacation for said young adults, but it\u2019s really not a baby friendly situation. If you are determined to still go on this trip you need to at least do a trial baby / dog interaction before going. You also need to remember that your baby\u2019s safety is 100% your and your husband\u2019s responsibility and just because there are other adults in the house doesn\u2019t mean they are responsible for watching out for them.", "ESH for not discussing the situation *before* booking the vacation house.

There will be hazards EVERYWHERE for your baby- open luggage, staircases, electrical wires and sockets, heavy furniture that isn\u2019t attached to the wall, objects she can pull down on herself, hot and sharp things in the kitchen, curtains and cords she can strangle herself with, cleaning products, etc. This is not to scare you, but she shouldn\u2019t be free to crawl all over your rental anyway. You\u2019re sharing the space with other people and should keep her contained and safe. Your friends should have equal use of the space and honestly, how drunk are these adults going to get around your baby? Won\u2019t she be asleep when the heavy drinking takes place? The dog won\u2019t be a problem when she is sleeping. Take her outside to play or set up a small, \u201cdog free\u201d, childproofed area in one room.

It would be unfair to lock the baby up in the playpen while the dog roams free all the time.", "Gonna go against the grain here and say NAH, just a group of adults that didn't plan super well. \n\nOn the one hand, I have worked with dogs my whole life and even my best trained companion was kept separated from children under ~7yo, **no exceptions.** Even a patient and wonderful dog can get annoyed at a human baby poking and prodding it and since dogs correct puppies with quick nips/barks in their direction, that normal dog communication can accidentally hurt a human baby. My current dog would *never* even get that far into his irritation, but he is a hurricane made of bricks and could knock over even a small adult if he gets a zoomie and doesn't pay attention to where he's going. (He's a year old, we're growing out of it) Even friendly dogs can accidentally hurt a baby, that's just a fact. \n\nOP is right to keep her baby separated even if she didn't have a fear. I really appreciate people keeping their children safe and away from dogs. I work in rescue, and if more humans were this vigilant my job would be a lot easier.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems like the friend specifically planned to be able to bring her dog and does not want to keep it put up for most of the trip. This I also understand, doggy day care at the last minute is expensive! Finding someone at the last minute to watch a loved animal can be a hassle.\n\nGet together, work on a schedule for the doggy crate/baby play pen that doesn't keep either too cooped up. Come up with times for the doggy to go on a hike/walk for a while, and/or for the baby to have a baby-appropriate activity outside of the house so each can enjoy the space. Good Luck!", "Usually dog are much more patient with young childrens but I still understand your fear, I don't have a child but I have a big dog and I'm never relaxed when my nefew roam around the dog even when I know it's safe so I think your concern are understandable for sure.\n\nI do believe that planning around to fit everyone's need as best as possible is the right move and I think that NAH because everybody seem guenine in their concerns or lack there off.\n\nBut you definitely need to discuss and figure something out all together.", "YTA/ESH for trying to bring a baby to a house with a bunch of drinking adults and free roaming dogs when you are scared of dogs .

If that goes well you'll probably be fine, just don't let the dog and the baby be together without an adult there at any point.

So I\u2019m not sure what difference having the dog there makes? Let her crawl around, if she starts going near the dog redirect her and/or let her her interact with the dog under your direct supervision.

You will need to watch her like a hawk anyways. Just don\u2019t let her touch the dog. Kids that young are not usually gentle with dogs. Its unfair to expect them not to react to pain. Just don\u2019t let your child touch the dog and you shouldn\u2019t have issues assuming this is a normal well tempered dog.

You can\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to just let her crawl all over the house by herself, dog or no dog. You or your husband are going to have to either hold her, watch her, or use a playpen all the time anyhow.", "Yeah, I rehab dogs for aggression and reactivity. I agree with everything you said except meeting the dog early. \n\nEven my dog at home, who is a giant baby man and would never hurt a fly, does not meet children unless they are over approx 7yo. Babies and toddlers have grabby little hands ages 3-6 are a crapshoot on how well they listen, and even a friendly dog can get to the point where they correct the behavior- which for dogs means a quick nip/teeth showing/shoulder check. \n\nThis correction on a puppy is appropriate and safe, that same correction on a human baby is dangerous. My current guy would never hold still long enough for a toddler to grab him, but he could accidentally knock the baby over in his greeting excitement. (He's 1yo, gets the zoomies but doesn't jump- he still accidentally runs into me somethimes lol)\n\nIt's not this hypothetical baby's fault, and it's not this hypothetical dog's fault that the baby got hit with a puppy correction or accidentally knocked over. But the only way to completely prevent it is to wait until the children are over certain age or to keep the dog totally separated. \n\nThis group needs to get a grip and compromise. \ud83e\udd37", "I would argue that humans can be just as unpredictable as animals.\n\nBoth parties are at fault for not communicating this issue prior to booking.\n\nESH", "Just stop.

Park, playground, fenced area. So many possibilities. I just don't see this as a black and white issue. Having a baby doesn't mean stop doing things... You just may have to come up with solutions. Throwing the baby in a playpen at that age is not the answer. Have the dog in a room for some time, and the baby outside for sometime.. Alternating... Etc. Bring the kid out for walks..bring the dog out for walks. I can't see why a baby would have to spend so much time in a playpen. I had 3 kids 18 months apart.... Life didn't stop and I didn't stop making plans. Just had to get creative :)", "A baby who gets a lot of space at home will not be happy confined. She'll be screaming a lot (I've only done it for a day at a time when we had to be out - it was not good). She won't sleep well - because she hasn't used enough energy.  \nA space not being child proof is fine, with certain exceptions (stairs going down) - it just means you have to keep an eye on said baby at all times. Which you should probably do anyway, especially in an unfamiliar place. Mom and dad are going to have a tough time. Plus - baby being in an unfamiliar place (possibly different time zone, she said abroad) = bad sleep.\n\nI'm not sure who the AH is here (I do think her friends should be somewhat considerate and offer to leash the dog part of the time - it's not that hard), but it still sounds like a disaster of an idea.", "Could I ask if you have got children? Not because I want to tell you you shouldn't have an opinion on this but I want to avoid momsplaining things to you in case you do have children. \n\nMy guess is that you don't have kids or if you do that you are not the primary parent.", "This is the answer. Playpens for dogs are called exercise pens. She can bring along one of those, or a gate, or can plan to have the dog outside part of the day. But certainly a reasonable compromise is that dog and baby each have equal time to free range safely. If she's not willing to meet you halfway with a fair and reasonable solution like that, it's time to consider cancelling. As a dog owner, I'd have no problem whatsoever agreeing to that, even knowing our dogs are absurdly friendly and adore kids. Babies and dogs are both unpredictable, and don't know how to communicate to each other \"I mean you no harm\". So no matter how well behaved they all are, it's possible for something to go very wrong very quickly. She should be thinking not only about the baby's welfare but what could happen to her dog if (god forbid) there is a bite. Dogs can get euthanized for that. So keeping them separate is what's best for both families, not just yours.", "This is the way!", "Based on everything op has said, she's worried her baby will instigate an incident with the dog. That makes the baby the aggressor. The dog shouldn't be punished because the baby can't control themselves.", "A baby roaming around freely without being watched is also more dangerous than a free roaming dogs. The dogs won't fall over things, bump into sharp corners, end up under the feet of a drunk person.... there should be a compromise. Are dedicating a large area where things are save and comfy for a baby or an animal not a thing anymore? I've never had people over or been to other people's houses where there hasn't been a compromise. When kids come over they don't get to just roam the whole house and when people bring dogs over they keep them close to them or they explore the yard.", ">ESH for not discussing this BEFORE the house was booked. This is a recipe for disaster. Unless your friend is willing to crate the dog at times, or you\u2019re willing to put your kid in the playpen at times, this is not going to work out well. You can\u2019t let your guard down around your baby and a dog for even a second, especially a dog that isn\u2019t familiar with your baby.\n\nIt's not about being punished. And it's not like the dog can control itself (or it wouldn't bite even if it's hair was pulled).  \nWe're talking about two fairly similar creatures - dogs and toddlers have a lot in common.  \nThe fair thing would be to divide up the time they can both free range.  \nPlus - if baby doesn't get enough movement, she will be extremely cranky and everyone in the house will suffer.  \n\n\nBut in any case, this vacation sounds like a horrible idea.  \nIt's not like mom/ dad won't have to be chasing baby constantly - this is an unfamiliar place, not baby proofed, etc.  \nSomeone needs to have eyes on baby at any given moment baby is awake."]}
