You\u2019re sharing the space with other people and should keep her contained and safe. Your friends should have equal use of the space and honestly, how drunk are these adults going to get around your baby? Won\u2019t she be asleep when the heavy drinking takes place?

My current dog would *never* even get that far into his irritation, but he is a hurricane made of bricks and could knock over even a small adult if he gets a zoomie and doesn't pay attention to where he's going. (He's a year old, we're growing out of it) Even friendly dogs can accidentally hurt a baby, that's just a fact. \n\nOP is right to keep her baby separated even if she didn't have a fear. I really appreciate people keeping their children safe and away from dogs. I work in rescue, and if more humans were this vigilant my job would be a lot easier.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems like the friend specifically planned to be able to bring her dog and does not want to keep it put up for most of the trip. This I also understand, doggy day care at the last minute is expensive! Finding someone at the last minute to watch a loved animal can be a hassle.\n\nGet together, work on a schedule for the doggy crate/baby play pen that doesn't keep either too cooped up.

You or your husband are going to have to either hold her, watch her, or use a playpen all the time anyhow.", "Yeah, I rehab dogs for aggression and reactivity. I agree with everything you said except meeting the dog early. \n\nEven my dog at home, who is a giant baby man and would never hurt a fly, does not meet children unless they are over approx 7yo. Babies and toddlers have grabby little hands ages 3-6 are a crapshoot on how well they listen, and even a friendly dog can get to the point where they correct the behavior- which for dogs means a quick nip/teeth showing/shoulder check. \n\nThis correction on a puppy is appropriate and safe, that same correction on a human baby is dangerous. My current guy would never hold still long enough for a toddler to grab him, but he could accidentally knock the baby over in his greeting excitement.

Park, playground, fenced area. So many possibilities. I just don't see this as a black and white issue. Having a baby doesn't mean stop doing things... You just may have to come up with solutions. Throwing the baby in a playpen at that age is not the answer. Have the dog in a room for some time, and the baby outside for sometime.. Alternating... Etc. Bring the kid out for walks..bring the dog out for walks. I can't see why a baby would have to spend so much time in a playpen. I had 3 kids 18 months apart.... Life didn't stop and I didn't stop making plans. Just had to get creative :)", "A baby who gets a lot of space at home will not be happy confined.

She won't sleep well - because she hasn't used enough energy.  \nA space not being child proof is fine, with certain exceptions (stairs going down) - it just means you have to keep an eye on said baby at all times. Which you should probably do anyway, especially in an unfamiliar place. Mom and dad are going to have a tough time. Plus - baby being in an unfamiliar place (possibly different time zone, she said abroad) = bad sleep.\n\nI'm not sure who the AH is here (I do think her friends should be somewhat considerate and offer to leash the dog part of the time - it's not that hard), but it still sounds like a disaster of an idea.", "Could I ask if you have got children?

Playpens for dogs are called exercise pens. She can bring along one of those, or a gate, or can plan to have the dog outside part of the day. But certainly a reasonable compromise is that dog and baby each have equal time to free range safely. If she's not willing to meet you halfway with a fair and reasonable solution like that, it's time to consider cancelling. As a dog owner, I'd have no problem whatsoever agreeing to that, even knowing our dogs are absurdly friendly and adore kids. Babies and dogs are both unpredictable, and don't know how to communicate to each other \"I mean you no harm\". So no matter how well behaved they all are, it's possible for something to go very wrong very quickly. She should be thinking not only about the baby's welfare but what could happen to her dog if (god forbid) there is a bite. Dogs can get euthanized for that. So keeping them separate is what's best for both families, not just yours.", "This is the way!", "Based on everything op has said, she's worried her baby will instigate an incident with the dog. That makes the baby the aggressor.

I can tell you now it is going to be the week from hell. Here is why:\n\n1- 11 month old baby is not going to be happy. They are not going to be use to being confined. Babies don\u2019t sleep good anyway you add unfamiliar area to that will I can guarantee no adults will be sleeping. Plus you said their will be alcohol. Adults are not usually quite when drinking. So they will be waking up baby.\n\n2- dog is going to be running free. If the dog is not used to being kenneled he will be wining/barking. Keeping baby and everyone up. Dog is going to be in unfamiliar territory so they are already going to be anxious and bark at everyone and everything.\n\n3- adults are going to loose patients with baby and dog. Given the choice to go on vacation with the dog and the baby. I choose the dog(I have kids). I can ignore the barking. I can\u2019t ignore the crying all night. Even if the baby doesn\u2019t cry much now she will on vacation. Her routine, lack of sleep and strange noise will insure this.\n\n4- adults hungover with out sleep are not going to be happy.\n\n5- rental is not baby proof or dog proof. So someone is going to constantly be Hoovering over the dog and baby. Which will make for even more tired adults.\n\n6- every activity will pretty much have to be pet and baby friendly. You can leave the dog at home kenneled. (So at least baby friendly.)\n\nWho ever planned this vacation really didn\u2019t thing this threw.

You both need to confine your small impulsive being sometimes - get some baby gates, keep dog and kiddo seperated, alternate which one has more roaming space; or you need to not bring your kid on this trip. You are going to be nervous enough around a dog w drunk ppl, which will increase the chances if dog misbehaving (bc they react to nervousness). Bringing your kid w out a clear plan for alternating kid in playpen and dog babygated into kitchen is going to be a mess.", "I'm going ESH. \n\nYou have a dog and a baby in this scenario but no one thought about how these two entities are going to interact with each other on holiday before you booked the vacation home. Have the baby and dog even met before this? A lot of dogs feel uncomfortable around children, particularly if they haven't been socialized with them. Also it's never a good idea to let a baby that young and a dog interact without adult supervision, no matter how good or patient dogs are with babies (and a lot of them are far more patient with them then most humans).\n\nMy advice is to maybe have separate holidays until the baby is a bit older and maybe have some short play dates with the baby and the dog so the dog can get comfortable with the baby and you can start teaching the baby how to interact with the dog.", "ESH, for all the reasons everyone\u2019s mentioned. And as a person who has traveled extensively with young children from birth, I want to reiterate that you are not likely to enjoy this trip. You\u2019re likely going to need to watch the baby nonstop, because most houses are not childproof. Add in a bunch of drunk adults and a dog you\u2019re scared of, and I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re going. If you do go, though, I\u2019d say set a schedule. Dog\u2019s out when baby\u2019s napping, a couple blocks of time here and there where dog\u2019s out while your partner is taking care of baby. And I suggest it being your partner, not you, because your child will adopt your fear of dogs if you\u2019re exposing them to it.", "> I am terrified that my baby will pull on the dogs fur and get bitten or worse. As she is only little it is impossible to teach her how to act around animals in the next few weeks, especially since we don't have any dogs in our immediate family.\n\nESH\n\nI think it\u2019s unreasonable for Mel to expect you to confine your baby while her dog has run of the house. That\u2019s backwards. \n\nBut how small is this space anyway? A there no way for both to coexist without literally being on top of each other? Because I can tell you I have a big dog and a toddler, and her toddler friends all have medium/large dogs and we have been at playdates where there are 4 kids and 8 adults and we don\u2019t have big houses. \n\nThere is still enough space for none of the toddlers to ever have provoked a dog, because they are watched. Most of the time they don\u2019t even interact with the dog. And even when they do, some adult is always watching to make sure the interaction stays tame. Usually they\u2019re not interested in prolonged interaction anyway. Usually a pet, and they\u2019re off to do something else.\n\nSo in short, watch your kid. Watch the dog. This doesn\u2019t have to be a problem. People joke about how babies are fast but in truth they are not *that* fast. Have something entertaining near where you are sitting and let her play. If she is moving towards the dog, grab her and redirect her attention. \n\nIf you two are expecting to not have to watch your child very closely, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not responsible, dog or not. In a moment of inattention, your baby can pull a shelf down on herself. Not watching her IMO is not an option. Unless you put her in a playpen.

This is a you problem.  Most large dogs aren\u2019t a problem.  They will actively move away from a young child if it\u2019s bothering them.  You should be afraid of small aggressive dogs.", "Apart from the dog, I'd be worried about my friends being woken by a crying baby at 5am every morning of their holiday. And the baby sleeping through all-night loud voices & music. All sounds too stressful for a holiday.", "YTA.", "Lmfao a hurricane made of bricks.", "Of course the eyes of the parents would be all the time on the little one. But it won't help, when a pair of big dogs suddenly runs into the room, trampling the baby on their way. You're not as fast as the dogs are.", "I agree with you but they chose a vacation like this and agreed to have both the dogs and the baby around. The solution is for each person to watch the dependents they brought with them very closely, stick very close to them, and alternate who gets to be roaming freely which means OP should bring a playpen and the dog owners need to ensure their dogs can be secured. It sounds like a lousy time to me in general.", "I have two children, and I've never owned a dog.   However, I wouldn't have taken those children to a vacation with a dog before asking what the setup was, and if there was a way for the baby to play without the dog sometimes.", "That is your choice.  But she TRIED TO FIND A COMPROMISE with the dog owners.  She is NTA.", "So the baby's comfort is up to the parents but everyone must make sure that the dog is comfortable? How is that not a double standard?", "I feel like there's some info that would help a lot. Who, primarily, planned this vacation? Were you and your family \"added on\" to the plans, or was the vacation your idea? Was having a child present always in the plans, or has it changed the dynamic of the trip? It's really hard to determine whether you're in the wrong without this info. \n\nAll in all, it sounds like the communication has been very disjunctive. Maybe an ESH moment, because both you and your friends with the dog should have talked about this way earlier. I don't think your concerns are invalid, but it sounds like this should have been sorted out a long time ago.", "YTA leave the baby somewhere", "In my books, you're NTA.  \n\nIn my books, if a child and a dog can't occupy the same space, then the dog needs to get put in a pen, not the child.  Or the owners need to find a petsitter.", "ESH, As A parent I would not be comfortable with my Child crawling around a non baby proof space anyway. This sounds like it won't be a fun trip for you. You will spend the whole time worrying about Your baby, which is understandable At that age. I really think you should rethink the trip", "Don't force things, stay home and enjoy your baby.  Let the dog and the drinkers do what they want and party to their hearts content.  NTAH.", "Also it's a lot easier to get a dog to stop barking than to get a baby to stop crying.", "True.\n\nI'm not a super fan of OP's thinking of kids that age being unable to learn how to \"handle\" a pet (ie not hit, pull ears/fur/tail, etc). My sister has 2 kids, both of whom I taught how to interact with a pet (I've had various animals). When my niece was like 7 months or so, they were over at our house and she was super curious about my guinea pig. I took him out and held her hand and gently did the motion so that she could pet him, I also told her to be gentle. Following that, each time they were over, she was super careful when touching him, like he was made of glass almost. It was super cute to watch her show her brother when she was 4 (he was like 9 or 10 months) how he should pet my guinea pig. Of course I only let them pet him if I was around (often holding him, or he was sitting in my lap).", "Why are they bringing the dog on the vacation?  It's easier to board a dog than a baby, and parents need vacations too.", "Let's see, which is more annoying to a group of drunk people, a dog that just walks around, says hi, a lays down (as most big dogs do), or a screaming baby that you need to tip toe around half the day and constantly be worried about stepping on?", "Sure, but when you have a small child you have to accept that there are some things you can't take them to. A holiday with a group of adult friends with a large dog where no one else has small kids and everyone will be drinking and partying is not an appropriate holiday to bring your kid to.", "The solution was for these two families to go on separate vacations because their needs clearly aren't compatible. You can't bring a baby to an adult-centered, party/drinking type holiday and expect things to go smoothly.", "Maybe, but without the dog this definitely could have been possible.", "Also, a dog is less needy than a baby. You can leave a dog alone for a few hours if it has food and water and you put away anything it might destroy (if they're even the kind of dog to destroy stuff if you leave them alone). \nA large dog should also be well-trained enough to follow your commands most of the time. You can't tell a baby \"stop crying\" and expect them to obey.", "This sounds like a disaster in the making. You and your daughter are both going to be miserable. Can you pull out? All your holidays need to be child centred for the next 12 years.", "YTA.  A playpen is perfectly fine. This is a short trip, not a lifetime in one. Either that, or you don\u2019t go.", "NTA Doesn't sound like a good idea to go on this vacation. It sounds like an adults only kind of situation. Stay home and save the money for when your kid is older. Then you can get a baby sitter or do a family vacation.", "It\u2019s a vacay for the parents if they manage to get someone else to watch the baby even for a little bit.", "You don't get to complain about a baby being annoying when you knew the baby coming was part of the plan all along. If you don't want to accommodate a baby, don't plan a vacation that includes one", "Oh and personally, I'd rather spend my vacation snuggling my brothers newborn than deal with my sisters dog. The dog can stay home please bring the baby.", "OP literally said in the post she isn't going to be drinking, but you sure do want to be judgemental, huh?", "You could literally say the same thing about the dog", "Could you though? Was the dog coming along part of the plan from the beginning? Because OP seems pretty surprised that they don't have a plan to deal with the dog. And why should the dog get more consideration than a baby?", "YTA\nDon't go", "NTA, why cant the dog owner bring a large crate so the dog can be kept out of the child's way when necessary? Why is the child expected to live in a pen, and the dog allowed to roam free? What planet are these people from?\n\nEdit: to add - in fact, why are you going on this holiday? This whole thing doesn't sound good for the child?", "A week with a baby and a bunch of drunk adults and a huge dog you don\u2019t know well is a very bad idea. Why would you even consider this?", "But while doing all that, OP doesn\u2019t want to confine the baby to a playpen at all, and wants the kid to be able to crawl around freely like at home. There are ways that these things could be managed, but OP doesn\u2019t seem to want to even try.", "There is no such thing as a vacay when you take kids. You only have trips until they grow up.", "Yes, I agree with you. No one was thinking this through. Presumably, they're gonna go on it anyway, so the solutions have to be forward thinking rather than coulda-shoulda-woulda. Unless they can get refunds, I guess.", "**I will be the only one not drinking**\n\nSo according to OP daddy WILL be drinking hence my comment--not judgmental at all."]}
