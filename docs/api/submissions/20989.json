I haven't been on a date in over 10 years. I realized I don't ever want to have a family early in life because the realities of working full time are such that I don't want to have to put up with coming home just to put up with someone else's shit. That attitude hasn't changed. To this day there is nothing I look forward to after working all day or all week and not having someone at home. I like my peace and quiet and don't want anyone intruding on that.\n\nMy mother is Ukrainian and very traditional. We have been going back and forth for years about how I don't ever want a family and she just keeps trying to push it. I have been patient. I have been willing to calmly discuss. But she just hasn't wanted to drop it. So today I finally snapped.\n\nI finally told her that:\n\n\"I don't go to work for 40+ hours and 5 days a week to share my free time outside with anyone. That I did not put myself through university while working full-time to have to put up with sharing the life I built for myself with someone else. I put up with doing shit I don't want to do and that I don't like doing for no less than 5 fucking days a week. My weekends are mine to do my thing.\"\n\nThen I finally asked her the question that made her cry:\n\n\"Is this really what you had sex and had me for? So that I could fucking work my life away and then have to put up with even more chores at home having a family? What a thing to have written on my grave stone: \"Here lies u/biwinning_tigaa, spent his childhood trying to make his mother happy, spent his work making his bosses happy, spent his home life making his family happy. Too bad he never had any fucking time to make himself happy.\" \n\nBecause if that's the life that you really want for me I would have rather you aborted me.\"\n\n\nI don't feel bad. I meant what I said. It's a perfectly valid question. \n\nAm I The Asshole?", "created_utc": 1688138859, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n3ife/aita_for_asking_a_perfectly_valid_though_harsh/", "score": 699, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Try being nice and calm again? For what? Yeah it's mean, but its also totally honest. Hopefully she finally has it through her head.

Even if it is for you to be nice and polite, even if your parent is trying to influence & critizise YOUR choises for 10 Years! \n\nGuys, he was nice and polite for way to long. \n\nThat is not her place.

I've gotten pressured since I was *as young as 14 to have a big family to make my parents \"happy\"* and you know what? If it keeps happening despite standing my ground I'd blow up too.\n\nOp if you're reading this, your mother is way more childish for expecting you to throw away your life for something you don't want. Enjoy your life, but understand that the world revolves around the idea that everyone has to have a family and that you always have to be nice to your parents.\n\nI'm sure this was the result of years of pressure, good on you for possibly finally getting through to her, I completely understand how it feels when every single one of your conversations with a parent is \"when are you giving me grandkids??\"", "NTA. you have said time and time again that you don\u2019t want a family. it may have been harsh but hopefully you got through to your mum that you DO NOT WANT A FAMILY. everyone saying Y T A is silly, why should you have to keep going back and forth that you don\u2019t want a kids or a partner ? why should you have a family when you have stated that it would make you unhappy ? also people are saying you\u2019re unhappy the way you live your life now, as if they know you ! ofc you\u2019re going to come off annoyed on this post since it\u2019s AITA and you were obviously at your wits end.", "NTA, because I am in the same boat as you.  \nI am a young woman who has been indoctrinated all her life that it would be good for my mother to have grandchildren. No amount of honest talk and arguments helped to stop these conversations until I had to raise my voice almost to the point of scandal to get through to her. Besides, my brother has a child, but since she is not by blood, my mother doesn't consider her a granddaughter.   \nYes, my mother is from the same culture as yours, it's quite a traditional thing to pressure your children about new children.

The difference is when she tentatively asked me about getting a husband when I was in my mid twenties and I told her I was not interested whatsoever, to her credit she never mentioned it again.\n\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how frustrating it has been for you having her constantly bringing it up for 10 years, no wonder you had to be so ruthless.", "I mean NTA for being angry and even for the way you spoke. \n\nBut i think you have a weird idea of what family life is lol", "NTA.  A little harsh, to be sure...  but it sounds like it took going nuclear to get her attention.", "NTA since you\u2019ve had this conversation over and over and she refuses to listen to your wants in life.", "NTA because of overpopulation, we don't need more people in the world.", "Oof. Yeah that\u2019s harsh. But not unreasonable. I have said something similar to my mom, but less harsh. ,\u201dif you are so unhappy with your life, why do you want the same for me?\u201d I get zero questions regarding kids now.", "NTA. Parents need to stop having kids for grandkids. And family needs to respect the choices those children make. Instead of pestering them to expand themselves. \n\nMy mom did this when I had surgery to get my tubes out. She's got two grandkids she doesn't hang out with, doesn't do anything with, but I was \"denying her grandchildren\".

Not because you don't want a family.", "It's fine right up until that last sentence. Maybe a bit too far, but still NTA.", "NTA, and I think it must be hard for those who say you are to be such angels.\n\nIf you keep poking the bear then at some point that bear will snap.", "NTA. Sure you made your mom cry that probably felt not so great for you. \n\nBut sometimes you have to make mom cry because she isn\u2019t listening to you. You don\u2019t want a partner or a family. That\u2019s fine that\u2019s your life and your happiness. We don\u2019t have to understand or agree but we do have to respect that this is how you feel. Mom has to respect that too. \n\nI would suggest following up with an apology for speaking harshly to your mother BUT add that you are just so hurt by the way she keeps ignoring your happiness. That you love having time to yourself by yourself and you just don\u2019t want to change that and could she please respect the choice you\u2019ve made?\n\nFor many people it\u2019s hard to understand but my sister is exactly the same. She doesn\u2019t go out, she works and goes home to her three cats. I have to ask for permission for hugs because she hates them and only lets me when I\u2019m crying and really need comfort. I had to learn to respect her choices and feelings because I didn\u2019t understand them. Our relationship is super strong and she is my rock I can lean on when I need her. \n\nYes you were harsh with your mother and if you feel bad, do apologize. Just make sure you reinforce that you do not want a person in your life like that and that the more she presses for that the more hurt you are. I\u2019m sure she loves you and will come to understand. It may take a little time but she will get it. It might help if you share with her some of your me time hobbies that help you relax. So she knows you are actually happy.", "NTA\n\nI do comprehend others when they say that you told her it in a rude manner.\nBut it really was your last resort. It's the worst when one explains over and over again that one doesn't want to live their life the way another person would like to. Imagine parents overstepping your boundaries for freaking 10 years and they never shut up about it.", "Honestly NTA, your mom needs to stop pushing it. If you don\u2019t want a family, you don\u2019t want a family. Idk why everyone is saying you\u2019re the bad guy here\u2026 clearly it\u2019s upsetting to them that you\u2019re going against the societal grain haha live your life how you wanna live it.", "NTA. Yeah you were harsh but as a woman who decided to not have kids I get how annoying the questioning can be and the judgements you get. Maybe now though that you've gotten through to her how serious you are you can have a real convo about it.\n\nOTOH your view of a relationship as purely burden seems extreme. Can you consider that a partner could actually be an enhancement to your life rather than just a demand on your time and money?", "NTA. Your mother had plenty of opportunity to be respectful of you and drop it. Eventually getting annoyed with her endless badgering about trying to make you live YOUR life the way SHE wants is reasonable. \n\nYes, you were harsh. But sometimes harshness is necessary to get a point across to someone who refuses to hear it when it\u2019s framed gently.", "NTA. This sounds like build-up frustration from not having your arguments heard over and over again. You are free to choose the life you want and noone should pressure you to do otherwise.", "NTA. It was harsh, but you've tried for years to tell her calmly that isn't the life you want. She kept pushing the idea. It isn't your fault you told her how you felt.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems like she finally heard your point, that this life is yours to live as you see fit \u2014 not to live for someone else and what they want.\n\nShe finally heard your point *because* you used more intense language. Yeah, it probably hurt. That doesn\u2019t mean you were wrong or you were an asshole.\n\nThat being said, if you value your relationship with your mom it still might be worth it to apologize while staying firm in your boundary, something like: \n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for how I reacted during our discussion recently. In the future I\u2019ll try to use kinder language. However, I do want you to know how serious I am when I say it\u2019s intrusive and insensitive of you to keep asking when I\u2019m going to get married and have kids. Please don\u2019t do that anymore. If you do, I will either have to use harsh language again to reemphasize my point or I\u2019ll have to leave [set a boundary based on what your response will be]. I can\u2019t continue a conversation that has gone nowhere in the past 10 years. Can you respect that? I love you, and I know you care about me, but this is really important to me.\u201d", "NTA if she bugged you about this for a long time", "Nta. Sometimes we need to be harsh to get a point across. She obviously wasn't listening when you tried to be nice about it.", "NTA if you did bear with it for every day or most days for 10 years even after explaining every single time you are bound to snap at some point.Maybe she just believes you will change your mind one day if she keeps telling it ,but trust me it doesn't it really doesn't. Enjoy life by your life principles lol .", "NAH. I\u2019m baffled at how many people expect you to accept your mom\u2019s traditional views without expecting her to accept your non-traditional views. Yes, you were harsh. Yes, you\u2019re an adult. But so what? Adults are allowed to be frustrated too. I don\u2019t doubt any of us here hasn\u2019t blown up at a loved one at some point. It\u2019s not something to be proud of, but it happens. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious that your mom adores you and is looking out for you the best way she can. She cried not only because you were harsh, but because now she has to reconcile the fact that your life goals are different than the ones she had in mind for you. You\u2019ll both move past this.", "NTA, it was very harsh, but after 10 years of patiently explaining things, it\u2019s a wonder you didn\u2019t snap earlier. Still pretty harsh though, but hopefully it gets the point across. It\u2019s ok to be selfish in this life as long as you aren\u2019t negatively affecting others. And you not having kids, is not her business. Raising kids isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s goal, and people need to be ok with that.", "YTA- the things you said were intentionally harsh and meant to be hurtful to your mother. There are better ways to articulate your feelings.  \n\nHonestly you don\u2019t sound happy now, and while you have every right to live life on your terms, equating having a partner with guaranteed misery is not a healthy perspective.  \n\nYou might benefit from some therapy, work through those lingering issues from your childhood", "YTA\n\nI don't think I've read a post from someone so obviously unhappy, claiming that they are happy.\n\nYou don't seem to understand relationships. You do, however, seem to be very, very frustrated and angry.\n\nI think it would benefit you to talk to someone about this.", "ESH. You went a bit too far and you sound like an emotional teenager, but it also sounds like she just won't let it go when you've clearly expressed over and over that she needs to. So you've both had some a-hole behaviors that need to stop. She absolutely needs to respect the boundary that you're setting, and then on your end, you need to stop the emotional outbursts and instead tell her something like \"I've told you I will not discuss this issue any further. If you continue to bring it up, I will leave/go home/end the call/ask you to leave.\"\n\nInfo, do you still live with her? If so, it's definitely time for that to change", "Dude... what you need is therapy.\n\nYou're too angry and too resentful. Life is too short to spend living the way you're describing. And I'm not saying you should have a family, but you already seem miserable by your lone self. Do you want to keep on living miserably?", "A book that will be helpful to you is \u201cThe Five Things We Cannot Change\u201d by Richard Richo.", "Yes.\n\nThere is being truthful, and there is being verbally abusive, which you were.\n\nHope you feel better, now that you\u2019ve incinerated a human.", "YTA - You just described regular life. You don\u2019t have to have a relationship or a family, but saying your mom should have aborted you for having basic dreams that most parents have is a bit extreme.\n\nTbh your mom sounds very kind hearted. If my kid ever said this to me I would laugh and know I succeeded as a parent that they are so privileged they think regular life is unthinkable torture \ud83e\udd23\n\nBe grateful you have the opportunities you have to choose the kind of lifestyle you want.", "YTA\n\nLiterally no need to go off on your mother in such a way. If you think she's being an asshole for not dropping the family plan situation, you're equally an asshole for being so abrasive towards her in response.\n\nJust continue to tell her it's your decision and you're fine with it. The conversation doesn't need to continue after that. She doesn't have to agree, and she might not stop asking. I'd imagine (based on what I've read) she's doing so because she's worried that you're going to be lonely, perhaps a projection of her own feelings. She probably misses you, wants a reason to be closer to you, and sees family as an avenue for her to be more involved in your life again because that's what she values and knows.\n\nSometimes families aren't perfect, and I think you understand that given your reasoning for keeping your own time your own, but you're adding fuel to the fire with your response. It doesn't take much effort to be fair mannered to your family no matter if they do or don't deserve it.", "NTA maybe slight e s h. Your post resonates with me a bit but fortunately I didn't have to deal with the pestering for as long. I very much know what it's like to just want my peace and quiet, to be able to to what I do without having to fenagle around other people unless I choose to have friend time.\n\nI very deliberately chose my partner and let them into my life and made it clear from the get go I never wanted kids. I don't want to live another ~40 years if it's just going to be more struggling and suffering. But I digress, this isn't about me, it's about you.\n\nYou mightve gone a bit too far with the abortion line, probably could've stopped halfway through your rant and gotten the message across...but maybe not. Maybe apologize to your mom for being so harsh but she needs to stop bugging you about it.", "NTA.  Sometimes, you have to be harsh to get your point across where the other person finally  understand what you are saying. She doesn't have to like it. She has no choice but to accept it, though.", "YTA. I have an infant son and if he ever talks to me like this it would break my heart. \n\nYou are valid in your decision to not have a family - it\u2019s okay to not want those things. It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated because you\u2019ve told her you don\u2019t want to start a family before. What isn\u2019t okay, is you being a disrespectful dick. \n\nRelationships with parents aren\u2019t perfect, and maybe you and your mother have had a lot of issues in the past. Based off of your rude, hurtful, abrasive outburst, I would assume that\u2019s the case. You can choose to limit your interactions with her and you can uphold boundaries you need by being an adult and removing yourself from the situation. And you could have done all of that without intentionally hurting her.", "YTA.\n\nIt's your life and you should life it whatever way you want, man. But, you have to realize that this is a very, very unique way to live and it's not strange that your mother is curious about you not looking for a life partner. You're TA for saying rude things like 'I wish you aborted me', and taking all this excess anger out on her. You didn't ask her a question to get an answer; vented to her in the form of a question. I get that it's difficult to deal with a traditional parent who has certain expectations, and might never understand why you choose to live so very differently from her, though. But did she deserve to be yelled at and made to feel like it's her fault you're unhappy? No.\n\nYou say you like the way you live your life, and you don't need a partner or anyone else. But you also say that you are working your life away, and are spending all your time making other people happy. You don't need to get a family or whatever, but you do need to get something else that will make *you* happy. A lot of people work full time and don't feel this way.", "ESH\n\nYour mom needs to learn when to shut up and move on. She clearly doesn't respect boundaries and is set in her ways. You need to think of a healthy way to deal with it. \nBut you also need to handle yourself when you're angry. I understand the frustration of repeating the same thing over and over. But you don't say such things to people. Especially not to your mom. For you to insult something she (probably) cherishes (that being motherhood) and say she should've aborted you is a really shitty thing to do. Do better.\n\nYou're probably projecting off of your childhood and seeing the relationship dynamics you grew up witnessing. You're grasping so tightly to the whole \"worked to the bone\" narrative that it's getting ridiculous.\n\nI totally understand not wanting a family, but maybe your reasons are a lot deeper than just wanting to spend the weekends alone. It's a solvable issue that many couples are able to handle.\n\nHave you tried looking into the aromantic spectrum? Maybe even into associal behaviour?", "Not wanting a relationship or family is fine. Telling your mum to stop asking is fine. Even saying \u201cMum, every time you ask I\u2019m going to leave/ put the phone down, because we\u2019re just going in circles\u201d is fine. Using language that is purposefully hurtful does mean YTA. You\u2019re not a teenager yelling \u201cI wish I was dead\u201d any more", "ESH. She\u2019s acting like an overbearing asshole but that comment about abortion was pretty fucking harsh. Look up grey rock technique. \n\nSide note: have you looked up the aromantic/asexual spectrum? From what you describe, it sounds like you might find some insight there.", "Yikes.  I think I would drop kick my kid if he said that to me. That's your mother mister!  You already know that she is \"traditional.\"  I understand your predicament but perhaps next time just nod and smile when she is pushing instead of taking it to the level you did.  YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re a selfish little jerk with main character syndrome. The planet doesn\u2019t revolve around you. One thing we can agree on is that you shouldn\u2019t have kids as you\u2019d make a horrible parent, but dammit leave your poor mom alone and let her have her hope. That\u2019s not too much to ask.", "May I ask you a perfectly valid question or two:\n\n- Do you actually love or care for anyone but yourself?\n-Have you EVER loved your mother?\n-Do you expect your mother to keep having ANY Feelings for YOU after what you said?\n\nIf I were your mother O would count my losses and go No Contact. \n\nYTA, and I can only pray for Karma.", "What? How old are you?", "YTA. Your way of living is fine and it's fucked that your mom keeps invalidating that, but you sound absolutely miserable based on your posts and comments. That is not the way anybody should react to frustration to a parent they supposedly love. Even being pissed that's an unacceptable level. You didn't go to angry, you went to hateful and mean specifically to hurt her. That's messed up.", "YTA - just because you have this preconceived notion of marriage doesn\u2019t mean you have to walk around being an asshole.", "YTA. Telling your mum she should have aborted you is a big No, No. \n\nAnd also, you seem very dissatisfied with your life. I'd look into that because you don't sound happy at all. You don't have to date or get married or have a family but going through life with this level of frustration is very damaging.", "YTA for the irrational rant at your mother.  Agreed that staying single is the best play for you.", "YTA. Wow you sound bitter af. You don\u2019t want to spend anytime with anyone apparently. Not even friends it sounds like.

Yeah, AH. I thought my life would be similar and I managed to make my mom stop asking me. She may not be Ukranian, but the point remains.", "Thank goodness you don\u2019t want a family or SO. You sound like a fucking delight to be around. They would all be miserable.", "i think it's something deeper. you must take time off and focus on yourself. lie about a medical issue or whatever but just take time off.

One example: After years of pestering my spouse and I to have children, they did an about-face and told us we weren't ready to have them once we made a decision to start a family. They insulted us for every life decision we'd made in the past. They then doubled down when we tried to re-establish a relationship after going NC. However, through all of this shit, we never stooped to their level of pettiness, personal insults or over-the-top accusations. \n\nA simple \"no, we're going to have to agree to disagree on that, and I'm not discussing it further\" and then physically leaving the conversation if they aren't willing to drop it works wonders.

I haven't been on a date in over 10 years. I realized I don't ever want to have a family early in life because the realities of working full time are such that I don't want to have to put up with coming home just to put up with someone else's shit. That attitude hasn't changed. To this day there is nothing I look forward to after working all day or all week and not having someone at home. I like my peace and quiet and don't want anyone intruding on that.\n\nMy mother is Ukrainian and very traditional. We have been going back and forth for years about how I don't ever want a family and she just keeps trying to push it. I have been patient. I have been willing to calmly discuss. But she just hasn't wanted to drop it. So today I finally snapped.\n\nI finally told her that:\n\n\"I don't go to work for 40+ hours and 5 days a week to share my free time outside with anyone. That I did not put myself through university while working full-time to have to put up with sharing the life I built for myself with someone else. I put up with doing shit I don't want to do and that I don't like doing for no less than 5 fucking days a week. My weekends are mine to do my thing.\"\n\nThen I finally asked her the question that made her cry:\n\n\"Is this really what you had sex and had me for? So that I could fucking work my life away and then have to put up with even more chores at home having a family? What a thing to have written on my grave stone: \"Here lies u/biwinning_tigaa, spent his childhood trying to make his mother happy, spent his work making his bosses happy, spent his home life making his family happy. Too bad he never had any fucking time to make himself happy.\" \n\nBecause if that's the life that you really want for me I would have rather you aborted me.\"\n\n\nI don't feel bad. I meant what I said. It's a perfectly valid question. \n\nAm I The Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All my parents talked about with me for the next decade plus was when I was going to give them grandchildren. The Mister and I decided before we got married that neither of us wanted kids. We, like you, enjoy our free time and we really like money. Kids are not conducive to having either of those. \n\nSo, I told my parents before I even got married that I was never having kids. They kept saying \u201cYou\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d  We never did. They finally backed off when I informed them at age 35 that the Mister had gotten a vasectomy. That was the only thing that finally got them to realize that I meant what I said. \n\nI feel for you, but the way you worded your argument made you sound like a selfish prick.

Yuck", "I call bullshit on your happiness doing what you are doing now.\n\nI am also childless/partnerless by choice, and I can say with a lot of clarity that the amount of spite and bitchiness emulating from every word you type is not coming from someone that has a true understanding and is happy. \n\nI also have a mother that hounds me to get married and have kids, offered to pay to have my eggs frozen, makes up fake relationships to tell her friends that I am in, and so forth. You know how I handle it, knowing that I am happy in what I am doing and clear in what my desires are? \"I understand that it's hard to accept that I want such a different life than the life you have or pictured me to have, but I hope you can find some peace in the peace I am experiencing in my own life.\" \n\nYour response to your family, and the other people here, reeks of someone hiding from hurt. That's it. Maybe you do in the end want to be alone, and I obviously am not saying that it's impossible at all, but right now there is no real happiness in what you are doing if you act out like this."]}
