This wasn't the deal when you split the rent, I assume.  So she's responsible for the extra cost.  You can probably figure out her increased usage.  Just look at the usage from last year (not the amount you paid, but the usage) you can find it on the electric bill and you can get old bills online from the utility company.  If your habits haven't changed, then whatever the usage increased from last year is attributable to her.   So, if you're using 20% more electricity than last year during the same month, then she's responsible for an extra 20% of the electric bill.  If you haven't been living there for a year, average all the months you have been living there and use that.

Cause if she leaves it on when not using it, then she\u2019s an absolute monster and definitely the AH. \n\nSome electric companies offer a usage report that breaks down exactly how much went to lighting, cooking, heating water, etc. They also report on why it increased (like if it was due to higher usage or changes in the weather). You may want to see if yours offers that. \n\nNot sure where you live or if you have AC, but if it\u2019s in the Northern Hemisphere and you\u2019re in a summer climate using AC more now, it could maybe be cooling that\u2019s driving the increase. Not trying to say your roommate isn\u2019t being inconsiderate, but just trying to think of other possible contributors.", "LED lights are not going to break the bank. TVs are a different story. A hairdryer just being left plugged in isn't going to do much. If she is leaving it on I would consider getting her professional help. \n\nThe other reply to this comment is good. See if you can nail down usage. I live in the northeastern us and currently, people using AC are experiencing higher costs as a result. Also, we have been dealing with our electric company raising rates so it is more expensive regardless even without increasing usage. \n\nI am by no means saying that she is behaving appropriately. I do think it would help to have more data to back up your argument since she doesn't seem to understand how much of an impact her being home more is having.", "....she leaves the hair dryer ON? or plugged in? Because plugged in would be pennies if anything at all. None of this adds up to $150. It's the summer, if you live somewhere hot the bill goes up in the summer. Just natural. The things you're describing don't add up."]}
