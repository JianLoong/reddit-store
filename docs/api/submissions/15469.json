I know how I said it. This is very concerning.", "> Also, had I known, I would have eaten the sausage\" (she will eat things pork has touched, she just picks it off).\n\nThat's from later in OP's post - I also don't know anyone who doesn't eat pork but would be okay picking pork sausage off, but to each their own, especially since there's nothing in the post to indicate if it's religious, medical, or just a taste preference.", "This interaction doesn\u2019t feel like it needs to be parsed down to the point that you\u2019re offering her acceptable alternative responses. That is also condescending. She said she felt annoyed. I can see why she felt annoyed by your statement, especially since you\u2019ve outlined in the comments you have made needless statements about if the food she buys herself contained pork before. At some point, yes, you should accept that someone who religiously abstains from eating pork and has done so long before you ever met her knows how to feed herself. You are so focused on what she could have said differently to you that you haven\u2019t even considered that you could have said nothing at all. Or simply phrased what you said in the form of a question to sound less condescending. Again, regardless of your intention or tone she is telling you that\u2019s how it felt to her, and considering it\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve done it it\u2019s understandable that she would be annoyed. Why is she not allowed to feel how she feels about the things that you do, but you are allowed your feelings?\n\nRegardless, if you\u2019re at THIS point where simple interactions throw you for a loop to the point the require endless discussion, why are you even in this relationship? If that\u2019s how she is and other people know that\u2019s how she is, why are you trying to change her to make you more compatible? That\u2019s only something that works if both people are on board with making changes. She is telling you that she will not suppress her own feelings, which I think her feeling of annoyance is valid, to reassure you. So what outcome are you even looking for here? You want less anger in your life and she seems to want someone who lets her have her own feelings. Why parse it down to the point of also policing her words if what you\u2019re really doing is trying to make a round peg fit in a square hole? \n\nHow you\u2019re expressing yourself in the comments honestly just makes it seem like you want to be right and cannot entertain that you might not be.", "Yeah the deleted post and text log are eye opening", "I deleted that post because the abusive ex-husband in question, whom I've done everything within my power to block on all platforms, saw it and messaged me, downplaying the abuse he put me through and causing me to backtrack on years of progress in therapy, i have been having nightmares about it again ever since. I just want to clarify why that post was deleted. I blocked him, can he still access it? I am legitimately afraid of him. He threatened to kill me. He stalked me for years.\n\nI was not policing her diet. She's free to eat anything she wants. I just wanted to help stop her from eating something that I know would have upset her greatly.

Otherwise, why else qould she order it? That would have been a happy surprise to me.\n\nAlso, she downplays things after the fact.
