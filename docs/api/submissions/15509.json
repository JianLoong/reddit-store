She and her husband have initiated the divorce process and she said she doesn't want to stay alone right now, which I completely understand. It would be very hard to go from living with a partner to a completely silent house. \n\nI opened our home to her before I found out why her marriage didn't work out. Now that the two of us have had multiple conversations about it, I'm a little uncomfortable.\n\nThere was no infidelity. There was no big scandal. What she told me is that her husband wasn't having sex with her enough.\n\nThe things she has been saying have floored me. She says without sex, the two of them were basically just like roommates. She said she had been pushing for him to get a hormone imbalance test done because while they were still having sex, it wasn't enough. She said he had begun resisting even normal touches from her because from his perspective, all she thought about was sex which apparently isn't true... I'm not sure I believe that. I can elaborate in the comments but overall it just left me feeling sad for her ex and the disrespect of saying sex is the only thing that separates a partner from a roommate. Not even a friend.\n\nI've done my best to be supportive, but I can't relate to the thought process at all. If my partner told me tomorrow that he wasn't up for sex for the next few weeks, months, or longer, I would just take care of myself and respect that. I love him and I want him to be the person I do life with forever. \n\nThis all came to a head last night. My husband and I were having a typical lazy Saturday night, catching up on some shows and chatting while we lounge on the couch. His legs were in my lap and I was kind of absentmindedly massaging his feet and rubbing his ankles. This was an innocent gesture. My sister came in, saw me doing it, and made a joke along the lines of \"Ah, OP, I didn't know you were into feet\" or \"I didn't know you had a foot fetish.\" The exact wording escapes me.\n\nI couldn't help but feel put off at her sexualizing the gesture. Intimacy CAN be sexual, but it doesn't have to be. I told her so, and then said, referring to her divorce, \"You sexualizing every interaction is why you're in the situation you are now.\" She called me a dick and left the room.\n\nI already know it was a little harsh, but I'm unsure if it was tough love or too much. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682269535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wicg4/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_a_comment_she/", "score": 1714, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

ESH.\n\nIt was probably your honest assessment of what happened based on what she told you, but that's precisely why it was very unkind to throw that in her face because she offended you with her dumb, crass joke. She shared her issues with her marriage probably thinking it would be safe to do so with you. You may be uncomfortable with her issues, but I don't think she'd have shared with you if she expected you'd judge her and use it against her that way. \n\nApologize for the remark and let her work out her issues with a counselor from now on. I'm sure she'll appreciate that it's inappropriate/uncomfortable to make weird sex jokes about your sibling in front of their partner, but you also need to clear up that you're not shaming her for having a high sex drive.", "Info: Did she ever try to coerce her partner for more intimacy? Seems like we're missing some context if he started recoiling at her touch. That's a huge reaction that doesn't just pop out of nowhere.\n\nHonestly sexual incompatibility happens in relationships. Sometimes one partner has a high libido and the other has next to no libido. Neither are in the wrong and both are valid reasons for ending the relationship. Your sister isn't in the wrong just for having a high sex drive.", "ESH. It\u2019s weird that your sister made a comment that sexualized her brother. That\u2019s fucking strange. \n\nHowever, why did you have to bring her failed marriage into it? She confided in you, you didn\u2019t agree, and you threw it in her face. There are so many ways you could have expressed your concerns about her reasons for her divorce without attacking her.", "Esh - her comment was entirely uncalled for, commenting on how other people express intimacy almost always is. \n\nBut she's perfectly within her rights to not feel sexually satisfied and to want to leave a situation because of it. It doesn't make her a bad person and you a good person, how you'd each deal with a lack of sex. She's not cheating on him, she's not forcing him to be more sexual from what I can tell. She's handling this the way any unsatisfied person in marriage should, by letting the relationship end. \n\nYou deciding to bring her marriage into is was uncalled for when a simple \"don't comment on our intimacy please\" would do. You decided to hurt her simply because you can't relate to her.\n\nYou're also basing your feelings on an imaginary situation where the person you love is in a situation where they can't have sex with you for a reason. \n\nShe was in a situation where nominally everything was average, and she recognized that she wasn't getting enough sex to be satisfied and that it wasn't going to change...\n\nApples and oranges", "Yeah, you are a bit YTA. It really disturbs me that there are people who think that sex isn't important in a relationship because for a majority of couples, it is a very important aspect. If sex is one of her love languages, not being able to express that openly with the person who is supposed to love and support her can be a dessimating rejection. \n\nIf he's not even willing to touch her, that's a problem. If she's to the point where she wants him to go to the doctor, there is a bigger issue. This does not sound like a case where she's hyper sexual. It sounds like she's feeling neglected and rejected by her husband. It sounds like she has a healthy sex drive, and there is something potentially wrong with her husband( whether that be hormones, mental health, or an affair), especially if this is a drastic change from normal. If he's refusing to even find out if there is a medical issue, then yes, the issue is him. Stop slut shaming your sister for wanting her relationship to be healthy.", "That was probably a good moment to show her that not every intimate moment has to be sexual, which was probably your goal as well, but bringing up her divorce so soon after it happened is kind of an asshole move.\n\nBesides, she moved in because she wanted to feel safe and away from her divorce. I get that you had good intentions, but I hope you understand how something like that can hurt your sister. YTA", "YTA. A dead bedroom is absolutely a reason for relationship incompatibility. It sounds like you\u2019re judging her for the fact that she values sex as part of a relationship. You\u2019re different people and can have different values.

She made a slightly edgy but harmless joke, and you hit the BIG RED BUTTON right out the gate. \n\nI get that there\u2019s subtext here with her sexual stress, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re her brother, not her therapist. If you thought the joke was inappropriate, simply letting her know that should\u2019ve sufficed.", "NTA.

You probably could've been nicer but that's a weird thing to say", "Holy shit YTA.\n\nShe made a slight joke, maybe one you found offensive. From my perspective, this is a light tease.\n\nThen you proceeded to go nuclear and used something your sister told you in a moment of vulnerability just to hurt her. She's going through a traumatic experience, she probably feels a ton of self confidence issues because her husband was, \"resisting even normal touches from her,\" and you proceeded to pour lava into the wound.

If your sister was continuously making comments like that then I would snap too.", "YTA first for judging your sister's reason for divorce & second for your comment to her.  Touch & sex are a vital part of intimacy in a marriage.  It's part of the connection.  It's one thing when there is a medical reason.  But just because your partner doesn't want you, it can damage your self esteem & certainly the relationship.  I've been there.  And until you are, you really should keep your judgement to yourself.  Because while you may think you'd know how you would feel, you are wrong.  Second, she made a joke, a pretty innocuous one & you went straight to AH.", "ESH \n\nThe way this post is written does have her coming off as hyper sexual, but how much of that is because you only heard her side of the story about her divorce and then let your thoughts run away I wonder.\n\n I understand her comment rubbing you the wrong way but a firm 'not every touch is sexual sis' would have been adequate. Making it seem as though her marriage ending is her fault alone was hurtful and unnecessary. \n\nWere it me, I would apologize and then set boundaries about the type of language used to discuss myself and my partners actions in our home.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should consider therapy.", "NTA.\n\nA similar reaction was bound to happen. It's one thing if you keep your mouth shut when she is talking about these issues and judging her own scenario, but once she starts projecting it onto you and your husband she's going too far. And if you didn't nip it in the bud then, she probably would have escalated.\n\nIt honestly sounds like the husband already had Walkaway syndrome probably due to many other factors of the marriage and your sister is using the lack of sex as the only reason to excuse accepting her faults in the relationship. As you said, it is sad. There was either never a foundation other than sex in this relationship, or the foundation was destroyed by different issues entirely and your sister just can't admit that to herself or anyone else.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t judge her reasons for the split. Not your biz, dear. She shouldn\u2019t be weighing in on your relationship with your husband and what you do together. Let this go.", "NAH. She's not wrong for wanting a relationship with physical intimacy. You are content with long periods of non-intimacy. This is teetering on a light YTA if you push this any further. You've shared your opinion. Now back off.", "NTA. It was a frank comment, but I don\u2019t read intended cruelty or malice into it. If she was hurt, an apology/explanation is in order.", "NTA. My husband and I have the same perspective. She needs therapy.", "ESH. What you said was cruel but given the context of the way she framed her divorce, it was probably something she needed to hear. It definitely didn\u2019t need to be said in that way but it\u2019s weird to see something your sibling is doing and immediately sexualize it. With how comfortable she was with just saying it, it makes sense why her ex partner would recoil at even normal touches. Her first instinct was to make a sexual joke. It\u2019s not a huge leap to assume her ex partner was uncomfortable with how much she thought about sex, joked about.. etc. Anyways, ESH. You for saying it in the way you did and her for even saying it.", "NTA kick her out", "NTA.  Your perceptions of the situation your sister is in are yours, and while they might not be 100% on point, there is a chance that both her and her partner need counseling.

For example me and my gf if she has never said a thing about me gaming even though we lived together and once we married she is constantly on my ass about gaming that can put a strain on the marriage. While in this case your sister hasn\u2019t been receiving the amount of sex she would like.\n\nThere needs to be more context or information to truly say whether or not your sister is justified. For all we know they used to do it 24/7 and now they do it once a month. The thing that makes you an asshole is that you\u2019re making a leap that everything about her relationship is sexual. It could very well be that it\u2019s just been a major strain on the relationship and that leads to other problems since now she\u2019s probably in a mood because her needs aren\u2019t being met and anything can set her off. \n\nIf you think about it you and your husband are just really good friends that have sex on occasion who love each other a great deal.

It's ok if sex isn't important for you but it doesn't mean that has to be the same for everyone. If your partner suddenly doesn't want to have sex with you without and gives you no reason,  this isn't about taking care of yourself an letting it go, you are in marriage this affects both of you. \n\nYour sister just made a joke and you are acting prude and riding your moral high horse to the sunset.", "I don't think there was any direct coercion, at least from what she's told me. She said she was feeling very rejected because she was trying to initiate a lot and he wasn't receptive except for about once a week, and that she would drop it without pressing him after he gave non-verbal 'I'm not into it' cues or said no.\n\n(However I do find the line between coercion and expression desires to be particularly fine in situations like these. In my past experiences with break ups, there are usually multiple conversations leading up to the main event that take place. How do you properly initiate a conversation where the main takeaway is \"if you don't start sleeping with me x times a week, I'm leaving\" without it sounding at least a little bit like coercion?  I don't know. I think I would be more forgiving if this was a dating break up and not a marriage one, since these problems have occurred their entire relationship past the first few months apparently.)\n\nEDIT: Changed some wording to clarify the two of them were seemingly having sex about once a week.

This does not sound like a case where she's hyper sexual.\n\nOP says the sister and her husband were still having sex once a week. That's hardly \"you need a doctor because there's something wrong with you\" territory. If she's not satisfied she's well within her rights to walk away, but acting like her husband is abnormal for it is a problem. My sister's ex treated her this way and she told me that the more he asked (i.e. demanded) sex was the less willing she was to concede because it came to feel like a chore. If she gave in, he'd just ask for it even more often and she said \"why would you want to have sex with someone who treats you like that?\"\n\nOP also says the sister said without sex the husband was basically a roommate -- 1. they *were* having sex still, but 2. it sounds like sex was the only thing holding the marriage together, and that I think is what OP has a problem with.\n\nThere's more to the sister's relationship than the surface story, and just based on OP's comments, the sister has some issues with how she treated her partner.", "Mostly agree, but giving your spouse a foot rub being sexual (sisters \"joke\") seems to have made OP feel like she's turned something innocent they used to share into something kinky.", "> Stop slut shaming your sister for wanting her relationship to be healthy.\n\nExactly.", "It seemed like a joke.

That makes PA the asshole. \n\nAnd in your specific situation, We don't know PAs libido, we don't know if there's a medical or emotional reason they're not interested in the amount of sex PB wants, we don't know how PB has been handling it, we don't know how clearly the two have communicated...

And she didn't even seem to offer other things that are necessary in a marriage considering sex was the only thing dividing them from being roommates.

Imagine experiencing some form of emotional blow, like a family member dying, or being let go from a job you put your heart and soul into, or just...not feeling happy for some reason because hormonal balances be weird sometimes, and all your partner can offer as support is a roll in the sack. Not a hug, not pat on the back, not kind words or conciliatory gestures like that.

Yes. Was it exactly what people should be telling her, that her over sexualization of everything has poisoned her relationships and is driving people out of her life? Also yes.

It wasn't until my partner started a support group and realized how he was hurting me, and made changes, that our sex life began to change and improve.

You say you were trying to do \"tough love\", but it really sounds more like you got defensive and attacked her in response to the comment that made you uncomfortable.\n\nHonestly, the fact that your sister shared the intimate details of her marriage with you shows me that she trusted you. She confided in you over the most personal and intimate aspect of her life. You maybe could have had a serious conversation with her to see if she was sure about the divorce. I honestly don't think it would have been your business even then, and she would have been well within her rights to ask you to drop it....but maybe she would have been willing to listen.\n\nNow, though, you've shown her that you are willing to attack her with all the most painful things she's shared with you.

It\u2019s true. If sex is not there that\u2019s 80% of your relationship in trouble. I would tell people all the time we\u2019re just glorified roommates. It\u2019s been 6 years now and I can promise you, I wasn\u2019t the one with the problem. I\u2019m in a very happy and healthy relationship.

Though I might still apologize/definitely talk.\n\nI may have a biased perspective (we all do but whatever) because I've often been the partner who was the least sexual in my relationships. No known hormone imbalance, explicitly, but dealing with things like depression, dysmorphia and dysphoria and sexual trauma PLUS being somewhere on the ace spectrum lol.\n\n(Also its at least anecdotally seen in ADHD too, which I also have - time is weird, so to me we just had sexy like, earlier this week or last but in truth? 3+ months.)\n\nFor me, a lot of the time, its just... So not a priority. And its okay if it is for someone, and sometimes it's just amatter of incompatibility then, but I will also say I think in general there's so might wright and importance put on sex in relationships.\n\nIn a surprising twist *I've* hit a point with my partner where I am more interested in sexual activity than them rn. Who can say why. As long as they are okay, I'm fine with that, we chat and check in, and I'm an adult who can handle my own needs as, well, needed. If I'm worried its because they aren't interested or its otherwise affecting my body image and self.esteem, I can both acknowledge that is not their responsibility AND talk to them about it: because again, be an adult, own your own brain and body.\n\nYour sister isn't TA for having needs exactly, and I also know that kind of joke to be made goofily between friends, but I think in the wider scale of things she does need perspective and like, therapy might not be awful if she's taking suggestions.

Ending it is actually the way more healthy option for everyone involved rather than resorting to coercion to get what one party wants, or giving up on feeling sexually fulfilled entirely. That\u2019s great that YOUR relationship wouldn\u2019t feel like a roommate situation if you stopped or greatly reduced the amount of sex you were having, but again, your relationship is not her relationship. There was no need to effectively slut shame your sister for wanting a satisfying sex life.", "Soft YTA.\n\nSounds like she does think that any contact is sexual in nature. As others have said, intimacy comes in many forms and at different \"levels\". Sometimes a back rub is a precursor to sex. Other times, it's to help a poor tired person with a baseball sized knot in their back get some relief so they can sleep. I gave my ex wife hundreds of 1/2 hour massage therapy sessions attacking her vicious knots (in those two spots) knowing it was a gesture of kindness and not an invitation to initiate sex.\n\nBut back to her husband. A person shutting down intimacy is not really that great, even when there is a valid reason for it. People sign up for monogamy, not celibacy. It was usually the men who complained of this as women tend to shut down sexually a lot quicker if the emotional side of their relationship is wanting. \n\nBut now, more and more women are reporting a problem with a sexless marriage. I mean, this fellow didn't want to be even touched by her. His extreme revulsion for touch and basic intimacy could have different causes. With men, it can be a serious lack of libido and loss of self-esteem. Could be because of employment issues or her having an affair. It can result in  him being completely averse to anything remotely sexual. Then there is the porn addiction problem which is well known for men to because autonomic voyeurs incapable with being attracted to, and bonding with, their own female partners.\n\nI wouldn't say this woman caused her marriage to fail - it's not fair. But, she does have some strange attitudes about sex and intimacy and maybe she was PART of the problem with her husband.

I can't even connect the dots between her sexless marriage and the comment she made and where your comment came from. I only say YTA because that's the only one that fits - it does seem like your sister was making a joke that you took the wrong way, which is well within your rights and boundaries. You should have said it was wrong to your sister and you don't like it or appreciate it - not say that's why her marriage failed. I don't know the context of your relationship though. \n\nHowever, considering lack of sex and intimacy was an issue in her marriage and probably on her mind, it could have been the reason why she even said that. Sorry, since I realize this is your sister, but she might be sexually frustrated and those are the type of people who do sexualize things a lot. So maybe you weren't wrong but the context is key here, I suppose.", "YTA. I was in a long term relationship where my boyfriend only wanted sex once a week, if that, and then proceeded to also tell me that I was too sexual because I wanted to give him a hug or kiss when I'd come home from work or school. It is extremely damaging to be in a relationship where you want to physically express love or intimacy, and then you're told that you're too sexual. It was only sex on his terms, never mine, and it sounds like your sister experienced something similar. Your sister will likely be dealing with the fall out of this experience emotionally for years to come, especially if she was made to feel like that bad guy simply for wanting to be sexually intimate with her husband. \n\nShe made an off base joke, you went in to hurt her with your response.", "YTA- Sister was making a little joke and you took it to far.

As we don't all live in a perfect world, truth was spoken with hesitation.", "NTA. You're right.", "NTA\n\nShe does need to understand that not all intimacy = sex. It does seem like her husband stopped wanting to be intimate with her in general, though. Not just sex. That's just off of what you're saying. I may be reading into it, but it seems like he's got an intimacy issue and she can only identify it as sex, and may be missing all of the other signs that were there before that. \n\nEither way, she likely deserved that comment and needs to learn that a relationship is built on a lot more than just sex.", "NTA.

And let's face it; reverse the genders and have a man saying that his wife doesn't pull her weight in the bedroom, calling her a roommate, and pushing her to go to the doctor, among other things, he'd be rightfully flamed out.

Your sister should be meeting with a therapist; it's not a foregone conclusion that she's over sexualizing anything, and it's pretty hard to make that statement without asserting your own subjective judgement or preference on someone else.  For some reason people think that's crazy to do when it comes to their favorite flavor of ice cream, but they're comfortable with it when it comes to sex.\n\nSo let's lay the cards on the table; your sister has made a major life decision to end her marriage while asserting her sexual needs which for people in general is a little difficult and taboo and I would Hazzard a guess that for women it's even worse.  If she's an actual, normal human being I can guarantee that even if the decision is final she's still wrestling with self-doubt and guilt on some level, questioning her needs and wants and trying to unravel the very, very complicated feelings that people have about love and sex and relationships.\n\nAnd then you, her brother, someone she has trusted as a confidant, the person she came to in order to not be alone in this difficult time, told her it's all her fault.\n\nSo, does that sound like a good idea in hindsight?  I think it might be strongly worded to call you an asshole, but I do think you owe her an apology.\n\nIf you want to be really supportive, stand behind her decision, realize that you don't have to understand her to do that, nor do her needs and wants have to make sense to you, and encourage her to meet with a counselor to work through her feelings if she isn't already.", "YTA.

You don't get flinching in people at random, it generally doesn't come from nothing, and more than likely in his case it's because he knew most touch from her came only when she wanted sex. Additionally, she assumed just from a glance at her brother giving his husband a foot rub that it was a sexual thing. Plus, there are her other actions such as acknowledging she saw him as little more than a roomate when they weren't screwing, and pressuring him to get medical testing just to see if he wasn't defective or something, because it's impossible he could just...not be as sexually active as her.

If the genders were reversed the sister would be judged on those two points alone. She would be seen as a creep at best, and a predator at worst because of her actions towards her husband. Instead, we have people going, \"we don't know enough, and it's perfectly ok for them to break up over the sexual incompatibility,\" when the incompatibility is not what's being discussed, it's how she dealt with that incompatibility.
