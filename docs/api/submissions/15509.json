{"id": 15509, "submission_id": "12wicg4", "title": "AITA for telling my sister that a comment she made is exactly why her marriage crashed and burned?", "selftext": "My sister has been staying with my husband and I (men in our late 20s) for the last week and some change. She and her husband have initiated the divorce process and she said she doesn't want to stay alone right now, which I completely understand. It would be very hard to go from living with a partner to a completely silent house.\n\nI opened our home to her before I found out why her marriage didn't work out. Now that the two of us have had multiple conversations about it, I'm a little uncomfortable.\n\nThere was no infidelity. There was no big scandal. What she told me is that her husband wasn't having sex with her enough.\n\nThe things she has been saying have floored me. She says without sex, the two of them were basically just like roommates. She said she had been pushing for him to get a hormone imbalance test done because while they were still having sex, it wasn't enough. She said he had begun resisting even normal touches from her because from his perspective, all she thought about was sex which apparently isn't true... I'm not sure I believe that. I can elaborate in the comments but overall it just left me feeling sad for her ex and the disrespect of saying sex is the only thing that separates a partner from a roommate. Not even a friend.\n\nI've done my best to be supportive, but I can't relate to the thought process at all. If my partner told me tomorrow that he wasn't up for sex for the next few weeks, months, or longer, I would just take care of myself and respect that. I love him and I want him to be the person I do life with forever.\n\nThis all came to a head last night. My husband and I were having a typical lazy Saturday night, catching up on some shows and chatting while we lounge on the couch. His legs were in my lap and I was kind of absentmindedly massaging his feet and rubbing his ankles. This was an innocent gesture. My sister came in, saw me doing it, and made a joke along the lines of \"Ah, OP, I didn't know you were into feet\" or \"I didn't know you had a foot fetish.\" The exact wording escapes me.\n\nI couldn't help but feel put off at her sexualizing the gesture. Intimacy CAN be sexual, but it doesn't have to be. I told her so, and then said, referring to her divorce, \"You sexualizing every interaction is why you're in the situation you are now.\" She called me a dick and left the room.\n\nI already know it was a little harsh, but I'm unsure if it was tough love or too much.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I appreciate everyone's recommendation, but I do not like the deadbedrooms sub.

ESH.\n\nIt was probably your honest assessment of what happened based on what she told you, but that's precisely why it was very unkind to throw that in her face because she offended you with her dumb, crass joke. She shared her issues with her marriage probably thinking it would be safe to do so with you. You may be uncomfortable with her issues, but I don't think she'd have shared with you if she expected you'd judge her and use it against her that way. \n\nApologize for the remark and let her work out her issues with a counselor from now on. I'm sure she'll appreciate that it's inappropriate/uncomfortable to make weird sex jokes about your sibling in front of their partner, but you also need to clear up that you're not shaming her for having a high sex drive.", "Info: Did she ever try to coerce her partner for more intimacy? Seems like we're missing some context if he started recoiling at her touch. That's a huge reaction that doesn't just pop out of nowhere.\n\nHonestly sexual incompatibility happens in relationships. Sometimes one partner has a high libido and the other has next to no libido. Neither are in the wrong and both are valid reasons for ending the relationship. Your sister isn't in the wrong just for having a high sex drive.", "ESH. It\u2019s weird that your sister made a comment that sexualized her brother. That\u2019s fucking strange. \n\nHowever, why did you have to bring her failed marriage into it? She confided in you, you didn\u2019t agree, and you threw it in her face. There are so many ways you could have expressed your concerns about her reasons for her divorce without attacking her.", "Esh - her comment was entirely uncalled for, commenting on how other people express intimacy almost always is. \n\nBut she's perfectly within her rights to not feel sexually satisfied and to want to leave a situation because of it. It doesn't make her a bad person and you a good person, how you'd each deal with a lack of sex. She's not cheating on him, she's not forcing him to be more sexual from what I can tell. She's handling this the way any unsatisfied person in marriage should, by letting the relationship end. \n\nYou deciding to bring her marriage into is was uncalled for when a simple \"don't comment on our intimacy please\" would do. You decided to hurt her simply because you can't relate to her.\n\nYou're also basing your feelings on an imaginary situation where the person you love is in a situation where they can't have sex with you for a reason. \n\nShe was in a situation where nominally everything was average, and she recognized that she wasn't getting enough sex to be satisfied and that it wasn't going to change...\n\nApples and oranges\n\nEta I also find the comments crying about reversing it to be peak aita behaviour - this question is about how op behaved towards his sister. We know less than op and OP doesn't appear to know much of anything about the relationship. Throwing the failed relationship in her face in retaliation to a bad joke is unreasonable.", "Yeah, you are a bit YTA. It really disturbs me that there are people who think that sex isn't important in a relationship because for a majority of couples, it is a very important aspect. (ETA Because I think a lot of people are misunderstanding me. When I say that sex is important, I don't mean that it should be THE priority. I mean whether you want little sex, a lot of sex, or no sex at all, sex is still important and important to be discussed beyween partners) If sex is one of her love languages, not being able to express that openly with the person who is supposed to love and support her can be a dessimating rejection. \n\nIf he's not even willing to touch her, that's a problem. If she's to the point where she wants him to go to the doctor, there is a bigger issue. This does not sound like a case where she's hyper sexual. It sounds like she's feeling neglected and rejected by her husband. It sounds like she has a healthy sex drive, and there is something potentially wrong with her husband( whether that be hormones, mental health, or an affair), especially if this is a drastic change from normal. If he's refusing to even find out if there is a medical issue, then yes, the issue is him. Stop slut shaming your sister for wanting her relationship to be healthy.", "That was probably a good moment to show her that not every intimate moment has to be sexual, which was probably your goal as well, but bringing up her divorce so soon after it happened is kind of an asshole move.\n\nBesides, she moved in because she wanted to feel safe and away from her divorce. I get that you had good intentions, but I hope you understand how something like that can hurt your sister. YTA", "YTA. A dead bedroom is absolutely a reason for relationship incompatibility.

From my perspective, this is a light tease.\n\nThen you proceeded to go nuclear and used something your sister told you in a moment of vulnerability just to hurt her. She's going through a traumatic experience, she probably feels a ton of self confidence issues because her husband was, \"resisting even normal touches from her,\" and you proceeded to pour lava into the wound.

Touch & sex are a vital part of intimacy in a marriage.  It's part of the connection.  It's one thing when there is a medical reason.  But just because your partner doesn't want you, it can damage your self esteem & certainly the relationship.  I've been there.  And until you are, you really should keep your judgement to yourself.  Because while you may think you'd know how you would feel, you are wrong.  Second, she made a joke, a pretty innocuous one & you went straight to AH.", "ESH \n\nThe way this post is written does have her coming off as hyper sexual, but how much of that is because you only heard her side of the story about her divorce and then let your thoughts run away I wonder.\n\n I understand her comment rubbing you the wrong way but a firm 'not every touch is sexual sis' would have been adequate. Making it seem as though her marriage ending is her fault alone was hurtful and unnecessary. \n\nWere it me, I would apologize and then set boundaries about the type of language used to discuss myself and my partners actions in our home.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should consider therapy.", "NTA.\n\nA similar reaction was bound to happen. It's one thing if you keep your mouth shut when she is talking about these issues and judging her own scenario, but once she starts projecting it onto you and your husband she's going too far. And if you didn't nip it in the bud then, she probably would have escalated.\n\nIt honestly sounds like the husband already had Walkaway syndrome probably due to many other factors of the marriage and your sister is using the lack of sex as the only reason to excuse accepting her faults in the relationship. As you said, it is sad. There was either never a foundation other than sex in this relationship, or the foundation was destroyed by different issues entirely and your sister just can't admit that to herself or anyone else.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t judge her reasons for the split. Not your biz, dear. She shouldn\u2019t be weighing in on your relationship with your husband and what you do together. Let this go.", "NAH. She's not wrong for wanting a relationship with physical intimacy. You are content with long periods of non-intimacy. This is teetering on a light YTA if you push this any further. You've shared your opinion. Now back off.", "NTA. It was a frank comment, but I don\u2019t read intended cruelty or malice into it. If she was hurt, an apology/explanation is in order.", "NTA. My husband and I have the same perspective. She needs therapy.", "ESH. What you said was cruel but given the context of the way she framed her divorce, it was probably something she needed to hear. It definitely didn\u2019t need to be said in that way but it\u2019s weird to see something your sibling is doing and immediately sexualize it. With how comfortable she was with just saying it, it makes sense why her ex partner would recoil at even normal touches. Her first instinct was to make a sexual joke. It\u2019s not a huge leap to assume her ex partner was uncomfortable with how much she thought about sex, joked about.. etc. Anyways, ESH.

It could very well be that it\u2019s just been a major strain on the relationship and that leads to other problems since now she\u2019s probably in a mood because her needs aren\u2019t being met and anything can set her off. \n\nIf you think about it you and your husband are just really good friends that have sex on occasion who love each other a great deal.

It's ok if sex isn't important for you but it doesn't mean that has to be the same for everyone.

She said she was feeling very rejected because she was trying to initiate a lot and he wasn't receptive except for about once a week, and that she would drop it without pressing him after he gave non-verbal 'I'm not into it' cues or said no.\n\n(However I do find the line between coercion and expression desires to be particularly fine in situations like these. In my past experiences with break ups, there are usually multiple conversations leading up to the main event that take place. How do you properly initiate a conversation where the main takeaway is \"if you don't start sleeping with me x times a week, I'm leaving\" without it sounding at least a little bit like coercion?  I don't know. I think I would be more forgiving if this was a dating break up and not a marriage one, since these problems have occurred their entire relationship past the first few months apparently.)\n\nEDIT: Changed some wording to clarify the two of them were seemingly having sex about once a week.

This does not sound like a case where she's hyper sexual.\n\nOP says the sister and her husband were still having sex once a week. That's hardly \"you need a doctor because there's something wrong with you\" territory. If she's not satisfied she's well within her rights to walk away, but acting like her husband is abnormal for it is a problem. My sister's ex treated her this way and she told me that the more he asked (i.e. demanded) sex was the less willing she was to concede because it came to feel like a chore.

That makes PA the asshole. \n\nAnd in your specific situation, We don't know PAs libido, we don't know if there's a medical or emotional reason they're not interested in the amount of sex PB wants, we don't know how PB has been handling it, we don't know how clearly the two have communicated...

I've had a few conversations with my husband about it, but otherwise I just hold opinions on her relationship like anyone else who gets told about issues plaguing partners.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your input!

And I understand wanting a lot of sex. Splitting up because of sexual differences is very valid. \n\nThe problem is, based on the information OP has given us, OPs sister constantly pressured her husband for sex and even wanted him to get medical testing because once a week wasn't enough for her libido. And she didn't even seem to offer other things that are necessary in a marriage considering sex was the only thing dividing them from being roommates. Maybe it was harsh but maybe she also needs to realize she has an unhealthy relationship with sex and it doesn't have to infiltrate every interaction. I just can't get over that if the genders were reversed, people would be hollerin about how creepy ops sibling is.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like she has really twisted ideas about what a healthy relationship looks like. Implying that her husband is literally ill because sex once a week isn't enough? That's not kind. Of course he wouldn't want to be touched by her after that. Plenty of people want more than weekly sex, but you don't solve that problem by making your partner feel like there is something wrong with them.\n\n\nYour eyes have opened to the fact that your sister put herself in this situation. Irony is, now she gets even sex less than once a week lol. I'm glad her husband can get out of that relationship.\n\n\nIf she's not being a good guest, you don't have to keep housing her.", "NTA.

Imagine experiencing some form of emotional blow, like a family member dying, or being let go from a job you put your heart and soul into, or just...not feeling happy for some reason because hormonal balances be weird sometimes, and all your partner can offer as support is a roll in the sack. Not a hug, not pat on the back, not kind words or conciliatory gestures like that. No, just 20-40 minutes of sweaty action and she just...goes about her day? \n\nI couldn't imagine spending my life entirely with someone who regards me literally as a bangmaid, which is how your sister regarded her husband.

Yes. Was it exactly what people should be telling her, that her over sexualization of everything has poisoned her relationships and is driving people out of her life? Also yes.

What she is saying is creepy and borderline predatory.", "Nta. Her comment was unnecessary and part of the problem. You're probably not wrong.

Everything had to culminate in sex. Yes meant yes, maybe meant yes, and no meant try harder until it was a yes. I'd get worn down and let it happen just for the same behavior to immediately start back up without pause and without fail. The more he harassed me, the less I wanted it, the less I wanted it, the more he harassed me. I grew resentful and hateful. I hated myself most of all. I felt broken, like a malfunctioning sex robot. I wasn't good at the one thing I was good for. I was reduced to my most basic parts, only worthy if I put out. No matter how often I tried to communicate how I felt, nothing changed.

It was low to make a comment like that to her when you could have just told her the joke made you uncomfortable. I doubt she meant it the way you took it.  \n\n\nAlso, you weren't in the marriage.

But he also wouldn't communicate with me about it. If we'd had some counseling or if he'd been willing to talk to me about what was going on with him, I wouldn't have felt so unsatisfied with our partnership. I said it was the lack of sex, even though I don't care about sex, because at the time I couldn't properly express why I was so bothered.  \n\n\nShe's saying it's because of the lack of sex, but there's alot more that goes on there than just sex and she's probably just not able to express all of it right now.

I've been the husband in that position, went through basically the same thing. I didn't not want sex because I don't like it, but because there were underlying issues in the marriage that made me feel unsafe emotionally. It wasn't until my partner started a support group and realized how he was hurting me, and made changes, that our sex life began to change and improve. Had it not, the marriage likely would have ended because neither of us was happy. We too felt like roommates instead of partners at times, so I can relate.\n\nSex is a HUGE part of relationships and intimacy. Maybe you view it differently but for most couples it is a big part of connecting to your partner and positive mental health.

But you didn't need to bring her marriage into it. You say you were trying to do \"tough love\", but it really sounds more like you got defensive and attacked her in response to the comment that made you uncomfortable.\n\nHonestly, the fact that your sister shared the intimate details of her marriage with you shows me that she trusted you. She confided in you over the most personal and intimate aspect of her life. You maybe could have had a serious conversation with her to see if she was sure about the divorce. I honestly don't think it would have been your business even then, and she would have been well within her rights to ask you to drop it....but maybe she would have been willing to listen.\n\nNow, though, you've shown her that you are willing to attack her with all the most painful things she's shared with you.

We would have sex MAYBE once every two weeks. I couldn\u2019t even get a back rub from the guy. It was driving me nuts. Only to find out he has a major porn addiction and was talking to other girls. It\u2019s true. If sex is not there that\u2019s 80% of your relationship in trouble. I would tell people all the time we\u2019re just glorified roommates. It\u2019s been 6 years now and I can promise you, I wasn\u2019t the one with the problem. I\u2019m in a very happy and healthy relationship.

Though I might still apologize/definitely talk.\n\nI may have a biased perspective (we all do but whatever) because I've often been the partner who was the least sexual in my relationships. No known hormone imbalance, explicitly, but dealing with things like depression, dysmorphia and dysphoria and sexual trauma PLUS being somewhere on the ace spectrum lol.\n\n(Also its at least anecdotally seen in ADHD too, which I also have - time is weird, so to me we just had sexy like, earlier this week or last but in truth? 3+ months.)\n\nFor me, a lot of the time, its just... So not a priority. And its okay if it is for someone, and sometimes it's just amatter of incompatibility then, but I will also say I think in general there's so might wright and importance put on sex in relationships.\n\nIn a surprising twist *I've* hit a point with my partner where I am more interested in sexual activity than them rn. Who can say why. As long as they are okay, I'm fine with that, we chat and check in, and I'm an adult who can handle my own needs as, well, needed. If I'm worried its because they aren't interested or its otherwise affecting my body image and self.esteem, I can both acknowledge that is not their responsibility AND talk to them about it: because again, be an adult, own your own brain and body.\n\nYour sister isn't TA for having needs exactly, and I also know that kind of joke to be made goofily between friends, but I think in the wider scale of things she does need perspective and like, therapy might not be awful if she's taking suggestions.

Who knows why, but maybe she's been trying to fix it and got more and more sex brained. I say this too, bc people don't talk about the importance of women sexuality enough.

Ending it is actually the way more healthy option for everyone involved rather than resorting to coercion to get what one party wants, or giving up on feeling sexually fulfilled entirely. That\u2019s great that YOUR relationship wouldn\u2019t feel like a roommate situation if you stopped or greatly reduced the amount of sex you were having, but again, your relationship is not her relationship. There was no need to effectively slut shame your sister for wanting a satisfying sex life.", "Soft YTA.\n\nSounds like she does think that any contact is sexual in nature. As others have said, intimacy comes in many forms and at different \"levels\". Sometimes a back rub is a precursor to sex. Other times, it's to help a poor tired person with a baseball sized knot in their back get some relief so they can sleep. I gave my ex wife hundreds of 1/2 hour massage therapy sessions attacking her vicious knots (in those two spots) knowing it was a gesture of kindness and not an invitation to initiate sex.\n\nBut back to her husband. A person shutting down intimacy is not really that great, even when there is a valid reason for it. People sign up for monogamy, not celibacy. It was usually the men who complained of this as women tend to shut down sexually a lot quicker if the emotional side of their relationship is wanting. \n\nBut now, more and more women are reporting a problem with a sexless marriage. I mean, this fellow didn't want to be even touched by her. His extreme revulsion for touch and basic intimacy could have different causes. With men, it can be a serious lack of libido and loss of self-esteem. Could be because of employment issues or her having an affair. It can result in  him being completely averse to anything remotely sexual. Then there is the porn addiction problem which is well known for men to because autonomic voyeurs incapable with being attracted to, and bonding with, their own female partners.\n\nI wouldn't say this woman caused her marriage to fail - it's not fair. But, she does have some strange attitudes about sex and intimacy and maybe she was PART of the problem with her husband.

So, a one-shot remark is certainly uncalled for, probably just plain wrong, and you need to apologize to your sister ASAP for saying that, it was wrong and you won't do it again.   \n\n\nKeep encouraging her to talk it over with you & yours, even tho you made a big mistake.  She probably needs to feel heard, and she probably is going to be doing a lot of healing to get all the way thru this.", "ESH. It was a tasteless joke that didnt land well. Youre response was harsh. Your sister and her husband were not compatible in the bedroom (she the HL and it sounds like he became LL4her) and that is a hard thing to end a marriage over. Sex means more to women than men, its more than a biological act. Women become emotionally invested in sex.

You don't get flinching in people at random, it generally doesn't come from nothing, and more than likely in his case it's because he knew most touch from her came only when she wanted sex. Additionally, she assumed just from a glance at her brother giving his husband a foot rub that it was a sexual thing. Plus, there are her other actions such as acknowledging she saw him as little more than a roomate when they weren't screwing, and pressuring him to get medical testing just to see if he wasn't defective or something, because it's impossible he could just...not be as sexually active as her.

Do you have the right to be upset about it? Absolutely, you can tell her \"Hey, I don't like that. That's not cool.\" Instead (as others have rightly pointed out) you go for the throat and say it's her fault their marriage failed. She didn't make a serious of comments, this wasn't a recurring issue. She didn't thrust her hips erratically and moan \"Oh feeet!\" while waggling her tongue. She spoke one sentence. If you're close as siblings of course you joke with eachother, and every sibling has their boundaries. My siblings and I make racist (our own race) jokes against eachother ALOT- that's just how we are. If you guys naturally rib eachither a bit, well it's not like that comment was wildly out of left field was it? Everyone has their boundaries, she didn't see it as crossing a line, you did, so COMMUNICATE that like a reasonable person.\n\nI don't have much experience with romantic relationships and sexual intimacy, but I'm smart enough to know it's different for every couple, and sex can be a very important part of that relationship. My dad and stepmom had their own relationship issues besides the bedroom, but their sexual incompatibility was a big part of it. I'm also aware enough to know that I don't know everything, even about the people I love. They could've had smaller issues she didn't tell you about, they could've been feeling distant in other areas- I don't blame you for making assumptions because you're working off what she told you, and you don't have his side,\n\n>The things she has been saying have floored me. She says without sex, the two of them were basically just like roommates.\n\nIf without sex they were like roommates, I'm not surprised the marriage ended. You should be able to say your relationship is romantic without sex. To me that sounded like she was complaining about the lack of romance in the relationship, that without physical intimacy their relationship(romantic connection) at that point was dead.\n\n>She said he had begun resisting even normal touches from her because from his perspective, all she thought about was sex which apparently isn't true... I'm not sure I believe that.\n\nIf he's always had a low sex drive, and it's only bothering her at this point in the marriage, it's entirely possible (and very likely) that the love was dying/fading already, BEFORE her complaints. Also it's entirely possible their issues weren't JUST sex related, but considering that's the main reason their separating, of course she'd complain/talk about the sex part.\n\n>She said she had been pushing for him to get a hormone imbalance test done because while they were still having sex, it wasn't enough\n\nAlot of people say she's an asshole for this, but what's the context? Was she pushing him because she was simply unsatisfied and wanted to change him? Was it because his sex drive noticeably changed and she was worried at that point? Was it because she had tried/suggested other avenues (kinks, couples counseling, etc.) and they didn't work/he was opposed to it? Did she suspect he was cheating and wanted it to be a hormone imbalance instead? Did she see where their relationship was headed and desperate to find some way to fix it, as flawed as her actions were? I don't think it was right to pressure him for a test, people do stupid things when their desperate to change something (sex or otherwise).\n\n>I've done my best to be supportive, but I can't relate to the thought process at all. If my partner told me tomorrow that he wasn't up for sex for the next few weeks, months, or longer, I would just take care of myself and respect that. I love him and I want him to be the person I do life with forever. \n\nThis is a very sweet sentiment, but personally, I think it's naive. I also want to say that it wouldn't bother me, but I have no way of knowing the future or my actions in it. You're the one in the relationship, you know it better than I ever will, but people and relationships continue developing, and we develop along with it. There have been so many times I've expected myself or people I know to make certain choices based on their ideals/morals/past actions, but they still surprise me, and I surprise myself, because the world is a chaotic, ever evolving place. My life and some relationships are wildly different than they were this time last year, I went from being very close to someone very important to me, to extremely low contact. My parents went from lovey dovey teenagers to hating eachother. My dad went from devoted to my stepmom to bitter to completely done with her within a year. My mother went from loving her husband and defending him to death to making a close male \"friend\" when he ran back to Mexico, even though they're still married, in less than that. Both of them were/are married to their partners for a decade\n\nAll in all, I don't believe you're a bad person, but I don't believe your sister is either. I think YTA for your disproportionate response, and owe your sister a big apology for using her separate marriage issues, that she trusted you with, as an insult to her character and her love life, against something she (clearly) intended to be lighthearted and decently recieved.

You're sister may have her own underlying issues that affected the marriage but hasn't acknowledged them, but you were not a part of their relationship and shouldn't be playing \"connect the dots of their failing marriage\" (I'm exaggerating, but you get my point).

Even if your husband isn't ready or willing to go to couples therapy yet, I feel like you'd really benefit from individual therapy for yourself. \n\nIt is so helpful to just be able to share these issues with someone who can help you figure some stuff out, even if it's just to vent. I've seen various therapists over the years and I got something special from each relationship with them that I was able to incorporate into my whole life and also into my relationship.\n\nI was taught especially to communicate my own needs better, because I wasn't taught how to do that from witnessing my own parents' marriage growing up. It helped us both so much. For a good while I couldn't get my partner to see anyone either. But I was able to lead by example and share things organically with him that really strengthened us as a couple.\n\n \u2764\ufe0f Hang in there. It can get better.

YTA. A lack of intimacy is a huge problem in a relationship. It\u2019s one thing if your partner can\u2019t have sex but he refused to even touch her. You and your husband were participating in a very sweet and simple cuddle that she was being denied. It sounds like she tried to work on it with counseling and trying to get him to see a doctor but it didn\u2019t seem like there was any compromise on his part. \nYou are being a good brother by taking her in but try and see things from her perspective. \nIn a side note her ex may be feeling very emasculated because society says he has to want sex more than his wife but it doesn\u2019t always work that way. \nGood luck.", "YTA.

Aaaand none of those are a thing you've held against her until she made it your problem. People who sexualize intimacy make intimacy unsafe for other people.

Not a partner, not a husband, not a friend or someone you care about, just someone you live with and nothing more. That is REALLY cold. She even treated him like HE was the problom,  that there must be some medical or psychological issue because it's just SO STRANGE he didn't want to have sex all the time. Yet it didn't seem like she would seem open to getting herself checked for her own \"hormone imbalnce\" for her own level of sexual activity, just her husband, or even her lack or non sexual romantic and familal love for him. She admitted that even her \"normal\" touches were received as sexual seems to indicate that in the past touches have been a segway for sex many times before that he felt it had no more platonic or romantic feeling behind it anymore. He DOES give her sex, once a week I think OP said, so it's not like outright leaving her high and dry.\n\nOP has said they have tried to be as supportive as possible despite disagreeing with her and opening their home to her. They didn't argue or put in their opinion and just let her vent. But when shd tried to sexualize THEIR relationship that was clearly too far and she had no room to talk on someone else's intimacy even as a joke. Eveyone here says \"siblings joke about sex all the time\" and \"it's just a joke\". A joke is only funny when everyone find it's funny and it's not at the expense of other, and not eveyones sibling dynamics are the same, as evey relationship and sensitivity is diffrent, this is CLEARLY not that kind of dynamic. And \"it's just a joke\" is a an excuse lots of people use to justify harmful behavior that hurts others and they should just get over it. Up until that point OP had the tact to not state their feelings until their sister made a snide comment about their marrige.\n\nYes, slutshaming is a thing, and yes women are allowed to be sexual as much as they want and she had  the right to leave but that doesnt mean her reasons were nessiarily healthy or understanding she might have had caused or at least contribute to the end of her marrige. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum it's also not okay to shame someone for NOT wanting sex or massive amounts of it,  or treat them like a prude for it. That is very much Intel behavior. That people are only valuable for the sex they can provide and are a bad person or stuck up when they don't reliquosh it. And the misandrist idea that men are suppose to be sex maniacs and always horny and any sex offwred or available should be taken and considered \"Lucky\" is also just a harmful mindset. Op seems to assume this of all men including OP and their husband, even worse of a gau couple being seen as \"promiscuous\" or sexualy deviant or interested in kinks and fetishes.\n\nOp is not in the wrong for clapping back.

Maybe she brought up the sex element to him, because she isn't comfortable being too vulnerable in front of him and she thought that's the part he'd understand. Maybe when she talks to friends she talks about how alone she feels, how her husband basically ignores her all the time. \n\nI'm going through this right now.
