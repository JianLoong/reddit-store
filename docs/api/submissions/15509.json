She said he had begun resisting even normal touches from her because from his perspective, all she thought about was sex which apparently isn't true... I'm not sure I believe that.

ESH.\n\nIt was probably your honest assessment of what happened based on what she told you, but that's precisely why it was very unkind to throw that in her face because she offended you with her dumb, crass joke. She shared her issues with her marriage probably thinking it would be safe to do so with you. You may be uncomfortable with her issues, but I don't think she'd have shared with you if she expected you'd judge her and use it against her that way. \n\nApologize for the remark and let her work out her issues with a counselor from now on. I'm sure she'll appreciate that it's inappropriate/uncomfortable to make weird sex jokes about your sibling in front of their partner, but you also need to clear up that you're not shaming her for having a high sex drive.", "Info: Did she ever try to coerce her partner for more intimacy? Seems like we're missing some context if he started recoiling at her touch. That's a huge reaction that doesn't just pop out of nowhere.\n\nHonestly sexual incompatibility happens in relationships. Sometimes one partner has a high libido and the other has next to no libido. Neither are in the wrong and both are valid reasons for ending the relationship. Your sister isn't in the wrong just for having a high sex drive.", "ESH. It\u2019s weird that your sister made a comment that specialized her brother. That\u2019s fucking weird. \n\nHowever, why did you have to bring her failed marriage into it? She confided in you, you didn\u2019t agree, and you threw it in her face. There are so many ways you could have expressed your concerns about her reasons for her divorce without attacking her.", "Esh - her comment was entirely uncalled for, commenting on how other people express intimacy almost always is. \n\nBut she's perfectly within her rights to not feel sexually satisfied and to want to leave a situation because of it. It doesn't make her a bad person and you a good person, how you'd each deal with a lack of sex. She's not cheating on him, she's not forcing him to be more sexual from what I can tell. She's handling this the way any unsatisfied person in marriage should, by letting the relationship end. \n\nYou deciding to bring her marriage into is was uncalled for when a simple \"don't comment on our intimacy please\" would do. You decided to hurt her simply because you can't relate to her.\n\nYou're also basing your feelings on an imaginary situation where the person you love is in a situation where they can't have sex with you for a reason. \n\nShe was in a situation where nominally everything was average, and she recognized that she wasn't getting enough sex to be satisfied and that it wasn't going to change...\n\nApples and oranges", "Yeah, you are a bit YTA. It really disturbs me that there are people who think that sex isn't important in a relationship because for a majority of couples, it is a very important aspect. If sex is one of her love languages, not being able to express that openly with the person who is supposed to love and support her can be a dessimating rejection. \n\nIf he's not even willing to touch her, that's a problem. If she's to the point where she wants him to go to the doctor, there is a bigger issue. This does not sound like a case where she's hyper sexual. It sounds like she's feeling neglected and rejected by her husband. It sounds like she has a healthy sex drive, and there is something potentially wrong with her husband( whether that be hormones, mental health, or an affair), especially if this is a drastic change from normal. If he's refusing to even find out if there is a medical issue, then yes, the issue is him. Stop slut shaming your sister for wanting her relationship to be healthy.", "That was probably a good moment to show her that not every intimate moment has to be sexual, which was probably your goal as well, but bringing up her divorce so soon after it happened is kind of an asshole move.\n\nBesides, she moved in because she wanted to feel safe and away from her divorce. I get that you had good intentions, but I hope you understand how something like that can hurt your sister. YTA", "YTA. A dead bedroom is absolutely a reason for relationship incompatibility. It sounds like you\u2019re judging her for the fact that she values sex as part of a relationship. You\u2019re different people and can have different values.

If you thought the joke was inappropriate, simply letting her know that should\u2019ve sufficed.", "NTA.

From my perspective, this is a light tease.\n\nThen you proceeded to go nuclear and used something your sister told you in a moment of vulnerability just to hurt her.

Touch & sex are a vital part of intimacy in a marriage.  It's part of the connection.  It's one thing when there is a medical reason.  But just because your partner doesn't want you, it can damage your self esteem & certainly the relationship.  I've been there.  And until you are, you really should keep your judgement to yourself.  Because while you may think you'd know how you would feel, you are wrong.  Second, she made a joke, a pretty innocuous one & you went straight to AH.", "ESH \n\nThe way this post is written does have her coming off as hyper sexual, but how much of that is because you only heard her side of the story about her divorce and then let your thoughts run away I wonder.\n\n I understand her comment rubbing you the wrong way but a firm 'not every touch is sexual sis' would have been adequate. Making it seem as though her marriage ending is her fault alone was hurtful and unnecessary. \n\nWere it me, I would apologize and then set boundaries about the type of language used to discuss myself and my partners actions in our home.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should consider therapy.", "NTA.\n\nA similar reaction was bound to happen. It's one thing if you keep your mouth shut when she is talking about these issues and judging her own scenario, but once she starts projecting it onto you and your husband she's going too far. And if you didn't nip it in the bud then, she probably would have escalated.\n\nIt honestly sounds like the husband already had Walkaway syndrome probably due to many other factors of the marriage and your sister is using the lack of sex as the only reason to excuse accepting her faults in the relationship.

My husband and I have the same perspective. She needs therapy.", "ESH. What you said was cruel but given the context of the way she framed her divorce, it was probably something she needed to hear. It definitely didn\u2019t need to be said in that way but it\u2019s weird to see something your sibling is doing and immediately sexualize it. With how comfortable she was with just saying it, it makes sense why her ex partner would recoil at even normal touches. Her first instinct was to make a sexual joke. It\u2019s not a huge leap to assume her ex partner was uncomfortable with how much she thought about sex, joked about.. etc. Anyways, ESH. You for saying it in the way you did and her for even saying it.", "NTA kick her out", "NTA.  Your perceptions of the situation your sister is in are yours, and while they might not be 100% on point, there is a chance that both her and her partner need counseling.

For example me and my gf if she has never said a thing about me gaming even though we lived together and once we married she is constantly on my ass about gaming that can put a strain on the marriage. While in this case your sister hasn\u2019t been receiving the amount of sex she would like.\n\nThere needs to be more context or information to truly say whether or not your sister is justified. For all we know they used to do it 24/7 and now they do it once a month. The thing that makes you an asshole is that you\u2019re making a leap that everything about her relationship is sexual. It could very well be that it\u2019s just been a major strain on the relationship and that leads to other problems since now she\u2019s probably in a mood because her needs aren\u2019t being met and anything can set her off. \n\nIf you think about it you and your husband are just really good friends that have sex on occasion who love each other a great deal.

It's ok if sex isn't important for you but it doesn't mean that has to be the same for everyone. If your partner suddenly doesn't want to have sex with you without and gives you no reason,  this isn't about taking care of yourself an letting it go, you are in marriage this affects both of you. \n\nYour sister just made a joke and you are acting prude and riding your moral high horse to the sunset.", "I don't think there was any direct coercion, at least from what she's told me. She said she was feeling very rejected because she was trying to initiate a lot and he wasn't receptive except for about once a week, and that she would drop it without pressing him after he gave non-verbal 'I'm not into it' cues or said no.\n\n(However I do find the line between coercion and expression desires to be particularly fine in situations like these. In my past experiences with break ups, there are usually multiple conversations leading up to the main event that take place. How do you properly initiate a conversation where the main takeaway is \"if you don't start sleeping with me x times a week, I'm leaving\" without it sounding at least a little bit like coercion?  I don't know. I think I would be more forgiving if this was a dating break up and not a marriage one, since these problems have occurred their entire relationship past the first few months apparently.)\n\nEDIT: Changed some wording to clarify the two of them were seemingly having sex about once a week.

This does not sound like a case where she's hyper sexual.\n\nOP says the sister and her husband were still having sex once a week. That's hardly \"you need a doctor because there's something wrong with you\" territory. If she's not satisfied she's well within her rights to walk away, but acting like her husband is abnormal for it is a problem. My sister's ex treated her this way and she told me that the more he asked (i.e. demanded) sex was the less willing she was to concede because it came to feel like a chore.

That makes PA the asshole. \n\nAnd in your specific situation, We don't know PAs libido, we don't know if there's a medical or emotional reason they're not interested in the amount of sex PB wants, we don't know how PB has been handling it, we don't know how clearly the two have communicated...
