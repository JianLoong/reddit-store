However, also on this profile he said he \"never\" smoked, which is pretty important to me. I don't mind the odd cigarette on holiday, but to live forever in a cloud of smoke is a big no.\r  \n\r  \nAnd he smoked heavily: 5 cigs in a 3 hour date. Anyway, we had some chemistry & because I'd had a couple of glasses of wine, I didn't say anything when we kissed a few times but... it tasted \\*horrible\\*. Like an ashtray.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, he asks me out again & I agree because as I say, there was definitely a connection - and that date was yesterday. When I arrived we started chatting etc & then he got a cigarette out. So I said, you'd better kiss me now before you light up, because I won't want to afterwards! He looked FLOORED by this, as though I'd told him we were both about to grow horns and a tail . He asked if I was serious & I said I was. He then gave a speech on how he doesn't need me to guilt trip him about it and he's going to quit soon anyway and I can't make him stop then & there.\r  \n\r  \nI calmly listened & said he didn't \\*have\\* to stop, but that he was smoking we wouldn't be kissing, as simple as that. It was a choice. Then we had a kiss and he lit up.\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of the evening he smoked several more - repeatedly pulling me in for a kiss and time & again gave him my cheek & a smile. He made a big deal, raising his voice with \"she's trying to say I can't smoke blah blah blahhh\"\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, the night ended realising there was pretty much no clear way home for him from the place we were, I reluctantly said he could crash at mine. Reluctant because he wouldn't stop advances for a kiss numerous times during the night, & I was concerned that if I mentioned another boundary (like the fact I wasn't going to sleep with him) he would try and try again like he had done all night.\r  \n\r  \nI started working up some serious anxiety about it, which he could see on my face when we were about 10 minutes from mine. He asked me what was wrong and I told him and I also said there was a night bus he could get back to his place if he did want to go home, he could now do so more easily, from this location.\r  \n\r  \nInstead of saying \"omg, I'm so sorry I made you feel that way\" - he replied \"it's too late, I\u2019m too tired to go home now (around 4:30am at this point)\" and then joked \"anyway, I'm not going to sleep with you, you'll have to work for these nuts\"\r  \n\r  \nHonestly I felt beyond stressed at that point and didn't want him coming back to my home at all and it was written all over my face. He noticed and said \"Cmon, it was a joke!!\" and said \"Nah I can't do this, you keep picking at me and I'm not a perfect person!\" He then walked away and presumably went home.\r  \n\r  \nI'm 100% relieved he didn't come home with me, but AITA for setting the smoking kissing boundary and how his repeated attempts made me feel?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1696770101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172ym0t/aita_for_a_2nd_date_boundary_because_of_smoking/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't be afraid to set your boundaries and hold firm to them - if smoking is a dealbreaker, then when someone lights up, walk. No amount of 'chemistry' is worth the crap this guy was pulling, particularly when he made it clear that he wasn't going to respect your wishes about not kissing him after smoking. Much better to be single and enjoying life than coupled up and miserable, after all.", "Don't go out with him again. \n\nNta", "NTA. I\u2019m waiting to hear about the chemistry you claim was there and why you even entertained the idea of dating a dude who actively LIES on his dating profile. Besides his gross behavior and making you feel uncomfortable, what does he have going for him? \n\nLook, it\u2019s more than ok to have deal-breakers and for me, smoking cigs is a deal-breaker. His whole attitude about it is shit, but the fact he lied would have been enough to send me running the other direction. Not you though, and I can\u2019t figure out why. He\u2019s a liar and he knows he has to lie in order to even get a date. Then he knows he\u2019s making you feel uncomfortable, the unwanted kissing attempts, it all sounds so creepy and uncomfortable. Please don\u2019t go out with him again.", "NTA. Smokers shouldn't date non-smokers. Full stop, no exceptions. I learned the hard way too. Besides, this guy is an obvious AH, even without the smoking. Why would you ever want to see him again?", "NTA - I'm a smoker, and his behaviour was I don;t know how to describe it. Suffice to say, he made you uncomfortable, and things probably would not have progressed well had you let him stay at your place.  Also when people say \"it's a joke\", they're usually trying to turn it around on you so you feel guilty. You're better off unmatching from this guy and not having anything to do with him again.\n\nGood luck in the dating game in the future.", "Very weird how you just brushed past the blatant lie on his profile. You do you I guess?", "For transparency I should probably add that this came along with me mentioning a couple of other things that I wasn't a fan of during the evening: not asking me any questions about myself (it was a 2nd date! ! ) - his response being that \"he learns about someone by watching and observing them, not asking them questions; plus I also mentioned that he kept getting up, and walking ahead without me whenever he was ready to leave a particular section of the venue. I'd just have to get up and run after him. I started to feel ridiculous trotting after him again and again, so I mentioned it, and he dismissed it off-hand. I feel like I should share this, as he felt like I was nagging and prodding at him all night, which although I don't feel I was doing, might be the case which I understand and feel bad about if so.", "NTA but honestly shouldn't have gone on date #2 knowing the smoking was a deal breaker. I'm a smoker, I get why non-smokers draw a like there, I wouldn't want to go on a 2nd date with someone that considered my habit a hard stop. I'd consider making this a one date situation for you instead of multiple dates", "NTA. He's a boundary pusher.", "NTA\n\nIs this even real?\n\nWhy would you go on dates with a guy who: lied to you about smoking, got angry when you questioned hi smoking, raised his voice in public? OMG so many red flags.\n\nThen you invite an angry liar into your house? It's probably not going to end well if you keep doing things like this.\n\nYou need to pick better guys.", "NTA. He misled you on his dating profile, then kept doing something that bothers you and pouted about it. Bullet dodged.", "Setting boundaries doesn\u2019t make you an A/H. But all of his behavior(s) certainly leans in that direction. The question isn\u2019t whether or not your an A/H for setting an obvious boundary. What you should be asking yourself is why you would be attracted to someone who was so obnoxious that you would even go on a second date with them. Was the chemistry really that good? Or, are you fooling yourself into thinking that it was for the sake of justifying a second date? \n\nNTA but you should definitely reconsider if you have issues with self esteem or raise your standards in what your looking for in a relationship.", "If smoking is a dealbreaker, you can ask, but once he says no, continues chain smoking, and starts teasing you about it, you have to realize it\u2019s part of who he is, at least for now.\n\nYes, he lied, but you can\u2019t start a relationship by seeing who someone is, then arguing about it all night.\n\nNTA for setting boundaries, but you will be an AH to yourself if you don\u2019t just acknowledge this is who he is and keep staying and trying to date a guy who isn\u2019t right for you.\n\nand let the red flags go party with each other somewhere out of your life.", "NTA. I would've cut the first date short as soon as he lit up his first cigarette. He lied on his profile - and you stayed. So he knows he can keep trying to cross your boundaries.", "NTA.  The relationship between the two of you started with a lie.

It's easy to see that the relationship won't work out.", "Honestly, I\u2019m going to say YTA just because you took the time to write all this out. Otherwise ESH.

I told my husband that smoking is a real breaker for me, as is being drunk all the time. Thankfully he had quit smoking 3 years prior to me, and once we got serious he stopped drinking his nightly beers.  I didn't care if he had a beer to unwind, it was the getting drunk that scares me, but he decided he just wasn't going to drink at all,  and I appreciate him for that. We have been married 10 years, and besides trying a bit of moonshine when in east Tennessee, and the occasional glass of wine(usually at New years), there has been no alcohol. \n\nThere is someone for everyone out there, but you have to pass on the ones that aren't for you to get to them.", "NTA.
