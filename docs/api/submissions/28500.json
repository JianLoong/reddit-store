I don't mind the odd cigarette on holiday, but to live forever in a cloud of smoke is a big no.\r  \n\r  \nAnd he smoked heavily: 5 cigs in a 3 hour date. Anyway, we had some chemistry & because I'd had a couple of glasses of wine, I didn't say anything when we kissed a few times but... it tasted \\*horrible\\*. Like an ashtray.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, he asks me out again & I agree because as I say, there was definitely a connection - and that date was yesterday. When I arrived we started chatting etc & then he got a cigarette out. So I said, you'd better kiss me now before you light up, because I won't want to afterwards! He looked FLOORED by this, as though I'd told him we were both about to grow horns and a tail . He asked if I was serious & I said I was. He then gave a speech on how he doesn't need me to guilt trip him about it and he's going to quit soon anyway and I can't make him stop then & there.\r  \n\r  \nI calmly listened & said he didn't \\*have\\* to stop, but that he was smoking we wouldn't be kissing, as simple as that. It was a choice. Then we had a kiss and he lit up.\r  \n\r  \nThe rest of the evening he smoked several more - repeatedly pulling me in for a kiss and time & again gave him my cheek & a smile.

Don't be afraid to set your boundaries and hold firm to them - if smoking is a dealbreaker, then when someone lights up, walk. No amount of 'chemistry' is worth the crap this guy was pulling, particularly when he made it clear that he wasn't going to respect your wishes about not kissing him after smoking. Much better to be single and enjoying life than coupled up and miserable, after all.", "Don't go out with him again. \n\nNta", "NTA.

His whole attitude about it is shit, but the fact he lied would have been enough to send me running the other direction. Not you though, and I can\u2019t figure out why. He\u2019s a liar and he knows he has to lie in order to even get a date. Then he knows he\u2019s making you feel uncomfortable, the unwanted kissing attempts, it all sounds so creepy and uncomfortable. Please don\u2019t go out with him again.", "NTA. Smokers shouldn't date non-smokers. Full stop, no exceptions. I learned the hard way too. Besides, this guy is an obvious AH, even without the smoking. Why would you ever want to see him again?", "NTA - I'm a smoker, and his behaviour was I don;t know how to describe it. Suffice to say, he made you uncomfortable, and things probably would not have progressed well had you let him stay at your place.

I'd just have to get up and run after him. I started to feel ridiculous trotting after him again and again, so I mentioned it, and he dismissed it off-hand.

He was there all along....5'9, hadn't been on a bike or a run in years and was almost bald. And at least a decade past 35. He recognised me as I got up to leave. I (very politely, promise) explained to him that yeah, people WILL notice the missing inches and hair and the extra years.", "What? How is this supposed to make women want you?", "Like immediately after he lit up his first cig on the first date.", "Vancouver Canada shout out lol", "Arranging a 2nd date with someone you really don't want to sleep with in which it's close to yours and he'll have no real way home is just, ridiculous. If you have a 2nd date and don't make arrangements to be able to get home you're also ridiculous and magically when he wanted to go home when he realised sex was definitely not going to happen he decided to just go home. \n\nIn other words OP ignored it and the guy intentionally created a situation where OP would feel it was the 'nice' thing to just let him crash at her place, where he'll then pressure the hell out of her for sex and may or may not take no for an answer.\n\nOP doesn't deserve anything bad to happen but she needs to wake up and be less naive. Maybe op is colour blind, sees a giant red flag and thinks it's green. When he lights his first cig OP should see a liar, someone she doesn't want to date and not kiss him or arrange a second date, let alone a second date that will leave him 'unable' to get home and inviting him back to hers. It's just, have some common sense ffs.", "Taxis, Ubers exist", "She probably just signed up for a third date.", "bruh he could smoke the cig, blow the smoke at her and spit in her face and she'd probably marry him"]}
