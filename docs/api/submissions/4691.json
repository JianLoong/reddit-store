Bringing an estranged family member who was deliberately not invited is another.\nNo idea how to \u201cresolve this.\u201d Anytime you do something wrong.

Your sister deserved consultation since no one else has a relationship with him.", "yta by a long shot. It\u2019s obvious your dad caused so much hurt to your family and you included. There are times where surprises won\u2019t be taken well and this was definitely one of them.

The biggest one. \n\nAs for resolving things.  Apologize until you are blue in the face and hope that she is a forgiving person.  You took a happy thing from her after she (and the rest of your family) went through a long period of unhappiness.  There isn't a quick fix for this one.", "YTA - your sister and your dad were estranged,  naturally your sister had a lot of issues to deal with before she'd even considering to reconnect with her dad, you forced her to deal with it on her wedding day for crying out loud.", "INFO - why do you hate your sister so much that you would do this to her?", "YTA, and I'm also inclined to agree with your sister, you knew it would cause drama and were probably trying to make a point about your newfound relationship with your dad.", "YTA.

Do I really need to explain why bringing an uninvited person for your plus one is wrong?", "YTA completely inappropriate, if she wanted him there she would have invited him. \n\n\nGoto one of the advice subreddits for what to do to resolve it.

That's not a +1 that's a timeb0mb", "YTA, a plus one certainly isn\u2019t meant to spring an estranged father who ditched her as a teenager on the bride. \n\nI\u2018m not sure this can be resolved anytime soon. A sincere apology is important but after that you should tell her you understand if she needs time and respect if she wants to cut contact.", "Omg YTA. You brought literal drama to your sisters wedding, and everyone knows a plus one is a date or a partner. Also, did your dad say anything about going? For example, \"maybe I shouldn't \"?  Because if he didn't, he's an AH as well.\n\nEdit: I just saw that you asked how to fix this. 1. I'd suggest family therapy for you and your sister - do not include your dad. 2. Sincerely apologize in person - if she won't see you then by hand written letter. 3. Never do something like this again.", "YTA - why would you even do this, let alone on her wedding day", "Oh YTA.. You should've asked beforehand if she's comfortable with your biological dad coming to her wedding day. Just because she said she kind of misses him, that does not automatically mean that she'd love to see him! She might not be ready yet! And to do it on her special day too..I'm speechless. I would apologize and give her space so she can process her emotions.", "YTA\n\nWhen someone is a \"deadbeat father\" they completely abandoned their wife (who they claimed to be loyal to) and ruined their kids' lives.  And, by the time they marry, the odds are the rest of the family has taken him in as part of the family.\n\nSo it is basically a betrayal of your entire family.  It would be like inviting Judas (who betrayed Jesus) to meet the Disciples after Jesus was crucified.   \n\n**AND YOU INVITED HIM TO YOUR SISTER'S WEDDING**.\n\nEven if your intentions were good, you truly did not think for one minute about how anyone else would actually feel about seeing someone who betrayed them all.\n\nHonestly, I don't know how you can **ever** start to fix this.  You completely ruined your sister's wedding, hopefully a once-in-a-lifetime event.   Congratulations.\n\nTalk to each family member and explain and be prepared to do whatever penance they require and maybe, years from now, you might be off their shit list.", "YTA you should have checked with her. Just not on to do this. You need to be grovelling to her.", "YTA. \n\nOh dear. What a big mess. \n\nYou\u2019ve greatly erred if you think this was the occasion to have a surprise family reunion. You blindsided your sister on her wedding day.", "YTA. You call him deadbeat in the title. Yet there is little such inclination in the post. It's like you know what problems led to your parents' split. How could you not have known that taking him as your \"plus one\" would cause problems?? What was the reason you didn't just talk to your sister first?\n\nYou kinda dug yourself a grave when it comes to your relationships with your family. They now need space. Let them have it, and stop digging that hole. Stop trying to excuse your bad choice of an unannounced wedding guest.", "YTA. You shouldve open up about you bringing your Dad to her wedding. A date is one thing but your Dad who had unresolved issues with your family is another. It's best to start apologizing and give her time to forgive you.", "Yes, YTA.  At the VERY least you should have asked sis whether your +1 was acceptable before breathing a word of it to biodad.  It should have been glaringly obvious to you that if she wanted him there, she would have invited him directly.  Instead, you smuggled him in under cover of your +1 and blindsided her.  \n\nA wedding IS the couple's special day.  Not yours or anyone else's.  It's the one event in life where you pretty much get to have things exactly as you want them and are not obliged to take anyone else's desires into consideration.  A ton of thought, effort, planning and money go into making that event happen.  Then you spring a surprise on the couple and expect them to be delighted?  AH behavior.\n\nThere's not much to resolve.  You screwed up a once in a lifetime day, and nothing can change that.  You can sincerely apologize, but there's no fixing this.", "I\u2019m sorry but how are you asking this question? Of course YTA!!! This was so insensitive and crossed a line that I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll be able to come back from! \n\nYour sister confiding in you that she \u201ckind of misses\u201d him was NOT A WEDDING INVITATION. He left when you were four which means she was THIRTEEN when this jackass abandoned her. That is very different trauma to anything you might have experienced at four. \n\nYou ruined your sister\u2019s wedding because you were too self absorbed to think of anyone else. The fact that your bio dad went along with it speaks volumes on the kind of man he is today (also self absorbed and shitty). \n\nYou can apologize but brace yourself because you might have truly destroyed many relationships, especially with your sister. You\u2019re 22\u2026it\u2019s time to grow up.", "YTA", "YTA. Your sister is an adult. She would have reached out to him if she wanted him in her life. She would have invited him if she wanted him there. These were not yours to decide for her.", "YTA, big time! You deliberately hurt your family and ruined your sister's wedding. Prepare yourself, because unless they're saints, they're not going to want to have much to do with you.\n\nEditing to ask how could you NOT know that it would cause problems? I'm sorry but I don't believe for a minute that you didn't intend to cause a scene.", "YTA. You can't really have thought that this would be a nice surprise. What an awful thing to do.", "YTA. If she wanted him there she would probably have invited him herself. I guess you didn't clear it with anyone judging by the reaction you got when you pitched up with him. You definitely overstepped a boundary.", "Oh, YTA hands down. \n\nYour situation is one of the FEW situations where the truth will never come out. Both of your parents will tell \u201ctheir side\u201d of the split, neither side being honest and the truth gets lost in translation. With that said, it is not up to you to bring an absentee parent who walked out on you guys to your sister\u2019s wedding, because YOU \u201cdeveloped a good relationship\u201d with him VIA social media, AND DIDNT TELL YOUR SIBLINGS about communicating with him in the first place. And the cherry on top is you invite this person to your sister\u2019s wedding. You\u2019re not gonna fix this anytime soon. You said yourself you\u2019ve grown more closer to him, than your mom and stepdad. Ok, that\u2019s fine. Enjoy that, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna be for right now.", "YTA, do your family a favor and go NC, they're better off without you", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't have invited him to her wedding.\n\nIf it were a BBQ or something I'd let it pass but not her wedding.", "JFC! How could you have possibly thought this would be a good idea? YTA, like a lot.", "Wow. I get you thought that it was a nice surprise but you were 4 when your Dad walked out, your sister would have been about 13 so she has a completely different memory of the situation and the man than you do. Your poor sister having to see the man who walked out on her as a teenager rock up on her wedding day like nothings happened.\n\nYou owe your sister a massive apology and time and space to deal with your betrayal.", "YTA\n\nWOW. Just wow.", "Wow, you realized so fast how much you destroyed your relationship with your family just because you want to entertain a deadbeat.", "YTA - please don\u2019t think you know more/better about a situation that happened when you were **4** vs your mom and the 13yo he also abandoned.\n\nAlso, **being willing to alienate yourself from the people who\u2019ve always stood by you for the man who abandoned you (then you still had to be the one to reach out to him to initiate contact)**, it\u2019s something you might need to explore the roots of. It seems like you\u2019re very upset with everyone else but him when he is the person who initiated all of these situations by abandoning his wife and five children. He gets a pass while everybody else gets a different energy.", "What a vile person you are. \n\nLike others I\u2019d also like to know why you hate your sister so much? Congratulations you pretty much rendered yourself dead to the rest of your family, you must be very proud of the person you are. \n\nYTA. Eugh I can\u2019t even believe what I just read.", "YTA. You brought someone she not only wasn't expecting but with whom there is inevitably a long and complex history to her wedding unannounced. If she'd wanted him there, she would have invited him herself. You didn't bring a random guy you were dating who could remain semi-anonymous, but a man whose presence is inevitably going to bring up a lot of negative emotions.", "YTA.", "Absolutely YTA you knew it would cause drama", "YTA. I see your edit, forget the autism excuse.  With us AND your family they may be weary of that catch all excuse.\n\nYou said you have an inability to \u2018read the room\u2019.  Thing is, you shouldn\u2019t shouldn\u2019t have brought him TO the room as it were.\n\nYou want to let her have a chance to reacquaint herself with him?  Suggest lunch together.  You don\u2019t roll up with him unannounced at her wedding.  Also an AH move to everyone on your moms side of the family, especially your mom.", "YTA.  And you do not resolve it.  It's one of those things where now the damage is done, and it can't be un-done.  It's great that you have a good relationship with dad now.  But he hasn't been in your sister's life in decades.  You had no way to know (good or bad) how your sister would react to him suddenly showing up at the wedding.  A surprise like that was 100% going to be very, very good...or very, very bad.  And you took that risk at her wedding?", "YTA. Deadbeat Dad? No, you\u2019re the deadbeat Sister. Congrats on deliberatley (you knew what you were doing) causing irrelerable damage.", "YTA. You know you are, it isn't a question. This isn't a \"reading the room\" mistake.", "YTA. Jesus christ. Honestly im not sure if you should contact them. That is some next level fuck up", "A person's wedding day is not the time or place for such \"surprises\". Ever.

A wedding isn't the place for that kind of reunion. Your father wasn't invited and if your sister wanted him there she could've invited him.\n\nInfo: What did he say/how did he react when you invited him?? *He should've known better than to come himself*", "While I won't go as far as to designate AH status, I think your age coupled with the autism may explain somethings.    I probably was the eternal optimist, rose colored glasses type person at that age without fully appreciating the consequences of my actions.    \n\nI don't sense any malice behind your actions, and when you know better, you do better.  So lesson learned.", "YTA  and you have also been played by your so-called father. He knew exactly what would happen when he showed up since he was not invited. Even if you don't pick up on social cues, he does, and he chose to  throw you under the bus in front of your whole family. \n\n\nLooks like your dad isn't only a deadbeat father but also a manipulator.", "YTA. You knew what you were doing. And throwing in that edit about autism to gain some sympathy is just wrong. \n\nYou 100% knew that you were bringing a huge bomb to your sister\u2019s wedding.  It was HER special day that you ruined.  You absolutely knew how everyone would react.  Did you for one moment think about how this would affect your mother, who was left with 5 children to care for by this miserable man? How about your siblings? Or the rest of your family that had to live through his desertion, and pick up the pieces? How did you expect this reunion to go?  At a friggen wedding of all places.  One of the most special days in some people\u2019s life.  Do you care about anyone but yourself?", "dude wtf?!?! YTA obviously. I\u2018m sorry for your family. This sperm donor left you on purpose and never looked back and then you stab your family in their backs.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019ll spare the obvious because you know it by now: you fucked up BIG time. Your sister was 13 when she, her siblings and her mother were all **abandoned** by your father with no warning.  For almost 20 years she has been abandoned by him - longer than he was in her life before he did so. It is incredibly traumatic to be abandoned like that, especially at that age. \n\nYou on the other hand were 4. You would barely remember him before he abandoned his family. Therefore you wouldn\u2019t have as many negative points as the rest of your family. While it has been relatively easy for you to reconnect, it will be next to impossible for your sister. There\u2019s too much damage there that is unforgivable. \n\nAs for fixing it? Unfortunately what you also did was unforgivable. A lot of wounds have just been ripped back open, and not just for your sister. Autism may explain a little bit of your failure to read the room, but it does not excuse it - you cannot hide behind this.\n\nYou need to apologise first and foremost. You also probably should limit your contact with him for now - and **DO NOT** tell him about your siblings and mother. He left them.

She said she misses him, how are you supposed to know that actually means \"I hate him and never want to see him again\"??) but she didn't invite him herself and there's obviously a reason for that so you should have asked in advanced.\n\nI think a-hole is too strong a word but you should apologize.

You knew that there's high tension with your family and your father, so you should've asked the bride if it was ok at least.\n\nBut for your sister to jump down the jealousy line, and for your family to bombarde you with texts.... it's extreme. Even if he was manipulative, they would think he manipulated you.\n\nNow then, I come from an abusive family on my mother's side. My father left, we were told because he didn't care about us. She also got married quickly to a new person and had kids quickly. I was young so I didn't remember my dad, but my brother did and I'm sure that his memories have been distorted. I wanted to seek my dad out, and I was told nasty things about him, how he was abusive, manipulative, etc. and I was given examples. I met him a few years ago, and none of it was true. I even have a cousin from the same family that went NC, and relayed that that's exactly what the whole family is like. I got bombarded with texts telling me what an awful person I am.\n\nI'm telling you there's things here that do not add up.

The way your fam (specifically your sister) are acting is like them being mad at someone who's wheelchair-bound not being at a party in a building that's not wheelchair accessible. because \"we'll we could have figured it out when you get there\". they're being extremely harsh.

And yes, emotions and anger and some backlash is deserved, even getting him kicked out is deserved. But calling her jealous and kicking her out too, and the bombardement of texts afterwards... there's got to be more to it. The sister has known OP for a while, she has background with OP. We do not.\n\nAlso, I argue that there is. Why would the mother discourage her from talking to him unless he's manipulative. If he's manipulative, why would the family give backlash to her. Maybe the family didn't know, then why would they text her at all, why is it their business.

We also don\u2019t know why the bride would call OP jealous. There is no context given but a few words, even uncalled for, when your deadbeat father arrives at your wedding after nearly 20 years? I think the sister was justified, or at least gets a pass. \n\nHow am I (or others) projecting?

Also, the time for grace and patience isn\u2019t when you bring that drama to someone else\u2019s WEDDING. OP messed up big time and deserves the backlash she\u2019s receiving.
