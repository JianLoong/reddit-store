{"id": 23841, "submission_id": "15hkqgv", "title": "AITA for ruining my family vacation over soup?", "selftext": "I (F17) recently went on a 2 week vacation with my mom, dad, and sister to Europe.\n\nHalfway throughout our vacation, my dad mentions he wants to go get soup for dinner at a restaurant nearby. My sister asks if he can buy dumplings for her as she does not want to leave the hotel room. My mom at this point was out sightseeing by herself, as she often did because my dad, sister, and I all don\u2019t care much for sightseeing. My dad goes out to get the soup and dumplings, he comes back with an additional order of chicken and rice in case my mom or I want to eat as well. When everyone is getting ready to eat I hear my mom say \u201cI want the soup. I\u2019m going to drink the soup, you can eat the rice.\u201d\n\nThis rubs me the wrong way as my dad has always let my mom speak over him as she is very aggressive. I ask aloud, \u201cAre you going to drink dad\u2019s soup?\u201d to show my annoyance but also just ask to see why she is so blatant about taking my dad\u2019s meal when he purposefully bought chicken and rice for anyone else who wanted to eat. This caused my mom to walk with an attitude towards me saying, \u201cYeah I\u2019m going to eat his soup.\u201d Which my dad follows with, \u201cIt\u2019s okay I\u2019m not that hungry anyways\u201d to try to deescalate the situation and prevent an argument from happening as he knows things can go from zero to one hundred in an instant with my mom. \u201cI\u2019m going to eat his soup and even if he WAS hungry I\u2019d still eat his soup,\u201d is what my mom countered with. She then proceeded to degrade and said things like fine if no one wants me here i\u2019ll book a plane ticket home for tomorrow, you guys do whatever since no one wants me here, no one cares about me and no one listens to me ever, things like that. We placed bets on whether or not she actually bought that plane ticket later as she made a big show of saying the cost and date of the ticket out loud for the rest of us to hear. She then continued to pack up all of her things and make a big scene. I\u2019m forgetting some of the details but the four of us ended the discussion in tears.\n\nThe next day my mom did not say a word to me or my sister (this isn\u2019t the first time she gave us the silent treatment either, she didn\u2019t talk to me for the five months leading up to my 16th birthday and on my birthday she still refused to speak to me). I kind of feel bad as I initiated the conversation but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my fault that it escalated into something so big where the rest of us still don\u2019t know if my mom booked her own flight home or not.

This is emotional abuse.", "No apologies. \n\nThis is also a little odd since people have cell phones and the restaurant is nearby.

Damn that's some passive aggressive melodrama from mom. She does this stuff to maintain control, and it's manipulative and nasty. If you all know that ANY criticism will lead to a blowup like this, you're less likely to confront her, which is exactly why she does it. I say let her stew for as long as she wants. She's not actually upset, so let her act up all she wants. Seriously, this is borderline emotionally abusive. Maybe not even borderline. \n\nIf you really want to annoy her, just ignore this stuff completely. It'll drive her nuts.", "Wow.\n\nNTA.

It's very, very difficult having people like her in your life. I wish you well.", "NTA. You are not responsible for the behavior of your parents at any age, but especially not as a dependent minor. It's kind of you to stand up for your father, but it's not your battle to fight.

And then later on she'll apologize....but then she'll do it all again.\n\nYour mother, like mine; there are real issues there. That go BEYOND just \"being an Asshole,\" and it shouldn't be infantilized to such a small thing.\n\n\\*And 'borderline personality disorder' is what I was thinking of. That's what my Father thinks my Mother has. When my mother is good, she's good; when she's bad, she's the worst.
