Meanwhile, I've been divorced since 2013, but my daughter \u201cDana\u201d is still close with her bio dad \u201cDick\u201d until now.\n\nI met Mike in 2016. After we married, we had a near-perfect family, and TJ was even comfortable enough to call me mom.\n\nHowever, on April this year, TJ was hit by a drunk driver and was killed instantly. Our family was devastated.\n\nUnderstandably, Mike was inconsolable. I was the one who made the arrangements for TJ\u2019s service and made sure the drunk driver was jailed. In his grief, Mike didn\u2019t come out of the house for months. He's now seeing a therapist to help him process everything.\n\nThen, last month, Dana told me that Dick invited her to spend the holidays with him. I said no. Christmas has always been tough for Mike because of his wife\u2019s passing (Dana knows this), and now, he also lost TJ. I told Dana that we\u2019re the only family Mike has left, so we\u2019ll be celebrating Christmas at our home. She was disappointed but seemed to understand.\n\nHowever, yesterday, she pressed again. This time, over dinner with Mike. Dana said that Dick rented a vacation house where they could go skiing and do other fun stuff. However, I still said no, and I explained to her again why.\n\nAfter an hour of arguing, Dana started raising her voice. Mike intervened and said maybe I should just let Dana go. I still said no. I know Mike was just being modest and that he\u2019d be heartbroken if Dana leaves (I know I will be). I then said something like \u201cCome on Dana, this is the first time we\u2019re celebrating Christmas with just the three of us. How about we make those cookies TJ really liked?\u201d\n\nThen, to my shock, Dana replied with \u201cHe\u2019s not even my real brother! And Mike\u2019s not even my real family! I want to spend time with my real dad!\u201d then stomped her way to her room. This was the first time Dana acted like this. Mike had been nothing but kind, caring, and supportive to her. She has also told me that she feels good and safe with Mike. We even baked a cake during TJ\u2019s birthday, and Dana made a beautiful slideshow to honor him. Mike then told her how much she means to him as his daughter.\n\nI looked at Mike, who was on the verge of tears, but he just told me to let it go since it\u2019s Christmas time, and maybe Dana was just being a teenager (she\u2019s 15) and to just let her spend time with Dick.\n\nI then went to Dana\u2019s room and told her that she can spend Christmas with Dick if she apologizes to Mike. She refused, saying she didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. That\u2019s when I started to get mad. I told her that she\u2019s staying home for Christmas and that I\u2019m taking all her devices during the break. I also said she won\u2019t be joining her friend\u2019s sleepover after New Year.\n\nDick then called and said I\u2019m overreacting and that I\u2019m an AH for ruining Dana\u2019s break. However, I don\u2019t see how disciplining my child makes me an AH.\n\nSo, AITA for what I did?", "created_utc": 1702965087, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18luoqe/aita_for_punishing_my_daughter_after_she_lashed/", "score": 1594, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like since the passing of his son, TJ, you want to push Dana towards Mike for him to be a father for her. When her biological father is very much in her life. That explains why everything escalated so damn fast, your overreaction, and why you're so determined to have Dana spend Christmas with Mike instead of Dick. Makes me wonder if you've done something similar before, during another holiday or event. Especially with how Dana exploded. People don't just randomly act out of character all of a sudden. There has to have been something building up over time.\n\nYour husband needs YOU, his WIFE, to give him all the love and the support he needs right now. Not you ruining everyone's Christmas by forcing people to be unhappy together. Mike knows that Dick is Dana's real father and how close they are, and he respects that. You, however, don't.\n\nIf you ruin your daughter's Christmas because of your own selfishness, you will create something that can't be stopped. You've already planted the seed of resentment inside of her. Which caused her to lash out at him, saying things she probably does regret due to her anger towards you. You will only make the love and respect Dana has for Mike diminish the more you try to force her onto him. Causing him more pain.\n\nDo better!", "YTA. You are making this about your husband and his feelings. Yes he's had a horrible run as a father and husband, no doubt. However your daughter isn't some emotional support animal to be there for his sadness.  That's incredibly selfish of you to make her do it.\n\nHow about you be there for your husband, and let her go enjoy Christmas without sadness and spending time with her dad.", "YTA.\n\n>I want to spend time with my real dad\n\nListen to her. She should be your priority, not you or your current husband. Everything about this post makes me understand why she needs to spend time away from you.", "Yta\n\nPoor Mike.\n\nHis son died and his wife destroys his relationship with his stepdaughter by treating her as an emotional support animal for him rather than as a person.", "YTA- you decided she can\u2019t spend time with her own father because YOU decided another man needs her as an emotional crutch.  You put your daughter\u2019s needs last.  Then when she lashed out (rightfully so) you pulled the authority card and punished her. Your behavior in this instance is actually immature.  It\u2019s akin to having to have the last word.  Where is the conversation? Where is compromise?  Where is even ASKING YOUR OWN CHILD HOW she feels???  Have you even helped HER process TJ\u2019s death?   She could\u2019ve been so upset by it and now she\u2019s just telling herself that there\u2019s no reason to be that upset because he wasn\u2019t even really her brother. It\u2019s a coping mechanism.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s how she feels or what is going on but you clearly haven\u2019t even bothered to ask. \n\nYou\u2019ve made it crystal clear that she is NOT your priority.", "In your efforts to console your husband, you are pushing your daughter away.

Please remember this also all happened to Dana. People grieve in different ways. And she asked for something she probably needed and then reacted like a teenager who can\u2019t express herself correctly when you shut her down. Let her go have a break from the grief. It can be overwhelming to feel the weight of adult\u2019s emotions on top of your own when you are a teen. Try to go a little easier on everyone, yourself included.", "Info: Has your daugjter not been able to spend Christmas with her dad since you married your husband?\n\nDo you guys not have a custody agreement?", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is not your husband\u2019s emotional support animal.

She does not want her Christmas to be focused on your husband and his grief.  \n\nWhat happened to your family is tragic and I can\u2019t imagine how much you are all suffering.

Keep pushing and you will permanently destroy relationships.", "YTA Let the girl spend the holiday with her dad without all the drama next time.", "YTA and the end of the day as hard as it is to hear - Mike is not her father. \nYour daughter is old enough to decide with whom she would like to spend her holiday - and this year she wants to spend it with her dad. \nYou and your husband aren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019ve had a hard year, let her go and enjoy her Christmas.\n\nEdit: at this point you\u2019re only going to have a hostile and miserable daughter for Christmas - is this worth ruining everyone\u2019s holiday? (Even Mikes, because he\u2019s obviously your first priority)", "YTA - \u201cHow about we make those cookies TJ liked\u201d tells us everything we need to know about why your daughter lashed out. You\u2019re being incredibly selfish in this situation. You\u2019re only thinking about what you want instead of the the *separate* needs of your husband and daughter. If anything, TJ\u2019s sudden death is a good reminder of why your daughter needs to spend time building memories with her bio dad. The trip is also a brief escape for a young girl who\u2019s being living in a house filled with grief for the better part of a year. Your husband is not the only one who needs support right now. Your daughter does too. And it\u2019s your job as her mother to ensure that she gets it\u2026.no matter what your husband is going through.", "YTA. She honestly lashed out because you pushed her and wouldn't take a no for an answer. You don't seem to respect her wishes, and just because you remarried does not mean she doesn't have a biological dad anymore. She's been with you guys, why isn't she allowed to have a moment with her dad? It could've been handled better instead of just making her feel like a selfish person, you need to consider it might be needed for her to de-stress instead of just staying in a grieving environment all the time. It doesn't mean she doesn't care if she wants to have a little fun during her holidays, and taking her devices is not discipline, it's just revenge.", "YTA.\n\nIt is your fault that your daughter blew up at you and her stepfather.\n\nYou are the one who needs to apologize for making everything worse.", "YTA. All you did was prioritise your feelings above everybody else.", "YTA. Almost every kid of a stepparent I know has pulled the line \u201cyou aren\u2019t my real dad/mom\u201d, I haven\u2019t bc my ex stepdad was to scary abusive for me to do that but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s normal to happen. And it seems your husband is okay with your daughter going to her dads, so I don\u2019t understand what the problem is. I think punishment for this is an overreaction, I don\u2019t understand what she did wrong to deserve that. I think being upset that your mom isn\u2019t letting you go to your dads is perfectly understandable. Put yourself in her shoes and really listen to what she\u2019s saying, and take the moody teenager part out of that or it\u2019s going to make it worse. You are here to help her not be at war with her. Also listen to the other comments, she\u2019s not responsible to make sure your husband is happy, especially if he said it\u2019s fine I would just let her go to her dads.

How can you not see that? You wanted to deny her time with her dad because YOU wanted her to comfort her step dad. Doesn\u2019t matter how great he is or what tragic event he went through. She is a child and deserves time with her dad and does NOT need the burden of comforting adults. Ever think she\u2019d like a normal holiday without things being depressing?", "YTA .. Another reason she probably wants to spend time with dad is because she's treated like a priority at his house. Clearly it's not happening at your house were Mike is the priority. From here your relationship is probably just going to deteriorate further.", "Yta, it's not your daughters responsibility to make everyone else feel better, you havnt took her into consideration at all through any of this, it's all about what you want and what your husband needs.

Let her go to Dick\u2019s, who cares. Just have Christmas with you and Mike and watch some videos of TJ as a baby or something. Grief is really confusing and hard so I can imagine where you\u2019re coming from with Dana\u2026 did you stop to think that maybe you don\u2019t want her to go with Dick because *you* actually want her to spend Christmas with *you* because *you* are grieving TJ and this has *nothing to do with Mike*? Mike lost his only son\u2026 I can basically guarantee he wants Dana to do whatever makes her happy.\n\nVery gentle YTA, mostly because you\u2019re the adult and you were being inconsiderate/unreasonable to your child while she was properly expressing her need, desire, whatever to go spend time with her dad. You need to take a deeper look at your own emotions and role in all of this. I think you\u2019re hurting more than you\u2019re letting on. I hope you guys get through this and I highly suggest talking about your feelings around TJ\u2019s death with a therapist.", "What exactly are you disciplining her for?\n\nShe loves her father and wanted to spend Christmas with him. You wanted to force her to spend it with you and your husband because he's grieving, but she's a person, not a consolation prize. \n\nI'm very sorry for your loss. But this calls for a heart to heart talk about empathy and compassion, not punishment for the way she feels.\n\nYTA.", "Yta. Your daughter doesn\u2019t want to spend Christmas baking cookies that a dead kid liked and talking about him. She is not as emotionally invested in this new family as you are. Let her be happy with her dad and don\u2019t drag her into depression just because your husband is depressed. He will never get over the loss of his son. But it is not fair to punish your daughter with his presence.", "Soft YTA. I know you aren\u2019t doing it on purpose, but it sounds like you were prioritizing your husband\u2019s feelings over your daughter. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with that, per se, but there is something wrong with using your daughter as an emotional support child for your husband. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter made clear she wants to spend the holiday with her dad and that her dad had something fun planned. Nothing in this post suggests that there is a custody agreement that makes that not ok. And it seems like the ONLY reason you said no to your daughter is because her wishes, while good and happy for her, would make your husband sad. \n\nYour daughter, understandably, doesn\u2019t want your husband\u2019s happiness to come before her own. Maybe that is selfish but it\u2019s also u deters sable, especially from a 15 year old who had likely felt \u201cback burned\u201d since her step brother\u2019s death.\n\nWhat she said sounds mean and hurtful. It likely also wasn\u2019t true. But it was also very likely the words of an emotional teenager who is really expressing anger about feeling second or third most important right now.\n\nIt\u2019s an emotional time for everybody. Cut her some slack. I can promise trying to extort an apology out of her won\u2019t help, but letting her go and telling her you love her and asking her how she is feeling about the things that happened might help.", "YTA\n\nYou're trying to make your Husband feel better (and in doing so *give yourself* a more pleasant holiday season than you anticipate, considering the circumstances) by shoving your unwilling Daughter into his dead son's spot. You're a top-tier, selfish Asshole. Your reasoning is afflicted and your justification for punishing your daughter further is obscene. \n\nYour sweet Daughter may be reacting to her Step-Brother's death by wanting to strengthen and increase her time and bond with her own father; and there you stand waving your demanding fist fist in her face because you want her at your disposal.", "YTA. You've gone too far.\n\nI think what the kid did was appalling, no question. And your reaction to defend Mike is understandable. But just think what you've committed to do here.\n\nYou've committed to spend the holiday making the kid miserable. She's going to have an awful time, and you're going to have an awful time enforcing it, and Mike is going to have a truly miserable time watching you do it and watching this kid blame him. \n\nI think the best thing to do would probably just let her go and focus on Mike. Christmas isn't going to mean a thing to him this year anyway. I kind of understand the kid's desire to be out of there, the best you can say about this coming Christmas is that you'll get through it somehow.", "Oh wow, YTA big time. You've allowed your own emotional needs cloud your reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then, last month, Dana told me that Dick invited her to spend the holidays with him. I said no.\n\nSo your ex-husband and daughter both wanted to spend time together over Christmas, and you shut it down unilaterally? (Allegedly) because of your new husband? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I told Dana that we\u2019re the only family Mike has left, so we\u2019ll be celebrating Christmas at our home. She was disappointed but seemed to understand.\n\nJust because someone understands something doesn't mean they accept it. And it doesn't sound like you allowed for much in the way of open discussion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>After an hour of arguing, Dana started raising her voice. Mike intervened and said maybe I should just let Dana go. I still said no. I know Mike was just being modest and that he\u2019d be heartbroken if Dana leaves (I know I will be).\n\nYou argued for an hour? What was said in that hour? It's odd how you omitted one hour of conversation. And \"I know I will be\". Interesting, so you don't just want Dana to stay for Mike's sake, you also want her to stay for your own personal emotional needs.\n\nAnd have you actually asked Mike about his opinions on the matter, or merely assumed that it's essential that Dana stays with you over the Christmas holidays? Just out of curiosity, but do you think it would make Mike feel great that the only reason Dana stayed to 'support' him was because you forced her to? Because if I was buddied up with someone who wanted to be anywhere but with me, I'd feel awkward and embarrassed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then, to my shock, Dana replied with \u201cHe\u2019s not even my real brother! And Mike\u2019s not even my real family! I want to spend time with my real dad!\u201d\n\nNo doubt she said this out of anger after you had shown no interest in her own emotional need to spend time with her biological father, had refused to listen to husband Mike's opinion that perhaps Dana should go, had refused to listen to your ex-husband's desire to spend time with his daughter, and had spent an hour arguing with your daughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We even baked a cake during TJ\u2019s birthday, and Dana made a beautiful slideshow to honor him. Mike then told her how much she means to him as his daughter.\n\nIt sounds to me like Dana has done a lot of emotional labor to help Mike since his son died. I'm not saying he hasn't reciprocated with affection and love, but you need to be aware that you've essentially voluntold a teenager to be an ongoing emotional support person to a grieving adult, at her own expense. And again, I'm not even sure you want Dana to stay purely because of that, because you said *you* would be heartbroken if she went and spent Christmas with her father.\n\nAnyway, caring for Mike's emotional needs isn't Dana's responsibility, it's YOURS. YOU are his wife. If you can't meet his needs then he can talk to his therapist and adult family members (who can CHOOSE if they want to support him, and choose how much support they give)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I then went to Dana\u2019s room and told her that she can spend Christmas with Dick if she apologizes to Mike.\n\nYOU need to apologize. YOU need to acknowledge that you have been unfair to Dana, and express gratitude for how hard she has worked to help support a grieving adult.  YOU need to admit to her that you were being selfish. Because frankly you are selfish, and I think you're reacting so harshly to Dana because she's finally pushing back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She refused, saying she didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. \n\nI mean, technically she is correct. You ex-husband is her 'real' father. She expressed it in a very blunt way, but the poor girl has been imposed upon and had her wishes ignored by you for so long it's little wonder she struggled to express herself diplomatically. I'm over twice her age and would have said far worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That\u2019s when I started to get mad.\n\nThen you should have walked away and composed yourself. Way too many parents enact punishments when they are mad and haven't had a chance to calm down and empathize with their kid, and they end up imposing overly harsh punishments that they are reluctant to backtrack on because it would make them look weak and falliable. But parents aren't fooling anyone, their kids generally know when they aren't being fair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I told her that she\u2019s staying home for Christmas and that I\u2019m taking all her devices during the break. I also said she won\u2019t be joining her friend\u2019s sleepover after New Year.\n\nOh wow, do you want to absolutely nuke Mike and your relationship with Dana? She has two completely legitimate grievances (Being an adult's emotional support person for a prolonged period of time, and being denied a holiday with her father because of your and your husband's emotional needs). \n\nAnd what she said while harsh isn't exactly untrue. So you're going to be vindictive and harshly punish her for telling you a truth that you don't like, and lashing out for being unfairly imposed upon and denied a well-deserved holiday with her father?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dick then called and said I\u2019m overreacting and that I\u2019m an AH for ruining Dana\u2019s break. \n\nYou're the AH, a selfish one at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>However, I don\u2019t see how disciplining my child makes me an AH.\n\nYou're not disciplining her, you're reacting vindictively because she won't cater to you and your husband's emotional needs, and I'm not even sure if your husband's emotional needs matter that much in your mind, since he said she probably should go. Quite frankly, **it's all about you.** You aren't fooling me, you're not even fooling the masses on Reddit, and you aren't going to fool your 15 year old.", "YTA.

Losing someone makes us realise that we can lose anybody that we care about in just a moment. She has probably internalised the fear of losing you and her father since TJ\u2019s death.

You said the holidays have always been rough for Mike since his wife died, and perhaps faced with the prospect of an even gloomier Christmas this year without TJ, she was looking forward to having a break and spending a fun holiday with her dad at the vacation house. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s much you can do for how Mike feels around the holidays, but there\u2019s still time to allow your daughter to enjoy a fun holiday memory with her dad. It\u2019s your job to comfort Mike, not your daughter\u2019s.", "OP, YTA. It sounds like you need to be taking your daughter to family therapy.\n\nWhat she said is a super normal thing that most teenagers in blended families have said at least once. You probably said it (or a variation of it if you grew up with married parents) at least once yourself.\n\nI understand that it seemed especially hurtful given the circumstances, but it's unfair to expect her not to be a teenager just because of a tragedy. In fact, I'd argue the fact that TJ was killed by a drunk driver is probably causing her more stress than if it had been something your family could prepare for. Teenagers think they're immortal. Most teenagers have to confront that belief throughout their teen years and each time it's a huge, crushing blow. But to have to confront that through the death of your step brother? That's brutal.\n\nShe's been watching her stepfather grieve in some really scary ways. It sounds like you're very anxious for him -- which makes sense -- and she's undoubtedly picking up on that. It sounds like she really likes Mike and cares for him. That's a huge burden, though, for a teenager to be worried about her stepdad and worried about her mom and reeling with her own mortality.\n\nShe wants to spend some time pretending things are normal with her dad. I'm sure if you could do that, you'd want to too. It's unreasonable of you to decide she can't because you can't. She's not an asshole for being able to pretend things are normal with her dad, she's a teenager who needs some breathing room and a break from witnessing everyone else's grief.\n\nLet her spend this time with her dad. Apologize to her for not seeing her frustration. Most teenagers double down when they say something mean, but with a little bit of space, they usually feel really guilty. If she's still not able to understand that she needs to try and be gentle with her words to Mike, that's something to address as her mom (as empathetically as you're able), but you kind of pushed her into this -- she overreacted, but she needs a break and even adults sometimes overreact when they're past their breaking point.", "YTA. Mike seems like an understanding dude and teenagers say hurtful things. However, your daughter isn\u2019t wrong. You are forcing a relationship on her she doesn\u2019t feel. Mike is your husband. Not her dad. Let her spend time with her Dad. Especially after how depressing and stressful Christmas at your house has been. Let her go be a kid. You can\u2019t punish a kid into having familial feelings for someone she doesn\u2019t.", "YTA bruh let the kid spend christmas w her dad", "YTA.

Your daughter is not an emotional support human. \n\nYes the holidays are hard when experiencing tremendous loss, but it\u2019s not your daughter\u2019s responsibility to manage that for you. She has another parent and if she wants a break from the grief in your home she should be allowed to have it. You are the one who escalated all of this and pushed her to the point of lashing out. Now you\u2019re punishing her because she isn\u2019t grieving in a way that you approve of. \n\nShe wants to spend the holidays with her father, it\u2019s not a betrayal of anyone.

You forcing her to stay home, will only make everything worse. She's 15, that's a normal age to push people away.

That is a child. She has feelings and needs, too.\n\nIt\u2019s also unfair that she doesn\u2019t get to spend the holidays with her bio dad because of the pressure you\u2019ve put on her. Mike had the good sense to say let her go. You should\u2019ve listened to him and your daughter.", "Oof, this situation is haaard. I just had a friend lose her husband with kids who are 15 and 17. Grieving is hard. The first 2-4 years of holidays after the loss are hard. Having extra attention and pressure on you because your sibling died is hard. Being 15 is hard. Having divorced parents is hard. \n\nShort term I would let her go with her dad, returns her devices and resume the NY Eve plans. She's handling grief badly - as badly as many 15 year olds handle everything - but she's probably really grieving. And reeling from the grief everyone else is radiating. It's important to remember that she can't be your emotional support. At 10 she could have and at 25 she will again but not at 15.\n\n\nLong term,  get a family therapist for everyone. You'll need to find ways to balance really really living in the present along with grieving TJ and TJs mom.  You don't want to lose your daughter because your house turns into the grief house.", "YTA.  She\u2019s a child and while your husband has some deep grief, you can\u2019t ignore hers as well. This environment must be very hard for everyone, and her request to spend some time outside of the house without constant grief is appropriate and healthy. Your pushiness in ignoring her needs is just going to cause her to lash out and want to dissociate from her source of pain. Let her go to her father\u2019s trip, and have a talk afterwards about hurting other\u2019s feelings.  The way out of this is to step into normalcy slowly, not be trapped under grief all the time. Follow her example, and book a trip for you and your husband for the holidays.", "YTA\n\nDana may have been rude in her delivery, but she's right. At 15 she should get to choose who she spends Christmas with, this year and every year. Be careful, you may not get many Christmases after she leaves home if you press on with this course of action.

For her age, saying things like that, lashing out, is a common way to compartmentalize feelings in the grieving process. Also the only reason she blew up and said hurtful thing is because you continuously pushed her and invalidated her as a person.\n\nSo now thanks to you being a massive a-hole and wanting to get your way, your daughter is miserable, your husband is miserable, your daughters father is miserable.

Rather than jumping straight into reacting to her behaviour, it would have been better to wait until emotions had settled a bit and then discussing how very hurtful it was to say those things, including acknowledging the accuracy of her statements, \u201cI know he\u2019s not your father and Tj wasn\u2019t your brother, but Mike loves you very much and to hear you say those things was very painful for him.\u201d Also showing your understanding of her wanting to be elsewhere, would have gone a long way towards helping her calm her raging emotions.\n\nShould she apologise to Mike, absolutely, should that be a condition for spending time with her dad, absolutely not.

What she said was terrible. Teenagers can lack compassion and this is an extreme case.\n\nYet, however unkind and immature, I can understand emotionally that she might want to get away from her grief-stricken family to her bio-Dad's relative comfort for a \"normal\" Christmas. As an adult, I can say the right thing to do would be to be with you as a family...however, she is not an adult and she has two families and one of them lets her escape to have some fun and to specifically get away from the grief and sadness. It's your role as a Mum to ensure your daughter has healthy emotions, and it sounds like your are very much putting your adult needs on her - and your husband's need on her. It's too much and not appropriate.  I even suspect that the awful things she said are to push away her brother and step-dad so they mean less to her so she is not so close to the pain...and also to get back at you for deciding unilaterally she cannot see her other family. This was wrong of you and a huge assumption.\n\nOn another line, it's also not clear to me that she must or even should miss enjoyable opportunities in her own life because of the death of her brother. Again, I think this was an assumption you made, but it's not clear this ought to be the case. I think you're assuming a lot about your \"family\" experience of this loss versus Dana's experience. For example, you suggested you could make TJ's favorite cookies, and this speaks to how you want to process your grief, but what if this would be extremely triggering to Dana?\n\nWhat she said was terrible, but I suggest you put it to the side and try and find some curiosity about where it came from and what her sincere perspective is and don't try to force her to grieve with you at Christmas. I say this in part because I think it might help your family in the long-run and defuse this becoming a theme of push and pull and resentment.\n\nYou all need support, love, therapy, and spiritual support if you lean that way.\n\nWishing you and your family peace.", "YTA.

You're not disciplining your child by punishing her for telling the truth.\n\nI agree that she did it in a wrong way and your job is to make her see that for herself. You cannot just say \"go apologize!\". Because what does that matter if she does not believe in the apology? Does that make your daughter a better person?\n\nAnd it's simply not your daughter's responsibility to be an emotional crutch for your husband. You should NEVER put that kind of stress on a child.

Meanwhile, I've been divorced since 2013, but my daughter \u201cDana\u201d is still close with her bio dad \u201cDick\u201d until now.\n\nI met Mike in 2016. After we married, we had a near-perfect family, and TJ was even comfortable enough to call me mom.\n\nHowever, on April this year, TJ was hit by a drunk driver and was killed instantly. Our family was devastated.\n\nUnderstandably, Mike was inconsolable. I was the one who made the arrangements for TJ\u2019s service and made sure the drunk driver was jailed. In his grief, Mike didn\u2019t come out of the house for months. He's now seeing a therapist to help him process everything.\n\nThen, last month, Dana told me that Dick invited her to spend the holidays with him. I said no. Christmas has always been tough for Mike because of his wife\u2019s passing (Dana knows this), and now, he also lost TJ. I told Dana that we\u2019re the only family Mike has left, so we\u2019ll be celebrating Christmas at our home. She was disappointed but seemed to understand.\n\nHowever, yesterday, she pressed again. This time, over dinner with Mike. Dana said that Dick rented a vacation house where they could go skiing and do other fun stuff. However, I still said no, and I explained to her again why.\n\nAfter an hour of arguing, Dana started raising her voice. Mike intervened and said maybe I should just let Dana go. I still said no. I know Mike was just being modest and that he\u2019d be heartbroken if Dana leaves (I know I will be). I then said something like \u201cCome on Dana, this is the first time we\u2019re celebrating Christmas with just the three of us. How about we make those cookies TJ really liked?\u201d\n\nThen, to my shock, Dana replied with \u201cHe\u2019s not even my real brother! And Mike\u2019s not even my real family! I want to spend time with my real dad!\u201d then stomped her way to her room. This was the first time Dana acted like this. Mike had been nothing but kind, caring, and supportive to her. She has also told me that she feels good and safe with Mike. We even baked a cake during TJ\u2019s birthday, and Dana made a beautiful slideshow to honor him. Mike then told her how much she means to him as his daughter.\n\nI looked at Mike, who was on the verge of tears, but he just told me to let it go since it\u2019s Christmas time, and maybe Dana was just being a teenager (she\u2019s 15) and to just let her spend time with Dick.\n\nI then went to Dana\u2019s room and told her that she can spend Christmas with Dick if she apologizes to Mike. She refused, saying she didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. That\u2019s when I started to get mad. I told her that she\u2019s staying home for Christmas and that I\u2019m taking all her devices during the break. I also said she won\u2019t be joining her friend\u2019s sleepover after New Year.\n\nDick then called and said I\u2019m overreacting and that I\u2019m an AH for ruining Dana\u2019s break. However, I don\u2019t see how disciplining my child makes me an AH.\n\nSo, AITA for what I did?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Quit being so selfish and trying to act like you\u2019re being selfless. Who did she spend Christmas with last year? Typically kids alternate. Dana just wants ONE day of normalcy. Also, I feel like Mike seeing YOUR child opening gifts and doing all the Christmas things will only cause further hurt on his end because it\u2019s a reminder his son isn\u2019t there with them. Also, her LIVING father who WANTS to spend time with his child is just being swept under the rug. What if (heaven forbid) something were to happen to Dana before next Christmas?

While OP is over reacting I believe there were better ways to have figured this out. Making the child jealous by feeding her more info and making her try to change OP\u2019s mind is not right and the pushing by OP to stay home is not right because the daughter is right, it\u2019s not the daughters responsibility to be SD\u2019s therapist.

Some of it's probably related to TJ's death, some of it may also be if there's any lingering tension or sadness in the house because of it, and some of it may have to do with her relationship to her stepdad in general. I'm curious how well you know your daughter's feelings about having a stepdad? Because her saying she's safe around him is different than seeing him as a father. Maybe I'm reading into it a bit because your daughter's situation is a lot like mine when I was a teen, but the way you wrote makes it seem like, because you got a new man--a new family--your child, who already had a perfect family in you and her bio dad, is just supposed to automatically accept this new man as a father, which is NOT how any of this works. You don't have to see her father anymore at all if you don't want, but it seems like you expect her to either love both these men as dads or, based on your punishments and inability to compromise (why can't you just do 2 Christmases a week apart or something??), you want her to replace her bio dad with her step.\n\nI'm not a psychologist, but honestly, I'd suggest having a real sit down with your daughter and listening to her emotions on this. Maybe she won't have much to say. Maybe she feels like she has to (and has had to) keep up a strong front for you and won't say much.

Communication in a relationship is key, if Mike really is okay with Dana going then you should trust that what he tells you is how he feels, if not it's his responsibility to communicate his feelings effectively.\n\nThe fact that Mike intervened and told you to let Dana go and you STILL said no, is what really proves that you're assuming Mike's feelings and taking over, ignoring his wishes. Not only do you need some grief counselling but y'all should maybe look into some couple's counselling too!", "Mike said it was ok.

Let her know her choice, let her know the consequences of each, then respect that choice.  \n\nThat said, her remark to Mike, particularly about him not being her real father and TJ not being her real brother, was incredibly hurtful.  She needs to apologize for that.  And I think that effectively grounding her for her thoughtlessness is an acceptable punishment.", "NTA.

He might think it nice, bittersweet too but nice, to have a quiet Christmas with just you two. Having to parent anyone,and especially a pissed off 15 y.o., is stressful. He likely feels he has to \"be strong\" for everyone but his grief must be crushing. Give him peace for Christmas.\n\nDana is 15. She wants what she wants and is lashing out, thoughtlessly and hurtfully, when she doesn't. She is pushing away the reason she is being given for having to stay home. This is all on brand for 15. I get it is hard to step back and give in, you don't want her to think she has \"won\" or that this is a viable tactic in the future. If you start seeing arguments and other family conflicts in terms of who wins, you have already lost in the big picture, and long term it will damage your relationship.\n\nYou have to remember, despite her words, she lost TJ too. You all must be drowning in grief, just trying to manage until it hopefully hurts less one day. To a 15 y.o., who is still learning how to express herself and how to process any of her emotions, it must be even worse. She probably feels like she can barely breathe for all of it. A holiday with her dad, away from all the grief, and with a chance to do fun activities will be like a breath of fresh air. The chance for her to step away from all that, to escape her grief and loss and just be a kid for a minute is a gift beyond measure for your daughter. It will all still be there in its horribleness when she comes home. Please give her a break from all this. In the long run it will be good  for her, for you, and for Mike.\n\nYou OP, overreacted. You need to apologize to Dana for that. It is good for our children to see us apologize when we act out of line. It shows them it is ok to be wrong as long as you atone. Explain your reasoning, even point out where your thoughts were clouded or flawed. How else is she going to learn it if not from the parents in her life \n\nMike's hurt and you want to protect him in his time of vulnerability. I get that and applaud the instinct, but Dana is just a child lashing out. In the end, her hurtful words are likely just a fart in a hurricane to Mike. If you force her to stay, especially on restriction, it will only make it worse for everyone, and the entire break will be filled with more lashing out, pouting, and resentment. Far more damaging to everyone, including Mike and his relationship with Dana, than one thoughtless comment.\n\nYou also have a duty to protect Dana. Keep in mind that to her this trip probably seems like a lifeline to a drowning person. Not letting her go will feel like you (emotionally) pushing her back under. It doesn't seem like it, but letting her go IS the win. Explain to her that while it is true Mike is not her biological father, throwing it in his face is hurtful and kicking someone when they are down is especially egregious, even when it is \"true\". Truth is not some magic word that takes the sting out of hurtful remarks. You should tell her that you won't MAKE her apologize, but that she should, this will be especially poignant if it happens after your apology to her. \n\nShe sounds like a pretty good, relatively normal, teenager that is suffering a loss. If you explain to her what she did, what effect it had, and give her space to do the right thing, she will almost certainly apologize on her own.

I was lucky to get an awesome Step-father, who I called 'Dad'. She's being a petulant, arrogant child, but it also could be that she's hurting as well. Despite her words, she probably loved TJ. Teens sometimes have a hard time dealing with the feelings. You showed respect for your husband, while trying to also respect your daughter's feelings. As far as your Ex and his words go, HE'S the AH for saying that. He SHOULD have maturely talked to you about it. You could tell him what your daughter did, told him the compromise you offered, and that she petulantly refused it. If he isn't helping the problem, he's a part of it. My Ex and I talked things over about our daughter. We informed each other about things that she experienced, did or tried. That way, we could fairly co-parent. If she told me that she our daughter had done something, I would listen to what she had to say, and, if she punished her, like grounding, before I picked her up for visitation, the punishment extended to my house as well, and vice versa. We sat her down together, when she was old enough to understand, and explained that to her. She only tried to play us off against each other once, and found out that we did, indeed, talk to each other.

If she forces her daughter to stay for Christmas and ruins Dick\u2019s Christmas plans with his daughter, it will *clearly* save Mike\u2019s Christmas. *She wants it*, so it will clearly resolve everything.

Which would partly explain why Dana is so devastated that she's being told she can't go (not that the extra explanation is particularly necessary).

I think the subconscious reasoning is that if she's 'doing this for Mike', she can't be being selfish when she's demanding Dana make sacrifices, because they're not sacrifices *for her*. Except they are, I think.\n\nI think that's the big blockage getting in the way of her communicating about or understanding the issue at hand - either way, I completely agree she's steamrollering over what Mike and Dana are telling her. And the thing is, whether it's OP's feelings or Mike's that she's concerned about, neither of them trump Dana's on what she (Dana) needs to do with her own life, her parental relationships and her mental health.

Her dad offered her a route out, and her mum turned around and closed that off. I get that she would be *all kinds* of emotions about that. Her reaction, though, was absolutely unacceptable. *Despite* that, I still think she should go to her dad\u2019s over Christmas, it\u2019s the best place for her. Propping up a grieving man is beyond her capabilities unless she personally chooses to do so. I do think that some level of parental discipline was due following her outburst, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s appropriate for that to run over the entire Christmas period. Tell her she\u2019s done wrong, make her understand what she said was wrong.

I don\u2019t like OP\u2019s solution here, and she seems to have less awareness of her duties as a parent right now than, well, you do. But to just blithely claim that because a 15 year old is angry, the fact that they did the most hurtful thing they could think of in the moment is not something that needs to be addressed, just shows to me that you, personally, are about 15 and don\u2019t like being told what to do by your folks.", "Well, no, I don\u2019t think so, which is why I called her an asshole in the first instance.", "Except dad is clearly not responsive to the discipline, so just sending her there would just be letting her get away with it\n\nAnd its not like OP is asking for much at this point, she said she told daughter she would let her go to dad if she apologized to Mike, and apologizing to Mike shouldnt be a big deal since hes completely innocent in the matter to begin with", "Dana is 15 now. \n\nAFAIK, she was 5 when OP and Dick split and 8 when OP and Mike got together.

I can see why she said what she said. She\u2019s most likely lumping Mike in with her mom and thinking he\u2019s agreeing with her having to stay for Christmas, which I agree isn\u2019t fair but she has the mindset of a teen so she doesn\u2019t think of things like we do. I would assume she said that to try and hurt them to let her go, but do you poke a bear until it attacks then get mad at the bear? No! You get mad at the instigators pushing it over the edge.

Why does your daughter have to be sad on Xmas because your husband is? Are you going to force her to spend every Xmas with your husband because he\u2019s sad?\n\nAlso, you\u2019re basically running Xmas for everyone\u2026\n\nMike is gonna be miserable and your daughter..idk how that helps anyone..", "Oke so this kid has been tiptoe-ing around you and your depressed husband. The dead kid and his depressed father have probably been the center of attention for months since he passed. She's probably emotionally burnt out already. Done with the emotionally charged house she calls her home.\n\n\nNow she's now not allowed to celebrate Christmas with her father where she can just relax and not have to be emotionally drained and be considerate for other peoples feelings (she definitely put in an effort with the presentation and everything. She has 100% been a supportive (step) daughter!). Celebrating with her own father who is still very much alive. \n\n\nShe needs to be you and your husbands emotional support animal. \n\n\nThen you take away her communication devices, cutting her off from the network she can vent to about you and your husband. Sure, let those thoughts and emotions bottle up and fester. That's going to make Christmas fun for sure!\n\n\n\nThen to top it off, you offered to bake the cookies her brother liked. For whom? Who is going to eat it exactly? Why not bake something that's HER favorite, if you are already keeping her hostage. Why not give her SOMETHING to enjoy for herself?\n\n\nWhen are you going to consider your daughters emotional needs? When are you going to prioritize her? Make her the center of attention for once. Christmas is about family right? Why Arent you making an effort of appreciation your daughter? Seems like a very one sided responsibility here, and its only your daughters effort.\n\n\n\nKeep pushing, and you will destroy the relationship your daughter has with your husband.\n\n\nKeep prioritizing your dead step son and his father even more, and you will lose the last living thing you care about: your daughter. She's very likely going to move in with her dad if nothing changes, and she might even go no contact to escape from all the misery and drama. \n\n\nAlmost forgot, YTA", "OP, you have a blended family. They're often complicated and messy in the best of times. But loss sucks. You have a husband with a lot of trauma. You have trauma. And, guess what? Your daughter does, too. You're doing what a lot of people try to do: force things to be normal. Guess what? They're not. Things will never be the way they were before. \n\nYour husband could barely function for months, but somehow you expect your daughter to just go about things as normal. Your daughter is probably emotionally tapped out. Instead of disciplining your kid, you should be talking to her. She's 15, not 5 months. If you want this family to work, you need to show each member of your family that they matter. *Particularly* during the bad times. You're not really doing that at the moment. \n\nI hate saying this, but YTA. You just can't see it at the moment.", "I think I get where you come from. Both Mike and you are grieving. I assume TJ considered and called you mom because you loved as if you were (in that case you *were* his mom). I understand that anyone in your situation would want her/his family by their side and to be together for Christmas and not feel the absence of our deceased loved ones. And I understand that if your daughter leaves home, that loneliness will be painful.\n\nBut, have you talked with Dana and expressed that you, too, would want her to be there for you? You state in your post that you also want her home, but it feels like you are guiltripping her to be there for her stepdad and not telling her you also want her to be home. You are not letting her decide what she wants and you are not considering what she needs or thinks. You should consider she might be grieving too and she might need to do something fun to feel better. \n\nEverybody has their own way of grieving and you should respect that and respect that your daughter is starting to make her own decisions, you shouldn\u2019t force a 15yo girl to spend Christmas with both you and your husband grieving, nor force her to be with you instead of her dad if she really wants to be with her dad. While she might be just 15 in terms of maturity, she is not far away of becoming an adult and she has to be able to start having a choice, and in terms of custody/spending time between you and your ex-husband, you should let her decide instead of forcing her to be with you. Also I have to ask, have you been paying attention or have you been too focused on your husband\u2019s grief and (inadvertently) yours without taking her into account. I also feel that could have taken a toll on her willingness to stay for Christmas. You know that she will be able to enjoy Christmas with her dad and you should already know that your husband and you, are too deep into your grief to provide it to her, let her enjoy Christmas.\ud83c\udf84 \n\nI think that while I truly do understand this is a very difficult time for your household/family your daughter has a very good chance of having a great time with her dad and creating the kind of memories with him that your husband and you have with TJ and you should be thankful that she is able to, this might be the thing she needs. \n\nWhat I would do, is apologize with your daughter, acknowledge that you also wanted her to be there and also tell her that you respect her decision and you let her spend Christmas with her dad. Unground her. Return her devices. Apologize 15 more times. Tell her you are also a human being and that you see you made a mistake and you are trying to rectify it. Apologize to your ex-husband and be open about grieving and not being able to react correctly at the moment and thank him for trying to help her and make her happy.\n\nOn another note, you should seek therapy for you if you haven\u2019t already and ask her after Christmas if she feels that would/could help her.\n\nAt the moment YTA. But you still can and should rectify and amend things with her. Please do the right thing, apologize and update us with the outcome.\n\nSorry if I have bad grammar/punctuation or my writing style feels weird to read, English is not my first language.", "YTA. Did you ever stop to think that your daughter is grieving her step brother? Being home for Christmas without him will be hard on HER. Maybe losing her brother has made her appreciate her dad more. She spends a lot of time with you and Mike. Nothing she said is untrue, just not worded nicely. You are punishing her for speaking the truth as she sees it. \n\nLet her go with her dad. Give her back her devices. Tell her you were wrong, and YOU are sorry. Ask her, gently, to let Mike know she didn't mean to hurt him. Mike will probably appreciate a quiet Christmas with just you. This will be a very hard Christmas for him.\n\nAt 15, your daughter can tell the courts she does not want to live with you, or visit you. If she tells the judge that you are stopping her from seeing her dad, because her step brother died, the judge will grant her request. Punishing her for something beyond her control is abusive.\n\nDo better. I am old enough to be your mom. Do better.", "YTA.\n\nOP, your daughter clearly has views that don\u2019t align with your own. She honestly told you how she felt and what she thought and you punishing her for revealing the truth ain\u2019t gonna help because it doesn\u2019t align with Mike\u2019s environment and circumstances.\n\nSounds like the only family she cares about are those related biologically. Most people are just wired like that to choose people who are related over those not related.\n\nI would also add that she may be unable to process to grief of loss as well, being 15, so it seems she wants to remove herself from the source of tragedy, misfortune and grief. \n\nDo you expect her to grieve like Mike? Because he\u2019s going to do it for a lifetime, this man has lost both his previous wife and son tragically. No one gets over tragedy like unless they become even more traumatized by something else.", "This poor girl sees her step dad lose his son and how it devastated him. I can see how she would 100% not know how to deal with this. and I can see exactly why she wants to spend time with her own dad. but instead you're trying to force her to fill in for TJ. YTA and it's not even close. i don't know how you can type it out and not even read i between your own damn lines.", "YTA. Also grief therapy would be a good idea. Have you actually asked Mike what he needs and wants for his first Christmas without his son?\n\nAnd you\u2019re treating your daughter like an emotional support animal, not a person with her own needs. \n\nShe did some very thoughtful things in memory of her stepbrother. She\u2019s a kid and she probably wants some normalcy for Christmas. You should have spoken with her one on one about what she needs and wants. \n\nYou\u2019re all hurting. What she said was harsh.  But maybe if you were considering her needs too, it wouldn\u2019t have come to this point \n\nShe should apologize, but it shouldn\u2019t be made a condition of where she spends Christmas. You\u2019re making her think of spending time with you and your husband as a punishment.  It\u2019s also a good way to get your ex to bring you to court over visitation and holidays", "The surge of gratefulness I feel for my parents every time I read posts similar to this one is truly remarkable. In case you had any doubt, YTA.", "YTA.  You are using your daughter as a tool to make you husband feel better.  The combination of that and interfering with her relationship with her father, you are going to lose her.", "YTA \n\nWhy is your husband's needs more important than your daughters?\n\nI get that your husband don't feel like celebrating Christmas, and that you have chosen  not to in solidarity. But why does your daughter need to miss out as well if she can go celebrate at her dad's?", " YTA. How can you be so cruel to your own daughter?  Let her go to her father.  Maybe she should move in with him permanently.", "YTA. But, you need to let your teenager go on with her life. You tried to make her see what the family was, but she is only seeing the fun of the trip. \n\nLet her go, but let her also understand that her outburst has shown Mike what she really feels about him. Let her understand that her outburst, is an example of what she feels and if she really feels like he isn't her real dad, then she needs to understand that her talking to him like that will probably affect their relationship moving forward.\n\nKids will be kids, but purposely trying to make someone feel bad is not a good look for them. \n\nYou and Mike need to bond over TJ. It seems Dana feels she can be free of you guys, at least for this trip. Make sure she understands what she has done and how it will change how things are moving forward. Make sure she understands that her \"real\" dad is just doing a temporary fun thing with/for her and Mike has been there every day for her.\n\nUltimately you should let her find out for herself. These things happen all of the time. You need to work with Mike so he can get a handle on how his loss is going to affect him moving forward, as it seems Dana has moved on from it herself.\n\nGood luck and be there for Mike as Dana will have family around her.", "YTA\n\nYour 15 year old daughter is not your husband's emotional support teen. \n\nYou take care of your kids. Your daughter is not obliged to set aside a fun Christmas with her biological father so she can help you take emotional care of your husband.", "Look, you\u2019ve dug in your heels. I\u2019m sorry girl but YTA.  Let your daughter go. Take Mike somewhere you can afford over the holiday- even if you always do this \u201cthis way\u201d do something that makes Mike comfortable- not your pride here. \n\nLet it go. Take care of Mike. Let your daughter, who has just lost her step-brother (yeah I read what you wrote). Let her go and be a kid.  \n\nI didn\u2019t read anything about what Mike might want to do for this holiday- just you, and your insistence that people do what you say in the way you want them to say it. I get it, you\u2019re grieving too. Lead the pack by apologizing to all of them and see what happens. \n\nBy the way, I am very, very sorry for your family\u2019s loss. TJ will be missed by all of you.", "YTA. Why is it her responsibility to stay in a household full of grief on Christmas? It\u2019s not her responsibility to be there because her stepbrother passed away. Mike is your problem, not hers.", "YTA. Have you done fucking anything to support Dana? Have you considered that Dana doesn\u2019t want to spend Christmas at home because she\u2019s devastated by the death of her 16 year old brother and hasn\u2019t been able to safely process because _you made it abundantly clear that the world revolves around Mike._ \n\nSpeaking of Mike, even he said to let her go, but you decided to use her presence as a bandaid on a bullet wound, and she lashed out. Of course she\u2019s not going to apologize\u2026in front of you.\n\nI guaran-damn-tee she would apologize to Mike directly if he spoke with her because she\u2019s not angry at him. She\u2019s angry that her step sibling died abruptly, she\u2019s angry because she\u2019s not being supported by her own mother, she\u2019s angry because she wants to spend time with her biological father and you decided Mike is more important to her than her father _for her._ she\u2019s been set aside and disregarded and she blew up.  Mike was unfortunately the easiest target, but rest assured, that rage was pointed _at you._\n\nIn your grief, you\u2019ve forgotten that you have a daughter in favor of mourning your son. You\u2019ve relegated her to a prop in the story of you and Mike. Fix it.", "There\u2019s exactly one thing you can do to help alleviate ANY PART OF THIS SITUATION, and that\u2019s if Mike, not you, Mike, goes in and tells her she can go, that he talked to you and you relented. You\u2019re already the bad guy in this situation, but this is the least you can do. Otherwise, you\u2019re the bad guy for pushing her to the point of saying those things, and EVERY other reason on this thread.", "You backed her into this corner, man. YTA", "YTA\n\nYour 15 year old daughter wants to have a pleasant Christmas instead of spending it in a house of mourning. This is perfectly understandable, and she is not her stepfather's emotional support animal. Let her go to her Dad's or you may be creating a rift your family won't ever fully recover from.", "YTA- and a bad parent, and just all around *fucking pathetic*", "YTA. It's not your daughter's responsibility to be emotional support for your husband.....that's your job as his partner. She should be allowed to spend her holiday with her father. What if something happens to one of them and they lost time together due to your actions? I am sorry your husband lost his son but she shouldn't be expected to step into his place.", "YTA. Denying your daughter time with her father and the other half of her family is not the way to support your grieving husband. You were not even willing to compromise or discuss arranging some special time with just the 3 of you after the trip, just flat out no both times. Your unwillingness to see your daughter's viewpoint and then doubling down with a stupid punishment is what makes you the AH", "All the commenters are right. Not only that but she could also be hurting from TJ's death too but im sure no one consoled her or put her into therapy either. \nHorrible...", "YTA. I'm not sure what you're thinking you're going to achieve with this, but it's going to backfire.", "ESH except for Mike and Dick. Your daughter is not an emotional support device. Did you ever consider maybe she NEEDS a normal, not-sad Christmas because SHE might be suffering from her own grief and the grief she\u2019s surrounded and suffocating from? Even MIKE thinks you should let her have this Christmas with her dad. She shouldn\u2019t have screamed what she did about Mike and TJ, but you pushed her to it. It\u2019d be nice if she apologized when Mike is obviously on her side, but ultimately it\u2019s your fault this happened. You can\u2019t force things like this.", "People are being way too harsh here IMO.\n\nGrief fucks with you, and it fucks with everyone differently. The OP's desperate need to have the three of them together for Christmas will likely make less sense to her in hindsight, but for right now her feelings are real. The daughter may be feeling the loss of her brother and of her happy parents, so her desire to get out of a house of grieving may be making her feel guilty and confused and desperate as well. It's all terribly sad.  \n\n\nOP, I'm sorry for what you're going through. I would suggest an honest conversation with your daughter about how fraught and ungoverned your emotions are right now. Acknowledge that she is also going through this and let her know that you understand she doesn't actually hate her brother or stepdad, but that an apology would be kind of her. And then tell her to have fun on her trip with her dad and that you love her as much as ever.  \n\n\nBest to you all.", "OP doesn't need to go easier on herself.  She tried to force her teen daughter to not get to do something fun because the adults \"need\" her, escalated it needlessly (I won't apologize for noting that \"Let's make those cookies TJ liked!\" is one of the stupidest possible things in this whole situation), and then has the gall to punish her daughter for being a teenager, having feelings, and not wanting to be put in this situation.", "I think what a lot of people forget too is that people who are cornered with no way out will shut down or fight. Dana doesn't have any power to set most boundaries or consequences with her mom or stepdad and this is akin to feeling backed into a corner for a lot of issues. Reading between the lines, it seems to me that Dana has shut down before and just accepted that she has to spend every Christmas in a morose household and who knows what else OP has made her do. But this year she tried to get a breath of fresh air and escape for a bit. When OP backed her into a corner with no way out she fought. Yes, she said hurtful things that she probably didn't mean or that could be delivered in a better way, but she's 15.

I was thinking the whole OP post that where the concern for her child who has gone through this trauma of loosing essentially a brother and seen parents grieving.
