Meanwhile, I've been divorced since 2013, but my daughter \u201cDana\u201d is still close with her bio dad \u201cDick\u201d until now.\n\nI met Mike in 2016. After we married, we had a near-perfect family, and TJ was even comfortable enough to call me mom.\n\nHowever, on April this year, TJ was hit by a drunk driver and was killed instantly. Our family was devastated.\n\nUnderstandably, Mike was inconsolable. I was the one who made the arrangements for TJ\u2019s service and made sure the drunk driver was jailed. In his grief, Mike didn\u2019t come out of the house for months. He's now seeing a therapist to help him process everything.\n\nThen, last month, Dana told me that Dick invited her to spend the holidays with him. I said no. Christmas has always been tough for Mike because of his wife\u2019s passing (Dana knows this), and now, he also lost TJ. I told Dana that we\u2019re the only family Mike has left, so we\u2019ll be celebrating Christmas at our home. She was disappointed but seemed to understand.\n\nHowever, yesterday, she pressed again. This time, over dinner with Mike. Dana said that Dick rented a vacation house where they could go skiing and do other fun stuff. However, I still said no, and I explained to her again why.\n\nAfter an hour of arguing, Dana started raising her voice. Mike intervened and said maybe I should just let Dana go. I still said no. I know Mike was just being modest and that he\u2019d be heartbroken if Dana leaves (I know I will be). I then said something like \u201cCome on Dana, this is the first time we\u2019re celebrating Christmas with just the three of us. How about we make those cookies TJ really liked?\u201d\n\nThen, to my shock, Dana replied with \u201cHe\u2019s not even my real brother! And Mike\u2019s not even my real family! I want to spend time with my real dad!\u201d then stomped her way to her room. This was the first time Dana acted like this. Mike had been nothing but kind, caring, and supportive to her. She has also told me that she feels good and safe with Mike. We even baked a cake during TJ\u2019s birthday, and Dana made a beautiful slideshow to honor him. Mike then told her how much she means to him as his daughter.\n\nI looked at Mike, who was on the verge of tears, but he just told me to let it go since it\u2019s Christmas time, and maybe Dana was just being a teenager (she\u2019s 15) and to just let her spend time with Dick.\n\nI then went to Dana\u2019s room and told her that she can spend Christmas with Dick if she apologizes to Mike. She refused, saying she didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. That\u2019s when I started to get mad. I told her that she\u2019s staying home for Christmas and that I\u2019m taking all her devices during the break. I also said she won\u2019t be joining her friend\u2019s sleepover after New Year.\n\nDick then called and said I\u2019m overreacting and that I\u2019m an AH for ruining Dana\u2019s break. However, I don\u2019t see how disciplining my child makes me an AH.\n\nSo, AITA for what I did?", "created_utc": 1702965087, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18luoqe/aita_for_punishing_my_daughter_after_she_lashed/", "score": 629, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like since the passing of his son, TJ, you want to push Dana towards Mike for him to be a father for her. When her biological father is very much in her life. That explains why everything escalated so damn fast, your overreaction, and why you're so determined to have Dana spend Christmas with Mike instead of Dick. Makes me wonder if you've done something similar before, during another holiday or event. Especially with how Dana exploded. People don't just randomly act out of character all of a sudden. There has to have been something building up over time.\n\nYour husband needs YOU, his WIFE, to give him all the love and the support he needs right now. Not you ruining everyone's Christmas by forcing people to be unhappy together. Mike knows that Dick is Dana's real father and how close they are, and he respects that. You, however, don't.\n\nIf you ruin your daughter's Christmas because of your own selfishness, you will create something that can't be stopped. You've already planted the seed of resentment inside of her. Which caused her to lash out at him, saying things she probably does regret due to her anger towards you. You will only make the love and respect Dana has for Mike diminish the more you try to force her onto him. Causing him more pain.\n\nDo better!", "YTA. You are making this about your husband and his feelings. Yes he's had a horrible run as a father and husband, no doubt. However your daughter isn't some emotional support animal to be there for his sadness.  That's incredibly selfish of you to make her do it.\n\nHow about you be there for your husband, and let her go enjoy Christmas without sadness and spending time with her dad.", "YTA.\n\n>I want to spend time with my real dad\n\nListen to her. She should be your priority, not you or your current husband. Everything about this post makes me understand why she needs to spend time away from you.", "Yta\n\nPoor Mike.\n\nHis son died and his wife destroys his relationship with his stepdaughter by treating her as an emotional support animal for him rather than as a person.", "YTA- you decided she can\u2019t spend time with her own father because YOU decided another man needs her as an emotional crutch.  You put your daughter\u2019s needs last.  Then when she lashed out (rightfully so) you pulled the authority card and punished her. Your behavior in this instance is actually immature.  It\u2019s akin to having to have the last word.  Where is the conversation? Where is compromise?  Where is even ASKING YOUR OWN CHILD HOW she feels???  Have you even helped HER process TJ\u2019s death?   She could\u2019ve been so upset by it and now she\u2019s just telling herself that there\u2019s no reason to be that upset because he wasn\u2019t even really her brother. It\u2019s a coping mechanism.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s how she feels or what is going on but you clearly haven\u2019t even bothered to ask. \n\nYou\u2019ve made it crystal clear that she is NOT your priority.", "In your efforts to console your husband, you are pushing your daughter away.

Please remember this also all happened to Dana. People grieve in different ways. And she asked for something she probably needed and then reacted like a teenager who can\u2019t express herself correctly when you shut her down. Let her go have a break from the grief. It can be overwhelming to feel the weight of adult\u2019s emotions on top of your own when you are a teen. Try to go a little easier on everyone, yourself included.", "Info: Has your daugjter not been able to spend Christmas with her dad since you married your husband?\n\nDo you guys not have a custody agreement?", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is not your husband\u2019s emotional support animal.

She does not want her Christmas to be focused on your husband and his grief.  \n\nWhat happened to your family is tragic and I can\u2019t imagine how much you are all suffering.

Keep pushing and you will permanently destroy relationships.", "YTA Let the girl spend the holiday with her dad without all the drama next time.", "YTA and the end of the day as hard as it is to hear - Mike is not her father. \nYour daughter is old enough to decide with whom she would like to spend her holiday - and this year she wants to spend it with her dad. \nYou and your husband aren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019ve had a hard year, let her go and enjoy her Christmas.\n\nEdit: at this point you\u2019re only going to have a hostile and miserable daughter for Christmas - is this worth ruining everyone\u2019s holiday? (Even Mikes, because he\u2019s obviously your first priority)", "YTA - \u201cHow about we make those cookies TJ liked\u201d tells us everything we need to know about why your daughter lashed out. You\u2019re being incredibly selfish in this situation. You\u2019re only thinking about what you want instead of the the *separate* needs of your husband and daughter. If anything, TJ\u2019s sudden death is a good reminder of why your daughter needs to spend time building memories with her bio dad. The trip is also a brief escape for a young girl who\u2019s being living in a house filled with grief for the better part of a year. Your husband is not the only one who needs support right now. Your daughter does too. And it\u2019s your job as her mother to ensure that she gets it\u2026.no matter what your husband is going through.", "YTA. She honestly lashed out because you pushed her and wouldn't take a no for an answer. You don't seem to respect her wishes, and just because you remarried does not mean she doesn't have a biological dad anymore. She's been with you guys, why isn't she allowed to have a moment with her dad? It could've been handled better instead of just making her feel like a selfish person, you need to consider it might be needed for her to de-stress instead of just staying in a grieving environment all the time. It doesn't mean she doesn't care if she wants to have a little fun during her holidays, and taking her devices is not discipline, it's just revenge.", "YTA.\n\nIt is your fault that your daughter blew up at you and her stepfather.\n\nYou are the one who needs to apologize for making everything worse.", "YTA.

Almost every kid of a stepparent I know has pulled the line \u201cyou aren\u2019t my real dad/mom\u201d, I haven\u2019t bc my ex stepdad was to scary abusive for me to do that but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s normal to happen. And it seems your husband is okay with your daughter going to her dads, so I don\u2019t understand what the problem is. I think punishment for this is an overreaction, I don\u2019t understand what she did wrong to deserve that. I think being upset that your mom isn\u2019t letting you go to your dads is perfectly understandable. Put yourself in her shoes and really listen to what she\u2019s saying, and take the moody teenager part out of that or it\u2019s going to make it worse. You are here to help her not be at war with her. Also listen to the other comments, she\u2019s not responsible to make sure your husband is happy, especially if he said it\u2019s fine I would just let her go to her dads.

How can you not see that? You wanted to deny her time with her dad because YOU wanted her to comfort her step dad. Doesn\u2019t matter how great he is or what tragic event he went through. She is a child and deserves time with her dad and does NOT need the burden of comforting adults. Ever think she\u2019d like a normal holiday without things being depressing?", "YTA .. Another reason she probably wants to spend time with dad is because she's treated like a priority at his house. Clearly it's not happening at your house were Mike is the priority. From here your relationship is probably just going to deteriorate further.", "Yta, it's not your daughters responsibility to make everyone else feel better, you havnt took her into consideration at all through any of this, it's all about what you want and what your husband needs.

Let her go to Dick\u2019s, who cares. Just have Christmas with you and Mike and watch some videos of TJ as a baby or something. Grief is really confusing and hard so I can imagine where you\u2019re coming from with Dana\u2026 did you stop to think that maybe you don\u2019t want her to go with Dick because *you* actually want her to spend Christmas with *you* because *you* are grieving TJ and this has *nothing to do with Mike*? Mike lost his only son\u2026 I can basically guarantee he wants Dana to do whatever makes her happy.\n\nVery gentle YTA, mostly because you\u2019re the adult and you were being inconsiderate/unreasonable to your child while she was properly expressing her need, desire, whatever to go spend time with her dad. You need to take a deeper look at your own emotions and role in all of this. I think you\u2019re hurting more than you\u2019re letting on. I hope you guys get through this and I highly suggest talking about your feelings around TJ\u2019s death with a therapist.", "What exactly are you disciplining her for?\n\nShe loves her father and wanted to spend Christmas with him. You wanted to force her to spend it with you and your husband because he's grieving, but she's a person, not a consolation prize. \n\nI'm very sorry for your loss. But this calls for a heart to heart talk about empathy and compassion, not punishment for the way she feels.\n\nYTA.", "Yta. Your daughter doesn\u2019t want to spend Christmas baking cookies that a dead kid liked and talking about him. She is not as emotionally invested in this new family as you are. Let her be happy with her dad and don\u2019t drag her into depression just because your husband is depressed. He will never get over the loss of his son. But it is not fair to punish your daughter with his presence.", "Soft YTA. I know you aren\u2019t doing it on purpose, but it sounds like you were prioritizing your husband\u2019s feelings over your daughter. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with that, per se, but there is something wrong with using your daughter as an emotional support child for your husband. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter made clear she wants to spend the holiday with her dad and that her dad had something fun planned. Nothing in this post suggests that there is a custody agreement that makes that not ok. And it seems like the ONLY reason you said no to your daughter is because her wishes, while good and happy for her, would make your husband sad. \n\nYour daughter, understandably, doesn\u2019t want your husband\u2019s happiness to come before her own. Maybe that is selfish but it\u2019s also u deters sable, especially from a 15 year old who had likely felt \u201cback burned\u201d since her step brother\u2019s death.\n\nWhat she said sounds mean and hurtful. It likely also wasn\u2019t true. But it was also very likely the words of an emotional teenager who is really expressing anger about feeling second or third most important right now.\n\nIt\u2019s an emotional time for everybody. Cut her some slack. I can promise trying to extort an apology out of her won\u2019t help, but letting her go and telling her you love her and asking her how she is feeling about the things that happened might help.", "YTA\n\nYou're trying to make your Husband feel better (and in doing so *give yourself* a more pleasant holiday season than you anticipate, considering the circumstances) by shoving your unwilling Daughter into his dead son's spot. You're a top-tier, selfish Asshole. Your reasoning is afflicted and your justification for punishing your daughter further is obscene. \n\nYour sweet Daughter may be reacting to her Step-Brother's death by wanting to strengthen and increase her time and bond with her own father; and there you stand waving your demanding fist fist in her face because you want her at your disposal.", "YTA. You've gone too far.\n\nI think what the kid did was appalling, no question. And your reaction to defend Mike is understandable. But just think what you've committed to do here.\n\nYou've committed to spend the holiday making the kid miserable. She's going to have an awful time, and you're going to have an awful time enforcing it, and Mike is going to have a truly miserable time watching you do it and watching this kid blame him. \n\nI think the best thing to do would probably just let her go and focus on Mike. Christmas isn't going to mean a thing to him this year anyway. I kind of understand the kid's desire to be out of there, the best you can say about this coming Christmas is that you'll get through it somehow.", "Oh wow, YTA big time. You've allowed your own emotional needs cloud your reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then, last month, Dana told me that Dick invited her to spend the holidays with him. I said no.\n\nSo your ex-husband and daughter both wanted to spend time together over Christmas, and you shut it down unilaterally? (Allegedly) because of your new husband? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I told Dana that we\u2019re the only family Mike has left, so we\u2019ll be celebrating Christmas at our home. She was disappointed but seemed to understand.\n\nJust because someone understands something doesn't mean they accept it. And it doesn't sound like you allowed for much in the way of open discussion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>After an hour of arguing, Dana started raising her voice. Mike intervened and said maybe I should just let Dana go. I still said no. I know Mike was just being modest and that he\u2019d be heartbroken if Dana leaves (I know I will be).\n\nYou argued for an hour? What was said in that hour? It's odd how you omitted one hour of conversation. And \"I know I will be\". Interesting, so you don't just want Dana to stay for Mike's sake, you also want her to stay for your own personal emotional needs.\n\nAnd have you actually asked Mike about his opinions on the matter, or merely assumed that it's essential that Dana stays with you over the Christmas holidays? Just out of curiosity, but do you think it would make Mike feel great that the only reason Dana stayed to 'support' him was because you forced her to? Because if I was buddied up with someone who wanted to be anywhere but with me, I'd feel awkward and embarrassed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then, to my shock, Dana replied with \u201cHe\u2019s not even my real brother! And Mike\u2019s not even my real family! I want to spend time with my real dad!\u201d\n\nNo doubt she said this out of anger after you had shown no interest in her own emotional need to spend time with her biological father, had refused to listen to husband Mike's opinion that perhaps Dana should go, had refused to listen to your ex-husband's desire to spend time with his daughter, and had spent an hour arguing with your daughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We even baked a cake during TJ\u2019s birthday, and Dana made a beautiful slideshow to honor him. Mike then told her how much she means to him as his daughter.\n\nIt sounds to me like Dana has done a lot of emotional labor to help Mike since his son died. I'm not saying he hasn't reciprocated with affection and love, but you need to be aware that you've essentially voluntold a teenager to be an ongoing emotional support person to a grieving adult, at her own expense. And again, I'm not even sure you want Dana to stay purely because of that, because you said *you* would be heartbroken if she went and spent Christmas with her father.\n\nAnyway, caring for Mike's emotional needs isn't Dana's responsibility, it's YOURS. YOU are his wife. If you can't meet his needs then he can talk to his therapist and adult family members (who can CHOOSE if they want to support him, and choose how much support they give)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I then went to Dana\u2019s room and told her that she can spend Christmas with Dick if she apologizes to Mike.\n\nYOU need to apologize. YOU need to acknowledge that you have been unfair to Dana, and express gratitude for how hard she has worked to help support a grieving adult.  YOU need to admit to her that you were being selfish. Because frankly you are selfish, and I think you're reacting so harshly to Dana because she's finally pushing back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She refused, saying she didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. \n\nI mean, technically she is correct. You ex-husband is her 'real' father. She expressed it in a very blunt way, but the poor girl has been imposed upon and had her wishes ignored by you for so long it's little wonder she struggled to express herself diplomatically. I'm over twice her age and would have said far worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That\u2019s when I started to get mad.\n\nThen you should have walked away and composed yourself. Way too many parents enact punishments when they are mad and haven't had a chance to calm down and empathize with their kid, and they end up imposing overly harsh punishments that they are reluctant to backtrack on because it would make them look weak and falliable. But parents aren't fooling anyone, their kids generally know when they aren't being fair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I told her that she\u2019s staying home for Christmas and that I\u2019m taking all her devices during the break. I also said she won\u2019t be joining her friend\u2019s sleepover after New Year.\n\nOh wow, do you want to absolutely nuke Mike and your relationship with Dana? She has two completely legitimate grievances (Being an adult's emotional support person for a prolonged period of time, and being denied a holiday with her father because of your and your husband's emotional needs). \n\nAnd what she said while harsh isn't exactly untrue. So you're going to be vindictive and harshly punish her for telling you a truth that you don't like, and lashing out for being unfairly imposed upon and denied a well-deserved holiday with her father?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Dick then called and said I\u2019m overreacting and that I\u2019m an AH for ruining Dana\u2019s break. \n\nYou're the AH, a selfish one at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>However, I don\u2019t see how disciplining my child makes me an AH.\n\nYou're not disciplining her, you're reacting vindictively because she won't cater to you and your husband's emotional needs, and I'm not even sure if your husband's emotional needs matter that much in your mind, since he said she probably should go. Quite frankly, **it's all about you.** You aren't fooling me, you're not even fooling the masses on Reddit, and you aren't going to fool your 15 year old.", "YTA.

Losing someone makes us realise that we can lose anybody that we care about in just a moment. She has probably internalised the fear of losing you and her father since TJ\u2019s death.

You said the holidays have always been rough for Mike since his wife died, and perhaps faced with the prospect of an even gloomier Christmas this year without TJ, she was looking forward to having a break and spending a fun holiday with her dad at the vacation house. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s much you can do for how Mike feels around the holidays, but there\u2019s still time to allow your daughter to enjoy a fun holiday memory with her dad. It\u2019s your job to comfort Mike, not your daughter\u2019s.", "OP, YTA. It sounds like you need to be taking your daughter to family therapy.\n\nWhat she said is a super normal thing that most teenagers in blended families have said at least once. You probably said it (or a variation of it if you grew up with married parents) at least once yourself.\n\nI understand that it seemed especially hurtful given the circumstances, but it's unfair to expect her not to be a teenager just because of a tragedy. In fact, I'd argue the fact that TJ was killed by a drunk driver is probably causing her more stress than if it had been something your family could prepare for. Teenagers think they're immortal. Most teenagers have to confront that belief throughout their teen years and each time it's a huge, crushing blow. But to have to confront that through the death of your step brother? That's brutal.\n\nShe's been watching her stepfather grieve in some really scary ways. It sounds like you're very anxious for him -- which makes sense -- and she's undoubtedly picking up on that. It sounds like she really likes Mike and cares for him. That's a huge burden, though, for a teenager to be worried about her stepdad and worried about her mom and reeling with her own mortality.\n\nShe wants to spend some time pretending things are normal with her dad. I'm sure if you could do that, you'd want to too. It's unreasonable of you to decide she can't because you can't. She's not an asshole for being able to pretend things are normal with her dad, she's a teenager who needs some breathing room and a break from witnessing everyone else's grief.\n\nLet her spend this time with her dad. Apologize to her for not seeing her frustration. Most teenagers double down when they say something mean, but with a little bit of space, they usually feel really guilty. If she's still not able to understand that she needs to try and be gentle with her words to Mike, that's something to address as her mom (as empathetically as you're able), but you kind of pushed her into this -- she overreacted, but she needs a break and even adults sometimes overreact when they're past their breaking point.", "YTA. Mike seems like an understanding dude and teenagers say hurtful things. However, your daughter isn\u2019t wrong. You are forcing a relationship on her she doesn\u2019t feel. Mike is your husband. Not her dad. Let her spend time with her Dad. Especially after how depressing and stressful Christmas at your house has been. Let her go be a kid. You can\u2019t punish a kid into having familial feelings for someone she doesn\u2019t.", "YTA bruh let the kid spend christmas w her dad", "YTA.

Your daughter is not an emotional support human. \n\nYes the holidays are hard when experiencing tremendous loss, but it\u2019s not your daughter\u2019s responsibility to manage that for you. She has another parent and if she wants a break from the grief in your home she should be allowed to have it. You are the one who escalated all of this and pushed her to the point of lashing out. Now you\u2019re punishing her because she isn\u2019t grieving in a way that you approve of. \n\nShe wants to spend the holidays with her father, it\u2019s not a betrayal of anyone.

You forcing her to stay home, will only make everything worse. She's 15, that's a normal age to push people away.

That is a child. She has feelings and needs, too.\n\nIt\u2019s also unfair that she doesn\u2019t get to spend the holidays with her bio dad because of the pressure you\u2019ve put on her. Mike had the good sense to say let her go. You should\u2019ve listened to him and your daughter.", "Oof, this situation is haaard. I just had a friend lose her husband with kids who are 15 and 17. Grieving is hard. The first 2-4 years of holidays after the loss are hard. Having extra attention and pressure on you because your sibling died is hard. Being 15 is hard. Having divorced parents is hard. \n\nShort term I would let her go with her dad, returns her devices and resume the NY Eve plans. She's handling grief badly - as badly as many 15 year olds handle everything - but she's probably really grieving. And reeling from the grief everyone else is radiating. It's important to remember that she can't be your emotional support. At 10 she could have and at 25 she will again but not at 15.\n\n\nLong term,  get a family therapist for everyone. You'll need to find ways to balance really really living in the present along with grieving TJ and TJs mom.  You don't want to lose your daughter because your house turns into the grief house.", "YTA.  She\u2019s a child and while your husband has some deep grief, you can\u2019t ignore hers as well. This environment must be very hard for everyone, and her request to spend some time outside of the house without constant grief is appropriate and healthy. Your pushiness in ignoring her needs is just going to cause her to lash out and want to dissociate from her source of pain. Let her go to her father\u2019s trip, and have a talk afterwards about hurting other\u2019s feelings.  The way out of this is to step into normalcy slowly, not be trapped under grief all the time. Follow her example, and book a trip for you and your husband for the holidays.", "YTA\n\nDana may have been rude in her delivery, but she's right. At 15 she should get to choose who she spends Christmas with, this year and every year. Be careful, you may not get many Christmases after she leaves home if you press on with this course of action.

For her age, saying things like that, lashing out, is a common way to compartmentalize feelings in the grieving process. Also the only reason she blew up and said hurtful thing is because you continuously pushed her and invalidated her as a person.\n\nSo now thanks to you being a massive a-hole and wanting to get your way, your daughter is miserable, your husband is miserable, your daughters father is miserable.

Rather than jumping straight into reacting to her behaviour, it would have been better to wait until emotions had settled a bit and then discussing how very hurtful it was to say those things, including acknowledging the accuracy of her statements, \u201cI know he\u2019s not your father and Tj wasn\u2019t your brother, but Mike loves you very much and to hear you say those things was very painful for him.\u201d Also showing your understanding of her wanting to be elsewhere, would have gone a long way towards helping her calm her raging emotions.\n\nShould she apologise to Mike, absolutely, should that be a condition for spending time with her dad, absolutely not.

What she said was terrible. Teenagers can lack compassion and this is an extreme case.\n\nYet, however unkind and immature, I can understand emotionally that she might want to get away from her grief-stricken family to her bio-Dad's relative comfort for a \"normal\" Christmas. As an adult, I can say the right thing to do would be to be with you as a family...however, she is not an adult and she has two families and one of them lets her escape to have some fun and to specifically get away from the grief and sadness. It's your role as a Mum to ensure your daughter has healthy emotions, and it sounds like your are very much putting your adult needs on her - and your husband's need on her. It's too much and not appropriate.  I even suspect that the awful things she said are to push away her brother and step-dad so they mean less to her so she is not so close to the pain...and also to get back at you for deciding unilaterally she cannot see her other family. This was wrong of you and a huge assumption.\n\nOn another line, it's also not clear to me that she must or even should miss enjoyable opportunities in her own life because of the death of her brother. Again, I think this was an assumption you made, but it's not clear this ought to be the case. I think you're assuming a lot about your \"family\" experience of this loss versus Dana's experience. For example, you suggested you could make TJ's favorite cookies, and this speaks to how you want to process your grief, but what if this would be extremely triggering to Dana?\n\nWhat she said was terrible, but I suggest you put it to the side and try and find some curiosity about where it came from and what her sincere perspective is and don't try to force her to grieve with you at Christmas. I say this in part because I think it might help your family in the long-run and defuse this becoming a theme of push and pull and resentment.\n\nYou all need support, love, therapy, and spiritual support if you lean that way.\n\nWishing you and your family peace.", "YTA.

You're not disciplining your child by punishing her for telling the truth.\n\nI agree that she did it in a wrong way and your job is to make her see that for herself. You cannot just say \"go apologize!\". Because what does that matter if she does not believe in the apology? Does that make your daughter a better person?\n\nAnd it's simply not your daughter's responsibility to be an emotional crutch for your husband. You should NEVER put that kind of stress on a child.

Meanwhile, I've been divorced since 2013, but my daughter \u201cDana\u201d is still close with her bio dad \u201cDick\u201d until now.\n\nI met Mike in 2016. After we married, we had a near-perfect family, and TJ was even comfortable enough to call me mom.\n\nHowever, on April this year, TJ was hit by a drunk driver and was killed instantly. Our family was devastated.\n\nUnderstandably, Mike was inconsolable. I was the one who made the arrangements for TJ\u2019s service and made sure the drunk driver was jailed. In his grief, Mike didn\u2019t come out of the house for months. He's now seeing a therapist to help him process everything.\n\nThen, last month, Dana told me that Dick invited her to spend the holidays with him. I said no. Christmas has always been tough for Mike because of his wife\u2019s passing (Dana knows this), and now, he also lost TJ. I told Dana that we\u2019re the only family Mike has left, so we\u2019ll be celebrating Christmas at our home. She was disappointed but seemed to understand.\n\nHowever, yesterday, she pressed again. This time, over dinner with Mike. Dana said that Dick rented a vacation house where they could go skiing and do other fun stuff. However, I still said no, and I explained to her again why.\n\nAfter an hour of arguing, Dana started raising her voice. Mike intervened and said maybe I should just let Dana go. I still said no. I know Mike was just being modest and that he\u2019d be heartbroken if Dana leaves (I know I will be). I then said something like \u201cCome on Dana, this is the first time we\u2019re celebrating Christmas with just the three of us. How about we make those cookies TJ really liked?\u201d\n\nThen, to my shock, Dana replied with \u201cHe\u2019s not even my real brother! And Mike\u2019s not even my real family! I want to spend time with my real dad!\u201d then stomped her way to her room. This was the first time Dana acted like this. Mike had been nothing but kind, caring, and supportive to her. She has also told me that she feels good and safe with Mike. We even baked a cake during TJ\u2019s birthday, and Dana made a beautiful slideshow to honor him. Mike then told her how much she means to him as his daughter.\n\nI looked at Mike, who was on the verge of tears, but he just told me to let it go since it\u2019s Christmas time, and maybe Dana was just being a teenager (she\u2019s 15) and to just let her spend time with Dick.\n\nI then went to Dana\u2019s room and told her that she can spend Christmas with Dick if she apologizes to Mike. She refused, saying she didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. That\u2019s when I started to get mad. I told her that she\u2019s staying home for Christmas and that I\u2019m taking all her devices during the break. I also said she won\u2019t be joining her friend\u2019s sleepover after New Year.\n\nDick then called and said I\u2019m overreacting and that I\u2019m an AH for ruining Dana\u2019s break. However, I don\u2019t see how disciplining my child makes me an AH.\n\nSo, AITA for what I did?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Quit being so selfish and trying to act like you\u2019re being selfless. Who did she spend Christmas with last year? Typically kids alternate. Dana just wants ONE day of normalcy. Also, I feel like Mike seeing YOUR child opening gifts and doing all the Christmas things will only cause further hurt on his end because it\u2019s a reminder his son isn\u2019t there with them. Also, her LIVING father who WANTS to spend time with his child is just being swept under the rug. What if (heaven forbid) something were to happen to Dana before next Christmas?

While OP is over reacting I believe there were better ways to have figured this out. Making the child jealous by feeding her more info and making her try to change OP\u2019s mind is not right and the pushing by OP to stay home is not right because the daughter is right, it\u2019s not the daughters responsibility to be SD\u2019s therapist.
