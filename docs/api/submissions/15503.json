I mean saying Hispanics come from Spain and therefore they are the colonizers is a bit... Simplistic. \n\nLet's start with defining Hispanic. That just means they come from a country that speaks Spanish. Nothing related with race. That means Hispanics might be white, black, indian and any mixture and combination because at the end of the day it's more about having a common culture and background than race. \n\nYes, the common language is Spanish and they were colonies of Spain. But contrary to what happened in North America, many Hispanic countries maintained big indigenous populations. Also, the natives, Spanish and black populations intermarried more compared to USA, for example. The result is that in many Hispanic countries people are just mixed, with no clear ancestry (mestizo). This is not the case for all Hispanic countries, of course (ex. Argentina and Chile), but even then these countries where colonies under a foreign influence which destabilised their economies and destroyed their previous culture. \n\nSo yes, Hispanics might sometimes have Spanish ancestry. But that does not mean they do not suffer from racism (they might be non-white) or that they did not suffer under colonialism. \n\nThis still does not justify the kids being mean to other kids based on race, but I just wanted to clarify that Hispanics did live under colonizers and did historically suffer the consequences of that. \n\nSorry if I went in a bit of a rant here.
