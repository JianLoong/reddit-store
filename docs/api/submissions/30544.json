I loved him and at one point saw myself growing old with him. But that obviously didn\u2019t happen and I\u2019ll tell you why.\n\nI got a job immediately after we graduated but he didn\u2019t. He was holding out for a better job and better pay than what was being offered. He spent most of his time in our apartment playing  World of Warcraft and snacking. This was back when WoW was a thing and he was the guild leader of a raiding guild. I earned and paid for most things while his parents were giving him $300 a week. He also gained about 50 pounds from the time we graduated. One day I came home from a hard day at work and wanted to go out to dinner. He refused to go because he had a raid to lead so I went by myself. When I came home, I packed my things and went to my sister\u2019s and he didn\u2019t even noticed. We eventually broke up and haven\u2019t seen or talked to each other since then.\n\nThis weekend I went to a mutual friend\u2019s wedding and knew my ex would also be there. I was shocked when I saw that he not only lost all of the extra weight but gained it all back in muscles. From the conversations with our friends, I found out that he\u2019s the president of a hospital in the largest healthcare group in our state. He\u2019s also married and his very pregnant wife was by his side. She was happy the entire weekend because he was constantly serving her. They\u2019re the happy family we were meant to be.\n\nI got more and more annoyed as the night wore on and after I couple of drinks, I walked up to him as he was at the bar and tore into him. I told him I was extremely hurt he didn\u2019t bother to better himself while we were engaged which would have saved our relationship. Our friends pulled me away and I left soon afterwards.\n\nThe bride understands my feelings but is still mad that I did it at her wedding. The groom is incense and have barred me from anything they\u2019re hosting until I publicly apologize. I think I might have overstepped a bit but it was justified.", "created_utc": 1699405236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17q9rg3/aita_for_telling_at_my_ex_at_a_wedding_he_did/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems reasonable.  Then he grew up and became less of a loser.  This is pretty normal.  He found someone who he loves and acted responsibly.  He also hit the gym.  This is all normal life stuff.  Your ex didn't purposefully become less shitty of a person to spite you.  He grew up.  It's time for you to do the same.  Also causing a huge scene at someone's wedding is tacky and lame.", "YTA - You don't cause a scene at a wedding.  \n\nAlso whether your ex is doing better for himself now or not isn't anything to do with you. It's not unusual for some people to flounder a bit after leaving university and take some time to find their place. You decided you didn't want to deal with that (which is fine). You don't get to complain to him for eventually finding his place and moving on. You absolutely were not justified in what you did.", "YTA. \n\nOne of the absolute worst times to bring this up. It's a wedding. It's also in the past from years ago. He's moved on and clearly you haven't. You embarrassed yourself and you took a little away from your friend's wedding. \n\nI would apologize to the bride and groom for how you behaved. \n\nI would also strongly encourage you to see a therapist to work through how this breakup has clearly impacted you and continues to impact you today. The past clearly isn't in the past for you and it might negatively impact your future if you don't learn to move on.", "YTA - You have unresolved feelings, but that was not the place to get them out.", "More info needed.\n\nIf he was the main tank, then you would be TA because that would have massive repercussions on the raid if he wasn\u2019t there. If he was a hunter or rogue, then you were fully justified in your anger because he would have been useless in the raid.", "YTA\n\nYou were bitter and jealous. I can't believe you acted out at their (your friends) wedding. People learn and grow that's what makes people so great. It's your issue not his.\n\nEdit to clarify.", "YTA.\nChrist, you need to apologize", "YTA\n\nYou ruined someone's wedding with your personal drama, doesn't matter if you were right or not.\n\nNow, if you had pulled him to a private room and tore into him, I have no issue with that at all.  But you didn't, you tore into him at the bar in front of everyone completely fucking ruining the vibe of the most important day of the newlywed couple's life.\n\nI do not like our new society in which everyone feels their emotions and lives are so much more important than anyone else's and we all act like entitled children based on our feelings at the moment.\n\nLastly, understand that human beings are the sum of our successes and FAILURES.  Have you heard the parable about the butterfly hatching from its chrysalis and then a human happens by and pulls him out?  The butterfly develops deformed and dies.  My point?  Sometimes, we have to go through some shit in order to become the best versions of ourselves.  In his case, **it is extremely likely it took the pain of you leaving him to force him to look in the mirror and change his life and he would NOT be the man he is today without the pain of your breakup and leaving him like you did.**  In fact, if you were to go back in time and NOT leave him, I'd bet he would never have changed...\n\nso don't be mad, it is just fate and the way life works.\n\nFor instance, it is likely that you will have an emotional evolution after the mistake of you fucking up someone's wedding like a child throwing a tantrum and that your evolution would not be possible without you having made this mistake.", "YTA. \n\nYour feelings are fair enough. But you were in no way justified to approach him and voice them. What he's done since you broke up is none of your business and has nothing to do with you.

Bc you seemingly left him just for gaining some weight & not settling for any old job. Well, it looks like the joke is on you bc he found that job he was holding out for & weight can be lost. \n\nIf you had showed up & he was a still single fat boy, would that have made you feel good? Reaffirmed in your decision? \n\nYou seem jealous & miserable tbh. Move on with your life, as he has. What you did was batshit insane.", "YTA.\n\nIt was not justified at all. The guy finally matured. I mean...you've been broken up for more than a dozen years (based on WoW popularity).", "Uh, yes, YTA.\n\nIt might hurt that he chose to better himself when it was too late for your relationship, but he clearly wasn't as invested as you were, or he would have changed back then. There was no happy family for you and him as he was never interested in making that true.\n\nPlenty of people wish their early partners were better or more capable or more mature and they just aren't and aren't open to changing at the time.\n\nWhat they don't do, is shout at them at a wedding about it. His choices are not a reflection on you or about you, he's just grown up and matured from his teens/early adult years.", "YTA - I don\u2019t know what your relationship was like back when he was snacking and immersed in WoW. HOWEVER, could it possibly be that he was excessively snacking and gaming because he was trying to cope with you?

You\u2019re now just upset that you let a good one get away.", "YTA how much of a child are you still?    your obvious jealousy does not give you the right to carry on at someone else's wedding. So he moved on and bettered himself.  You would have liked to post differently wouldn't you?   You would have said how he is still a loser and look how I was right to leave. \n\n That was childish immature and spiteful. Grow up. Apologies are needed big  time, but don't be surprised when they are not accepted and you are not forgiven.", "YTA. Your ex doesn\u2019t belong to you.. he made life choices that have nothing to do with you and built a lovely life that has nothing to do with you.

Don't be jaded over \"that should have been my life\", he didn't want you in that life.", "I just experienced second hand embarressment for OP reading this post. Not everything is about you OP. Clearly you were not the only unhappy one in the relationship. He obviously did a lot of growing up after the breakup and found someone who makes him happy. Good for him. It is never too late for OP to do the same. You can be better than this cringy person who is so hung up on her ex that she dumped that she makes a scene at a wedding over it. Because I can guarantee, if he had any regrets about the way he behaved in your relationship, you just confirmed you did him a massive favour breaking up and he dodged a bullet. YTA.", "lol obviously YTA. you got drunk at a friend's wedding, jealous that your ex improved themselves and then started a fight.\n\nFWIW - nothing makes me happier than seeing my ex wife doing really well because it means our splitting up was the right decision.", "YTA - he moved on.  You didn\u2019t.  Then you ruined a wedding. I love how one of the reasons you hate him is because he got successful and hot.  So not only are you an AH for the way you acted but you are also superficial and shallow.  \n\nYour bitterness tastes great at weddings.  YTA.", "YTA.  Alcohol doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't already do - it just lowers your inhibitions.  \n\nYou left him.  Did it occur to you at any point that was a wake up call for him?  Maybe he realised he needed to get his crap together.  So he did.  He moved on with his life - and he was the one that was dumped, which is usually the harder side to be on.  \n\nI notice you didn't put your age in, or how long it had been since you dumped him, but it sounds like years - he did not get to the job he is in, get cut in the gym, married, and 'heavily pregnant' in a few weeks.  I get why you dumped him - the weight and the video games were a part of it, but it sounds like he just wasn't into the relationship - if his online friends and a game were more important than you, and the fact he 'didn't notice' that you had left.   You didn't mention how much time has passed because that makes you look bad - that you are still hung up on this after all this time, when you are the one who chose to leave.\n\nYou had some domestic bliss fantasy of life - finish college, get married and have some kids - he obviously didn't at that time, but he has those things now and you don't - you just sound jealous and churlish.  And to 'confront' him at someone elses wedding?  That makes you a straight up AH.", "\"I act like an unhinged person and harassed my ex and his wife due to jealously, AITA?\"\n\nWhy do you even bother asking?", "YTA.

You got drunk and made an ass out of yourself at someone else's wedding because your ex moved on. Did you expect him to continue living slovenly and lazily because you were suddenly out of his life?

YTA here. \n\nYou could have turned off the Wi-Fi or disconnected the phone back then. Holding onto anger is only hurting you, not him.

This wedding had nothing to do with either of you.  \n\nSo what he bettered himself and met someone new.  This happens all the time.  He did nothing at that wedding to warrant an attack. He spent the whole night with his wife and never even approached you. \n\nYet for some reason you deemed it necessary to waltz up to him and scream at him for what?  Oh yes moving on with his life after you two ended things.  Grow up you aren\u2019t the main character in his life story anymore.", "YTA. Serving \"truths\" like that while under the influence is seldom a good idea. To do it at a wedding, in front of his pregnant wife, is unforgiveable. You and he were obviously never destined to be a happy family, and if he didn't see this clearly, I am sure he sees it now. It is normal for young people to make mistakes. Engagements exist so that you will not have to live the rest of your life in a relationship that isn't right for you.", "You think you over stepped? You better believe you did. YTA", "YTA big time.

Sometimes you\u2019re in a rut, he had his lazy days, and is thriving now. \n\nMaybe a pointless comment, but I doubt a person who yells at people at weddings leaving him was his wake up call, I think he probably just got his job and decided the post college chill gap was over", ">Though honestly, this sounds like some bad Dhar Man fiction.\n\nSomeone needs to act out AITAs Dhar Man fashion. OTT acting and all.", "\u201cIf I would\u2019ve known he\u2019d be jacked and doing well I would\u2019ve waited, I\u2019m mad at him for it not making it more clear he\u2019d be this way in a few years\u201d", ">If you had showed up & he was a still single fat boy, would that have made you feel good? Reaffirmed in your decision?\n\nDefinitely she was expecting the situation to be the other way around - he was supposed to be moping about what he'd lost when she turned up looking fit and fabulous.  He wasn't supposed to be happy!!!", "Op is probably single and lonely and can't understand why.", "How is he a good one when in there relationship he was neglectful and angry. She was an asshole for the wedding but acting like this guy wasn\u2019t a bum is hilarious.", "The reason why is *because* she dumped him. I bet if they had stayed together, he never would have bettered himself.", "clearly has some leadership and management potential. he was also getting offers so not like he wasn\u2019t doing anything", "Right!? Tear into him for what? Not wallowing in sorrow & locking himself away to get fatter & broker when she left him? That's clearly what she wanted. What a miserable person. Any ex worth a shit would've simply said congratulations & kept it moving.", "Lol, and what OP fails to realize is that if they had stayed together, he may have very well never become the man he is today. He may have stayed the man who was unhappy but unsure what to do about it, and kept on doing the couple things he knew would feel good, playing games & eating pizza. Clearly, they weren't their best selves with each other, a good job & a 6 pack years later don't change that fact.", "That is impossible to know and irrelevant"]}
