I'll give you parking but not a bathroom stall.", "Why shouldn't someone with an invisible disability be able to use a disabled toilet just because they can use a normal toilet if there's no queue? Some invisible disabilities involve urgency in getting to a toilet. They may be able to use a normal toilet, and may be kind enough to use a normal toilet when there is no queue to ensure the disabled toilet is free for someone else to use. However, when there is a queue, and the person's disability means that they are physically unable to wait that long, they have every right to use the disabled toilet. \n\nAfter all that is the purpose of the disabled toilet, so people who have difficulty with toilets in public, either through physical difficulties, or uncontrollable urgency to go, can go to the toilet easily. Regardless of whether you can see their disability or not. \n\nWhen I was younger I suffered really badly from anxiety attacks. It was to the point it was essentially a disability as it effected every aspect of my life, every day. I would take six hours for me to be able to leave the house at my worst. Unfortunately, my symptoms focused on needing to go to the toilet. So every time I got anxious I desperately needed to go to the the toilet. I never used a disabled toilet as at the time I didn't realise it could be classed as a disability. Standing in a long queue, having an anxiety attack, feeling like I was about to loose control of my bladder or bowels in public, added to the anxiety, which then made the urgency to get to the toilet even worse. \n\nIf I'd known I could have used the disabled toilet, I wouldn't have gotten so anxious when I went out. It would have made being able to live my life easier, which is the point of disabled toilets. Again, if there hadn't been a queue, I'd still have used a normal toilet. But having that option would have eased my anxiety, and possibly helped me recover from and overcome the anxiety faster. So it's important for people with invisible disabilities, who can still use normal toilets when there's no queue, to be able to use the disabled toilet when there is a queue and there is an urgency they can't control.", "I strongly disagree with you saying that bowel diseases are not the same as mobility issues in terms of bathroom access. Your ability to wait or queue to use the bathroom isn\u2019t necessarily affected by a mobility issue the way it is with bowel diseases and there is no specific hierarchy between the two in terms of how disabling they may be.\n\nNeeding space because of mobility aids (e.g. wheelchair, grab bars etc) and needing urgent access due to a bowel condition are equally valid reasons to use a disabled stall and whilst it would generally be considerate to use a non-disabled stall if possible, where there is too much urgency for that for someone with an invisible disability it would be just as assholish for a mobility-impaired person to call someone with an invisible disability names for using the bigger stall as it is for a non-disabled person to call people names for the same reason.\n\nHaving a disability of one\u2019s own doesn\u2019t give a person a pass for dismissing others\u2019 disabilities - whether an invisible disability is valid or not is not a judgement that either you or your quadriplegic friend are entitled to make for a stranger.", "I agree with this as a courtesy, but it still doesn\u2019t give this woman the right to fight with a teenager about it.", "It can feel \\*wrong\\* to identify as disabled enough to use the toilets, parking etc meant for disabled people.

But the bathrooms are not restricted to only the most disabled, but also for people who simply struggle to use the normal ones, and as overflow when there are a lot of people in there.", "Yes it\u2019s the noise of others using it and when she\u2019s in a stall, the noise echoes. \n\nShe has sensory processing disorder so it\u2019s a combination of noise and changes in the air (almost like a change in air pressure). So she can\u2019t even use/be around them while wear ear defenders.", "Uh. But OP has Crohn\u2019s, which is a disability in itself, and one which quite often means that if a sufferer has to wait in line for a bathroom they\u2019re likely to have an embarrassing and public accident in a way that would not happen to somebody without a disability affecting the digestive system.\n\nYes, on occasion if there are other disabled people using the dedicated stalls then that\u2019s a risk anyway but it\u2019s much reduced if everybody else waits in line for the regular toilets according to their capability, rather than their willingness, to wait.", "The disabled person will have to wait in line longer because a non disabled person is using the only toilet they (disabled person) physically can use? Is that what you mean? Because if so, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool. Just me though", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Didn\u2019t say OP was an asshole. Woman who yelled is", "Never brought up anything to do with the law. No clue why you did", "Oh no, absolutely. That woman was a massive AH. Don't harass people using the restroom is also an important rule.", "op states she is disabled. what more do you want from her? that's how it sometimes works in restrooms. someone has to use the handicap stall because it's handicap accessible, not exclusive, to keep the line moving. op used it because she is disabled.", "I'm referring to your statement \"you do run the risk of being called an AH by someone in a wheelchair who is waiting outside\"", "Because there is no reason for anybody to get mad if a stall is in use in the bathroom and they have to wait in line like everyone else lol. So wanted to make sure you understood no laws are being violated since it seems to be a serious issue for you.", "Very true!", "Okay, I disagree but that\u2019s totally fine. Sounds like this event didn\u2019t harm anyone so it\u2019s all good.", "Oh yeah. Happened to me before my friends accident. I enjoyed the big stall and took my time to open the door and see a gentleman in a wheelchair waiting for me. Darn right I was the asshole", "Oh okay, thanks for letting me know", "They aren\u2019t just for people in wheelchairs this is what pisses me off as someone with IBD I too am ENTITLED to use those facilities just as much as your friend. Your friend is entitled to use the the ACCESSIBLE toilet but they are NOT entitled to exclusive use.\nAnd btw you don\u2019t get to agree or disagree on what you count as \u201cdisabled enough\u201d ass", "\ud83d\udc4d"]}
