I'll give you parking but not a bathroom stall.", "Why shouldn't someone with an invisible disability be able to use a disabled toilet just because they can use a normal toilet if there's no queue? Some invisible disabilities involve urgency in getting to a toilet. They may be able to use a normal toilet, and may be kind enough to use a normal toilet when there is no queue to ensure the disabled toilet is free for someone else to use. However, when there is a queue, and the person's disability means that they are physically unable to wait that long, they have every right to use the disabled toilet. \n\nAfter all that is the purpose of the disabled toilet, so people who have difficulty with toilets in public, either through physical difficulties, or uncontrollable urgency to go, can go to the toilet easily. Regardless of whether you can see their disability or not. \n\nWhen I was younger I suffered really badly from anxiety attacks. It was to the point it was essentially a disability as it effected every aspect of my life, every day. I would take six hours for me to be able to leave the house at my worst. Unfortunately, my symptoms focused on needing to go to the toilet. So every time I got anxious I desperately needed to go to the the toilet. I never used a disabled toilet as at the time I didn't realise it could be classed as a disability. Standing in a long queue, having an anxiety attack, feeling like I was about to loose control of my bladder or bowels in public, added to the anxiety, which then made the urgency to get to the toilet even worse. \n\nIf I'd known I could have used the disabled toilet, I wouldn't have gotten so anxious when I went out. It would have made being able to live my life easier, which is the point of disabled toilets. Again, if there hadn't been a queue, I'd still have used a normal toilet. But having that option would have eased my anxiety, and possibly helped me recover from and overcome the anxiety faster. So it's important for people with invisible disabilities, who can still use normal toilets when there's no queue, to be able to use the disabled toilet when there is a queue and there is an urgency they can't control.", "I strongly disagree with you saying that bowel diseases are not the same as mobility issues in terms of bathroom access. Your ability to wait or queue to use the bathroom isn\u2019t necessarily affected by a mobility issue the way it is with bowel diseases and there is no specific hierarchy between the two in terms of how disabling they may be.\n\nNeeding space because of mobility aids (e.g. wheelchair, grab bars etc) and needing urgent access due to a bowel condition are equally valid reasons to use a disabled stall and whilst it would generally be considerate to use a non-disabled stall if possible, where there is too much urgency for that for someone with an invisible disability it would be just as assholish for a mobility-impaired person to call someone with an invisible disability names for using the bigger stall as it is for a non-disabled person to call people names for the same reason.\n\nHaving a disability of one\u2019s own doesn\u2019t give a person a pass for dismissing others\u2019 disabilities - whether an invisible disability is valid or not is not a judgement that either you or your quadriplegic friend are entitled to make for a stranger.", "I agree with this as a courtesy, but it still doesn\u2019t give this woman the right to fight with a teenager about it.", "It can feel \\*wrong\\* to identify as disabled enough to use the toilets, parking etc meant for disabled people.

She didn't deserve that.", "Literally, during a flare yes someone with Crohn\u2019s can have an accident waiting for a bathroom. It\u2019s part of why it\u2019s considered a disabling condition: it affects everyday life to the extent it counts as a disability because availability of facilities and timing of events (e.g. waiting for the end of a movie or the interval in a play) and so on need to be considered and where the required access to a bathroom isn\u2019t available the sufferer\u2019s everyday activities are severely restricted.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s sometimes possible to ask to cut in line if there\u2019s no alternative but not always and with it being a hidden disability, using the disabled facilities is often the first and best option if there\u2019s a wait for the regular ones.\n\nFor someone who gets food poisoning or a virus, this is an inconvenience; you might be able to ask to skip a queue here or there if it happens and rely on the other people present being charitable.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t a disability and waiting it out for a couple of days or just sucking it up when you have to ask or if you have an accident is embarrassing won\u2019t severely impact your life. But when you\u2019re forced to risk embarrassment or have to leave activities urgently on a daily or weekly basis *for life* it\u2019s a different question.\n\nYou have to take a bigger risk occasionally in order to take a longer car journey (many sufferers of IBD or Crohn\u2019s will intentionally fast or dehydrate themselves to mitigate the risk if there\u2019s a real need to be out of range of facilities but I\u2019m sure you can appreciate that\u2019s not practical every day) or to participate in certain activities but doing that daily is exhausting and can be dangerous.\n\nA queue of 10 people using the regular stalls is not only much more likely to happen than the disabled facilities being occupied, it may well take longer than waiting for one person to finish up in the disabled stall.\n\nSo the options are to try and skip the queue for the regular stalls if people are feeling kind about it, or to use the disabled facilities when there\u2019s a queue you know you can\u2019t wait through.\n\nOne of those options requires you to disclose a fairly intimate and often embarrassing medical condition to strangers; not to mention having those strangers hear/smell the result of your condition while they wait. The other does not.\n\nSince the law is designed to protect not only access but dignity for disabled people, using the disabled stall is an adequate way to eliminate the very vast majority of the risk.\n\nYour reduction to \u201cthere should always be a spare stall\u201d is therefore taking it too far; eliminating 99% of the risk is a reasonable and generally workable accommodation - eliminating 100% is not. So as a sufferer of that kind of condition you take the 1% chance that there won\u2019t be another disabled person in the facilities as part of life, and it enables far greater access to everyday activities like shopping, eating out, attending events and travelling.", "sorry, i'm confused. why should bryce let anjie go ahead of him?", "Yeah I asked what I asked because I was interested in learning about it from someone who sees it (you).

My knowledge is 2nd hand really, I have 2 friends who have Crohn\u2019s one of whom has it well managed (after maybe 15 years of trial and error with drugs, diet and lifestyle) and the other of whom keeps getting tripped up by stress (caring for a parent with the same condition and some dementia), badly-labelled foods (lactose is a trigger), intolerance to some of the usual treatments, and incomplete accommodations in the workplace (e.g no ladies toilets on the floor where her office is situated).\n\nOther factors such as hormones (particularly for teens but more lifelong for women, including pregnancy) aging, and mobility can affect both severity and how disabling a flare can be, so it\u2019s not always a stable condition; if your mobility is also somewhat limited like OPs on occasion then managing and planning bathroom breaks becomes a lot harder.\n\nLikewise having a job with a long commute might be more disabling than working from home because getting stuck in traffic can mean being out of range too long and having an, um, explosive disagreement over the car seat.\n\nDiagnosis can be by symptoms (discomfort, bloating, blood in poop etc), colonoscopy (to see the damage) biopsy or MRI to see any irregularities in the surface of the bowel. Blood tests can also assess severity if it\u2019s bad enough to cause vitamin or mineral deficiencies through malabsorption of food, so doctors will usually also ask about your diet to see if those nutrients are just not in your diet or if you\u2019re eating them but your body isn\u2019t taking them up.\n\nThere are specific signs for other sorts of bowel disease too: for example coeliac disease causes a characteristic flattening of the villi which is often diagnosed by biopsy.
