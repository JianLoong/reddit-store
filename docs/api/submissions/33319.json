My dad has a lot of money but he can be controlling with it \n2. My mom cheated on him with my stepdad when I was 3\n\nWhen my mom and dad broke up (they were never married) instead of him paying her child support, he bought a house and told her she can live here rent free until I (20f) was 18. He still paid some child support but since he was paying for everything related to the house it wasn\u2019t much. He still paid for everything for me tho. He bought my clothes and toys and school supplies when I was with him. He sent birthday and Christmas gifts to my house on top of having me open them at his house. The only thing is he swore that he\u2019d never give anything to my stepdad or his kids. He has 3 from a previous marriage and 3 with my mom. \n\nWhen I turned 18 he started charging them market rent. They also have to pay for utilities, maintenance, hoa, etc. and he\u2019s not sending groceries anymore. Just to spite my mom, he\u2019s giving me all of her rent money but told me and her all financial support will stop if I give her any money (I really can\u2019t afford that because he pays for everything for me. \n\nMy mom was getting by until her husband decided to buy a Tesla because he hated that I had a nicer car than him. Then he saw a dog he wanted and is paying $1000+ per month to train and entertain the demon. Now they\u2019re struggling. I tried to help out the best I can. My mom is low income and on paper my dad doesn\u2019t exist (that\u2019s another story) so I get a pretty good financial aid package at my school. I give my mom $200 a month in gas and groceries, stop at the campus food pantry every week, I give her the money from my Pell grant (little over 3k a year), and use my bookstore credits to get school supplies and Christmas gifts for my half siblings. I also decide to buy my half siblings enough shampoo, body wash, conditioner, face wash, etc. to last a few months but told them I won\u2019t be buying any more unless I see that they\u2019re at least trying to work to get their own stuff. \n\nThen I found out my mom was letting my half siblings into my room when I wasn\u2019t home to use/take my stuff. I set up a camera and confronted her about it but she said I had to share because I can afford this stuff, they can\u2019t, and I don\u2019t even have to work for it (I do have a job). She kept letting them in so I stopped giving her any money except for a $50 Walmart card for my share of utilities. I don\u2019t go to the campus food pantry anymore and I didn\u2019t use my technology credit or bookstore credits for Christmas gifts. \n\nNow my mom is saying I\u2019m acting just like my dad and has been pretty rude to me lately because of it.

You should not be giving them *any* money. If they can buy a Tesla and an expensive dog, lack of money isn't the problem. The problem is lack of sense, and no amount of money will cure that. \n\nDon't throw your money down the drain. They're the kind of people you read about who win the lottery but end up bankrupt in a year.", "NTA. Your mom had 18 years to plan ahead. She knew the gravy train was going to come to an end and to rely on her child to take care of her, especially with a husband that is wildly irresponsible with money, is gross. My hope and dream is that you can move out. Your own studio apartment is better than having a room at that house. Good luck. Again, NTA, at all.", "Generally, I hate people who try to dictate how others live their lives as a condition of fulfilling financial obligations to their kids.  But, not wanting the person who cheated on you to get a penny more of your money than you have to pay them is perfectly fair. \n\nYour mom created all of her own problems, let her deal with them and focus on your education so you never end up like her.  \n\nNTA", "NTA...No matter what your father does, and what your father gives to you, you are not responsible for your mother.  She has had years and years to put her life together. I feel like you already give her too much.", "lol NTA, she can get a job. They need to learn from the consequences of their actions.", "NTA.\n\nWhat your Dad gives to you is for you. While he can't dictate how you use it, it isn't \"controlling\" to manage his money how he likes. It sounds like he runs a tight ship and knows how to manage his affairs. \n\nHe isn't obligated to his former spouse, and by your own account he has provided constant support to you, without issue.\n\nYour Mom is being petty because your Dad was true to his word: Once kiddo is an adult, he shut off the gravy train on the free housing. They had all the warning in the world this was going to happen, and your step-Dad squanders money on a novelty car and a dog...while your Mom is \"low income\"? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\n\nNTA. Move out when you can, you will be made to feel worse and worse as time goes on. Good luck.", "NTA. Don't give her your Pell grant money wth!?? Talk to your dad. Move everything you own into a storage unit and cut your mom off. She is taking advantage of you financially. She has a husband and a job and if they can afford a Tesla, they don't need your FEDERALLY FUNDED Pell grant.", "NTA. Your mom and stepdad had a really good deal going. A rent free house was worth far more than any child support your father would\u2019ve paid. If they had been saving the monthly rent they weren\u2019t paying for housing they would probably have close to 200,000 in the bank, but that\u2019s neither here or there. Since your father is turning over all of the rent money to you, you should be able to afford a nice little apartment. It\u2019s time to move out and get away from the whole situation going on at your mother\u2019s house.", "NTA.  your mom and her husband can afford things.  obviously - he bought a new tesla and an expensive dog.  their priorities are in the wrong place.  it isn't your responsibility to take care of your siblings.  she isn't respecting your space, or just you in general.  you may be acting like your dad, but that's a compliment, IMO.  you aren't being stingy, you're setting boundaries.  put a lock on your door, and threaten to tell your dad you've been supporting her other kids if she doesn't stop letting them use your things without your permission.", "This is a horrible way to grow up.In this World Peopie are either \u201c Givers\u201d or \u201c Users\u201d.Your Mom is a \u201cUser\u201d .I hope you decide to move soon OP and get away from the Drama.You are being made responsible for things that have nothing to do with you.Plus the shenanigans with your grants.Get free and get away OP.Your Mom is going to try to milk that gravy train as long as she can.", "NTA\n\nTell your mom thats she's still acting like the entitled woman who cheated on your dad.\n\n*Edit* Also your stepdad is a childish idiot for making stupid purchases.", "NTA.

It is not your responsibility for your mom's choices. It is here choices that got here in this situation.  I do understand you love her and she is your mom, but if she is allowing your step siblings to go into your room and take stuff that is not there, that is a huge issue.  What else is happening that you don't know.    So why do you still live with your mom and not your father?  If your father is willing to pay you their rent find a place of your own with that money.,", "Your mom lacks money because she lacks sense. She cheated on a wealthy man, got a Tesla (err, LOL!), and got a dog that needs training. If you don't cut the financial strings now she'll just grow more and more dependent on you.

There is a lot of bad blood between your father and your mother.  For whatever reason, they've both decided to use you to try to score points on each other.  \n\nThis is not an acceptable situation in any way, shape or form.  The best thing for you to do is to move in with your father, or else move to a living situation that precludes you from being a football or middleman between your two biological parents.", "Why are you giving them your grant money? YTA for giving them the money that you get from the government to cover college expenses.", "Your mom and her new spouse have obvious issues. Your dad, while he started well in the right, is coming perilously close to overplaying his hand for AH judgment purposes. What you, OP, should take from all this is as follows:\n\nYou should live your life as you see fit, and spend your money as you see fit. But actions have consequences for everybody. If your dad is as vindictive* as he sounds, you may find yourself on the bad side of his anger. And if your mom\u2019s anger. Which hornets nest would you prefer to jostle? The situation is sad all around, and your dad is using you as a tool to twist the knife and keep financial control over your mom. That\u2019s pretty messed up. NTA\n\n*I say vindictive because 17 years is more than enough time to cool down and get a grip on an emotionally charged situation", "This is a whole mess of a situation lol but I had a few questions. Does your mom ask for money? Because if she\u2019s the one paying the rent and since you\u2019re an adult in the home, she can ask you to pay a certain amount as rent for living in her home (I know it\u2019s your dads home but your mom is the one paying rent to live there). If you don\u2019t want to pay anything then you can leave and get your own place, which sounds like the best option in my opinion. \n\nIf you do start paying rent to your mother then you can add a lock to the door to protect your belongings in the room that you pay for. But again, since you\u2019re an adult this is more of a landlord/tenant situation rather than mother/daughter. \n\nUnfortunately you can\u2019t have it both ways: not paying anything for rent on your room, and also demanding your siblings not to enter your room. Your mother is ultimately the owner of the home since she pays and her rules are what goes (until you start paying rent). Her attitude on the other hand is a completely different story.", "ESH\n\nWhile your mother and stepfather are behaving irresponsibly, the position of your financial aid sounds very dubious.  Your father appears to be able to give you plenty of money if he feels like it so this \"on paper he doesn't exist\" sounds very fishy. If the college authorities knew about his income would you actually qualify for that Pell grant?", "ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds fraudulent.", "Nta Why don't you move in with your dad?", "NTA. Your mother created the situation in which she finds herself. You are not responsible for supporting her 6 extra kids, and their entire household would be so much worse off it it weren't for you.

Seriously, she had a generous 18 years to figure her life out, find a career, be with another adult that wasn't irresponsible.

Some of your clues imply dad's \"job\" may not be on the up and up but he's taking care of his kid which I'm not mad about. I would encourage you to start saving for your future tho just in case not on the up and up comes to an end. Good luck.", "Your father is being really unfair here.  He's put you in a position where you will potentially hurt your mother if you decide to go live your own life.  Or, rather, if you decide to go live your own life, then you will feel guilty because he will move to evict her.  \n\nHe needs to be making that decision completely independently of you and your actions, or else you need to tell **both** parents that you are going to move out, and whatever they do going forward is otheir decision, and you will have nothing to do with it.", "Why doesn't he want you to leave? Why is your dad demanding you specify your reasons to leave before you can decide to go? You're an adult. Why can't you just say you want to live independently? Why does he demand to know whether your mom is responsible for your leaving so he can punish her - and therefore make YOU partially responsible for your own mother being punished?

Leave and tell him you want to be independent, no more.", "Isn't it your house that she gets to live in?

I stopped everything when she kept letting my half siblings into my room to use or take my stuff.", "You are solidly NTA.

I don\u2019t think he\u2019d let them live there if I wasn\u2019t there but instead of an eviction if they piss me off, it would probably be something like raising the rent until they\u2019re forced to leave.", "I do have a lock.
