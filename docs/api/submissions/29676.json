I told them once I signed the lease, we had 2 screaming matches, the second time they insisted I had only just told them and the first fight never happened.  Getting out was the best decision I ever made, and you\u2019ll see that too.  By June you\u2019ll have a whole new perspective on yourself, your life, your parents, everything.  You think you know how much they are hurting you now, but once you are free of the daily abuse, oh my goodness you\u2019ll be amazed at the weight lifted off your spirit.  Rescue yourself, free yourself from your abusive parents, trust your instincts.  I know it is scary, and they will get mad and try to stop you, but go.  You are strong and brave and smart and right.  Go!   Be free and happy.  Go!", "I'm not taking the car. I recently found out my car isn't in my name even though my mom told me it was. Likewise, when my extended family took my car away they claimed it was a privilege they gave me.

I will be doing this alone.\n\nI've done the math and I could straight up live on my scholarship money if needed. If I work, I can actually have more in savings going forward compared to slowly depleting my savings account. I can manage on my own.\n\nI have my social security, birth certificate, and recently got my passport. My saving account is strictly in my name, my mom has no access to it nor does she know how much I have saved. She'd be a lot more worried about this being a possibility if I mentioned it. I'll have to switch checking accounts and my credit card though as she has access to that since it's shared. I'm hoping to call the bank later.\n\nI, at the very least, will tell my dad what I'm doing after it's done. He will be the first to know considering he was the one who suggested the locks. He might not like it, but I feel like he wouldn't put up a fuss with me being completely independent as long as I sustain myself. He can be reasoned with. He lives out of the country anyway and we rarely talk, so we are pretty my low contact already even though he's by far my favorite parent.", "This is very good advice.", "I'm over 18, which is what makes this so dangerous. She can kick me out and I wouldn't get any support legally since I'm an adult even though I can't outwardly support myself in my family since they think I'm a baby.\n\nI feel like it's in my own best interest to at least secure a house I know I will always be welcome into before I wake up and find myself homeless.

The only money in my shared one is enough to keep the account from alerting my mom that my balance is too low. Bare minimum.\n\nMy mom will be gone from Christmas til January, so I have weeks to move everything, double check, and then triple check. By the time she's back, I might even have a job since she hated me working. \n\nThe only concern with this plan is if she will travel without me or drag me along since her flight is in the same area as extended family. If she goes alone, I have a month to do whatever I need to and will tell her no straight up to traveling for Christmas like we agreed before. If she's smart enough to drag me along, I'll have to leave in the middle of the night. Much more rushed, but what can I do? I'll just pray she travels without me.", "Oh, yeah, you are way better off without that car and that fight. Go out and make a good life for yourself. Going low or no contact with your mother might be a good thing as well.", "Is the car in your name or your mom's? Because if it's yours, your family can be charged with stealing it. I wish you luck on your quest to escape your evil mother & other family members.", "I didn't catch your age in the your post title; I've edited my feedback.  \n  \nAs an adult, legally she cannot just kick you out.  She has to evict you, which is a process that takes time.  During that time, you can legally stay in the house.  So, if you come home tomorrow and the locks have changed, call the police.  \n  \nThat said, you likely don't *want* to stay in the house.  So, you should use whatever means you can to get out.  That includes securing whatever finances you have available.  If you have a job, make sure the paychecks go to an account that your parents can never touch.  It needs to be an account you opened after you turned 18, at a bank your parents have never used.  Make sure you have your personal papers - your social security card, your birth certificate.  Those belong to you, not them.  Create accounts at the three major credit bureaus and freeze your credit with all of them.  If you have dear belongings and have a trusted friend, maybe start sneaking them out now.  \n  \nThat way, when you are ready to move out, you can grab your remaining stuff and go, and you'll be in a position to land on your feet.  No one should have to do this and I'm sorry you are going through it, but you can do it.  Good luck.", "NTA and seeing all the great advice and plans. Just curious, if she expects you to go with her can your a. find out in advance if the passenger can cancel a flight last minute and/or b. go all the way to the airport with her and then bounce.", "It's in my grandmother's name so I will be leaving it with them. My cousin can have the car, I'll probably leave that in a note.

To my knowledge, I'm not going to be driving her to the airport in the city either.

That's why I hope she isn't planning to have me drive her there.", "Make sure (after all is said and done) that you check in with the police in case mom says that you are missing or in a dangerous situation. \n\nAlso, talk to the university and ensure that are not to give out any information to your family. \n\nMake sure their phone numbers are not on your account or names (only yours). If you can verbally password protect this somehow please do so. \n\nEnsure that your timetable/class schedule is not to be given out to family. \n\nIf you filed taxes or your parents did and the scholarship has any information with their names on it, make sure that the university knows that they have nothing to do with you. We know of other students whose university has given out information to parents before. \n\nGood luck Op! Switch the bank accounts and get a new credit card as close to the date as possible so mom doesn\u2019t realize perhaps\u2026 unless you can get away with it now?", "My mom will 100% do that. She tried to call the cops when I didn't show up from work (back when I had a job) two hours after my shift was over. She essentially started a mass hysteria and the day ended with me getting screamed at.\n\nLeaving a note seems dramatic, but I at least planned to call my dad to tell him exactly what I've done after I did it so at least someone knows I didn't just disappear. My school has an emergency contact listed, but it's not her. I can just change it to my brother since it's required.\n\nI'll be moving with a new class schedule so she won't have access to that. She never bothered to learn the old one anyway. I haven't done taxes at all yet, and my mother doesn't file using my name. We had agreed prior to this that I will be filing my own taxes under my own name as an independent. For financial aid documents, I put my grandmother and I was dubbed independent anyway so that should be easy enough to change. \n\nI feel like the biggest hurdle right now is actually sneaking out. Dreading the phone call to my dad though. My mom is naturally going to explode, so I'll have to be very careful with her. If nothing else, she's going to want to know where I live. Gotta plan how firm I'm going to be right now honestly. \n\nI could probably get away with the credit card. She doesn't check the mail (I do) so she will never see the new card. I could probably get away with a new bank account too, but I'll be doing all that after she travels.", "I'm going to sound harsh, but outside of a written note and/or one replying phone call if or when they call you, why call them? It doesn't sound like they'd provide healthy support to fall back on, and they'll likely guilt you to return once you've left, and not stop calling. At this point I don't think you owe them anything, let alone an explanation.", "I want to call because I'm not cruel. My mom has panicked over less and as much as I'm angry, fed up, and afraid, I don't want to leave knowing my mom is likely having a breakdown because I disappeared. That's a bit too cruel for me. Besides, she will scream longer if she finds out herself.\n\nI'd rather come clean after I move so everyone can be angry and get it over with, rather than disappear and deal with constant phone calls. They don't respect or care about me, better to allow them to let that anger out in the beginning and then forget about me than to play cat and mouse longterm.", "That sounds fair. I suspect that the screaming and constant phone calls won't stop though. They don't respect or care about you, but they definitely care about the control they'll lose. Best to be prepared to change your number and ability to be contacted on the internet.", "Be careful because she can locate you using your phone. If you don't want that you can turn off the location service on your phone, which can help conceal your location.", "NTA --- If she is that controlling and you tell her what your plans are she will probably make sure you can't move out tell her NOTHING continue to make your plans and then just disappear when you have the chance.", "NTA Avoid the confrontation.

Change your phone and number when you do leave, make sure they can't find out your address and absolutely do keep this secret until you're away from them.\n\nGood luck!", "Change your phone number, make sure you have funds in a bank account she doesn't know about, get all your important papers together like birth certificate, social security or similar, passport or driver's license, set up a post office box and be prepared to forward your mail there in the interim.\n\nYou don't trust her, so don't tell her in advance.", "Make sure your bank account is locked down and she has no access to it. Otherwise, she might drain your savings when she finds out you're gone to try and force you back home.", "Take all those documents now and bring them either to a trusted friend (not family) or to a new bank where you open up a safety deposit box.  Don't risk her taking them with her.", "OP, often if you set up a bank account before the age of 18, by law a parent or guardian must be on the account. So make sure that you have a new account in a different bank if that was the case.", "Yes, this was my paranoid thought. If she's that controlling and already knows of plans to move out in the next year, who knows what she might do. Take the documents and put them somewhere safe, preferable not in the house, before she goes", "\"I'm not cruel\" --- *you* aren't but *they* are. I'm so worried for you, bc you are still thinking a little too much about being compassionate & polite of *their* feelings when at this point all you should be worrying about is*your* feelings & safety & security.\n\nYour mother's breakdowns are HER OWN FAULT bc she has never addressed how to manage herself as an adult at best, & more than likely NOT BREAKDOWNS AT ALL, but merely another manipulative tactic to control how you act. (Source: I had an aunt that could be your mother's twin.)\n\nYou don't owe them anything more than a note saying \"I'm legally an adult. I've left. Do not contact me.\"\n\nTake care \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f"]}
