He said he won\u2019t be a slave to capitalism and his parents send him about 1k a month. He also says he has ADHD paralysis and just can\u2019t get a job, or a therapist for that matter.\n\nI pay the rent then I request him on Venmo. At one point he owed me 3 months rent plus other expenses, so I set a boundary for our relationship. I don\u2019t want to be in the position where he owes me money. It makes me uncomfortable, and I feel like I\u2019m being taken advantage of.\n\nYesterday I told him it wasn\u2019t okay that he owed me two thousand dollars because I had set a boundary and he agreed upon it. He absolutely blew up and started getting super upset at me. He told me he couldn\u2019t guarantee any income and that he would never do this to me if I needed it (which felt super emotionally manipulative). We just signed another 13 month lease together, so I started panicking. I\u2019m still pretty nervous about this, and pretty upset.\n\nThe reason I think I could be the asshole is because he says he is actually completely unable to make money, and I have money. \n\nTLDR: he was super upset with me, angry with me, and fighting with me because I asked for the money he owed back. I reinstated my boundary as well that Im not ready and don\u2019t want to be the breadwinner in this relationship which sent him spiraling.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
