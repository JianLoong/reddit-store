You do not need to be a \"wage slave\" do not need to take orders from anyone. And a lot of states will actually pay you money.  But you have to build your own house. Grow your own food.

Saying that not liking capitalism doesn't mean you can avoid living in it, and shifting the responsibility of dealing with all the bills onto your partner based on your politics is an asshole move.  With ADHD I've definately been in situations in my past where I had important things I needed to do to help sort my life out that I couldn't work out how to make a start on, so I do get that, but once again that's not a valid reason to put the entire burden of it on your partner.\n\nThough I think he's 100% in the wrong with this, and doubly so to get angry when it's brought up, I can identify enough with this guy that I wouldn't necessarily jump immediatly to get out as soon as you can like some folks here.  As long as you feel safe I think an attempt at a serious conversation may be worth a try.  I'd make it clear that even if you believe his reasons for being unable to work are true, you aren't happy to carry on supporting the two of you on your own.  I'd make it clear that if the two of you are going to work out he needs at a bare minimum to start the process of getting therapy or medical support to try and be able to manage his ADHD better if he's struggling this much.  I'd also make it clear that he doesn't have to get a perfect job, but he does need to try and get something so he can contribute to the rent/bills, as it's not fair for that to all be on you.  If he is unwilling or unable to hit these minimum levels of effort, he can't be your responsibility to look after, and you should absolutely start looking for an exit.  If he won't try to improve the situation in my opinion it's either just excuses and he's manipulating you, or he had never been in a situation where he needs to take care of himself (which seems fairly likely with his parents sending him an allowance at this stage).  If it's the former you need to get out asap, and if it's the latter he's probably not going to get the motivation to sort himself out anytime soon, as he knows his parents are there as a safety net, so he will lean on you until the financial situation inevitably causes the relationship to break down, at which point he will just continue depending on his parents as long as that angle is available.\n\nThe bad thing is I can genuinely identify with where this guy is coming from, and if I had more wealthy/supportive parents I could imagine possibly having ended up doing this kind of shit by coasting along without ever getting in enough of a crisis to make me get a job at the very least.  If that's what is going on, and a serious talk with you isn't enough to kick him into action, I honestly wouldn't expect things to get better anytime soon unless you get out of that situation.

But the only way your future will change is if you chose to break the cycle.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear what you\u2019ve been through and that you\u2019re currently being taken advantage of. \n\nAs a therapist myself, I urge you to bring up this situation in therapy and ask for help with establishing some new boundaries. The reason I say this is because I think you may have a slight misunderstanding of what a boundary is (do not feel bad about this - many people share this misunderstanding). \n\nA personal boundary is a guideline for how one wishes to react/handle themselves in a given situation. A personal boundary is not meant to change another person\u2019s behaviour because you *cannot* control the actions of other people - only your own. \n\nFor example, I have a boundary with my mother where I will not discuss weight or diet. This doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t allowed to talk about it - after all, I cannot dictate what another person chooses to say. So she still brings it up in conversation fairly often. However, because of my boundary I choose not to engage - I either redirect the conversation or stop talking until the subject is changed.\n\nIn your case, there isn\u2019t much you can do if your partner refuses to pay you back. So a suitable boundary would be that you will not loan him any more money. Not a dime. (This is of course easier said than done, which is why I think it would be helpful to loop in your therapist if you haven\u2019t already). \n\nAnyway, good luck with this. You\u2019re not an asshole for asking to be treated like a partner instead of a piggy bank. Please remember that", ">DTMFA\n\nGet with the landlord, find out what it takes to get out of the lease.\n\nYou should not be with him.

You may even want to consider not being with anyone for a minute until you feel you're worth more than you feel right now (via therapy). I can tell you with some certainty that being alone will feel like a relief, like a load off your shoulders. You'll be lonely sometimes, and you'll go through a lot of batteries (unless you get a rechargeable or a plug-in).

It\u2019s a process and it\u2019s the culmination of small steps. You deserve to be treated as an equal, with respect and with love! I wish you the best because you deserve it.
