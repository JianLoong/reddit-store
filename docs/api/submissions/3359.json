Long story short I had a friend, they're autistic (same as me, we met at a support group). They're nervous and kinda hard to read but they seemed to like and I think they're cool. They've said they need their space time to time so I try my best to respect that. We take different (but somewhat related) majors and they're kinda guarded about their own courses and don't like to mix friends and work, which I get. As friends we were on-and-off but nothing bad much happened until this week.\n\nSo here's the story: my college asks us to sign up for electives for next semester around this time, and we have to pick at least one. There was one I was really interested in, and my friend had already signed up for it. Like I said they don't like to mix friends and work, so I asked them if it'd be a problem for me to sign up to this course too. They told me that it was ultimately up to me, but that it'd make them uncomfortable to 'mix worlds' like that and it'd affect their mental health and ability to concentrate and stuff to have me there too. I told them I understood completely and also told them I'd sign up for a couple other electives I was also interested in, (but not for every course that was available, as some would have been a bad fit for me, or I just didn't think I'd like the material), but if I didn't get in to them then I'd be taking the same elective as they are, since we have to pick at least one, and it would have been the best fit. Left it at that and I thought we'd got an understanding, and they knew I'd be there if I didn't get on to the other courses.\n\nSadly I didn't get on to either of the others. I post about getting on the course and being excited for it on my Facebook and they respond, seeing we're on the same course.\n\nIt turns out they thought our conversation was me promising not to take the same course as them, and they got really mad and told me it was 'really messed up' that I changed my mind about the course without telling them. They pointed out there were other courses I could have signed up for but didn't, and accused me of ignoring their request just cos I wanted to do this specific course. I didn't change my mind is the thing, I did sign up for a couple others but didn't get on to them, and I tried to tell them this and remind them what we'd talked about but they just got madder and madder about it and wouldn't listen, and the whole thing was causing me stress like hell so I blocked them on everything, and sent a last message telling them that I didn't think they were a bad person, but were kind of a bad friend and I didn't want to be friends any more.\n\nI'd leave it at that and stay out of their way in class, but I've had a bunch of messages off of mutual friends and some other mutuals have blocked or unfriended me and people are really mad that I seemingly 'didn't respect their feelings' on this.

The onus for maintaining this boundary for their personal comfort in a public setting *is on them*. \n\n**Also, why can't your autistic friend just say \"I don't like mixing work and friends, do you mind if we sit on opposite sides, never get in a group project for class together, and avoid discussing class when we are hanging out?\"** \n\nIt would be weird as fuck, granted, but much more reasonable an ask than trying to force someone else to alter their educational path (which could ripple into altering their career path) purely because they wanted to avoid mixing work and play. \n\nTruly bizarre.", "NTA\n\nYour former friend needs to learn to deal with these sorts of things. The real world isn't compartmentalized like that. What if they saw one of their teachers at the grocery store? Then what? Would they try to gatekeep grocery shopping?", "No you have not done wrong, it's a great shame they didn't try to work through there difficulties with a therapist instead of ending your friendship, they need to learn in life that they don't get everything their own way, yes they have autism and it makes things very difficult but you tried to come up with a solution, you are taking the same course, just keep your distance and enjoy making new friends.", "NTA - you can pick what courses you want. \n\nTrying not to take the course also wasn\u2019t necessary or fair to you.\n\nBut in regards to your question yes you could\u2019ve done things differently that might\u2019ve led to this situation ending differently although you aren\u2019t an asshole for not. \n\nyou could have told your friend about getting into the course directly rather than letting them find out from your story. It always really sucks to be told upsetting things indirectly. It also would\u2019ve let you suggest ways to manage the situation such as not interacting on class. \n\nBut I think the most impactful thing was that you kept trying to reason with someone who clearly wasn\u2019t in a fit state to be reasoned with, it\u2019s just pushing and pushing on a brick wall when someone is as distressed/out of it as they were (possibly even having a meltdown tbh) the ideal thing you could\u2019ve done above all else was to end the conversation and offer to talk at later date when they were in a calmer state. That could\u2019ve eased off a lot of the stress that caused you to end the friendship because of the situation. I also choose to mention these things despite you not being the asshole in this situation because they\u2019re both things that risk coming up in other friendships too.", "I think even asking if the taking the course was ok went too far. \n\nIt\u2019s college. Unless there\u2019s a restraining order m, you are gonna have to deal if people are in your class.", "i guess that's right. tbh i think they're really used to other people bending for them that they never learned to bend back. they gotta learn somehow and ig it might help down the line. not my cross to carry anymore tho, we're not friends any more", "honestly feels like it. idg what the issue really was. like i empathise with the autism cos i'm also autistic but.... 'huh???' was kinda my response to it until they REALLY started blowing up on me. it caused me such horrible anxiety when they did that and tbh it's the regret from blocking them that i feel most but like, yeah, bad friend.", "Agreed. NTA OP.", "NTA. In the future, your former friend may have friends who join their workplace, coworkers who join personal social groups, and many other instances of merging environments. It is a bit unreasonable to deny you a course of education for this reason, especially given you would work not to interact with them in class.\n\nThey\u2019re allowed to have their feelings but you\u2019re allowed to do what\u2019s best for your education - you even worked to find other options at first. Keep your chin up.", "NTA\n\n> AITA for signing up to a college course against a friend's wishes?\n\n\u2026what\n\nNo, you aren\u2019t the asshole. \n\n> they're kinda guarded about their own courses and don't like to mix friends and work, which I get. \n\nNot to sound too harsh, but too bad. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that anyone here thinks this request is at all appropriate. A \u201cfriend\u201d does not get to block you from taking a class you want to take because they want to keep their worlds separated.\n\nTheir preference here should not dictate your education. Even for an elective.\n\nThey absolutely were being a bad friend. Feelings are not leverage to control your environment and the people in it for something like a college class. You aren\u2019t doing anything TO this person. You aren\u2019t trying to take the course to have access to them for harrassment. You didn\u2019t abuse them, threatening their safety.\n\nIt just happened to be you were both interested in the same class.", "NTA\n\nYour friends are ridiculous and petty.  Whatever course you take is your business, not theirs **at all**.\n\nI don't think it's healthy for you to associate with them.  They don't actually care about you or your future.", "NTA \n\nYou aren't taking the course to spend time with this person, who is NOT your friend, but because the course interests you. There was no need to ask them for \"permission\".\n\nYou seem to know some very immature and unreasonable people from the other responses you've gotten.", "NTA.  having their struggles with it all is fine and valid, but its on them to figure out how to manage that without forcing others to adjust too. unfortunately that just isnt how the real world works, and that'll never work in any job or future setting where it could be an issue again.  i hope both of you are able to actually enjoy the class and make it through with minimal issues.", "It's really nice that you are being considerate of your friend, but they don't run your life and if that's all that you got into, tough luck for your friend. They have to learn to make adjustments too, even if they are autistic. NTA.", "NTA as everyone is saying, but i want to point out that you shouldn\u2019t have asked them if it was okay if you took the same class because it\u2019s not their choice to decide", "NTA\n\nYour friend is insane, friends don't get to choose your college courses.", ">Like I said they don't like to mix friends and work, so I asked them if it'd be a problem for me to sign up to this course too.\n\nOther people's problems are not the center of your life. You should never ask your friends' input on your course selection like that-- don't be a doormat, your friend's comfort with your course selection should not be a factor in what course you pick. Upfront, you should have selected the course and told them \"I don't expect you to interact with me in class, or discuss class with me, we can sit apart and ignore each other if that makes it better for you,\" or something when they expressed issue.\n\nYTA TO YOURSELF for opening it up to debate in the first place. (NTA in general).", "NTA your friend can not choose your future career path! Only you can choose what your future holds and if that upsets them, too bad, they have to get over it.", "NTA. But your \"friend\" certainly is. I'm autistic. But that doesn't give me an excuse to act like an AH. Your friend can't control your life, and the fact that they are being bitter about it and turning people against you is super horrible.", "WTAF did I just read.  College courses are something YOU a person spend YOUR money to take to pursue YOUR future.  Unless you have a legal restraining order against someone in the class, you have every right to take any class you want in any timeslot you want.  \n\nI'm not I guess autistic enough to understand this idea that someone else's very presence in the lecture hall is going to cause me mental health trauma.  I'd honestly expect to be more activated by all the strange different people.  Is this a thing?  \n\nPerhaps your ex friend really needs to visit Disability Services at your school for some tools for the classroom.  You are absolutely NTA", "NTA. I don't get the way of thinking behind \"not mixing friends and work\" if it's about a course. That's utter rubbish.", "NTA. \n\nIf they\u2019re worried you\u2019ll goof off in class and distract them, then don\u2019t sit together? If they\u2019re worried you\u2019ll mooch off their notes and work, they can set a firm boundary? They can\u2019t control if other people take the same classes as them or work at the same company - they need to figure out how to deal with it.", "My first thought was, what if the other person had said that yes, it absolutely would be a problem for you to be on that course as well? Would you still have applied for it? Now don't get me wrong, OP had every right to attend whatever course they want, but by asking the other person that, it may have made it seem like they wouldn't attend if there was an issue. Granted, OP did explain they would choose that course if they didn't get any of the others, but the \"friend\" clearly either missed or misunderstood that. \nIt might have been better if OP had reached out privately and explained that they would be on that course before the other person found out, but hindsight is 20/20. Either way, it's done now and the only thing to do is move on!", "NTA. That's an issue for them to deal with. You shouldn't be letting your life be affected by other people's issues, lord knows each of us all have enough issues of our own already.\n\nAlso, this:\n\n>but I've had a bunch of messages off of mutual friends and some other mutuals have blocked or unfriended me and people are really mad that I seemingly 'didn't respect their feelings' on this. \n\nis all hella toxic. I'd find a better group of friends because none of these are your friends.", "NTA but wtf are your friends 5yo", "Sorted then!", "Assign seating... in university?", "That's their problem. And to be blunt, if having someone they know there will be enough to distract them to that point, they're going to be distracted by a dozen other things as well and they wouldn't have ever passed the course.", "Give them space by sitting across the room from dealing. Dealing with former friends and exes is part of college life.", "NTA. You have no obligation to anybody\u2019s education but yours", "What?? Does this person OWN the course? smh You can take any course you want. This person is not your friend. NTA", "NTA.  enjoy the course you picked.", "NTA. Honestly, you should have never run it by this person in the first place. This is your college and your future career at stake\u2014no so-called friend gets a say in it.", "NTA, you 2 aren't friends any more so no more \"mixed worlds\" so not sure why anyone continues to have an issue. Also this person has no friends that share in their major? Regardless you don't owe them anything and honestly you shouldn't have even done them the courtesy of the ask as this gave them the impression they could tell you what to do.", "NTA I don't care if my 'friend' doesn't me to be in the same class as him/her just because it would be a problem for him/her. Besides, I'm paying for the course not the 'friend'. \n\nAutistic or not that was very rude of them to tell you which courses you should take and which not. And it was stupid of you that you even asked them. \n\nYou usually ask your friends if they are getting the same courses as you because you will have company and someone to talk to in case of an emergency or even if you need help. That's what college students do. I have an friend who is autistic. We're not in the same department but we met during the general courses. He never asked me to not take the same course as him. It would have been incredibly rude of him and I would get angry with him. We help each other that's what friends are for. There were times where he needed my help and I needed his. \n\nYou need to find new friends.", "NTA - you tried to find another class and couldn\u2019t and they don\u2019t get to decide what classes you take in college - just enjoy your class and ignore them and let other know that you and this person talked about it this way and you followed your word and took the class when you couldn\u2019t take others and to get the hell off their d*mn high horses", "NTA. It isn't your problem, that they on the spectrum or not, cannot handle having someone they know in the same class as them. How hard is it to ignore someone til the class is over? They do not own the class or the right to tell you what to or not to take.", "Definetly NTA, they don't own the rights to certain classes and it's not fair that they would get to choose what classes they want to take and not let you take what classes you want to take. That's not a friend.", "Nta. Generally friends prefer to take classes with their friends so that they\u2019ve got someone to sit with and someone to study the content with. This girl isn\u2019t your friend", "Nta. You are paying for this degree. They don't get to dictate what classes you take let alone if they prefer you in or out of any courses. Don't ever feel obligated to ask anyone about your courses with them ever again. \n\nThose are not your friends keep a distance from them going forward.", "just because they have autism doesn't mean that they can dictate your class schedule or what you do anywhere. this individual is not your friend and not supportive of you at all. they can't keep school and friends separate, classes with overlap, and it's crazy to try that. you did nothing wrong. They are in the wrong. \n\nnta. \nthey are not your friend and just ignore them", "They can't mix friends and college if you aren't friends anymore lol\n\n\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA.  That's how registering for classes goes, and your ex-friend should understand that.", "They also sound unhinged. I go to a 40,000 person school and have so many of the same people in my classes because of similar majors. It\u2019s just something they\u2019ll have to deal with at some point.", "Exactly! Universities, not students, are responsible for providing reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities, mental health issues, etc. This person's request of OP is not reasonable by any stretch of the imagination. If they're that concerned about their ability to concentrate, they need to speak to the school about it, not OP.", "That\u2019s definitely an issue I\u2019ve had with people who have autism about how all decisions are based on how they feel an they are never able to compromise.", "YTA to YOURSELF. Why did you even freaken ask them for permission?

I think not.\nThat being said, perhaps you should avoid all contact with them in class , & maybe outside of class for a while too.\nCooling off period, hopefully they will miss you and forgive and forget. If not, we\u2019ll maybe they were never true friends.\nA true friend will take the bullet for you, will sacrifice their best interest for yours, an associate is a person you hang out with, you socialize with , but does not have your best interest in mind.

They don\u2019t get to decide who does or doesn\u2019t take courses.", "NTA He has no right to dictate what classes you can take. I wouldn't interact with him in this class. Maybe you will lose a friend over this, or maybe the friendship can lay dormant during this semester.\n\nHe is being unreasonable and I understand that this is part of diagnosis. Sometimes it is impossible to accommodate them every time. Now he can decide how he wants to  go forward. Sometimes the friends you lose aren't worth the trouble of keeping.", "This person is not your friend", "NTA. Your friends need to realize they\u2019re in the real world now.

Making up lies. because there's absolutely no reason for anyone to be upset with you and no reason for people to unfriend/block you.", "NTA if they dont want to \"mix worlds\" then they can do a different course not you.
