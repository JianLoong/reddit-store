Long story short I had a friend, they're autistic (same as me, we met at a support group). They're nervous and kinda hard to read but they seemed to like and I think they're cool. They've said they need their space time to time so I try my best to respect that. We take different (but somewhat related) majors and they're kinda guarded about their own courses and don't like to mix friends and work, which I get. As friends we were on-and-off but nothing bad much happened until this week.\n\nSo here's the story: my college asks us to sign up for electives for next semester around this time, and we have to pick at least one. There was one I was really interested in, and my friend had already signed up for it. Like I said they don't like to mix friends and work, so I asked them if it'd be a problem for me to sign up to this course too. They told me that it was ultimately up to me, but that it'd make them uncomfortable to 'mix worlds' like that and it'd affect their mental health and ability to concentrate and stuff to have me there too. I told them I understood completely and also told them I'd sign up for a couple other electives I was also interested in, (but not for every course that was available, as some would have been a bad fit for me, or I just didn't think I'd like the material), but if I didn't get in to them then I'd be taking the same elective as they are, since we have to pick at least one, and it would have been the best fit. Left it at that and I thought we'd got an understanding, and they knew I'd be there if I didn't get on to the other courses.\n\nSadly I didn't get on to either of the others. I post about getting on the course and being excited for it on my Facebook and they respond, seeing we're on the same course.\n\nIt turns out they thought our conversation was me promising not to take the same course as them, and they got really mad and told me it was 'really messed up' that I changed my mind about the course without telling them. They pointed out there were other courses I could have signed up for but didn't, and accused me of ignoring their request just cos I wanted to do this specific course. I didn't change my mind is the thing, I did sign up for a couple others but didn't get on to them, and I tried to tell them this and remind them what we'd talked about but they just got madder and madder about it and wouldn't listen, and the whole thing was causing me stress like hell so I blocked them on everything, and sent a last message telling them that I didn't think they were a bad person, but were kind of a bad friend and I didn't want to be friends any more.\n\nI'd leave it at that and stay out of their way in class, but I've had a bunch of messages off of mutual friends and some other mutuals have blocked or unfriended me and people are really mad that I seemingly 'didn't respect their feelings' on this. IDK if I did anything wrong or could have done anything different so....

I signed up to a couple others so if I got accepted onto one of those instead I could take a different one and spare them the discomfort.\n\nI didn't get accepted onto the other courses I wanted, and so I ended up taking the same course as them, which they're mad about. I blocked them and I feel like I may have been an asshole for signing up in the first place even though they didn't want me to, and then blocking them when they got angry.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm an educator, and I'd be horrified, and probably reporting it, if I thought one of my students was putting pressure on another student not to select a particular module because they didn't want to be in the same class.

Getting stressed by this isn\u2019t the part that makes them the asshole; it\u2019s that the option of them not taking the elective so that you could take it was never put on the table or discussed.

Your education, your choice of courses. Tough luck that your (ex)friend has to \"mix worlds\" and see you in class. That's life. What's going to happen once they have a job? Are they going to tell all their co-workers \"hey, I don't mix worlds, and I'm going to \\[restaurant\\], so don't go there because I'm going to be there.\"?  They're going to be the laughing stock of the office, and everyone is going to completely ignore them, both on and off the clock. Drop this friend as no true friend would treat you this way. If your mutual friends decide to side with them, then they weren't exactly friends to begin with either. My recommendation is that you let all the mutual friends that haven't blocked you know your side of the story, then they can decide if they want to continue to agree with and support your ex-friend or agree with you. They can also let the rest of the group that had already blocked you know your side.

You are responsible for your own triggers and mental health. On the bright side, it shouldn't be an issue of mixing friends and school (which, wouldnt you want the support? Idk, to each their own) as you are no longer friends. They have nothing to complain about anymore there", "That's a them problem that they should work on with a professional. Demanding someone not take a course they're interested in is not only unreasonable but absolute insanity to even consider.\n\nLive your life, OP.", "It doesn't matter what the reasoning is, that is an internal issue for them.\n\nHonestly what you're describing is that this person didn't like you and didn't have the courage to dump you out of the friend group when you broke up and so is finally doing it. If your presence is so distracting their whole life would collapse by you being present in a classroom, it's them saying that you are a person who was not welcome in their life", "this is probably right. if that is what it is wish they'd told me earlier. it's been years."]}
