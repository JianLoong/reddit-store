I'm going to give your hosts the benefit of the doubt, and assume the no-swimsuit  rule is in place to keep the water as clean as possible, and reduce the amount of time/effort/supplies needed to achieve that.  But even if the rule was arbitrary, you should still follow it.\n\nHOWEVER, they are not being good hosts.  Not because of the rule, but because they refuse to do you the simple courtesy of giving you a heads up when they want to use the hot tub, which would allow you to time your hot tub use to avoid them seeing you nude/you seeing them nude.  Good hosts should want their guests to fully enjoy their stay (including their nice hot tub!), and above all, feel welcome and comfortable.  \n\nGiving you some warning is not a lot to ask, since you're only staying for a week.

For instance if your suit has any sort of detergents or oil it can leach into the hot tub, then the hot tub would require some maintenance.

And, even if you shower beforehand, you are still going to soak off a whole bunch of dead skin cells in the hot tub that wouldn\u2019t come off with a 10 minutes shower and it certainly wouldn\u2019t stop whatever ordinary bodily fluids that constantly exude from one\u2019s body (sweat, for example).\n\n\nSounds much more like a legal disclaimer from the hot tub company than anything else.\n\n\nWith that said, OP, YTA, you gotta follow the rules of the house, which given your current privacy needs means no more hot tubbing for you.

What about jumping in a pool with all your outside clothes, including your shoes? Most people would call that unacceptable. They're different norms. If you had a spa, they wouldn't insist on being naked in it if you didn't want them to, I hope.\n\nThere might be practical reasons for it, but I'm guessing the main one is that they want their spa area to be a place where they can feel free of what they consider prudish norms of your society.

But if you want to use it, just follow the house rules.\n\nYTA", "I go to saunas very often and you have signs everywhere that the bathing suit is forbidden. You can cover yourself but wearing a piece of plastic in a sauna is disgusting.", "Good for you. Yeah, the only thing you should demand is people clean up after themselves and not to trash your place.", "There are dozens of us.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from. Just wanted to explain that I know someone from Scandinavia and they are very religious about the rule about nudity in spas.\n\nIt\u2019s insanely rude to try to insist on nudity when their is a cultural difference - especially as 1. They\u2019re not in Europe and 2. It sounds like they\u2019re not European?\n\nIMO they\u2019re just being bad hosts.", "I came here to say that too!", "Uh\u2026it\u2019s THEIR house? What kind of guest thinks they have the right to demand exclusive use of anything except the room they\u2019re staying in?", "Depends. In Finland public pools for example rarely let people use swimwear on sauna. But that is in places where there is risk (tho I did visit spa that had sauna's around pools and there wasnt rule like that)\n\nIssue with that is chlorine from pool. When there is tons of people during day they don\u2019t want people breathe in all that chlorine. \n\nOP is still NTA and this comes from finnish person who has grown up around sauna culture. I understand no bathing suit in sauna rule from health reason in public pools. And even then you can always use towel. \n\nYou are still allowed to wear towels", "This is super normal in Scandinavia, the naked in the sauna requirement is actually a hygiene thing. But pushing OP to be naked together is definitely not ok.", "Well, for Spanish, french, and swiss it can be a problem in some cases, and it's the case here for the OP. It's ok to be wellnesses, but what is more ok is to be free to make what you're comfortable with. Your body your choice.", "Thanks koala, that's a nuance i hadn't heard", "That doesn't change the fact that it has hygienic (and thus maintenance) consequences. That the hosts don't want those consequences is justified.", "ofc they are hurting the owners? This rule isn't just for fun, wtf. it's a legit health risk wearing clothes to a spa. It increases the maintenance extensively, and if the owners  do not want to deal with that in their own home, its incredibly rude to ignore them, just because of prudish vanity reasons. Just don't use the spa then.", "RIGHT! My first thought as well", "Why is it up to the host to explain while OP didn't ask and just assumed it was a joke and could be ignored? Do you expect every hotel to explain at length why you cannot smoke in their rooms?\n\nWhat I wrote is well known and quite common sense. Why do you have to skewed expectation that everything falls on the host, rather than OP just simply following the rules of the place they are staying OR ASK why the rules are there?", "They have rules which are pretty clear (and rely on well known stuff), OP didn't asked for the reason why just ignored the rules and assumed they had 'jokingly' put common sense signs up. It is not up to the host to at length explain their rules for something OP doesn't have to use. Quite weird that you think hotels should explain their rules, like not smoking in the room, at length (why you cannot and stuff). While it is quite obvious you shouldn't do it?", "Why are their rules demented? This is a common requirement in many European countries for hygiene purposes. \n\nWhen I go to sauna the chemicals used in the pool are far less abrasive. It\u2019s important that all guests shower before use and do not wear swimsuits in the water as they collect and store bacteria.\n\nI would absolutely be kicked out of the saunas I go to if I\u2019d worn a bathing suit in any of the areas (pool/hot tub, sauna, hammam room, etc)\n\nEven in OPs example, they didn\u2019t wash the swimsuit fully after use. Rinsing it and leaving it out to dry is the clear reason why OPs hosts don\u2019t want OP to wear it in the tub or sauna.", "Yeah I guess it\u2019s sort of an ESH situation. My point was mostly that \u201chouse rules\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically give hosts a pass-house rules can be assholey, and in this case I think they are. But I agree that at this point the right call is just not use the hot tub.", "It's not about the material or hygiene, it's about the fact your swimsuit will have chlorine residue in it from the pool, and that's toxic when it evaporates in the sauna. That's why a towel is ok and a swimsuit isn't.", "What kind of bathing suits are you wearing that are made of plastic?", "Yeah towels were all good, except in the water obviously. It was pretty damn cool actually. Think it cost like 20 euro (back in 2006) to get in though.", "When it come to saunas, it's a matter of safety. Evaporating chlorine from swimsuits is literally toxic. It's not a culture matter, just a matter of people from non-sauna cultures not actually understanding the reasoning which has nothing to do with preferences, but is there to keep you all from collapsing and dying in the sauna.\n\nIf you want to cover yourself, use a clean towel.", "Uh\u2026it\u2019s OP\u2019s body? What kind of host thinks they have the right to demand nudity in a common use space?", "Oh goodness, not just Switzerland but APPENZELL! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "> It must have been a nudism lake.\n\nI agree with you that most don't swim/sunbathe naked, but wtf is a nudism lake? \n\nPretty sure in Germany it perceived as casual enough that you can find people skinny dipping / sunbathing near most bodies of water (i.e. the River in Nuremberg/Munich). Doesn't have to be specifically designated like you may see in other places.", "Fellow Eastern European here, they don\u2019t allow you to be naked in this part of Europe, but they provide sauna towels to cover yourself because generally it\u2019s frowned upon to wear swimsuits in there.\n\nIn bathtubs though you are expected to wear something, no one uses it naked", "EU is a political and economic union - why would you say EU when describing a geographic region.  You end up excluding Switzerland, Iceland, UK and Norway plus a host of other countries.  Especially since out of that group of countries Norwegians dont wear swimsuits in spa's.", "Because your swimsuit absorbs it more into the fibers than the surface of your skin does", "I apologise for my cultural ignorance. I should not have used such language.", "Why do the hosts suck? It\u2019s most likely that the cleaning regimen and pool chemicals are not hygienic for use with a bathing suit. Lower levels of chemicals and non abrasive cleaning is common for saunas that require nudity and showering before use.\n\nSwim suits just collect and store bacteria.\n\nEven in OPs example, they didn\u2019t wash the swimsuit fully after use. Rinsing it and leaving it out to dry is the clear reason why OPs hosts don\u2019t want OP to wear it in the tub or sauna.", "UK English, move out, is perfectly acceptable. When I am on holiday, I move out of the hotel room to go home.", "Please consider a towel/robe next time, if your swimwear has any chlorine residue from swimming pool etc, it evaporates into a toxic gas in sauna.", "Not in Dutch spas. You're naked and a bathrobe is required in restaurants. You're required to be naked in hot tubs, salt water baths, the swimming pool etc. They have special swimwear days/ nights where the opposite applies.", "A lot of bathing suits have little metal or plastic details on them (shoulder strap hooks, decorative details etc) which will get really hot in a sauna (we are talking about 100\u00b0C / 212\u00b0F) and will burn the person. It's much easier to ask everyone to remove the swimwear before sauna than to deal with customer complaints later about getting burnt.", "It's that SNL skit with Drew Barrymore in the hot tub saying \"my lovaaah\" in my head.", "Bow-chicka-bow-wow", "Then they should say 'use a towel or wear thin, clean clothing,' not, \"get naked in my house or else.\"\n\nThey can't be so obtuse as to not understand how that would come across- these aren't people from a sauna culture after all, they've just spent a lot of time there.", "But he was using the hottub.", "Evaporating chlorine from swimsuits is different than evaporating chlorine from the spa itself? What about evaporating chlorine from towels? OP specifically said she wore a suit in the spa, not the sauna where the fumes concentrate.", "One that understands that wearing a swimsuit especially to a sauna is a health hazard, as evaporating chlorine is toxic, and swimsuits tend to drag in stuff to hot tubs that mess with the water and make you do a lot more maintenance. If she's not ok with it, she can also just...not go? Or find another solution like a clean towel to cover herself with.", "They don\u2019t. I never said that. What I said is OP can\u2019t demand exclusive use of the hot tub, and the hosts wanting to join OP is well within their right as the owners of the home.", "Did you actually see one of the top comments claims there is no health or maintenance reason for this rule? Yes there is, there absolutely is. Yet if you point that out you can expect downvotes because apparently it is all to the host to explain that. All hotels are thus at fault, because in every hotel I stayed so far you are not allowed to smoke in the room. Yet no hotel has ever explained to me why not. ... people are weird...", "Americans are so prudish it's astonishing.", "Most are made of nylon, or polyester -- both of which are plastic fabrics.", "It doesn\u2019t seem as though they offered a towel as a compromise. Simply demanded nudity.", "She said she doesn't mind if they're naked and use the hot tub at the same time as her as long as she doesn't also have to be naked. That's not demanding sole use. She said she would go naked if they agreed not to pop in on her. You're reading things really wrong lol"]}
