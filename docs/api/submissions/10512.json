I'm going to give your hosts the benefit of the doubt, and assume the no-swimsuit  rule is in place to keep the water as clean as possible, and reduce the amount of time/effort/supplies needed to achieve that.  But even if the rule was arbitrary, you should still follow it.\n\nHOWEVER, they are not being good hosts.  Not because of the rule, but because they refuse to do you the simple courtesy of giving you a heads up when they want to use the hot tub, which would allow you to time your hot tub use to avoid them seeing you nude/you seeing them nude.  Good hosts should want their guests to fully enjoy their stay (including their nice hot tub!), and above all, feel welcome and comfortable.  \n\nGiving you some warning is not a lot to ask, since you're only staying for a week.

For instance if your suit has any sort of detergents or oil it can leach into the hot tub, then the hot tub would require some maintenance.

What about jumping in a pool with all your outside clothes, including your shoes? Most people would call that unacceptable. They're different norms. If you had a spa, they wouldn't insist on being naked in it if you didn't want them to, I hope.\n\nThere might be practical reasons for it, but I'm guessing the main one is that they want their spa area to be a place where they can feel free of what they consider prudish norms of your society.

I've been in saunas where nudity was allowed and where nudity wasn't and all forbade swimsuits / had rules on what types of clothing were allowed   \n\nbut towels or clean cotton clothes are totally fine, and some western saunas will not allow nudity. almost all of the bathhouses I've been to (that all require nudity in other areas) will provide guests with loose cotton tops and bottoms that you can wear in the sauna. they all also obviously provide towels. I've never once seen a sauna require nudity\n\nalso if their hot tub isn't chlorinated, swimsuits are a much bigger issue. in my personal experience hot tubs that aren't chlorinated have ALL forbidden suits for hygiene issues. and they've all been *super* strict about showering naked before entering the tubs every single time. if you get out of the pool and go into any other room, you must shower before getting back in. not just after getting in the sauna or a steam room or working out or anything that makes you sweaty, but also after going in an ice room, or a TV room, or a room where you can nap, or getting any type of treatment. even if you only leave and walk 30 feet away to grab something from the locker room, they will make you shower before you get back in. if you're going between different pools with different water treatments, you're also usually required to rinse between changing pools   \n\nso yes, there are hygiene issues with wearing swimsuits in saunas and hot tubs. however saunas have very easy alternatives to swimsuits. and even with hot tubs there seem to be compromises like a special dedicated suit that's taken care of properly. but also, if this was a hygiene concern, they would have said so. they wouldn't have gone on about etiquette. and OP tried to negotiate and said they were willing to go nude if they would be allowed privacy. and they absolutely refused   \n\nso definitely NTA. what OP did wasn't exactly hygienic but they had absolutely no way of knowing that. they've probably only ever experienced hot tubs that are heavily chlorinated and require suits. and a cutesy etiquette sign communicates nothing about why you shouldn't do this. and this clearly wasn't an issue with the hot tub owners for hygiene reasons. and the hot tub owners are being total fucking creeps", "i agree. idk why you\u2019re being downvoted. op\u2019s friends are fucking weirdos.", "Let me solve it- it\u2019s not true.
