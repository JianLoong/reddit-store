I'm going to give your hosts the benefit of the doubt, and assume the no-swimsuit  rule is in place to keep the water as clean as possible, and reduce the amount of time/effort/supplies needed to achieve that.  But even if the rule was arbitrary, you should still follow it.\n\nHOWEVER, they are not being good hosts.  Not because of the rule, but because they refuse to do you the simple courtesy of giving you a heads up when they want to use the hot tub, which would allow you to time your hot tub use to avoid them seeing you nude/you seeing them nude.  Good hosts should want their guests to fully enjoy their stay (including their nice hot tub!), and above all, feel welcome and comfortable.  \n\nGiving you some warning is not a lot to ask, since you're only staying for a week.

For instance if your suit has any sort of detergents or oil it can leach into the hot tub, then the hot tub would require some maintenance.

And, even if you shower beforehand, you are still going to soak off a whole bunch of dead skin cells in the hot tub that wouldn\u2019t come off with a 10 minutes shower and it certainly wouldn\u2019t stop whatever ordinary bodily fluids that constantly exude from one\u2019s body (sweat, for example).\n\n\nSounds much more like a legal disclaimer from the hot tub company than anything else.\n\n\nWith that said, OP, YTA, you gotta follow the rules of the house, which given your current privacy needs means no more hot tubbing for you.

What about jumping in a pool with all your outside clothes, including your shoes? Most people would call that unacceptable. They're different norms. If you had a spa, they wouldn't insist on being naked in it if you didn't want them to, I hope.\n\nThere might be practical reasons for it, but I'm guessing the main one is that they want their spa area to be a place where they can feel free of what they consider prudish norms of your society.
