You could have just said I ran across a dress and restructured it myself as sewing and redesign is one of my passions.  There was no need to state it was from goodwill or even that it was used clothing.  I buy used clothing too, so I am not against it at all.  I get that you are proud of what you do and you obviously have skills as I have made clothes and it isn\u2019t that easy especially when handling shiny fabrics. I also get that you are not into consumerism.   The thing is, not everyone is comfortable with used clothing and you pointing out your disdain for purchasing products off the rack could be insulting to your bf\u2019s bosses.

I also thrift shop for almost all of my clothes (I don't have the skill to tailor mine - that's amazing and I would *also* have stood chatting with you and asking questions about that, for the record), and I can tell you I see wealthy people who go thrift shopping all the time. Your boyfriend might be anxious and insecure about his \"image\" but a lot of wealthy people are not - they love a bargain too! \n\nYeah, there might be a few people (like your BF) who think \"expensive = better\" but the vast majority will just be impressed and think that you are talented/clever. And I believe you said that you mentioned your thoughts about the quality of the clothing you choose and iasues of sustainability when you were at the party, which I think would make it clear that you aren't thrift shopping out of financial necessity. (There wouldn't be anything wrong with it if you *were* thrifting out of financial necessity, but I can at least see where advertising that fact might be uncomfortable cocktail conversation - it's just fairly clear that's not what you were doing).\n\nYour BF needs to chill out and reassess his priorities.

Even children recognize the absolutely necessity of pockets.", "Saying that you salvage cloth to tailor your own clothes is like saying that you bought a fixer-upper so that you can totally design it how you want it.

It broke down within 6 months, which pissed me off. I could have gotten it fixed, but I remembered that my mother was still using her mother's old Featherweight (from the 1950s) and it was still running like a charm, so instead I just pitched the new one, then hopped on Craigslist and started searching. I managed to find a 306K swing-needle (1954, with all its cams and the original manual). Then I bought two more from antique malls \u2013 one for just $25 (I don't remember the model or age, and I've loaned it to a friend, so I can't check), and a 99-13 (1931, with a knee bar feed). My parents found a 1914 machine in their basement (it belonged to the former owner of their house), and my aunt gave me my paternal grandmother\u2019s 127 treadle (1928) that had been sitting in a barn, and then a garage, since at least the late 1960s. The guy who helps my mother in the yard gave me one of his mother's old machines \u2013 she was a seamstress, and his father was a Singer salesman \u2013 a model 201K, but I don't remember how old that one is either. And another aunt stumbled upon a Featherweight 221-1 (1946), snapped it up, and gave it to me for Xmas one year.

He got every one of my machines cleaned up and running smoothly. Sadly, he had a heart attack during the lockdown and had to move in with his son, but he was able to refer me to a (comparatively) younger man and his son who learned from him how to maintain the old machines. \n\nI've also got a serger, which is not a vintage machine.\n\nAnd THEN I discovered rotary irons.
