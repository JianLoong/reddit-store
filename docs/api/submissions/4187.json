You do need to be aware that at work events, you are partially what your bf is being judged on.  You could have just said I ran across a dress and restructured it myself as sewing and redesign is one of my passions.  There was no need to state it was from goodwill or even that it was used clothing.  I buy used clothing too, so I am not against it at all.  I get that you are proud of what you do and you obviously have skills as I have made clothes and it isn\u2019t that easy especially when handling shiny fabrics. I also get that you are not into consumerism.   The thing is, not everyone is comfortable with used clothing and you pointing out your disdain for purchasing products off the rack could be insulting to your bf\u2019s bosses.  Also plenty of mass produced clothing is made with decent fabrics, it just costs more, so that could be taken as a dog to anyone there that their clothes were not that great.", "NTA \n\nWay to go!!

NTA\n2. Turn this into a side business and you\u2019ll be rolling in cash! I could imagine how some of your husband\u2019s coworker\u2019s wives would love for you to spruce up or tailor some of their old clothes to be on trend! Having a talent for tailoring, especially at your level, is rare!", "Ok your boyfriend is an ass. Basically you are creating couture pieces. That takes amazing skill and talent! I am not good with clothes but I am a preservationist and antique dealer. I have pulled dozens of pieces of furniture out of the trash and restored them and made an excellent profit as well. BRAVO!", "Your boyfriend is a snob , more interested in keeping an image of having money,  for him good will is below status .Seriously vain of him .You are amazing, if I had the skills I would be doing the same.", "NTA.

Because that's the impression I'm getting.\n\nAs you almost definitely know, upcycling thrifted clothes is very \"in\", and if you do it impressively enough, your outfits will cause a positive buzz, not cackling around the water cooler. I'm sure you dress very stylishly.\n\nTell your boyfriend to take his bike trailer full of ridiculous status anxiety and park it elsewhere.", "NtA but your partner is. I am a seamstress I wish my husband would get bent out of shape this way. Good grief you could make money hand over fist doing that with the right crowds, those women pay BANK for their clothes to be custom to them.

I wish I had your abilities", "NTA but your bf is.", "INFO Is he upset because he feels you bragged about the low cost or because you bought it used? Or does he feel you bragged about your skills? I\u2019m seriously trying understand why his non-tailored panties are in a twist.", "I sew all the clothes I wear and if I get compliments, I tell people I made them and yes, you can save quite a bit of money that way.

Would you like to see the before pictures?\"\n\nLeave out Goodwill, leave out cost.\n\nFor a lot of people, there is social cach\u00e9 to being wasteful, and you may in fact be damaging his image by failing to participate in waste culture.", "Yes! When women say things like \"thanks, I got it for $2 on clearance at Target\", we're not downplaying the compliment, we're showing off our skills! It's a form of bragging that is socially acceptable because we're also exchanging valuable information.  \n\nBeing asked for the designer and having to answer that you *made that dress yourself* from a thrift-store find is like, say, a hunter reluctantly admitting, only when asked, that he killed that 14-point buck with a rubber-band slingshot. \n\n...I don't know, maybe ridiculously rich people don't do this.

I mean, that's a conversation i would be deeply interested, along with knowing if you do custom orders/alterations! I love thrifting but i suck at sewing", "NTA\n\nYes! She had a bonding moment with the other SO.\n\n\nI disagree with OP however on how much the dress cost, she's completely disregarding work/time value as an added cost because she invested in the tools and know how, and obviously didn't pay for the work.\n\n\nThat DID go into the outfit's value. The 10/20 dollars is just what the materials cost.", "I really like your post.  I was thinking \"hmmm... BF could just choose to be proud of OP and join her in talking about sustainability and the art of tailoring, but no, he had to go low and scold her for being embarrassing.

I would love to see.", "Honestly OP is indeed the asshole for telling us all about this wonderful dress and then not showing us the pictures.", "if i had met OP at a fancy work party in a beautiful outfit she hand tailored HERSELF??? i would have literally not shut the fuck up to my partner on the way home about how cool and talented she is. \n\ndon\u2019t let your boyfriend dampen your spark OP, you have actual SKILLS that most people would kill for.", "I think that if I was at that party & met OP I would be raving about the awesome person I met and hoping that I would get to learn from her", "I worked with a woman like that! Real fashion plate, had a side line as a professional shopper for women's fashion, and 100% of her wardrobe was thrifted.  She was awesome.", "NTA. Anyway. The dress wasn\u2019t really cheap when you consider a) the time that went into altering it and more importantly b) the time that went into becoming skilled at tailoring clothes. \n\nNot everyone could do what OP did. I\u2019d like to, but I don\u2019t have the skill and I suspect it would take many years of learning to get any good at it. So really, OP was talking about her craft. Which is really incredibly cool and which her BF clearly has little regard for. \n\nUgh. It makes me not like him very much.", "I think he got insecure that she took all the spotlight so instead of being proud of her, he got angry and created an excuse to justify his anger.", "I found a designer purse at the Goodwill once that looked brand new. Got it for $10. Still have it several years later.", "Oh boy, if someone told me that my job was to smile and nod and make them look good, I would find it was suddenly my job to stay home in my pjs not caring about them.", "I got married 20 years ago and my husband could never understand the whole \u201cOMG IT HAS POCKETS!!\u201d squee-fest my friends had over my custom cocktail/wedding dress.

Buy your shoes second hand.  Consignment or thrift shops.  Designer brands.  1/10 of the price.  Already broken in.  All the gain without the pain.  My $20 Michael Kors heels are the crown jewel in my thrift store collection.", "i'm afraid this reveals something bigger : OP and her boyfriend have opposite cultures. He's in corporate bling and wants a trophy wife whose look shouts 'money' while OP is an artist with sustainability oriented values. What the hell are you doing together ?", "I sew as a hobby. I would cheerfully spend the entire evening chatting with OP about tailoring techniques. Anyone who looks down on her for finding the clothing at Goodwill is a rich snob and not worth wasting your time on.", "Very much reminds me of the 80's movie Pretty In Pink!  Being able to tailor clothing is an art form!  I would love to have that skill.", "My niece was trying on bridesmaids dresses and after trying on a dozen or so she finally found one she liked, but said \u201cI just wish it had pockets!\u201d She then patted her hips and, lo and behold, there were pockets!  I told her \u201cquick, wish for a million dollars,\u201d but whatever the magic was, it only worked once.", "It's a conspiracy. We're all in on it. We're hoping that if we repeat this often enough, clothing manufacturers will make pockets standard. Flat-out asking them to do that hasn't worked, so...", "Hahaha, yes", "I started wearing men's jeans just to have normal size pockets", "I laughed out loud at this - because I would have done the exact same thing, and because a wedding dress with pockets is *awesome*.", "Right. At one point I dropped to size 10. I found all these jeans for 10 bucks at target. My announcement was i lost enough weight to wear these size 10 jeans that were 10 dollars. \n\nLol both seemed like big accomplishments", "Exactly this ^", "I sew and get comments from people about wishing they knew how to do it. I always offer to teach them some basics or even help walk them through a project. With only one exception, what they really mean is that they want me to do the thing for them. One time even, a friend who also sews agreed to do some alterations on another friend's daughter's prom dress. Once she got it, she wasn't sure how to do what it needed and called me to get a 2nd opinion. I was able to work out how to do it, at which point she declared it was beyond her skill set and sent the dress home with me to do the alterations. \ud83e\udd23 I truly don't mind helping people with things like that when I can and many seem quite interested in how it's done, but almost none of them actually want to learn how to do it themselves.", "BF sounds like a status-conscious social climber wannabe. IMO, maybe OP can gift herself a new BF for Christmas.", "I don't think you should change a thing about your reply - your skills are obviously excellent, and older clothing is often higher quality to begin with. \n\nThat being said, if you wanted a new script in your pocket to mollify the BF, you could always say 'it's vintage, and I tailored it to fit' rather than thrifted. It changes nothing about the truth except that 'vintage' sounds posher than 'goodwill.'", "NTA I understand why you would feel uncomfortable just saying the name brand. Your bf sounds insecure. What does he want you to say when people ask? \u201cOh this? I have a passion for rescuing vintage fashion and then tailoring them to be more modern! This is one of my latest works!\u201d", "First you're NTA. If anything, as a compromise, you can word it differently. You can say it's an older dress that you tailored. Without specifically saying goodwill, triggering your boyfriend's insecurity or whatever. I agree with everybody here that you are totally in the right and that talking about the price is a socially acceptable display of a skill, but if it means enough to your boyfriend that you're willing to compromise about it that's my best advice.", "\"Oh, a little shop in my neighborhood.\"", "I can\u2019t think of a single person in my life who wouldn\u2019t think that\u2019s cool as shit.

Thanks for posting this link!", "It's also partly a side effect of manufacture and to keep the garment in good condition until you buy it. Since pockets are often half \"outer\" fabric and half \"lining\", if it's folded weird the lining can stretch out permanently, causing the pocket opening to sag.\n\nAnd when you make something like a suit jacket, the pattern tells you to run a quick seam across the top of the pocket to make sure it's sewn on straight. Easier to just not remove that, especially when it helps preserve quality for the customer!", "Do you have any issues with shipping times? I've been tempted to order from them but have seen a lot of negative reviews lately about being charged right away and not getting anything for 5-6 months.", "Hot tip for this: take it apart at the seams, then trace each piece on to pattern paper (adding hem allowances where appropriate). You can reassemble the garment afterwards! \n\nI've never done that last step myself, but my absolute best blouse pattern is a \u20ac70 blouse I got from a high-end officewear store on sale and literally wore out. I stripped it down to pieces, traced the pieces (holding the worn-through fabric very carefully to it's original shape) and have made 2 \"daughter\" blouses (and counting!)", "I literally bring a hugeass hardcover book when purse shopping, and see if I can take it in and out easily.", "\u2026 you\u2019re supposed to cut those?", "I usually get my items within 6 weeks, which is what they usually quote for shipping times. So I plan ahead when I want something and order it early", "I didn't really have an \"issue\" with it, but when I ordered from them it took a good 4 months to ship. If you email them, you'll get a very generic \"Thank you for your business, we were impacted by COVID, etc.\" But when it did finally ship, it was at my door in about a week.", "Lazy tip: \n- if you don't want to take it apart, just stick painter's tape on the garment part; all over each part separately.\n\n- then remove the tape (in one piece, ideally. One garment part at a time) and stick it on pattern paper.\n\nThen add the sewing margins and any needed markings.\n\nEt voil\u00e0! You now have a pattern without taking it apart!", "That's not as good for things that \"seam to curved\" - a lot of the reason my blouse looked as good as it did is because flat individual pieces would naturally sit rounded on the hanger/my body, especially over the arms/shoulders/upper torso. You CAN usually pull each piece flat without taking the whole thing apart, but it's harder to do right. \n\nThe tape trick is also pretty bad at the little darts, gathers etc that set a \"good\" pattern apart from an outstanding one", "This trick work well on simple garments. If it's a complicated piece, of course taking it apart is worth the time and effort. I copied a few simple dresses with the tape trick and it worked wonderfully for me.\n\nNot all tricks are appropriate for all situations."]}
