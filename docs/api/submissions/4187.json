Her BF might be having a different sort of situation at work, one where he's looked down on or has to compete in a different way.

You do need to be aware that at work events, you are partially what your bf is being judged on.  You could have just said I ran across a dress and restructured it myself as sewing and redesign is one of my passions.  There was no need to state it was from goodwill or even that it was used clothing.  I buy used clothing too, so I am not against it at all.  I get that you are proud of what you do and you obviously have skills as I have made clothes and it isn\u2019t that easy especially when handling shiny fabrics. I also get that you are not into consumerism.   The thing is, not everyone is comfortable with used clothing and you pointing out your disdain for purchasing products off the rack could be insulting to your bf\u2019s bosses.  Also plenty of mass produced clothing is made with decent fabrics, it just costs more, so that could be taken as a dog to anyone there that their clothes were not that great.", "NTA \n\nWay to go!!

I think that sustainability is hella important, and thrifting and tailoring are interesting (I sew myself).  I would be happy if my partner talked about that at a work party.\n\nBut I could see that this might not be the impression that Mike wanted you to give.

It's also generally tacky in social convention with strangers to talk about how much something cost.\n\nYou have a talent, and you should be proud of your work.

Then suddenly my clothes aren't cute and they're considered dirty. Some people get weird about it.", "NTA. You're practically designing and making your own dresses and that's supposed to be trashy? It sounds like your boyfriend just wants to feel like everyone thinks he's rich. Kinda pathetic.", "NTA , I hate reading these kind of posts where the boyfriend is clearly an idiot and doesn't have the ability to recognise whats right in front of his face.

I also proudly would tell anyone who complimented my outfit how much stuff cost.

I told her no and proudly mentioned it only cost 7 bucks and where I got it. Her advice was to never tell someone how much you spent. Just take the compliment and walk away. \n\nI kinda agree with her now. I think there are different occasions where information can or should be shared.

If he sees a dress that I might like and it has pockets, he'll bring it right over. He never realized it was a big deal until we went out and everyone raved about my dress with real pockets.

In my experience anyway.", "My partner understands why I like pockets when I\u2019ve accidentally left my phone places because I couldn\u2019t just stick it in my dress pocket.

Surely he knows that she does this, and that at social events it comes up, and she'll talk about it.  if he didn't say, \"Hey, maybe you could suggest that you tailored an off-the-rack dress, rather than saying it was from Goodwill,\" then that's his screw up, not OP's.\n\nAs I posted elsewhere, I'm certainly used to this emotional labor.\n\nIt's a pretty crap thing to require this of partners, though, and I think that the professions that do, should rethink their requirements.\n\nSoftware development has plenty of growing up to do, but I noticed that nobody gave AF about what my partner chatted about.

For cons I just add the right accessories to suit what ever character I want to play.
