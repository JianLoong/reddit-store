Apart from sustainability, it's just an amazing skill and talent. You talking about it, especially when prompted, is completely fine. Your bf seems insecure and his \"has an image to uphold\" mentality seems really gross and unfortunate. You're a person, not a trophy and making your own clothes doesn't equate to poverty or low class. Not that there is even anything wrong with being poor. Just, very strange.

Considering that you were getting compliments and had people interested in your ideas, I think you were a credit to your boyfriend and he should have been proud. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of about shopping at goodwill and thrift stores. They have some of the best stuff and repurposing things is a big business. Those corporate people don\u2019t always come from money or had the best jobs so it could have reminded them that they all started somewhere and that there might be someone who isn\u2019t fake and all about the money.

He should be proud, seriously. Why shouldn\u2019t you be able to share it? \n\nHe probably thinks it makes him/you/both of you look cheap for you to mention shopping at thrift stores but it shouldn\u2019t? You can find nice stuff at thrift stores. New clothes these days are so expensive and made so cheaply that most of my thrift store purchases last much longer than my new purchases.

This man is insecure, judgemental, and out of touch with reality.  You deserve better.  I\u2019m a university professor and I sometimes hang out with the very well-healed.

I think your boyfriend's fears that this makes you look cheap/low-status are unwarranted.

The two things that jumped to my mind are either that your boyfriend is jealous of the positive attention you got at the party and he feels insecure that you\u2019re more talented than him, or that he has some serious issues with class/money stuff and you two have some big value mismatches.
