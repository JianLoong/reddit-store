I mentioned that to him and he apologized and said he'll be more careful and clean it up.

At first I was super upset but then I thought that maybe it was an overreaction because it's not something that can't be cleaned or something that he can't stop doing.

Tell your parents he can come live with them.", "NTA. I'm 54 and have never even considered peeing in any sink. Maybe I would pee outside if truly desperate. But peeing in the sink is something dudes who think they'll never clean the bathroom do. \n\nAdult men who clean their own bathrooms use the toilet like adults. Also if he's missing the toilet, he should pee sitting down. Or at the very least clean up his own mess. \n\nAlso, making the false comparison of the fact that women menstruate to dirty and uncleaned piss outside of the bowl is an immature ad hominem which, if I were you, would have been the sole reason for kicking his dirty ass out. \n\nMen are the absolute worst.
