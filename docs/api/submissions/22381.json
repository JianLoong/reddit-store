I mentioned that to him and he apologized and said he'll be more careful and clean it up. But he also added he saw I had thrown out pads implying it was gross (it's a closed trash can). \n\nOne day we were hanging out in the living room and he laughed at a TikTok and showed it to me. It was something along the lines of men peeing in sinks or whatever, so I asked him if he does that or if he had done it here to which he laughed and said yes. \n\nI told him that it's disgusting considering it's not his bathroom he's doing it in and that I have probably touched the sink after he had done that. I kind of kept going and told him to stop doing that or start packing his bags. He said I was overreacting and called me selfish and that he's not dirty and this is not a big deal.

My parents say I'm being mean and didn't believe me when I said he pees in the sink. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify that he didn't pee in the sink because of an emergency but did it while he was in the bathroom with a working toilet next to him. Didn't pee in the kitchen sink as far as I know. I do have things on my sink (toothbrush, soap etc) that I've already replaced. He also didn't exclusively pee in the sink, just when he was in a hurry or it's more \"convenient\". I also didn't kick him out straight away after I found out he does it, obviously. He's also not doing it for environmental reasons, saving water or whatever. \n\nI also don't care whether people piss in their sinks or not.

He's disgusting. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIf I wanted to be a mean girl\u2026I would just show him everything gross thing he does and every one of his crusty messes and say \u201cthis is why you are single\u201d\n\nThe thing is, and this goes for being a GUEST in anyone else\u2019s home\u2026you have to live on their terms and follow their rules. You are doing him a favor. He should have basic respect for your home.\n\nHe either needs to sit down on the toilet to pee, or clean up after himself. I know men talk about the split stream and such. That\u2019s understandable. You have to wipe that up though. No peeing in the sink. That\u2019s a privilege he has living in his own place. You have standards and don\u2019t want to live in squalor. \n\nOn the topic of sorta monopolizing the living room\u2026sure he\u2019s sleeping out there. He needs to understand that it\u2019s a shared space just like the bathroom. He needs to fold up the pullout mattress, put the throw pillows back, and fold any blankets he\u2019s using every day. He needs to pick up any trash he accumulates in there at least once a day.\n\nAlso, idk about you but I have bills. I don\u2019t get help from family or anything. It\u2019s no biggie or anything. I\u2019m not complaining, but idc who it is. If someone is living with me for a month using water, electricity, (possibly?) eating my groceries, etc. they should at least be tidy. If I\u2019m not asking for anything other than that they respect my space and belongings\u2026they will have to comply or see themselves out.\n\nIf you\u2019re parents give you shit tell them \u201cmaybe he should stay with you guys so you can potty train him again. He need a refresher course in how and where to go to the bathroom.\u201d", "NTA I'm a 52 y/o man. I don't pee in the sink. That's absolutely gross. He should be ashamed of himself, and for him to proudly admit that he did pee in the sink makes it even worse.", "Maybe they broke up because he peed in his boyfriend's sink too. \n\nNTA.", "Personally, NTA. Had a roommate that was doing the same, found out that he would also use the kitchen sink when we weren't around and pretend like he wasn't.\n\nIcing on the cake was that he would *refuse* to use toilet paper even though we bought it and didn't charge him anything besides rent. If he took a shit, he would take his clothes off, get in the shower, and rinse his ass. Two times he shat in the shower directly and washed it down, so that he \"didn't have to deal with getting in the shower afterward.\"\n\nHard pass. Never again.", "There's this fantastic thing called a toilet, usually in the same room as the sink. If he can't be bothered to clean the toilet, the least he can do is USE the toilet rather than somewhere people use to brush their teeth. That's rancid.", "I can understand peeing in the shower/tub in a pinch but the sink?? I've *vomited* in the sink before because I couldn't make it to the toilet but there's no way the sink is that much more convenient than the toilet for a piss. Plus, how tall is your brother and how short is the counter? Is he up on his tiptoes teabagging the countertop?\n\nNTA you're not kicking him out because of the sink, you're kicking him out because he's a filthy and disrespectful guest. It pisses me off double when people pull out the \"well you threw pads/tampons away in there\" as a comeback to something they're doing that's dirty or inappropriate. Uh yeah, that's literally why there's a trash bin in the bathroom, why are you digging around in it?", "YTA. Peeing in sinks is fine. Stop licking the sink, sweetheart.", "YTA, it's pee not the blood of orphans.  It's really not that big of a deal.", "If he simply doesn't want to get out bed, tell him to get an empty mayonnaise jar and use it to pee in, and put the lid on tight so he doesn't accidentally spill it, and then empty & clean it each day .\n\nOr tell him you want rent money, but make it expensive enough that he will move out", "wow fuck that guy, so happy you moved out so quickly! what kind of fucking psycho hurts a disabled kitty.", "Good thing he didn't tell OP about his waffle stomping.  She really would have hated that.", "We have a pole in the back yard we pee on. That way we feel like the rich elites pissing on the pee pole", "Why the fuck wouldn't there be a toilet in the bathroom???", "Thank you for sharing this with a great reference.", "Your brother must be the favourite child? Send him to mum and dads to piss in their sink. Also it\u2019s your home and you can throw whatever you like in the bin. If a man (related or otherwise) entered my home and complain that I threw a pad in my bin (designated bathroom bin or main bin) they would have been out of their ass that moment. Choosing beggars am I right ?", "YTA\nPeeing in the sink saves water and isn't that gross as long as you rinse the sink afterwards.\nClearly you're upset he is a slob and are just looking for an excuse to kick him out.", "Not having a choice is very different to \u2019for the lulz\u2019 imo."]}
