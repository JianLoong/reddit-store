Individually, they're not such horrendous offenses, but all together you just look like a jerk who doesn't care about important relationship dates which easily becomes your gf's interpretation: you don't care about the relationship. You'll accommodate yourself, your colleagues and your parents before her, even on days most people would understand and expect you to put plans with her first.\n\nAnd I could still fall on the side of your mom--the way we celebrate V-day is largely a money grab from companies selling the idea of romance. It's great for those that want to celebrate it, but it's a pretty arbitrary date given that it's focus is on individual couples, not a world/culture wide thing.  HOWEVER that take generally goes along with the idea that both members of the couple share the view that it's not important OR that they agree the *date* isn't important and they *celebrate on a different day*.
