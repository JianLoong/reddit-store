Obviously the cat hates the literrobot and that can happen. She should've reacted a lot sooner. As a cat owner, she should also know that if she doesn't \"fix\" that behaviour of the cat soon by offering different/more litterboxes, not only will the cat keep doing it, but it might become harder to change it in the future, up to the point of it being irreversible.

Of course, it will either never flush or discover a fascination with the flushing mechanism and flush incessantly. \n\nMy coworker\u2019s cat uses the toilet unless she\u2019s upset. Then she leaves a \u201cgift\u201d right next to the toilet to show she cold have used it but is making a point instead.", "NTA. What does she expect to do? Keep the disused robot and allow the animal to defecate everywhere? What would be the point of that? She should sell the robot and go back to using a litter tray or let the cat out to do that.", "NTA but the solution isn\u2019t to lock the cat up, it\u2019s to get rid of the litter box or re-introduce the cat to it. The way things are now is kind of uncool to the cat - she has nowhere to go because she\u2019s scared of her litter box and out of desperation she\u2019s trying to find other places. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d put a regular litter box down for the cat so she has somewhere to go. I know she\u2019s not your cat but it would solve the problem in the short term and give the cat some relief.", "NTA! WTF would want cat crap+ all over their clothing, bedding, hamper etc.? Your sisters lax attitude makes her the AH here times 10! Yes, it IS her responsibility, yes, the onus is on her, and you shouldn't have to worry about closing doors in your own home. It's just nasty, unsanitary, the odor will get worse, and the cat will be harder to train. Your sister needs to get it together or they should both go, and she can let her cat crap all over her stuff instead. That's just nasty!", "NTA.

Sister needs to get a new cat!", "NTA, but invest in a waterproof mattress cover. I have cats who puke (hairballs, much joy) and have a cal king foam bed. The mattress cover isn't that plastic crap that makes noise and works extremely well. It's basically rubberized on the under side, you literally can't tell if it has a sheet on it.", "Anything of yours the cat poops on you take to her bedroom door way and shake it off into her room.  She can then clean up after her cat.  (Not that it should be allowed to happen in the first place but so far she has no consequences and this will provide a lovely surprise)", "NTA it\u2019s a known thing that all these litter box \u201cconveniences\u201d are designed for humans, not cats. Some people get lucky and their cats don\u2019t mind using a moving, noise making machine or a cave that concentrates all the smell right where they can\u2019t escape it with their sensitive noses or whatever they came up with to save humans the sight or trouble of having a litter box. But a lot of cats won\u2019t and the longer she lets this go on, the more it will become entrenched in the cat\u2019s mind that the bath mats and whatnot are acceptable places to use.", "NTA at all\n\nHER cat HER problem", "NTA Your sister is obviously lazy, I have four cats and clean the litter(s) every second day by hand. As well as clipping claws every two weeks, or so it depends. \n\nOn a side note, if the cat hates the litter box that much your sister is causing unnecessary stress on the cat, which is obvious because cats don't usually use the bathroom in such places as you are saying. \n\nIf the cat remains too stressed out this can cause issues health wise with the cat, and will cost your sister a lot of money at the vet.", "NTA, she needs to get her head on straight and take care of this situation.\n\nThe only thing I will add is that perhaps you can put a regular litterbox down for her somewhere? Keep the cat from being overly stressed and using your items as a toilet. I know it's your sisters cat, but it is still a living thing in your home and it's needs must be met.", "\n>I can understand not wanting to give up on a $700 investment\n\nThe bot has a several month guarantee so she would get a full refund. Dont know about shipping but that would be the only cost. So not really a loss.", "I have one too and while it isn't perfect, I love it. Well, I love it as much as one could love a very expensive toilet. My family calls it the robo pooper. Anyway...\n\nOP, it sounds like your sister isnt using the litter robot correctly. I like /u/LadySmuag's suggestion of leaving the bot off for a while (a month maybe?) and see if the cat starts using it. Just manually clean it. Also have a regular old litter box too nearby. I have also seen people offer treats nearby as the litter bot rotates to help teach its fine. \n\nAlso is the bot in a dark, secluded area of the house? Put it somewhere more public and with light. Personally I do use a secluded dedicated \"cat bathroom\" but I leave the light on 24/7 and its right next to my office and not, say, downstairs in an unpleasant lonely basement next to a loud scary laundry machine.\n\nAs for judgement, NTA. Not your cat so this isn't actually your problem. Your sister is TA for being willing to spend so much for her own convenience but not helping her cat adjust.\n\nAlso, I want to see a video of a cat stalking the litter robot now lol.", "She's probably waiting to see if the cat starts to warm up to it and probably because she's lazy and doesn't want to scoop up her own cats pee and poop AND also probably using the excuse that she spent $700 on something and is not on a tight budget or whatever the fuck. Clear to see OP's sister prefers her own conveniences over the order of the house. \n\nOP: does the cat use the restroom on your sister's things as well? And what's her reaction?\n\nPersonally, I would use a blacklight and physically walk your sister through the accidents in the home she's probably not seeing. Urea shows up on blacklight really well, regardless of if you cleaned the physical mess. Cat urine is rank as fuck, hard to get the smell out and actually needs an enzyme cleaner (not household ones) to truly clean up. Also, most rentals frown upon cats with litter box issues. \n\nYour sister is the major AH. I hope the cat shits and pisses on her clothes and bed to cement the cats stance. \"$700 litter box has to go.\"", "Sunk cost fallacy.", "Maybe she\u2019s holding out hope that the cat will magically decide to like the robot litterbox and she will have all of the fun part of cat ownership without the icky work.\n\nMeanwhile the cat is only peeing on Op\u2019s things in Op\u2019s room, so no problem for her sister - she can wait forever.", "NTA - but has your sister tried setting the timer to a longer period of time being idle (15min) after the cat has done its' business before the robot rotates? I find the 3 min wait is too short.", "I have a litter robot ( best purchase I\u2019ve ever made btw). Has she tried putting litter in it and leaving it off so that the cat gets used to using it? Once the cat gets acclimated to it turn it on.", "ESH. Your sister needs to listen to herscats needs and you need to take responsibility for closing your bedroom door. I have lived with problem pets, shutting your door is a solution you can have to them. Sounds like the cat needs a low tech litter box and a scratching post AND you need to close your door.", "op=NTA\n\nHer cat--her litter box, she needs to get it together.  She can rehome the litterbox--sell it on the marketplace to recoup some of the cost.\n\nEvery time, I've seen these things I think of the fact that my cats would not use it.  My male HATES loud/weird noises.  And my late chunk would have refused to use it because it was too high and too small a space for her to be comfortable in.  The new kitten.  could climb in but her weight might make it think she's not in it and start before she's out(I don't know how they work specifically--so guessing here).\n\nIn the end she should have had two options available for cat esp. while introducing a new litterbox.  This way until the cat decided it LIKED the new option, it would still have a place to do it's business OTHER than your clothing or bath mat.", "NTA.  I used to foster kittens, and one time the adopting lady returned 2 (litter-trained) kittens to the shelter, complaining that they used her white carpet after she spent hundreds of $ on some litterbox -- we guessed robotic.  The kittens came back to me for more fostering, and they were fine after getting over the trauma of a demon-possessed litterbox.", "NTA the cat isn't going to start using the new litter tray a normal tray with litter is so cheap to get I dont understand her hold up. All she needs to do is clean the robot one and sell it and get a normal tray again", "I do close my door, but I forget sometimes. However, that doesn't put the onus of the situation on me. The problem isn't my door being closed. I don't have to take responsibility for anything, because the core of this problem is not with me. Nor is any of the cause. Nor should I have to live with my door shut 24/7 now.", "NTA, and it sounds loke your sister didn't follow the recommended way to introduce the cat to the litter robot snd is now having an issue. \nI'm not even sure this can be fixed, the cat may never like the device due to not being properly introduced.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m loving the image I have in my head of the kitty stalking it\u2019s litter box. So cute\u2026. NTA\u2026 they don\u2019t links it.", "NTA, but I do think you shouldn't ask her to lock her cat in her room... that's not fair to the cat and could cause more problems.", "NTA. I feel sorry for you AND that poor cat!!! Does she not realize how traumatized that cat is? What's the point of the having the fancy litterbox around if the cat isn't using it anyway?", "NTA.  Why have a litter robot thing is the cat won\u2019t use it?  Better to get an old fashioned box and litter, and clean it the old fashioned way.", "NTA.  If you are in a rental, you can probably kiss your cleaning deposit goodbye. Cat pee lingers forever and it will soak into flooring, carpet, carpet pad, etc.", "Cat goes on your clothes? Put them on sister's bed. Cat goes on the floor or in your planter? Scoop it and put it in sister's room. Make it awful for sister to not act.\n\nNTA, and sister is terrorising the cat. It's going everywhere because its stress is off the charts. Poor thing.", "NTA, but your ultimatum of getting rid of the litter robot is way too much. Put the cat's old litter box back, slowly let the cat get acclimated to the litter robot, and make the full switch when the cat is comfortable with it. The litter robot doesn't need to go, but your sister definitely needs to do a better job of introducing her cat to it. The cat's reaction is a reason why they provide you with all of that info to help you gently introduce your cat to it.", "I also have one (well, I have the previous model, which was about $500). Two cats took to it immediately. One never did before he passed, and the last took several months, but she uses it now. With 3 cats, I empty it maybe twice a week, and there's significantly less litter box smell in the house. That thing saved my sanity and I will never go back to a normal box full-time.\n\nBut yeah, I'm pretty sure they say to leave it unplugged until the cat starts using it to begin with. She messed up by not doing that. If I remember right, you leave it powered off next to their old box and clean the old box less often. You can even move some of the litter from their old box into the new one, so the smell is in there. As they start using it, I think you manually tell it to clean, so they can get used to the sound from it after using it (although the latest model is SO much quieter!). As long as they keep using it, you end up leaving it plugged in and gradually get rid of the old box.", "DING DING DING!  We have a winnah!", "You're not supposed to turn that thing on for a couple of weeks so the cat gets used to it in the first place. It's too late now she's already made the cat afraid of it.", "It's outright cruel to keep doing this to the cat.", "I once made the mistake of switching to a covered litterbox as the only option in a multi-cat household, because my male liked to pee standing up (not squatting), thus spraying urine over the sides. Well, one of my female cats hated the covered box, because she felt like the aggressive male could literally trap her inside. So she went looking for an alternative, and settled on my husband's tool box. Did you know cat urine could eat through metal? \ud83e\udd2f In the end, I kept the covered box but added a high-sided open one as well.
