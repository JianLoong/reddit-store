Cause I have a feeling she doesn't care if the cat is using the robot or not because either way she doesn't have to do the work.", "NTA, I really think you hit the nail on the head with a lot of your reasons telling her to get rid of the litterbox. And something you didn't mention which should be the most important thing, her cat is seriously stressed out. If your cat is so freaked out where they're peeing and pooping on everything and hissing at their litter box, that's not healthy for the cat. \n\nI can understand not wanting to give up on a $700 investment but minimally she needs to immediately get a regular litter box so that the cat has somewhere \"safe\" can do its business during the transition.", "NTA, but your sister messed up introducing the cat to the litter robot. \n\nI have one and when you open the box there's a giant QR code that links to a video explaining how to set it up *and how to introduce it to your cat.*\n\nDuring the introduction period, the cat should still have their old litter box available as a safety net to prevent this exact problem. I also would recommend turning off the litter robot for the time being so that it is a 'dumb' litter box until the cat is confident going in and out of it.", "NTA\n\nI'm confused by your sister's position here.

It\u2019s her cat and her responsibility.", "NTA, tell her to try and sell it for some reimbursement but it\u2019s clearly not working in your home", "NTA. It's reasonable to expect people to take care of their pets.", "NTA. WTF? \n\nHow can your sister be so oblivious to both your and her cat's needs? Obviously the cat hates the literrobot and that can happen. She should've reacted a lot sooner. As a cat owner, she should also know that if she doesn't \"fix\" that behaviour of the cat soon by offering different/more litterboxes, not only will the cat keep doing it, but it might become harder to change it in the future, up to the point of it being irreversible. Your sister is being a totally irresponsible pet owner on top of being an irresponsible roommate.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, just being realistic, closing your doors is the best solution moving forward. Letting your stuff get pissed and shat on isn't going to make anyone jump to a new decision. It's only hurting your wallet.\n\nHow your sister doesn't think that this is a problem is mind-boggling. Maybe shutting your doors will force her cat to piss and shit on her stuff, which will get her motivated for a solution.", "NTA, she sounds really lazy. Cats can be super particular, I can\u2019t even have a cover over my cats litter box because then she won\u2019t use it and will pee everywhere. So I just have a pan with litter. I don\u2019t love it, but it\u2019s better than pee everywhere. \n\n\nPS: Just letting you know that the purple mattresses are made of fiberglass and you\u2019re probably coating yourself and your lungs in it.", "NTA. She should just sell it and get a normal litter box. Issue fixed.", "NTA.  Has she read the user manual?   They suggest not having the litter bot run automatically to initially introduce the device to the cat and also to have the old litter box accessible.   She can also email or call tech support for help and tips.", "NTA  Her pet, her responsibility.  \n\nBut yeah, do work on keeping your door shut and your clothes off the floor in common areas.  Once cats get into the habit of using random places for their business, they will often continue to do so even when there are better options.  Your sister is allowing the cat to start bad habits that may be hard to reverse, even if the robo-litter box is removed.", "NTA and if the cat is only peeing on your stuff he's claimed you as his human.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Either that or she\u2019s going to have to pay to buy you new things every time the cat pees or poops on your stuff.", "NTA \n\nThe obvious solution is to get rid of the robot and let the cat recover from her fear.\n\nAfter everything calms down it might be willing to be trained to use the toilet with one of those graduated plastic rings method. Of course, it will either never flush or discover a fascination with the flushing mechanism and flush incessantly. \n\nMy coworker\u2019s cat uses the toilet unless she\u2019s upset. Then she leaves a \u201cgift\u201d right next to the toilet to show she cold have used it but is making a point instead.", "NTA. What does she expect to do? Keep the disused robot and allow the animal to defecate everywhere? What would be the point of that? She should sell the robot and go back to using a litter tray or let the cat out to do that.", "NTA but the solution isn\u2019t to lock the cat up, it\u2019s to get rid of the litter box or re-introduce the cat to it. The way things are now is kind of uncool to the cat - she has nowhere to go because she\u2019s scared of her litter box and out of desperation she\u2019s trying to find other places. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d put a regular litter box down for the cat so she has somewhere to go. I know she\u2019s not your cat but it would solve the problem in the short term and give the cat some relief.", "NTA! WTF would want cat crap+ all over their clothing, bedding, hamper etc.? Your sisters lax attitude makes her the AH here times 10! Yes, it IS her responsibility, yes, the onus is on her, and you shouldn't have to worry about closing doors in your own home. It's just nasty, unsanitary, the odor will get worse, and the cat will be harder to train. Your sister needs to get it together or they should both go, and she can let her cat crap all over her stuff instead. That's just nasty!", "NTA. It sucks that she basically wasted $700, but that's how cats are sometimes, and it's her responsibility to make sure her cat doesn't shit/piss all over the home.", "NTA it's quite obvious the cat is defective. Sister needs to get a new cat!", "NTA, but invest in a waterproof mattress cover. I have cats who puke (hairballs, much joy) and have a cal king foam bed. The mattress cover isn't that plastic crap that makes noise and works extremely well. It's basically rubberized on the under side, you literally can't tell if it has a sheet on it.", "Anything of yours the cat poops on you take to her bedroom door way and shake it off into her room.  She can then clean up after her cat.  (Not that it should be allowed to happen in the first place but so far she has no consequences and this will provide a lovely surprise)", "NTA it\u2019s a known thing that all these litter box \u201cconveniences\u201d are designed for humans, not cats. Some people get lucky and their cats don\u2019t mind using a moving, noise making machine or a cave that concentrates all the smell right where they can\u2019t escape it with their sensitive noses or whatever they came up with to save humans the sight or trouble of having a litter box. But a lot of cats won\u2019t and the longer she lets this go on, the more it will become entrenched in the cat\u2019s mind that the bath mats and whatnot are acceptable places to use.", "NTA at all\n\nHER cat HER problem", "NTA Your sister is obviously lazy, I have four cats and clean the litter(s) every second day by hand. As well as clipping claws every two weeks, or so it depends. \n\nOn a side note, if the cat hates the litter box that much your sister is causing unnecessary stress on the cat, which is obvious because cats don't usually use the bathroom in such places as you are saying. \n\nIf the cat remains too stressed out this can cause issues health wise with the cat, and will cost your sister a lot of money at the vet.", "NTA, she needs to get her head on straight and take care of this situation.\n\nThe only thing I will add is that perhaps you can put a regular litterbox down for her somewhere? Keep the cat from being overly stressed and using your items as a toilet. I know it's your sisters cat, but it is still a living thing in your home and it's needs must be met.", "\n>I can understand not wanting to give up on a $700 investment\n\nThe bot has a several month guarantee so she would get a full refund. Dont know about shipping but that would be the only cost. So not really a loss.", "I have one too and while it isn't perfect, I love it. Well, I love it as much as one could love a very expensive toilet. My family calls it the robo pooper. Anyway...\n\nOP, it sounds like your sister isnt using the litter robot correctly. I like /u/LadySmuag's suggestion of leaving the bot off for a while (a month maybe?) and see if the cat starts using it. Just manually clean it. Also have a regular old litter box too nearby. I have also seen people offer treats nearby as the litter bot rotates to help teach its fine. \n\nAlso is the bot in a dark, secluded area of the house? Put it somewhere more public and with light. Personally I do use a secluded dedicated \"cat bathroom\" but I leave the light on 24/7 and its right next to my office and not, say, downstairs in an unpleasant lonely basement next to a loud scary laundry machine.\n\nAs for judgement, NTA. Not your cat so this isn't actually your problem. Your sister is TA for being willing to spend so much for her own convenience but not helping her cat adjust.\n\nAlso, I want to see a video of a cat stalking the litter robot now lol.", "She's probably waiting to see if the cat starts to warm up to it and probably because she's lazy and doesn't want to scoop up her own cats pee and poop AND also probably using the excuse that she spent $700 on something and is not on a tight budget or whatever the fuck. Clear to see OP's sister prefers her own conveniences over the order of the house. \n\nOP: does the cat use the restroom on your sister's things as well? And what's her reaction?\n\nPersonally, I would use a blacklight and physically walk your sister through the accidents in the home she's probably not seeing. Urea shows up on blacklight really well, regardless of if you cleaned the physical mess. Cat urine is rank as fuck, hard to get the smell out and actually needs an enzyme cleaner (not household ones) to truly clean up. Also, most rentals frown upon cats with litter box issues. \n\nYour sister is the major AH. I hope the cat shits and pisses on her clothes and bed to cement the cats stance. \"$700 litter box has to go.\"", "Sunk cost fallacy.", "Maybe she\u2019s holding out hope that the cat will magically decide to like the robot litterbox and she will have all of the fun part of cat ownership without the icky work.\n\nMeanwhile the cat is only peeing on Op\u2019s things in Op\u2019s room, so no problem for her sister - she can wait forever."]}
