They know it's false, the accusations they make.  **They say these things just to keep us in the conversation and talking with them.**  I could see her thinking that she could demand looking at your phone to get proof, if you had stayed to listen and defend yourself.

For 75% of the time we had adult supervision btw. Anyways once you move out it gets better, when she sees you're not something she can control she will either get better or a whole lot worse. The good thing about you having moved out though is that her being a whole lot worse won't be your problem.\n\nIn the meantime you wanna separate finances. If you don't have a job I would recommend one. Especially if you can get one in walking distance. Once you have a job don't tell her exactly how much you make and get your payday in cash.
