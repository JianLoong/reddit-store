A parent calling their child \"whore\" or other demeaning, dehumanising terms like that is flat-out abusive, period. Even if she had actual concerns about your behaviour, which it sounds like she doesn't have any legitimate reason to have, she should NEVER be trying to shame or demean you like that. \n\nI won't say that you're \"an adult\", because while you are the legal age of majority you're still a teenager and have a lot of growing to do, but if anything, that means she should still be caring for and supporting you emotionally. You are NTA. You have a right to privacy, and more importantly you have a right to love and kindness from your mother. I'm really sorry that she hasn't given you that.", "NTA. you\u2019re 18,an adult. You don\u2019t need someone going through your phone and intruding on your privacy", "NTA - you have a right to privacy.", "NTA. You are entitled to your privacy even if you don't have anything to hide. If she accidentally locked it, all she had to do was to give the phone back to you so you unlock it and then have it back to keep doing whatever she was doing.", "Nope your an adult. She has no need to be in your phone .", "Nta", "Nta even without taking into account that she's previously used peoples private info against them. \n\nAre you on her phone plan though? If so you need to get off it ASAP she can likely get to much info through the account or track you.", "NTA move out ASAP your mom is toxic and a narcissist", "Why would you even need to ask?

No action you could ever do would make you deserve this.

Also in that case she has literally zero right or claim whatsoever to access your phone, it is your property entirely think of it like any other personal data. Like a ssn, bank account, medical records they are private and also now typically link into smart phones and PayPal/cashapp/zell or whatever that can be used to transfer money. \n\nI'd actually make sure your password/pin on the phone isn't something obvious that she should guess because now she will likely try.", "If she tried I doubt she would be able to guess it", "Good, just thought I'd mention it as something to consider. \n\nI would also work towards moving out, it sounds awful to deal with that.", "NTA your mother is abusive.", "NTA\n\nWhen my kids were teens I found the absolute worst thing to do to them was to take their phones. So when they acted up in any way that was not acceptable I would keep it overnight and it absolutely tortured them. Kids are weird.

Honey, the sooner you get away from her, the better. Can you couch-crash with a friend? Afford to rent a room elsewhere? Are there any other (SANE) relatives you can stay with???", "NTA. I do think if you\u2019re under the roof of the home of your parent(s) or guardian(s) there\u2019s a different level of privacy that a person can expect.

Did your mom buy you that phone and pay for it? Or are you paying your own mo they phone service? If she\u2019s paying for it, she should have access. If she is not; she should not. It\u2019s like her house\u2026 you have a room and she should respect that, but she should be permitted to enter the room when she asks. You may be 18 and you may technically be an adult, but you\u2019re living off mommy. You deserve adult privileges when you earn them by yourself.", "If she doesn't want a relationship with you then she's succeeding when calling you a whore.

Chances are it was for slamming it or locking it - repeatedly \u2014 after you were told not to. My daughter lost her door at age 13, 17, and even 21. I pay for this house (and doors!); privileges are EARNED not demanded nor freely given for crap or disrespectful behavior", "Troll alert", "Why would you doubt her word?  Based on this post, Mom calls her a whore for not sharing a password, and accuses her of posting nudes to the boyfriend.  Screaming this at her while following her as she walks away.  She blackmails people with info found on their phones.\n\nNot a far stretch to believe she removed a door for daughter wearing red lipstick, as the mom sounds really out of it."]}
