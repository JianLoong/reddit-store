A parent calling their child \"whore\" or other demeaning, dehumanising terms like that is flat-out abusive, period. Even if she had actual concerns about your behaviour, which it sounds like she doesn't have any legitimate reason to have, she should NEVER be trying to shame or demean you like that. \n\nI won't say that you're \"an adult\", because while you are the legal age of majority you're still a teenager and have a lot of growing to do, but if anything, that means she should still be caring for and supporting you emotionally. You are NTA. You have a right to privacy, and more importantly you have a right to love and kindness from your mother. I'm really sorry that she hasn't given you that.", "NTA. you\u2019re 18,an adult.

You are entitled to your privacy even if you don't have anything to hide.

She has no need to be in your phone .", "Nta", "Nta even without taking into account that she's previously used peoples private info against them. \n\nAre you on her phone plan though?
