A *cheap* whore.\"\n\nBlunt? Yes. Crass? Probably. True? Absolutely.\n\nTell me again why you married this guy in the first place?\n\nYou're NTA, OP.", "NTA what a disgusting way to think", "NTA. My usual take on \"who pays for the date\" is \"who asked who on the date,\" as the person who *asked* and thus initiated the entire thing happening in the first place should be the one to pay for it, since it was their idea. There should *never* be an expectation of physical intimacy as some kind of correlated compensation for inviting someone on a date and/or paying for it, any more than an expectation that if a woman asks a man on a date, there should be an expectation that he fixes her car or sink or something else as an \"exchange.\" \n\nA date is a way of gauging compatibility, and everyone can have their own hopes or expectations that go along with that. Nobody is likely to go out with someone without hoping that they make some sort of connection, as it would be a lot less hassle for them to just hang around at home and have a nice meal without all the extra trouble if they weren't. Expecting someone to \"put out\" because the other person ponied up for a meal is basically confirming that the person paying thinks that the other person is prostituting themselves, which is demeaning and unfair to say the least.\n\nIf it's a blind date, I can see where \"pay for your own meal\" should apply to both persons, but generally, if your husband expects you to have intimate relations with him because you guys went on a date, and *literally phrases it as such*, he's a pig and you shouldn't feel bad for eating alone when you go out. It would be different by far if he just asked you out for a date night in hopes that you'd get physical afterward, if that's a normal part of your relationship with him, but since he's gone out and said that he only wants to go out with you because you'll have sex later, that ship has sailed.\n\nHonestly, I hope that there's more to your marriage that provides a meaningful connection with him, because he's got some pretty misogynistic, harmful outlooks for husband material in my opinion.", "Chivalry no longer exists.

My assumption would be you at least to some extent share finances so it doesn't really matter which one of you pays.\n\nNo judgment here,  I wasn't there,  but I could see it not being meant the way you took it,  especially as the second half doesn't even make sense if not a joke.", "NTA.\nBut!!! Whenever man complains about dead bedrooms, people in comments always ask, \"Do you take her on dates?\" \"Do you get her flowers?\" \"Do you do tasks for her?\" \n\nSo yeah, I don't see how you can say that it shouldn't be transactional, but then tell men to do things to get sex.\n\nI personally never allowed anyone to pay for anything for me.

That is terrible and no one should feel that way. Secondly,, everything is subjective and we do not truly know each side of the story.   \nHowever, IF this man, husband, feels this is the only way to get closer/intimate with his wife, then that is a major issue.
