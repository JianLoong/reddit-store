Its very common in my country actually for spouses to not share a bank account etc, although I do think that having a shared bank account could help for her to visualize the budget for the family. That said, I doubt my wife would agree to to this as she would most likely see this as some kind of trick to control her money usage.\n\nThe way I see it is, that she gets to spend way more on herself compared to me even thought she gets waaay less money than me. While she does pay for about 70% of our childs clothes, she is buying nice expensive clothes for herself too and buys other kind of expensive stuff. Eventually when she runs out of money each month and even for her own entertainment purposes, Im the one who steps in and makes sure she can go out.\n\nI would have included our policy and views on money to my main post...but the character limit made it impossible.", "We have daycare services nearby that could be easily covered by another family members paycheck if both of us worked. (Yes, in this case it would be my wives paycheck if she would not step into paying other bills). She still could affort a car aswell.  Most of families in our country put the kids into daycare at 1yr old because our economy pretty much works so that If you dont want to live poorly you need both parents to work.\n\nYou also maybe missed my previous reply where we see our moneys as our own, its our policy and I have been extremely flexible with that but having a car is just too expensive.", "Well his budget is also their budget and *they* can't afford the life she wants with one income.  Maybe it's long past time she grows up and has a realistic view of what is and isn't possible.  From the sounds of it she's been making all the financial choices and he's been going along with it to make her happy.  Lots of married couples have his and her money with separate finances.  It's ridiculous that you take such offense to his money but not her spending and refusal to sacrifice anything to do what she wants.", "\nEditing to say that I do agree with you on the \u201cmy money\u201d and \u201cher money\u201d crap. Yeah, if they decided she should be a SAHM then it\u2019s their money. OP is definitely T A H for acting as if he\u2019s the only one who contributes to the family, but NTA for not wanting to purchase a car.\n\n\nThat\u2019s all fine but if the family can\u2019t afford a car they can\u2019t afford one. Yes, OP says technically they could, but it also sounds like they would accumulate debt for a few years as a result of the car. At the very least it would wipe away all of their disposable income and/or ability to save, which is not a good financial position.", "No it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the family\u2019s money. \n\nFinancial decisions should be based on what is in the best interest of the entire family, not just 1 person.", "If wife is finalizing her thesis, maybe the car can wait until she's done and working?

It is very much a team decision of what is in the best interest of your family.\n\nI highly encourage you to ask your wife to make a list of her priorities for your family. Then discuss financial goals & planning to help achieve those objectives. Unfortunately, you are the only person with goals right now. Seems like she\u2019s just winging it. She needs information & an understanding of how family money works. \n\nMy husband & I (married 32 years) struggled for the first 5 years of our marriage on this topic. We had 4 kids under 4 & my husband provided for our entire family. We hired a financial planner to help us plan for our future goals. It was a negotiation & we both had to agree on the plan. We were both responsible for helping the team win. We were able to send 4 kids to private school, build 2 houses & pay for our kids college. That did not happen overnight & we were both responsible for reaching that goal. (One thing we utilized as a tool was reviewing our monthly receipts & expenses together. No blaming but just acknowledging where the money goes. We taught our kids financial responsibility this way as well as. It\u2019s amazing how much people spend on stupid stuff) \n\nYou need a map & a path to get to where you want to go. Then you both need to be on the same path to get there. I wish you both all the best!", "Wow. She sure wants an awful lot for not a lot hey? Also you need to grow a spine and stop allowing this shit. You couldn\u2019t afford a kid and it wasn\u2019t the right time and you knew it. Stop giving the spoiled child everything she wants. You\u2019ve done it every single time and she feels entitled to do whatever the helm she wants and you can just be damned.", "Thank you, you got it!\n\nI have made extreme financial compromises so that my wife could have everything she wanted the exact moment she did want them but now my capabilities have hit the wall yet she does not seem to accept that.", "The problem I notice is\u2026that you call it \u201cyour\u201d money.   This creates a bad family dynamic when you Know the money is not just supporting you.", "Im not saying Im only one contributing to my family My wife does A LOT of work and I have done all I can to support her and our family financially.  I could not include my appreciation to the main post without sounding like a dick due character limit...\n\nIm also aware that some people get upset of the \" my and her money\" talk, but the reality is that we are both using our resources for common goal, which is keeping the family going.\n\nMind you, my wife is the one who doesnt want me to ever see her bank account. She feels like its more private than me.", "Trust me, my money IS the familys money. I often leave to work and leave my credit card for my wife so she can go to Starbucks for a toddler date etc. \n\nI cannot empasis this enough, in theory our moneys are our own but in reality 99% of that goes to my family. We just dont happen to have a joint bank account.", "From her POV I bet she is making the sacrifices as SAHM Even thought thats what she wanted and I hesitantly agreed due possible finance problems...", "This is something I have been thinking of. She seems to want absolutely everything and everything is just not possible. I have been thinking of sitting her down and making her list priorities what se wants and then Id have to explain what needs to happen for those things to be possible. \n\nThings I know se wants:\n\nShe wants to move into a More expensive area,  even If it ment renting and not owning a House. (Rents are expensive too, 3 bedroom we couldt even do in case of second child).\n\nShe also want a car for shorter trips \n\nShe also wants another child and not get a Job which would pay for 1 year of child support when the second child would be born\n\nShe also wants to be SAHM/ do random Job gigs untill all of our children are over 3...", "We could afford a kid thats why I went with it. I calculated that with the new expenses of new house we still would be few hundreds plus a month, but then came ukraine war, inflation, rise of interests etc and now we are more or less net zero after paycheck and income.", "You need to stand firm now.  Tell her you are willing to go to counseling.  Do NOT sign any debt for her.\n\nShe needs to make friends near where you live.  She should look into free or low cost mommy and me groups, or babysitting clubs (you look after my kid, get points that you can use for me to take care of your kid).", "Do you involve your wife in the family budget? She needs to see exactly how much money is coming in and where it goes. Teach her.\n\nThere is also the possibility that you just don't like to spend. You mentioned savings, so I have to wonder if there is quite a substantial amount tucked away that you don't want to part with. \n\nI would never call either of you an asshole without seeing the figures. It could go either way,", "She calls her money more hers than I do mine. I get to spend about 20-50\u20ac a month on myself + necessary clothes. \"My money\" was a lost term the moment we got married. All the savings that get to my account will eventually be used to a bigger house etc.", "INFO : Do you realize she's not treating you as an equal decision making partner, but merely as the ATM paying for what she wants?", "Seems like you wife believes it\u2019s your job to make the money but you don\u2019t have any say in where the money goes. That ain\u2019t gonna work. Y\u2019all may need some help. It appears she has an unreasonable or unhealthy relationship with money. You can\u2019t be the only person responsible for a budget. You will be forever arguing about money. It will create tension, bitterness & resentment. Money has no feelings. It works for you if you control it properly. \n\nMoney is really the only 50/50 split in a marriage imo. There has to be an agreed on, common goal. That means both people are responsible for helping to achieve the goal. If you\u2019re making all the money it\u2019s your wife\u2019s responsibility to stay within the budget to help save for the things the family needs. \n\nAnother tool we used is if we didn\u2019t have the cash to pay for something we \u201cwanted\u201d (not needed. Needs are different) then we didn\u2019t do, buy, go until we saved enough money to do it. Immediate gratification will not help your family save money. I understand what it is like to be a SAHM with lots of little kids holding me hostage but money is not necessary to get out of the house & do things. Libraries are free. Walks around town are free. Playing outside & discovering nature are free. Lots of Mom groups out there \u2026 most are free.\n\neta \u2014 I ran a business out of my home (event planning) until our youngest started kindergarten. I then moved my business to a brick & mortar building. I ran the business around my husband & kid\u2019s schedules for 20+ years. Fast forward to today have 9 full time & 3 part-time employees, I\u2019m selling the business at the end of this year & retiring. At 54.\n\neta more \u2014 my husband & I are not making millions. We share the same values & priorities about our family & money. We have always lived within our means. Our kids are not spoiled, they have all had jobs since they were able to work. We don\u2019t need to impress others & we certainly do not need \u201cstuff\u201d. We have a healthy & happy marriage & family. It\u2019s not easy or simple but it\u2019s well worth your time & energy to get on the same page with your financial goals.", "NTA- but it sounds like she needs to get a weekend job or start increasing her \u201cgig\u201d work. She could also look into seeing if she can get a job where she can bring the kid for example working at a daycare. You can tell her until she can pay for a car in full then no car.", "You don't need 3 bedrooms right away.  There's nothing wrong with young siblings sharing a room, even if same gender.", "We have this open daycare nearby where she has made some familiar faces, but she does keep complaining every time when she needs to get further with our kid.\n\nI am planning to stand my ground, I just needed assurance since I had no one else to talk with.", "I openly tell my wife how much money there is if the discussion is about it. Last time I opened the numbers was about 2 months ago when she started to demand that we wont be living in this area that we moved 1 year ago and bought a house from... (It was a decision we both agreed on)\n\nI DO have more savings than maybe a guy usually at my age. Im not a millionare though or super rich. Most of my savings have accumulated over 8 years of working + financial support from my parents that helped us ALOT to aquire home we are living in. If I purchased say a car that would be atleast slightly decent (say it costs 10k) + the required parking lot which costs anything from 7k to 20k at our area, We would loose 60-80% of our savings. Sure we still would have some backup net and if I KNEW that we would not be having more kids, moving to another more expensive area etc, I could maybe look past this and just buy the damn car and the lot and be done with it hoping  my wife eventually went to working, but those savings are also for providing us a better home within 5 years as my wife has STATED that she does not want to live here forever.", "It wasn\u2019t a lost term because you are using it now.  You said you paid for things like her festival tickets.  \nYou are still seeing this as your money since she is currently a SAHM/student.", "I have grown more worried over time that my wife doesnt actually have a very good sense of budgetting life when it comes to sacrifising something she does want. Thing is, I cant find out the complete truth before she actually gets a Job and starts paying some bills.", "I do not think this is healthy for your wife or the baby to be isolated.   I know it is not easy for introverted people, she needs to make new friends.  Frankly, IMHO, the easist time to make new friends is when you have new baby and meet other new parents.  You talk about schools, etc.   \n\nWhen does she expect to finish her thesis?   Is their a timeline.", "Are there car sharing services available where you live?\n\nI live in a metropolitan area with good public transportation, so many people have no use for cars year round.  There are companies that allow very short-term (like for a few hours) rentals for people with occasional need for a car.", "Of course there are a lot more expenses involved in car ownership other than insurance, parking and gas. After a few years, every time you take it in to be serviced there can be repair bills that cost thousands. \n\nDon't let her talk her into anything that you can't afford.\n\nOk, I will say you have earned the NTA. :)", "I dont think you get it, but things might get lost in translation or culture differences. My point of view is that Im happy as long as our total balance stays positive. \n\nI mentioned the tickets etc to point out that Im not keeping my wife on some financial leash or trying to hold as much money for myself,  go out myself etc while my wife gets to do nothing. Im supporting her wellbeing by letting her use the money I get.", "That's not going to happen.  She'll keep wanting more kids so she doesn't have to work, then she'll extend being a SAHM after they start school, and want a larger car to take them to activities etc. \n\nShe's not going to get a job outside of SAHM.", "The thesis is almost done. She has been talking that grinding her gears so I hope that helps some. \n\nI mean we do live in a pretty crowded place and frankly we do NOT live in a remote place or anything like that. Hell a Buss takes you to Capital center each 7 minutes., I do agree that she needs to make friends but since most Moms go to work when child turns 1...there arent too many moms at same stage.", "I suppose there are some, but Idk how my wife would feel about renting always a different car. She would have to install a baby seat each time etc and Idk If thats Even possible. I like the idea though!", "Stop.  You said your money!  Specifically, you said you paid for this, you paid for that.  \nIf it is the one source of income for a married couple\u2026.its the family money. That flat and simple.  \nThen..if she starts working, sit down and discuss the financial status.  Simple.", "Maybe she could find a group on weekends?
