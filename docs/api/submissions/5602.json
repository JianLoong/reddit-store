Two had their own rooms, I shared a room with another girl, and two girls shared the living room. We all shared one bathroom, the house didn't have hot water or a working heater. This house's rent each month is $3400. \n\nI told them I was moving, found a replacement, and they moved in. They don't like her or how much stuff she has, she wants something better despite touring the place and deciding to move in. They saw my online ads as well and knew what day I was moving out and when they could expect the new roommate. \n\nI work six days a week and was moving out myself, I honestly didn't take the time to talk to everyone in the house about the new girl or her things, but I also didn't know how much shit she was moving in with. They claimed that I didn't tell them I was moving out, she was moving in, or giving any personal information about her. I did tell them these things. \n\nSo I was blamed for this and my housemates said I'm responsible for letting her live there for two weeks, find another replacement during these two weeks while working full-time, reimburse her the prorated rent and reduced deposit that she gave to me, and the replacement girl also wants me to reimburse her $800 moving company cost which she booked herself and I had nothing to do with, and pay January rent. \n\nWhen I moved I signed a tiny rental agreement document stating the house cost, tenant responsibilities, lease duration, and occupants names. I honestly think that one of the housemates typed this, because she brought the same copy out to argue and say I lied about the pricing and the house cost is crossed out and rewritten in a pink pen, with an extra condition written at the bottom in a pink pen saying, \"tenant responsible for finding a replacement.\" And a bunch of forged signatures also in the same pink pen. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I just ghost them and let them deal with this? I found a replacement, it's just not on their terms and their mad. I'm not waking up at 6am everyday before work to walk 40 minutes to show the apartment with the tenant replacement I found to other prospective tenants until I find someone that meets the personal standards set by my housemates, or pay January rent for a place that I don't even live in anymore.", "created_utc": 1671953996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zutcou/aita_for_moving_out_and_refusing_to_pay_rent/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I work full time and commute 45+ minutes everyday by train and was moving into my new place as well, so I was preoccupied with so many things. I also never thought I had to do these things, because it's kind of \"fend for yourself and keep to yourself\" at the house with the girls I lived with, and they would have \"house meetings\" without me so I just gave the same transparency to them. \n\nI did tell the girl it's a shared room, you live with five other girls, you share one bathroom, it's not ideal, but it's cheap and she was in a dangerous situation that she was desperate to move out of. She saw pictures, videos, and toured the place in person before she booked a moving company and moved in. \n\nI don't feel responsible for paying for her moving company like she wants, and giving her back her prorated rent and deposit so that she can use $1,360 to move out, and pay another $1,300 for rent for both places in January. I don't think that I be gaslit into being expected to be pay $2,660 for communication issues that are not entirely my fault.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
