If anyone's curious I'm 22 and my step sister is 24\n\nSo we're going to Canada on vacation with my mom's side of the family - mom, step dad, 2 step sisters (this post is about \"Annie\", fake name), BIL and step brother.\n\nParents want it to be a close family vacation, which I can get so no friends, boyfriend, girlfriend so on are invited. I've would've liked my bf to come, but I didn't mind until I heard my parents were changing the rules.\n\nAnnie has a medical condition. She's a lot closer to her mom than my step dad (her bio dad) and step dad says he doesn't think he can spend the time with Annie if she needs assistance. They're allowing Annie to bring her bf because she apparently feels the most comfortable around him, and he can support her if needed.\n\nI think it's hypocritical of them to allow Annie to bring her bf, but not mine. She would have her dad there, also us which is supposed to be the point of the family vacation. I told them I also feel comfortable around my bf, so if that's the reason he should be allowed to come too. Step dad said no, and mom said she gets my point but Annie isn't the same as us.\n\nI told them if they're going to change the rules like this, I don't want to go.\n\nNow mom is pissed at me and said I'm being selfish about our vacation.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdited to add, Annie is blind", "created_utc": 1675605277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uczru/aita_for_backing_out_of_family_vacation_because/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When asked how long your sister and her boyfriend have been dating you replied and then deleted:\n\n> Around 3 years, but honestly, I wouldn't call him a boyfriend, more a caregiver. I think he's with her because he feels sorry for her\n\nYou're an epic AH. You're pissy your blind sister's caregiver is going on the trip while your boyfriend isn't. Saying YTA is being generous.", "Info: are you spending a cent on this vacation? Or is this being completely covered by your mom and step dad?", "According to other comments she\u2019s blind, and you even call him more of a caregiver than a boyfriend. This is not the same as you wanting to have your significant other along for cuddles. YTA", "Really depends on the medical condition. Some medical conditions really do warrant accommodations being made, even on family trips. Some don't. It depends on that.\n\nIf it really is medically related, and the only reason you're backing out is to spite everyone because you think they're being unfair to you, that would be an AH move for sure.", "You are of course not required to go on this trip, but you are definitely being an asshole about it if you cannot see that you bringing your boyfriend for fun is in NO way the same as your blind sister in law bringing her boyfriend because, as you\u2019ve admitted, no one else in your family wants to bother with giving her the accommodations that she needs", "Now knowing that your stepsister is blind, yes, YTA. It sounds like her bf is the only one out of this group that is familiar with her day to day needs and will be able to help her the way she needs. \n\nYour insistence that this isn\u2019t fair to YOU really comes off as immature and selfish.", "YTA she's blind, not faking some condition to get attention.  You sound jealous, cruel, and unempathetic. Try harder, do better. Don't be such a selfish and entitled asshole. \ud83d\ude44", "In all good conscience how did you manage to write this without realizing YTA? She's fucking blind FFS", "Question: if your sister required a seeing eye dog, would you have insisted it was unfair that she have her own personal dog and insist that you HAD to have a dog too?\n\nYou *cannot* equate something she REQUIRES to navigate the world with something that you just kind of want to have. If your family has said they will not provide her the assistance she needs to participate in the vacation, then she *needs* her boyfriend there.

Like cohabitation, maybe future husband? Or is this a fairly new relationship?

So the girl is blind and NONE of you want to help her but rather focus on doing the touristy crap. I'm surprised you guys want to invite her at all! \n\nNo wonder the only other person (apart from her biomom) she feels comfortable receiving help from is her bf. Her own dad doesn't give a flying fuck and the rest of you ain't better. \n\nMy lord.", "1. You are free to back out. Family vacations aren't mandatory.\n2. Your reason for doing so is why YTA. \n3. Your blind stepsister is being permitted to bring her bf so he can act as her **caregiver,** to do work no one else in your family wants to do. His presence will be doing all of  **you** a favor.\n4. You are weaponizing your stepsister's special needs to manipulate the family into allowing you to bring your boyfriend, just for fun. That's intellectually dishonest.", "YTA\n\nNo one is \"changing the rules\" for the trip. They're allowing your **blind** stepsister to bring her boyfriend for support/assistance. Annie has a valid need for her boyfriend to be there. You want yours to come with just because.", "When you say this isn\u2019t fair, do you mean that it\u2019s not fair that Annie has a medical condition that interferes with her independence & requires assistance from others but you\u2019re healthy and can take care of yourself?

Do you think it\u2019s \u201chypocritical\u201d that people who can\u2019t walk can hang a placard in their car & get to park closer to buildings than you do? YTA. Your step sister has a disability, and you\u2019re mad that she gets an accommodation that you don\u2019t.", "YTA\n\nI would say YTA anyway going off the post because she has a valid reason to have her boyfriend with her. Your step dad, her bio dad can't be bothered assisting his own daughter for a little bit. This sealed the deal:\n\n*She's blind. She's a bit jumpy around strangers, (we're obviously not strangers,) but we don't really want to have to take her around, explain things to her and so on when we're doing all the tourist-y things. Her boyfriend apparently understands her the best so parents are allowing him to come.*\n\nI don't think it's just because \"he understands her the best\". I think it's because he's the only one who gives a flying fuck about Annie. The rest of you run for the hills if you're the slightest bit inconvenienced. \n\nHonestly I respect your parents more than you because at least they admit they don't care for assisting/accommodating her and allowing her to bring someone who does care. \n\nThey offered an option for their own carelessness. You don't want to admit yours and is stuck on \"she gets to bring her boyfriend but I don't!!! how unfair!!\"\n\nIf you're willing to support Annie I'm sure they'll say no to the boyfriend? I'm guessing you won't be onboard with that though", "YTA and actually your whole family sucks with the exception of your step sister and her boyfriend.\n\nConsidering you are all too selfish and ableist to enjoy a vacation with your blind stepsister, the least they can do is let someone who isn't an asshole come along so she too gets to experience being a tourist. The fact that you are throwing a tantrum over what is really a shitty second to your family vacation speaks volumes about your character.\n\nI'm so angry for your stepsister, her whole family treats her like a nusince. I hope her and her boyfriend enjoy the trip, fuck the rest of you.", "So, OP, you tell us your step sister is blind, and that neither you nor your family is willing to help her while on vacation. And then you also tell us that you think her boyfriend is with her out of pitty and that he\u2019s more of a caregiver, which is something really shitty of you to say because basically what you mean is that your stepsister is not worthy of love. Now, let\u2019s for a mere second indulge you and that he is in fact her caregiver than in this case according to your own judgement his presence is not only justified but necessary. \n\nYTA, but by all means if this is the attitude you\u2019d be taking with you please dont go on the trip, your stepsis shouldnt have to put up with it.", "YTA, how is bringing your bf for fun the same as her bringing her bf for support. The only reason she has to, is because you cannot be bothered to give her the support she needs. She is going to a strange country, with different rules for the blind and has to figure out a lot of stuff you don't even have to think about. \n\nGet over yourself, go or don't go on that holiday, it is up to you, but your current reason is total BS and therefore - I cannot say this enough - YTA!", "NTA - you\u2019re an adult, and it\u2019s your vacation too. If they\u2019re going to decide who comes and who doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re welcome to decide you don\u2019t want to go.\n\nThe only exception to this would be if you expected them to pay for your BF", "You're a legal adult. You're not obligated to go on any vacation you don't want to go on. If you don't like the terms your parents have set, don't go. They are allowed to set terms if they are paying or organizing.\n\nNAH", "Yes yta because it sounds like he takes care of her.", "YTA.  Also you are petty and hateful.  Not for wanting to skip the vacation, but for how spoiled and shitty you are about your step-sis.", "NTA \n\nBut,not to shove my beak in, what sort of 'medical condition' are we talking here \n\nBecause it almost sounds like the parents and steps cba doing care roles so decided to let the bf come along to do it", "NTA. You're an adult so nobody can force you to go on the vacation. It sounds like Annie's BF is coming for care giving purposes, and otherwise would not have been included. I don't think your parents are trying to give her preferential treatment or anything, it's just about her condition and having someone there to help her.", "YTA. Stay home; the trip will be more enjoyable for everyone else.  She\u2019s blind and he\u2019d be her caregiver since no one else wants to do it.  He\u2019s going for basically everyone else\u2019s comfort.", "YTA.", "As things stand I would say NTA.\n\nYou clearly discussed your perspective with your parents, and when you couldn't come to a compromise you backed out of the trip, which is very much your right.\n\nOne bit of information which isn't in the post is how much it would cost to bring your BF to Canada with you, and who would be paying for that. Could it be that the added cost is what is making your parents object?", "NTA, tell you mom you will feel like odd one out.   Is stepdad paying, is that the issue", "YTA.", "YTA- Wow\u2026supported your decision and all until you say that she is blind and basically her bf is going because the rest of you refuse to be stuck helping her during this trip.  You don\u2019t have to go as you are an adult, but your reasoning makes you an AH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
