The fact that you are throwing a tantrum over what is really a shitty second to your family vacation speaks volumes about your character.\n\nI'm so angry for your stepsister, her whole family treats her like a nusince.

Not for wanting to skip the vacation, but for how spoiled and shitty you are about your step-sis.", "NTA \n\nBut,not to shove my beak in, what sort of 'medical condition' are we talking here \n\nBecause it almost sounds like the parents and steps cba doing care roles so decided to let the bf come along to do it", "NTA.

I don't think your parents are trying to give her preferential treatment or anything, it's just about her condition and having someone there to help her.", "YTA. Stay home; the trip will be more enjoyable for everyone else.  She\u2019s blind and he\u2019d be her caregiver since no one else wants to do it.

Wonder why.\n\nYTA.", "Annie is surrounded by assholes. \n\nImagine a father not wanting to assist his blind daughter on a family trip.\n\nYou being an AH (YTA btw) can possibly be put down to your age, at least in part, but it would seem your stepfather is an irredeemable prick.\n\nPlease pay your soul some attention", "YTA. Annie has a disability and wants to bring her support person so she can participate fully in the vacation. How is this difficult to understand?", "ESH she gets her boyfriend you do too, disability\u2019s or not.", "At first until I read the context I was gonna say NTA. But after finding the context that Annie's blind and no one wants to help her. Y'all are some selfish MFers. Especially OP and Annie's father. YTA", "YTA. She is blind and needs help. Her boyfriend will help her so everyone else can enjoy the vacation. One vacation without a boyfriend not as bad as someone being blind.", " YTA", "Yta sis . Why are you so mad that your parents have made arrangements to accommodate your sisters disability ? \nBreak your leg and then you boyfriend can come carry you around I guess", "YTA\n\nOP:\n\n>step dad says he doesn't think he can spend the time with Annie if she needs assistance.\n\n>She's blind. She's a bit jumpy around strangers, (we're obviously not strangers,) but we don't really want to have to take her around, explain things to her and so on when we're doing all the tourist-y things. Her boyfriend apparently understands her the best so parents are allowing him to come.\n\nSo none of you family is really willing to support your blind sister during vacation.

It's a family vacation and no one can be bothered to EXPLAIN what you're seeing??? \nWTH. You are all assholes except for her. The part about her bf being allowed to come doesn't even matter.

For real though, I want to.", "So your sister has an unsupportive family who treat her like a burden, whilst you assume people feel sorry for her, yet you\u2019re the one who feels badly treated here?

Op is a major asshole thinking that her blind stepsister shouldn\u2019t have someone that is actually kind to her to help her when she is in need. Plus 5 years is very long term. I\u2019m unsure if the parents are as assholey as op says they are since the whole post comes off as someone super jealous so everything she said about other people shouldn\u2019t be taken too serious.

Annie's boyfriend is first and foremost her boyfriend. Not her seeing-eye dog. Annie's boyfriend is also helping out with her disability. And much closer to Annie than your boyfriend is to you.

He is a really handsome, kind and successful man and I think people look at me (disabled, having to take time off school and work to find a treatment that works) and think he could do better so he must be feel sorry for me. But fuck those people anyway I guess.", "He's probably an ableist AH ... but, my Dad had a terrible knees by the time I was 20 and could barely walk up and down a flight of stairs. He also has undiagnosed attention problems, and there's not a chance in the world he could concentrate long enough to describe anything to anyone. Being a traditional noncommunicative dude, he also can't deal with admitting his own limitations / inability to help (he almost had a heart attack helping me move into a 4th story college dorm with no elevator).

You can't use being blind as an excuse to let her get her own way. My friends grand-daughter is 16, and she doesn't have a certain person as a caregiver. Once she gets the lay of the land, she's off and running! Even outside. My MIL is blind. No one helps her around. She even goes for walks on her own. Nope, I don't blame you for backing out.", "NTA but now you now ho your parents love more", "OK I have to not agree with the others here completely. You're NTA for not joining a family vacation, whatever the reason is. You don't own your mum or anyone to go if you don't want to.\n\nYou're TA though for not acknowledging that the rules were bent for your BLIND step-sister because she needs assistance and not even her own father seems to want to help her. So what is she supposed to do? Just sit at the table hoping anyone will have time and want to help if she needs it? It's a completely different situation than \"yeah I want my bf there just because...\" and the other (step) siblings haven't been allowed to bring bf or gf either, yes? So it would have been the normal reaction to just not make such a drama about it. Sounds like you have more bad feelings towards Annie than you want to admit... if so you need to acknowledge it and talk it out with your mum or anyone else invloved (if it isn't bad enough to go low or no contact) instead of finding reason to be pissed at Annie for being disabled and needing more support than you.", "ESH I think it's important to understand BOTH sides can be right in a situation... Yes youre right it's unfair that Annie is allowed to bring her boyfriend, caregiver or not there is plenty of other options such as caregivers who travel with you that insurance will pay for or only ask for $20 a day maximum...I think it's 100% unfair to allow one boyfriend to attend but not the other, but I also understand it's not their job to appease your feelings. You also need to keep in mind a few things it's not everyones job to arrange a new caregiver, get that caregiver and your sister use to working with each other, and to pay extra for a caregiver when her boyfriend is happily willing and able. \n\nNext, as a kid who comes from a family with money who invites partners or friends with us I doubt youre paying for anything about the trip. I'll go a step further I think youre actually expecting this boyfriend of yours to get a free vacation if you bother your family enough about it... \n\nLastly, the choice to not go to the vacation affects NO ONE besides yourself. You're a grown adult being offered a free vacation with your family. You need to understand that the world does not revolve around you... and your grown adult family members will not bend over backwards to appease your feelings...", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are right, your mom and stepdad are AH.
