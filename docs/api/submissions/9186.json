It sounds like her bf is the only one out of this group that is familiar with her day to day needs and will be able to help her the way she needs. \n\nYour insistence that this isn\u2019t fair to YOU really comes off as immature and selfish.", "YTA she's blind, not faking some condition to get attention.

The fact that you are throwing a tantrum over what is really a shitty second to your family vacation speaks volumes about your character.\n\nI'm so angry for your stepsister, her whole family treats her like a nusince.

Not for wanting to skip the vacation, but for how spoiled and shitty you are about your step-sis.", "NTA \n\nBut,not to shove my beak in, what sort of 'medical condition' are we talking here \n\nBecause it almost sounds like the parents and steps cba doing care roles so decided to let the bf come along to do it", "NTA. You're an adult so nobody can force you to go on the vacation. It sounds like Annie's BF is coming for care giving purposes, and otherwise would not have been included.

I recently went to an event with them and was really impressed by everything that he does for her and the care he takes. When we couldn\u2019t park right near the entrance and had to be shuttled down from an upper lot, he tenderly lifted her out of her chair and into the shuttle. My sweet cousin was the boyfriend that I was picturing as you wrote.

I say your parents don't want the responsibility on vacation and so the bf is able to vacation with the family.  Your sis doesn't want to be a burden and that's why she wants the bf with her.
