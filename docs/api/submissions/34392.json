His job is very dubious at best. That is very difficult to put in a resume. He should either look for a different job or just stop working for a while. Take a degree or pivot to a new course that is very promising.", "This explains why there are so many India-centric posts on popular subreddits. It's an organised strategy.", "NTA in your case.\n\nPeople require occupational satisfaction - be it a job, hobby, etc - so for some people just being told \"don't do anything and rely only on me\" is a nightmare. This has nothing to do with gender and entirely to do with personal drive. However, asking him to quit a toxic, unsatisfying job so that he can focus his time on looking for a new job or occupation is a perfectly fair way to have phrased it. So for you, NTA, as I believe it is all coming from a good place.\n\nHusband, however, is coming across as a massive AH:\n\ni) Sexist views on relationships and income, and not willing to move out of a toxic job with your support to find more work.\n\nii) Racist views in relation to immigration and politics,\n\niii) Happy to engage with spreading what he knows as disinformation in order to further bigoted causes.", "Oh jesus, he's an actual propoganda bot?\n\nYeah, no obviously quit that\n\nUmmm, but yeah he has a point. Depending on someone like you're their pet is very demeaning for a man at least. People (but especially men) need to feel useful to be happy. Provide, work.

His job sounds horrible and he should leave it IMO, but he\u2019s clearly been struggling and doesn\u2019t want to be your dependent. That\u2019s a good thing! He wants to feel that he\u2019s contributing, that he\u2019s a provider and not a burden. Maybe he\u2019s feeling some cultural or family pressure, too? Your ability to pay for things for him probably just makes him feel worse. That he has a diploma instead of a degree suggests he didn\u2019t have the money or the academic success for university, which also probably makes him feel insecure.\n\nQuestion: you say \u201cI hope to emigrate to either the US or Canada in the coming years,\u201d rather than \u201cwe hope:\u201d are you planning to go alone? Taken altogether, if I were your husband I might doubt your respect for me and commitment to the marriage.\n\nQuestion 2: you two are in somewhat related fields, so is there anything you could do to help him with his job search?", "NTA.

There were whole businesses devoted to making up false or false-with-a-tiny-grain-of-truth news stories and making them look like real reporting.)

I don't know what the marriage laws are in your country, but if he's feeling insecure about not working, there's probably a conversation that needs to be had about the relationship dynamics themselves. It's not about just the money or the job. Trust me, he doesn't want to be sitting in a call center making bullshit calls when he's a fully educated mechanical engineer. There's more at play here. I hope you find the advice you need to have a real conversation with your husband about his relationship needs. Clearly the material and financial needs are being met.

It bothered me and while I don\u2019t think she meant to criticize me over it, this did come up frequently and was a source of friction in our relationship.\n\nI still paid half of rent and all expenses, however she was frustrated that we were limited to what I could afford. And she felt like the man in a relationship should make at least the same but ideally more than the women (yes a bit old fashioned, but I think this was the influence of her family). \n\nAnyways, I focused on working really hard and getting a job in a profession with lots of upward mobility and 10 years later I\u2019m now earning 25x more than I was when we got married. She doesn\u2019t even work anymore and is a stay at home mom to our 3 kids. \n\nI did work an insane and inhumane amount over those 10 years but at least money is not something we have to worry about anymore.", "NTA, especially not for asking. He clearly has some insecurity with his misogyny. I really hope he\u2019s just expressing himself wrongly and just wants a job to tie some self worth too. I understand wanting to be able to contribute to your home. \n\nBut him going on about he\u2019s a man and he has to be a provider is just wrong. It\u2019s certainly ok with him still have a job, but idk why it\u2019s an issue that you out-earn him.

But he can probably find something part-time or freelance just to stay in the market while doing whatever thing he pursues. \n\nI presume you love and care about him a lot, but I have to ask what he brings to the table besides being sour, miserable, and resentful. He cannot allow himself to enjoy his life because other people judge him\u2014that\u2019s an exhausting person to live with for the next 50 years.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to sit down, and tell him, \u201cI refuse to be with someone who\u2019s miserable.

We get it your a hard working tech woman with a great job and successful career, while your husband only had a diploma, is unemployed, and he can only get jobs that you feel are below you.

There is a certain pride he's trying to reclaim as the top earner or substantial earner in the household. Many men do feel lesser if their spouse makes more than them or if they have to depend on them financially. While I can understand this, there is no shame in taking a break if things keep failing. Maybe he can consider a different career path, or maybe search for alternative resources on how to reach his goal.

Why take away what sense of independence he actually has? Do you have children? If not I wouldn\u2019t be doing that. Yes, continue to encourage him to get a better job, but to go jobless is awful.

I\u2019m a finance senior executive,and he often says my job is equivalent to being a secretary, he was an engineer an has no respect for any profession beyond doctors and engineers. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the tangent, my point is my wife is not some kind of slave driver taking advantage of me. I had plenty of my own baggage and made my own decisions. It was not pleasant when I was reminded constantly of the fact I was making less than her early in our marriage but the result was that it motivated me and we are both happy with our lives now. Maybe the path was not ideal but the destination has been great", "[deleted]", "Wow, your privilege is disgusting. Must be nice to be able to pick and choose a job when you\u2019ve been unemployed for months and struggling. Do you think every person likes their work, the people, or the environment they work in? It\u2019s a fucking JOB, not a lifestyle.", "He's literally spreading propaganda against himself. Fairly sure this is just about work.", "Nah, she's not making any decisions for him, she's asking him to do something, the decisions is his to make. And what he's doing is unquestionably immoral, so basically she's asking him not to do a bad thing, and you think she's ta for doing so", "The thing is, the husband isn\u2019t forced into that work with the risk of starvation/homelessness hanging over his head. He\u2019s doing it because spreading harmful and cruel disinformation is, in his mind, not as bad as him feeling kinda weird about his wife being the breadwinner. \n\nI have empathy for people who do fucked-up jobs out of desperation or ignorance. But this man is neither of those things. \n\nPersonally, I doubt he agrees with the garbage he\u2019s posting. But he\u2019s apathetic to it, and to some extent, silence is a form of agreement.", "So you would promote racism to get money? I wonder what else you would sell yourself for just for a paycheck.", "But that isn't the case, they're not struggling, the whole conflict is because the wife wants him to leave that job BECAUSE they can afford it. \n\nOP's husband HAS the privilege to and choose, in the sense that he does not need to be working right now.", "But like...even if you must have a shit job, there are shit jobs that aren't literal racist propaganda mills.", "Honestly yes I do! First off, school is HARD for a lot of people and her saying to him \u201cOh, just go back and get another degree\u201d as if it\u2019s easy is privilege beyond belief! She obviously was good at school if she thinks it\u2019s that easy. Many people aren\u2019t. Maybe he\u2019s one of those people who struggled and was proud of himself to earn the diploma he has! \n\nAnd telling him to just up and quick his job is NOT OK! Everything that she and you said in your comment is easy to say when you\u2019ve have THREE great jobs one after the other and HAVEN\u2019T been unemployed for months watching your spouse thrive in their career! He finally had a job. Not a great, but it\u2019s A JOB! A job that allows him to earn his own income and she could at least let him enjoy THAT for a while and stop with the holier than thou attitude.", "NTA. your man got suckered into a fake idea of masculinity and is immature and unwilling to do hard work. his story is not unique and that is a tough person to deal with, good luck to you\n\ni am so ready to ditch working if my partner ends up finding a job that can support fam (i\u2019m also a software engineer. i have 0 desire to build things for other people anymore but it\u2019s a good and easy paycheck)", "NTA I'm even willing to accept that he needs to have a job not to feel emasculated, because the patriarchy is strong, but his \"job\" is creating international strife and making life harder for his countrymen abroad.

Not supporting yourself can make you feel like shit.  I imagine it's much harder for many men who have to deal with gendered expectations, especially in a patriarchal country.  You need to be a little more understanding about why your husband feels he needs a job.  It's about self-respect and not wanting to be a mooch.  That's a good thing.   At the same time, your husband is actively harming people with his job, which makes him suck.  But at the same same time, sometimes you do what you have to do.   I'm not sure how it would effect immigration issues though, maybe talk to an immigration lawyer and get some info.   All that being said, the fact your husband is too lazy to go back to school and do some self improvement so he doesn't have to try to destroy society through social media is... less than appealing.", "A lot of men can\u2019t handle their wife making more (or is the sole breadwinner) than them. I don\u2019t get it in the slightest. But it\u2019s tied deeply to their ego that they need to be the main provider. If my wife earned more than I did, I would love that. But the same thing applies to the woman who earns more as a man who earns more, if you lord it over the spouse then that would make you an asshole. If you try to prevent them from having hobbies or extracurricular activities and say something like \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend MY money on that\u201d, that would make you the asshole.", "Hard to say.

Nobody else wondering that?", "People are taking your side simply because of what he was doing.  This is 2 different things.\n\nIs it okay for you to ask him to quit that piece of shit job?  Absolutely.  Hell, that's so terrible it would be okay if you demanded it.\n\nBut asking him to just stop working?  If the genders were reversed, you'd get shit all over.", "I absolutely get how he feels, but his job is *bullshit*. I loathe paid trolls like him, so you're in the right to tell him to get a real job. NTA", "NAH. I understand how you both feel.\n\nJust an FYI, his employment won\u2019t negatively impact immigrant to the US in any way, so don\u2019t worry about that.\n\nI am empathetic to him being defensive about wanting to at least have a job and be productive rather than just feeling like a valueless dependent. That comes from a good place. He can keep working the job he has if he wants or do whatever else.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a diploma and a degree? In the US, a diploma is just what one would call the physical paper that represents the degree.", "Nta.\n\n He should however absolutely stop working at jobs and keep trying to further his career.\n I understand his feelings of not wanting to rely on you, but what he's doing for work is pretty problematic and I'm surprised he doesn't feel shame for doing that type of work. He is literally just helping spill negativity out into the world.", "NTA-as a Canadian living in a city with two universities and a college (one that has been heavily accepting international students) I feel like we are your husbands target audience. The amount of hate spewing on social media (Reddit especially) against Indians and other immigrants on the local subs lately has been awful.  It is making the lives of minorities unsafe and ruining our multicultural society.  To know that he is out there actively propagating it is disgusting.  He may think that being jobless is demeaning or emasculating but it is 100% better then having no integrity. I hope if you choose to come to Canada you will find the acceptance and respect you deserve instead of the hostility your husband is helping to create.", ">I don't understand how he feels like a man earning less and not providing and this will make it worse.\n\nHe's so brainwashed. I'd take my SO's offer in a heartbeat if she proposed this to me.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "Exactly. Does he realize how the full scope of what he does riles up our right-wing nutters and makes it hard for them to emigrate to the countries they *want* to emigrate to?

He's not doing it for survival.\n\nHere in the United States, those posts are a HUGE, HUGE fucking problem.  They cause chaos and violence, even within and provoked by our own government.  They're a big part of the reason that abortion rights have been restricted and gay & trans rights are again in danger.\n\nHow can you respect someone who's making an active choice, every day, to do that to other people's society?", "Would be an immediate deal breaker for me.  He's fully comfortable spreading racist propaganda, he's a bigot.", "To me it depends on HOW it's being asked. If OP asks something like \"How would you feel staying home and taking care of the domestic side of our partnership?\" and stresses that it's not an expectation but would help support their lives overall, I don't think it's insulting. Especially if the husband's current job is ethically questionable. \n\nObviously husband has made it clear how he would feel staying at home and that should be respected at this point. I would suggest some of his perceptions on \"being a man\" are antiquated and could use some reevaluation. It's quite easy to \"be a man\" and covering the majority of domestic work IS supporting the family.", "I have to admit, as a Canadian, I would not be very happy to hear that your husband might be moving here...

Where is this place exactly?", "Sure Jan", "I genuinely understand and empathize that he\u2019s probably being put under enormous pressure by friends/family.

Instead he gets a job shitting all over his countrymen and his wife\u2019s chances at immigration.

If you do a job that's morally reprehensible; the people in your life have every right to begin to think less of you for it. Selling your soul for a pay cheque isn't any better then selling your body for a pay cheque. Its one thing if you *have* to do it- but when you choose to do it when other options are available to you, then you're just..either ugly on the inside; or terribly unmotivated, you know?\n\nI would have difficulty feeling respect or sexual attraction to my husband if he revealed himself to be that morally compromised and acquiescent to never achieving anything- not even basic respectability."]}
