Traditions are cool and all but they fade when family members are introduced or lost over time.  The things we did when I was younger were nice but when my wife and I married, we started on own traditions.  The prior ones are fond memories now.  \n\nIt was your wedding and your dress.  If your husband was so feverish about it, he should have worn a blush dress.", "Do you still have time to annul this marriage?", "NTA. If anything, your husband is the biggest asshole here.

Good luck with that shiz!", "NTA. Your husband and MIL were totally jerks.

I seriously doubt my husband knows blush is even a color.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. But be wary of a man who says he was disappointed about your dress color as you walked down the aisle to marry him. the only appropriate feeling when you are about to marry the love of your life is joy and excitement. If the color of your dress can distract your groom as he sees you walking down the aisle then his priorities are all wrong. You're his wife and he should be supporting you here, not his overbearing mother.", " NTA this is some bullshit. I mean yeah you could have told them in advance but would they really have been ok with it, or would they have just started bitching sooner and tried to get you to change it or even sabotage the dress? I\u2019ve seen worse on Reddit. \n\nI wore black bc it\u2019s an old Spanish tradition, part of my heritage I wanted to honor, and I don\u2019t love big white gowns, and I told our families ahead of time that it would be black. I didn\u2019t ask. My dad wasn\u2019t happy because he didn\u2019t get it, but he ended up not being at my wedding anyway for a bunch of other reasons so  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af  the black went over very well though and our priest worked the tradition into his homily so everyone understood by the end of the ceremony. \n\nI did wear 2 white dresses for the reception and one for the rehearsal the night before so people still got their \u201cwhite dress moment\u201d from me but tbh if my husband had given me shit for wearing black bc his mommy didn\u2019t like it, it would have been a HUGE red flag. It\u2019s YOUR WEDDING not MILs.

Good luck.", "NTA. First of all, you are not part of that tradition as you are not a woman in their family.

It\u2019s so weird to me. And if your husband really wanted you to wear blush, he should have been clear about that. I was so excited for my husband to see me in my wedding gown. I can\u2019t imagine how hurt I would have been if he had been disappointed. I am really sorry that happened to you. I am sure your dress was beautiful!\n\nEdit: to be clear, she did not have to wear blush, but if he felt really strongly, he should have said so ahead of time.", "NTA get that marriage annulled. Your new husband was really disappointed when he saw you? That\u2019s pathetic of him.", "NTA. She's got an awful lot of nerve and sounds like a nightmare of an MIL", "NTA but you have made a massive mistake marrying into this family. These people decided for you that you would give up your dream dress on your wedding day because of their tradition. If my partner told me they were disappointed when they saw me on our wedding day, I would not be spending another day with them.", "NTA, but how on earth did you marry a man who felt strong enough to be disappointed about your dress choice, but apparently didn't actively communicate that to you during your wedding planning? Like, you wouldn't have been obligated either way, but if this was a big deal for him why was there no communication BEFORE you bought a dress? That's literally insane. \n\nMIL can go pound sand.", "NTA...Your day, your way. It's concerning that your husband didn't take your side on this. Some traditions are ridiculous.", "NTA. Why is it a tradition that they wear blush? I am just being nosy.", "Nta this one was easy lol. It\u2019s your wedding, your dress, let people be disappointed.

He was focused on the color of the dress. It shouldn't matter what you wore, just that you were there and marrying him. You could have worn a paper sack and he shouldn't care. He's marrying the person, not the outfit.\n\nThis is a marinara flag. You need to sit down with your husband and make it absolutely clear that his words hurt and your MiL's words hurt.

Did he tell you it was important to him?  Or did he only express it after the fact?", "So, this isn't about the dress.\n\nThis is about your husband's family having a tradition of a shared experience during a right of passage which symbolically joins you to the other women of the family. They were wanting to include you, so you'd become a part of their family. It's a bit like when you join a club and it doesn't quite feel \"official\" unless you go through the mini induction ceremony. To them, it was a way to honor you, welcome you, and show they felt you were worthy.\n\n By blowing it off, you basically declared you have no interest in being their family. Very publicly. And called their little tradition stupid. *That's* why they're upset with you. Both your MIL and new husband.\n\nYou also knew this was important to them and didn't say anything until the big reveal the day of. Which adds in a layer of you being sneaky and/ or a liar to get your way, which is going to taste bad.\n\nYou should have at least been honest that the bridal shop couldn't alter the color and done damage control beforehand. Like maybe offering to get a blush colored sash, jewelry, or bouquet or something, to at least show you're a willing team player who can compromise if they will.\n\nYou prioritized how you looked for a day over their feelings and acceptance.
