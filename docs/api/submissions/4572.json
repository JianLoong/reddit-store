I have an older sister (29) that they had when they were super young. Like I think my mom was 19 and my dad was 18. \n\nThey did not do a great job with her and she has a lot of problems.  She is chronically unemployed and she is a thief.  \n\nShe has two kids that are okay. They live with us as well because her boyfriend didn't want them around.  I like the kids but they are spoiled little brats my parents dote on to make up for being shitty parents to their mom.  \n\nMy parents won't let me put a lock on my door because it is their house and they don't want that.  No problem. I talked to the kids and explained about what would happen if they came into my room without permission. We have an understanding.  \n\nWell my sister broke up with her boyfriend and she needed a place to stay. I begged my parents not to let her stay with us.  They declined. So I begged again for a lock for my door. No dice. \n\nI have to go to school so I can't guard my stuff at all times.  When I came home on Friday I found my car absolutely trashed and the side of it destroyed.  \n\nMy sister had gone into my room, found my spare key and taken my car.  Then lost control on the ice after a day of eating crap and tossing fast food wrappers everywhere. She sideswiped a tree. \n\nWhen I saw my car I was livid.  I told my parents that I expected her to pay to fix it.  They said she didn't have any money. So I said that I would call my grandparents. They had helped me get the car and insurance.  \n\nAfter talking with my grandfather I came back to talk to my parents.  I said that the insurance would cover fixing or replacing my car depending on the damage. But that I would have to file a police report. And that my sister would probably be charged for stealing my car.  They begged me to tell insurance that she had permission.  I said nope. \n\nSo rather than go through insurance they are replacing my car. But they are using money that they had sett aside to take me and my nieces to Orlando next summer for my graduation.  It's fine. I can do without seeing Disney World again.  But my parents, sister, and nieces are upset with me and saying that I'm an asshole for denying my nieces the opportunity to go on a vacation that they have never had.  \n\nI just asked them if a lock for my door would have been cheaper.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670877760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkasxa/aita_for_making_my_parents_choose_between_my/", "score": 703, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not even going to get into the fact that the car was stolen, I'll just address the twisted logic of blaming you for not getting a vacation.\n\nRepairing your car is simply an expense that needs to be paid. There's no debate about that. It doesn't really matter what that money would've been used for, that part of the equation isn't your responsibility in any way.\n\nHere's another example to illustrate that point: if you had dental work done and the dentist sent you a bill, would you then blame that dentist for the misery and death of a young Bolivian child? Because before this expense occurred you were planning to make a charitable donation to UNICEF and now you can't afford it anymore? Of course not, it's not the dentist's responsibility to make sure you have extra money to donate. Accusing the dentist of that would just be a slimy use of emotional manipulation to get out of your financial obligation. And it wouldn't work because the logic of it is so stupid.", "NTA. \nI agree a lock would have been way less expensive.

It's their fault for enabling the 29 year old child, so they're going to pay for her \"mistakes\".

I hope they start saving up to celebrate ur graduation still at least. NTA", "NTA \n\nFirst off I love the last line. Second it sucks your parents are so bad at being parents despite the multiple chances they had.

Not only do they want to have their cake and eat it too, they want to be able to eat it twice. They don\u2019t get to fix your car AND avoid a charge for your sister AND have vacation.

In fact, you\u2019ve been overly kind by making sure your sister doesn\u2019t get in legal trouble, the only scenario in which she would actually consequences for her actions.

I have evidence. It was better than a lock in this case.", "Yup. And they're all wrong. Its not your fault that the vacation is no longer a possibility.

You don\u2019t the parents here wouldn\u2019t happily hand over the key to her?", "Tagging onto the top comment here. OP you can buy a lock box on Amazon for $50 or so to keep your valuables in. If you still have a year left before you can leave, you should invest in one.\n You can keep the key on you at all timess and hopefully it would prevent this from happening again. \n\nGood luck!", "FWIW, Years ago, I was in my car and was rear-ended while my hazards were on. I saw the driver & passenger of the vehicle & got the plate after they took off. I filed the police report, because of insurance.\n\nThe police never followed up on my report & the driver had a long history of similar vehicular incidents (crashes & DUIs). There was a comment made that I should have filed some additional paperwork to press charges to the hit and run, but the police didn't explain anything when I filed my report.\n\nSo, the point of all this is you might very well file the police report - and nothing could happen to your sister. Depends on the police and DA. Often times, as it happened within the family, charges would not be filed where I live - YMMV.", "This, 100%.  NTA", "It's already there.

The insurance will have to pay for the work done in the car and increase OPs rates. \n\nBecause the sister stole her car (unauthorized use) OPs rates shouldn\u2019t go up as much, but the insurance company would need proof that OP isn\u2019t lying about the theft to get out of a major rate hike. Hence the police report. I think this also allows the insurance company to go after the sister.", "Usually when someone takes things without permission, it\u2019s considered theft.

As a thief, your AH sister could still pick the lock and take anything again.", "Back up those video files in a couple different places and in the cloud in case you ever end up making that police report.", "Go to the police anyway, even if they pay back she stole your car and ruined it. Your parents can't keep enabling her and she's old enough to be responsible for her actions. NTA but you will be if you don't report.", "Smart", "Honestly, it could be the best thing for her in the long run. Get therapy, a GED or just learn that being a lying entitled twit will get you pummeled in the cafeteria. It genuinely could be a positive for her going forward.

Good luck.", "Of course you do, but your parents ought to be noticing that she stole and wrecked your car and that is all on her.

Uggh, I hate humans.", "Then ide talk to your grandmother and ask her how you should deal with it. Her opinion is the only one that really matters.", "It\u2019s more than likely a location-based requirement because I thought it was totally standard for an insurance co to require a police report.", "You do. And it's easier now than when you eventually have to because the money is not actually coming.", "Umm , unless you\u2019re taking about some crazy nonstandard house lock, anyone with a credit card could break in.

You're talking about a doorknob that locks, but I'm pretty sure OP is talking about a deadbolt.\n\nAnd I guess you didn't have a very large safe? Or it wasn't affixed to anything.", "Honestly, I would. Your parents are enabling your sister at the expense of you and your niblings, but you don\u2019t need to enable them.", "Well yes, I\u2019m sorry as a 12 Yo child I didn\u2019t have a gun safe, and he snuck in through windows even when I had locks."]}
