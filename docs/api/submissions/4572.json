I have an older sister (29) that they had when they were super young. Like I think my mom was 19 and my dad was 18. \n\nThey did not do a great job with her and she has a lot of problems.  She is chronically unemployed and she is a thief.  \n\nShe has two kids that are okay. They live with us as well because her boyfriend didn't want them around.  I like the kids but they are spoiled little brats my parents dote on to make up for being shitty parents to their mom.  \n\nMy parents won't let me put a lock on my door because it is their house and they don't want that.  No problem. I talked to the kids and explained about what would happen if they came into my room without permission. We have an understanding.  \n\nWell my sister broke up with her boyfriend and she needed a place to stay. I begged my parents not to let her stay with us.  They declined. So I begged again for a lock for my door. No dice. \n\nI have to go to school so I can't guard my stuff at all times.  When I came home on Friday I found my car absolutely trashed and the side of it destroyed.  \n\nMy sister had gone into my room, found my spare key and taken my car.  Then lost control on the ice after a day of eating crap and tossing fast food wrappers everywhere. She sideswiped a tree. \n\nWhen I saw my car I was livid.  I told my parents that I expected her to pay to fix it.  They said she didn't have any money. So I said that I would call my grandparents. They had helped me get the car and insurance.  \n\nAfter talking with my grandfather I came back to talk to my parents.  I said that the insurance would cover fixing or replacing my car depending on the damage. But that I would have to file a police report. And that my sister would probably be charged for stealing my car.  They begged me to tell insurance that she had permission.  I said nope. \n\nSo rather than go through insurance they are replacing my car. But they are using money that they had sett aside to take me and my nieces to Orlando next summer for my graduation.  It's fine. I can do without seeing Disney World again.  But my parents, sister, and nieces are upset with me and saying that I'm an asshole for denying my nieces the opportunity to go on a vacation that they have never had.  \n\nI just asked them if a lock for my door would have been cheaper.  \n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT\n\nHey. I just got home from school.  There is a deadbolt on my bedroom door.  And my mom gave me a key.  She says that she is keeping the other one for emergency.  I agreed as long as it was only for emergencies.", "created_utc": 1670877760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkasxa/aita_for_making_my_parents_choose_between_my/", "score": 19554, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not even going to get into the fact that the car was stolen, I'll just address the twisted logic of blaming you for not getting a vacation.\n\nRepairing your car is simply an expense that needs to be paid. There's no debate about that. It doesn't really matter what that money would've been used for, that part of the equation isn't your responsibility in any way.\n\nHere's another example to illustrate that point: if you had dental work done and the dentist sent you a bill, would you then blame that dentist for the misery and death of a young Bolivian child? Because before this expense occurred you were planning to make a charitable donation to UNICEF and now you can't afford it anymore? Of course not, it's not the dentist's responsibility to make sure you have extra money to donate. Accusing the dentist of that would just be a slimy use of emotional manipulation to get out of your financial obligation. And it wouldn't work because the logic of it is so stupid.", "NTA. \nI agree a lock would have been way less expensive.

Then you\u2019d be able to show dash footage of your car out and about while you\u2019re at school", "At this point, her facing charges is your graduation present.", "Out of curiosity, who's paying for her medical bills? I hope it's your parents \ud83d\ude02", "Maybe get a second or third camera since they now know that one camera exists. That way if they go in and disable the camera, you still got 2 more they don't know about", "Expect the worst of people and then they won\u2019t disappoint haha", "I'm willing to bet that the car is registered and insured through your grandparents, not your parents, to ensure its your car alone. In my experience, in a unhealthy family setting, when extended family gifts you something, it becomes the family gift since you're all members of the same family. \nI was gifted the down payment for my first car from my mom's aunt, with the instructions of not letting my mom drive the car (she was afraid my mom would trick me into pawning it). My mom tried to convince me to borrow the car to drive to a casino, and I said no. Her argument was \"my aunt gave you the down payment\" My reply, \"call her and ask then, she says yes and I'll hand you the spare key.\" No phone calls were made. Mom drove her own car to gamble.", "Please tell them they used money from your trip! Your grandparents need to know that", "NTA, The actions of your (OP) sister have repercussions", "But they didn't report it stolen so sis didn't have to pay any consequences!", "They already have been abusive, it's obvious which child is significantly favored", "Ya know, there are good reasons posts concerning violence are against the rules here. It\u2019d be nice to leave it out of the comments too.", "Ours wasn't a belt but a switch - when my sister broke / hid it, she was told to go pick another one from the tree. Nothing like trying to work out what type would hurt less while picking it!", "Ah, I misunderstood what the person above you was saying. Yeah, you're right, OP doesn't want that on her driving record, especially since she's a young driver, even if the parents are willing to pay whatever increases come with it.", "Your grandparents are dead set rock stars.", "Why? OP isn't the registered owner, its loaned from grandma and was stolen whilst 'on loan' to OP. Surely Grandma is entitled to make the report?", "Criminal defense lawyer here.

Even if they have been in trouble dozens of times before and they know exactly what will happen.", "Eh but some people actually become institutionalized. They get out, can't get a job, and purposely try to go back because it's better than the struggle of being out, and they're used to prison. Just start committing random crimes to get locked up again", "They are punishing the little nieces, too, which is really horrible.", "I agree with you here. My husband is very security concious so all our doors are key locked. They have a setting where they're locked from outside but can be unlocked from inside. He always forgets to do this when he leaves and I have literally been locked inside my own house because I couldn't find my keys! I could smash a window in need but it freaks me out! Had a situation where the building across the road caught fire and I couldn't open the door to help them until I ran to the back of the house to find the keys to unlock the front door", "Nta. You didn't rob them of anything. Your sister did that. You're just not enabling her. You're right, a lock would've been cheaper.", "NTA. Your sister is the one that cost them their vacation, not you.", "NTA, you're right a lock would've been much cheaper.", "I don't understand how it is OPs fault when they didn't steal the car and crash it, the sister did.  Why isn't the sister getting the blame for ruining vacation?", "You may have a lock on that door now, but sounds like your sister will hunt down a key with ease. I recommend you get a Reolink camera for your room and a microsd card to keep recordings. You can get both for about $50 on Amazon. Install is super easy and then you\u2019ll have surveillance in your room as well. There is no monthly fee for this, just the one time purchase of equipment. \n\nNTA and I hope your car gets fixed. DO NOT allow someone else\u2019s horrible decisions and actions to make you feel responsible for them. They are responsible for how the act, not you. FAFO and her bad choices cost the family their vacation. I\u2019d be sure everyone knows why that remotely tries to blame you", "THIS^^^^ absolutely NOT the asshole. The girls mother denied them the right to go to Disney world when she STOLE YOUR CAR AND WRECKED IT! Their grandparents (your parents) denied them the right when they chose to allow your room to remain unlocked giving their eldest daughter access to your spare key in the first place. They need to let her suffer the consequences instead of bailing her ass out. NTA at all, OP.", "NTA.\n\nFile the Police report.", "I would also look into your freezing your credit.

I mean a parent at 18 and 31 are wildly different of course\u2026\n\nThey feel guilty and want to try to help her now. I feel bad for older sister tbh, I doubt she was given a fair chance at becoming a responsible adult.\n\nThat being said wtf can u do now\u2026", "My husband doesn\u2019t get undressed in front of me after work because his removing his belt still  makes me flinch. We\u2019ve been married 22 years. I wasn\u2019t even the one getting whooped, but it\u2019s still traumatizing.", "Not to mention, they don't seem to factor in things could've been WAY worse...what if sis hit another car and injured or even killed someone?", "The kids live with OP's parents cause her sister's boyfriend doesn't want them around = sister chose boyfriend over the kids.", "Just saying. There are 2 way bolt locks.", ">Oh yeah, well the jerk store called, they're running out of you!\n\nLMAO! I hate the way Reddit lays things out. I don't know WHO you were typing this awesome comment to, but I've decided I'm stealing it and using it forever!

But I meant, getting even worse and actively threatening OP's safety.", "Sorry you went through that. Yep, my parents didn't have the self control to undo a belt. Whatever was to hand at the time would do, thrust in the heat of the moment", "Or herself, since apparently she\u2019s the only person OP\u2019s parents give a fuck about :/ whatever op does with the spare key she should start taking the battery out and hiding it separately- personally I know where in my room I would put mine, but those batteries are thin enough that there are plenty of options, including taped to the underside of a door for maximum cheekiness"]}
