I have an older sister (29) that they had when they were super young. Like I think my mom was 19 and my dad was 18. \n\nThey did not do a great job with her and she has a lot of problems.  She is chronically unemployed and she is a thief.  \n\nShe has two kids that are okay. They live with us as well because her boyfriend didn't want them around.  I like the kids but they are spoiled little brats my parents dote on to make up for being shitty parents to their mom.  \n\nMy parents won't let me put a lock on my door because it is their house and they don't want that.  No problem. I talked to the kids and explained about what would happen if they came into my room without permission. We have an understanding.  \n\nWell my sister broke up with her boyfriend and she needed a place to stay. I begged my parents not to let her stay with us.  They declined. So I begged again for a lock for my door. No dice. \n\nI have to go to school so I can't guard my stuff at all times.  When I came home on Friday I found my car absolutely trashed and the side of it destroyed.  \n\nMy sister had gone into my room, found my spare key and taken my car.  Then lost control on the ice after a day of eating crap and tossing fast food wrappers everywhere. She sideswiped a tree. \n\nWhen I saw my car I was livid.  I told my parents that I expected her to pay to fix it.  They said she didn't have any money. So I said that I would call my grandparents. They had helped me get the car and insurance.  \n\nAfter talking with my grandfather I came back to talk to my parents.  I said that the insurance would cover fixing or replacing my car depending on the damage. But that I would have to file a police report. And that my sister would probably be charged for stealing my car.  They begged me to tell insurance that she had permission.  I said nope. \n\nSo rather than go through insurance they are replacing my car. But they are using money that they had sett aside to take me and my nieces to Orlando next summer for my graduation.  It's fine. I can do without seeing Disney World again.  But my parents, sister, and nieces are upset with me and saying that I'm an asshole for denying my nieces the opportunity to go on a vacation that they have never had.  \n\nI just asked them if a lock for my door would have been cheaper.  \n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT\n\nHey. I just got home from school.  There is a deadbolt on my bedroom door.  And my mom gave me a key.  She says that she is keeping the other one for emergency.  I agreed as long as it was only for emergencies.", "created_utc": 1670877760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkasxa/aita_for_making_my_parents_choose_between_my/", "score": 5533, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not even going to get into the fact that the car was stolen, I'll just address the twisted logic of blaming you for not getting a vacation.\n\nRepairing your car is simply an expense that needs to be paid. There's no debate about that. It doesn't really matter what that money would've been used for, that part of the equation isn't your responsibility in any way.\n\nHere's another example to illustrate that point: if you had dental work done and the dentist sent you a bill, would you then blame that dentist for the misery and death of a young Bolivian child? Because before this expense occurred you were planning to make a charitable donation to UNICEF and now you can't afford it anymore? Of course not, it's not the dentist's responsibility to make sure you have extra money to donate. Accusing the dentist of that would just be a slimy use of emotional manipulation to get out of your financial obligation. And it wouldn't work because the logic of it is so stupid.", "NTA. \nI agree a lock would have been way less expensive.

Keep all keys. If you get asked about it, ask what the emergency was that resulted in needing access to your room. When it's clear there is no such emergency, then question why they were needing access.
