As a cat parent, I can see why your neighbor  is jealous, but I think their jealousy is clouding their judgment on what's best for their cat. You aren't trying to steal the cat or lure them away. Your neighbor needs to realize cats are like teenagers. The more you try to stop them from doing something, the more they will do it.", "NTA. I actually think it would be wrong to scare the cat off.

In the same way people talk about kids, you know?\n\nIf the parent don't want you to play with their kid, then you better don't. And I was told the same thing about the cat.", ">You are being an asshole to the cat.\n\nUff ngl that hit me harder than saying I'm an A to my neighbour. May I ask why?\n\nBecause all I did when the cat was with me were just some basic precautions when dealing with a cat you don't have full control of. Cats are very sensitive to changes. Eventhough he's an outdoor cat, he still gets fed and is taken care of daily by his owner. I don't want to do anything that brings him out of his habit.\n\nAnd the time when I locked him out was when he got too curious of my singing but before we got close. Not everyone in our neighbourhood invited the cat in, so I thought it was okay. It would be cruel to do that now, since he'd really wait outside for hours.\n\nOr do you mean I'm an A for welcoming that cat in the first place?", "I\u2019ve got two cats and they do what they do , you don\u2019t choose cats they choose you I\u2019m in the uk btw", "Then that's it. It's an old cat with old habits, and the neighbour is wasting her time - and your time - on this non-issue.", "If a kid is entering your property than you can do whatever you want he is the one coming to you", "NTA at all and to say so is foolish.  The cat is aging, and enjoys your company for a bit while he rests.  Who are we to steal his peace?"]}
