She had told me before she got the dog that the dog would be my responsibility, of course I said yes not knowing the full extent of what that meant. So when she surprised me with a dog after a long day of school i was ecstatic, but when i looked around the house i couldn\u2019t find any food or bedding. When i asked my mother where the food or bed was she replied with \u201cthe dog is your responsibility which means you have to buy him the things he needs.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t have a job at the time and had practically no money, i could only buy him dog food and a couple blankets from a thrift store to make up for a bed. \n\nA few weeks after getting the dog I had got a job where I made minimum wage. I was barley making $150 a week with my mother constantly calling and telling me \u201c__ needs to go outside.\u201d, \u201c__ needs to go for a walk\u201d, or \u201c__ just had an accident, you need to come clean it.\u201d which forced me to leave work early most days. I spent all my earnings on buying things for the dog. Food, toys, beds, vet bills, medication, etc. Sometimes i even had to go to a local pantry to find dog food when i couldn\u2019t afford it because my mother refused to give me money for the dog.\n\nWhen i turned 16 i got a good paying job at a local restaurant and started saving up to move out.\n\nWith saying that, it takes us to now. A few weeks a ago i moved into my first apartment and took my dog with me. I moved out in the middle of the night with a backpack full of my belongings and a few bags full of my dogs things. The morning after i received a phone call from my mother that went like this, \u201cbring the dog back or i\u2019m calling the police\u201d\n\ni hung up on her and wasn\u2019t surprised when I got a call from the local sheriff asking me to meet him at the station. He asked me if what my mother was saying was true. I asked him what she was saying and found out she called the cops saying I broke into her house while she was at the store and stole her dog. I told the sheriff it wasn\u2019t true and explained what happened. I showed him receipts and card records of purchases that i made for the dog and showed him voicemails of my mother yelling at me to get home and take care of my dog.\n\nHe told me I had every right to keeps the dog since I had proof of \u201crightful ownership\u201d of my dog.\n\nWhen i got home i sent a text that read: \u201cFirst things first, I will be keeping __ in my house and under my care. And secondly, why is __ all of a sudden your dog? He wasn\u2019t your dog when when I had to buy him things on my own. He wasn\u2019t your dog when you would call me home from work to take care of him because he was \u201cmy responsibility\u201d. And he certainly wasn\u2019t your dog when you would call the cops and say i was starving my dog when i would ask you for money to buy him food.\u201d and with that i blocked her number.", "created_utc": 1695757410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sxrqx/aita_for_moving_out_and_taking_my_dog_with_me/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the very least she has some severe control issues. As someone with a narcissistic parent with poor boundary understanding, I get this and fully support the blocking. Is she someone who would show up unannounced at your new place and start making demands?", "NTA\n\nThis is a no-brainer. What kind of monster is your mom, though? You supported the dog, the cops believe you are the owner of the dog, the end. Your mom is over-the-top entitled and toxic. It was quite appropriate to block her.

I really resent it when members of the general public abuse law enforcement's time and resources by filing petty and, in this case, untrue claims.
