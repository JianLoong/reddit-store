Unfortunately, most of the advice about 'ignore it and it will go away' has clearly come from people who have never actually been bullied because it IS bollocks.\n\nINFO: what was the bullying about - a protected characteristic, or the usual hair/make-up/clothes? - (usual is not to be dismissive, I mean it happens A LOT). If the first, might be easier to get some traction on it, unfortunately, although any type of bullying is hurtful.\n\nHas anyone even tried discussing this with teachers/school counsellors?", "YTA\n\nYour advice is crap -- as you have very clearly seen, bullies don't stop if you ignore them.  Do you have \"WELCOME\" tattooed on your back?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd tell you what your friend SHOULD do, but that would just get me banned.  At least your friend has a spine.", "You should have involved school officials and parents. Do that this year the moment any bullying starts. Keep doing it as much as necessary. Have your phone out and record the bullies. Expose them.\n\nI\u2019m not going to say Y T A because you\u2019re a teen and growing and trying to find your way. But your friend\u2019s mental health and dignity are super important. Bullying always causes emotional damage and can lead to self harm and suicide. Make a big deal of it every time it happens.", "Americans have a sick view on life, wow. Or just School culture. No wonder there is so many school shooters", "NTA.  You and your friend need an adult ally.  Make a point of befriending someone in school authority (principal, vice principal, guidance counselor, resource officer).  Tell them your complete past history.  Name names, dates and specifics.  Do this before there is current drama.  Then equip you and friend for self protection.  Not with weapons.  Learn physical self protection.  Buy some protective clothing. (motorcycle jackets are a good start).  The hardest will be subjective/emotional/words protection.  Practice recording covert conversations.  If possible, record them being bullies and then name/shame.  Share with your trusted school authority person the first 'current' time.  After that, consider if social media is an option.  Shame the bully.", "YTA. I managed to get in 1 fist fight in every one of the three schools I went to growing up, but never had to fight the same bully twice.", "NTA.", "YTA. You should be having your friends back. Ignoring a bully doesn't work because they more often than not try harder when they have previously had a reaction. By trying to ignore the problem, you are saying that it's okay for them to bully.", "YTA - maybe support your friend more and defend yourself. Her standing up for herself didn\u2019t make it worse, that would have happened anyways. Standing up for yourselves, together, is the only way to get them to stop. You need a United front.", "NTA.  But the worst bullies in this situation are the school administration.  If they wanted to, they could stop it.  And you could trust them to stop, and you'd know to bring it up with them rather than here.  As it is, they are deliberately doing nothing: they are your enemy and your response is entirely rational.\n\nGet back at them when you have the chance.", "YTA\n\nIgnoring bullies doesn't make you better. It makes you prey.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, she just prefers to deal with it differently from what it sounds like", "YTA. Here's the thing...bullies often pick a target because a) they won't stand up for themselves and b) noone else will stand up for them. \n\nTelling someone to just ignore it is just such utter, utter crap. Being bullied is horrible and not something many of us could easily tolerate for a year. You're not to blame for her being bullied, but you do need to recognise that your way won't be the right way for everyone else.", "NTA I understand your advice and mindset but dude your about to graduate get in a good ole fashioned fist fight why not \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 5 years from now non of this is gonna matter and you probably aren\u2019t gonna be talking to anyone from your highschool I\u2019ve been graduated for 2 years and talk to no one and I\u2019m having the time of my life your in the driver seat pursue greatness", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You basically have a choice at this point: to put up with it for the rest of the year, whatever your friend does - in which case you might lose your friend - or suggest a means of dealing with it that doesn't let the bulies continue AND doesn't get you expelled. Which at this point probably means getting school authorities involved.\n\nI'm reserving judgment b/c it's just different strategies of dealing with things and obviously I'm not in your situation.\n\nWhatever you do, don't lower yourselves to the bullies' levels.", "No my friend get in a fist fight stand up for yourself and make a memory that will last a lifetime I promise you won\u2019t regret it taking a punch doesn\u2019t hurt that bad with all the adrenaline going it only hurts if you get hit multiple times in a row"]}
