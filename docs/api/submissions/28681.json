My next door neighbors (M & F, guessing 30s, son maybe 10) have a boxer who poops in my front yard all the time. Quite big poops (it\u2019s a boxer after all). He goes right where the delivery drivers walk to drop off packages. The poor drivers have even stepped in it before. I know it\u2019s their dog because of the ring doorbell cam. They just let him run loose, and I\u2019ve seen him in other neighbors\u2019 yards, too.\n\nAround 6 months ago, I knocked on the door while wife & son appeared to be home (car was there, could hear noises in house) and no one answered. A day or two later I tried again (again husband wasn\u2019t home), wife answered & I politely asked her to keep their dog from pooping in my yard. She said something like \u201cwe\u2019ll keep an eye on him.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t help. Dog continues to run free and poop all over my front yard. A couple times the husband has picked up poop while I\u2019m away (as seen on ring doorbell cam). That\u2019s a couple times in a probably 6 months (a lot of poop for a boxer).\n\nOnce a few months ago I bagged some up & put it right on their property line thinking they\u2019d get the hint. That didn\u2019t help. After lots more poop, I did it again last week.\n\nWhen I got home from work yesterday (around 6pm), husband was in his yard cleaning up poop. As soon as I stepped out of my car, he starts yelling at me. Saying sarcastic \u201cthanks for the bags of poop\u201d, saying I need to \u201cleave his wife alone,\u201d etc. He was being quite aggressive. The whole time the dogs are running loose (they have a 2nd smaller dog who is fairly new) & wife is calling them trying to get them to come back which doesn\u2019t help. Husband continues yelling. I told him if they\u2019d just listened when I asked them to stop letting their dog poop in my yard, we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. The final straw was him saying something along the lines of \u201cyou really went and fucked up for yourself now.\u201d I took this as a threat and called the cops.\n\nOfficer (F) arrived, questioned us both (separately). As she\u2019s talking to me (on the opposite side of the house from those neighbors), husband is still yelling. She then goes & talks to him. Officer returns & said the husband was intoxicated (again, at around 6pm), had just gotten back from being out of town & had a lot to deal with when he got home. Said the husband wants me to \u201cleave his wife alone\u201d (which is puzzling to me as I have only ever done the drive-by wave, and the one time I asked her to keep the dog from pooping in my yard). Officer tells me what husband said isn\u2019t \u201ctechnically\u201d a threat, but they\u2019d file a report. Said that if it continues they can cite them for the leash law. Told me to call if there\u2019s more trouble. I was afraid all last night and could barely sleep.\n\nFriends & coworkers seemed appalled at the situation and had my back. But I keep wondering if I am in the wrong here? First for bagging up & returning the poop, second for calling the cops after the altercation?

I would have just flung it back into their yard/driveway/ front porch. Once they get a couple of leash law citations or their dog is taken to the pound and they have to bail it out they will be more cooperative. Keep all the ring video of the dogs in your yard until this is resolved to your satisfaction.\nEdit to add NTA", "NTA.  You should start calling every time their dog poops in your yard.  It's more of a Humane Society thing than a police thing, at least in my neck of the woods.  This is incredibly rude.  You have been EXTREMELY patient about this.  You need to ramp up the defense of your property in my opinion.", "Nta\n\nFrom now on, don't bag it, just throw in a pair of rubber gloves, and throw it back into their lawn. \n\nThe police officer answered the question on if there's leash laws or not, meaning *they* were also informed of the leash laws. A couple visits from animal control might get them to start leashing their dogs, or only letting them out in their own backyard.", "NTA\n\nTime for the automatic sprinkler defense.", "NTA\n\nOk wow you need some self esteem here. You\u2019re clearly in the right and you might even research the concept of castle doctrine if he threatens you in your home again (not suggesting action, but so you recognize how seriously the kind of threats he is making are taken by law enforcement). \n\nAs an aside, I have heard that snowblowers make cleaning up dog poop fast and easy. And have the benefit of putting back where it belongs.", "NTA -  My neighbor's dog poops in my yard also, but at least they were not AH's when I told them about (happening a lot less now, but still once in a while, which sucks). I don't even put it in a bag, I just shovel it up and put it in a certain part of their property that they can see. Your neighbor's are terrible dog owners, and it appears the father may be an alcoholic (yeah, I'm jumping to conclusions, but the behavior was problematic).", "NTA. I say bag each pile of poo separately and proceed to use them as ammo in one of those homemade potato guns. Pick your target...", "NTA\n\nBut this is a perfect example of when I tell people \"Ask the owner to make it stop and if it doesn't immediately stop, report it\". Reason being, this is the first time the police were told about the loose dogs/ dogs shitting on your lawn. If you had reported it \"properly\", this likely would have been at the very least a 2nd interaction (for the cops) with the neighbor. Most police depts won't put up with that kind of shit (pun intended) after a third time. \n\nIf that were me, I would have cited them for the leash law right off the bat. It's people like this neighbor that make other dog owners look bad. Not only that, it's unsafe for every single person in that neighborhood (dogs have been known to randomly attack). Third, it's unsafe for the dog(s). I could easily see these dog owners \"going after\" some poor driver who hit their dog cause it ran out in the road.", "You should pull a Billy Madison. Burn the dog shit on the front porch", "Lol, I am so torn on this because I have done the exact same thing. But yeah, it's an ahole thing to do.
