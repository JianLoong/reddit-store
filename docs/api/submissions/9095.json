I asked her what I should get her daughter and she said that I should get a karaoke machine. But a few days later when I was hanging out with my younger sister who is around the same age as my friends daughter I told her about that karaoke machine and she basically laughed at me and said that no one actually wants that and she said I should just message her on IG and ask her what she wants instead of getting something she's gonna hate or not use. So that's what I did. She ended up sending me some links to some clothes and bags she liked and said that I should just choose one. They were all fairly expensive ones so I just chose the cheapest bag on her list which was still over 300 Euros (320 dollars for the Americans). \n\nSaturday comes and I end up giving her the bag and my friend saw that I didn't get the gift she told me to and asked me about it. So I explained everything and she was very upset with me saying that I shouldn't have messaged her daughter and that I should have just gotten the karaoke machine. We had a small argument and even her daughter told her that she never wanted a karaoke machine but my friend still insisted I was a \"jerk\" for going behind her back. She didn't talk to me at all throughout the party and even now a week later she constantly brings it up. So was AITA?\n\nEDIT: a few people have misunderstood our relationship, we're not just coworkers. We've known each other for 7 years and we're good friends outside of work too.\n\nEDIT 2: I've already mentioned this in one of my comments but I still get this question so yes I'm a man", "created_utc": 1675506890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tddte/aita_for_getting_a_15yr_old_a_gift_she_wanted/", "score": 5876, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
