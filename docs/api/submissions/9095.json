I asked her what I should get her daughter and she said that I should get a karaoke machine. But a few days later when I was hanging out with my younger sister who is around the same age as my friends daughter I told her about that karaoke machine and she basically laughed at me and said that no one actually wants that and she said I should just message her on IG and ask her what she wants instead of getting something she's gonna hate or not use. So that's what I did. She ended up sending me some links to some clothes and bags she liked and said that I should just choose one. They were all fairly expensive ones so I just chose the cheapest bag on her list which was still over 300 Euros (320 dollars for the Americans). \n\nSaturday comes and I end up giving her the bag and my friend saw that I didn't get the gift she told me to and asked me about it. So I explained everything and she was very upset with me saying that I shouldn't have messaged her daughter and that I should have just gotten the karaoke machine. We had a small argument and even her daughter told her that she never wanted a karaoke machine but my friend still insisted I was a \"jerk\" for going behind her back. She didn't talk to me at all throughout the party and even now a week later she constantly brings it up. So was AITA?\n\nEDIT: a few people have misunderstood our relationship, we're not just coworkers.

If the mom had a problem with a grown man being around her daughter she wouldn't have asked him to get her a gift.", "why?", "He knows the girl like seven years. Sorry, but i don't scream danger just because somebody ask for a birthday wish.", "If it's family friend and on level to be invited to her birthday and saw her several times before...i see no issue with texting her to ask about present...", "You're bitching about him buying an expensive gift.  It's clearly not an expensive gift to them.  \n\nYour comment is pretty meaningless in itself, sorry.", "He said it in a response.", "Because he says so in the comments.", "You reckon he's been working with the mom since he was 11?", ">I'm talking about op. Maybe they're under 18\n\nI would guess the OP is probably in their 20's based on the fact that they have a 15 year old sister and have been friends with the coworkers family for several years.  Asking a kid you have known since they were single digits what they want for a *birthday gift* isn't weird, but continued contact that isn't through the parents would be. \n\nNTA, OP, but don't contact this kid on social media again. Even though you have the best of intentions it just looks wrong.", "OP's *younger* sister is 15\n\nSo you think that OP might be someone between 15 and 18 with the capability of spending 300 euros on a present to a daughter they aren't close with (they're friends with the girl's mother, and have been for 7 years. No stated relationship with the girl)\n\nThat's a bit of a logical leap", "Yes, *it is odd*, and relying solely on the information within the post, not making any other inferences, that is an odd situation to be in.", "You can also go to op profile and check their comments", "You have no idea the dynamic between OP and the daughter. He hasn't clarified further than saying he'd met her. Messaging a teenage daughter of a friend could be very weird, and if this was the first time mum has heard of him messaging her behind her back then its a justified reaction. Given that he said in the post she said she was unhappy he messaged her, not just got the different present, it seems that was an issue as well.", "One is in a very public setting with people keeping an eye on things - One is in private between just the adult and the teenager.\n\n>shouldn't he be close enough to ask what she wants?\n\nSure, in a public setting.", "There is a difference between \"Hey, if you're coming to the party, here's a gift you can get\" and being okay with a grown adult texting her 15 year old child personally.", "\u2026yeah but, if you didn\u2019t know, you\u2019re not OP, and even though you shoved your head up their ass, you can\u2019t answer for them. So I don\u2019t care what you have to say. \n\nAnd no one is bitching, so please calm down and take some deep breaths. I hate to see you over reacting and getting so worked up. You are too emotional. Calm down.", "Oh cool, I haven't seen that but tbh I'm not reading every single comment. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Where does op say they're a man?", "I don't think it's an odd situation considering he's indicated that they are indeed close.  My point is the whole situation would be odd without considering the gift in question if they weren't close. And he has indicated in his comments that they are indeed close.", "I'm not really that interested.", "I know making assumptions is wrong in and of itself but do you honestly believe they've known each other for 7 years and he's not once met the daughter? My bestie and I have been friends since middle school and I know her kids very well. They aren't nearly old enough to have any socials but if/when they do, I'm sure I'll follow them. I'm invited to their birthdays and I get them nice gifts too. That's not strange. He's not some stranger on the Internet looking to groom young girls, he's a close long-term friend of the mom trying to get a gift she actually wants. Tell me, if op were a woman, would you still find it weird?", "One's in person and one's remote.  \n\n\nAlso considering he's known her for 7 years I think you're projecting to say it's weird for him to talk to her.", "Man you are completely exhausting to try to talk to", "in a comment, actually", "In one of their other replies", "Didn't. Bad assumption on my part. Question still stands.", "I'm not saying if it is or isn't - but it sure sounds like his coworker/the girl's mom thinks it is and that it was inappropriate. \n\nAt the end of the end of the day, it's her opinion that matters here - not yours or mine.", "BC I DONT WANNA F\u2019N TALK TO YOU like all the other women in your life", "If she thought it was inappropriate she\u2019d have said that. STOP PROJECTING YOUR FEELINGS INTO THE STORY. She\u2019s upset about the gift and she said that much.", "...Why are you posting in a public forum if you don't want to talk to people?  That's kind of the point of Reddit", ">she was very upset with me saying that I shouldn't have messaged her daughter\n\nI don't know - sounds like she was pretty upset about it to me.", "Why are you obsessed with me?", "LOL I have absolutely no idea who you are outside of the comments I am replying to.\n\nYou made a comment, I replied, you yelled at me, I replied, etc."]}
