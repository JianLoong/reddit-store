I asked her what I should get her daughter and she said that I should get a karaoke machine. But a few days later when I was hanging out with my younger sister who is around the same age as my friends daughter I told her about that karaoke machine and she basically laughed at me and said that no one actually wants that and she said I should just message her on IG and ask her what she wants instead of getting something she's gonna hate or not use. So that's what I did. She ended up sending me some links to some clothes and bags she liked and said that I should just choose one. They were all fairly expensive ones so I just chose the cheapest bag on her list which was still over 300 Euros (320 dollars for the Americans). \n\nSaturday comes and I end up giving her the bag and my friend saw that I didn't get the gift she told me to and asked me about it. So I explained everything and she was very upset with me saying that I shouldn't have messaged her daughter and that I should have just gotten the karaoke machine. We had a small argument and even her daughter told her that she never wanted a karaoke machine but my friend still insisted I was a \"jerk\" for going behind her back. She didn't talk to me at all throughout the party and even now a week later she constantly brings it up. So was AITA?\n\nEDIT: a few people have misunderstood our relationship, we're not just coworkers.

He isn't pestering this teen for pics. He's not asking inappropriate, probing questions. Hell, he's known this girl since she was 9 or 10. Let's have a little nuance. Absolutely nothing here smacks of this being anything other than a benign inquiry to a family friend.", "They are 15 not stupid. \nA family friend, whom your mother knows and is invited to your birthday party with several other people attending, messaging what you want for your birthday is not odd. \nAn old dude you don\u2019t know, your parents don\u2019t know, only wants to meet you alone is dangerous. But a huge difference. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about your situation but you could have called his mom if giving him a ride was okay, with your contacts and adress and everything. \n\nYou are infantilising teenagers. And what happens when they turn 21? They suddenly figure it out?", "I'm a woman in my mid-30s, and I have given my 17 year old male coworker a lift home a couple of times because I wanted him to get home safe. Young people are more switched on then you seem to give them credit for. It's slightly odd that your brain instantly goes to ' I could abuse this situation '.", "You can choose to believe whatever you like and some of it sounds somewhat sound but some of it sounds like you abstracting things way to far.  There is a big difference between \"Random men are trying to contact me online and buy me things\" and \"Someone my family has known for years who is coming to my birthday party has asked me what I want for my birthday.\"  15 year olds can tell the difference between the two; they might choose to ignore the difference, but knowing the difference and ignoring the difference are two very different things.", "I think you are the one sexualizing teenagers, actually.", "Okay this is gross.  I can\u2019t get over how so many people here are looking for opportunities to sexualize relationships just due to age differences. Predator behavior has nothing to do w age also so that guideline is so misleading that it is dangerous.  The biggest predators in my life have been my age.   I needed to learn about boundaries regardless of age and that\u2019s something so many commenters gnashing their teeth fail to realize in what comes off as performative righteousness.", "If from *hey your mother invited me to your birthday and asked me to get you a gift, what'd you like?* you learn *Now this kid has learned that older men messaging her and asking to buy her gifts is a good thing* the problem is within you.\n\nEspecially since they already know each other.\n\n*What happens when a creep comes along and messages her to buy her gifts, but with worse intent?*\n\nThey use their brain so they can understand context.", "What a ridiculous black and white way of thinking. \n\nCan I not message my nieces any more or give her and her friends a ride without being a creep?", "....this just sounds like you didnt want to give the kid a lift, felt bad about it but not bad enough to actually do it, and have rationalised not doing it to yourself in a fairly convoluted way", "Where does OP say they're a man? Could be a woman from what I've read", "Where does it say OP is a man?\n\nEdit: One random stranger does not set a \u201cstandard.\u201d This is absurd.", "OP must be rolling in money. I might stretch to something like that for my friend of 7 years, for a trip or something, if I had that kind of money to use for a gift. But for that friends kid? For a bag? Not a hope.", "So am I, but I'm poor.", "I'm italian and i'm one of those people (i'm literally planning a trip to Japan for this year with my best friends and since it's also a birthday vacation i'm planning on paying for their plane tickets and accomodations there), but i don't think it's entirely a matter of where you live. It's also about how you were raised, how much do you earn, how much pocket money you have after the necessities, how many people do you have to buy gifts to and how many times a year...there are a lot of variables here.", "Ah yeah, I see your point. In this case I was thinking of op flagging it to the mum so she knows the kid asked for such an expensive present. \n\nIt's tricky but something like \"jsyk I wanted to make sure I got (kid) something she likes and after talking to (other girl) I took the liberty to messaged (kid) and she asked for (item).

He asked her what she wanted, she gave a list, he got her one item from said list. I could see your reasoning if he got her every item on the list but he chose the cheapest of the options given to him. He\u2019s known the kid since she was 8, he probably has a good relationship with her if he\u2019s close with her mother.", "Every now and then I get a little bit tired...", "Look at what you seeeeee", "Oh God, no!", "It goes even weirder.\n\nTheir take is \"Never give anyone a ride because it teaches them that they can get into anyone's car and be abused\"", "How the heck do you know who is attracted to a certain gender?\n\nLol, last year I picked up a kid walking on a dangerous road to school. I *asked* if he wanted a ride. He said yes. I took him to school. Very short drive, but a long, uphill road without a sidewalk until closer to the school. \n\nAm I now a boundary-pushing abuser?", "So bisexual kids should trust no one?", "Yes Family is way more likely to sexually abuse a child than strangers.", "But he's not a stranger? He's known them for 7 years?", "They're not strangers though.

They\u2019ve known each other", "Oh I seriously beg to differ. Spend 1 week sitting in Family Court hearing what family members have done.", "When I was younger and still drove and was engaged in a couple activities (mostly community theater and historic re-enactment) where there was a blend of adults and teenagers, I often gave the kids a ride home, especially if their other option was walking home after dark or taking multiple buses. I wouldn\u2019t just drop them off, I would walk with them to their home and introduce myself to their parent/guardian so I wasn\u2019t some strange dude. \n\nOne kid, once, tried to pull an \u201cage is just a number\u201d card on me. I told his mother and never gave him a ride again. \n\nYou can support young people and still have boundaries.", "alright, didnt see that one.\nwould be nice if he included it in the post as an edit", "Meeting a kid of a good freind or following them on social media bc you have a friend in common (the parent) is completely different then randomly searching out their IG and private messaging them IMO.", "Of listening to the sound of my teeeeeeeeeears", "A-hem.\n\nDON'T STOP\nBELIEVINNNN", "Yup!  Gender and orientation and abuse have NOTHING to do with eachother.  This whole thread is ridden with the kind of accusations levelled against gay men:  can't trust us with your kids because we'll rape them.   Of course, the accusers were the Republicans and the Catholics and we all know how they are about child rape.", "According to what she said it's the opposite, no one should trust a bisexual"]}
