It is too much for a child to have to deal with. My mother had also had period issues but never noticed mine and I did not know it wasn't normal. Years of pain, embarrassment and emotional disstress could have been avoided for me if I had just had simple blood hormone tests and treatment. Many years later I was finally diagnosed with a genetic disorder that caused my issues (not PCOS, but has simalar symptoms and is often mistaken for it). Also, I think they test for my issue at birth now because it can cause many other issues including death in infants if  untreated.", "NTA at all. Fellow PCOS patient here, currently on my period and cramping ridiculously whilst using incontinence pads as my flow is too heavy for normal period pads. Your niece is entitled to know if she has a medical condition because it's her body, and she needs to know in order to be able to monitor any possible PCOS related developments. With PCOS, we have an increased chance of getting diabetes (diet needs to be monitored to mitigate the odds), certain types of cancers and also it may affect her chances of becoming pregnant when she is older. She may also end up developing facial hair and could be bullied for it. Of course, this is purely speculation and she may end up not having PCOS and may end up having easier periods as time goes on  but it's better to be able to rule anything out. Thank you for being an excellent advocate for your niece.", "NTA-PCOS is genetic and if you have it, it is likely that your niece has a high chance of having it too.

I remember having a period for 34 days through and was told I was young and would grow out of it. Endo was a big contender for what I had, but was ruled out laparoscopically. PCOS was overlooked because I had no cysts. Yet when they did the full, complete blood draw, they immediately knew it was PCOS.", "It's a bit early, but not unheard of.  Esp with all the hormones we consume in our food.

Having an earlier period isn\u2019t a reliable sign that something may be wrong.", "It's not actually unheard of to start having periods at that age. More uncommon sure, but it does happen. I do sometimes wonder though if presenting the way mine (and nieces) do are starting signs of something more. Especially now that I'm older and have spoken to more friends about it and most of them didn't have hellish first few years on theirs. Some of them hardly knew they had them and others found them sucky but not debilitating like I did.", "The age to start menstruation is between 8-13, so no.", "I\u2019m sorry, are you actually suggesting OP sneak her niece to planned parenthood without informing the parents?! THAT\u2019s overstepping.", "My gynecologist- when i was a teen- insisted of twice yearly visits because she was convinced that the reason my mom wanted me on birth control was my mom was ok with me having sex. It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that every time I got my period, I spent 8 hours throwing up.\n\nThat had to be a coinky dink.", "INFO: Have you shared any of this information with your niece? If her parents won't do anything, the nest time she sees a doctor, it's at least possible that your niece might be able to muster the courage to ask the doctor about testing her for PCOS, and explain why.", "That\u2019s awful, sorry that you had to go through that", "Huh, how often did you have periods? PCOS usually makes the periods further apart, or stops them completely. Not saying that there can be different for some people but it's not the \"normal\" sign of PCOS.\n\nYou can inform your friends that untreated PCOS can lead to complications down the line such as diabetes type 2 and heart diseases, and if she's having rich periods(and have PCOS) she most likely doesn't have ovulations which raises the risks of developing uterine cancer.", "No, I got myself to PP without any help when for the first time when I was 14.   I had a situation that I was really embarrassed about and felt I couldn't talk to an adult in my life about so I went there when my bff's older sister told me about the place.    Now the girls don't even have to go, they can do some advise only appointments via Zoom, but not many 13yo know that's even an option.    It's not my favorite group but sometimes, the do help girls with ways of talking to the adults in their lives about issues they are having, sort of knowing what to ask for and how to ask.      \n\nPeople's ego's aren't what's important when a child is suffering is all I'm saying.", "It would be overstepping if the parents get the kid adequately assessed. People can be weird as hell about gynecological issues in teenagers and if the options are the parents ignoring the kid\u2019s suffering or the kid searching out healthcare on her own I know what I\u2019d choose.", "As a soulcyster who has had PCOS for more than 50 years, you did the right thing. PCOS does run in families; two of my cousins have it. It\u2019s treatable and your niece will be better off once she gets evaluated. \n\nNTA of course.", "NTA, but I had the same experience and never had PCOS. In fact my issues stemmed from uterine fibroids that weren't visible by imaging until i was in my late 20's. \n\nRegardless it's not awful to recommend further evaluation but there are many reasons for this type of symptom and the vast majority of the people I knew at that age with issues fully outgrew them.", "I think it's actually more likely in people who have their firstperiod at an older age ([source](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/18/10/2225/622717)), but obviously, that doesn't mean people who get their periods young can't have it", "Depending on where OP lives, no, they can't take the niece to the doctor, especially if the trip ends with a birth control prescription", "This! Our family moved and I had a hard time meeting people. I finally found some great friends. One of them, Steph, was hanging out at our house one day when my then 15 F daughter was there. \n\nSteph noticed a few things and asked us some questions. Later, after DD left with friends, Steph asked me about other, more specific things. She said that\u2019s exactly symptoms she has, and she thinks DD may have this condition. That we should speak to our pediatrician about a specialist in the area. Went to see ped, who did some basic tests in office. He said he thought my friend was exactly right. \n\nWe saw a specialist 2 weeks later. DD got on a medication, and received proper therapy teaching her how to handle it and things she could do to make life easier. A month later, she was a different person. So many seemingly random complaints were gone. She\u2019s a much happier person now. \n\nAll because I listened to someone who gave me their experiences and suggested we see someone. \n\nThat\u2019s what parents do. They listen and learn, and reach out to help their kids lead better lives.", "There are two different sides to PCOS. I have a twin sister, and we both have it.

Both of us were diagnosed by medical professionals, and we have two completely different sets of symptoms.", "NTA bad parents", "NTA - However, I stress you shouldn't be quick to jump to conclusions. And I suspect that's why her parents are waiting this out. \nI have PCOS and to be clear, it's primarily a hormonal condition. She's young and still in puberty. It can take years for periods to become regular in perfectly healthy girls. \n\nSecondly, is she indicating any of the hormonal symptoms of PCOS? It's very difficult to decipher what's typical pubescent acne and PCOS associated acne, so is she exhibiting any other PCOS type physical symptoms like body hair?\n\n This could be more like endometriosis TBH.", "NTA I would call cps if they don\u2019t take her in", "Who are these people and why don't they grab at any chance to help their daughter?\n\nNTA. They are fools and no doubt why she feels 'gross' if they believe this shouldn't be discussed.", "As a fellow woman with PCOS, NTA\n\n\nI got diagnosed at 16 because my mom has it as well and it definitely calmed down the worries about all the period related stuff. It's not like you yourself diagnosed her with it but you said to get her checked out and a doctor could absolutely go an ultrasound to check for cysts - and not a transvaginal, I'm talking about a \"normal\" one.", "NYA, but your niece should be brought to a gyno to check for not just PCOS, but also endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, and hypothyroidism, and probably other things. And if the first gyno doesn't figure it out, go to another one and another one and another one until it's figured out. \n\nI had horrific periods from the very start like your niece. It was only at 53 that I was finally diagnosed with PCOS, adenomyosis, fibroids, and hypothyroidism, despite having symptoms for all since I was 12. Brought up the symptoms with literally dozens of doctors, including gynos and endocrinologists. It took what was thought to be a post-menopausal bleed thought to be cancer to finally get diagnosed properly. And not, in fact, in menopause.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for the child. I am nearly in my 40s and have only just been diagnosed with endometriosis.

They thought the same with me though and it wasn't. And I suffered for more than a decade because of it. I'm not sure on the acne or the body hair. I had some of the body hair but I didn't actually get acne with PCOS. Mine was all related to my periods which seems to be her biggest issue.", "I did share with her that I understood what she was going through because I had the same problem with them as she does. She was glad to know and she seemed to get some hope that maybe she could get somewhere since I eventually did.", "The longest I ever had between mine was 2 weeks. But I had more than was normal and I was told after diagnosis that both can be true for PCOS. You can hardly have any periods or you can be like me. That the symptoms like mine were dismissed more often as not being PCOS but something else.", "My doctors believe I may have PCOS but my periods used to be pretty regular with the exception of the occasional completely skipped one. However, those periods would last at least 10 days with very heavy flow to start with and I fit several other symptoms", "I think this is why PCOS was dismissed for me for so long. It seems many, even some doctors, only consider the symptoms you had to be signs of PCOS. Signs like mine and your twins are often expected to be something else."]}
