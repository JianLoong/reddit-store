Worst case scenario, the tests prove you wrong. But in that scenario, the doc will probably find something that provides a correct diagnosis, or at least get her on meds to manage the symptoms. I don't see a downside to the kid getting tested.\n\nYour SIL is TA for not caring about her kid having a condition that is affecting her quality of life.

Their daughter is in need of medical assistance for something that is very wrong with her body and bringing her so much misery she spoke to you about it. Shame on her parents for not getting her to a doctor.", "NTA - you have practical experience of an illness. You'd have been an AH to your niece not to mention it as a possibility to consider.  That is not over-stepping. If it gets bad enough that she ends up at doctor's or A&E, at least niece has a term to mention to doctor and that her aunt has it.", "Imagine letting your daughter suffer for so long. Doctors often dismiss women and especially young girls. That's why we always have to push to get results.  Then we're b!$@hes. I would be raising hell if my daughter's doctor wasn't doing his due diligence. I don't mind being a b!$@h. NTA.", "NTA, though you're close to the line and it's time to step carefully. Offering your experience, approaching the parents first, and then backing off and respecting their authority (whether their choices are good or bad) is... pretty much the limit of what you can do without causing offense.", "I was under the impression that the sooner it's diagnosed & treatment is started to alleviate symptoms & hormone issues, the better it is for future fertility? I may be wrong but this might be useful information for them if they want to be grandparents some day also.\n\nYou are NTA.", "Wtf. Of course NTA.\n\nPoor child", "NTA I have PCOS and I wish someone recognized the symptoms I had before I was in my 30s.", "NTA but good luck getting her any help. I believe I have PCOS but no one will diagnose me. My records read miscellaneous hormone issues. The only thing I was given was contraceptives from age 14 to help. Took them for 15+ & regret it. I\u2019m now allergic to progesterone. Doctors have given me no other options. So frustrating.", "PCOS here too. My diagnosis and treatment at age 29 changed my life dramatically.\n\nOne of the first things I did was tell my brother, just in case his then-preteen daughter might face similar issues. She doesn't, but her family appreciated having the info.\n\nNTA", "NTA- you carry the same genetics and had the same symptoms.

It's good for you to be concerned and if she is having as bad a time of it as suggested she needs to be checked out, not just for PCOS but for Endo or other Gynaecological issues. The sooner she is checked out the better her experience will be.", "NTA and what they are doing is child abuse", "NTA women\u2019s pain is often dismissed and minimized until we reach deadly levels. Absolutely good on you for talking to them. Make sure you educate your niece on advocating for herself.", "I don\u2019t know where you live but in Canada a thirteen year old can go to the doctor and get treatment without her parents being involved \nNTA", "NTA \n\nIf you can, talk with your niece about your condition and how it is so similar to what she is going through.  Then suggest that she ask her doctor about it, or school nurse,  or some other adult in her life.", "NTA. Check for adenomyosis too. Has a lot of the same symptoms.", "Let them be upset with you and please keep advocating for your niece. As someone who also had terrible periods at a young age I feel so bad for her. It is too much for a child to have to deal with. My mother had also had period issues but never noticed mine and I did not know it wasn't normal. Years of pain, embarrassment and emotional disstress could have been avoided for me if I had just had simple blood hormone tests and treatment. Many years later I was finally diagnosed with a genetic disorder that caused my issues (not PCOS, but has simalar symptoms and is often mistaken for it). Also, I think they test for my issue at birth now because it can cause many other issues including death in infants if  untreated.", "NTA at all. Fellow PCOS patient here, currently on my period and cramping ridiculously whilst using incontinence pads as my flow is too heavy for normal period pads. Your niece is entitled to know if she has a medical condition because it's her body, and she needs to know in order to be able to monitor any possible PCOS related developments. With PCOS, we have an increased chance of getting diabetes (diet needs to be monitored to mitigate the odds), certain types of cancers and also it may affect her chances of becoming pregnant when she is older. She may also end up developing facial hair and could be bullied for it. Of course, this is purely speculation and she may end up not having PCOS and may end up having easier periods as time goes on  but it's better to be able to rule anything out. Thank you for being an excellent advocate for your niece.", "NTA-PCOS is genetic and if you have it, it is likely that your niece has a high chance of having it too. You\u2019re looking out for her and her future, so much of it is lifestyle management and knowing early improves outcomes", "This, and OP is trying to look out for her. I'm not a parent, but if I was and someone thought my child might have something, I would rather them get tested and not have it then not get tested and have it affect their life.", "Some parents hate being told they missed something about their child \nNTA Op also you can look into the L brand for pads. They helped a lot with my periods because they don\u2019t have much chemicals in it like Always brand.", "I learned that at a young age when doctors were shocked my parents were willing to try different contraceptive and hormone treatments for me. It's so sad.", "Sadly that is true or they just don't believe the extent of pain they are in because it isn't the norm. I remember being a teen and I started my cycle the weekend my dad was going to take me and and stepmom out on the boat to go tubing. I had vomited up breakfast from how bad the pain was and was laying in the fetal position on the living room floor. I remember my dad saying I wish I had a period so that I could get out of doing stuff. \n\nI yelled and cried I wouldn't fake being in this much pain to get out of something I wanted to do.", "Similar things were said to me. I remember having a period for 34 days through and was told I was young and would grow out of it. Endo was a big contender for what I had, but was ruled out laparoscopically. PCOS was overlooked because I had no cysts. Yet when they did the full, complete blood draw, they immediately knew it was PCOS.", "It's a bit early, but not unheard of.  Esp with all the hormones we consume in our food.  Kids are getting their periods earlier and earlier.", "Not necessarily, the average is around 12, but plenty of girls get their period at 9 or even 8 years old. Having an earlier period isn\u2019t a reliable sign that something may be wrong.", "It's not actually unheard of to start having periods at that age. More uncommon sure, but it does happen. I do sometimes wonder though if presenting the way mine (and nieces) do are starting signs of something more. Especially now that I'm older and have spoken to more friends about it and most of them didn't have hellish first few years on theirs. Some of them hardly knew they had them and others found them sucky but not debilitating like I did.", "The age to start menstruation is between 8-13, so no.", "I\u2019m sorry, are you actually suggesting OP sneak her niece to planned parenthood without informing the parents?! THAT\u2019s overstepping.", "My gynecologist- when i was a teen- insisted of twice yearly visits because she was convinced that the reason my mom wanted me on birth control was my mom was ok with me having sex. It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that every time I got my period, I spent 8 hours throwing up.\n\nThat had to be a coinky dink.", "INFO: Have you shared any of this information with your niece? If her parents won't do anything, the nest time she sees a doctor, it's at least possible that your niece might be able to muster the courage to ask the doctor about testing her for PCOS, and explain why.", "That\u2019s awful, sorry that you had to go through that", "Huh, how often did you have periods? PCOS usually makes the periods further apart, or stops them completely. Not saying that there can be different for some people but it's not the \"normal\" sign of PCOS.\n\nYou can inform your friends that untreated PCOS can lead to complications down the line such as diabetes type 2 and heart diseases, and if she's having rich periods(and have PCOS) she most likely doesn't have ovulations which raises the risks of developing uterine cancer.", "No, I got myself to PP without any help when for the first time when I was 14.   I had a situation that I was really embarrassed about and felt I couldn't talk to an adult in my life about so I went there when my bff's older sister told me about the place.    Now the girls don't even have to go, they can do some advise only appointments via Zoom, but not many 13yo know that's even an option.    It's not my favorite group but sometimes, the do help girls with ways of talking to the adults in their lives about issues they are having, sort of knowing what to ask for and how to ask.      \n\nPeople's ego's aren't what's important when a child is suffering is all I'm saying.", "It would be overstepping if the parents get the kid adequately assessed. People can be weird as hell about gynecological issues in teenagers and if the options are the parents ignoring the kid\u2019s suffering or the kid searching out healthcare on her own I know what I\u2019d choose."]}
