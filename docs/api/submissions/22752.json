We have been taking annual \u201cBeach Days\u201d as a group since we were 16. I live about 20 minutes from the shore, where my friends live an hour away. When we were teens, my parents would host my friends, my mom would make meals for us, and everyone would use my family\u2019s beach gear. It was always a great time and my friends were very grateful to my parents for hosting. \n\nNow my partner, Green, and I have moved into our own apartment, and we\u2019re still close to the shore points. For this year\u2019s beach day, our friends would come down to our apartment, which I spent the day before beach day preparing. We planned to grab sandwiches for the beach at Wawa the next morning, so I headed to Walmart to grab drinks and snacks. \n\nI asked my friends for requests. Replies came in, so I grabbed a few multipacks, a case of water, and sunscreen. \n\nAs I was checking out, a last minute request comes in, not in the group chat, but a text to just me. My friend, Socks, is asking me if I can buy him a pack of cigarettes. Now, personally, I have nothing against smoking, I did smoke in my teens and have since switched to vaping. No health conscious soapbox here. I didn\u2019t think much of it, but reminded Socks that I was at Walmart and that we would be stopping at Wawa in the morning. I went home to get ready for a short shift at work. \n\nThe next morning, I packed the bags, and Green moved them to the car. We went to Wawa, where we all bought our own lunches. Socks didn\u2019t buy his cigarettes, but I figured he had bought a pack on the drive down, as he had gone out to smoke while Green packed the car. We headed toward the beach in two cars, and Socks and Coral were about 10 minutes ahead. I asked if they wouldn\u2019t mind please buying beach tags for the group to save time. I sent over enough money to pay for the entire groups the beach tags. We got onto the beach and settled in. \n\nInstantly I noticed Socks was in a bad mood, but I figured he must be tired. We hadn\u2019t gone to bed until 2, and we were on the beach now at 9:45am. The day went on and we had a good time until about 1:30, when we dragged ourselves back to my apartment. Everyone showered and was lounging in the living room. Green was about to go to work. Before he left with our car, I decided to take a quick trip to the vape shop for myself. As I was leaving, Socks said \u201cHey, can you grab me that thing I texted you about?\u201d Referring to the cigarettes. I told him I was going to the vape shop, and that they didn\u2019t sell tobacco. He asked if I could make a separate stop, I reminded him that Green had to get to work.\n\nWe went to the boardwalk the night, but Socks\u2019 bad attitude and grumpy mood remained. When I thought about it, I realized he must have been upset about me not buying the cigarettes. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdited because I feel I should mention: Socks was not without cigarettes at any point. He had a pack when he got to my house and was smoking throughout the day. It\u2019s just that at no point did I purchase him an additional pack.", "created_utc": 1689875171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154xv6f/aita_for_not_providing_cigarettes_for_a_beach_day/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why couldn't he grab some himself? Though, even if he couldn't, it's not your responsibility to run errands for him. Hopefully he was just in a bad mood as a result of missing nicotine, because being mad at you about it would be very entitled.\n\nETA: okay with your edit that he had cigarettes all day, you're even moreso NTA. Seems like he has it in his head that you owe him something...", "Not the asshole. Dude can buy his own cigarettes and seemed like he was lazy or trying to hide it from someone. Also 945 is hella early to start a beach day, at least for me. I usually get there around the time you leave", "NTA- You were literally at Wawa. He could have bought cigarettes there. It seems like he wanted a free pack from you instead of spending the money himself.", "NTA it sounds like he just wanted you to pay for them", "NTA why didn\u2019t Socks buy his own cigarettes at Wawa? Why did he text you separately to buy the cigarettes? If you had bought them was he going to re-pay you?", "Uh, ask the miserable git what his issue is?", "NTA He just wanted a free pack.  It's not your responsibility to provide for his personal habits the way you did for a group outing.  If he really thought it was OK to ask for those without judgment, he wouldn't have privately messaged you.", "Sorry, I'm not from the US. Doesn't Walmart sell cigarettes? I'm just curious as to why you didn't buy them when he asked you to. I'm basing my judgement on them not selling them.\n\nNTA - I think it's odd that someone would expect you to buy cigarettes for them, especially if you were stopping at a shop on the way to the beach that sells them. Why wouldn't he just buy his own cigarettes if he knew the first shop you'd be at that sells them is a shop that he would also be at? It makes no sense and seems as though he was just trying to get you to pay for his cigs.", "NTA. Socks is 25 years old, he's perfectly capable of getting cigarettes for himself. You weren't depriving him, he had cigarettes on him the entire day. Without his side of this, it just looks like he's upset he couldn't get a free pack off of you.", "NTA - it isn't about the cigs.  He probably has something else going on.  If he had cigs the whole day then he was alright.  Also, at 25, asking someone to get you a pack of fags is just childish.", "He is a grown ass man. If he is asking you to buy cigarettes, then he probably has no job and just acting like a government mooch. I would of told him to his face to buy your own shit.", "ESH\n\n> Now, personally, I have nothing against smoking\n\n#I DO.\n\nITT: Smokers and vapers", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is rather entitled to expect someone else to buy you things.", "NTA, there are Wawas down the shore. He can buy smokes if he wants them.\n\nSource: I am currently down the shore.", "Lucky some of us get there early enough to be leaving when you show up so you have a spot. :)", "If I had the characters I would have mentioned that we have always done our beach days this way, we get on the beach early in the morning and usually eat lunch shortly before we leave, we want to be off the beach by the hottest part of the day.", "Our venmo history only shows transactions going one way..", "I wasn\u2019t sure if Walmart sold tobacco products in my state- turns out they do. But I\u2019ll be honest, I was already making a solo shopping trip with a cart full of large, heavy items. I wasn\u2019t going to make a second stop at the customer service desk for his cigarettes.", "My friends and I make that request all the time, but we also pay back immediately\u2026and it\u2019s not like some secret. IDK why Socks was all hush-hush about it.", "He\u2019s just as gainfully employed as I am which makes it even more irritating. We make similar hourly amounts at full time jobs.", "I\u2019ll take this judgement, honestly I think it\u2019s gross it all comes down to being addicted to a substance and now our friendship is breaking down because because I won\u2019t fund it.", "That's what I was thinking we always got there EARLY because there was no parking left by 10am. Usually when we leave in mid afternoon someone is scouting out parking spots. One time we had a dude come ask if we were leaving soon, we were like yup just packing up and whatnot so he proceeded to stand in our spot LOL his buddy idled in the car not too far away and when we left they took our spot.", "Interesting. I like to be on the beach during the hottest parts so jumping in the water is even sweeter.", "Do you think maybe it\u2019s time to consistently start saying no to Socks? He can fund his own addictions.", "Fair enough and it's not as if you didn't tell him. You said you'd be stopping at a shop on the way to the beach that sold cigarettes so that implies that you weren't buying them at Walmart. Maybe it's just a miscommunication but you're still NTA.", "Especially when it\u2019s a friend and not a significant other.", "Then he probably spends his money recklessly", "I\u2019ll be real the water is freezing cold in the morning", "Probably. I feel like I often acquiesce to avoid conflict. This time I avoided it instead of outright saying no. I ought to be direct.", "It takes practice to say no. It\u2019s a skill well worth learning though. Says an ex people-pleaser, now a people-displeaser.", "NTA- this isn't 1955 where you put out cigs like party favors.  That is such a weird ask.", "Ex-smoker.\n\nIt's kinda gross to ask anyone to buy your cigarettes, unless they are specifically going out to buy their own cigarettes.\n\nBut, you didn't disagree to their request, so it's on you, as you didn't follow through.", "Don\u2019t give this another thought or second of your time. This is not normal behavior. People can be weird. Get used to ignoring it. \n\nNext time say \u201cOh. No thanks. I\u2019ll leave that for you to handle.\u201d", "You\u2019re only assuming he is mad and why. If he is mad, it\u2019s his job to tell you. Meanwhile he can buy his own cigs. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt's honestly difficult for me to imagine any situation in which someone is TA for NOT buying cigarettes.  This definitely isn't it.  Socks had cigarettes the whole time and just wanted a free pack, the mooch.", "NTA\u2026. Weird entitlement and power move.. sounds like a major AH", "NTA and I hope your SO's name is really Green. It's cool.", "This is the answer. He also clearly knows this isn\u2019t an appropriate ask or he\u2019s being insanely rude, because he referred to it as \u201cthe thing I asked for earlier\u201d or whatever. Why wouldn\u2019t he just say it out loud?\n\nEither he\u2019s trying to shame OP for his having to ask twice, or he didn\u2019t want others to know he wanted OP to buy him cigarettes.", "That\u2019s exactly what he wanted.", "I live next to a Wawa down the shore. \n\nSource: looking out my window", "That's why I was thinking that it has to be something else.  OP said that he DID have cigs during the day so he obviously wasn't hurting for a nicotine fix.  Maybe something back home.  I still think OP is clear of any assholery."]}
