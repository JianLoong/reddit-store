This was due to my sister, Jane's (F42), husband being a terrible person who decided to walk out on them around the time Linda turned 4.\n\nJane has suffered from sporadic depression since then, and since our parents (F77 and M81) are elderly, I have been responsible for the majority of regular parenting duties and have lived with Linda for most of her life. This situation has meant that I've had to give up some of my own life opportunities, but I consider Linda to essentially be my own daughter, and I never had any regrets about sacrificing for her sake.\n\nRecently, I think Linda has reached a bit of a rebellious stage, as over the past few months she has occasionally lashed out at me, but these have been relatively minor events that we have always sorted out.\n\nLinda has been planning to go on a beach trip with her friends for the last few days. I was under the impression that the trip would be for a few hours. But this morning, Linda told me that she and her friends had planned on staying overnight.\n\nObviously, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with this, and I told her as much. She said that they\u2019d be fine since there would be about 5 of them, but I wasn\u2019t convinced. I told her that regardless of what her friends did, she needed to be back home by the latest 8 pm on the day of the trip.\n\nShe was not happy with this and said that I was ruining the last opportunity for her and her friends to have fun before summer ended. I told her that I was going to be firm on the time and that she\u2019d need to either come home before late, or she would not be going. She argued a bit, but I kept reiterating that my decision wouldn\u2019t change.\n\nAt this stage, Linda became furious. She said that I had no right to set such an early curfew as I was only a substitute and not her real dad. I did feel pretty hurt by this, so I grounded her and said that she wouldn\u2019t be going at all.\n\nShe yelled at me some more and said that I was destroying her social life before locking herself in her room.\n\nAITA?\n\nMore context: For those wondering, the beach is about an hour's drive from our house. My niece has not told me where they would stay and to rent a hotel, they would need someone older.\n\nHer curfew is typically 9 pm. But since she would be out of town, I would like her to be home at least an hour before then.\n\nUpdate - I got in contact with one of the parents, the father of one of my niece's close friends. He told me that he had only found out recently that the trip would be hosted by one of the girl's older brothers who lives in the city.\n\nMy niece and her friends would be staying at an Airbnb that he rented out with his friends. Learning this, my answer for the trip is a firm no.

Kudos to you OP.", "NTA. She intentionally waited to tell you last minute. I may have had a different opinion if everything was up front all along but it wasn't. She hid things and now is paying the price. That's good parenting.", "NTA. Parenting is hard, and you're her guardian/de facto parent. Was there going to be any adult supervision on this trip? If not, insisting she be home by her curfew is 100% reasonable, and instituting further consequences for her outburst is warranted. Once she's calmed down though, perhaps explain why you won't let her spend the night (safety) and let her go for the day if she apologizes.

But, a little bit of TA for that time being 8pm, that\u2019s ridiculous for a 16 year old. You should consider raising it to something like 10pm-11pm. Good job on your reaction, though. You\u2019re just trying to keep her safe.", "Situation seems too complicated to assign blame to one person, I will say that 8pm curfew during summer for a 16 year old is ridiculous though.", "YTA - you grounded her because you felt hurt? You need to act more like a level headed adult and not give out punishments based on your feelings being hurt. \n\nFine to set the no overnight rule but 8p is so early for a 16yo. You could have used this as an opportunity to build trust and healthy rules - a 10p curfew and talk about why overnights aren't allowed and get a better understanding of what was planned", "NTA\n\nKids yell when they don't get their way, but I would not let my 16-year-old go stay overnight on a beach without parents there too.", "8 pm at 16? YTA", "NTA she's too young to be staying overnight somewhere with friends. You're an excellent parent OP.\n\nYou did everything right she just doesn't like the decision being made.

An overnight beach trip isn't unreasonable for a 16 year old with several friends - assuming of course that you've allowed her age-appropriate levels of freedom all along so she's ready for it.

Then grounded her bc in true teenager fashion she responded you aren\u2019t her dad. 3. Did you even ask her how she would get a hotel room? Most hotels require you to be at least 20/21 to get a room lol. Soft YTA. Unless 8 pm is her alway curfew that was harsh. You didn\u2019t ask for details. A parent could have been going.

Yeah, that sounds exactly like they're planning a bunch of stuff they know all the parents wouldn't approve of, and hoping to sneak under the radar. This isn't \"I want to camp at the beach with my friends\" - this is \"me and my friends want to meet up at the beach with a few hundred other people for wild debauchery\".

Not the morning of that trip.", "Children should not stay out overnight unsupervised.", "Well tough luck for her, you are the parenting figure so you can decide what is weird and unnecessary.

If there will be adult supervision, and you're comfortable with it, would you reconsider letting her spend the night (after she apologizes)? To me, if another trusted parent will be there to supervise that's another ballgame and I would likely let her go if I were you.

Fair enough. \n\nBut she\u2019s 16, not 6. An 8pm curfew on a Friday mid-summer does seem overly strict and I think her reaction to that is part of being 16 and wanting to start feeling some independence. \n\nI feel like there was a missed opportunity to compromise here and you both probably could communicate better - you expressing why you felt it wasn\u2019t safe (you say obviously, but it\u2019s not obvious to me why a teenager can\u2019t stay out overnight if you know where they are and who they\u2019re with and have safety precautions in place); her sharing details with enough notice to find those safety precautions. \n\nI do also wonder if you\u2019re this strict in other areas and if that\u2019s maybe why she\u2019s rebelling? 16 is old enough to start being given a bit of independence now and then. Has she proven to be untrustworthy or undeserving of that? If not, maybe look at ways you can gradually give her some age-appropriate freedom.

If so, you are going to have a very steep mountain to climb as she continues into her late teens. \n\nAnd 8 pm on a weekend during the summer? For a 16 yr old? Ok, sure. Maybe staying at the beach is a no go but EIGHT p.m.? That is ridiculous. If you had come to a compromise on the curfew rather than doubling down and now refusing to let her go at all, your would be in a much better position to sit down and do some additional renegotiations on curfews and other things she should now be able to do since she is 16.\n\nYTA", "NTA. I know her words hurt. Teenagers are experts at getting right to the hurtful spots. As a former teenage girl, I feel it\u2019s very likely she will soon regret her words but struggle with apologizing. Boundaries are important. If she were going out for an evening, an 8 pm curfew would be unreasonable. But, for an all day trip, it seems fair. Sixteen is too young to have an unsupervised overnight in a location away from home. Since she didn\u2019t want you to speak to the other parents, it\u2019s as likely as not they\u2019ve concocted something sneaky. \n\nI did the same thing at 17 to sneak off to spend the night with girlfriends in the French Quarter, during Mardi Gras.

She's 16 man.", "An 8pm curfew for a 16 year old is crazy", "Wtf. Am i the only one who finds this super weird? 8pm curfew at the age of 16? How is this different from a sleep over? None of you had sleepovers at your friends house without parents or went hang out outside untill like 4am? I dont even know what to say ESH/NAH.", "If she is a responsible and sensible teen, and would call if anything happens, overnight stay could be ok. But since she decided telling you last minute, either she likes hiding things or you are too strict that she is afraid of reaching out. It must be hard trying to protect your kid, but if she thinks you are not a safe space it will only hurt her, therefore you. Grounding her for lashing out is a mistake, you should've sit her down and talk after sending her to her room for a while.\n\n\nNTA for the boundaries and enforcing them. But 8 is too early. And since it is only an hour away, you could've let her stay longer so she won't be singled out.", "Based on your answers NTA. Maybe I\u2019ve seen too much true crime videos but this just screams disaster. The fact that she didn\u2019t want you to contact other parents makes it even more suspicious.", "ESH. Of course Linda for acting out in many of these ways and for what she said. You for the ridiculously early curfew. Is that a normal curfew? What is that time tied to? Why not a later time.\n\nThe no-overnight stance is perfectly reasonable but it seems like you blew past a middle ground here.", "NTA. I think Linda deliberately avoided telling you it was an overnight trip, so any responsible parent would wonder what else she was deceiving you about.  She didn\u2019t want you to talk to the other parents either, also suspicious.\nThat said, when you calm down a bit, decide how you could be comfortable with this sort of thing in the future, and talk to Linda about it.  Tell her you know she is disappointed and you are sorry she missed this trip, but her lack of honesty worried you.  Tell her how to handle this in the future, and assure her you will allow overnight trips under the conditions you specify-a weeks notice, you know the other kids, you can talk to the other parents, available by cell phone always-whatever your conditions are.  And by all means tell her how hurtful her comment was and ask her to apologize.", "NTA \n\nShe can\u2019t go without giving you details that you find acceptable. \n\nCall some of the other parents. Sounds like teenage shenanigans to me.\n\nOh the stuff I used to do\u2026", "NTA \nI had a similar situation with my daughter, who at 16, thought I would be cool with her and her bestie walking to the movie theater late at night for a midnight showing. It's about a 1/2 mi. away. I said abso-fucking-lutely not. Man, I was the bad guy. I don't even know if her bestie's parents were okay with it. Don't care. They are good girls, but it's not them I was worried about. It's the freaky-dinks out there trolling in the middle of the night.  \n\nShe's still a minor. The plans seemed to be covert. Fun can still be had before curfew.", "Is she in therapy? It is not uncommon to start pushing for more independence and rebelling some as a teenager. She has bigger hurdles than typical teenage drama though. Her dad is gone her mom is unreliable at best. That could cause her to act out\n\nNTA- but find out more details to see if there is away you would feel comfortable allowing her to go. I would talk to the other parents too. I can\u2019t help but wonder if you are all in the dark as there is no way they will be able to rent a room. Also, how are they getting there? I\u2019m assuming they are all new drivers? Are they even allowed to give rides to friends yet?\n\nI also think it is perfectly acceptable to punish her for being rude to you. When she is calm, I would sit her down and talk to her. Tell her how much you love her and that you have been happy to care for her, as well as sacrifice for her. Let her know that it was cruel if her to throw your sacrifice back in your face. Let her know she always has a place with you   She does need to be respectful though. Where would she be if you hadn\u2019t taken her in. Does she realize?\n\nIt sounds like you are doing a great job! Keep us posted!", "I think you need to speak to the friends parents, and if you're firm (for probably good reason) on the overnight not happening, I think 8 is too early for a 16yo. 11 would be reasonable imo.\n\nMy curfew was 2 am at 15 or so, yeah, 8 is for children, which she isn't fully anymore.\n\nNot sure about verdict, grounding was an overreaction, but talk to the other parents, see what is going on. She may be rebellious because the leash is a bit too tight. I think it may be time to renegotiate some things with her.", "l", "Agreed, I had basically no curfew growing up as I never abused it.  I was usually home by 8 or so when I was under 10.  Once I was 12, I was usually home by 10 or so, mostly because all my friends had curfews and staying out after dark by myself was boring.  When I turned 14, my parents got me a cell phone with like 500 minutes a month on it.  (I was the cool kid in high school because I was the only one with a cell phone, 2000-2004).  I regularly stayed out til 1 or so once I got a car.  My parents didn\u2019t really care what I did so long as I kept up on my chores and my grades were decent, provided they knew roughly where I was, and I answered the phone if they called.\n\nIf they had tried to enforce an 8pm curfew when I was 16 and had a car, I am pretty sure I would have moved out.", "Why would a 16 year old have some innate knowledge that this is an inappropriate ask, especially if her friends' parents have allowed it?", "16 is still young there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to keep kids safe.

Just no.  Never.  Forget it.  If anything happened, you could end up charged by the po po too.", "I still don't understand how coming home at 8 instead of 9 will help \"in case something happens?\" Also 9 is insanely early for a 16 year old, I was sometimes still at extracurriculars by 9 pm, let alone study groups.", "Well, 9 PM is too early for a teen her age. She wouldn't even be able to watch a movie at 7 with her friends with a curfew that early. And if she gets a job it would make it difficult for her to work too. Why not give her at least a little more freedom and extend her regular curfew (I'm not talking about this trip; I mean for other days) to 10 PM?", "This. NOBODY'S parents know what is going on. I speak from experience lol", "> Also 9 is insanely early for a 16 year old, I was sometimes still at extracurriculars by 9 pm, let alone study groups.\n\nI agree - especially in the summer. At 14 I was often out past 21:00 (9 PM) on school nights (with a reason, and my parents knowing where I was) - let alone in the Summer!\n\nAt 16 in the summer & weekends - I was often out past midnight, as long as I had communicated my plans with my parents.", "What the hell is this comment lol for one you don't know that they'll even be in a position to be roofied, not every teen is drinking underage in bars, but also what??? Five teens are not \"likely\" to get abducted, real life is not an episode of SVU.", ">At 16 in the summer & weekends - I was often out past midnight, as long as I had communicated my plans with my parents.\n\nHeck - at 16 in the summer and weekends - I was often babysitting and responsible for OTHER children until between 23:00 and 02:00. Most of my Professional Personal Childcare Clients were single Moms who wanted to go out on dates - and didn't want to be home early.\n\nAt 16 and 17 - I also drove myself to and from Scout Camp 4 hours drive from where we lived. I worked as a staff member, again, in charge of the safety of other children.", "\ud83d\ude06 You're clearly not a parent, so I don't know why you feel qualified to voice an opinion on this. Sure, you don't know they're in a position to be roofied, but more importantly, if you're not there you don't know that they're not. Rapists and traffickers tend to target people lacking in situational awareness. Like 16 year olds. Which you'd know if you had like _any_ experience in these matters.\n\nEdit: Loving the drive-by downvotes on this comment, from what I can only guess are specifically teenaged kids pissed that their parents won't let them go on trips with only other teenagers.

It's extremely kid dependent.", "That wouldn\u2019t have worked with my parents (they would have perceived that as extremely presumptuous and I\u2019d get an automatic no), but it definitely illustrates my point. Teenagers get very good at figuring out how to convince their parents to allow things.", "You are NTA for this situation, but your curfew of 9 pm for a 16-year old is ridiculous. Kids won\u2019t learn to manage their time or practice independence with that kind of rule. My kids had no curfew when they were teens, but they had to keep me updated on their location (if they changed where they were) and plans. If they stayed out too late and were tired the next day, they learned via natural consequence to manage themselves better. You have to start preparing her for adulthood.", "No rewards for lying by omission.", ">take it with a grain of salt. you\u2019re allowed to feel hurt, but keep in mind she is only saying that because she didn\u2019t get her way and it likely is not at all personal or how she actually feels about you\n\nAbsolutely, I was not upset for long as I remember how she used to make me ~~father's~~ uncle's day cards when she was younger \ud83d\ude02", "I'm pretty flexible around 9 pm for things like movies and such.

Also human traffickers are much more likely to be a family member or someone close to the family than a random kidnapper.

There was no info on where they were staying, or who with, or why. All of this screams 'I'm trying to get away with something I don't think you'll approve of' because I used it as a teen.\n\nI see a recent edit that the older brother of one of nieces' friends rented an airbnb. Is that older brother trusted? Is the FRIENDS the older brother's with trusted? Because if he's renting it with friends, then he/his friends are at least 18, probably 20-21. That turns this from '5 teenage girls try camping on the beach' to '5 teenage girls spend the night with maybe-trustworthy boys age 18-25 and don't want to say what they're doing'.

Stop stifling the poor girl and let her be a normal teenager. She's gonna drink, smoke weed and have sex. She can either sneak out and do it behind your back god knows where, or you can accept she's growing up and let her live, while also fostering a healthy relationship where she knows she can tell you everything and you can make sure she's safe.", "Full agree. It seems common sense to me. Not all people without kids are going to say things like the comment I was responding to, but I feel pretty confident saying that only a childless person could be so wrongheaded about looking after the safety of a child.", "NTA, but an 8 pm or even a 9pm curfew for a 16 year old is a little ridiculous."]}
