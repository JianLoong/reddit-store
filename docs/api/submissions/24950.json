Yes if she ask to sleep in a dirty motel with two boy you never heard off I would freak out too, but there is a lot of safe option for her to have a trip with friend overnight. \n\nI think you should have looked in their plan, talk with the other parents and see how the trip could happen with you being comfortable.

Kudos to you OP.", "NTA. She intentionally waited to tell you last minute. I may have had a different opinion if everything was up front all along but it wasn't. She hid things and now is paying the price. That's good parenting.", "NTA. Parenting is hard, and you're her guardian/de facto parent. Was there going to be any adult supervision on this trip? If not, insisting she be home by her curfew is 100% reasonable, and instituting further consequences for her outburst is warranted. Once she's calmed down though, perhaps explain why you won't let her spend the night (safety) and let her go for the day if she apologizes. If she won't apologize/adjust her attitude, then I say hold firm. P.S. You're doing a great job and she's lucky to have you in her life!", "NTA you are being a parent. It\u2019s hard sometimes.

But, a little bit of TA for that time being 8pm, that\u2019s ridiculous for a 16 year old. You should consider raising it to something like 10pm-11pm. Good job on your reaction, though. You\u2019re just trying to keep her safe.", "Situation seems too complicated to assign blame to one person, I will say that 8pm curfew during summer for a 16 year old is ridiculous though.", "YTA - you grounded her because you felt hurt? You need to act more like a level headed adult and not give out punishments based on your feelings being hurt. \n\nFine to set the no overnight rule but 8p is so early for a 16yo. You could have used this as an opportunity to build trust and healthy rules - a 10p curfew and talk about why overnights aren't allowed and get a better understanding of what was planned", "NTA\n\nKids yell when they don't get their way, but I would not let my 16-year-old go stay overnight on a beach without parents there too.", "8 pm at 16? YTA", "NTA she's too young to be staying overnight somewhere with friends. You're an excellent parent OP.\n\nYou did everything right she just doesn't like the decision being made.

You're doing great \u2764\ufe0f", "Ehhh, I admit it's debatable, but I think YTA. An overnight beach trip isn't unreasonable for a 16 year old with several friends - assuming of course that you've allowed her age-appropriate levels of freedom all along so she's ready for it. If you haven't, if she's super naive because you've been overprotective her whole life, then you're an asshole for that.

Then grounded her bc in true teenager fashion she responded you aren\u2019t her dad. 3. Did you even ask her how she would get a hotel room? Most hotels require you to be at least 20/21 to get a room lol. Soft YTA. Unless 8 pm is her alway curfew that was harsh. You didn\u2019t ask for details. A parent could have been going. And you punished her for saying you aren\u2019t dad. It was a low blow but a harsh punishment.", "YTA 8pm?

Everything being slid in under the radar at the last minute? Yeah, that sounds exactly like they're planning a bunch of stuff they know all the parents wouldn't approve of, and hoping to sneak under the radar. This isn't \"I want to camp at the beach with my friends\" - this is \"me and my friends want to meet up at the beach with a few hundred other people for wild debauchery\". Everything about this plan says \"bad idea\".\n\nNTA", "What does your sister think about this?", "\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 I'm not laughing at you.\nI'm 46 now.\nMy mother still recollects how every time they didn't agree with my plans as a teenager I would rage how they ruin my last something, last summer before highschool, last summer before important high school exams, last holiday before competition, last day before whatever, last chance before big (minor) change, last...last...last...\n\nEverything was drama field \ud83d\ude09\n\nThis too shall pass.\n\n\nBy the way asked my mom recently (I'm a mom of a teenager now)when did I stopped and everything calmed down and she told me ....when you moved out \ud83d\ude06 after my bachelor's degree.\nStay strong you have a normal teen.", ">talk with the other parents and see how the trip could happen with you being comfortable\n\nI have considered that option, but when we were negotiating she told me that would be weird and unnecessary.

Not the morning of that trip.", "Children should not stay out onernight unsupervised.", "Well tough luck for her, you are the parenting figure so you can decide what is weird and unnecessary.

If there will be adult supervision, and you're comfortable with it, would you reconsider letting her spend the night (after she apologizes)? To me, if another trusted parent will be there to supervise that's another ballgame and I would likely let her go if I were you.

And if not, why can't she stay out a little later, like until 10 PM?", "YTA for giving her an 8pm curfew at 16 how is she ever suppose to learn how to be an adult if you don't give her some space.", "Going against the grain and saying NAH. \n\nYou\u2019re trying to do right and keep her safe, and have rules in place. Fair enough. \n\nBut she\u2019s 16, not 6. An 8pm curfew on a Friday mid-summer does seem overly strict and I think her reaction to that is part of being 16 and wanting to start feeling some independence. \n\nI feel like there was a missed opportunity to compromise here and you both probably could communicate better - you expressing why you felt it wasn\u2019t safe (you say obviously, but it\u2019s not obvious to me why a teenager can\u2019t stay out overnight if you know where they are and who they\u2019re with and have safety precautions in place); her sharing details with enough notice to find those safety precautions. \n\nI do also wonder if you\u2019re this strict in other areas and if that\u2019s maybe why she\u2019s rebelling? 16 is old enough to start being given a bit of independence now and then. Has she proven to be untrustworthy or undeserving of that? If not, maybe look at ways you can gradually give her some age-appropriate freedom.

There is a reason why high school aged people stay overnight at the beach, and without an adult to keep an eye on them, that\u2019s just asking for trouble. And she would have still been able to go and have fun during the day, but she didn\u2019t want that. \n\nAnd then with the way she behaved and the words she said, you are definitely NTA for grounding her and taking it away entirely.", "You actually think that grounding her for reminding you that you aren't her dad is appropriate? If so, you are going to have a very steep mountain to climb as she continues into her late teens. \n\nAnd 8 pm on a weekend during the summer? For a 16 yr old? Ok, sure. Maybe staying at the beach is a no go but EIGHT p.m.? That is ridiculous. If you had come to a compromise on the curfew rather than doubling down and now refusing to let her go at all, your would be in a much better position to sit down and do some additional renegotiations on curfews and other things she should now be able to do since she is 16.\n\nYTA", "NTA. I know her words hurt. Teenagers are experts at getting right to the hurtful spots. As a former teenage girl, I feel it\u2019s very likely she will soon regret her words but struggle with apologizing. Boundaries are important. If she were going out for an evening, an 8 pm curfew would be unreasonable. But, for an all day trip, it seems fair. Sixteen is too young to have an unsupervised overnight in a location away from home. Since she didn\u2019t want you to speak to the other parents, it\u2019s as likely as not they\u2019ve concocted something sneaky. \n\nI did the same thing at 17 to sneak off to spend the night with girlfriends in the French Quarter, during Mardi Gras. We found so much trouble and it\u2019s a miracle we didn\u2019t end up dead. The risks we took were\u2026 unacceptable.
