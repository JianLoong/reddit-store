This was due to my sister, Jane's (F42), husband being a terrible person who decided to walk out on them around the time Linda turned 4.\n\nJane has suffered from sporadic depression since then, and since our parents (F77 and M81) are elderly, I have been responsible for the majority of regular parenting duties and have lived with Linda for most of her life.

I was under the impression that the trip would be for a few hours.

I told her that I was going to be firm on the time and that she\u2019d need to either come home before late, or she would not be going. She argued a bit, but I kept reiterating that my decision wouldn\u2019t change.\r\n\nAt this stage, Linda became furious. She said that I had no right to set such an early curfew as I was only a substitute and not her real dad. I did feel pretty hurt by this, so I grounded her and said that she wouldn\u2019t be going at all.\r\n\nShe yelled at me some more and said that I was destroying her social life before locking herself in her room.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1692375659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15up1i0/aita_for_banning_my_niece_from_her_beach_trip/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That said, do you have a reason to feel unsafe and did you try to look for a compromise?\n\nI mean she is 16yo, she isn't 5 anymore. Yes if she ask to sleep in a dirty motel with two boy you never heard off I would freak out too, but there is a lot of safe option for her to have a trip with friend overnight. \n\nI think you should have looked in their plan, talk with the other parents and see how the trip could happen with you being comfortable. But it seem that it was an automatic No from you just because you don't want her to have a trip overnight.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s learning a lesson of never bite the hand that feeds you. Teenagers at this stage tend to over exaggerate and say cruel things out of impulse. What she did was out of line. Hopefully she grows up and be grateful for what you did help raising her. Kudos to you OP.", "NTA. She intentionally waited to tell you last minute. I may have had a different opinion if everything was up front all along but it wasn't. She hid things and now is paying the price. That's good parenting.", "NTA. Parenting is hard, and you're her guardian/de facto parent. Was there going to be any adult supervision on this trip? If not, insisting she be home by her curfew is 100% reasonable, and instituting further consequences for her outburst is warranted. Once she's calmed down though, perhaps explain why you won't let her spend the night (safety) and let her go for the day if she apologizes. If she won't apologize/adjust her attitude, then I say hold firm. P.S. You're doing a great job and she's lucky to have you in her life!", "NTA you are being a parent. It\u2019s hard sometimes. Our kids aren\u2019t always going to like us and our decisions. Plus they need to learn the repercussion of their actions. This is pretty standard parenting. She\u2019ll live.", "NTA for not allowing her to go, she probably told you last minute on purpose. You told her what would happen if she didn\u2019t listen. But, a little bit of TA for that time being 8pm, that\u2019s ridiculous for a 16 year old. You should consider raising it to something like 10pm-11pm. Good job on your reaction, though. You\u2019re just trying to keep her safe.", "Situation seems too complicated to assign blame to one person, I will say that 8pm curfew during summer for a 16 year old is ridiculous though.", "YTA - you grounded her because you felt hurt? You need to act more like a level headed adult and not give out punishments based on your feelings being hurt. \n\nFine to set the no overnight rule but 8p is so early for a 16yo. You could have used this as an opportunity to build trust and healthy rules - a 10p curfew and talk about why overnights aren't allowed and get a better understanding of what was planned", "NTA\n\nKids yell when they don't get their way, but I would not let my 16-year-old go stay overnight on a beach without parents there too.", "8 pm at 16? YTA", "NTA she's too young to be staying overnight somewhere with friends. You're an excellent parent OP.\n\nYou did everything right she just doesn't like the decision being made. Just because she's hurt and lashing out now doesn't mean that she really hates you. She's frustrated and has big feelings. You're doing great \u2764\ufe0f", "Ehhh, I admit it's debatable, but I think YTA. An overnight beach trip isn't unreasonable for a 16 year old with several friends - assuming of course that you've allowed her age-appropriate levels of freedom all along so she's ready for it. If you haven't, if she's super naive because you've been overprotective her whole life, then you're an asshole for that. If she's ready but you're not, you're still an asshole for letting your fears keep her from enjoying her summer.", "YTA, you need some family therapy where you'll learn children grow up and need more autonomy, trust and respect.", "YTA. \n\nDid you try to find out anything specific about their overnight plans or just immediately shoot it down? Did they have somewhere safe to stay, like a relative's beach house? Were any adults going to be nearby? Was it all girls or mixed group? Does daughter typically party or not? \n\n8 pm?? It's still light outside here at 8. If you'd banned here from the overnight part but given her a later curfew, she wouldn't have been as upset.\n\nGrounding her for being upset and saying stereotypical \"you're not my dad\" stuff? Take a deep breath, let her be mad for awhile, then talk to her later.", "So let me get this straight: 1. You set an early verges when she didn\u2019t have school or work the next day. 2. Then grounded her bc in true teenager fashion she responded you aren\u2019t her dad. 3. Did you even ask her how she would get a hotel room? Most hotels require you to be at least 20/21 to get a room lol. Soft YTA. Unless 8 pm is her alway curfew that was harsh. You didn\u2019t ask for details. A parent could have been going. And you punished her for saying you aren\u2019t dad. It was a low blow but a harsh punishment.", "YTA 8pm? For anyone over the age 12 is an insult.", "YTA she's 16, you're punishing her because you felt hurt and don't want to convine with other parents because you don't want to think about what could happen, in my opinion its unfair to her", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Everything being slid in under the radar at the last minute? Yeah, that sounds exactly like they're planning a bunch of stuff they know all the parents wouldn't approve of, and hoping to sneak under the radar. This isn't \"I want to camp at the beach with my friends\" - this is \"me and my friends want to meet up at the beach with a few hundred other people for wild debauchery\". Everything about this plan says \"bad idea\".\n\nNTA", "What does your sister think about this?", "\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 I'm not laughing at you.\nI'm 46 now.\nMy mother still recollects how every time they didn't agree with my plans as a teenager I would rage how they ruin my last something, last summer before highschool, last summer before important high school exams, last holiday before competition, last day before whatever, last chance before big (minor) change, last...last...last...\n\nEverything was drama field \ud83d\ude09\n\nThis too shall pass.\n\n\nBy the way asked my mom recently (I'm a mom of a teenager now)when did I stopped and everything calmed down and she told me ....when you moved out \ud83d\ude06 after my bachelor's degree.\nStay strong you have a normal teen.", ">talk with the other parents and see how the trip could happen with you being comfortable\n\nI have considered that option, but when we were negotiating she told me that would be weird and unnecessary. That also did make me worry about it more. Do they even know what's being planned?", ">Was there going to be any adult supervision on this trip?\n\nI honestly don't think there was, which was partially why I was worried.\n\n>P.S. You're doing a great job and she's lucky to have you in her life!\n\nThank you so much, I appreciate it!", "What cracks me up about this is no hotel will rent to teenagers. There will have to be an adult with them.", "It is when you don't give prior heads up. She only told him last minute this morning. Overnight trips (especially when supervision is questionable) are something that should be fully discussed at this age. Not the morning of that trip.", "Children should not stay out onernight unsupervised.", "Well tough luck for her, you are the parenting figure so you can decide what is weird and unnecessary. I tend to give the kids a choice, in that case she can help you make sure the trip is safe and you are comfortable with it, or she can refuse just don't go.", "Yeaaaah 16 year olds spending the night at the beach alone with no adults = guaranteed (potentially dangerous) shenanigans and a no-go in my book. \n\nCould you ask her for more information, like who planned the trip, what adult(s) will be present etc? If there will be adult supervision, and you're comfortable with it, would you reconsider letting her spend the night (after she apologizes)? To me, if another trusted parent will be there to supervise that's another ballgame and I would likely let her go if I were you. I'd still definitely have a talk with her and make sure she understands her reaction and what she said was wrong, but it could be a good opportunity to model open, thoughtful communication and give her the chance to own up and apologize. My two cents anyway!", "That's true, I'm pretty sure she has not told me everyone who will be going on the trip aside from her and her four friends...", "What cracks me up is that a group of teens are planning to go to the beach, and you're assuming that they want a hotel.
