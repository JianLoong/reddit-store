You are NTA because your mom left everything to you, but it feels like the right thing to do is to give your sister the house if you can afford it.", "Perhaps you could offer to sell her the house at market value or just below so she can stay there.  If she can\u2019t afford it that is not your concern.  She sounds entitled for asking for her name to be put on the deed \u201cafter it is paid off.\u201d  In my opinion, if she has not been good to you and a positive influence in your life you do not owe her anything.  You can be generous and give her a long time to move out.", "If the houses were joint assets of your parents and bought by both of them your sister is inheriting nothing just because your father passed away first.  She's not entitled to an inheritance but I can see why she'd think she'd get a share of her dad's assets now they're passing down to the next generation. \n\nNTA because you're following the process of your mom dying without a will but unless you know your dad didn't want her to inherit the fair thing to do would be to give her half of her dad's assets that are left.", "NTA don\u2019t gift the house or half to this person. She\u2019s entitled AF. Honestly she\u2019s been living at a significantly reduced rate for 20 years it seems. She isn\u2019t owed a house because she paid a bit of rent.
