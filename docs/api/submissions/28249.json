Once added in some states she could force the sale of the house to get her share of the equity.  \n\nAs your mother I presume owned the property your dad\u2019s daughter rents there ideally is a lease agreement that she signed.   You should discuss with the lawyer unless you already know to get a new lease agreement signed that clearly identifies her as your tenant with no ownership of the property.  Also that clearly states the reasons for which when she can be evicted such as not paying the rent in full and on time and what ever else needs to be stated about eviction in a lease.  \n\nYou\u2019ll want to check the insurance on the property to confirm they update so it shows you as the owner and the most recent appraised value of the property is being used.  Also that the insurance only covers the house - not the contents unless it is rented fully furnished.  \n\nAnd yes your dad was right family can be the worst to do business with as any number of them expect a special deal or to get things for free.

And technically before your father passed was this \u201ctheir\u201d house and your mother inherited ownership after death or what because that would be kind of screwing your half siblings over a bit. Went through this years ago, step grandfather died property transferred to my grandmother, when she died assets were split among all the siblings fairly his kids and hers  (even my estranged uncle) even though my dad could\u2019ve fought it, he never would fight it though because it\u2019s his family regardless of blood relation. \n\nAlso the phrasing and coldness towards OPs siblings makes me think there\u2019s something else going on here, I feel details missing or being held back from the story we received.
