Sorry about that.\n\nHow do you get \"no assignments are required\"? She is your teacher. She is the person that does the requiring of assignments.\n\nIn what way is she \"extremely mean\" to the class? It sounds like she's a strict teacher, and doesn't tolerate messing about in her classes.", "YTA. \n\nA good exercise is to ask yourself how your teacher and your mother would have described this. How do you think your math teacher would describe what happened? Do you think she would feel that she was being extremely mean to the class? Do you think that you would think that she is yelling at you constantly? Do you think she would think giving you 10+ assignments over a holiday is way over the line,  even though no assignments are required? And finally, do you think that she would think that she had yelled at you and your girlfriend for not wanting to do advanced math this year? Start there. \n\nWhen it comes to your mother, she is correct that certain cultures have different ways of communicating. That\u2019s no great shock, I know. But rather than looking at this as a justification for behavior,  think of it as looking at it through a different pair of glasses. How might an Indian student have perceived her behavior? \n\nThis is gonna be downvoted very quickly, so read it while you can lol.", "Tjanks xaaos dildo", "Sadly there's nothing I can do about it because \"I'm a child and I know nothing of the real world\"", "I understand that I'm not \"pushing my potential\", but I want to be an English teacher, I don't need math at all for that job. And she didn't have to yell at me in front of the entire class.", "In my school assignments aren't required over holidays and teachers need to get their curriculum done within school time. Our class isn't messing around, god it's online no one even speaks unless answering a question. She just yells whenever we get something wrong, if we aren't there or if we don't do something the second it's set. Example, she set an assignment on Sunday and yelled at us on Monday for not doing it, no one knew it was set because no one checks emails on a fucking Sunday.", "How would I know how they viewed the situation if I'm not them? I'm basing this on the viewpoints I have. No one in the class likes her, and it's a class of 15+ people, I think that speaks for itself. We've had other teachers have to be in the lesson with us because of how much she shouts. She's been reported multiple times for her behavior.", "Way to blame the victim for not being okay with a teacher treating them bad. It's because of people like you that victims don't always come upfront to report being abused.", "Huh \ud83d\ude2d", "You already have done something. You acknowledge and recognize cruelty.", "I mean, you will need to know some basic math to grade things, but you are correct about probably not needing advanced math to do your job.\n\nBut the things you learn in school aren't usually about what you'll need for your job. My favorite explanation was of someone asking whether football players need to be able to lift weights or do pull ups during the game. With the answer being obviously not, but they do those things to train their muscles.\n\nAnd that's exactly what the basic subjects in school do - they train your brain. History is about learning about motivations of people, about the mistakes we made in the past, and the advancements we've made along the way so you can make judgements about what's happening in the world in the present. English is reading comprehension and how to write, both very important skills to have. Science is about learning how the world works but also about the scientific method, something you can use to approach the world around you and attempt to understand it. And math is about how to approach a problem logically, how to break it down into smaller parts, and how to recognize what you need to solve it. \n\nYour teacher sounds horrible, but you shouldn't let her ruin math for you.", "You\u2019re right on all accounts. But based on my friends science and therefore math rule their education.", "This is an empathy exercise. Put yourself in her shoes and imagine how you might feel if you were her.", "Math is still compulsory, I'm just doing essential which is like paying bills etc. I don't enjoy math, I've never had nice math teachers and this is probably a stupid reason to hate the subject but one of them sa'd me so I just cannot enjoy it anymore. It reminds me of him.", "I do not know how to do that because I don't know her life. It genuinely doesn't make sense to me.", "Put yourself in op's shoes. She is dealing with a horrible teacher that has been reported many times for treating the students bad. Being a different ethnicity is not an excuse to berate your students.", "Empathy does not require you know her but that you look beyond yourself and try to understand her. You don't need a manual on her life to do that.", "Just like you don't need a manual of how to blame the victim, which is what you're doing"]}
