My dad comes from a Muslim background but he's not religious. My mum doesn't come from any religious background and isn't religious either, I'm quite similar to my mum.\n\nMy dad has married my step mother about 3 years ago. She and her side of the family are very religious and quite strict in how they practice. They're very conservative and quite inflexible when it comes to others around them. She's always clashing with me about how my lack of practice reflects poorly on her in her community and how a little effort from me could go a long way in helping our family.\n\nI generally don't give an inch. Obviously needless to say I don't have any problems with religious people (of any religion) and I respect them as long as it's reciprocal and they respect me back. Naturally I also live in this community and most of my friends are from the same background, and we get along perfectly.\n\nLast night her mother was visiting us for dinner and told us she is throwing a family and friends party and we're all invited. But looked at me and said modest Islamic clothing only. I said I'm gonna wear what I typically wear to any family party and she said no she won't allow it in her house. In case you don't know, what she wants are 1) hair covered, 2) not showing any skin apart from face and feet, and 3) clothes to be loose so they wouldn't show body figure.\n\nI said fine, thanks for the invitation but if I'm not welcome as me then I'll pass [edit: and won't come.]\n\nUp until this point it was a polite conversation. But after this she attacked my character and I responded. This is how it went from there, I'll quote directly as best as I can remember:\n\nHer: This is the kind of party where the whole family comes or none of them come. You can be your own person on your own time but you have family obligations too and wouldn't kill you to do it for once in your life.\n\nMe: You have no idea of my obligations or how I handle them, you're out of line and should back off.\n\nHer: And you should respect your religion and elders so if you know what's good for you when I tell you this is what you wear you should say yes.\n\nMe: I don't respect this nonsense. And your party and religion, you know where to shove them.\n\nThen said I've lost my appetite, looked at my dad and told him thanks for standing up for me, and left. I called my mum and she came to pick me up, haven't spoken with dad or step mother since. My step sister (13F) who thought this whole thing was very funny told me that the three of them fought for like half an hour after I left with my mum and the step grandmother left angrily. \n\nWhile my mum insists I did right by standing up for myself, I don't know if I took it too far. I could have just smiled and insisted no without escalating the situation to avoid the conflict.

How is not wanting to go somewhere they wouldn't feel comfortable at an asshole move here? \n\nThey told OP the dress code, OP said thanks but no thanks. Why should OP be required to attend if they don't want to conform to the dress code? If I was told I HAD to attend a party and I HAD to dress a certain way that specifically made me feel uncomfortable I would be pissed.", "Yes but they never forced me to hide my hair and skin. Or wear clothes that gives me body shape. The reason behind the clothes is based on their religion. Not the occasion.", "No. This is what I said:\n\n> I said fine, thanks for the invitation but if I'm not welcome as me then I'll pass.\n\nAnd would have been happy to end things there, but she continued telling me how I have family obligations to do this for her.", "I think most people will agree that saying **Thank you for the invitation,  but If I'm not welcome as me, then I'll pass** was the perfect response for someone demanding their attendance while also demanding they not come as themselves.", "Sounds like they said 'I'm planning on wearing XYZ' since that is normally fine. When it deemed not fine OP said 'Oh ok, then I guess I won't attend'", "I've visited France plenty of times and have family there, they can choose alright.", "No, they're completely different situations. How don't you see this? And how are these women in France and China going to know about OP's clothes?", "Ok, but you're telling OP to basically wear clothing they don't want to in solidarity of those who... also can't? Seems backwards to me. \n\n'Limit your freedom of expression because others are also limited'", "To some extent yeah.", "GM is an adult and should have better emotional regulation than a still developing teen.", "I feel like the father not standing up for her is also a huge red flag that he really would do something horrible in order to control her, or at the very least he would allow it to happen", "Isn't that what they said?", "That does not decrease his obligation to protect his kid", "Given OP's comment at the end of the confrontation (and in the comments here) it didn't seem like the dad was being proud of her. And he hasn't talked to her since, if he was proud he'd have done something to let her know.", "I live in a muslim majority country so I know what modest islamic clothing looks like, but still I stand by my opinion that what OPs step grandmother did/tried to do was disrespectful and bit entitled.", "Yeah that's not what I'd wear and I was happy to decline the invitation.\n\nThe disrespect towards me wasn't the dress code, but everything that followed after me declining the invitation.", "So why do you have to respect the religious culture and not the non-religious culture? \n\nRespect goes both ways and that step grandmother gave absolutely none of it.", "It isn\u2019t though. Clothing is part of the culture and not the religion. Two VERY different things", "Sure you can be pissed. \nNo one is saying you can\u2019t. \n\nBut god if you can\u2019t suck up being pissed or uncomfortable for ONE night. \n\nYou\u2019re the AH", "Exactly", "She said she hasn't spoken to him, not that he hasn't spoken to her. But again not saying he's a bad guy or not just saying without hearing from him we're just guessing", "Forcing someone\\`s religious rules and that \"my way or no way\" attitude is seriously wrong so you have my full support when it comes to the way you handled it.", "In matters of religion, if you give an inch you can be sure a fundie will take a mile.", "The party from the sounds of things was at your own home, it\u2019s not really a choice of I\u2019m going or not. \n\nThere seems to be a lot more missing info around the conversation. \n\nSure there was disrespect on both sides but I think you could have sucked it up for One night.", "The lady even calls it Islamic clothing lol", "First off I'm not OP. Secondly no. OP shouldn't be required to conform to religious and culteral dress they're uncomfortable with. They politely declined the invitation and weren't a brat about it. \n\nIt is worrisome you think this kid should be forced to attend this party.", "It\u2019s a principal when what they\u2019re asking is horribly sexist.", "He hasn't attempted contact. I don't think he's mad at me for standing up but definitely not proud either.", "The party is going to be at step grandmother's house. She is hosting. We don't live with her.", "Islamic culture and Muslim as a religion are two very different things.", "The party is at their house. They are 16 and not an adult. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty common to be dragged into things you don\u2019t want to do as a child and be uncomfortable for a single night.", "I'd say they are different things, but in fundamentalist traditions the two converge. It's dissembling from the main topic, OP doesn't come from a regressive culture and isn't religious. Either this step-grandmother needs to accept that she could push her regressive attitudes or she could have OP's attendance. Old lady chose to be disrespectful.", "What a ludicrously pedantic distinction.", "I'm a child so my actual parents get to drag me into things I might not want to do.\n\nMy step grandmother doesn't.", ">Last night her mother was visiting us for dinner and told us she is throwing a family and friends party and we're all invited\n\nNo, it is at OP's Step Grandmothers house.", "Is it though?\n\nTake religion out of it and it\u2019s a child arguing with their parents for not wanting to go to a family party as they don\u2019t like the dress code for 1 evening.", "This more sounds like you have something against your step mother and her family instead of just this event as an isolated instance so we will leave it at that.", "Actually, this argument was not at all with OP\u2019s parents.\n\nAs for the silly distinction you attempted to make, yes, it\u2019s pedantic. The idea that a hijab isn\u2019t a religious clothing just because it\u2019s not worn in all islamic countries is silly, and false.", "I don't have anything against them, I just don't recognise my step grandmother as my parent because she's not my parent."]}
