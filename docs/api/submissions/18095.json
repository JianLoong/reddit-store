My dad comes from a Muslim background but he's not religious. My mum doesn't come from any religious background and isn't religious either, I'm quite similar to my mum.\n\nMy dad has married my step mother about 3 years ago. She and her side of the family are very religious and quite strict in how they practice. They're very conservative and quite inflexible when it comes to others around them. She's always clashing with me about how my lack of practice reflects poorly on her in her community and how a little effort from me could go a long way in helping our family.\n\nI generally don't give an inch. Obviously needless to say I don't have any problems with religious people (of any religion) and I respect them as long as it's reciprocal and they respect me back. Naturally I also live in this community and most of my friends are from the same background, and we get along perfectly.\n\nLast night her mother was visiting us for dinner and told us she is throwing a family and friends party and we're all invited. But looked at me and said modest Islamic clothing only. I said I'm gonna wear what I typically wear to any family party and she said no she won't allow it in her house. In case you don't know, what she wants are 1) hair covered, 2) not showing any skin apart from face and feet, and 3) clothes to be loose so they wouldn't show body figure.\n\nI said fine, thanks for the invitation but if I'm not welcome as me then I'll pass [edit: and won't come.]\n\nUp until this point it was a polite conversation. But after this she attacked my character and I responded. This is how it went from there, I'll quote directly as best as I can remember:\n\nHer: This is the kind of party where the whole family comes or none of them come. You can be your own person on your own time but you have family obligations too and wouldn't kill you to do it for once in your life.\n\nMe: You have no idea of my obligations or how I handle them, you're out of line and should back off.\n\nHer: And you should respect your religion and elders so if you know what's good for you when I tell you this is what you wear you should say yes.\n\nMe: I don't respect this nonsense. And your party and religion, you know where to shove them.\n\nThen said I've lost my appetite, looked at my dad and told him thanks for standing up for me, and left. I called my mum and she came to pick me up, haven't spoken with dad or step mother since. My step sister (13F) who thought this whole thing was very funny told me that the three of them fought for like half an hour after I left with my mum and the step grandmother left angrily. \n\nWhile my mum insists I did right by standing up for myself, I don't know if I took it too far. I could have just smiled and insisted no without escalating the situation to avoid the conflict.

(And IMO, a lot of people will be well into their adulthood before they can successfully deploy diplomacy while someone is assailing their character.)\n\nBUT. I also was raised to not raise my voice to an elder, even if the elder was flat-out wrong. My mother would have made me apologize and given me an earful if I had addressed a senior citizen like this. \n\nMy thought is that you would be the bigger person if you were to at least apologize for losing your temper at the step-grandmother. I would hope that your parents would at least have your back regarding not forcing you to attend a party where you don't want to be, and I hope you don't find yourself having to spend tons of time in your step-relatives' company. \n\nBut work on that skill of diplomacy. It will serve you well in the short and long run.", "YTA.  She set the terms of attending.  You declined.  She was an AH.  And you upped it by attacking her religion and culture.  If you had simply bowed out before that, you would have retained the high ground.  I doubt you care, but that relationship is tanked forever and your stepmom and her family have ALL the ammunition against you now.  \n\nLots of other teens on here will be all \u201cgo you\u201d and in a story it\u2019s great and empowering.  In real life, maturity and wisdom let\u2019s you win for all time.  Especially if you are all in the same community and it is even mildly religious it will get around to EVERYONE about how you \u201cattacked\u201d their religion.  Saying you didn\u2019t practice the religion would have worked.  But telling her to shove her religion now allows her to present herself as a godly crusader rather than a controlling AH.  \n\nGood luck and I sincerely hope none of your friends are devout.", "YTA and and a disrespectful childish ahole at that.  A grown up would have held their tongue and just not gone to the party.", "Yeah, she was.  I share OP\u2019s stance on this one too. At 16, I don\u2019t think I could have been as measured as her though. Big points in my book.", "He is a Muslim men who had a relationship w/a non Muslim woman. Rarely do these type of men have good opinions so he wouldn\u2019t have defended her", "Probably not bc the dad is a Muslim men who had a relationship w/a non Muslim woman. Those type of men are typically scam", "and op said she wouldn't go. you can't force a guest to come to your party if they aren't comfortable with your rules. NTA", "How is it islamaphobic to not want to be forced to wear Islamic clothing? People can follow whatever religion they want. They second they force it on someone, they become assholes.

And people have a right to not attend.  And yes, she told step grandma to eff off.", "Um...no. Why would Op do that?", "\n\n>You have the luxury of being able to choose how you practice (or don't). Millions upon millions of women don't and they fight every day for this right while they are crushed by authoritarian governments. Would you consider to wear the traditional clothing in solidarity with those women rather than the step grandmother?\n\nwtf are you even talking about? 'oh, you have a choice so you should conform to exactly what step grandma wants in solidarity with those who don't'! what a ridiculous comment.", "You really don't have to. Your religion is yours. If it's not something I agree with, I'm going to be nice but won't respect it.", "If your dad\u2019s not religious why did he marry this person whose family puts in these demands and then hangs you out to dry? Did he say anything? NTA stay away from these people", "The \"if you know what's good for you\" is threatening and disgusting of her.", "You did exactly right. She told you what she expected in her household. You thought about it and declined to attend with those restrictions. That's all she's entitled to. She's not entitled to your compliance or to change you.", "All I'm going to say is don't jump to conclusions.  Yes, he should have stood up for you while you were there.  However, according to your step-sister, your dad, step-mom, and step-grandmother all argued for half an hour before step-grandma left angrily.  I'm thinking (hoping) that he said quite a bit to her after you left.", "The thing is, the SMiL chose to act that way, and is using religion to justify her actions. She\u2019s using religion as a crutch to gain control over OP. Did her religion play a major influence? Yes. But it\u2019s the SMiL who acted and spoke. I am against religion myself, but the way I see it, SMiL is a control freak, and religion is her weapon of choice.", "Babe you might be Islamphobic. Being on the back w/goat might not be indicative of women\u2019s right. It could have been her goat. Ppl in Muslim countries buy/own goat. She could have been from a rural family.

You'll get pulled into a private room, and then you tell them that you're being trafficked for forced marriage.", "Just curious but are you low or non contact with a lot of family? \n\nI always see this suggested over what seems like minor family fights with little context and it makes me wonder if so many people don't try to reconcile.", "I thought it was weird someone so strictly religious would marry a divorced man.

Same thing is happening here if you remove the religion out of it\n\nno, it is not.", "yes. don't dish out what you can't take", "When they go low, I go lower. Pay kindness with kindness & Malice with malice.", "I mean, they aren\u2019t even related. It\u2019s not even grandma, it\u2019s step-grandma. Only been in her life for about 3 years.

There's more of a choice here than you want to see.  She's also probably old enough to have her custody/visitation changed because of this.", "Which is why OP politely declined to go to her house.", "She was in her fathers home and declined the invite. It was after that SGM became belligerent and attacked op.", "Yeah and my culture is \"wear whatever the fuck you want it's not my business\"", "And then it's time for op's mother to return to family court for another hearing at which point this 16 year old tells the judge she doesn't want to stay with dad.
