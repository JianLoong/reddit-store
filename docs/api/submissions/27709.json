You\u2019re allowed to dislike things. But don\u2019t be mean about it, you know? \n4. She had the option of speaking up about it long before it was served because it was a catered event rather than one where she was ordering it off a menu, and because tickets were sold she had to have talked to someone on the phone to get them? Like, she had the option to notify us beforehand that she liked her salmon a certain way vs a newfangled method and no one was rude about it to her when the problem was getting fixed\u2026 multiple times (It also wasn\u2019t anywhere near raw, btw - it had a nice sear, and was just really tender and lovely all throughout).
