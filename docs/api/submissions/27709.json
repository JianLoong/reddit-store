I have a bil who had a plus one added super last minute to a wedding. Like the bride made arrangements to have this girl come maybe a week before the date.

She made such a scene when her appetizer came with cheese on the side. \n\nFor context, my BIL is vegan and he just pushed the cheese on the side. But she wouldn't eat anything if the cheese touched her plate. I felt so bad for the poor waiters who had to deal with her tantrum.
