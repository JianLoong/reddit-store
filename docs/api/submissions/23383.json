You do not owe your mom, or your brother, the entire rest of your life. You are not your brother's keeper.\n\nShould you love him? Sure. Is it fair to hold him responsible for all of his behavior? That depends on how bad his issues ultimately are.\n\nShe has no right to be angry with you for wanting your own life. She has no right to hold you back because she doesn't know how to handle him.\n\nYour brother would benefit from therapy, and probably with living in a home. With help, guidance, and the right structure, he could probably be in a much better position.\n\nEither way, you're 19 years old. NONE of that is your responsibility.\n\nIf your mom won't take responsibility for your brother, she certainly doesn't get to put that on you.", "NTA\n\nYou have been parentified.  You have every right to leave and live your own life.\n\nIf you need a little money, can any of your other three brothers help?  They, at least, should understand better than anyone about getting the hell out of your family home.\n\nIf they can help you out, I suggest leaving ASAP, and not waiting almost three more weeks.  Go now!", "NTA. This is your life, you're young, you're going to college, this is your time to do what you want to do. I understand parents asking for a little help now and then from their children to look after another disabled child, but not forcing them into a full time carer role or negating their childhood as a result.\n\nIf your mum cannot cope with your brother then there's two options, a home, or official carers. She can't expect your life to go on hold inevitably for you to do something that she should be doing. And without sounding rude, I'm sure she still gets her carers allowance with your hard work.\n\nI'm a carer and I saw similar issues with a teenage girl I cared for. Whenever I wasn't there, her older sister was forced to do everything. She had no life, no friends, just had to care for and entertain her sister. She even had to do the night shifts with her before school the next day. As the family didn't speak English, she was also the full time translator for everything. Its not fair and it shouldn't be expected.", "NTA. Reasonable parents with disabled children make forward plans for their care - plans which take into account issues such as behavioural needs (ie, can this person safely stay in the family home as a young adult or not?), the young person\u2019s best interests (ie, what is the best path forward so that this person has the most autonomy/best quality of life possible, given their particular needs), and the fact that parental caregiving usually has an end date (because most young people with a disability will outlive their parents). Thinking about these things was your parents\u2019 job, not yours. It\u2019s not fair or reasonable for you to be expected to mortgage your future to your mother\u2019s insistence that your brother *must* stay in the family home even though that scenario doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s working well for anyone. She and your father have had 18 years to figure this out.", "He\u2019s not your responsibility. Get the money from somewhere else and get out! Your mom made her bed", "NTA - runnnnnnnnnnn and don\u2019t look back.", "Congratulations on getting into college! NTA at all- you\u2019ve spent your whole life so far being groomed into a servant and carer role that you aren\u2019t required to fulfil. Go live your life- when your mother has to face the reality of her son without free labour from you, she might make better choices and she might not. That isn\u2019t your responsibility.", "NTA - You deserve your own life, although I understand your Mom feeling trapped and afraid to be alone. Regardless, she needs to find the proper resources for your brothers care.  Not you.", "NTA.  One of the big responsibilities for parents of disabled children is making sure that their kids receive appropriate care, especially as they become adults.  An appropriate group home for your brother would probably be the best thing for everyone - the group home will help him learn as much independence as possible, and give him as much control of his life as he is able to manage.  It\u2019d mean he got to make choices for himself, instead of being perpetually a child in his parents\u2019 home.  It\u2019d mean that your responsibilities as a sibling would be limited to visiting like you would with any relative, and checking on his welfare after your parents can no longer do so, rather than the daily work of his care.\n\nIt\u2019s a common story for the healthy sibling to be neglected or made into an extra parent, but that doesn\u2019t make it right.", "NTA\n\nGo and be free! And don't feel guilty. You've done a lifetime of penance and have earned the right to enjoy college, get your education on and escape indentured servitude. \n\nYour mom is not doing right by your brother. He needs more help than she can give. And where the hell is your dad in all this? Does he never come back to see his son? \n\nI'm so sorry for how you've been treated. But maybe when mom's on her own, she'll see the need to get outside help. One way or another. \n\nCongratulations!", "First off Congratulations!! That\u2019s awesome you got accepted. \n\nSecondly, talk to your financial aid people about a payment plan, they won\u2019t kick you out day one for not having everything paid for upfront as long as you talk to them about it. They want you there. \n\nThirdly, I take care of my mother. She\u2019s physically disabled. I have been for years. Being a caregiver is very hard, stressful, and down right fucking sucks sometimes. But it was my choice to do so. Being forced to be a caregiver since childhood is unimaginable. NTA. You need to get away and be free. It hurts to think about your mom this way and I know it hurts to think about your mom and brother alone. But, your are your own individual and deserve to live your life. You did not deserve your childhood to be stolen from you. You deserve the chance and opportunity to live your life. Best of luck!!", "Congratulations on college! \n\nMove out. It's not going to get better. Start making the steps to distance yourself, because if you stay everyone will keep expecting you take care of him. 40 years old and still taking care of him,  while never being able to make a life for yourself. \n\nNtA \n\nIgnore the guilt. Its one of the best/ worst weapons that's users use.", "NTA. You deserve to live your life.  You have every right to feel proud of your accomplishments.  You go out there and get your degree and get ready to start a family of your own.  You have earned it.  You just keep dreaming your dreams and meeting those goals you set for yourself.  Congratulations and best of luck to you.", "NTA \n\nHorrible situation to be in and I understand your guilt. It is unfair for your mother to expect you to put your life on hold to look after your brother, ideally it should be a team effort by everyone in the family so that everyone makes sacrifices but not to the point you miss out on experiencing your own life too. Why can't your mother look after your brother too, why was it only on you?", "NTA, get out while you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso sounds like your brother should be in a specialist facility", "Your mother has abused you all your life by parentifying you and laying a burden on you that you should never have borne. It's time to break free and live your life.\n\nOn top of that, how does she even expect you to take care of your brother long-term if you don't get an education and work experience? What does she think will happen when she's gone if you have no means to earn a living? \n\nIf you go to college and get yourself well-established in life, then you COULD, if you so choose, help out financially to make sure your brother gets good care. You are under no obligation to do that, and your mother certainly doesn't deserve it, but if you still feel some tie to your brother (who can't help his disability) you could potentially do him far more good by building a stable career for yourself. It's time to think long-term.", "Nta at all, time for you to live your life. Congratulations on getting accepted", "NTA, but you know that. If your mom cannot handle her son on her own he needs to go to a halfway home or other specialized care. None of this is your responsibility.\n\nGood luck on college.", "Thank you.

I am worried about my mom and my brother, but I just can\u2019t stay my entire life to take care of him", "Thank you", "Because you were (wrongly) taught that it was your job to take care of your brother and make life easier on your mother.  \n\n\nI get it... I lived it...

I don't think you're an AH for not wanting to put your entire life on hold indefinitely to care for your brother.", "honestly? steal the fucking $200 from your mother. she owes you a shitton, a SHITTON.

I get you feel guilty you want to help, but at a certain point you have to realize there is only so much you can do, before they need outside of family help. He still lives with me, we are trying to adjust his meds, therapy, etc, but it doesn't sound like your parents are doing everything that they can. They aren't helping him, they are hurting him", "NTA\n\nGo and live your life, not hers. \n\nShe is a big girl and now she gets to put on her big girl pants. Her disabled son = her responsibility.\n\nDo not feel ashamed or let the guilt get to you. Both belongs only with her. \n\nAnd I bet you she is suddenly going to make arrangements like putting your brother in a home to recieve care.

Maybe your older siblings can help you?", "Eh, if OP is in the US, there is no carer\u2019s allowance in most of the country, and it\u2019s very limited where it does exist - a parent or spouse typically can\u2019t get it here.  I sure wish there was, because I\u2019d love to have help around the house brought in, but I don\u2019t qualify for anything despite being severely disabled because I got married.  Husband has a good job, but not really enough for us to have the 15-20 hours worth of help every week that I had before we married.\n\nI agree with everything else you\u2019ve said, though.", "I agree. They pay her with housing and food?? She's their kid!!! Housing and free food is the minimum.", "I hadn\u2019t heard that one, but oof, I feel it.  I left for college young, and my sister\u2019s mental illness started really making itself known around the time I left, though it took years for her to be correctly diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD).  I learned pretty quickly how to find services and resources for myself, because my mom\u2019s whole attention was devoted to keeping my sister as stable as possible for about a decade and a half.  In that time, I had fairly severe trouble with my own mental illness (bipolar and PTSD) and rather suddenly became physically disabled due to illness, and my mom was just\u2026not there.  Didn\u2019t even see when I was struggling, because my sister took everything she had.", "NTA.

Congratulations!!!! Second don\u2019t feel bad your brother is not your responsibility it\u2019s hers", "NTA - There's a reasons group homes exist, and frankly sometimes institutions are necessary. You need to live your own life.", "Nta", "NTA. You have a right to your own life and it sounds like staying would pretty much be giving up on that.

My MIL stayed home with him, but as she got older, she became more frail and was unable to control him when he got wild. The best thing that happened to him was that he did eventually go to a group home. My husband did the leg work on that because there was no way we could house or care for him with our kids.  At the group home, he finally got his meds regularly, on schedule. His meals were better nutritionally. He had activities to keep him engaged and occupied. All of this has helped with his behavior. His mom was able to live her last few years for herself,  knowing her son was well cared for.  I feel like for some, caring for a disabled child becomes part of their identity.
