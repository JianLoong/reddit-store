You do not owe your mom, or your brother, the entire rest of your life. You are not your brother's keeper.\n\nShould you love him? Sure. Is it fair to hold him responsible for all of his behavior? That depends on how bad his issues ultimately are.\n\nShe has no right to be angry with you for wanting your own life. She has no right to hold you back because she doesn't know how to handle him.\n\nYour brother would benefit from therapy, and probably with living in a home. With help, guidance, and the right structure, he could probably be in a much better position.\n\nEither way, you're 19 years old. NONE of that is your responsibility.\n\nIf your mom won't take responsibility for your brother, she certainly doesn't get to put that on you.", "NTA\n\nYou have been parentified.  You have every right to leave and live your own life.\n\nIf you need a little money, can any of your other three brothers help?  They, at least, should understand better than anyone about getting the hell out of your family home.\n\nIf they can help you out, I suggest leaving ASAP, and not waiting almost three more weeks.  Go now!", "NTA. This is your life, you're young, you're going to college, this is your time to do what you want to do. I understand parents asking for a little help now and then from their children to look after another disabled child, but not forcing them into a full time carer role or negating their childhood as a result.\n\nIf your mum cannot cope with your brother then there's two options, a home, or official carers. She can't expect your life to go on hold inevitably for you to do something that she should be doing. And without sounding rude, I'm sure she still gets her carers allowance with your hard work.\n\nI'm a carer and I saw similar issues with a teenage girl I cared for. Whenever I wasn't there, her older sister was forced to do everything. She had no life, no friends, just had to care for and entertain her sister. She even had to do the night shifts with her before school the next day. As the family didn't speak English, she was also the full time translator for everything. Its not fair and it shouldn't be expected.", "NTA. Reasonable parents with disabled children make forward plans for their care - plans which take into account issues such as behavioural needs (ie, can this person safely stay in the family home as a young adult or not?), the young person\u2019s best interests (ie, what is the best path forward so that this person has the most autonomy/best quality of life possible, given their particular needs), and the fact that parental caregiving usually has an end date (because most young people with a disability will outlive their parents). Thinking about these things was your parents\u2019 job, not yours. It\u2019s not fair or reasonable for you to be expected to mortgage your future to your mother\u2019s insistence that your brother *must* stay in the family home even though that scenario doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s working well for anyone. She and your father have had 18 years to figure this out.", "He\u2019s not your responsibility. Get the money from somewhere else and get out! Your mom made her bed", "NTA - runnnnnnnnnnn and don\u2019t look back.", "Congratulations on getting into college! NTA at all- you\u2019ve spent your whole life so far being groomed into a servant and carer role that you aren\u2019t required to fulfil. Go live your life- when your mother has to face the reality of her son without free labour from you, she might make better choices and she might not. That isn\u2019t your responsibility.", "NTA - You deserve your own life, although I understand your Mom feeling trapped and afraid to be alone. Regardless, she needs to find the proper resources for your brothers care.  Not you.", "NTA.  One of the big responsibilities for parents of disabled children is making sure that their kids receive appropriate care, especially as they become adults.  An appropriate group home for your brother would probably be the best thing for everyone - the group home will help him learn as much independence as possible, and give him as much control of his life as he is able to manage.  It\u2019d mean he got to make choices for himself, instead of being perpetually a child in his parents\u2019 home.  It\u2019d mean that your responsibilities as a sibling would be limited to visiting like you would with any relative, and checking on his welfare after your parents can no longer do so, rather than the daily work of his care.\n\nIt\u2019s a common story for the healthy sibling to be neglected or made into an extra parent, but that doesn\u2019t make it right.", "NTA\n\nGo and be free! And don't feel guilty. You've done a lifetime of penance and have earned the right to enjoy college, get your education on and escape indentured servitude. \n\nYour mom is not doing right by your brother. He needs more help than she can give. And where the hell is your dad in all this? Does he never come back to see his son? \n\nI'm so sorry for how you've been treated. But maybe when mom's on her own, she'll see the need to get outside help. One way or another. \n\nCongratulations!", "First off Congratulations!! That\u2019s awesome you got accepted. \n\nSecondly, talk to your financial aid people about a payment plan, they won\u2019t kick you out day one for not having everything paid for upfront as long as you talk to them about it. They want you there. \n\nThirdly, I take care of my mother. She\u2019s physically disabled. I have been for years. Being a caregiver is very hard, stressful, and down right fucking sucks sometimes. But it was my choice to do so. Being forced to be a caregiver since childhood is unimaginable. NTA. You need to get away and be free. It hurts to think about your mom this way and I know it hurts to think about your mom and brother alone. But, your are your own individual and deserve to live your life. You did not deserve your childhood to be stolen from you. You deserve the chance and opportunity to live your life. Best of luck!!", "Congratulations on college! \n\nMove out. It's not going to get better. Start making the steps to distance yourself, because if you stay everyone will keep expecting you take care of him. 40 years old and still taking care of him,  while never being able to make a life for yourself. \n\nNtA \n\nIgnore the guilt. Its one of the best/ worst weapons that's users use.", "NTA. You deserve to live your life.  You have every right to feel proud of your accomplishments.  You go out there and get your degree and get ready to start a family of your own.  You have earned it.  You just keep dreaming your dreams and meeting those goals you set for yourself.  Congratulations and best of luck to you.", "NTA \n\nHorrible situation to be in and I understand your guilt. It is unfair for your mother to expect you to put your life on hold to look after your brother, ideally it should be a team effort by everyone in the family so that everyone makes sacrifices but not to the point you miss out on experiencing your own life too. Why can't your mother look after your brother too, why was it only on you?", "NTA, get out while you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso sounds like your brother should be in a specialist facility", "Your mother has abused you all your life by parentifying you and laying a burden on you that you should never have borne. It's time to break free and live your life.\n\nOn top of that, how does she even expect you to take care of your brother long-term if you don't get an education and work experience? What does she think will happen when she's gone if you have no means to earn a living? \n\nIf you go to college and get yourself well-established in life, then you COULD, if you so choose, help out financially to make sure your brother gets good care. You are under no obligation to do that, and your mother certainly doesn't deserve it, but if you still feel some tie to your brother (who can't help his disability) you could potentially do him far more good by building a stable career for yourself. It's time to think long-term.", "Nta at all, time for you to live your life. Congratulations on getting accepted", "NTA, but you know that. If your mom cannot handle her son on her own he needs to go to a halfway home or other specialized care. None of this is your responsibility.\n\nGood luck on college.", "Thank you. It just makes me feel a bit guilty \u2764\ufe0f", "Thank you", "Thank you", "I know the term glass child is popular, when a child is kinda looked through / over", "My mother I guess was just very tired from taking care of 5 kids. But I don\u2019t wanna give her a lot of excuses because she treated me rather horribly", "Thank you. I am worried about my mom and my brother, but I just can\u2019t stay my entire life to take care of him", "Thank you", "Because you were (wrongly) taught that it was your job to take care of your brother and make life easier on your mother.  \n\n\nI get it... I lived it... I'm about three decades past where you are right now, and I am telling you that the guilt is a lie.", "the main responsibility for caring for your brother lies with the parents, then afterwards it is your responsibility. I don't think you're an AH for not wanting to put your entire life on hold indefinitely to care for your brother.", "honestly? steal the fucking $200 from your mother. she owes you a shitton, a SHITTON. NTA and get far far away from her.", "He\u2019s her kid not yours. You\u2019ve got your own life to live. It sucks for her but it\u2019s still her responsibility.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEscape your abusive mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet out, or you will end up without any education, and as the livelong caretaker of your brother.", "NTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Nta- as someone who has an autistic younger brother, that is 6'5 , 350, football player, and gets aggressive during outbursts. I get you feel guilty you want to help, but at a certain point you have to realize there is only so much you can do, before they need outside of family help. He still lives with me, we are trying to adjust his meds, therapy, etc, but it doesn't sound like your parents are doing everything that they can. They aren't helping him, they are hurting him", "NTA\n\nGo and live your life, not hers. \n\nShe is a big girl and now she gets to put on her big girl pants. Her disabled son = her responsibility.\n\nDo not feel ashamed or let the guilt get to you. Both belongs only with her. \n\nAnd I bet you she is suddenly going to make arrangements like putting your brother in a home to recieve care. Funny how things suddenly get done when you no longer can abuse someone.", "NTA\n\n And good luck in your life. Make sure your mother can't get a hold of your documents and hide everything. Maybe your older siblings can help you?", "Eh, if OP is in the US, there is no carer\u2019s allowance in most of the country, and it\u2019s very limited where it does exist - a parent or spouse typically can\u2019t get it here.  I sure wish there was, because I\u2019d love to have help around the house brought in, but I don\u2019t qualify for anything despite being severely disabled because I got married.  Husband has a good job, but not really enough for us to have the 15-20 hours worth of help every week that I had before we married.\n\nI agree with everything else you\u2019ve said, though.", "I agree. They pay her with housing and food?? She's their kid!!! Housing and free food is the minimum.", "I hadn\u2019t heard that one, but oof, I feel it.  I left for college young, and my sister\u2019s mental illness started really making itself known around the time I left, though it took years for her to be correctly diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD).  I learned pretty quickly how to find services and resources for myself, because my mom\u2019s whole attention was devoted to keeping my sister as stable as possible for about a decade and a half.  In that time, I had fairly severe trouble with my own mental illness (bipolar and PTSD) and rather suddenly became physically disabled due to illness, and my mom was just\u2026not there.  Didn\u2019t even see when I was struggling, because my sister took everything she had.", "NTA. One thing is to expect help in families, one thing is to ruin someone's future because you want free help h24. Your siblings did the right thing and you should follow their example", "First! Congratulations!!!! Second don\u2019t feel bad your brother is not your responsibility it\u2019s hers", "NTA - There's a reasons group homes exist, and frankly sometimes institutions are necessary. You need to live your own life.", "Nta", "NTA. You have a right to your own life and it sounds like staying would pretty much be giving up on that. Your mom might get it after you leave, in which case you can patch things up, or she might not, in which case she's made her choice and can live by that. But you live by yours.", "NTA, run and never look back.", "You know you are NTA, but when you need any more validation I'm more then willing to give it to you, because you haven't got enough in your life...\n\n>I once promised her I\u2019d never leave but I can\u2019t be here anymore. \n\nYou are only 19, and back then you where a minor... Promise yourself you will be there for yourself.\n\n>my parents didn\u2019t allow me to have a job because they would joke about how my job is taking care of my brother. And how they pay me in free food and free housing.\n\nThis is so awful. They decided to have kids, they decided to have you. And they needed to provide for you. This is abusive. I hope you can heal from this and learn that the love between parents and kids is unconditional... Or should be.\n\n>My other siblings left the moment they turned 18 cause they couldn\u2019t deal with the abuse from disabled brother\n\n... and the abuse from your mother. Don't judge them, they did the right thing.\n\nMaybe get into contact with your father. He is probably painted all bad for leaving, but it is your mother who is not open to any other solution and who seems to consider the people in her life more for the part they can play in the dare of your brother.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother should be looking into home care options for your brother. This is why you and the rest of your immediate family left your mother. You have to live your life because your upset already about losing out on so much.\n\nYou\u2019re NOT responsible for your brother. Your mother will figure things out. DO NOT ALLOW HER TO GUILT YOU INTO RUINING YOUR LIFE!\n\nCongratulations and Good Luck!", "NTA\nGet to school, get with financial aid and do what is necessary to be an independent student (there are hoops to jump through but do it), get into therapy ( it will help with the guilt and work through the past ).  \nAlso, to help your guilt (and your brother and mother) report to Adult Social Services the situation and your Mom needs help.  They should be able to help them.  Sounds like your Mom has no idea there is outside help available or is ashamed/embarrassed for whatever reason. \n\nGood Luck in school", "NTA 5 children is a lot. Having one child is a gamble as it is. She and your father are the true AHs. They\u2019re the ones who signed up for parenthood and all its responsibilities, including the possibility of a profoundly disabled child. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re fleeing the abuse. Don\u2019t look back.", "You promised not to leave when you were a child and you definitely should not be pressed into staying, it's absolutely NTA for working hard to get a better life for yourself. An independent life at that.", "Your siblings flew the coop. You deserve no less.", "100%. It's OP's mom who isn't doing the right thing here \u2014 for OP, for OP's brother, and maybe even herself. She'll have to come to terms with that eventually, and OP shouldn't pause his life just to delay the inevitable for her.", "NTA.\nIt's ok to feel sad about your brother and your mom's situation.  It'd be inhuman not to.\n\nThe guilt however, is not yours to bear. All the best in college and beyond.", "Sorry I wasn't aware that carers allowance wasn't a thing in the US as I'm from the UK and we have it here, even for parents/spouses. It's not fair that you don't qualify for any extra help.", "Why\u2019d she have five kids?", "Yeah, it\u2019s not like getting married made me suddenly able to do things like the laundry - my joints were just as fucked up the day after I got married as they were the day before.  But the dumb, unfair expectation in the US is that you\u2019re responsible for caring for your children and/or your spouse unless you\u2019re well below the poverty level.  I only had the assistance I had before we married because I had no legal income, I was living on student loans.  Loss of benefits (healthcare, some types of income, and carers) prevents a lot of disabled from getting married."]}
