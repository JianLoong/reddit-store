{"id": 154, "submission_id": "yiy8aa", "title": "AITA for being upset that someone is naming their kid after my recently deceased father?", "selftext": "AITA?  \nMy dad died this past May after an extremely long battle with lung disease, a lung transplant, and the complications of the transplant (he died almost 2 years after receiving the transplant). There was a lot of suffering, both mentally and physically, experienced by my dad of course but also my mom/sisters/myself. I won\u2019t go into detail, but the last two years have been extremely challenging for us all.\n\nMy dad had a sister, and they are estranged. I could not recognize her passing in the street, and they have probably spoken less than 5-10 times in the 30 years I\u2019ve been alive. His sister has two kids, a son and daughter, both older than I am. The only time the son has \u2019shown\u2019 up in our lives is when he called our house to ask my dad for money. Writing this post, I can\u2019t even remember what his name is. The daughter friended me on Facebook years ago and did occasionally ask me how my dad was when he was at his sickest (mostly to share with her mom). My dad\u2019s sister, her daughter, and her daughter\u2019s kids showed up to my older sister\u2019s wedding in 2013 - they sat in the car during the outdoor ceremony (the weather was beautiful) and left immediately after. That was the first/last time we saw them, and the first/last time my parents saw the little kids. They did not come to my wedding. (We invited them out of respect and not wanting to exclude any of my dad\u2019s few relatives).\n\nTonight, the daughter messaged me on Facebook to tell me that her daughter is having another baby boy, and that the baby\u2019s middle name will be my dad\u2019s first name. I\u2019m devastated. We would not recognize these people passing in the street. My dad would recognize his sister, but not his niece/her kids. They have had nothing to do with us and vice versa. Aside from the wedding, the only contact they\u2019ve made is when asking for money or gifts. They didn\u2019t send a card when he died, much less call. My older sister thinks this is a roundabout way to get us to send money/gifts to them, but I wouldn\u2019t give them that much credit IMO.\n\nI replied to her message with \u201cThat is an interesting choice to make, seeing as how my dad does not know you or your children and vice versa.\u201d She has not seen/responded.\n\nI realize I can\u2019t force them to change the name, but IMO it\u2019s ridiculous/bizarre to name a whole ass child after someone you do not know and who meant nothing to you, and disrespectful/clueless to message me and tell me as if I should be happy about this. I also feel robbed of the ability to honor my OWN DAD by naming a future child after him (married, no kids yet). what do you all think?", "created_utc": 1667275386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiy8aa/aita_for_being_upset_that_someone_is_naming_their/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're experiencing profound grief over the death of your beloved dad. But honestly I'm going to have to go with gentle YTA. You don't know why they chose to name their baby's middle name after your dad. It could be as your sis said for gifts/money, or perhaps attention, but it could be that they wanted to honor your dad in a small way.  Your response, while understandable, was rude. Its only a middle name. You're still able to name your child after your dad, esp since you'll likely remain almost NC with these people. Please just ignore all this, you have more important things in life.", "I am so sorry for your family's loss and all the difficulties you've gone through, so I hate to say it but, YTA.  You have absolutely no control over what someone chooses as a middle name for their child, so why add to the terrible emotional burden you are dealing with by being angry over this?  If you truly have no interest in dealing with these people and don't want to hear other news from them that might upset you, unfriend them and forget about them.  \n\nIf you are going to dwell on this, first ask yourself - is your dad's name a family name?  Was he named after his dad, his grandfather, or an uncle?  If it is a name that runs in the family and your dad isn't the only one who ever had this name, then you really don't have a right to be angry if someone else in your family uses it, whether you like them or not.  And did she say specifically that she was using your dad's name in honor or because of your dad?  Maybe your cousin's daughter just likes that name.  Or it is a common name in her husband's family.  Remember that unless your dad's name is totally unique, there are thousands or millions of men that have your Dad's name as either their first or second name.  Does that bother you as well?\n\n Regardless, this has no bearing on your ability to use his name for one of your children.    When you have a child, name him after your dad.  And remember that he is the only child named after your dad that is directly descended from your dad.  And every time you look at him you will see that common DNA somewhere.  In the twinkle in his eye or the dimple in his cheek.  Move on from your extended family drama.  You have far more important things to do with your life.", "Mild YTA. Just let it go, man.\n\nAnd go ahead and name your future child after him. No rule against that.", "YTA \n\nI am sorry for the loss of your dad, however you have no say on how anyone names their child plus its just a middle name. You still can honor your father by naming your future LO after him. She gave you the courtesy of letting you know and she didn't even have to do that.", "Soft YTA or NAH\n\nTotally understand why this stings. Your heart's been ripped out and you're grieving. My heart goes out to you. \n\nThese people may regret that your Dad and his sister had a falling out and maybe this is their way of showing that despite that bitter history, they still want to remember your Dad. I think the mistake they made was telling you about it. That seems unnecessary and demonstrates poor judgement with respect to what sounds like complex, historical family politics. \n\nHowever, as you say yourself, you don't know these people. You're unlikely to come across them in your day to day life so it should have no impact on names for any of your potential future children. It would be like a stranger who happened to choose the same name. \n\nAnybody who knows you will understand the significance of the name when/if you use it for your kids. Most importantly, YOU will know the significance and this cannot be diluted, no matter who else uses it.", "Why are you letting them inhabit valuable real estate in your head? They've been entirely irrelevant, so what does it *really* matter? Evict them from your mind and continue to let them drift away in their own ignorance. Live your life, honoring your father as you see fit. What they do won't make any difference to that. YWBTA if you let them bug you, or if you keep responding. \n\nLife is too short to spend any effort on idiots like these.", "NAH so long as you keep your feelings to yourself. You have the right to feel however you feel, but it's foolish at best. This did absolutely nothing to your ability to name a child for your father someday. It has nothing to do with you. It has only to do with whatever relationship the parent had or wishes they had with the bearer of the name... and you don't get to judge that. Even if the relationship was all in her head, it might be that your father was important to her for reasons we can't even guess at. \n\nIt's just not your business. And it doesn't affect you in the least. So please don't cut off your nose to spite your face by deciding that you can't name a child that after she's stolen the name, or tainted it, or whatever it is you feel she's doing.", "INFO - was you dad named for a relative?\n\n>robbed of the ability to honor my OWN DAD by naming a future child after him\n\nWhy do you care if your child shares a name with a child you will likely never meet?", "Is it a family name?", "It is completely understandable why it bothers you that strangers use your father's name.\n\nBut don't worry, because they are strange people, you can use your father's name without worrying that another family member has the same name. No one will know that child, not even your children.", "NTA\n\nYou're allowed to feel however you feel.  As you said, you can't force them to change it.   You made your opinion known.\n\nDo not let this in any way prevent you from naming a future child after your father.", "NAH\u2026 but you\u2019re close. No one owns a name and you don\u2019t have a relationship with them. You make it very clear you wouldn\u2019t recognize these people if you saw them so in the grand scheme of things this doesn\u2019t even matter.", "Oh love. You lost your dad only a few months ago - your grief is understandably raw and enormous. You aren\u2019t the A H for having strong feelings about your cousin\u2019s name choice- when we\u2019re grieving, everything hits harder. You\u2019ve already lost someone you love - this can feel like you\u2019re losing the chance to honor your dad yourself in the future. \n\nBut there\u2019s nothing lost here. Let your extended fam do their thing - it doesn\u2019t sound like your lives intersect that often anyway. Whatever their motives are, it doesn\u2019t stop you from eventually finding your own way to honor your father (I don\u2019t personally believe in burdening kids with the names of family members who have passed because it\u2019s a lot to live up to, but each to their own.)\n\nNTA - Hugs from this Internet stranger.", "NTA for being upset or for what you said, but in no way does this rob you of the ability to name your potential kid after your dad.  It's not like you're ever going to see these people again.  And even if you do they're using your dad's name as a middle name so it's not like there will be two Pauls or Mikes running around.", "NAH. I understand grief, believe me. so I get you're angry that they weren't around, but it is an overreaction about the name. There isn't a reason that you still can't name one of your future children after him still. It's not a race that whoever gets pregnant first gets the rights to the name. Take a step back and ask yourself how their decision will impact your day to day life. Ask yourself: if you barely have contact with them anyway, then why does their decision matter so much? And after that, if you're still angry, then it might be worth looking into grief counseling to help with your process.", "NAH. Sounds like you're grieving still, but you don't own this name. You say you're not even close to them, so stop letting it bother you so much. And feeling \"robbed\" of being able to name your hypothetical kid that is irrational. Names aren't a finite resource.", "NTA. I fully understand why you're u would feel this way. It feels like people who didn't even know/care about your dad stole something from you. I will say you can still go or your dad when you decide to have kids. Just use his first or middle name as a first name. Your kid will just know they're named after a family member who loves them and that's enough.", "YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
