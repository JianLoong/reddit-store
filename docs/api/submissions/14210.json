My dad has always taught me AND my brother's to lock the doors", "It depends, some places can have a  pretty creative set up that makes it hard to find it. Most thieves won't waste a lot of time. For my front door I used to hide a key in the shed around the house, you had to go through the fence which used a latch which is a pain in the butt if you didn't know how to open it, then get into the shed using another hide a key which was located elsewhere in the yard. Most thieves won't waste a lot of time hunting for all of that.", "The door code for sure my sister has one and has used it to generate a temporary code for guests, it's a feature on the one she has. But I all you need is either the code or your phone to unlock the door.", "That\u2019s what I was going to say. I have that and it\u2019s fantastic.", "i once made my own, found a nice rock and super glued the cap of an old pill bottle to it and then put the key in the bottle, twist on the top and shove in the ground", "Could hide a mechanical key safe in the garden\n\nhttps://www.argos.co.uk/product/8033653", "I've had one for years and only replaced the batteries once.

A copy of the key is buried on the property. We can get to it even in winter but it kinda sucks. Better than being locked out but pretty darn secure.", "I got one that also has a keyhole and a spare key if the battery dies.", "We have a keypad lock on our front door, but we also have a keypad for the garage door hooked into our electric system and a key hidden inside the garage. So even if the battery dies we can still get in through the garage.", "Or someone hacking/reprogramming it.

And usually when sleeping but not always.", "Well, I would just leave it as \u201cbig city\u201d. Many people in rural areas do not lock their doors lol.", "That would very much be true also. In small town Canada if you're just across the street or walking your dog through the neighbourhood people will often leave their doors unlocked.", "Living in an apartment building is the only time I leave my door unlocked when I'm home. Probably because there's already a lock just to get on the property and I end up going in and out so much for things like laundry. When I've lived in houses, the door is always locked.", "I'm in a city and do this during the day, but at night? We have well documented, un-caught prowlers in the neighborhood. Leaving your doors unlocked at night here is asking for severe trouble", "Men don't have to think about personal safety as much as other folks (generally). The issue is he doesn't respect her wants and needs. Why would you continue to do something that makes your partner feel vulnerable?", "It is a safety habit. She\u2019s just clear that rationally, she\u2019s okay with *sometimes* leaving the door unlocked. Nonetheless, locking the door is ABSOLUTELY a safety habit. Just like putting on your seatbelt is a safety habit, even if you\u2019re fine with not wearing a seatbelt when you move the cars around in the driveway. \n\nThey both have habits that may be hard to unlearn. Either he puts a key in the running belt he already wears and never has to think about it again, or she has to unlearn a habit and then every time she goes out or showers or goes to bed she has to think about and check all the doors. Maybe she\u2019s a teeny-tiny bit selfish wanting him to bend on this, but nowhere near the level he is. He needs a one-time one-minute effort to change this with zero other implications.", "I'm just imagining a criminal getting all excited because someone laid out a scavenger hunt for him to break in.

That can leave a lot of clues.", "In the house I grew up, there was a little ledge/sill under the window by the back door. You would never know it was a bit loose. Not enough to come off, but enough to hide a key under it between the ledge and the brick.  That's where the spare key was. You literally would have had to know looking at it. None of the other ledges lifted at all.", "You reminded me of my late grandmother.  You went to the post with the ivy that was between her and her neighbor's house to the east. Pick up the gardening trowel that she left hanging there, 3 steps north, 2 steps east and under about 1\" of dirt is a small pickling jar that had her key in there.  She also had a habit of murdering her mowers, so there was always coverage for the small hole so it didn't stick out.\n\nEdit to say, that was just her spare key in case she locked herself out or family came and she wasn't home yet", "I\u2019m not in the US so relevant", "Almost every smart lock on the market can be powered from the outside by either a 9v or a portable battery charger.", "There is definitely not a way to replace the battery from the outside on mine. But when the battery starts to die the lock sounds slower so you know that you need to replace soon (as in within the next few months, not days).", "Yes.\n\nI\u2019m confused. Why would you leave the doors unlocked if the residents are inside?", "It happens way more often than anyone wants to think. It's just not worth the risk imo.", "It can be a safety habit, for some people, sure.  But in this instance it's clearly not, and suggesting otherwise is just arguing in bad faith.  It's not something that can be interpretable.", ">Plenty of places pretty much are yes, outside of bad areas. I don't lock the door when home alone in the UK and honestly, nor do most people I know. There's no real danger to it here. My fianc\u00e9 is adorably paranoid as he's American and got so weirded out that I didn't when he went to work and I told him that there's no reason to here, especially in the neighbourhood he lives in.\n\nAlso in the UK, living in a nice area, wouldn't dream of leaving an external door unlocked unless I was right there, eg working in the kitchen with the back door open next to me.\nDon't know anyone that does leave doors unlocked other than by accident.\nKnow of lots of incidents where burglars have just walked in people's home's off the street though, both at night and during the day.", "Some. I wouldn't say \"almost every.\"\n\nMany go with a physical key as the backup, instead.", "That is exactly the reason why I lock my doors whenever I'm home. Why risk it?", "Do you know how ridiculously easy it is to break into most locked houses?\n\nIt's a gesture at best, unless you also have locked all the windows and are sure the lock can't be popped.\n\nMy ex showed me when I locked us out one day. He was like... \"Here are the first five ways I'd get in.\"  It was eye opening.", "You do know how ridiculiusly improbable it is that you would be murdered by a serial killer right?", "Have you ever lived in the Midwest? It\u2019s super common to leave your doors unlocked. You get a couple hours away from cities and people don\u2019t lock their cars or houses even when they\u2019re not home.", "I have neighbors who are always around, 3 firefighters and a police officer.  I have had people just walk into my house if left unlocked. Not to do bad stuff, but because they are delivering something, or can't tell it is a single family house. My daughter was once surprised by a guy looking around for another door while in our entry-way. He just made a mistake, but it freaked her out.  I automatically lock my doors whether I am here or not.", "Because it's day time. And we're both home. I'm also confused here. We have a dog we walk 4-5 times a day. We go into our yard between work meetings. We check the mail. We're in and out.

Members of my family work in the building trade... lots of call outs to upgrade/replace locks after burglaries achieved by using unlocked doors or open windows.", "I lock up in the afternoon/evening, but certainly am blessed to live in a safe area. I've even accidentally left my wallet on my passenger seat with the car doors unlocked overnight without an incident. Obviously, these are risks I wouldn't take in other areas, but it's nice to know I can get by in the suburbs without hypervigilance.", "Lived in Michigan my whole life. Probably 50% of my friends and family never lock their houses and 80-90% don\u2019t lock them when they\u2019re home.
