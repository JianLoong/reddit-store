The problem is that both grad schools I got accepted to either don't recommend working full time or flat out say it's impossible to do so. The programs are both under 2 years and require hundreds of hours at clinical placements in order to graduate.

I currently work part time and other than being on their insurance, I don't have them pay anything for me (i pay my own groceries, gas, tuition, etc.). I have no issue working part time but I really don't want to stretch myself too thin by taking on a full time job while juggling school, clinicals, and a potential GA position. I did the math based off the school websites and saw that approx. 60-70 hours a week would be dedicated to attending classes, doing schoolwork, and going to clinicals. 40 hours a week for a full time job (and approx 60 hours for sleep) would leave absolutely no time to do anything else.

I just completed my master\u2019s course that was to be done in 15 months. I did it in 18 months. I was going to school full time AND working full time. If had the ability to not work to focus fully on school, I would have. Your mom is full of shit. You have to do what is best for you, academically, emotionally, etc. Because at the end of the day, it\u2019s not her life, it\u2019s yours.", "NTA but if she wants you to have \u201cfreedom\u201d from having to tell her what you\u2019re doing\u2026 why does she make you tell her in the first place?", "Thank you. I feel like I'm going crazy listening to her say this. I don't know anyone who has worked full time and went to school full time actually recommending it - only doing it because they absolutely had to", "It's not necessarily her, it's my dad that does that"]}
