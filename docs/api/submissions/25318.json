But I have a feeling she's been your emotional support person for too long and has bailed you out of similar situations in the past. This may have been the last straw.\n\nI've had friends in the past constantly relied on me for emotional support without asking how I am or how I'm feeling and you get to a point where it becomes draining. I have a feeling this is the situation here.\n\nAlso that was probably traumatic for her too. If she's a genuine friend it probably wasn't easy for her to see if you in that state and maybe needs time to process it too. And the fact that you rang and immediately asked about yourself then asked if she was OK probably didn't help either.\n\nI know you wanted to know what happened and that's OK but I feel like you may need to reflect on your actions throughout the friendship and see if there's something deeper going on.\n\nI don't think there is an asshole here. Just a shitty situation.", "I think there is more to this story, sorry O.P. I am sorry you got drugged at a club. I would suggest not going back with out friend in toe.

You have no idea what happened once you passed out, and your friend had to take care of you while hoping nothing bad happens to you. Both of you need to step back for a moment and talk about it. Both of you went through a very scary situation, and none of you know how to deal with it.", "NTA. You needed help and she rescued you from a dangerous situation but it sounds like she's feeling overburdened and feels you're relying on her too much. Some people need space from certain people but that doesn't necessarily mean they hate you or want to get rid of you. She might just have too much on her plate right now and can't be the one to pick you up every time you fall down emotionally.", "NTA.  I'm glad nothing happened to you.  Please think about this, you can't be too mad at her, she did come to your rescue, if she were a true AH she would not have picked you up.\n\nBe safe, there are some scary people out there.  There is safety in numbers, when you go clubbing, go with friends so you all can look out for each other.   If one of you go to the bathroom, the others will watch the drinks.  Only accept drinks from the bartender, especially if you are out solo.", "NTA - You needed her help. If she really just wanted some space why can\u2018t she just simply tell you so? Ghosting is not the right way to tell you that imo.", "NAH, while her reaction isn't what I'd be expecting from a best friend, she might have been in a bad spot mentally herself, but she didn't leave you hanging. Plus, she was being open about being irrationally annoyed, which imho is a basis to work on together and talk it out. \nYou are NTA, because I don't see how it would be wrong to turn towards somebody you trust when caught up in this situation.", "NTA OP, people who aren\u2019t good at communicating their feelings shouldn\u2019t feel angry at you because we\u2019re not mind readers; that\u2019s not how communication works!!!", "Ugh I\u2019m gonna get down voted for this buuutttt\n\nYTA.

You clearly needed rescue and you're lucky to have gotten out. Nothing wrong there.

But thats just a guess", "NTA\n\nYou were in crisis, and quite honestly,  I don't care about whatever self-centered indulgence spiral she is in. The only thing any friend could do is help someone in your situation. Many total strangers would assist anyone they encountered in that situation. For her to follow up the situation where you were victimized in a really terrifying way with a week of no contact is pretty crappy. She's choosing to make it about her feelings when an actual friend would be concerned about you. Is she always an emotional black hole?", "If that\u2019s how your \u201cbest friend\u201d treats you, you need better friends. That\u2019s not a \u201cbest friend\u201d.", "NTA, she doesn't sound like a very good best friend.", "NTA\n\nYou dump out emotionally, not in. Yes it was probably scary for her, but *you* were the one who got drugged. It's not for her to put the weight of her stuff from that night on you. Ignoring you entirely after that, especially when you were asking what even happened, was pretty shitty of her.\n\nWhen something bad has happened to you, how that bad thing makes the people around you feel (if they aren't also directly affected) is a secondary concern to how you feel/what you need. Add to that she didn't tell you she needed space, she just ghosted you, and that makes it an extreme dick move on her part.\n\nThat being said, people do get overwhelmed sometimes and that's ok. We're all human. Try not to judge her too harshly for this if that's what genuinely happened. It can be hard to help other people with their emotional weight when you're dealing with stuff, but she should have at least communicated that to you (along with deets of what happened and that she was safe and recuperating and not dead in a ditch/ignoring you forever)", "Wow. so thats her response to your moment in crisis. Whoa. Just wow. I guess youre not as good friends as you thought you were?\n\nMaybe this is something to talk about, what is friendship to her and whether this was beyond the boundary for her, and if thats the case that is fair enough. You can still be friends. But you wont be able to rely on this person in future, so for events like thins, maybe ask family instead and if it ever happens again, she should maybe drop you off at an emergency. Drugged = not safe.", "NTA \n\nThis is not a real friend. She sounds like a narcisstic brat. \n\nMy friend cared for me when something happend to me on multiple occasions and I did the same for them, thats what friends are for.", "NTA she doesn't sound like a genuine friend", "Going out clubbing by yourself with no drink cover? Very risky behavior but your definitely NTA.", "NTA, you need a new friend the complete lack of empathy here is shocking", "I am sorry you were drugged. Someone committed a crime against you. I hope you are able to take care of yourself and I'm so glad you were able to get out of that situation. That said, I don't believe she is truly your true best friend, or a decent friend for that matter. She is showing her true colors. There is absolutely zero reason to get upset with someone for needing help when someone criminal has decided to incapacitate them. She's done enough for you. It's excruciatingly painful when the people we care about show that they don't care enough about us. I'm sorry this is the case for you, but you get to figure out where to go from here. If I were you I would consider it what it means to be a best friend.", "NAH.  But your friend has as much right to feel what she is feeling as you do.  Lay off her.  I know it\u2019s hard to think about others when you\u2019re feeling anxious, but you really need to. It be so selfish in that regard.  It sounds like your friend may have more going on too than you know.", "YTA she's a friend not a therapist, when you're at a point you're calling her several times a week to talk you down from anxiety you're at a point where you shouldn't be placing the responsibility for your mental health so squarely on someone else's shoulders. Get actual help.\n\nNot the AH for calling for help when you got your drink spiked of course, but the rest of this makes it seem like you have a pattern of behaviour. Also did you thank her for saving you after your drink got spiked?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe ha sa life of her own, and she helped you in an emergency - she is great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut for your everyday therapeutic needs, find a therapist. your friend ahs a life of her own.", "Look she gave you an answer, told you her version and asked to be left alone.\n\nYou not stopping your questions makes you YTA.\n\nShe dropped whatever she was doing and got you an unconscious person out of a club by herself.

Were you clubbing alone or with people you couldn't trust? The fact that you had to call a friend who wasn't even there tells me that it must be one of the two.", "\\> I do rescue her like all the time so\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nO RLY?", "Considering that OP says most of the calls were when they  \" were feeling anxious and needed her to talk me down\" it definitely sounds like the friend has reached capacity. I can see it being a case of \"I can't deal with this anymore\".", "Or maybe this isn't the first or last time something of this ilk has happened.\n\nReads like the OP might have a substance issue that people have to deal with in the past.\n\nWhich is why she is getting iced out.", "In which case that makes the friend TA, not OP", "Ehhh, there's something to be said for friendship requiring a certain amount of comitment on both sides or reciprocity and how OP has mentioned in the comments that she's done similar \"saving\" for her friend on many occasions but this is the first time she's asked for serious help like this. But that's neither here nor there\n\nOP described them as being \"best friends\" which usually implies a certain amount of support and investiture from both parties. I've known a great many couples that were less invested than some close friend pairs. And given that this is something that it has been established that OP does for her, it was reasonable to expect reciprocity.\n\nAnd I'm not knocking the friend needing and seeking support elsewhere. 'Dumping' in this case means shifting/creating emotional load, not \"trauma dumping\" which is a seperate thing (they're sometimes related, but not necessarily in this case). My point about 'dumping' is that by immediately acting only in her own self interest by wholly ignoring OP without communicating *at all*, she was acting on her personal feelings on the matter (whatever those may be) in a way that hurt OP. Not just due to the lack of information and support (information you could argue OP was owed for her own safety, although if her friend couldn't give support at the time that was reasonable. But given that OP had no idea what happened, yes, she was owed whatever details could be mustered if only so she knew if she needed to go to the damn hospital or police station for a fucking rape kit or not) but also out of genuine concern for her friend who effectively ghosted her while she was in a vulnerable state (and, quite possibly, not fully off of whatever she was drugged yet)\n\nThe friend isn't in the wrong for needing space or needing time. She's not wrong for not being able to support OP at the time (assuming she was legitimately unable to, which I do assume). She's in the wrong for failing to communicate what happened (again, necessary health information here!) or her needs (for space) or that she was, at least, still alive/okay when OP got concerned. That she later claimed OP was invalidating her feelings by *sharing that she was concerned when her friend ghosted her and that she needed support* after a highly traumatic event is also problematic because, again, immediate ghosting and relationship reciprocity. When you are the less affected party in a situation, it's on you to communicate your needs effectively and at the very least try not to mess the more affected person up even more. Especially if they reach out to you. You don't have to be their emotional support, but you do have to tell them if you're unwilling to even talk about the issue with them (especially if that's 1. something they do for you and 2. a common part of your relationship)", "Actually a narcissist would, because it would look bad if they didn't. Also they could use it against them. \n\nOP has posted that this is the first time she's needed rescued by her friend but she rescues her friend all the time.", "If someone is unconscious like that, you take them to the ER. Even if they have been drinking. Most people do fall asleep when super drunk but don't go fully unconscious the way she did. Even if she hasn't been spiked, she could have had alcohol poisoning. Better to be safe than sorry.", "She knew that what happened during the time OP was unconscious. It's normal to ask about the time OP was unconscious since OP literally has no idea what happened. OP knows what happened at the club up until she was unconscious. Her \"friend\" knows what happened once she got there & picked her up.", "A friend I don\u2019t know tooo well and her group of friends, Ik it was stupid. Never doing that again", "In another comment OP mentions this is the first time they have had to be rescued, whereas they apparently have rescued this \"friend\" multiple times.\n\nReads more like OP has been dealt a blessing in disguise - at the very least they can now be more aware of their friend's poor communication skills in tense times and can now adjust their own as well as their expectations of this friend. Alternatively (if this is not a palatable path) OP may choose to re-evaluate the relationship altogether.", "Hahahah I promise I do not", "OP isn\u2019t a reliable narrator. An unconscious woman in the bathrooms and her friend just walked into bar and had the miraculous strength to hoist an unconscious woman onto her shoulder, walk past a lot of security and staff in a crowded bar and just put her in her car and then again somehow get her out of the car, hoist her back up on her shoulder, carry the unconscious OP into her bed and put her to bed?\n\nNo, an unconscious woman in a club bathroom = ambulance is called by staff and ambulance tries to determine next of kin to call. \n\nThere\u2019s a looot of creative writing in this narrative", "Yes I know, I'm talking about Op wanting to question the friend about what happened.\nHow would the friend know. \nShe rescued Op and took her home.", "That's called an acquaintance, not a friend.", "Gotcha, be careful out there! Lots of untrustworthy people around unfortunately.", "Could your friend be mad at you and is victim blaming?", " Also did you thank her for saving you after your drink got spiked.", "I doubt it, I hope not, I\u2019ll ask her when me talk\u2026", "I don't think you're an asshole.  Young and careless?  Yes.  Asshole?  No.\n\nI would've done the same thing: called a friend.  In fact, I have done exactly that thing.  Although, I hung out with a bunch of drug addicted alcoholics back then, so I'm probably not the best frame of reference for what is normal amongst young women.\n\nShe came and bailed you out, and it turns out that's the type of thing with which she's not comfortable.  She was probably very scared and extremely anxious. Maybe give her a bit to get over it, stop calling her and wait until she comes to you.  It's likely she's not a huge fan of you being any type of dependent on her right now.\n\nPlease do be more careful.  I don't think you're in the U.S. because of your age, but here, folks drug girls with Fentanyl more often than with anything else nowadays, which means they'll be doing it elsewhere soon if they're not already.  It's much, much more dangerous than the good ole rohypnol or GHB.  It's incredibly more potent and unless dosed in a proper lab, is very often over dosed and, even when taken orally, can lead to.. well.. overdose."]}
