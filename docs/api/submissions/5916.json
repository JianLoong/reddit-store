Not only has he not handed in a single assignment since October, but he\u2019s starting to go out with his friends and do stupid things to get banned and/or kicked out from places. \n\nAll the neighbours know him as the little shit, employees at our Walmart despise him and the mall security told me that if he sees my brother again he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to hold back.\n\nIdk why my brother\u2019s being like this but it\u2019s pissing me the fuck off. \n\nNo matter what I say, he just tells me to chill before saying something ridiculously outrageous just to get a reaction out of me. \n\nOur parents are constantly working and go on work trips so I\u2019m usually left to deal with him until our nanny comes over. She\u2019s the only person he listens to. Idk why but fuck if I care. I\u2019m just glad he behaves. \n\nAnyways, I work at a McDonald\u2019s and guess who showed up while I was working. My brother. I was cleaning up a table when he walked up to me with a cup full of coke before dropping it on the floor. On purpose. But obviously he went \u201coh shit I\u2019m sooo sorry.\u201d I was so fucking over it. I cleaned it up without causing a scene and when I went home I told him that I was done.\n\nI called our nanny right that very second and just began to cry to her about everything he\u2019s done. He kept begging me not to and got really upset when I finally hung up and called me a bitch. \n\nOur nanny showed up an hour later and basically let him have it. She was so disappointed that even I felt bad. My brother cried and she told him that this wasn\u2019t the -name- she helped raise and that she can\u2019t even look at him.\n\nShe left after giving me a hug and making us dinner but my brother is still upset. He keeps glaring at me and won\u2019t come out of his room. The last thing he said to me was that he fucking hates my snitch ass. I\u2019m glad he isn\u2019t being a menace anymore but I do feel bad, him and our nanny are the best of friends. AITA?\n\nQuick edit:\n\n\nOur parents know but don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal. My mom thinks he just wants attention and says it\u2019s best to ignore (logic??) and my dad thinks it\u2019s funny. But they don\u2019t see the full extent so idk.\n\nAlso nanny is a hired caregiver that\u2019s been with us since we were babies.

His behavior has been awful. \n\nHe desperately wants attention, to the point where he thinks that even negative attention is a great thing. If people are pissed off at him, hey, to him, that\u2019s still more attention than he was getting. \n\nThe solution here: He needs a tighter leash. He needs an interest that is not a potential criminal charge, and he needs more boundaries, not fewer. He needs a buddy, a guide, a mentor, but a real one, because fake interest will probably look like a fraud to him. In short: He needs someone to step up and parent him, because your parents are unwilling or unable to do it. \n\nTalk to the nanny (just you) and ask her to talk to him. Just the two of them. Have her express her disappointment with him, while also saying that she knows he\u2019s a good person who just needs a better alternative to spending his time. \n\nCan he get a job, like walking dogs or cutting grass for neighbors? Can he do volunteer work? \n\nHe\u2019s a kid who is at loose ends, and he needs guidance. Your mother\u2019s plan to \u201cignore\u201d him is convenient for her (funny how that works out for her), but in a few years, she\u2019s going to be expressing shock and dismay at how her kid needs to go to rehab for drugs or jail for doing something that REALLY got him some attention.", "NTA .. your brother needs to learn to not be a little bastard\nif your folks wont do it a stretch in juvie will", "NTA but it's a pity you have to rely on your nanny to do your parents' job for them. I'd also have a talk with your parents about your brother going off the rails. Point out that surely it would be better to stop him now before he starts doing things that are criminal, or crystalizes his personality into being a jerk for life.\n\nThe worst that can happen from telling your parents is that they blow it off and neglect you both -- but that may be par for the course. Your parents are the biggest As here as far as I can see. Perhaps if they gave you both more attention and direction your brother wouldn't be acting out like this.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your parents aren\u2019t there to parent your brother but somebody has to and it\u2019s not you. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want you to \u201csnitch\u201c, which btw is a ridiculous accusation when you need to get help because his behaviour affects you directly, he now knows to make sure you don\u2019t know about the $h!t he\u2019s up to. \n\nWon\u2018t be long until police get involved if he keeps at it anyway and while depending on your location he may be too young for legal consequences, that\u2018ll probably be when your parents will have to answer for his behaviour/their absence.", "Your parents are assholes for dismissing his tantrums with the typical \"boys will be boys\" nonsense.

The only thing I can see working is your aunt (who will understand the psychological issues here & potential problems) & nanny sitting your parents down & being blunt AF with them about their dereliction of duties.\n\nYou seem clear-headed & capable but you are 16 & should not left in charge of your 12yo brother, even if he were an angel. I'm not sure what country you are in but in mine this situation wouldn't be difficult to get CP authorities involved in & it's something you may need to consider doing yourself. \n\nYour brothers behaviour is EXTREMELY concerning & without intervention it will escalate, it just will. He's got zero regard for everyone & everything Inc himself & that's probably cos he doesn't feel like he matters & that is the fault of your parents.
