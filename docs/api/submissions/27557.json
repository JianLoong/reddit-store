S has never seen the movie and me and my dad are huge Batman fans. So we all agreed to 9 PM showing on Saturday last month. \n\nHowever the Wednesday before the show, me and my dad received a text saying that our family was arriving a week earlier than expected and to visit them that weekend. It\u2019s usually a weekend long family event. And we both were annoyed by the short notice. \n\nI asked my dad if he wanted to cancel seeing TDK but he said no and we AGREED to not tell our family we were going to the movies because we didn\u2019t want them there because in his words, \u201cthey were too much and he wanted to relax\u201d.\n\nSaturday comes, me, dad, and S arrive to our family\u2019s Airbnb at 8 AM and have a blast. \n\nAt around 6:30 PM, I tap my dad on the shoulder and gesture to the time (we had to go home and change and catch the bus since we had been drinking a bit and he didn\u2019t want to drive). \n\nWe prepare to leave and everyone is asking us what\u2019s going on, where we\u2019re going, etc. \n\nMy dad caved and tells them after a few seconds of badgering. Our family immediately starts looking up movie times, the prices of the tickets (tickets were $5 so money wasn\u2019t an issue for 15 people) and what restaurants would accept a reservation for 15 people on such short notice etc. and demanded I cancel the 9 PM show and get tickets for 11 PM so everyone can go and we can sit together. \n\nI said no and told them they weren\u2019t invited. They all were shunned, thought I was joking and being unfair since my cousins etc were little kids and didn\u2019t see the movie yet. \n\nI looked for my dad for help but he stayed silent and S looked overwhelmed but I didn\u2019t except her to say anything. I told them me, dad and S already planned this out for weeks and we would come back after the movie is over to spend the night. \n\nThey called me selfish and said everyone goes or no one does to make it \u201cfair\u201d. Again, my dad didn\u2019t say anything and I was pissed because HE\u2019S the one who didn\u2019t want them to go. \n\nSo I simply left, muted my phone notifications, got an Uber to change at home and caught the bus to see the movie. Like originally planned.\n\nMy dad was texting me, begging me to come back and I simply texted him the tickets and said \u201cyou can still come if you want\u201d but him and S never showed.\n\nI came back from the movie a few hours later and my dad confronted me saying I left him in an uncomfortable position, our whole family \u201cchewed him out for having a disrespectful kid\u201d and I made S cry all night.\n\nNow for the past week my family has been treating me like Kevin in Home Alone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695566995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qzkce/aita_for_not_inviting_my_extended_family_to_see/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since they were the ones that on short notice barged into your home you shouldn't have to change your original plans.  They should be understanding given the circumstances.

Then the whole extended family come to visit (unexpectedly early). She's already overwhelmed meeting them but her boyfriend assures her ahead of time that the movies will just be them to get a break from the extended family ... until it comes down to the wire, boyfriend is tipsy, refuses to stick to the original plan, and lets his kid take the fall, then refuses to leave.

I do understand it's sometimes easier to go along with these types of people than to stand up for yourself. \n\nFamily is TA. They came on short notice, you already had plans. And it's just a movie, you were planning on returning. They need to chill TF out. \n\nAnd you're not a disrespectful kid. You're an autonomous adult who can make their own decisions.", "NTA  you had plans and the 11pm was maybe too late? Anyway no one stopped them from going to see the movie at 11pm you are not all joined at the hip.\n\nBtw tell your dad he's a coward and an ah for not telling the truth that he didn't want to change the plans initially."]}
