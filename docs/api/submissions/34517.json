Water nature names. My sister is Ocean, I'm Cove and my brother is River. They wanted our names to have a theme without being matchy with the same initial so we got our names. The story was told to us when we were little and my parents were proud of the names they gave us.\n\nBack when we were all stuck at home my parents started to express regret about their choices for us. They actually told us over dinner one night that they wish they had given us better names and apologized for making us live with the names we were given. A few months after that apology my mom and dad told us they wanted us to be Elizabeth (sister), James (me) and Michael (brother). They said since we were kids and weren't in college yet and nobody had their license at that point it would be the best time to do it. All three of us said we didn't want to change our first names. My dad looked into whether they could do it when we said no and all answers he got pointed to a very strong no. But it was also unusual to change your older kids first name so they went ahead and tried anyway but once we were asked if we wanted different names they were told no.\n\nMy parents brought it up a lot to us afterward. My brother asked why they wanted to name him Michael and said the name was crappy. They told him Michael was a timeless name that would age well and gave him some nickname choices. He said he hated it. So they asked if he would consider Charles instead which he said was an even bigger no. Our parents focused really hard on him for a while because he had asked the question about the name so they figured he was the most open.\n\nSo far none of us have agreed to the name change. I told my parents that I know they regret the names but we're all used to and like our names and don't want to go for more boring and common names. My parents argued that in the future we will regret it and we'd have to pay for it ourselves when we're adults and we realize having weird names does not age well. I asked why they can't let us get there ***if*** we ever do. They said we should be thinking more of our futures and they accused me of having a really bad attitude because I said James was as bad to me as Cove is to them now. They told me to look online and I did and I saw a lot of hate for our names. But I told them it still didn't change my mind.\n\nMy parents said we should respect them enough as parents to allow this and that we're all being disrespectful.

This is something they have been pushing for and advocating about for a few years now and they have other names chosen for us, and maybe even backups. They are my parents and I know their current opinion is pretty strongly based on what a lot of people think about our names. So where I'm kinda at is it might be disrespectful to dismiss their opinion on this and refusing to comply when I know the shit our names get and I know my parents just want to stop that from negative consequences in the future. Like when we're working and stuff. I also wasn't very nice about the name they wanted to give me.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your names are lovely!", "NTA, it\u2019s your name and if you like it, keep it. Your parents need to chill.", "NTA. If you like your names, they should not be trying to change them.", "NTA\n\n>I told my parents that I know they regret the names but we're all used to and like our names and don't want to go for more boring and common names. My parents argued\n\nThis alone tells that your parents are stupid for arguing even after you told them that. They think they have a mistake you think they haven't. Who would possibly suffer in the future by said mistake? You. So if you deny a name change they should just shut up about it. If they feel so guilty they can make a deposit in y'all's names (lol pun) and give it to you when you are 18+ to decide for yourself. This argument is stupid. You like it, period. It's they who regret it for some reason and not you. Maybe a colleague called your dad king of the sea and your mother Ursula that they have become so sensitive and immature about this issue. Why build tension by arguing on and on.", "And they should respect you enough as people with their own thoughts to not force the issue. This is an entirely \"them\" situation. They named you, they have come to dislike it, they are trying to force you to change, they are continuing to bring it up when you said no.\n\nNTA", "NTA maybe ask what triggered their decision, it's odd that they suddenly hate the names they chose.", "NTA, I think Cove is a badass name. Also it's wild to me that they just suggested names they wanted you to change to and didn't ask you if you had a name you'd rather be called. \n\nIf you're worried about the future you could always add a more traditional middle name (which you choose) and then you'll have the option in your professional life of going by your middle name if you prefer.", "NTA. Think of all the kids from different cultures with unique names. They all fit in society well enough, you guys will be fine. Heck, it can even be a great icebreaker", "NTA. Tell your parents to stop being disrespecful themselves and leave you names alone. You are happy with them. That's all that matters.", "NTA your parents thought their theme was so unique and clever, then they went online and saw that there\u2019s a lot of hate for it. Now they feel bad that the names might affect your futures. But the time for them to worry about that was before they named you. You guys like your names. You feel your identities are tied to those names and you want to keep them. They gave no right to bully you about this just because they regret their choices. You\u2019re teenagers, not puppies.", "NTA. Sounds to me like the only ones embarrassed of your names are the people who gave them to you all. \n\nMy mother decided to name my sisters and I after the names of various plants and trees, so I also have an unusual name, but I love it and I wouldn't change it for the world.", "That's one of the arguments I made. That *we* will pay the price if we regret it some day, not them. They claim that's the very reason we should do it now and they don't care if we don't regret it now because we will. They refuse to believe we might not. Personally I don't think I will but I know my parents would argue that point with me.", "My parents said they felt they had to choose to right the wrong. But also because they knew we liked our names. So they didn't want us to change them to more of the same.\n\nI'm not worried about the future really. My parents are and they are pushing for us to. Not sure if my siblings have any doubts but I don't.", "Compared to the names me and my twin sister gave yours are tame. Both of us love our unusual names and have never had it be a problem professionally. Although I've had a few raised eyebrows here and there and in my teens and twenties I constantly had to pull my ID out to show it really was my name. My sister has had a continuous mispronunciation battle with some people who just keep saying her name wrong. Sometimes for years or decades. But she's always just rolled with it and accepts that some people just can't pronounce her name."]}
