This is something they have been pushing for and advocating about for a few years now and they have other names chosen for us, and maybe even backups. They are my parents and I know their current opinion is pretty strongly based on what a lot of people think about our names. So where I'm kinda at is it might be disrespectful to dismiss their opinion on this and refusing to comply when I know the shit our names get and I know my parents just want to stop that from negative consequences in the future. Like when we're working and stuff.

My parents argued\n\nThis alone tells that your parents are stupid for arguing even after you told them that. They think they have a mistake you think they haven't. Who would possibly suffer in the future by said mistake? You. So if you deny a name change they should just shut up about it. If they feel so guilty they can make a deposit in y'all's names (lol pun) and give it to you when you are 18+ to decide for yourself. This argument is stupid. You like it, period. It's they who regret it for some reason and not you. Maybe a colleague called your dad king of the sea and your mother Ursula that they have become so sensitive and immature about this issue. Why build tension by arguing on and on.", "And they should respect you enough as people with their own thoughts to not force the issue. This is an entirely \"them\" situation.

Also it's wild to me that they just suggested names they wanted you to change to and didn't ask you if you had a name you'd rather be called. \n\nIf you're worried about the future you could always add a more traditional middle name (which you choose) and then you'll have the option in your professional life of going by your middle name if you prefer.", "NTA. Think of all the kids from different cultures with unique names. They all fit in society well enough, you guys will be fine. Heck, it can even be a great icebreaker", "NTA.

That's all that matters.", "NTA your parents thought their theme was so unique and clever, then they went online and saw that there\u2019s a lot of hate for it. Now they feel bad that the names might affect your futures. But the time for them to worry about that was before they named you. You guys like your names. You feel your identities are tied to those names and you want to keep them. They gave no right to bully you about this just because they regret their choices. You\u2019re teenagers, not puppies.", "NTA. Sounds to me like the only ones embarrassed of your names are the people who gave them to you all.

Sometimes my name gets me unusual looks when I'm called at the GP's office, but I get a lot more positive remarks towards it by far.", "That's one of the arguments I made. That *we* will pay the price if we regret it some day, not them. They claim that's the very reason we should do it now and they don't care if we don't regret it now because we will.

Both of us love our unusual names and have never had it be a problem professionally. Although I've had a few raised eyebrows here and there and in my teens and twenties I constantly had to pull my ID out to show it really was my name. My sister has had a continuous mispronunciation battle with some people who just keep saying her name wrong. Sometimes for years or decades. But she's always just rolled with it and accepts that some people just can't pronounce her name.", "In a universe where your parents are sane:\n\n\"We know that sometimes unique names can be considered difficult to live with so wanted to let you know we'll support you if you choose to change them now or any other time.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but we're good.\"\n\n\"Cool.

You don't just rename teenagers to some names you like now. I'm so glad the child also has to consent and there are laws preventing parents from renaming their kids all the time.\n\nWanting to keep your name is not even remotely disrespectful, as opposed to wanting to rename your teenaged child behind their back lol", "Ocean and River aren\u2019t even that unusual. Cove is a little unusual but I like it, it sounds kinda cool. And none of you have the requisite -axxstyyns or -iyieghtleighs to make them actual r/Tragedeigh.

We also as parents teach our children to stick up for what we believe is right.\n\nYour parents  are now insisting that you alter the identity that you have grown up with and have come to love.\n\nThey are not listening to your needs and are attempting to take away your autonomous right of your identity because they, have now deemed that your identity is now inappropriate.\n\nThis is emotional neglect and, if you're feeling brave enough, you can tell them that.\n\n(research emotional neglect in families and getting needs met before you do!)\n\nStick to your guns. This is a hill for you to die on.\n\nYour parents have got this the wrong way around. *They* as parents should be respecting *your* decision to keep the names you were given at birth.

Usually I'd expect to see this the other way around with parents trying to force their unique and creative names on kids who just want to fit in. But you're old enough now to express your desire to keep the name or not, and old enough to understand that there will be some people you meet who will instantly judge you for your name, and you like the name enough to not care about this. \n\nYes it's costs money to change names, but it's honestly not a lot. There's a guy at work who paid to legally change his name to Luke Skywalker, and then paid to change it again when he realised how bad an idea this was. There is no harm in keeping your names if you like them now, you can always change them later.\n\nA friend of mine also named her baby Ocean. I think it's unusual for sure, but then so is my friend, and not at all in a bad way. If the kid grows up to be like her, Ocean will suit her just fine, and maybe you're this way too.", "I am now obsessed with the name cove is going on my baby name list NTA", "NTA. It almost sounds like there is inheritance at risk. Like, what are they not saying? Why James, Michael,  and Elizabeth? \n\nYour names are cool. I work in a job where I see names day in and day out. River, Cove, and Ocean wouldn't make me go \"what were those parents thinking?\"\n\nPrincess, Garlic, and same first and last name (Bradley Bradley) make me do that.", "Parents showing regret is OK. \n\nParents asking you if you want to change your name,  also OK. \n\nParents refusing to accept your answer, go behind your back to change it anyway and then call you names when you stick to your decision... None of that is OK.\n\nNo is a full sentence, but if you decide that you want to continue this conversation with them then I recommend you focusing on your happy with who you are as a person, and your name is part of who you are. If you keep telling them you hate name a, b or c they're just going to keep coming back with more names.\n\nYour parents could legitimately have suffered guilt for 10+ years over your names, but I do wonder if this is about something else entirely. What else could they be regretting that they can't change, so they're really forcefully focusing on this.", "NTA. Your parents changed their minds and regret the name choice. But you all apparently don't have any problems and like your names. So, it's ok for your parents to explain their change of mind and offering to pay, if any of you wants to change her/his name. They might even offer this, if it happens in the future. But right now, they need to accept your decision, as you are old enough to decide for yourself, if you prefer keeping your actual name. As long as it is a well informed decision.", "NTA Your parents are being disrespectful of your wishes. You may technically be children, but even the court takes your choice into account as you saw. I'm not huge on different names, but I like those! They're not super weird, they're spelled normally, and aren't cutesy. Why did it take your parents 10 years (at least) to decide that they don't like the names they gave you? If they had regrets, they should have changed them way before you guys got to school.", "People tend to become more conservative as they get older. That is what's happening to your parents. Their own emotional changes are their problems, not your problem.", "NTA , sounds like your parents think you kids are something to be presented to their social circle and what seemed fancy to them 16 years ago is now embarrassing or boring to them.\n\nI'm happy that you all grew comfortable with your names, that's what's most important. Your parents should have your backs and stick to their decisions instead of trying to chose against your consent and their personal preferences (again, which they had to apologize for at the first time).\n\nIt might be interesting to check what the restrictions on changing your name are, so that you have the assurance that you can change it or add a middle name later in the future if you yourselves choose to. It might calm down your parents a bit if they know the situation is under control and refusing renaming now will not result in your immediate eternal doom.", "Think about it this way- when interviewing for jobs, employers might remember more unique names versus mainstream names :) there could be 100s of people named \u2018James\u2019 applying, but Cove stands out! \ud83d\udc96", "NTA and Cove is a kick ass name", "NTA. Former teacher here. I've seen some names that are a tragedeigh. If I saw Ocean, Cove, or River, I wouldn't even bat an eye. Even worker with you as an adult, wouldn't think twice. I actually had a coworker who change their name to River. Your name is your identity, if you feel your name works, then your parents need to lay off.", "Wild idea\u2014if at some point in the future your names become an inconvenience, you can change it to one YOU decide on. Renaming older kids and disregarding their input = weird on both counts", "NTA.  Seems like bad parenting for them to try to guilt you into this so respecting their \"parenting\" would be a tough ask.", "Ok, you ready for the reason.\n\nThey are embarrassed they named you those names. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should be embarrass by your names, you should not. They are unique. The problem being one day your parents discovered they look like THOSE parents. You know, the hippy ones that give their kids weird names. Every discussion about the problems associated with unusual names typically include \u201cwhat were the parents thinking\u201d and now they realize they everyone who meets you is going to think that of them.\n\nIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them. They were only thinking of themselves when they named you. And now they are again thinking mainly about themselves with the push to rename you.", "NTA.\n\nYou all sound old enough to know whether or not you like your name. They need to respect your choices.", "NTA, these are your names.  No one should tell you to change your name.  I have a friend who lives in the islands and gave all 4 of her daughters ocean-related names and I think they are so unique and true to who they are - ocean loving surfer girls.", "NTA\n\nYour parents\u2019 behavior is bizarre. They chose the names and you have gotten used to them. It is even more bizarre they did not even ask what would you want to be called instead.", "NTA if you want to change your names in the future, that\u2019s up to you. They don\u2019t get to bully you into changing a big part of your identity. Tough luck for them, but it\u2019s NOT ABOUT THEM.

It is a bit late to be having name regrets 15 years after the fact, especially since you guys like your names. It would be different if you were the ones coming to them and asking to be renamed whatever you want. Even more so, you guys are all in high school already, you KNOW how people can be bullied by names - and very few people actually do this when you are in adulthood. \n\n\"My parents said we should respect them enough as parents to allow this\" - they are disrespecting their own past decisions and disrespecting your choice of identity right now.", "NTA it's your name and identity!

You said no that a valid and complete answer.", "NTA.   \nDid they give you a \u2018normal\u2019 middle name? Just tell them you\u2018ll use that when needed professionally.

Cove\u2019s the most unique but it\u2019s not embarrassing or so \u2018out there\u2019.\n\nI think your parents regret the name theme more than anything and how it reflects on them in society. They\u2019re obviously embarrassed telling people their kids\u2019 names because of how people react to them. \n\nMaybe there could be some professional considerations. People might overlook a resume if they see the name\u2019s unusual so they assume the applicant will be weird, for instance. But probably a stretch.

You can\u2019t be forced.\n\nI can understand their bringing it up once or twice, but to become so pushy has me wondering what\u2019s up with this name business. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be looking for ulterior motives here, but they are shoving this at you, especially since they apparently started the change of names procedure with the court.  I don\u2019t understand going that far without your approval.  That was a bullying move.  (And they still wanted you to use their name \u2019normal name picks\u2019)\n\nStrange.  Stand your ground.  Lots of people today have unusual made up sounding names.", "NTA Those names aren\u2019t even that wild. Nature names are far from unheard-of, and while yours are a bit unusual they are easily recognized and easily spelled words in English. Parents don\u2019t get an automatic do-over on every decision they make on behalf of their children, and that really goes double once the kids are teenagers. It\u2019s honestly a little creepy that they\u2019re being so overbearing about something that directly connects to your identity just at a time when their kids are in the middle of establishing an identity SEPARATE from the parents.", "NTA, your parents are they, they liked that theme for names and now have decided they want more classic names so they should change it. If you and your siblings like your names that are unusual but not the tragic names that are often posted then they shouldn\u2019t be trying to change your name. I never loved my name but if my parents told me at 15 they were changing it I\u2019d be mad because it my name and love it or not I wouldn\u2019t want to be known as anything else.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t want to change your name no one can make you. I think in college and the world beyond you will be very memorable.

I have some regrets over the name I gave my son. It's a traditional name, but also a family name and I wonder if I should have chosen something more uniquely his.\n\nIt's too late now, though.

I wouldn't even say anything to him about my regrets, I can't see anything good coming from it.\n\nI know it's not the same situation, as he isn't likely to be bullied for his name, but you can't just change your child's name when they're old enough for it to be part of who they are. It's not your choice to make any more.", "NTA. I have a very unusual name but I love it and it hasn't caused any issues in my life(40yo).

You're all at a point in your life where you're old enough to make decisions about your future, which is why they need your consent for a name change.

No, they don\u2019t get to unilaterally change your name after 15 years because they are having second thoughts. You have grown into the name, and it\u2019s understandable you want to keep it.\n\nAlso you are quite right: they should let you see for yourself if a day ever comes when you will want to change your name, and if so, you can take the necessary steps then.\n\nFun story: a friend of mine was named Michael at birth but during his school years he somehow got stuck with a totally different nickname given by his friends. So much so that as an adult, he had his name legally changed into that nickname.", "Uh, no. NTA. Your parents are morons. They don\u2019t own you and you aren\u2019t their personal property to change as they please. They wanna cry about respect?

He does introduce himself as a normal name that's close to his name when he doesn't feel like explaining the whole story (parents were hippies, he's named after a Scooby Doo character from one of the specials in the 80's).  Ocean could use Oceana, Octavia, etc etc.  Cove could use Conor, Colt, Colson, etc.  River could use Ricky, Richard, etc.\n\nBut honestly if you look up girl names that start with OC, Oceana/Oceane are the first two options that popped up for me.  River was in the first several names for guys that popped up when searching Ri names.  Cove didn't pop up as a top choice for co, but I'm betting that's because there are so many 'regular' options that start that way.\n\nKeep your unique names if you want them!", "This is reeeeeally weird- they're not about to enter witness protection, are they? NTA", "NTA\n\nWow, the audacity of your parents to hear your genuine like for your names, your feelings on the matter\u2026 and then to decide to go ahead with all the paperwork and procedures to FORCE new, mainstream, boring-ass names THEY chose for you?

They didn\u2019t even have the decency to ask what mainstream name YOU would pick. \n\nTHEY are the ones being disrespectful and unreasonable. Wow.
