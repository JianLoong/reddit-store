I was holding my daughter when business came up. Me and my husband own a business and insurance, and ect ect. My parents are the beneficials if something ever happened god forbid. My husband has disenvowed his family since he was sixteen, so its just my side. One of my sisters, lets call her K, suddenly said, thats weird. Why are our parents the ones to inherit money if something happened to us when they are older and retired (have their money) while she is struggling to pay her bills. K has been engaged for the last 11 years to a man thats 25 years her senior and is very odd. She d had 5 kids by him. She and her family gets evicted yearly due to the damage they do to the apartments and are overall struggling. In my opinion, something that they do to themselves. She refuses to work and allows her kids to rampage. Shes also recently gotten in trouble legally because she was selling her food stamps for cash and was caught. I immediately tried to change the subject but my mom didnt notice and said, \"Well now with baby if anything happens, well adopt her and the business.\" My sister snapped and demanded why she wouldnt be the next in line to raise the baby, you know, in the event me and my husbands DEATH. i tried to change the subject again. She demanded why id trust our 70 year old parents with a baby over her, an 'experienced mother.' I snapped too. \nI told her how shes getting evicted every 6 months. How everytime she thinks her boyfriend is about to leave her she gets pregnant. Years ago, she had a cps case opened against her for leaving 2 of her toddlers in a running car at a gas station. I had some.low blows, I admit. Her kids are always dirty. Snot down their faces, knotted hair. Their teeth are rotting out of their heads. She gathered her kids and left. My other sister sent a 'not cool text' and my family had two members that died in 9/11 and we have a family gathering every year so my parents are asking me to apologize and put this behind us so we can focus on that tomorrow. \nNo! Im sick of it. Shes calling out my new parenting when shes barley hanging on? She used to drop her kids off on our doorstep, barley clothed, and then return the next morning.

In case you haven\u2019t, I believe it\u2019s possible to include language that you don\u2019t want specific people to get guardianship of your child. Also is the money going into a trust to be managed by your parents? Since they are older, they might be susceptible to scams later on. A trust might make your money be more specifically managed even by your parents versus having them directly receive funds. Adding since you use the word beneficiary when typically that should be your child.", "NTA you leave your kids with the people you trust the most to take the best care of them.\n\nFor now that's your parents, but within the next 10 years you will have to make a decision on who will be in their place if, god forbid, you should ever need that.\n\nWould your other sister be a more suitable guardian just in case?", "Your sister fails to see that even in the unlikely event that she was named guardian, the money she would get would be to raise her niece, and not an inheritance for her.

You and your family should really sit down with her and discuss her overall situation. It sounds like she needs a wake up call, at the very least for the sake of your nephews/nieces.

You are also protecting your  assessts. And from what you wrote, you need to report her to CPS again &  again &  until they are permanently  removed from her & her \"fiance.\" Those children deserve a chance to live with someone who actually cares for them.

Hopefully down the road a back up couple(close friends or the other sister) would be on the list.  Clearly this sister would be a poor choice.  I don\u2019t see anything to apologize for cranky.  Rig sweeping doesn\u2019t help.  Just make sure you have the legal ducks in a row soon.  No point in risking the angel baby\u2019s future.", "NTA for stating it. I can even see why you lost your temper and went where you did with it. There were more subtle ways of handling it. You could apologize for the delivery but not the sentiment. You can also let her know that while you didn't necessarily want to hurt her, that she needs to learn to quit pushing if she doesn't want the answer.", "NTA.  There\u2019s a clause in my divorce agreement that states my ex husband isn\u2019t allowed to have my kids around my sister ever, even if I\u2019m dead.

This whole conversation didn\u2019t start about the child - it was about who gets the money if OP and husband dies. That\u2019s not money that are up for grabs in any way, shape or form. It is money that doesn\u2019t really exist unless something absolutely horrible should happen to you, and the fact that she are thinking about how \u00abshe needs them\u00bb is just disgusting. And she doesn\u2019t stop there, she keeps on nagging about who has the *right* to raise the child if you die, which is such an insensitive thing to say also. \n\nIt is nice that you have thought about what will happen for your business and your child if you both should die. This is a very sensitive and private topic, and it is also highly unrealistic that it will ever happen. For anyone in the family to argue about \u00abwho gets what\u00bb is just distasteful and wrong. \n\nBesides, she has a hard time caring for the children she already have. You just told her the truth, after she was vile and insensitive.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s the one casually discussing how much she wants to profit off your death!", "NTA. Your sister sounds a lot like my SIL. She'd tank the business, use whatever money she could get on making sure she didn't have to lift a finger for as long as possible, and continue to neglect her children and yours. She shouldn't ask questions if she isn't ready to hear the answer.", "Name a family friend then no family member", "NTA. You just stated the truth that nobody else was willing to say.

I\u2019d definitely make sure your wills are up to date and you do choose a responsible back up guardian for your daughter just in case something ever does happen to you & your husband and in the case the case that your parents are too old to care for child or have passed.

If they die the kid gets shuffled again. Perhaps a cousin? Or close friends?", "lol, nta at all.\n\nbtw my wife and i just redid our whole estate, with guardianship and a full trust for the kiddo, which ensures if the worst were to happen no one can be sneaky/sleazy and garnish extra $$$. we also set my wife's parents as guardians and they too are 70ish. you're doing well.", "Sometimes you have to tell the truth even if it\u2019s difficult to understand. Your sister needed to hear this. Don\u2019t apologize for being honest.", "NTA\n \nAnd I think it's safe to say the only reason she's willing to take the kid is because it comes with money.", "Your sister just wants the money rather than the actual kid.", "NTA. She\u2019s just after the money.", "NTA - and yes, with your parents being 70, absolutely set up a backup. You can usually actually set up guardians for different things, like a financial guardian and a physical guardian. (My dad is the financial guardian and my brother is the physical guardian, with each of them being the backup to the other, meaning if anything happened to my dad or brother, the other gets full.) However my dad is 60, he\u2019s easily got another 20 years as his parents are 84 and still kicking. \n\nSince your sister is not safe AND will be making a play to get all your child\u2019s inheritance (she doesn\u2019t care about your child at all, it\u2019s all about the business), I would start looking at iron clad backups, you can have multiple, AND add a note to your will that your sister is unsafe and not allowed around your child should anything happen to you.", "Nta do you have extended family you can ask. Like cousins? A family friend. Truthfully your elderly parents are not the best option. \n\nSecond put the money in a trust with specific details on how it has to be distributed.

Keep advocating for the kids but also be sure you and DH have ironclad legal documents to protect your daughter, your business, and your parents.  Start an EdVest fund for her college and make sure the adult in charge is trustworthy.  Get life insurance and establish some sort of trust for your daughter.  Be sure your business plans are in order and have detailed wills.  Be sure to mention your sister and her children in the will, even if it's just to say you're not leaving them anything, so she can't argue she was forgotten.  If no-contest clauses are a thing in your state, use them.  And don't apologize.  You said nothing wrong.", "Honestly I don't think  it's about your kid. It's about the money and business.

I am sorry you have to deal with this. Your job is to ensure your child is raised safely.  You don't think your sister can do it. AND she only wants the $$....not the kid!!", "Your sister doesn't understand that her life is a walking dumpster fire?

Its clear you don't think she'd be a good fit for guardian of your child. Give yourself some peace of mind if you haven't already done so and draw up a will.

She asked again, once again you tried to avoid confrontation. She asked a third time, this time demanding an answer. She wanted an answer, so you gave her one.

Don't let this continue.", "Nta for what you said to her but you're a huge ah for allowing her to continue the neglect", "NTA. I feel like it's super common for parents to choose their parents as legal guardians for their child/children if something happens to them. Also, for all the people who are freaking out over why OP hasn't called CPS to report what's happening to her nieces and/or nephews: calling CPS is not the magic cure-all that people think it is. It takes a lot for CPS to remove a child or children from their parent(s), and even if they do end up removing the kids, there's no guarantee that the kids won't end up in an equally awful house. Despite existing to ya know, ***protect*** children, CPS doesn't seem to give a crap about kids who are being abused or mistreated. Just another absolutely worthless government entity that cares more about money than helping the people it's supposed to help.", "NTA but you're stupid for having the discussion in front of people not involved. There's ZERO chance your sister ever would have asked you about this without you first bringing it up.\n\nWe all have tough family members, but we don't point it out to their face.

Your feelings towards your sister and the way she raises her family are completely valid, but you could easily have said that she has enough on her plate and doesn't need another child added to the mix.

However, you spend a lot of time judging your sister and calling out what appears to be neglect of her children, but what are you doing to help those children? You're so worried about your baby in the event of your death, but seem to care less about your own nieces and nephews. As someone who grew up in a horrible, abusive and neglectful environment, with aunts and uncles that had the means to help, but turn a blind eye, I don't think of them as any better than my abusive parents. Now I know many will say it's not your responsibility, but it is, it's all of your families responsibilities to help those innocent children, yet it feels you hold them in contempt and blame them for their dirty clothes, and snotty noses.

She of course is the AH for questioning, pushing, etc.\n\nAdditionally, find a friend or someone younger you trust to have guardianship over your kids.  Seventy year old parents who might be say 80 if something happens to you when the kid is 10, is NOT a good plan.", "YTA you could have just said by grace of God or whoever you believe let\u2019s hope that day will never come.

I immediately tried to change the subject but my mom didnt notice and said, \"Well now with baby if anything happens, well adopt her and the business.\" My sister snapped and demanded why she wouldnt be the next in line to raise the baby, you know, in the event me and my husbands DEATH. i tried to change the subject again. She demanded why id trust our 70 year old parents with a baby over her, an 'experienced mother.' I snapped too. \nI told her how shes getting evicted every 6 months. How everytime she thinks her boyfriend is about to leave her she gets pregnant. Years ago, she had a cps case opened against her for leaving 2 of her toddlers in a running car at a gas station. I had some.low blows, I admit. Her kids are always dirty. Snot down their faces, knotted hair. Their teeth are rotting out of their heads. She gathered her kids and left. My other sister sent a 'not cool text' and my family had two members that died in 9/11 and we have a family gathering every year so my parents are asking me to apologize and put this behind us so we can focus on that tomorrow. \nNo! Im sick of it. Shes calling out my new parenting when shes barley hanging on? She used to drop her kids off on our doorstep, barley clothed, and then return the next morning. And shes upset I dont want to give her guardianship if me and my husbands death happens?!?!?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Make sure there is a clause in your paperwork explicitly stating that your sister is excluded from ever getting custody of your daughter. It might sound silly or unimportant but let me tell you a little story. Someone I know had 2 adorable boys. Custody was to go to her parents if anything were to happen. Sadly, a drunk driver happened. So kids went to her parents. Not long after, I think it was 2 years later, her parents passed in an accident. The kids went to the sister, who was much like yours. Parents did not have any kind of safety net in place to keep the boys away from the irresponsible sister. It was a big mess.

I know firsthand, sadly. My daughter\u2019s best friend was not going to school for months at a time (school called CPS and sent police), her teeth were breaking out of her mouth due to cavities (2 different dentists called CPS after offering free treatment and parents never came back to have it done for 2 of their kids), we were giving them clothing and food (we also called and offered to take in 2 of the kids). They come out and check on the kids and yet refuse to remove them or truly enforce anything because \u201cthe system is overwhelmed with higher priority cases with documented abuse.\u201d So often if there are family members/friends helping nearby, they \u201ccheck in\u201d but won\u2019t remove the children.", "100% agree\n\nThere is no action.

It\u2019s not something to attempt to do yourself.", "The issue is that (at least US/Medicaid - Dental\u2026) there are often copays associated depending on the state. \n\nKids I referred to are in CA and the extractions they needed plus crowns (older child had adult teeth) were going to cost them money, plus it doesn\u2019t cover nitrous if kids are nervous. So it\u2019s not like Medicaid/Medical where all associated costs are covered on the dental side. That is why CPS can pull kids more easily for medical neglect but not as easily for dental neglect. It may be the same where OP is located. \n\nThe issue I had was I arranged for free dental treatment and parents blew it off. That\u2019s also why the 2 dentists reported - they offered to treat them for free and they never came back for the scheduled treatments (kids were scared and they didn\u2019t want to deal with it).

And even worse, then they are likely to isolate themselves from the family. \n\nI do think the immediate family needs to do more to tangibly help the kids. Not just give the parents money for bills.

They don't have the resources to focus on neglect, they're out there stopping parents from beating their kids to death, selling their kids' virginity, having their kids sell drugs for them, etc. And child protection laws in a lot of places are extremely lax. Social workers can only remove when the neglect hits a certain criteria, and that criteria can be shockingly high. There's also a terrifying lack of foster homes these days, especially for sibling groups.

According to OP, whenever Sis thought her boyfriend was leaving, bingo new baby is coming. No Plan B for that.", "I agree with this. Once CPS is showing up all the time the parents can quickly identify who is sending them their way and they WILL isolate themselves. The parents obviously can't be counted on to spend the money responsibly. If there is money to be spared then it needs to be spent on stuff that will actually benefit the kids. Making sure they get Christmas gifts is nice but shouldn't be a priority.", "I completely agree. Growing up with my awful mother we had CPS called on us a lot by family members and from our schools.
