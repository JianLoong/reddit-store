I was never close to C because of our age difference but he\u2019s my brother and I do love him. \u00a0C got his now wife pregnant when he was 18 and at that time I was 8.   \n\n\nI think he resents me being born and still a child when his kid came around because our parents gave me more attention as I was still dependent on have my parents teach me and taking care of me. That meant that he didn\u2019t get much help from my parents because they still had to take care of me, my sister and my brother.   \n\n\nMy brother was old enough to take care of him self but he got help with school from our parents (they gave him money for school) and they hade to spend money for my sister and I so my parents couldn\u2019t give my brother the help he needed. They did offer to let them live with them but they could not support them.   \n\n\nAnyhow we are now adults, my sister and my brother B and I are finished with university and have stable jobs but C doesn\u2019t have one and he\u2019s asking Only me to give him money for being the reason my parents couldn\u2019t give them as much help as they could m. I felt bad and did help them but now every time I give them money they make fun of me and treats me like shit.   \n\n\nMy nephew and my brother and his wife basically use me as an ATM and they have never once asked my other siblings to help them. Only me. So I stopped after they made fun of my trauma that I\u2019m still in therapy for.   \n\n\nNow they are saying am an Ah, I feel bad but my parents and other siblings are on my side and has given them the silent treatment.

You owe them because your parents didn\u2019t support them (note: your parents didn\u2019t owe them shit)? That\u2019s some bull shit logic. Don\u2019t feel bad and absolutely don\u2019t give them another penny. Repeat after me, \u201cfuck off you selfish and entitled prick.\u201d NTA", "You are nta, ur brother is taking out his anger on you for his own actions is just pathetic. Honestly you are better off without him in ur life. And the reason why ur family are giving him the silent treatment is most likely because of how he has been treating you over the years. I must ask tho has they ever stood up for you before ?", "NTA. \n\nYou were a minor child entitled to your parents' care and support. \n\nHe was an adult with control over his own life. \n\nHe made choices he regrets, but that is not your fault. You were a child who had no control over him. \n\nPut some distance between that family and you so they can't abuse you any longer.", "NTA.  You're not responsible for your brother or his family.  Do not resume giving them money.", "NTA for cutting off the gravy train for your entitled older brother.  Not your fault your brother at 18 didn\u2019t use birth control. The way to \u2018make this right\u2019 is to block all 3 of those entitled people who decided you were a weak mark to take advantage of.", "NTA. Your brother and sil are. Do not cave, do not give them anymore money or thought. You owe them nothing. You shouldn\u2019t have given him anything to begin with. Be like your family and go radio silent.", "Wtf. Birth order is no one's fault. Your brother is acting like a toddler. You were a literal child. Also your brother became a father at 18. Not being able to financially support a child is one such consequence of having a baby at 18. Parents often do help but they are not obligated to. They love your nephew, I have no doubt, but you and your siblings were their responsibility. Not your brother's child. \n\nI advise you to reduce contact with these people.", "NTA.  They don't respect you. Block them. There is no need to keep the lines open if a person is not bringing you peace. If you do see them just say it's not up for discussion and keep it moving.", "NTA   You don't owe them anything.  You don't control your parents and siblings behavior and C is being shunned because of their behavior", "Absolutely NTA. It is not your fault you were born they are grown adults responsible for themselves.", "NTA and not an ATM.  Cut this off and go full no on this.", "NTA, holding someone accountable for being a child 15 years ago sounds stupid. \n\nYou are and were not the AH in this situation and he has no right asking you for money.", "Nta", "NTA. You were right to stop letting them treat you like their personal ATM. You are also totally entitled to be angry and hurt by the way they have spoken toand treated you. Make it clear that it isn\u2019t your fault that he knocked his gf up when he was 18 and while you might continue to feel pity for him that he isn\u2019t able to afford as much as you are it isn\u2019t your job as his baby brother to foot his family\u2019s bills.", "NTA. Don't give this person anymore money.", "Stop giving ALL of these AHs money.", "NTA\n\nYou said they treat you like an ATM. You already know the answer to the question you posed.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact that your brother is blaming your existence for his dissatisfaction with his life path makes him a huge AH.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe your greedy, selfish brother and his family anything. You *never* owed him anything. \n\nHe has been using emotional blackmail to force you to help support him, and being nasty and ungrateful even when you do give money.\n\n*Stop immediately.* Don't give him a penny more. I suggest you block his phone calls and keep him out of your life.", "SOoo NTA!   - They extorted cash from you. Despite what occurred btw your brother and parents it does not involve you. It is a moot point. Currently and in the past they ask for $, you provide and they treat you like crap. They are not good people. You stopped funding them; this is a boundary and do not budge. Your boundary is 'making it right'. People who behave poorly when a boundary is set are the ones that benefitted the most with no boundary.  They use con artist tactics. I am sorry you are experiencing this. When this gets you down invest in yourself and those you love. You cannot control their behavior or their perspective.; only your own. Best to you.", "Nta.  I grew up with a similar situation.   My older brother blamed my younger brother and myself for his issues.  If we hadn't been born he thought he wouldn't have the issues.  He would have.  Please get help.  Read 'codependent no more'.  After years of being blamed it will take a while but you can get over the feelings of guilt and learn to recognize what you are and are not responsible for.  You are not responsible for your brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I\u2019m sorry op if this sounds harsh but jfc wake up!!! YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS! He choose to have unprotected sex. The result? A baby. He chose to keep said baby. HIS. CHOICES. Did you force him to have sex? Did you force him to keep the baby? Did you force your parents to have? The answer to all those is NO. YOU owe your brother absolutely nothing.", "Ok, so your brother had a kid at 18, and expected your parents to be responsible instead of him (do adult choices and you will have adult consequences) but your parents were busy raising their own kid, and now he thinks you own him somehow? He is pathetic. And entitled and a asshlole. Stop giving he money.\n\nNta", "Wow. Your brother is an AH, but NTA, to you! My oldest brother had his daughter when I was 7, and he was 19. Instead of being jealous he loved that I was close enough in age to be super fun Aunty, (which I am, \ud83d\ude09) and still older enough to give her advice when she hit her teens. I love her and she's one of my best friends. I am now 53, have numerous nieces, nephews, and great-nieces and nephews, but there's something about the bond I have with her that is different.", "They are morons. Your parents didn't owe them shit. You certainly don't owe them anything. They are the ones who chose to get pregnant and have a child when they were 18. Instead of being grateful for the help they did get (housing) they want to take it out on you. Don't give them nothing anymore. Cut that cancer out of your life.", "NTA How did you ever fall for that? He was 18, his parents didn't owe him more help. You were a child who couldn't help being born. How on earth do you owe him? This is the logic of an abuser. For goodness sake stop giving him money and go NC. Get therapy so you can see how twisted all this is.", "Your brother is not entitled in any way to your help. His situation is entirely his responsibility and him guilting you is not a good look. You do not owe him anything ebcause your parents couldn't help him with the situation he put himself in. NTA.", "You. Were. A. Child.  \n\nJust because your brother and his gf did the nude and dirty without a coat, at 18, and she got pregnant, does not mean that you are in any way responsible for his decisions, unless you, as an 8 yo were supposed to act as natural birth control to prevent him from doing the deed in the first place?  Either way, that failure is on him.  Not you.\n\nAnd for him to be demanding money from you, and not your other siblings, when you weren't the only child in the house that your parents were taking care of at the time, is outrageous.  It was outrageous anyway, your parents didn't owe him anything regardless of if they had been taking care of their own children or not.\n\nYou need to tell your brother to be an adult.  And stop blaming his short comings as a parent on you.", "they have but i felt guilty that i was the reason my parents couldn't help them as much so its on my. my family has told them off so many times", "You were not the one that that got someone pregnant, at 18.

I never understand why people feel guilty about when people get what they justly deserve. He's an asshole, so why bend over backwards for an asshole. Block them on everything, it's hard at first.....but I am going on my 7th year of cutting family members off. It gets easier with time.....trust!", "You. Were. A. Child. You had no control over the whole situation and your parents had more responsibility and obligation towards you as their child who was still dependent on them. There was no way that they could have neglected you and your needs in favour of your nephew. \n\nYour brother and SIL need to learn that making adult decisions comes with adult consequences good or bad. You don't owe him or SIL *anything*. You have *nothing to feel guilty for*.", "Bud, you literally have no reason of guilt, your parents did their job with all their kids equally, when your brother turned 18, he made his life choices and your parents just couldn\u2019t help as much as he wanted. You should tell your therapist about this money issue, because you\u2019re being used and abused by your brother and his family and you\u2019re just letting them", "You are not the reason. \n\nHE DECIDED TO HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX.\n\nYour parents are obligated to take care of you until 18, and that is exactly what they did for him and you.\n\nStop giving him money and actually demand what you have given him already back.\n\nDon\u2019t let him manipulate you for his own actions.", "You didn't make those choices your parents did.  And it's pretty clear that no matter what your parents gave them they would have demanded more.", ">You didn't make those choices your parents did.\n\nThis, plus OPs parents had more responsibility and obligation to their minor child who was still  dependent on them at the time than their grandchild. They couldn't just neglect OP in favour of OPs brother's kid."]}
