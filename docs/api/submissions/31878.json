Aaron also insisted that she paid but she refused since she did not get to go. so, all of us ended up dividing the money and paying for her flight. \n\nit was not a hefty amount, but i still believed that it was not very fair. so, when we ended up meeting the next time, i told her i was sorry that she had to spend the night in an ER but she should have paid regardless of that. she did not say anything to me then, but went to Aaron and told him to stop talking to me as she felt \u201cinsulted\u201d and \u201cstingy\u201d the way i brought it up. all i said was that she should have paid. \n\nAaron told me I was being an AH and should apologize to her but i refused. so, AITA for asking her to pay her share? \n\nEDIT: we are NOT asking her to pay for anything other than her flight tickets and a pre-purchased event ticket!\n\nTLDR; friend\u2019s partner missed a trip because of being in the ER for a minor mishap, refuses to pay and called me an AH for saying she should have.", "created_utc": 1701105962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1858b49/aita_for_asking_my_friends_partner_to_pay_for_her/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His actions caused this extra cost on the trip. \n\nSide note: this girl is a moron for instantly, and likely forever, burning bridges with Aaron\u2019s friends. Nobody is ever going to fully accept her for future outings, and her presence will always been slightly unwelcome now.", "NTA and honestly I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t look to Aaron to pay her share since he\u2019s the one that wanted her there.", "Sucks all around but NTA. Personally I\u2019d ask her to pay for her airline ticket but never things like rental car or hotel as the ticket is an incurred extra cost for her specifically, but the room and car would have been split without her anyway if she had never planned to go (meaning you guys didn\u2019t incur any extra costs there on her account so if you expect her share of that you\u2019re asking *her* to subsidize *you*).", "NTA\n\nShe should pay. She's greedy and self-blind if she can seriously say that it's unfair of her to have to pay because she couldn't go, but fair that you all have to pay for her even though she didn't go.", "NTA. She is being stingey and it defies logic that you all had to absorb the cost of her disrupted travel. They are both being AHs.", "NTA. She should have paid for her portion. It\u2019s not right to ask you to pay for her trip just because she ended up not going.", "What exactly is included in her share? Air fare\u2026 her or Aaron\u2019s responsibilty, not everyone else\u2019s. If she would be sharing Aaron\u2019s room, then that\u2019s on him. Car\u2026 you would have had it anyway, so split it across those who actually went.", "NTA she's the one trying to force you to pay for her ticket because she didn't get to go, and she calls *you* stingy? She has no right to make you pay for her ticket.", "She should pay for her plane ticket because it's the sort of thing that must be bought before the trip and usually is non-refundable. It's her ticket, for her seat. It really should be nothing to do with the rest of you.\n\nShe should not contribute to the rental car since you would have rented the car anyway and the car usage is divided amongst all the people in it. \n\nShe should not contribute to the hotel for the same reason, although I think the hotel is a bit more ambiguous because what if she had planned to share a room with one person who was now left paying for the room alone because she wasn't present? \n\nUnfortunately, most of us have to learn eventually that if you front people the cost of a trip then this type of thing tends to happen. It can be difficult or impossible to get the money back. My husband has a rule that if he is doing a group purchase, he doesn't make the purchase until he has everyone's contribution in hand. He will notify people in advance, I am not buying the tickets until I have everyone's payment and all checks have been cleared. If it gets close to when he has to buy the tickets or lose them, he'll send out a follow-up email or text: I need to buy the tickets by 4 pm tomorrow. If you haven't yet paid me for your ticket, please ensure I have your payment by midnight tonight or I will go ahead and buy everyone else's ticket and you'll have to buy yours yourself. Or, if it's a group deal where you need at least X people, he'll send a message like, \"I only have 4 out of 5 payments, please let me know by midnight tonight whether you want me to buy your ticket at full price $XYZ or whether you would prefer not to be included in the trip, in which case I'll send your payment back to you\". \n\nYes this is a massive pain in the neck, especially as people tend to blame the organizer if he/she doesn't PERFECTLY word these messages to make clear what are the conditions for getting money back. It takes a very organized and clear-thinking person to not end up being treated like you're trying to scam them out of money for doing the massive unpaid favor of organizing a huge discount off their trip at financial risk to yourself.  So at some point he stopped organizing things at all because it was too much hassle and risk and just took the joy out of the event.\n\nThis is a subcategory of No Good Deed Goes Unpunished which I'll call \"If You Buy Other People's Tickets For Them Then You're Liable To Never Get Repaid.\"", "Aaron needs to pay her portion.

It's not your fault she got sick. Aaron is probably the biggest AH in the entire situation.", "NTA. If she booked a flight alone and missed it she\u2019d still have to pay. But that\u2019s for the flight. You guys would still have had to rent the car and get hotel rooms.", "NTA. The fact that she didn't want to pay is so wrong. Says a lot about her character. Aaron should've paid anyways.

But since she didn't go due to a medical emergency, she should only be responsible for specific costs incurred on her behalf, such as her plane ticket, any prepaid tour or ticket fees, and any additional costs actually incurred because she was planning on going, such as extra room charges or the price differential of a bigger suite rented to accommodate her.\n\nIf you rented the same car with her going as you had planned before you knew she was going, she shouldn't have to pay a share of that.", "ESH.\n\nIt's a medical emergency. It sucks, but it happens. \n\nAnd why are adults booking flights for other adults?
