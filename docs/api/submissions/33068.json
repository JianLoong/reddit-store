Great movie by the way, definitely recommend! But as we were walking up to give our tickets a group of 5-6 people ages 17-20 approximately walked in to buy tickets. They were loud while walking up and I was hoping they weren\u2019t also watching Wonka but of course they where. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, they happened to buy the group of seats right behind us. As a note, this was an 8pm showing and the theatre wasn\u2019t flooded by any means but a decent number of people were watching, at least 15 other people were in there with us. \n\n   Anyways, when we sit down, as the previews start playing they\u2019re immediately talking hella loud, laughing and joking like they\u2019re in their own living room. I\u2019m talking full on projected voice talking, commenting on everything in every preview and cracking jokes constantly. Now, normally I wouldn\u2019t care, it\u2019s the previews, whatever, but once the lights went down we expected them to hush. They did not hush. They continued commenting on the movies intro and being obnoxious for the first probably 5 minutes, I was about to stand up and say something when my boyfriend sitting next to me loudly said \u201cCan you guys shut the FUCK UP, PLEASE?\u201d. They quieted down and didn\u2019t talk louder than a whisper the rest of the movie, and we thought we\u2019d taken care of it. \n\n  After the movie played as they were leaving I noticed them flipping us off behind our backs and staring at us as we walked to our car. On the drive home we started wondering if maybe we could have handled it better, or worded it nicer, or something, and generally whether or not we\u2019re TAHs.

Movie theatre etiquette is very simple to grasp, and anybody who doesn\u2019t follow it is deserving of a \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d I have told people this many times. when i saw Avatar 2 there was this couple behind me who were literally talking nonstop. like 20 minutes talking, 30 seconds quiet, then back to talking)  and i whipped my head around and harsh whispered \u201chave you ever been to a movie theatre before? shut your fucking mouths.\u201d and i did not hear a peep out of them after that. non-assholish, and also gets results", "NTA. They are assholes for even acting like that in the first place. Assholeness gets met with assholeness end of story. Glad you weren\u2019t a doormat.", "NTA. It was disrespectful to everyone else paying money to watch the movie to be speaking in regular conversational voices.

But you could have started with a politer 'would you mind keeping it down during the movie' rather than going straight for the nuclear option.  \n\nClearly they are also AHs for being insensitive to everybody else in the cinema.", "While I empathize with your plight, being polite when telling the group to be quiet was the way to go. The teens shouldn\u2019t have been talking, but your boyfriend shouldn\u2019t have yelled like that. Instead, he should have said (along the lines), \u201ccan y\u2019all be quiet, please; you\u2019re causing a disturbance.\u201d Because of that, I\u2019m going to go with ESH. \n\nI do have to admit, his yelling at them was effective.", "Yes you could have handled it better therefore ESH.", "How? \n\nDont just say shit like that without presenting a solution.", " I don\u2019t want to sound old but Gen Z kids are annoying as shit in movie theaters. I don\u2019t even go anymore. Every movie I\u2019ve watched in the theaters in the last few years were annoying ass kids just on their phones and talking super loudly. I don\u2019t even understand why they even go if they\u2019re not even going to watch.", "NTA.  My cousin and I had a similar experience at the theatre when we went to see The Lion King. Group of 4/5 Chinese girls seated directly behind us started chatting in their native language the second the curtain came up. First my cousin asked them to be quiet, a few minutes later I did the same. When their chatter started a third time we turned round together and said loudly \"be quiet\" there wasn't another word out of them the whole evening.", "NTA...\n\nI hate people like that...Anyone who talks during a movie with others that aren't their party in the theater can burn in the fires of a thousand suns as far as I'm concerned...\n\nI rarely go to the actual movies anymore, but when I do I try my best to wait a week after launch and find a Tuesday or Wednesday and go to an early show...\n\nTheaters, even for popular new movies, tend to be really empty during the first show on a midweek early afternoon...lol", "i took my nephew to see the FNAF movie and this dude was licking his fingers and smacking his lips SOOO loud, which his friends were encouraging, to the point that my nephew asked me to say something. people have gone completely brain dead when it comes to public decency. Edit: forgot to say NTA.", "Title sounds like a karma farm. Who the fuck is going to vote Y T A here?", "NTA\n\nIf they want to talk loudly throughout a movie, they can wait until it streams and watch at home", "NTA. I've done this plenty of times. I wish there was someone in the theatre to monitor this type of thing. We had to go grab someone one time because 2 teenagers were making out and getting very close to doing more.", "NTA.\n\nIn my own limited experience it seems to be becoming a trend for people (usually younger adults) to talk during movies in theaters. It annoys the hell out of me and ruins the experience. It's just so rude and entitled. I've gotten the same nasty looks or seem them give nasty looks and yell back at people who call them out. Not pleasant.", "The last movie I saw in the theater was Deadpool 2, some girl and her mom next to me kept taking pics of their food, I had asked if they take pictures after it is digested, she said \"no, that is disgusting\" I told her if she takes another pic, I am throwing her phone to the front of the theater. People these days are fucking annoying.", "ESH. Them for talking. BF for basic rudeness. First the Seinfeld half-turn. Then a polite \u201cexcuse me, we can\u2019t hear the movie.\u201d Next, a visit to a theatre employee or a change of seat.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve reported them to the theater and let them kick em out. There is a chain in Texas that doesn\u2019t eff around about talking", "NTA. Many ppl don\u2019t know or care about theater etiquette.", "No kidding we don\u2019t even do that when watching movies at home.", "Exactly, this right here.  The people who behave that way RELY on most people being too timid to confront them about it.  Because that gives them the freedom to behave however they want. Mostly, they\u2019re cowards though, and back down from the tiniest amount of pushback", "Yeah. I will say, teenagers have always been a bit obnoxious at theaters, but it seems like no one even tries to hide it? Whispers have become normal talking voices. Discretely checking your phone and texting a bit has become phones out at full brightness, even watching VIDEOS during the movie. Even shit that was acceptable--rustling bags of candy and popcorn--has gotten worse because people will loudly eat food even at tense, quiet moments which I feel like people avoied before?\n\nThe shame element has been gone.\n\nAlso, I can literally hear people's attention spans running out. Saw a two hour movie on Tuesday and ten minutes in my seat started shakingn because the teenager next to me started fidgeting and writhing in their seat and kept reaching forward to grab their phone.", "Oh I'm sorry I thought this was am I the asshole not present me a solution. Why do you think OP wonders if they could have handled it better? Maybe instead of saying SHUT THE FUCK UP in a crowded movie theatre they could have just said SHUT UP. Message is the same without stooping to their level of tastelessness.", "Movie theaters have a whole ass scene where they politely ask you to put away your phones and be quiet for everyone's sake. Why would anyone assume that being nice to these rude ass people work in the first place? \n\nMovies are so expensive now a days, I truly don't understand why anyone pays to then sit there and talk for fucking hours. Stay home or stfu! \n\nAfter the quarantine I swear movie theater etiquette has gone down the fucking toilet.", "Telling someone to please be quiet would be the nice way. Telling someone to Shut Up is direct. Yelling FUCK in a theater, that probably has parents with kids in it, is also rude.", "Having your main issue with the word 'fuck' is juvenile. There is no reason to be nice to people who are talking loudly and using their phone in a movie theatre.", "The word fuck is the least concerning thing for kids who are already likely on the Internet. But that's assuming there were any kids there to begin with.", "Having to use the word Fuck to get your point across is juvenile. It's also inconsiderate to other people that can hear you.", "It seriously isn't more inconsiderate than a bunch of kids being loud during a movie, the difference is yelling FUCK both has a purpose and stop ringing in your ears in two seconds.", "That is exactly my point and why I said ESH. They responded to people being inconsiderate in an inconsiderate manner. Could they have gotten their point across without having to yell SHUT THE FUCK UP. Absolutely. Adults do it all the time.", "Adults also say fuck way more often than children, and vocabulary is not a benchmark of maturity or adulthood."]}
