Great movie by the way, definitely recommend! But as we were walking up to give our tickets a group of 5-6 people ages 17-20 approximately walked in to buy tickets. They were loud while walking up and I was hoping they weren\u2019t also watching Wonka but of course they where. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, they happened to buy the group of seats right behind us. As a note, this was an 8pm showing and the theatre wasn\u2019t flooded by any means but a decent number of people were watching, at least 15 other people were in there with us. \n\n   Anyways, when we sit down, as the previews start playing they\u2019re immediately talking hella loud, laughing and joking like they\u2019re in their own living room. I\u2019m talking full on projected voice talking, commenting on everything in every preview and cracking jokes constantly. Now, normally I wouldn\u2019t care, it\u2019s the previews, whatever, but once the lights went down we expected them to hush. They did not hush. They continued commenting on the movies intro and being obnoxious for the first probably 5 minutes, I was about to stand up and say something when my boyfriend sitting next to me loudly said \u201cCan you guys shut the FUCK UP, PLEASE?\u201d. They quieted down and didn\u2019t talk louder than a whisper the rest of the movie, and we thought we\u2019d taken care of it. \n\n  After the movie played as they were leaving I noticed them flipping us off behind our backs and staring at us as we walked to our car. On the drive home we started wondering if maybe we could have handled it better, or worded it nicer, or something, and generally whether or not we\u2019re TAHs.

Movie theatre etiquette is very simple to grasp, and anybody who doesn\u2019t follow it is deserving of a \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d I have told people this many times. when i saw Avatar 2 there was this couple behind me who were literally talking nonstop. like 20 minutes talking, 30 seconds quiet, then back to talking)  and i whipped my head around and harsh whispered \u201chave you ever been to a movie theatre before? shut your fucking mouths.\u201d and i did not hear a peep out of them after that. non-assholish, and also gets results", "NTA.
