I told them that i could buy them plane tickets there and buy them a suite there for their honeymoon. They were both excited for that.\n\nThat same night, i bought them plane tickets for hawaii, a honeymoon suite at a hotel for two weeks and a reservation to a fancy restaurant there. I payed for their honeymoon, and told my cousin she didn\u2019t need to pay me back.\n\nAfter the wedding, my cousin posted her and her husband in hawaii for their honeymoon. My mom and sister were furious. They thought that they would go to florida bc her MIL lives there. My mom and sister called her saying that she is selfish and she needs to care more about her family. I said to my cousin i\u2019m sorry for what my mom and sister said to her, she said it wasn\u2019t my fault and thanked me for the honeymoon.\n\nAt a party last week, my cousin\u2019s MIL came and told everyone that i payed for the honeymoon. My sister started screaming at me saying that me and our cousin are selfish bitches and that we need to learn how to care and love our family. I said, \u201cshe and her husband should decide where they go, it was their big day, and for the honeymoon, they decided to go to Hawaii. I also said that if i told her where to go for vacation or for her honeymoon she would be pissed.\n\nMy sister said that\u2019s different. at that point i left.
