Wtf??   \nThe man is cheating. Period.", "NTA this is not the first time it happend. THis this the first time you caught him.

Sorry but its easy to be sweet and loving when things are easy that doesn't mean much.  Man is weak", "You - NTA\n\nBf - TA\n\nYou didn't freak out.  Don't let him frame the discussion.", "I can't imagine consistely fighting with someone for an entire year and staying together. He's not the sweetest most caring and loving - how he's acting now *is who he is.* \n\nSoft Y-T-A because you're being an A to yourself by keeping this AH in your life. Definitely NTA because your stxbf is a massive jerk.\n\nWishing you peace and freedom.", "Omg dump him. That *is* cheating. You\u2019re NTA and he\u2019s a prick!", "NTA. That definitely isn\u2019t \u201cnothing\u201d. You don\u2019t say things like that to someone who you aren\u2019t bedding or trying to bed. \n\nYou say you fight all the time.

Also if you get to the 'let me check your phone'' stage either break up or get help.", "Find a man that sends you memes, not schemes.\n\nNTA and get your money from the house and ditch. He only resents it because he knew he wasn't going to stay in the relationship long ago. Instead of saying that he decided to get the house and emotionally love someone else.", "ESH - neither of you sound like you want to be in this relationship despite your opening lines. So you fucked up and bought a house together and you're stuck with each other? You both have options. Sell, rent it out, buy one person out of it are some. \n\nYou can try and salvage this (dunno why) but pretty it's obvious he's moving on. If I was fighting with someone for a year plus there's no way I'd want to stay with them like damn. \n\nWhat's the end game here? Do you want to fix it? Are you okay with accepting it's done? I mean he hasn't cheated on you yet but the intent is there so give it time. I'm just so much more perplexed as to why you're still together in the first place if you can't have an interaction without ending in arguments.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are an AH for snooping.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
