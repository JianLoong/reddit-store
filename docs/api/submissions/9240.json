I told her she knows that isn't possible. That's not how custody agreements work. Besides, how would that make my kids feel? She said she just gave birth, so her feelings are important. I said I'm not flaking on my kids, so we need to figure something else out.\n\nFriday when it was time for me to pick up all the kids my wife was napping. I didn't want to potentially wake her, so I told my oldest (he's 19) to hold the baby until I got back. When I got back with all the kids, my oldest and wife were screaming at each other. The best I can tell is that she woke up and went looking for me, my son told her where I went, she called me a thoughtless prick, my son called her a hateful witch, and then they started screaming at each other.\n\nI got the kids to all go outside for a bit while I talked to my wife. She said I was an unbelievably selfish asshole that couldn't even give her a break for one weekend. She said none of this would have happened if I hadn't insisted on picking up my younger kids. She said she wanted my oldest to leave, but I said that wasn't an option.\n\nShe locked herself in our room.

But she does not get to pick and choose when you are a father to ANY of your children, and PARTICULARLY not so you can prioritize her as an adult. \n\nYou were correct that that is not how custody agreements work, but more importantly, that's not how parenting works.\n\nIf she could not handle being a parent/stepparent to a household with five children under even the most stressful of circumstances, then she should not have married a man who had four kids as a woman who had one of her own, and she CERTAINLY shouldn't have gone and had another one. \n\nYou also mention that it was, in fact, your YOUNGEST children whom you were picking up for custodial time, which makes this even more horrifying. That your youngest kids  from your previous relationship already get the least amount of time with you and she wants to shunt them aside now when they are inconvenient is hugely problematic . . . and is only going to get worse as your new baby grows and becomes more active and needy. You absolutely need to reiterate to her that NO CHILD in this blended family should or shall be prioritised over any other, and that she does not get to deprive any child of parental time because she feels like there are too many of them. Again, that's not how family works. You do not temporarily rid yourself of a few kids because they are inconvenient. \n\nYou are NTA, but wow is this going to be a problem, because you just had a SIXTH CHILD with a woman who genuinely believes that it's okay to shove your other young children out the door for her personal comfort.", "NTA, it's unreasonable for her to ask you to blow off your visitation time at the last minute like that.  \n\nAre the kids wild or difficult?  It seems like the older ones, at least, could be a huge help taking care of things while she focuses on recoving.  Your son was willing to mind the baby while she slept, for example.", "NTA. Your kids didn't choose for you to have another baby and shouldn't be put out because of it. Step parenting and kids from other relationships can be a challenging issue but your wife is the one being selfish.", "[removed]", "NTA. You have a custody agreement.  You also cannot abandon your children, yes your wife is tired and giving birth is not easy, but how would your youngest children feel if you didn't pick them up, that's how children start to feel like they are being replaced in the family.", "NTA.", "NTA they are your kids and it's the custody agreement. Sounds like you and the kids are all trying. Are yall doing the housework and such, too, yeah? She's not expected to look after the kids that came for the weekend?", "NTA. \n\nIf this was something she was thinking about then she needed to propose it weeks ago so that you could make a plan with your ex for a change of the weekend and for her to make arrangements if she had plans or needs to go to work. This was not an emergency. Also I notice that her own child was not sent away and it sounds like your two at home full time are older (and helpful). So the \"three kids\" comment is out of line. The 19 year old definitely doesn't need adult supervision and depending on the age of your other child, they might need it either.", "NTA. What message would these two young kids get if you ditched them as soon as there's a new baby in the house? You did the right thing here.\n\nYour wife's exhaustion and overwhelm are understandable, but there are plenty of other ways to keep the house quiet. Give your teenager some cash and tell him to take his siblings to a movie or something.", "NTA\n\nYou were being a good Dad. Picking up your kids to maintain their routine is the best option so they don't start feeling like the new baby is pushing them out. I understand your wife is feeling overwhelmed but she needs to find another way to cope that doesn't hurt your other children. She might need a friend/mother/therapy/spa day or for you to handle the kids while she takes time alone and that is valid. Expecting you to ditch your kids is not.", "NTA. They are ALL your kids and you can't play favorites. If she was having that much of an issue she should have left for the weekend, preferably to a relative's house but if there was no other option a hotel. I get it, I have had kids, she is tired and bleeding, but the other kids can't be left to feel they are being replaced by the new baby. It's not like you were refusing to help her.", "NTA - it would be one thing if you were asking her to watch your kids right after she gave birth, but your son is literally helping her. She doesn't get to unilaterally ban your kids from the house just because there's a new baby.", "NTA. When you marry someone who has kids, I feel like you should accept them as an unconditional part of the family. If mom needs a break, maybe OP can take all the kids out for the day. But it's incredibly unfair to single out the younger ones. Unless they're still young enough to be in diapers, then I'm all in on her side.", "NTA.  Continue to not put up with this behavior.  Don\u2019t even give her the opportunity to pull the \u201cthis is your family now\u201d shit.  Shut it down now.", "INFO: Who predominantly takes care of of your children when you have custody? Your wife?", "Nta.  And it shows what she thinks of your kids.  That they are an inconvenience to her and disposable.  To those that say YTA, this is what families do.  When you have a newborn and other kids, you have to juggle them all.  If they were her kids she wouldn\u2019t be sending them away.", "Look, it's simple. You had custody agreements in place for a reason, you can't just flake on your kids just because your wife is feeling overwhelmed. \n\nAs for your wife calling you names and locking herself in the room, it's just a typical case of postpartum hormones and exhaustion talking. Give her some time to calm down and come to her senses.", "Absolutely NTA - you\u2019re 100% correct sticking to the agreement and seeing your children.", "NTA", "NTA. New baby does not trump older children. *They are still and always will be your children, her tantrum or not*.\n\nI'm sure things are hard for her right now, but you two should have thought of that before you decided to have *six children*. She doesn't get to pick and choose what children can be in the house for what times. She doesn't get to decide what children of yours you will parent and what one's you won't.\n\nHonestly, a little of the blame is on you for having so many kids and not having the conversation about plans *before* bringing a new child into the home. But you are doing the right thing as a father and not alienating your other children for the new baby. Keep it up, and protect your children from your wife, they don't deserve her shitty attitude.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re your children. They should be the top priority. You have an older son. Give them money to go to the movies, park, etc. \n\nBest solution was to probably preplan with your ex to trade dates. I know it\u2019s not always possible. Also, maybe your relationship with your ex isn\u2019t good. I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing this if you believe it could be used as amok for a new custody arrangement.", "No. NTA. She has to realize that your other kids are as important to you as hers is. It sounds like she\u2019s already trying to carve out space for you to put them on the back burner.", "NTA.  Your youngest children deserve to have time with you.  Your wife is going to have to get used to it.  Stand your ground.", "NTA. She made choices, deliberate choices and now she has to deal with them. She decided to have her 1st child, then she decided to date and marry a man with 4 kids. Finally your wife, a grown woman and mother, decided to create and have another child with you. Also custody agreements don't have a clause saying when the new wife has a kid the other ones don't get their weekends. That giving your ex ammunition for courts to lower your visitation or make it supervised.", "NTA for being a responsible parent. You were correct when \"I said I'm not flaking on my kids, so we need to figure something else out\" but the issue is that neither of you figured anything else out. Yes, you had to get your kids, you are right to prioritize upholding your legal custody agreement over her \"feelings\" but then what? Your oldest is an adult, could he take some or all of the younger kids out for a while? Are there grandparents who could take them the next day for a few hours (your parents, hers, an aunt/uncle, friend of the family)? Your wife knew about your kids before she had this new baby and I assume at no point did you agree to stop parenting some of your children because of the one being born, so where is your wife's expectations coming from? Could her unreasonable behaviour be due to postpartum depression? Are your wife's needs being met and is there anything you can do to help? Is her mother around and could she be a good support right now? Her interaction with your eldest was also wildly inappropriate. If my significant other spoke that way about me in front of my adult child, they'd get a lot more than an insult in response. I hope you can find some solutions here OP. Good luck!", "NTA. This is what happens when you have a blended family. Your older children from different relationships are not less important than your new baby. Wild she send away her own older child(ren)? Don\u2019t think so. So she doesn\u2019t get to say that your other children can\u2019t be there for your scheduled time.", "NTA.  Your wife is though.", "NTA she knew what she was getting into when she started a relationship with you. She's being unreasonable by demanding you to put your children aside like they're an inconvenience.", "NTA, especially now that I see you posted their ages. Your youngest two are 10 and 7, that's more than old enough to understand the need to play quieter inside the house or play outside. Your wife needs to take a massive chill pill. And yeah, I know she just gave birth. That's not an excuse to try and ban two kids who aren't toddlers from the house just because she gave birth.", "I don't think this dismisses her behavior at all but the day 3-4 post-partum hormone crash was wild. Once I was past it, I was shocked at how out of control I felt. Maybe she is going through something similar. Hopefully it will pass and you will be able to talk this out.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to flake out on your kids. Also her expecting to get a \u201cbreak\u201d is a bit unrealistic considering there is a new kid to deal with.", "NTA", "Oooofff, I\u2019m gonna come out and be the odd one out and say ESH. Here\u2019s why.\n\nYou are NTA for abiding by your custody arrangements and not trying to flake at short notice. It\u2019s absolutely unreasonable to bail on your kids like that with only a short amount of time to give notice.\n\nYou ARE the asshole, as is your partner, for not making plans in advance to giving birth to provide an atmosphere as relaxing & most conducive to recovering during a traumatic & exhausting period. \n\nI think you should have had ALL your other kids at alternative arrangements if possible for a week or so while you settled in, got into a routine and your wife recovered. The time to do that was about 3-6 months prior to giving birth. Let the other kids know why, plan for the time they\u2019ll all get to meet their new sibling.\n\nFrankly I understand your partner to a point. I can\u2019t think of anything worse than having a house THAT crowded when I\u2019m trying to recover and settle into the newborn routine.\n\nI\u2019m astonished that this didn\u2019t occur to either of you prior to literally a day or so before the kids were due home.", "INFO: what is your relationship like with your ex?

And it\u2019s troubling that she wants you to just toss them aside for the new baby..", "NTA. You rightly recognized your obligation to your existing children. While your wife was out of line for asking you to forgo your parenting time because another child has been born, I would caution you to grant a little forgiveness as she is likley very overwhelmed, and struggling to adjust. make sure she has as much help/support as you can provide right now to help lessen her load. That postpartum period SUCKS. I would also recommend having a conversation with her once everyones feelings have cooled, and the kids are not present (like when everyones in bed). Make it clear that the kids ALWAYS come first. Both yours, hers, and the new baby and any others who come along. She also needs to apologize to your eldest.", "NTA...you should have noted in the original post that your kids that live with you are all teenagers! It's not like she has to change their diapers and tend to their every need. In fact, the 19 year old is old enough to help and watch the newborn! That is an extra set of hands! I get that it probably gets a little loud but geez she even has the ability to go and nap and not worry about the newborn! I say this as a mother of 4, all young and never had the opportunity to take a break when we brought the next one home because they were all little and needed us. Even the 16 year old can help out a little; not that anyone should be forced to \"babysit\" but with large families, you sometimes need a little help, like \"hey, 16 year old, can you hold the baby so I can get the casserole into the oven\" type of help.\n\nYou're wife is hormonal and I get that. If this is out of the norm for her personality,  I'd look out for signs of Postpartum depression.  Don't be too hard on her as far as her reaction though.

By the time you made no advance plans for them and the date rolled around, you couldn't help picking them up. However:\n\nAny sane family with multiple older children makes arrangements for who looks after the other kids for a few days following the birth. Most who have only one older child do so. You should have had all this settled *months* before your wife actually bore your latest child!! It could be their other parent if you two could agree on that, or it could be somebody on your side of the family. They could even be brought over to meet the new baby, but with someone else as primary caregiver to them for the occasion, and then take them back someplace else when they began getting restless.\n\nIf your wife had given birth on a day when you had the older children with you, what would you have done?

Does your wife think her feelings matter more than you being a parent to all of your children. She made a choice to be a relationship with someone who already had 4 children. You as a couple made a choice to have another child knowing that you already have 5 kids between you. The notion that you would forgo picking up your children and spending time with because she has just given birth is ridiculous. Giving birth doesn't mean you stop being a parent to the children that you have. Also she had nine months to bring this up and figure out a plan. She has been pregnant before. She knows what is like and what to expect afterwards. Normally I would have sympathy but not for someone saying don't pick up your kids during their scheduled custody time just because you and her made a choice to have another baby. Now that it's here it doesn't get priority over your other children. You need to figure out how to be their for all the children you choose to bring into this world.", "ESH. You could have respected her feelings and switched the weekends. She just gave birth and based on the age of her other kid, it's been a while since her last  birthing rodeo and she might no longer be in her 20s so it's a lot harder to recover. She's YTA to herself for deciding to reproduce with someone who has already produced multiple children with multiple women especially if she finds a house full of kids unbearable. I hope you at least don't expect her to do all the work around the house and clean and cook for your kids.", "YTA. There\u2019s a commutation issue here.

It's not hard to negotiate around huge events, like both, holidays, graduations, etc. You can arrange for some recovery time for her and some bonding time for you both with the baby.

She was only two, so she had no understanding of what was going on until she got home and was introduced to the baby. \n\nOP's wife just went through the toughest physical job a body can do. I may not personally agree with her choice, but she's still entitled to have her recovery period however *she* needs it for a while. In some cultures, new mothers are pampered for a month after they give birth, to the point of being carried everywhere instead of walking, and never asked to do any work besides nursing and bonding with the baby. \n\nAmericans have a deeply sick approach to childbirth, prioritizing everybody except the woman who does the work. It shows in every way from our abortion laws to our parental leave policies. This is just another aspect of it -- one more father who was never taught to show his wife the respect and care she deserves after she gives birth to his child.", "Because he didn't make earlier arrangements for who was going to look after all those kids. The oldest can help with the baby; the baby is easy. But very few 15-16 year olds will listen to their 19 year old sibling, and it's not fair to ask the oldest to try. And no one 19-year-old is likely to be able to handle that *many* active, mobile younger children (as distinguished from a newborn, which basically sleeps when it's not hungry or wet) by themself, especially to a degree of discipline which allows a recovering patient to rest in quiet. \n\nThere should have been *at least* one more person, a full adult who was not either the mother or father of the newborn, whose only job was to keep the other kids' needs met and help them find quiet activities that won't wake up Mama or baby. Preferably two, with that many kids, though the oldest can be one of them if he's willing and good with younger kids. And it should have been set up months in advance. \n\nThe father didn't think enough about his wife's needs -- even after he's had several children already! -- to get her the kind of help during her recovery that any normal first-time father knows to obtain. That's either due to total lack of comprehension or total lack of caring, and I fault him for either.", "Yes, forever. That's it.

And you can speculate all you\u2019d like but personally I read the post and use that info.\n\nImmediately after waking up and discovering her husband wasn\u2019t in the house she called him a thoughtless prick and then proceeded to fight with the 19 yo over something he had no part in other than to help. Then when hubby gets home she immediately lays into him about how he\u2019s unbelievably selfish, this is all his fault, and none of it would\u2019ve happened if mot for him. \n\nNow let\u2019s check the notes, \n\n- husband did not immediately drop his younger kids to acquiesce his wife\u2019s unreasonable request the day before it was scheduled.\n\n- he continued to be a good father by picking up his younger kids and making sure the youngest was in safe care.\n\n- got absolutely reamed out. \n\n- got told she wanted to kick out one of his children.\n\nIdk about you but I see a lot of wifey being unreasonable. Kicking out 19 yo and pausing visits w the two youngest is literally ignoring 3 or his 4 existing children so he can focus on their new baby is an awful idea. I notice there doesn\u2019t seem to be ANY problems with her child, just his. Like I said, I really hope this is hormone fuelled and things will calm down in a little bit so they can continue to blend their families and enjoy the newborn, BUT wife needs to understand that she is being unreasonable.", "That\u2019s not very charitable to the father. They are his kids, not hers. Why would we think that he expects a postpartum stepmother to parent them? And he has never said that.

She mostly just seems worried about noise.", "I\u2019m with you on abortion rights and parental leave.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for a mother to demand that a father kick his kids out of the house. And I wouldn\u2019t accommodate that kind of request. My kids know that they are always welcome at my home. Always. It\u2019s part of creating a safe environment for kids so they know that they always have a home and an engaged parent, and that they are put first. I tell my partner that my kids have to come first because it\u2019s the nature of the role, and I expect him to put the kids first before me, too. If they want grandma to come over and help out, great! Or if they want me to tell grandma that we need a little space right now, great! If they want me to make all their meals and let them rest in bed? Great!

If he had insisted -- two or three months ago, when all of this should have been decided in the first place -- that he would be glad to bring in grandparents or friends of the family to make sure the kids were under control and out of her hair while she recuperated, but that the kids would be cared for at the home, and not anywhere else, I wouldn't be so contemptuous of him. \n\nBut he didn't do a single thing to get them sorted out. He just *left* it. No wonder she had a meltdown. She's probably having pretty serious postpartum depression and everyone looks a lot worse than it is, and he's not helping her one bit.\n\nIncidentally, my kids come first too, and my husband and I took vows to them when we married, as well as to each other, in order to reinforce that. But one of the first things they learned was \"Safety comes before comfort, and comfort before fun.\" \n\nThis woman is recovering from the hardest job a body can do. Her safety -- and the baby's -- is involved in her getting proper after-care. The kids' comfort and fun should legitimately be expected to take a back seat to that, and they are all old enough to understand that by now.", "Here's my thing..mom and dad both knew that adding a new baby would be hard, they should have prepared a plan in advance.

One child is our birth child together (after many many miscarriages) and the other nine were all adopted either through the foster care system (we fostered many children), private adoption, or child abandonment.

Every time I type that I swear I can hear some reddit readers scream. \n\nYou simply do not marry a man with children & then decide you don't want the children he came with.  By the same token, if a man marries a woman with children he better man up, suck it up and decide to love those kids like crazy.  \n\nWe all have choices in life.  Look very rarely does a woman not have a way to prevent pregnancy in today's society. And let's be honest if a man doesn't want kids he can get a vasectomy a heck of a lot cheaper than a lifetime supply of birth control  pills for the woman.  And if he's so scared of getting snipped he can stop at almost every store or mini mart heck even the men's room in most bars and buy condoms.  So babies are rarely not someone's choice.  (We don't need to discuss rape, incest etc we all know that's not what I'm talking about.)    So most of us choose to have the children we have.   Or at least our partners chose.  \n\nWith the choices come the consequences.
