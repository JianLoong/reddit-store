Our garbage bins had been emptied the night before so not seeing any other kittens was a bit of a concern. We went door to door informing people that we had found this kitten, telling them to check their bins, just in case. No other kittens were found and more importantly nobody came forward to claim him.\n\nHaving not found any leads and with a hungry fuzzy infant to deal with, I got to work, bottlefeeding religiously, toileting, keeping the baby warm etc. I've now well and truly bonded with him, he's integrating with my other cats, I'm getting him his first vaccine this week. All is well and he's thriving.\n\nThe problem here is, yesterday my husband saw some kids at the top of our street playing with some kittens that looked suspiciously like my kitten, so he took a stroll back up to investigate and he then found out the origin of the kitten.\n\nThe kids' cat had given birth to a litter of 7, the two girls were each going to be allowed to keep one, and the others were being adopted out to other family members. The youngest kid, a 5 year old girl had chosen my kitten basically when he was born. At the two week point, their cousins were coming over to pick their kittens out (not take them, but pick them beforehand) and the little girl got worried that they'd choose her kitten. She and her sister snuck the kitten away from his littermates and found the best hiding place ever for him....my garbage bin.\n\nHe would have only been in that bin about 10 minutes before I found him and brought him inside, and it was maybe an hour before we started knocking on doors, but by then the family had gone out for dinner so when we knocked on that door there was no answer. The girls had come back for the kitten about 20 minutes or so after they hid him, when the cousins had chosen their cats, but our bin was inside by then, and they were too afraid to knock on our door or come clean to their parents because they thought they'd get in trouble.\n\nAnyhow, while the little girl would really like her kitten back, I feel I've put in all the hard work being his caregiver and raising him, and it would absolutely break my heart to give him up now, but at the same time, this would likely break the little girl's heart.\n\nSo would I be the asshole for keeping my little man?\n\nEdit: The issue has resolved itself. I let the little girls and their parents come over for a playdate, and he apparently plays a lot more roughly than his siblings do (probably because he rough houses with my 2yo kelpie) and he bit the older sister hard enough to draw blood, which ended the play date. I don't think they want him now.", "created_utc": 1698361875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h9hh4/wibta_for_keeping_a_5yo_girls_kitten/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The issue is the parents.\nA living breathing kitten was missing. A kitten that was extremely important to their daughter. And they responded by... going out to dinner? No effort at all to track this baby down? \n\nIf you return the kitten to the family, it may technically be the girl's cat. But the parents will be responsible for it. And they have one unspayed cat breeding indiscriminately and one lost kitten they don't seem to have put any effort into finding. I'd be very skeptical that they'd give him the best care possible.", "No. That kitten could have died in there and the parents should have kept an eye on them. They should have noticed one was missing when the cousins came picking the kittens, they should have asked the kids where the hell that kitten had gone, then, knock on your door and ask you. \n\nIf it had been me in their situation, I would not have going out, knowing a helpless kitten, I was responsible for, was somewhere, on its own. \n\nThat kitten is better off without them.\n\nWhile I understand the little girls perspective, it is the parents that are to blame for this. They should tell the girls to share the one kitten they still have (poor thing, also, poor mommy cat) and that's that. \n\nIf they cared enough, they had plenty of time in 2 weeks to investigate. Damn, I would have flyered the whole neighbourhood. Everyone was going to look for that kitten, if it was mine. But, I don't think I would be that deep in because children shouldn't be left alone with kittens that are very vulnerable. \n\nYou keep it.", "NTA\n\nAs another poster said, she\u2019s obviously not mature enough to have a cat. I\u2019ll also add, its been 5 whole weeks, if the parents haven\u2019t come around to collect it, or even look for it (knowing it\u2019s been missing) then they likely don\u2019t care either.", "NTA this is entirely on the kid\u2019s shitty parents. You saved the kitty, you keep the kitty.", "This is a tough one. \n\nI'm gonna go with NTA, but neither is the kid.  The kid is 5.  The parents on the other hand, should have (possibly even could have?) made it clear to their own kids, that they got first choice, and that the cousins could pick from the remainder of the litter?  Instead they miscommunicated to their children, created a fear-anxiety based scenario, and additionally the kids were \"too afraid to knock or come clean to their parents\" tells me something as well. \n\nI think you'd be better off keeping the kitten and letting the little girl know she's welcome to visit it.", "NTA\n\nThat kitten ended up in a garbage can. I would have called animal control and complained after I found out who the owners were. \n\nThe kid can just deal with not having the cat.", "NTA. A five-year-old should not be in charge of a life. If the parents can't be bothered to teach them, then you'll have to. By not returning the kitten, who would have died if you had been less attentive and caring.", "I believe that cat found you. You are it\u2019s owner now. NTA", "NTA\n\nNote,  it's your kitten now. Anyone immature enough to hide a kitten in a trash bin is to immature to own a kitten.", "NTA, that honour goes to the parents. You've invested time and money into this kitten now- it's yours.", "NTA i feel bad for her but cause shes five, itll be \u201cher cat\u201d but not at all her responsibility, and the ones who would be responsible (parents) have clearly shown theyre not. keep your lil guy!", "I just want to say that the resolution here is fantastic.", "NTA, you belong to that kitten now", "NTA \n\nNeither is the little girl\n\nHer parents are big AH's here. My parents got me a kitten at 5 yo & that led to a lifelong unconditional love & cats have been in my life for 40 years now.\n\nLittle kittens left alone in those circumstances often ends in tragedy. You took him & saved a life, this is your kitten now\n\nI'm sorry for that girls \ud83d\udc94 but young children need the loving guidance of responsible caring adults as well as consistent oversight\n\n\nThose parents are irresponsible AH's, for  not doing what needs to be done to look after animals to do their best to make sure they thrive\n\nAnd for breaking a child's heart.\n\nThat they went out instead of looking for that little kitten/caused distress to mom cat...hard YTA to those parents. And spay your mom cat.", "NTA. And I would say to keep the kitten. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t blame the 5 year old for not fully understanding the consequences of what could\u2019ve happened to the kitten when she, and her sister, did what they did\u2026whether it would\u2019ve died by suffocation, heat exhaustion, or by truck compactor doesn\u2019t matter, I do hold her culpable for doing what she did in the first place. By age 5 , you should 100% know what a trash can is, and what it is used for. And, if you know those two things, then you would have the basic understanding that it is not okay to do what they did. A kitten is not trash. \n\nAlso, out of sheer curiosity, I wonder how old the older sister was? Because with all this talk of what the 5 year old did, or did not, do, people are forgetting that this older sibling was also involved in the action. \n\nEven the kids aside though, people bring up good points about the parents. All of this would have been avoided if they had just explained to the youngest daughter that she and the sister get first dibs to pick. Especially if the youngest is still going through a possession phase. If they did not have the logical foresight to see the lack of doing so becoming an issue, then I\u2019m not sure they are of the right mental capacity to take care of the kitten in lieu of the kids should the need arise.

She just wanted that special kitty and you gotta realize her intentions were never heinous although we all know something bad could've happened to the cat. It's unfair to act like this kid should've known better, she's 5.
