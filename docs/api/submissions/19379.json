I'm always amazed when family act as if they are entitled to professional services for free. You're providing a family discount.  That is more than enough of a wedding gift.\n\nBut takes the cake in this case is that they wanted a gift from the registry in addition to free services.\n\nSo, to summarize: you get to work for free rather than to enjoy the ceremony and the party,  as well as to give a gift as the price of admission.

They would probably underestimate the cost of the equipment by many magnitudes and if they knew wouldn't understand why you need more than one lens.", "NTA\n\nI don't know what it is about photographers, but people often seem to think that you owe them your labor for free - and as you point out, these people don't have the same expectations of a plumber or electrician. Presumably at some level, they don't think of being a photographer as actual work.\n\nYour work has value. You offered them a steep discount on your normal rates as a gift. They chose not to accept.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't hire my sister to work my wedding. I'd want her to be present as a guest, and celebrating as a guest, and being in the photos, and not behind the camera.

Whole bunch of entitlement from the wedding couple.", "NTA - who wants to work at a siblings wedding.

But to add to the discussion, as a child of self employed people I distinctly remember this principle: \n\n\"Work for full price or free - never for cheap\"\n\n, because working for cheap devalues your work in the eyes of others, and gives them the idea they can haggle down even further- just a lot of hassle [clearly I come from a non-haggling culture, so limited applicability]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
