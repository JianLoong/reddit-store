I think that\u2019s a fair trade. You do photos for free and he does remodeling for free.", "NTA\n\nFor some reason, the idea of \u201cthis job is literally my livelihood\u201d goes over peoples\u2019 heads when it\u2019s their friends and family.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s just taking pictures!\u201d Doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s your full time job. Not to mention the steps such as editing that they conveniently seem to forget about.\n\n\u201cBut you love your job!\u201d Doesn\u2019t matter. Still a job, still need to be paid.\n\nI\u2019m a behavioral therapist. Should I give my clients free sessions because I love my job and you could sum it up to me talking with kids? Nope. Still a job, even if I love it and no matter how simply you view the work. (It\u2019s not simple, therapy or photography; people just like to be willfully ignorant.)", "NTA\n\nWhy would you need to get them a gift and gift them the wedding photos? Your brother sounds demanding.\n\nI would probably skip the games and not even bring the camera for the wedding.", "NTA\n\nSmart thing to charge, otherwise folks will take your effort for granted. As for making an exception for siblings, that depends entirely on the relationship.\n\nI'm assuming you brothers aren't very close and that he wouldn't go out of his way to make your day special.\n\nBut the fiancee expecting a registry gift on top is plain greedy.", "NTA. Your brother and future sister-in-law are assholes for expecting free professional work just because you are family. Let him pay someone else full price or get some kid with an iPhone to take the pictures. I hope you have a great time at the wedding.", "What an excellent personal analogy! \nWell articulated, pointed, not rude.\n\nI love when that happens.\n\nNTA obviously.", "NTA.   \n\n\nFamily and friends demanding free services from people who have their own businesses is so wild to me.   \n\n\nEven wilder that *he* called *you* \"cheap\" when he is the one trying to get hours and hours of free labor from you, when you already offered it at a steep discount from your standard rates.", "You were nice to buy this entitled moron anything at all quite frankly. NTA, props for not letting people take advantage of you. The number of people who still think photography is simply low-effort camera holding is staggering.", "NTA. Haha, well played.", "NTA. Your lament sounds like so many when a family member has a profession related to weddings.  Baker, stylists, clothes makers, etc  are always expected to donate their time and talent.  \n\nYou bought them a gift like any other guest.  Stop discussing it and enjoy yourself.  \n\nI have similar experiences when touring internationally.  I bring a ton of heavy bulky equipment and everyone else brings their cell phones.  They all give me their email addresses and what\u2019s app link so I can send them the best photos.", "The entitlement with weddings is so insane to me. Congrats, you\u2019re getting hitched. What more do you want from me??? NTA obviously.", "NTA, and as a hairstylist who is always expected to offer to do hair for every female in the wedding for free, I so understand, and I respect and admire your level of petty! \n\n Well played sir! Well played.", "NTA  he wants you to work for free and fianc\u00e9e \u201cexpected\u201d you to buy a gift off the registry. You\u2019re better than me, I would have laughed in his face and walked out. What entitled and greedy people. People love to pretend that photographers don\u2019t put in hours of real work during and after an event.", "> I said the price was my wedding gift. He said that his fiancee also expected me to get them a gift off the registry.  \n>  \n>**He said I'm being an asshole and cheap**\n\nSounds like the other way around. Entitled brother is not entitled to you working for free at his wedding. NTA, bro is.", "NTA that's like giving away free blowjobs smh.", "NTA.  I'm always amazed when family act as if they are entitled to professional services for free. You're providing a family discount.  That is more than enough of a wedding gift.\n\nBut takes the cake in this case is that they wanted a gift from the registry in addition to free services.\n\nSo, to summarize: you get to work for free rather than to enjoy the ceremony and the party,  as well as to give a gift as the price of admission.  Explain to me: why are you going?", "NTA   \n\n\nUnless he fixes everyone's house for free, why on earth should you do your professional job for free?    \n\n\nPeople have no idea how many hours and how much skill is needed for post processing.  They just think you spent an hour or so taking the photos.  They would probably underestimate the cost of the equipment by many magnitudes and if they knew wouldn't understand why you need more than one lens.", "NTA\n\nI don't know what it is about photographers, but people often seem to think that you owe them your labor for free - and as you point out, these people don't have the same expectations of a plumber or electrician. Presumably at some level, they don't think of being a photographer as actual work.\n\nYour work has value. You offered them a steep discount on your normal rates as a gift. They chose not to accept.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't hire my sister to work my wedding. I'd want her to be present as a guest, and celebrating as a guest, and being in the photos, and not behind the camera. Although I'd certainly be asking my photographer sister for recommendations.\n\nBut your brother clearly doesn't value your work at all.", "NTA. I like the comparison to your bathroom. People have no idea how hard it is being a photographer they think you just stand and snap a few pictures and your done but they don\u2019t get it", "Chef's kiss for \"I told him that I needed my bathroom remodel done and I wanted done at cost of materials since he is a contractor and it will cost him nothing in labor if he does all the work himself.\" NTA", "NTA - This always happens when people gte married and just expect their friends and family to supply labor for free.", "NTA - good for you.", "NTA.  Whole bunch of entitlement from the wedding couple.", "NTA - who wants to work at a siblings wedding. The analogy with the remodeling was really good.", "NTA, you want to be there as a guest, not the hired help.  As someone who's hobby is photography, if bride/groom start to hint about my hobby before the invites get mailed I RSVP as strong NO.  If they say after I have RSVPed yes, I end up with a conflict and let the bride and groom I will not be able to attend.", "Mh... NTA - you do you. But to add to the discussion, as a child of self employed people I distinctly remember this principle: \n\n\"Work for full price or free - never for cheap\"\n\n, because working for cheap devalues your work in the eyes of others, and gives them the idea they can haggle down even further- just a lot of hassle [clearly I come from a non-haggling culture, so limited applicability]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As a photographer, you charge what you do for your time and skill, with time being the finite resource. By your logic, offering a discount for your time to friends is considered a gift.\n\nHowever, you have stated that you are going to his wedding as family, and would probably bring your camera anyway. If getting paid for your time is your greatest concern, then wouldn\u2019t you be better off missing the wedding and photographing some factories? I mean, there isn\u2019t any money to be made as a guest at a wedding. \n\nSo, either way you will  1. Be at the wedding and 2. Probably have (and be using) your camera.

It's a pretty good one.", "Much agreed, siblings in a good relationship absolutely help one another! Seems like a fair trade give or take accordingly (time to do both types of job, raw materials, time not spent on paying works etc). This shouldn\u2019t even be wedding related.

Attending the wedding as a guest and taking pictures for fun is a break from what they do daily, but taking professional pictures is a task that will prevent them from enjoying the festivities. Ergo, it is a job and thus they should be paid.\n\nTell me, if OP was a surgeon and their sibling needed a life-saving surgery but couldn\u2019t afford it - would you expect OP to do it for free? No? Why? The answer to that is the same logic that applies here.", "Its so nice to hear about people being reasonable adults and things working out", "A brother isn\u2019t \u2018people\u2019.

I usually charge around $20 per hour for my time, and my results speak for themselves. My brother recently retired, and I had a 3D resin miniature printed and painted it for him FOR FREE. Based on the time it took me and the cost of the mini, I \u2018lost\u2019 around $1200. I did it without a second thought, because he\u2019s my freakin\u2019 brother.", "I consider the gift ancillary to the meat of the problem.

It would be time well-spent with your brother. You are essentially spending time together in both instances, the only difference is skill.\n\nListen, it looks like you and I simply have different views on the value of close family. You can charge whomever you want as much as you want. In my case, I use the rubric of \u2018what\u2019s more valuable to me: money or my brother\u2019s good will?\u2019 I\u2019ll pick good will 100% of the time, because choosing money would make me an AH."]}
