If that isn't good enough, here is a link to the topic on the irs website: [IRS link](https://www.eitc.irs.gov/tax-preparer-toolkit/frequently-asked-questions/divorced-and-separated-parents/divorced-and#:~:text=If%20parents%20are%20divorced%20and,if%20the%20requirements%20are%20met.)", "The tax credit is intended to assist with costs related to a child's needs. By claiming the money when he's not the one paying for the child's needs, he's taking what he hasn't earned out of the hands of the person who IS paying for those needs.", "The tax credit is intended to offset the costs of raising kids, no, whether through a refund or a reduction in tax liability? He claimed it, despite not being entitled to it, and as a result OP (who has primary custody and thus bears nearly all the costs) didn't get the tax credit she was entitled to for the children. That has now been taken away from him, and reassigned to OP.", "Im sure OP didn\u2019t tell us all the details and we only know her side of the story. But that\u2019s all we can judge, right? Based on what she said (without extra details), she is the one taking care of two kids 90% of the time while working full time. Meaning that the kids are in daycare/after school, which cost money (you should know this as you have two of your own). Unless there is a family member who is watching them (but that could also require a compensation of some sort). The income of both sides is irrelevant at this point as the court decides how much CS her husband has to pay. If he was laid off/fired, he could go back to court to \u201cre-adjust\u201d CS. it\u2019s still not an excuse to be $6k! behind in CS. She was not complaining (based on her post) about it until he claimed the child credit (I think, that is related to the child/minor credit that gov was giving to everyone, but that\u2019s just the speculation). We\u2019ll never find out unless OP provides details.\n\nAnyway, I was trying to explain my point that the OP is an NTA based on the info provided. And, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you in any way. Simply disagreeing with you determination:)", "\"...for as long as child support payments are current\"", "I don\u2019t understand what you aren\u2019t understanding. They had an agreement in place that he can claim one child if he pays child support. He did not pay child support, she reminded him of this agreement, and he claimed the child anyway. They already came to this agreement and he was caring for the child 13% percent of the time and not paying child support.", "The automation learned that you had programmed it to betray its robot brethren and it's revolting.  Lol.", "The majority of custody cases where they decide by negotiation and not a judge, yes the kids end up with the Mom. But that is not someone losing their kid, that is someone giving their kid away. Sometimes based on bad information or fear, but still they agree to let someone else take their kid either all the time or the majority of the time. \n\nYes, sometimes people have to fight to have their kids. That might be in court, that might be in a hospital, it might be through therapy. But when you sign up to be a parent you need to spend time, energy, and money to see them and that is true during divorce.", "I mean strictly based on what is written, I agree. I just have a gut feeling that there is more.\n\n\nAnd look, reasonable minds can disagree on Reddit.", "The problem is that this was part of the parenting plan approved by the courts. Hey, I have zero problem with going through the courts to change the plan to make up for the lack of child support, but by diverging from the parenting plan she puts herself at risk. As the OP states it, she is still allowing the court to garnish his wages and keep a running tab on arrears, but she is collecting several thousand in additional funds by diverting from the plan, which carries the weight of a court order.", "I was thinking of the custodial parent", "She\u2019s not diverting from the plan. The agreement is that he can claim if he\u2019s paying child support. This is what happens when he does not pay child support. And she\u2019s not adding to her funds, she is taking care of her child\u2019s needs 87% of the time without financial support. That\u2019s coming out of HER pocket. He isn\u2019t paying for anything, so he doesn\u2019t need to claim them.", "Apologies!  I'm pissed off with this deadbeat dad.", "She is garnishing his paycheck. He is (unwillingly) paying. And the plan states that he can claim one child as a dependent. There is no court in this country that would include language to trigger extra penalties if one party is behind. \nWhile it may be factual to say \"if the husband fails to pay CS the OP can claim both children on taxes\", the proper way is to go to court and adjust the plan to make that happen. Now the husband may be an idiot and never take this issue to court or find a copy of the parenting plan to show the IRS (at which point it bounces back to the OP). But at the risk of him growing a few extra brain cells the OP could be risking trouble from the IRS and family court if she doesn't do it right.", "Boohoo, a man has to pay what he agreed to pay. What a tragedy. She isn\u2019t garnishing his wages, btw, the state is. She can\u2019t just go to his work\u2019s payroll department and ask them to do that. His wages are being garnished because he didn\u2019t pay willingly when there was an agreement for him to pay. Considering she submitted the claim with the documentation to support that he had no right to claim a child on his taxes, she\u2019s not in any trouble with the IRS or family court."]}
