You just file your valid claim.  There will be delays as they look into the validity of each claim.  But they will make that determination.

With the exception, of course, of form 8332 to release the claim of dependency specifically, which does not entitle the other parent to certain other credits and benefits, and which the custodial parent is not generally obligated to provide.\n\nIf there's a dispute (competing claims on returns) they will investigate and make a determination based on the rules set forth for them in the law.", "He only became current with support after having his wages garnished and a payment plan forced upon him.

The same thing will happen again next year if he doesn\u2019t catch up!!! So if he doesn\u2019t pay her the $6000 he misses out on that deduction every year until he does. Karma is a bitch, and she\u2019ll keep bitch slapping him until he pays up. It\u2019s a beautiful thing lol", "Rather unfortunately this is dependent on location. Once the child passes the age in some places it's just gone.", "I did but, in his mind, I didn't have to.
