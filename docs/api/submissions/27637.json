If you have the valid claim (and it sounds like you do - certainly the IRS seems to agree so) then you file for it.  That's all you have to do.  You don't actually have to \"report\" anything.  You just file your valid claim.  There will be delays as they look into the validity of each claim.  But they will make that determination.  If that means someone is found to owe, well, that was *their* decision (or error, who counts as a dependent for whom and for which purposes can get complicated).\n\nBTW, to his point that you make more and so don't \"need\" the money, not only are you the parent with more nights of physical custody, but one of the tie-breaker rules actually breaks in favor of the *higher* earning parent.\n\nThe IRS doesn't much care about agreements, btw - often including things set forth in divorce decrees.  With the exception, of course, of form 8332 to release the claim of dependency specifically, which does not entitle the other parent to certain other credits and benefits, and which the custodial parent is not generally obligated to provide.\n\nIf there's a dispute (competing claims on returns) they will investigate and make a determination based on the rules set forth for them in the law.", "He only became current with support after having his wages garnished and a payment plan forced upon him.
