Like, don't give them if you have so many expectations about the recipient..kinda voids the gift.", "NTA. Even if it wasn't a comfort issue, it was a gift. That means MIL loses control of what happens to it, once she's gifted it.\n\nEveryone knows giving clothes as a gift is hit-and-miss, if you aren't 100% sure that's what the person wants. So if I gave clothes (even expensive ones), I'd just be relieved to see the person making use of them. It would confirm they liked them enough, to alter them so they could be used. It's not like she found the jeans in the trash.  \n\nWhat possible (realistic) ulterior motive could you have, to turn the jeans into shorts (other than the reason you gave)? A (reasonable) person would see you were trying to use them in a way your daughter could enjoy. Frankly, she sounds a control freak. If she's got any sense, she'll learn from this - and put more thought into suitability, if she wants to gift clothes.", "(NTA) for turning your daughter's designer jeans into shorts. You did so to ensure that she could actually wear and enjoy them, given her specific needs with AFOs.\n\nIt's understandable that your mother-in-law may have been upset about the alteration, considering the expense and the fact that she intended them to be jeans. However, it seems that you made a practical decision based on your daughter's comfort and ability to wear the clothing item.\n\nAdditionally, your mother-in-law's reaction and her history of giving gifts that don't quite fit or ignoring your requests for receipts suggest a lack of consideration for your daughter's needs and your preferences. You made the best decision for your daughter, and it's unfortunate that your mother-in-law is not understanding or supportive of your actions.\n\nIn the end, it's important to prioritize your daughter's comfort and well-being over preserving an expensive gift. You acted in her best interest, and that is what matters most.", "NTA. Mom of afo wearing toe walker here. Can't even believe a grandma would question your decision. She knows how hard this whole thing is.", "NTA. Grandma needs to get a fucking grip. I can\u2019t see that you did anything wrong, grandma sounds uncaring and apathetic.", "NTA. Unthoughtful gifting is one of my biggest pet peeves. My mom does this. \n\nI donated this horribly itchy pink sequin jacket she gave my daughter that she absolutely hated the texture of/wouldn't wear it and my mom had a similar fit..\n\nSometimes clothes just don't work out. \nAlso buying designer clothes for children is just.. silly.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nMil sounds ... Difficult", "NTA and calvin Klein isn't even designer you can buy them at Ross", "NTA\n\nHonestly MIL sounds like an absolute delight to have in the family. I can't imagine being upset that someone needs to return something that is too small, or turning a pair of jeans into shorts, because your grandchild can't wear them as pants with her medical aids. \n\nI have to say though that your husband is also TA for not backing you up, and suggesting that you should have just let the pants go to waste.", "NTA. it\u2019s a gift, in the first place, so she has no say on what you do with it. second, is she really that self centered that she doesn\u2019t know how her granddaughter\u2019s condition affects her clothing choices? shame on her, you\u2019re a great parent", "NAH. You have a right to do what you want with the gift. That is a definition of the gift. As long as MIL is not making it is a bigger deal out of it than what you have described, I do not see how she is an A either.  This is a reasonable conversation between two adults about an issue...", "NTA.  I would have done the same thing given your MIL's pattern of behavior.  Plus, once a gift is given, it's up to your daughter what to do with it.  As long as she was OK with shorts, that's the end of it.", "YTA, if your MIL eventually gave you the receipt for the dress, you can\u2019t use that as an excuse for not telling her about the jeans. To make it short and quick, no grandparent can buy your daughter clothes anymore. That way no one is treated differently from the other grandparents, and there will be no more events like these. But I do think you owe your MIL an apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Like it\u2019s not something for you to enjoy, but something they put in your house that they get to have control over. I have some people like this in my family.

The other grandparents have done nothing", "This tracks - our local Costco has Calvin Klein, Nautica, Tommy Hilfiger, etc., but it's all the mass produced stuff rather than the runway stuff.
