But my guess is just after all this time (i guess you are not married since yesterday?) It is starting to grind on him, and this to a point where he is not able to keep it in check anymore. So it comes out in a bad way. This is human and can happen.\n\nI think you have to think this over: what will happen when and if you have children? When you are 82 and have your own set of health issues, will you be able to take care of your brother anymore? Will you not go on vacations, not have kids (or have them raised by someone else), not have a dog or cat, not have a garden, not have a career or hobbies because you have to take care of your brother? Will you divorce and stay single forever if necessary? Your husband might (!) be thinking more and more about both your future and become frustrated. \n\nI think that parents with disabled kids should not push the responsibility to their siblings but prepare for a good solution after their passing. They apparently did not do that, and my guess is that this impedes your marriage going somewhere. You being full time caretaker of your brother can lead to you not having a life, but always being the caretaker for him till the day you die, with every other responsibility or wish coming second. \n\nSo when things have calmed a bit, maybe look intp assistance for your brother? Part-time, a good (!!!) Facility, whatever, there are options. Yoz do not need to go from \"i am 100% his caretaker\" to \"i do not care for him anymore\".", "It\u2019s great that you love and care for your brother but I don\u2019t blame your husband for being upset. You told him he will always be #2, but maybe he wants to be #1 once in a while. What happens if you have children? Are you going to sacrifice your entire life for your brother?", "Ergh, yes and no. \n\nYour brother is a priority, but considering your husband \u201csecond\u201d sounds so unhealthy. Spouses should come first. We leave the nest, start our own families, and your marriage started a new family. That should be at the top of your numbered list. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t maintain your position on having your brother live with you permanently, but is there no way to try and make your husband happy too? I don\u2019t know, it just sounds like you don\u2019t care to. HOWEVER, despite the fact that you tell him he\u2019s second to your brother, he should not have said any of those rude comments about you or your brother.", "ESH\n\nYour husband shouldn't have marry you knowing this and vice versa, also your brother is funtional enough to be working outside the house but can't even try independence?\n\nDo ever plan to have children? If so what priorities will shift? \n\nYour marriage seems to be at an impase, your husband have AH reaction at the situation but this seems like a \"last straw\" moment", "You shouldn't have got married. You should also never get married. You are not marriable. I'm loathe to say NAH or ESH cos your husband should not have called your brother the r-word and doing so is really bad.", "Why did you get married if you can\u2019t prioritise your husband and your marriage? You can care for your brother without making your husband feel like he doesn\u2019t matter.", "So your brother can work independently but not live independently? \nWhat will happen if you pass before him? Or get sick? Di you never go on holiday? Do you see children in your future? \nBut most importantly does your brother really need you or how you created an unnecessary co dependency that actually hampers his chance at independence?", "Your husband is definitely an AH for his comments relying his colleague you being a \"poor excuse for a woman\".\n\nBut I think on a whole, this is a bit NAH. \n\nHe definitely did marry you knowing that your brother's needs would be a priority but it likely is hard feeling second class in your own home all the time and its not unreasonable for him to maybe want to discuss your brother living elsewhere. \n\nBut at the same time, you were clear your brother is your number 1. That's a really hard bullet for anyone to bite in a relationship and it sounds like you've really tried to make that clear at every turn. \n\nIt kind of reminds me of the woman in Love Actually who is caring for her brother.", "As a now ex girl friend to a man that had two kids\u2026I came after the kids, after his job, after his baby momma\u2026..and thats a hard pill to swallow - especially when he stated that I was the last priority so matter of factly -as if I should be totally fine with never mattering or never being considered. I dumped his ass. What\u2019s the point of being in a relationship if it\u2019s only for me to be there for him as a support system but I get zero effort, support or concern.\n\nI think there is a kinder way of framing your husbands position or level of priority. He is in fact YOUR partner. You chose him for a reason and presumably it wasnt for you to treat him like a convenience or someone just present to pay half your bills and keep you company when you had free time. He also needs love. \n\nThe bottom line is no matter what the extenuating priorities or circumstances are you will make time for the people that you love and that truly matter to you.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t really love your husband, or he doesn\u2019t really matter to you, then divorce his ass so that he can go be a priority to someone that\u2019s going to give a shit about his feelings and treat him like he matters.", "ESH.  Neither one of you was right to enter into a marriage knowing that you weren\u2019t going to be fully committed. He lied to himself, or maybe was too naive to realize that he wouldn\u2019t be OK with it. And do you expect to come first to him when he doesn\u2019t come first to you? Imagine him expecting you to live with someone who you have to be decent to but they obviously don\u2019t care for you, and he makes it clear to you that they\u2019re more important than you. This is not a relationship of equals that you\u2019re describing.\n\nBetter figure out if you want to be divorced or if there\u2019s another source of support that can take some, not all but some of your brother\u2019s burden off of your marriage.", "ESH. You're right that you warned your husband that he'd never be your priority, but that's not a healthy way to conduct a marriage even if it's announced beforehand. \n\nAlso, as someone with a similarly situated sister, I wonder if you sacrificing your life (and you absolutely are if you can't maintain other relationships or start your own family) is best for you in the long run *or for your brother*. If he's holding down a job, is there a way for him to live at least semi-independently? He may want his own life, as well.", "ESH .. god people here. OP if you don't want to be divorced you should have a talk, were you both apologize.  \n\nBecause in the end reddits one sided opinion doesn't matter in the slightest. You were both out of line.", "After reading some other comments, and trying to be objective, I would say maybe N A H. \n\nYou're husband knew what he was getting into, but that doesn't mean he isn't human. It would be pretty hard knowing that you're basically second class in your own house and to your own wife. \n\nHere's the deal, he may be second to you, but /you/ are /first/ to him. That's likely why he puts up with it as much as he does. So to basically have you side against him all the time would likely be hard. \n\nDoes that mean your husband wasn't an asshole? No, he absolutely was. But we all snap in anger from time to time, no one is perfect, and he likely did not mean what he said. \n\nYour husband also should have communicated that he was bringing people home. \n\nThat said, your husband should also be allowed to bring people by from time to time to his own house without having to worry about everything imploding on him relationship wise. You said your brother was mostly normal, but just needed supervision. \n\nI wonder why he couldn't simply go to his own room. Also, he should have had his phone charged. I mean, he was home wasn't he? \n\nThe more I think about this, the more I kind of empathize with everyone in this situation.", "NAH, but in his position I\u2019d just leave. The idea of marrying someone and still always coming second, forever, isn\u2019t great. The only time I think that works is when a couple has kids and both parents agree that the kids come first, and it works because the priorities are the same.", "Why did you marry if you believe that your relationship to your brother will always be more important? YTA if you think your husband is in the wrong for having a few friends over in his own home even if that is not what your brother would want. Marriage counselling is the only answer I think.  Making one person your priority above others is literally how I see marriage.", "NTA, but WHY is your brother *your* responsibility? Just curious. \n\nAnd do you feel that this responsibility is going to allow you to lead any sort of a normal life with normal relationships?", "YTA\n\nYou did what you thought was best for your brother and were rude to your husband and his guests in the process. Your husband apparently settled for second-seat in your world, but he quite reasonably thought you'd find that you had some courtesy and respect, and maybe even love in your heart for him; his mistake. Not to worry, however, if you keep up the good work, you'll have no husband to worry about.", "YTA for getting married in the first place. This is not a marriage if your husband comes last.", "YTA", "I'm gonna say NAH. But please do him a favor and put divorce as an idea out there for you both. It might be healthy if you found other people. Your husband clearly doesn't like being 2nd to you when you're 1st to him. Which is normal.", "ESH (except the brother, he can't help that he is sick)\n\nYour husband sucks for being rude, mean and inviting people over without telling you. \n\nYou suck neglecting your husband (not in this occassion, but in general) and for telling him such an awful thing. \"You will always be second\". Who says that... if that's how you talked when you were dating, I have no idea why he ever married you. If you didn't talk like that before, you are horrible.\n\nThe coworker who made the comments is a total asshole.", "ESH. Your husband should not have used a slur for your brother. However, you married your husband. You should find a way to compromise. Honestly, don\u2019t be upset if this ends in divorce", "Just curious, no judgement. Why did YOU marry your husband? What role do you see him playing in your life? How did you see your marriage?", "ESH except your brother. Hubby was an AH for bringing people over without notice, and for what the said about your brother. You, well-meaning as you may have been, are an AH for telling your husband he\u2019s not your number one priority. If he doesn\u2019t already resent you and your brother, he will soon. Family counseling may be a good idea. Good luck.", "ESH. Your husband was the asshole in this moment, you are the asshole for the whole marriage. I feel sorry for your husband, he clearly made a mistake entering this relationship.", "NTA...like you said you explained things to him billion times so he knows of your situation from the start, and yet he still choose to marry you. u did your part of giving him a clear view of how things will be in the future it's his fault for not thinking things through and probably having some \"I can change her mind in the future\" \"things will change in a few year \" type of thoughts.\nAlso what's with people thinking once a woman get married her husband gotta be her priority number 1 and the only thing she has to worry about?? she love her brother and she want to care and be there for him what's wrong with that ??? \"do u really want to waste your life taking care of your brother\" like is family this  unimportant to you people??? \nAlso that comments his co-workers made ??? Instead of defending you in front of them he goes and start yelling at you?? so he just wanted u to welcome act like a maid and feeds those disgusting disrespectful guests or what ??", "This will be unpopular, however, YTA for getting married. He loves ( loved?) you but you made no attempt to accommodate him while he accomadated everything for you. You pulled away, he pulls away. I don't blame him. He may have been stupid for marrying you, and definitely an AH for dropping the R bomb. Hate to tell you, but, you're marriage has been over for sometime now. Either put your brother in an assisted living facility and actually BE a Wife or just leave him. Either way, stop punishing both your brother and your husband. You can't have both.", "Nta but you choosing your brother over and over again probably made him snap", "INFO are you and your husband planning on having children? \nJust how \"difficult\" will it be for your brother to live alone?", "NTA. You told your husband all the facts before you married him. Living with your brother may be proving too much for him now, some time in to the marriage. I get it that it is hard to share your home with someone who doesn't really like you. But your husband should be mature enough to be up front about it, pack his bags and go. He should not have to create a scene to bring things to a head before going.", "NTA\u2026..you\u2019re husband is. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re just roommates. Common courtesy is when you give someone a heads up people are coming over. He didn\u2019t even give you that common courtesy. I\u2019m sorry your husband didn\u2019t take you seriously when you said you\u2019d be caring for your brother for the rest of your life. Unless he knows a neuro-god, he\u2019s not just going to wake up and be better one day.", "Oof. I don\u2019t think you had any business getting married in the first place. No one in a marriage should ever feel like second best, it just doesn\u2019t work.", "NTA - you were upfront with your husband and he is changing the dialogue recently.  You need counseling, and possibly a divorce.", "NTA Your husbands coworker made sexist comments about you and you are to blame? You were honest from the start and this men simply didnt take you seriously?\n\nI swear.. all men have to offer today is the audacity.", "Even if your brother wasn't living with you, and your husband brought coworkers home without letting you know, your husband would be a AH. \n\nGiving each other a heads up about having guests in your house should be the norm. \n\nAnyways, NTA, as you were always straightforward with your husband about your priorities and he married you knowing that.", "I\u2019m going with NTA on this one incident, but understand that my opinion and that of everyone else on here doesn\u2019t matter. You have to decide do you love your husband?Do you want to stay married? Do you want children. Can you afford to live independently and support your brother? You\u2019re heading down a singular path. If it is where you want to go that\u2019s great, if not then you need to change course and that will mean making other arrangements. Right now your husband is actually coming to understand what you meant when you told him about your commitment to your brother. He has finally mapped out what it means for his future and from his distance and comments he doesn\u2019t like what he sees. Loads of people are saying he knew what he was taking on but did he? Before you got married did you discuss having children? Did you say that isn\u2019t on the table as my brother will always come first or did you say that was something you wanted without understanding the ramifications of what your stated commitment to your brother really means and that you would be giving mixed messages.", "NTA, you are essentially a caretaker for your brother and that\u2019s not a responsibility you can shrug off because your husband\u2019s throwing his toys out of the pram.

Reading the post and comments the detached nature OP uses to talk about their husband is worrying, but the husband should have communicated better. However I find myself wondering how many times he's tried to communicate previously, except OP is absolute on the subject so there's no wiggle room.\n\nI find myself thinking if husband was happy to assist with the brother but expected they'd have their own lives still. Whereas the reality is that what's meant to be his home is just a care facility for his brother in law, and he another member of staff. The way OP talks it seems like they've been raised to care for their brother, and nothing else exists beyond it. So no family, no kids, no life, and husband has hit his end. Carers fatigue is very real.\n\nHusband thought he'd found a wife and a new life, OP thought they'd found another member of care staff.", "My brother getting a job is him trying independence. He works in an environment with people he has known for years and trusts. Living alone is difficult for him because he has issues with impulse control and age regression.

In general, when they're underage at least. My husband comes after my kids and I come after the kids for him(most of the time-im primary parent so sometimes the best support is supporting me so I can support them). But absolutely crazy that it was expected for you to come after his mom(eww, mamas boy much?), his job(better not have any medical emergencies), and his baby mama(is he dating her or you? What if she doesn't like you? Does she call the shots?). Obviously, you're not with this person anymore but just my thoughts for that situation or any other situation similar for you or anyone else. Always behind the kids but always before anyone and everything else.", "I'm sorry for what you've experienced but it seems you're projecting a lot here. There is no evidence that OP treats his husband like you describe in general in life. She may have worded the priority thing in an unfortunate way, but you are assuming she never makes room for her husband and a lot of other things. I totally understand that it must be hard frustrating for him, and they need to find a better balance and understand if their lives are compatible or not, but from one episode that escalated you are projecting a whole relationship. I think his husband was not really at his best in that episode too, like what kind of dynamics does he have with his coworkers where if the wife has to suddenly handle an unexpected situation and doesn't show her biggest smile and welcomes them, they make comments about it, and her husband instead of providing context and telling their coworkers not to talk about his wife like that, just gets angry at her because she made him look like someone with a stupid wife? And then he proceeded insulting her brother like 12 years old bully. I think this episode escalated a lot and both have growing frustrations they have to address, but we can't know more than this honestly.", "One parent is deceased, the other is the cause of his problems.

I have a job, friends, hobbies. I don\u2019t have the most time, but that was pretty much expected.", "Because I love him. I know how corny it sounds. And he still wanted to marry me despite everything. He made me feel loveable. You can cringe, it\u2019s okay. Clearly we were quite naive.", "No children. \n\nModerately difficult. He has issues with impulse control and age regression.", "Yeah, if my husband brought coworkers home after work unannounced I'd be a little miffed as well.  There should always be a heads up - what if the house was a mess, what if I'd come down with the flu or food poisoning?\n\nNTA.", "I can live independently and support my brother on my own. My husband isn\u2019t involved in my brother\u2019s care. \n\nYes we really did have all these conversations. Why would I get married based on lies, mixed messages, and false hope?", "I don\u2019t believe he treats my brother poorly. My brother wouldn\u2019t be able to hide that. Trust me on this.", "The solution  to all relationship problems is NOT divorce.", "Good. I actually think he'll be happy not having to come in 2nd place in his marriage anymore in his own home.", "It all depends on how much \"my brother is my number one priority\" is going on.\nLike, I get it, op needs to take care of her brother, but he is apparently capable of holding down a job.\nSo if op is just \"he needs to stay here because he can't live on his own\", she is nta.\nIf she regularly drops everything just because her brother asks for something, she might be ta.\nThere is a fine line between \"I need to take care of my brother\" and \"I can't have a life of my own because I can't be away from my brother for 10 minutes\"", "ESH is also a good judgement i think :) i think the whole situation goes beyond the judging-categories in this sub since I think there are many factors to take into consideration. Maybe OP needs more structured advice than a simple judgement?", "I don't think there is malice in anyone here but there was lack of realizaton what your situation will be in the long run, being always the \"last person\" in your own home with time must be hard and would straing any relationship even more a marriage.", "Do you not see kids in your future because of your brother or because you don't want them? I'm not going to pass any judgement but like I said earlier,you need to prioritise yourself too. Your life matters too.", "I don't disagree, he completely crossed the line with utilizing a slur toward your brother. \n\nBut I think you're seeing it from a logical and practical view and he's likely experiencing this from an emotional place which is causing him to behave in this way (not that it's an excuse). \n\n> But I expect him to act like an adult and talk to me without insulting me or my brother. \n\nIs it possible he *has* tried talking to you about it and you've inadvertently shut down conversations? Like in the instance of discussing your brother's home situation, it sounds like this was his way of trying to broach what is clearly a sensitive conversation with you and it wasn't able to go anywhere. \n\nAgain, his behaviour isn't acceptable with his comments.", ">But I expect him to act like an adult and talk to me\n\nYou mean like how he called you but you just ignored his calls?", "I don't think it's fair to expect warnings just because he wants to bring someone into his own home though", "No, you\u2019re not fooling anyone into thinking you \u201chave a normal life with normal relationships\u201d. \n\nIn a marriage your spouse is #1, until kids maybe, not your brother. \n\nYour life, and it appears now your husbands life, revolves around caring for your adult brother. This is what you\u2019ve chosen and will be like this, presumably, until you die. \n\nThere is nothing \u201cnormal\u201d about your life or relationships. \n\nHonestly, it feels selfish that you even married your husband, knowing his life would be effected to this degree. He can\u2019t even bring friends over to his own home without upsetting you - you think thats normal?", "But saying your husband comes second is a great way to ruin a marriage. Isn't there any way you can look into alternative arrangements for your brother's care? You can't keep caring for him forever,at some point you have to prioritise yourself and your new family.", "I understand. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re a great person tbh. You were up front about everything going into the relationship, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. \n\nThe issue is that sometimes people agree to things that they think they can handle but when faced with the reality of it they find out that they can\u2019t handle it. That might be what\u2019s happening with your husband. \n\nI hope everything works out.", ">He has no one else but me.\n\n\nThat's a problem. Are you providing him with social outlets? Have you discussed whether he might like to live more independently?", "Then it is time for a really difficult conversation. I wish you all the best.", "lol.. you mentioned brother \u201cdoesn\u2019t really care for\u201d your husband despite husband\u2019s years of nothing but kindness towards brother\u2026 if you think this was him \u201csnapping\u201d and you still prioritized brother\u2019s anxiety over husband\u2019s FIRST time clearly and candidly expressing negative feelings towards the situation? that man\u2019s gonna leave you and I don\u2019t think you care much. I just hope you don\u2019t waste too much more of his time.", "No, but the solution to your husband resenting you caring for your brother, calling him a slur and not defending you from his sexist coworkers before going and crying to his fucking mum like a baby, very well might be; that's way too many red flags and they all happened in *one evening*, I'd be kicking him straight the fuck out.", "Mostly because of my brother but that\u2019s just me. My husband doesn\u2019t ever want kids. I know my life matters, I\u2019m not unhappy. I appreciate you saying this though.", "Maybe you could ask your brother to treat husband with more kindness since you said your brother doesn\u2019t care for your husband much.", "My brother having a panic attack in the middle of the street is more important to me than him yelling at me for not serving him and his coworkers dinner.", "Wanting a warning before bringing people over is *always* fair. Even if the brother didn\u2019t exist just showing up with coworkers in tow would be an AH thing to spring on your wife.", "It is fair when he wants me to feed all of them and entertain them all night.", "Well I do have a normal life. Sure, caring for my adult brother makes me a little more different than other people but I have a job, I have friends, I have more happy days than sad days, I do fun things alone and with other people. Caring for my brother doesn\u2019t mean I stay home in a corner doing nothing unless my brother asks for something. \n\nAlso I rejected my husband way before we even started dating. For this exact reason. I\u2019m not holding my husband back by any means either. I always told him that he could leave if it gets too much for him. And if he wanted me to make dinner for him and his coworkers, a warning would\u2019ve been nice. I wouldn\u2019t have said no either. I would\u2019ve been upset even if my brother wasn\u2019t involved.", "I know many people who are doing the same things I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s not that great. But I appreciate the compliment, feels nice to hear one every once in a while. \n\nYeah maybe. I know I sound like I couldn\u2019t care less, but I hope something works out as well, in a way that\u2019ll make everyone happy.", "He has a whole group of friends he hangs out with regularly. He works with his best friend and his family too. I\u2019m not the only person he interacts with. Being around strangers is hard for him, but that is normal.\n\nNo we have not discussed it with him. I have my reasons and the professionals we work with all agree that my brother is not ready for this conversation. He cannot make the difference between \u201cdo you want to try living on your own\u201d vs \u201cI\u2019m tired of you, get out of my life.\u201d Especially coming from me. I think his therapist has brought it up though.", "My brother doesn\u2019t really care for me either. Maybe he does and he just doesn\u2019t know how to show it. Either way, it\u2019s just how it is. \n\nYes, I still prioritized my brother\u2019s anxiety over my husband\u2019s discomfort. My husband is mentally well enough to not do anything unpredictable, my brother is the opposite.", "The husband knew exactly what he was signing up for. The husband is yet another male who thinks that marriage or a baby will suddenly change their wife\u2019s mind and force them to submit to the husbands wants \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22 if anything he\u2019s literally the one to waste HER time \ud83d\ude02", "How much work do you have caring for your brother? How does it look like? And how does the life of your brother look like?", "Just dont do that, rather than expecting warning.", "Did he or did he just want one normal night with his wife and coworkers where he wasn't having to walk on eggshells for someone who by your own statement is not nice to him. \n\nDo him a favor and get divorced.", "You cannot just hope everything works out magically, you have to make it happen. You need to sit down and have a completely open conversation with your husband. Yes your brother is the main priority in the sense of if he was your child, but your husband should also be a priority, just in a different way. You need to let him air out everything he is feeling in a healthy way and work on your relationship.", "Sure, I mean parents do what you\u2019re doing. But as a parent, I signed up for that. This situation wasn\u2019t of your own making or your choice but you\u2019re still prioritizing your brother. I think that deserves recognition \u2764\ufe0f", "If your husband realised he will always be second there is a good chance he will look for someone who would put him first\u2026I feel your struggle but if you knew that you could never give a husband 100% of the love, dedication and attention it takes to make a marriage work then it might be just not get married\u2026boyfriend and girlfriend could work in this situation but I don\u2019t thing a marriage could I think neither is the The AH but you need to have a hard conversation about what to do moving forward", "It\u2019s different every day. The first few years was making sure he doesn\u2019t make any drastic decisions and takes his meds. Recently, it\u2019s helping him learn how to live in the real world. Lots of routines and making sure he sticks to them. Being present when he has any episodes, before and after. Making him feel loved and appreciated.", "How much time does that consume? And how much energy does that consume?\n\nYou are not a bad person. But from your post and what you are describing, I fear that your whole life and marriage might just be consumed by your brother? \nDo you see yourself doing still all this intensive care when you are 40? Amd do you yourself see doing that when you are 40 while potentially having nothing else going om in your life?", "Well the first few years took all my time and energy but my husband wasn\u2019t my husband or boyfriend then. Now it\u2019s just quick reminders and words of encouragement throughout the day. When he first started his job, I had to wait for him till he got home but now I no longer have to do that. \n\nI don\u2019t see me doing this at 40. If I\u2019m 40, my brother will be 37. While I still plan on being actively involved in his life, I think he\u2019ll be able to live independently by then.\n\nBy the way, I don\u2019t think anyone is saying I\u2019m a bad person, I understand all the comments I\u2019m getting are from a place of concern."]}
