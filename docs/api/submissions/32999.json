When he was old enough, he became my responsibility. He seems just like everyone else but he needs supervision and it would be very difficult for him to live alone. \n\nMy husband knew this when we started dating. I have told him a billion times my brother will always be my priority. He understood. My husband and brother\u2019s relationship has been decent. My brother doesn\u2019t care for him much and my husband treated him kindly. Like I said, he was quite understanding. \n\nThings started to change a couple months ago. He\u2019s not mean, but he\u2019s become distant. I asked him if everything was alright and he asked me if my brother would ever move out. I told him the truth, most likely no. Of course we don\u2019t know what the future may hold but my brother still needs me at this moment in time. My husband didn\u2019t push it.\n\nThe other day my husband came home with a few of his coworkers. I was given no warning. I tried calling my brother so he wouldn\u2019t be overwhelmed when he came home from his job but his phone was dead. So when he did come home, he was extremely overwhelmed and I had to take him on a walk. My husband called me several times while we were out on this walk but I didn\u2019t answer. Honestly I was a little annoyed but mostly I was busy with my brother. \n\nWe went home eventually and his coworkers had left thankfully. I was just going to let it go but my husband yelled at me for embarrassing him in front of his coworkers. I asked him what he meant by that and he explained that I had a bad attitude with everyone and was very inhospitable. He said I didn\u2019t act like his wife and one of his coworkers made fun of my husband for marrying a poor excuse of a woman. Edit: by this he meant cook for them and entertain them. Keep in mind, had he given me a warning, I would\u2019ve done so with no complaints. But was I supposed to read his mind? \n\nI told him to snap out of it and he should know better. My husband rolled his eyes and told me that I only have my brother in my head and that he\u2019s just a second thought. He then called my brother the r slur. \n\nThis made me extremely angry so I told him that there\u2019s no use getting mad at me, he married me knowing that he\u2019ll always be second. He called me insufferable before leaving. Now he\u2019s with his mom now and she yelled at me for coddling my brother and neglecting my husband. I\u2019m curious and need to let off steam, AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nJust in case anyone gets the wrong idea, my husband isn\u2019t involved in my brother\u2019s care, like at all. Not even financially. I wouldn\u2019t put that burden on him. He did go to a few therapy sessions just to understand my brother\u2019s disability but that\u2019s it.

But my guess is just after all this time (i guess you are not married since yesterday?) It is starting to grind on him, and this to a point where he is not able to keep it in check anymore. So it comes out in a bad way. This is human and can happen.\n\nI think you have to think this over: what will happen when and if you have children? When you are 82 and have your own set of health issues, will you be able to take care of your brother anymore? Will you not go on vacations, not have kids (or have them raised by someone else), not have a dog or cat, not have a garden, not have a career or hobbies because you have to take care of your brother? Will you divorce and stay single forever if necessary? Your husband might (!) be thinking more and more about both your future and become frustrated. \n\nI think that parents with disabled kids should not push the responsibility to their siblings but prepare for a good solution after their passing. They apparently did not do that, and my guess is that this impedes your marriage going somewhere. You being full time caretaker of your brother can lead to you not having a life, but always being the caretaker for him till the day you die, with every other responsibility or wish coming second. \n\nSo when things have calmed a bit, maybe look intp assistance for your brother? Part-time, a good (!!!) Facility, whatever, there are options. Yoz do not need to go from \"i am 100% his caretaker\" to \"i do not care for him anymore\".", "It\u2019s great that you love and care for your brother but I don\u2019t blame your husband for being upset. You told him he will always be #2, but maybe he wants to be #1 once in a while. What happens if you have children? Are you going to sacrifice your entire life for your brother?", "Ergh, yes and no. \n\nYour brother is a priority, but considering your husband \u201csecond\u201d sounds so unhealthy. Spouses should come first. We leave the nest, start our own families, and your marriage started a new family. That should be at the top of your numbered list. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t maintain your position on having your brother live with you permanently, but is there no way to try and make your husband happy too? I don\u2019t know, it just sounds like you don\u2019t care to. HOWEVER, despite the fact that you tell him he\u2019s second to your brother, he should not have said any of those rude comments about you or your brother.", "ESH\n\nYour husband shouldn't have marry you knowing this and vice versa, also your brother is funtional enough to be working outside the house but can't even try independence?\n\nDo ever plan to have children? If so what priorities will shift? \n\nYour marriage seems to be at an impase, your husband have AH reaction at the situation but this seems like a \"last straw\" moment", "You shouldn't have got married. You should also never get married. You are not marriable. I'm loathe to say NAH or ESH cos your husband should not have called your brother the r-word and doing so is really bad.", "Why did you get married if you can\u2019t prioritise your husband and your marriage? You can care for your brother without making your husband feel like he doesn\u2019t matter.", "So your brother can work independently but not live independently? \nWhat will happen if you pass before him? Or get sick? Di you never go on holiday? Do you see children in your future? \nBut most importantly does your brother really need you or how you created an unnecessary co dependency that actually hampers his chance at independence?", "Your husband is definitely an AH for his comments relying his colleague you being a \"poor excuse for a woman\".\n\nBut I think on a whole, this is a bit NAH. \n\nHe definitely did marry you knowing that your brother's needs would be a priority but it likely is hard feeling second class in your own home all the time and its not unreasonable for him to maybe want to discuss your brother living elsewhere. \n\nBut at the same time, you were clear your brother is your number 1. That's a really hard bullet for anyone to bite in a relationship and it sounds like you've really tried to make that clear at every turn. \n\nIt kind of reminds me of the woman in Love Actually who is caring for her brother.", "As a now ex girl friend to a man that had two kids\u2026I came after the kids, after his job, after his baby momma\u2026..and thats a hard pill to swallow - especially when he stated that I was the last priority so matter of factly -as if I should be totally fine with never mattering or never being considered. I dumped his ass. What\u2019s the point of being in a relationship if it\u2019s only for me to be there for him as a support system but I get zero effort, support or concern.\n\nI think there is a kinder way of framing your husbands position or level of priority. He is in fact YOUR partner. You chose him for a reason and presumably it wasnt for you to treat him like a convenience or someone just present to pay half your bills and keep you company when you had free time. He also needs love. \n\nThe bottom line is no matter what the extenuating priorities or circumstances are you will make time for the people that you love and that truly matter to you.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t really love your husband, or he doesn\u2019t really matter to you, then divorce his ass so that he can go be a priority to someone that\u2019s going to give a shit about his feelings and treat him like he matters.", "ESH.  Neither one of you was right to enter into a marriage knowing that you weren\u2019t going to be fully committed. He lied to himself, or maybe was too naive to realize that he wouldn\u2019t be OK with it. And do you expect to come first to him when he doesn\u2019t come first to you? Imagine him expecting you to live with someone who you have to be decent to but they obviously don\u2019t care for you, and he makes it clear to you that they\u2019re more important than you. This is not a relationship of equals that you\u2019re describing.\n\nBetter figure out if you want to be divorced or if there\u2019s another source of support that can take some, not all but some of your brother\u2019s burden off of your marriage.", "ESH. You're right that you warned your husband that he'd never be your priority, but that's not a healthy way to conduct a marriage even if it's announced beforehand. \n\nAlso, as someone with a similarly situated sister, I wonder if you sacrificing your life (and you absolutely are if you can't maintain other relationships or start your own family) is best for you in the long run for you *or for your brother*. If he's holding down a job, is there a way for him to live at least semi-independently? He may want his own life, as well.", "ESH .. god people here. OP if you don't want to be divorced you should have a talk, were you both apologize.  \n\nBecause in the end reddits one sided opinion doesn't matter in the slightest. You were both out of line.", "After reading some other comments, and trying to be objective, I would say maybe N A H.\n\nYour husband knew what he was getting into, but that doesn't mean he isn't human. It would be pretty hard knowing that you're basically second class in your own house and to your own wife.\n\nHere's the deal, he may be second to you, but /you/ are /first/ to him. That's likely why he puts up with it as much as he does. So to basically have you side against him all the time would likely be hard.\n\nDoes that mean your husband wasn't an asshole? No, he absolutely was. But we all snap in anger from time to time, no one is perfect, and he likely did not mean what he said.\n\nYour husband also should have communicated that he was bringing people home.\n\nThat said, your husband should also be allowed to bring people by from time to time to his own house without having to worry about everything imploding on him relationship wise. You said your brother was mostly normal, but just needed supervision.\n\nI wonder why he couldn't simply go to his own room. Also, he should have had his phone charged. I mean, he was home wasn't he?\n\nThe more I think about this, the more I kind of empathize with everyone in this situation.", "NAH, but in his position I\u2019d just leave. The idea of marrying someone and still always coming second, forever, isn\u2019t great. The only time I think that works is when a couple has kids and both parents agree that the kids come first, and it works because the priorities are the same.", "Why did you marry if you believe that your relationship to your brother will always be more important? YTA if you think your husband is in the wrong for having a few friends over in his own home even if that is not what your brother would want. Marriage counselling is the only answer I think.  Making one person your priority above others is literally how I see marriage.", "NTA, but WHY is your brother *your* responsibility? Just curious. \n\nAnd do you feel that this responsibility is going to allow you to lead any sort of a normal life with normal relationships?", "YTA\n\nYou did what you thought was best for your brother and were rude to your husband and his guests in the process. Your husband apparently settled for second-seat in your world, but he quite reasonably thought you'd find that you had some courtesy and respect, and maybe even love in your heart for him; his mistake. Not to worry, however, if you keep up the good work, you'll have no husband to worry about.", "YTA for getting married in the first place. This is not a marriage if your husband comes last.", "YTA", "I'm gonna say NAH. But please do him a favor and put divorce as an idea out there for you both. It might be healthy if you found other people. Your husband clearly doesn't like being 2nd to you when you're 1st to him. Which is normal.", "ESH (except the brother, he can't help that he is sick)\n\nYour husband sucks for being rude, mean and inviting people over without telling you.\n\nYou suck for neglecting your husband (not in this occassion, but in general) and for telling him such an awful thing. \"You will always be second\". Who says that... if that's how you talked when you were dating, I have no idea why he ever married you. If you didn't talk like that before, you are horrible.\n\nThe coworker who made the comments is a total asshole.", "ESH. Your husband should not have used a slur for your brother. However, you married your husband. You should find a way to compromise. Honestly, don\u2019t be upset if this ends in divorce", "Just curious, no judgement. Why did YOU marry your husband? What role do you see him playing in your life? How did you see your marriage?", "ESH except your brother. Hubby was an AH for bringing people over without notice, and for what the said about your brother. You, well-meaning as you may have been, are an AH for telling your husband he\u2019s not your number one priority. If he doesn\u2019t already resent you and your brother, he will soon. Family counseling may be a good idea. Good luck.", "ESH. Your husband was the asshole in this moment, you are the asshole for the whole marriage. I feel sorry for your husband, he clearly made a mistake entering this relationship.", "NTA...like you said you explained things to him billion times so he knows of your situation from the start, and yet he still choose to marry you. u did your part of giving him a clear view of how things will be in the future it's his fault for not thinking things through and probably having some \"I can change her mind in the future\" \"things will change in a few year \" type of thoughts.\nAlso what's with people thinking once a woman get married her husband gotta be her priority number 1 and the only thing she has to worry about?? she love her brother and she want to care and be there for him what's wrong with that ??? \"do u really want to waste your life taking care of your brother\" like is family this  unimportant to you people??? \nAlso that comments his co-workers made ???

He may have been stupid for marrying you, and definitely an AH for dropping the R bomb. Hate to tell you, but, you're marriage has been over for sometime now. Either put your brother in an assisted living facility and actually BE a Wife or just leave him. Either way, stop punishing both your brother and your husband. You can't have both.", "Nta but you choosing your brother over and over again probably made him snap", "INFO are you and your husband planning on having children? \nJust how \"difficult\" will it be for your brother to live alone?", "NTA. You told your husband all the facts before you married him. Living with your brother may be proving too much for him now, some time in to the marriage.

You have to decide do you love your husband?Do you want to stay married? Do you want children. Can you afford to live independently and support your brother? You\u2019re heading down a singular path. If it is where you want to go that\u2019s great, if not then you need to change course and that will mean making other arrangements. Right now your husband is actually coming to understand what you meant when you told him about your commitment to your brother. He has finally mapped out what it means for his future and from his distance and comments he doesn\u2019t like what he sees. Loads of people are saying he knew what he was taking on but did he? Before you got married did you discuss having children?

ESH.", "I think this is a good take, but admit I find myself veering to ESH (except the brother). Reading the post and comments the detached nature OP uses to talk about their husband is worrying, but the husband should have communicated better. However I find myself wondering how many times he's tried to communicate previously, except OP is absolute on the subject so there's no wiggle room.\n\nI find myself thinking if husband was happy to assist with the brother but expected they'd have their own lives still. Whereas the reality is that what's meant to be his home is just a care facility for his brother in law, and he another member of staff. The way OP talks it seems like they've been raised to care for their brother, and nothing else exists beyond it. So no family, no kids, no life, and husband has hit his end. Carers fatigue is very real.\n\nHusband thought he'd found a wife and a new life, OP thought they'd found another member of care staff.\n\nEdit: as I'm getting comments about the now spelled out poor behaviour of the husband, OP has rewritten a chunk of their post, as well as adding in several edits. I find it suspicious this was done after judgements started coming in, especially given all the information is directly relevant to the situation they sought judgement on. This isn't to say it didn't occur as OP has now written, but it erodes reliability of OP as a narrator.", "My brother getting a job is him trying independence. He works in an environment with people he has known for years and trusts. Living alone is difficult for him because he has issues with impulse control and age regression. Though he seems completely normal, he has ended up in extremely complicated situations based on the fact that he cannot communicate properly and has trouble understanding certain things. \n\nNo we do not plan on having kids. I have known my husband for years before we started dating, he has never wanted kids. \n\nI can understand your judgement, thanks for sharing your perspective.", "This should be top comment. Do your husband a favour and get a divorce.", "THIS", "He works part time and has only been able to after years of therapy and hospitalizations.

In general, when they're underage at least. My husband comes after my kids and I come after the kids for him(most of the time-im primary parent so sometimes the best support is supporting me so I can support them). But absolutely crazy that it was expected for you to come after his mom(eww, mamas boy much?), his job(better not have any medical emergencies), and his baby mama(is he dating her or you? What if she doesn't like you? Does she call the shots?). Obviously, you're not with this person anymore but just my thoughts for that situation or any other situation similar for you or anyone else. Always behind the kids but always before anyone and everything else.", "I'm sorry for what you've experienced but it seems you're projecting a lot here. There is no evidence that OP treats his husband like you describe in general in life. She may have worded the priority thing in an unfortunate way, but you are assuming she never makes room for her husband and a lot of other things. I totally understand that it must be hard frustrating for him, and they need to find a better balance and understand if their lives are compatible or not, but from one episode that escalated you are projecting a whole relationship. I think his husband was not really at his best in that episode too, like what kind of dynamics does he have with his coworkers where if the wife has to suddenly handle an unexpected situation and doesn't show her biggest smile and welcomes them, they make comments about it, and her husband instead of providing context and telling their coworkers not to talk about his wife like that, just gets angry at her because she made him look like someone with a stupid wife?

With her it\u2019s a no go issue.  She has her own issues.  I understand she loves her brother and wants whats best for him, but there is no way on G-Ds green earth she will be able to handle him.  Her mother can barely handle him and is developing health issues because of it.\n\n  There are private group homes were adults with issues can live with each other.  They are staffed with medical professionals and are not nursing homes or institutions.  There are also private apartments for people who are able to live on their own.  They can even have CNAs or other assistants come in daily or round the clock to help out with certain tasks or just for companionship.  It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t options.  \n\nIt\u2019s almost like the sister is baby her brother and holding him back, which I have seen from many families with developmentally disabled children.  My brothers wife being one of them (not my nieces mother, her mother, thankfully try\u2019s to make her brother independent to some extent).  My oldest nephew was so coddled growing up that he can barely do anything on his own.  He\u2019s also insufferable to live with and allowed to behave in such a manner.  If he were low functioning I could see a reason for the coddling, but he\u2019s not, at all.  \n\nIt\u2019s not good to coddle anyone, because it can stunt their development and learning process.  Especially in people with disabilities.  Which can bring about problems later on in life.  Not just for the person who is disabled, but for their family members as well.  Eventually they become a burden and that\u2019s not right for anyone in the situation.  No one should live there lives like that, or be seen as a burden.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for the sister to figure out a new situation, as hard as it may be for her to do.  Make it seem like an exciting grand adventure for her brother so it doesn\u2019t upset his life too much and even seems fun for him.  If he\u2019s able to work he can probably live in an apartment on his own, which he\u2019d probably prefer.  There is plenty of disabled housing in every town and all you have to do is go to a DHS office to request in home assistance or even ask his SSD caseworker to suggest something.  There are plenty of options, though.  I think you can even go to Human Aide if you have it in your area and possibly United Way (don\u2019t quote me on the United Way though).  I think even HUD does something with housing and/or assistance.  You just have to check around with each city or town.

No he shouldn\u2019t have called her brother names.  That wasn\u2019t right.  Even if he was frustrated and at his lowest.  Unfortunately if she insists on keeping her brother with her this is the exact situation she will find herself in, time and again.  Plus what will she do if she does have children?

It seems that none. She constantly shows that she will prioritize her brother even if he is not on the right.

Has his own phone, etc. He arrives home and can't go to his room or something not to be overwhelmed? My question here is not whether this is possible is whether this was clear for OPs husband. Did he bring his coworkers knowing this would cause distress to the brother? OP doesn't say, which seems telling. For me, there hinges whether OPs husband is an ah or not. If he didn't expect all the drama that ensued and his wife was rude to his guest, and then she refused to answer his calls for a long while, they basically disappeared. His outburst is mostly a reaction to her treatment, which is basically the silent treatment. Now, if he knew or expected the brother to react badly, he was pocking the bee's nest on purpose, and he was an ah.\n\nIn any case, OPs attitude toward her husband is awful and needs to change. If this is to last, they need to work as a team and maybe in an effort not to burden her husband she is not playing as a team. She also needs to work in bridging the gap between her brother and her husband. It doesn't seem right to have the brother not liking the husband and living together.\n\nRight now, it is like the husband is a guest in his own house, and OP catters towards the brother no matter what.

He may have just wanted her to say hi, make conversation, etc. That's what a person would assume is a partners job when co-workers or friends come over. Sounds like OP is trying to make him sound as bad as possible, especially considering the edits made to her post.

I don't think any parent would get judged for putting their kids first, the only difference here is that the dependent OP is caring for is bigger and older than most dependents.", "No, it's really not. Sure was upfront about this from the beginning. Her disabled brother needs her, and it's 100% good and fine that he's her priority. That shouldn't mean that she forever has to be single, jesus christ, she just needs to be open and honest with partners which she has done.
