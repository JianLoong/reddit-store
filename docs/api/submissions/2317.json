But be ready for dad not to come because she's not welcome. Hopefully he can be mature and understand you're trying to avoid drama on your special day. And if not? At least you're getting ahead of it before the big day. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nTell your dad it's not because she's his partner or even AP that she's not invited, it's because she verbally abused your mom and you're not having her there because of that.  No matter how your dad feels about your mom, you still love her and want her to be comfortable at your wedding.", "NTA. You're on the right side of the scale of rudeness--while parents should have plus ones, no one should ever get a plus one whose verbally abused a family member. So, you can ban that woman, and no guilt required. \n\nIf you're feeling bold, you could even say he's welcome to bring another date, just in case he's acquired more APs.  But it sounds like you're reasonable, so just know that you're doing the right thing protecting your family here.", "NTA \n\nUnfortunately you might have to damage some relationships depending on how uncompromising your father is. Just to offer this perspective, your father has showed a lack of care to how he treats or makes other people feel, ergo your mother. So I wouldn\u2019t be entirely surprised if he was dismissive and inconsiderate of your feelings. Sorry you\u2019ve had to hit a potentially rough impasse.", "NTA\n\n\"I believe the blame of ruining a marriage is on the person in the marriage, not the AP\"\n\nAnd you can still avoid an AP even you would not have blame her.", "NTA.  Dad should be invited, but AP should be disinvited.   It should be stated on Dad's invitation that he comes to the wedding only if he comes alone.   Should he arrive with AP, they should both be required to leave.   Let's hope that you have some large friends that can escort him to the door should he resist.", "NTA. Tell him that given AP\u2019s behavior towards your mother, the wronged party, that she\u2019s not invited and you\u2019re not budging. So if he\u2019s willing to miss his daughters wedding over her of all people then you\u2019ll gladly find another man to walk you down the aisle and share dad/daughter dance with.", "Nta. Its important to you that your mom is there and happy. If dads gf is there it's going to affect mom. Even is she didn't insult her but that just makes it more obvious. I can't invite someone who isn't important to me AND ALSO insults my mom. It will cause unnecessary stress and distraction. If your dad can't get that he's delusional.", "NTA\n\nDon't invite her, make it clear to your dad you do not want her there. Kick her out if she comes, if your dad brings her knowing you didn't want her there (for obvious and good reasons too) and wants to ruin a special event maybe he shouldn't be there either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her being there would make everyone uncomfortable", "Normally you would be TA for not letting your dad choose to bring any +1 of his choosing. But in this case, if this woman has a history of inappropriately acting up or causing undue harm then it is understandable that you would not want her there. It's possible she could act up and cause a scene at your wedding, since your mom will undoubtedly be there. Your dad will not be happy but he must understand this, really. If they can be adults and admit she was out of line before and ensure you that she will act appropriately at the wedding/reception then I would consider it. But if there's a chance she will act up after having a couple of glasses of wine that would be a hard NO. Good luck and congrats on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA. Your mom deserves to enjoy your wedding and you deserve to not have to stress about what she may say or do. If your dad complains explain to him that you want a happy loving event...not a day with his mistress.", "NTA.  It is your wedding and you can invite who you want.  That being said, it sounds like you are trying to protect your mom's peace of mind as well as your own, and that's more important on your wedding day then giving your dad a plus 1.  Hopefully he understands, but if not, I guess he will have a difficult decision to make.", "NTA.  Your wedding shouldn\u2019t be a place where social awkwardness and discomfort distract from your happiness.", "NTA. Your wedding. Your choice.", "YWNBTA. This is totally reasonable", "NTA. Also, I see this idea frequently that no blame should fall on the AP, but on the person who broke their wedding vows. I believe that the blame should not fall solely on the AP as a \u201chome-wrecker,\u201d which is an outdated and often sexist way to view the situation. That said, unless the AP is unaware that their partner is in a relationship, they are also *not* blameless. AP\u2019s attitude in this particular situation is the icing on the cake. No plus one!", "NTA. even if the AP was the sweetest person ever, it would be reasonable not to invite her just because of the pain the affair caused your mom. nobody wants their mom to have to spend their child\u2019s wedding feeling heartbroken.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA\n\nas much as i hate bridezillas, you have every right to be a bridezilla here and demand she not be invited.
