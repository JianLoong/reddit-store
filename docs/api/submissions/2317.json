But be ready for dad not to come because she's not welcome. Hopefully he can be mature and understand you're trying to avoid drama on your special day. And if not? At least you're getting ahead of it before the big day. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nTell your dad it's not because she's his partner or even AP that she's not invited, it's because she verbally abused your mom and you're not having her there because of that.  No matter how your dad feels about your mom, you still love her and want her to be comfortable at your wedding.", "NTA. You're on the right side of the scale of rudeness--while parents should have plus ones, no one should ever get a plus one whose verbally abused a family member. So, you can ban that woman, and no guilt required. \n\nIf you're feeling bold, you could even say he's welcome to bring another date, just in case he's acquired more APs.  But it sounds like you're reasonable, so just know that you're doing the right thing protecting your family here.", "NTA \n\nUnfortunately you might have to damage some relationships depending on how uncompromising your father is. Just to offer this perspective, your father has showed a lack of care to how he treats or makes other people feel, ergo your mother. So I wouldn\u2019t be entirely surprised if he was dismissive and inconsiderate of your feelings. Sorry you\u2019ve had to hit a potentially rough impasse.", "NTA\n\n\"I believe the blame of ruining a marriage is on the person in the marriage, not the AP\"\n\nAnd you can still avoid an AP even you would not have blame her.", "NTA.  Dad should be invited, but AP should be disinvited.   It should be stated on Dad's invitation that he comes to the wedding only if he comes alone.   Should he arrive with AP, they should both be required to leave.   Let's hope that you have some large friends that can escort him to the door should he resist.", "NTA. Tell him that given AP\u2019s behavior towards your mother, the wronged party, that she\u2019s not invited and you\u2019re not budging. So if he\u2019s willing to miss his daughters wedding over her of all people then you\u2019ll gladly find another man to walk you down the aisle and share dad/daughter dance with.", "Nta. Its important to you that your mom is there and happy. If dads gf is there it's going to affect mom. Even is she didn't insult her but that just makes it more obvious. I can't invite someone who isn't important to me AND ALSO insults my mom. It will cause unnecessary stress and distraction. If your dad can't get that he's delusional.", "NTA\n\nDon't invite her, make it clear to your dad you do not want her there. Kick her out if she comes, if your dad brings her knowing you didn't want her there (for obvious and good reasons too) and wants to ruin a special event maybe he shouldn't be there either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her being there would make everyone uncomfortable", "Normally you would be TA for not letting your dad choose to bring any +1 of his choosing. But in this case, if this woman has a history of inappropriately acting up or causing undue harm then it is understandable that you would not want her there. It's possible she could act up and cause a scene at your wedding, since your mom will undoubtedly be there. Your dad will not be happy but he must understand this, really. If they can be adults and admit she was out of line before and ensure you that she will act appropriately at the wedding/reception then I would consider it. But if there's a chance she will act up after having a couple of glasses of wine that would be a hard NO. Good luck and congrats on your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA. Your mom deserves to enjoy your wedding and you deserve to not have to stress about what she may say or do. If your dad complains explain to him that you want a happy loving event...not a day with his mistress.", "NTA.  It is your wedding and you can invite who you want.  That being said, it sounds like you are trying to protect your mom's peace of mind as well as your own, and that's more important on your wedding day then giving your dad a plus 1.  Hopefully he understands, but if not, I guess he will have a difficult decision to make.", "NTA.  Your wedding shouldn\u2019t be a place where social awkwardness and discomfort distract from your happiness.", "NTA. Your wedding. Your choice.", "YWNBTA. This is totally reasonable", "NTA. Also, I see this idea frequently that no blame should fall on the AP, but on the person who broke their wedding vows. I believe that the blame should not fall solely on the AP as a \u201chome-wrecker,\u201d which is an outdated and often sexist way to view the situation. That said, unless the AP is unaware that their partner is in a relationship, they are also *not* blameless. AP\u2019s attitude in this particular situation is the icing on the cake. No plus one!", "NTA. even if the AP was the sweetest person ever, it would be reasonable not to invite her just because of the pain the affair caused your mom. nobody wants their mom to have to spend their child\u2019s wedding feeling heartbroken.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA\n\nas much as i hate bridezillas, you have every right to be a bridezilla here and demand she not be invited. Just be ready for your father not attending too.", "NTA", "NTA Your wedding, your choice.", "What\u2019s AP stand for? \nAlso NTA", "NTA  what's with this attitude that in the case of an affair, only the married one is wrong? If a person knowingly have an affair with a married person, then he or she is also wrong. No ifs or buts. Yes, the single person doesn't owe the other married partner anything, but they broke a social contract. The social contact is that we don't mess with married couples (unless it's an open marriage of sort).", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t uninviting \u201cyour dad\u2019s affair partner,\u201d you\u2019re choosing not to welcome *someone who verbally abused your mother when she was already distraught.*", "It\u2019s your wedding.

It takes 2 to tango. Unless she genuinely didn't know he was married she's just as much to blame as he is. And it sounds like she knew. I wouldn't have her anywhere near me let alone my mother.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom and your dad are equally at fault here - mom accepted his affairs for more than a decade - this is giving permission. And: Mom is not better than the affair partner: MOM confronted her, after first giving implicit permission: THAT caused the escalation between them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"II don\u2019t want to not give my dad a plus one at my wedding but the thought of her being there makes me very uncomfortable.\" .. **You DO understand the decission you are really making there is wheter you want your dad in your wedding or not?**", "If you go with this, working with the wedding planner or best man if you don't have a WP to have someone ready and prepared to discretely handle dad & AP and act as bouncers day of wedding.  Your mom, fiancee, and yourself should not need to handle it or even go anywhere near them.  If the bouncers do it well you wil never even know they were there.", "Affair partner  aka \"the other women\", \"the mistress\", or \"that floozy\" but less judgy language", "Agreed. Unless you are one self-centered, nasty piece of doo doo you don't date someone you know is married. You tell them you can date when they are single again. Unless of course you are one self- centered nasty piece of  shit. And surprise surprise, AP turned out to be a rotten human. Colour me chocked. \n\nThe only exception is if it is as you said, an open marriage or possibly if they're seperated  since a good while and waiting for the divorce to come through.", "Victim shaming is pathetic. OP\u2019s mom is a victim and suffered because of her husbands actions. She wanted to save the marriage because she loved him and she got hurt again. OP\u2019s father is the a hole and so is the AP. OP and their mom are not.

Are you like that mom? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OP's mom is NOT a victim.** She knowingly AGREED to 13 years of an open marriage, and then suddenly changed her mind without warning and harassed the current other woman. And NONE of this is OP's business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is considering effectively uninviting her dad ... which will break up her family even more.", "No I am not OP\u2019s mom but I do have this thing called empathy. I get that is was not smart to stay with a cheater, but what she does with her marriage is none of our business. It did however effect OP when she saw her mom get verbally attacked by the AP. Neither OP nor her mom deserved that in any way shape or form. This post is not about the fact that OP\u2019s mom stayed with her husband after the first time he cheated. It is about the a hole behavior op the AP and OP\u2019s dad. I also never saw OP mention her parents having an open relationship. Unless you saw a comment saying that then do not say it. Read the room moron."]}
