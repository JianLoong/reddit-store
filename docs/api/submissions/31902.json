People are perfectly capable of understanding they overstepped without you making a faux lesson out of their embarassement. Instead you\u2019re doing exactly what they did. Nobody actually respected anyone\u2019s boundaries so don\u2019t pretend you care about them and other\u2019s sensibilities. (This is about you insisting that she learns empathy through this - clearly YOU didn\u2019t, though? Because you\u2019re okay with embarassing her?) And we don\u2019t know the context of that conversation. But why are you going around thanking everyone for nta lol Ultimately\n\nI guess you\u2019re not gonna be friends with that girl anymore bc you\u2019re both young and silly, hope you\u2019re okay with that.", "Stop trying to teach people lessons. Use your words, set your boundaries and move on", "You could have answered with that and continued with 'how would you feel if I asked you about your pubic hair\".

Your response did not.", "Ok, look I don\u2019t really care either way how you answered, but there is no way that you \u201chelped\u201d or \u201ctaught\u201d her anything about why her specific question was inappropriate. \n\nYour \u201clesson\u201d had a big impact to be sure, guaranteed.  The lesson would be more around bungling things socially, particularly in a group. But also specifically bungling things with you, your reaction was specific to you. A lot of other young adults would have responded differently, probably using quite sophisticated humour designed to shift away from that specific comment and redirect in another direction if they didn\u2019t want to engage in that kind of communication.  Some would have been quite happy to continue to see where she was going with it. The point is they would have had more control as the technique is more sophisticated. \n\nThere is a reason with young children (when they are learning with actual teachers, not drunk teenagers) that we don\u2019t \u201creverse humiliate\u201d to teach them social rules. Because it doesn\u2019t teach \u201cempathy\u201d or \u201clevel of emotions\u201d, it teaches something else entirely.  \n\nAnyway, I just didn\u2019t want you thinking you were some teaching genius who was out there masterfully teaching everyone how to behave in a sophisticated way. You increased social friction not decreased it.\n\nEdit to note NAH, just socially clumsy.", "Right, but do you understand that people typically double down and become more hypocritical when confronted. I doubt she'll learn anything from this other than \"this guy is an asshole\" and will avoid you in future.\n\nYou could have handled it better, but instead you thought \"humiliate her, that will teach her\"\n\nChrist you're in college this may have just been a shitty attempt at flirting and you embarrassed the crap out of her.\n\nWhat she said was wrong but you could have easily just ignored, avoided, or simply said \"I don't think that's an appropriate question\".\n\nI'm sure you're just coming here for validation and won't read this, but yeah this was ESH.", "You're just trying to justify being an AH and I think you already know that.

His question had the sole purpose of \"hopefully\" making her realize her question was overstepping and \"trying to give her a taste of her own medicine so that she would see how it feels to be asked an invasive question about your private area\".\n\nThat's not a legitimate interest. That's being too insecure to tell someone they've invaded your personal space and instead resorting to passive aggressiveness.", "It has nothing to do with gender, although it is telling that you'd jump to that.\n\nIf someone asks a personal question that you feel is inappropriate, there is zero reason not to say \"Hey, this is too personal\". Only sincerely insecure people feel the need to \"retaliate\".\n\nFurthermore, OP did not \"respond in kind\", OP was passive aggressive, put a hidden meaning behind his \"question\", even admitted himself it wasn't even a legit question to begin with. Had it been a legit question and she would have gotten offended, then sure, she'd be the AH here. But with the facts as they are, person asked a question, OP got offended, didn't speak up and instead decided to go for a childish approach. That's not \"responding in kind\", that's being toxic.", "Sensitive in what way? You thought the question was too personal. So you **are** that sensitive. You need to learn to express yourself instead of resorting to tit for tat bullshit.", "The thing is, you \\*were\\* feeling sensitive, which there's nothing wrong with, and cluing people in on what you were actually thinking would let them get to know you better and establish your boundaries. What you actually said came off as weird and abrasive without the context of what's going on in your head.", "By the OP\u2019s own comment above, the conversation was heading in a risqu\u00e9 direction.  She just was heading towards the line and took a running jump over it.   I get that it is not a flirty question, but she\u2019s in college and might not fully appreciate that. When I was young, I def had guys warn me they were uncircumcised. Because they\u2019d had girls be quite shocked in the past. I can 100% see how a convo with the girls happens and she gets it in her head that she needs to find out if she\u2019s circumcised or it\u2019s an appropriate thing to ask someone she\u2019s keen to sleep with.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need an apology.

I don\u2019t get it either.", "I have actually seen a woman ask a guy if he was circumcised and when he was like \"...yeah?\" She said \"oh good, I don't fuck uncut men.\" Which was bold of her to assume he wanted to fuck her even before that disgusting ass comment. (He did not.) She was absolutely gross, normal people do not flirt that way. And she was definitely the type to rape a guy and then call him a slur for complaining, so the consent thing checks out.", "And if she was flirting, she would have been encouraged by him asking about her pubes.", "Totally not defending it personally, but I have heard other women defending \"aggressive flirting\" by saying \"men flirted like this for decades\".

After several years of it though I've grown to realize I don't actually give a fuck if a stranger thinks I might be sounding like one. No offense to you, it's just how I've got to feel about it. It's highly plausible this woman took advantage of an opportunity to become a victim, and I hate to say it, though I tend to believe it to be true to some extent at least, this is even more likely if the whole situation is in the US. I guess an incel would die on his hill defending the OP, I won't though, like I said I don't know the circumstances in detail enough to decide only I'm right and everyone else is wrong."]}
