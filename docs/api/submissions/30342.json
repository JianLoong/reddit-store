But not telling you it's fine if you don't want to go because of those activities, and especially trying to justify it because she's worried of *bad aesthetics*, and trying to make people feel guilty for not coming because *she spent so much money* is a shitty move.

Working out takes time, whatever this eating plan is takes time and probably your money.

It doesn't sound like you really her, despite calling her a close friend.\n\nYour boyfriend should have your back rather than be concerned about this being awkward. I'm not saying he needs to drop out of the wedding, but he should be furious this AH bride is dictating so much for no reason.", "Of course you shouldn't risk your health to be an aesthetic prop at this person's wedding, but that ultimately has nothing to do with it.

Tell her you're glad she's having a special day and you won't ask her to change her plans.

This is incredibly intrusive and quite offensive.\n\nI would suggest that you tell her that you don't want to participate in the training etc., with zero explanation and that if she needs you to stop down because of this, you understand.

She did help me out immensely when I was younger (rather, her parents did but they wouldn't have helped if she hadn't asked), and she held it over my head for years. I also realized how many other bad things were about our friendship, and how I dreaded seeing her whenever I'd be in town. We didn't have anything in common, she didn't invest in the friendship, and she just wanted to rehash the same things every time which were basically like her glory days (which weren't that glorious) where she felt she was better than everyone else we went to college with."]}
