Right now we are both single. What's bothering me is Julie is obsessed with sex. She acts like she is a character in Sex and the City. She overshares everything. And I think because I used to talk about sex when I was younger she still thinks that applies to current times. For what it's worth, I haven't spoken about my sex life in years.\n\nAt my birthday dinner a few years ago Julie asked me in front of our friends when the last time I had sex was and got super offended when I wouldn't answer, to the point where our friend had to step in and say \"leave her alone.\"\n\nLast month I was out with Julie and randomly she said, \"I am going to ask you a question and you are not going to like it.\" Then she said, \"when was the last time you had sex?\" Like an idiot I answered her. I had been drinking and my guard was down. My fault completely.\n\nYesterday we went out to dinner for Julie's birthday and her mom was there. At some point her mom asked why it has been so many years since I had sex. I was shocked and couldn't believe Julie told her mom my personal business. She complains so much about her mom, how she is a narcissist and she has set boundaries with her, etc. Apparently not.\n\nI was fucking pissed and embarrassed. After a few minutes I got up like I was going to the restroom and instead walked right out of the restaurant. Once I was safely on the train I texted Julie and told her I had to leave because I did not want to be there anymore after what happened.\n\nJulie is really upset and is saying she is sorry, but right now I don't think I can ever talk to her about anything again. All she does is run to her mom and blab everything. And who knows who else.\n\nAITA for walking out? I think I handled it wrong but idk I just couldn't sit there for the rest of the night and hang out like nothing happened.", "created_utc": 1699803047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tmkrm/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_friends_birthday/", "score": 2204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What made you press me twice to ask me about this then share it with your mom?'  Make HER explain HERSELF.  Maybe she's concerned for you?  Going years without sex is maybe something out of the ordinary for you and she's worried? If htat's the case, you can say than you for your concern but I don't want to talk about it with you...and she'd have to respect it.   \n But bombarding you then telling her mom, and her mom ambushes you, is not cool. T", "I don't think you're the ah for walking out, that wasn't cool of her to do at all your business isn't her mothers business, you had absolutely every right to be upset with her and i would have walked out also, im not sure why she is so invested in your sex life but i would talk to her about this weird obsession. maybe she'll finally cut it out.", "Nta maybe Julie needs a health checkup? I probably wouldn\u2019t continue this friendship", "NTA, drop Julie as a friend because she's one to you.", "NTA why would you be? Julie is super inappropriate and she knows you didnt want to talk about it. And she told her MOM? WTF who does that? This woman is 38??", "Esh. \n\nYou know Julie and you are judging her based on standards that have changed for you. You are expecting her to change her behaviour simply because you have. You stated that you both used to talk about sex all the time. She still does. it's you that's changed not her and from the sound of it the reason isn't maturity related. It's just that it's just been a while since you were regularly having sex. \n\nNow she shouldn't have told anyone else your business and she should have simply  took your refusal to speak about the subject the first time but as her friend these are traits that I'd think you'd have seen before. In that she's maybe told you other peoples business.  Behaviours like that don't pop up out of the blue.\n\nHer mother shouldn't have brought it up at all and should have minded her own business.\n\nThere was nothing wrong at all with you leaving because you were uncomfortable with the situation but you shouldn't judge your friend harshly  if her behaviour hasn't changed and you knew she was like this", "NTA", "NTA, her mum was probably attempting to set up a dialogue that ended with you sleeping with her daughter, in an attempt to spark a relationship that possibly provided grandchildren.\n\nMates for 25 years, both single... Yeah that's my guess.\nMums are crazy dude.", "NTA Tell her you are going to share with everybody one embarrassing thing about her. Do it. Then begin the healing.", "NTA. Personally, Im fairly open about my intimacy, and I would be completely shocked if I found out one of my friends was sharing that stuff with their parents. The fact that she effectively pried the info out of you before spreading it makes this even worse. Youre 100% NTA, and your friend needs to learn to respect boundaries before it bites her in the butt", ">AITA for walking out?\n\nNo, you showed remarkable restraint by simply leaving.  I would have torn her a new asshole.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you handled it better than I would have. Someone who would tell your business to the whole world is not someone you should keep around. You thought you could confide in her. I\u2019m in a similar situation. I haven\u2019t had sex in years. I just haven\u2019t been able to find anyone, but my best friend doesn\u2019t care, thankfully. You don\u2019t need someone like that in your life.", "Nta, and you had a very mature reaction. She had no business sharing that.", "NTA.  It sounds like she\u2019s trying to have some kind of \u201csex positive\u201d intervention for you.  I doubt she would let up if you didn\u2019t make it crystal clear this was a dealbreaker.  And if that deal is already broken, that\u2019s entirely on her.", "NTA. Julie isn't your friend and may never have been. End your association with her. She's nosy and has bad boundaries.", "NTA I would have done the same", "I respectfully disagree, OP.\n\nI think you handled it **perfectly**.\n\nJulie is not your friend,  she is just a gossip with no sense of either boundaries, or decorum.\n\nCut her out of your life.\n\nNTA.", "Sounds like you need to get laid", "NTA\nAsk them about their sex life while at a party & see if they are fine with it.", "NTA and I would not trust her with a baking recipe after this.", "NTA. You left before escalating things.", "NTA. I think I\u2019d have thrown a drink.", "NTA\n\nBut how long was it?", "NTA, your friend proved that she can't be trusted.", "NTA.\n\nPeople need to understand that sharing isn't licensing - they can't re-share without your consent.\n\nFor what it is worth, I think you handled it very well, you had the courtesy not to embarrass them in front of others (rightfully so, if you ask me), but was also honest enough to let her know in private right away.", "NTA.  Drop this friend.  She is too immature.  You want to hang out with people who respect boundaries and mature.", "NTA, what a betrayal of trust. I had a friend of 30 years I wrote off completely because of their behavior so I know from experience it happens.", "Nta", "NTA  \nI wouldn't have reacted as well as you did.  \nI would have probably replied \"I am surprised Julie told you something so private! She is always complaining about how nosey and narcissistic you are.\"", "NTA - you felt uncomfortable so you changed the situation untill you weren\u2019t uncomfortable. You were polite in not causing a scene and texting once away from the place.", "NTA, I had a \u201cfriend\u201d who did shit like this and years later I realized they were just a narcissist who used me to prop themselves up.\n\nWalking away is a powerful thing to do, I think you should feel good about how you handled it.", "Trust no one,, ever.", "NTA. You behaved with dignity, which is more that I can say for your friend and her mother. Next time her mother asks when you last had sex, look at your watch and say, 'What time is it now?', and then add, 'By the way, it was with your husband!'", "You knew Julie was like this. You are NTA, but if it happens again, then you definitely are. She doesn't respect your boundaries and you are now \ud83d\udcaf aware of it. Don't expect her to change either.", "NTA I think you need to accept that your friendship with Julie has run its course.", "NTA", "NTA, but why did you put quotes around Julie instead of around \u201cfriend\u201d?\n\nFriends don\u2019t treat you like that.", "NTA oh my goodness", "NTA.  From now on, make stuff up and tell Julie. \u201cI went on a date last weekend. He was a great guy.   And I thought about all the sex you were having. So I went for it.  It was amazing.  We took a break when his buddy texted.  He had to brag to his buddy about me.  I told him to invite him over.  We had a 3some and it was amazing. !!!\u201d   \nMake the stories more wild and crazy and pretty soon she will catch on that you are pulling her leg.  After that she won\u2019t know what to believe and will stop asking.  \n\nJust my 2 cents.", "Agreed. It feels so weird that someone, even a close \"friend\", would be that obsessed with OP's sex life. Like, why does it matter? Some people have lower sex drives or libidos, or don't really care about sex at all. In an age where we are learning how much sex and sexuality is a spectrum, it feels very weird and intrusive for anyone to be so concerned about someone else's sex life.\n\nNTA, OP", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she's setting a new boundary with this friend. Leaving is a great way to make it clear \u2014 this crossed a boundary, there is a cost.\n\nThe friend may really get it from this one situation *or* it may take escalating consequences to maintain this boundary. Regardless, I think it's awesome that the OP set this boundary.", "\"Because your husband doesn't call me back anymore\"", "Because Julie is a narcissist like her mother and likes to manipulate people like OP for fun.", "I think other people were there; that was her concern", "Bingo", "Who's MOM goes around prying into their friend's sex lives??!?!", ">NTA. Fuck around and find out. Julie fucked around\n\nLiterally and figuratively!", "Their ages are not the problem. OP's sex life isn't the problem. The problem is that Julie shared a part of OP's personal life with someone who was not present when the information was told. That is a violation of OP's privacy. \n\n\nOP is in no way TA.", "Maybe not everyone wants to have frequent sex (or sex at all for that matter)?", "Troll Account. Downvote and ignore.", "Even my *gynecologist* stopped asking if/when someone was last sexually active and instead just asks if there\u2019s any chance of pregnancy or if you have concerns about potential STIs and wanna get tested.", "For what it\u2019s worth, I have a couple people in my life who are weirdly obsessed with my romantic life and often ask me specific questions (when they\u2019re drunk) and it is always weird.\n\nI usually just say whatever or I just say that I don\u2019t care to talk about this, but\u2026yeah, people interested in other peoples romantic adventures is definitely a thing that happens.\nBut I always feel awkward during those conversations.", "Could be by feeding her mother stories about her friend she can get mum off her back about shit. When her mum starts asking the same shit, she can deflect and make comments about OP. thinking it was harmless and her mum doesn't interact with OP, so figured no harm no foul. \n\nI have a few friends like this. they struggle with boundaries so violate other people's to stop their own being pushed. \n\nI generally don't share deeply personal stuff with many people and those I do are guaranteed to not break them. They tell me enough about them to ensure mutually assured destruction if they decided to use my stuff for gossip. Plus they're not like that and part of why we are close friends.", "[removed]", "Julie probably has tumbleweeds rolling through her \\*bleep\\* and is trying to live vicariously through other people. She plays it up she's going through life horizontally but the truth is probably anything but.", "OP said her friend thinks she\u2019s a character in \u201c Sex and the City\u201d. \nShe FAFO.", "So if you say something personal to a friend while alone with them and having a few drinks, then that means they should be allowed to tell anyone else at any time, and it\u2019s your fault for having intimate drinking moments with said friend?", "Well, we know vulnerable women should never be around u/chemicalwitty", "Someone woke up and chose violence today, I see.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Outstanding \ud83d\udc4f", "It could be the thing that society has ingrained in women the need to play nice and politely laugh off any awkward situations. OP probably thought she should have stayed at the party and just taken the intrusive questions with aplomb as a woman is expected to do. Though she even politely just left the table in an unobtrusive way instead of making a scene so she still managed to appease \"society\".  Not sure I would have managed that. Lots of these people are so beaten down and repressed by the expectations of others they can't see the forest for the trees. No reasonable person would think they are an AH but in their particular social circle, everyone is making them feel like an AH because those people are part of the problem.", "Leaving a restaurant without saying so at the table, possibly without ordering/paying isn't something most people ever do, so it's difficult to figure out if the reaction fits the cause. In addition to feeling betrayed by a formerly close friend and giving them the benefit of the doubt.", "I don\u2019t see why she would be expected to sit there and listen to people gossip and talk about her sex life. \n\nIt makes no sense to me that anyone would expect her to do so. So I\u2019m trying to figure out why she thinks it would make her an asshole.", "That's assuming the other party actually has a sense of shame in the first place", "Sounds like Juile\u2019s mom is pushing for details like this and Julie is supplying them.   \n\nWeird dynamic.  Totally worth losing a friend who treats personal details as public information. NTA", "Narcissistic apple didn't fall far from the narcissistic tree.", "It's 2023. Pretty common topic. I'm just not uptight.", "I love when I'm asked if i could be pregnant. I laugh and say 15 years post menopause with my tubes tied. Highly unlikely.", "i share a lot with my mom, but it\u2019s definitely a different dynamic to \u201cjulie\u201d and her mom. i often share details about my friends with my mom (in strict confidence) as shes very good with advice and im lucky i feel close enough that i can talk to her about anything. she would never tell anyone any of these things and would never judge, i do draw the line with very personal things (especially if the confider has sworn me to secrecy) but this for example (i mean its a bad example because my mom wouldnt ask about mt friends sex life but if she did i guess i would tell her\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02 but only because i trust her not to use it to make my friend feel uncomfortable in fromt of others). definitely sounds like julie and her mom have some issues to work through", "What a gross thing to say.

Do better.", "Even better if she's a widow", "This is something that isn't talked enough about. I left an abusive friendship over 5 years ago now, probably closer to 10 than 5 at this point, and it's incredibly traumatic. I only could do it because my other three best friends online and my irl best friend at the time had my back.", "Plus when you're close to someone who massively oversteps boundaries for a large chunk of your life, it becomes \"normal\". It can be really hard to see what's wrong and really easy to play down things that are normal to us because that's what we're used to. That's why so many people seek an outside opinion", "I wasn\u2019t saying she should. I agree with you.  I have marched out of situations myself.  But in those situations everyone knew at least what upset me, if not exactly why.  And I\u2019ve dropped a message to the innocent ones in apology for leaving.

Years afterward we started chatting again and every now and then we would bring up a small part of the past issue and discuss it, reflect on it, move past it.
