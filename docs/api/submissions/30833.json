Right now we are both single. What's bothering me is Julie is obsessed with sex. She acts like she is a character in Sex and the City. She overshares everything. And I think because I used to talk about sex when I was younger she still thinks that applies to current times. For what it's worth, I haven't spoken about my sex life in years.\n\nAt my birthday dinner a few years ago Julie asked me in front of our friends when the last time I had sex was and got super offended when I wouldn't answer, to the point where our friend had to step in and say \"leave her alone.\"\n\nLast month I was out with Julie and randomly she said, \"I am going to ask you a question and you are not going to like it.\" Then she said, \"when was the last time you had sex?\" Like an idiot I answered her. I had been drinking and my guard was down. My fault completely.\n\nYesterday we went out to dinner for Julie's birthday and her mom was there. At some point her mom asked why it has been so many years since I had sex. I was shocked and couldn't believe Julie told her mom my personal business. She complains so much about her mom, how she is a narcissist and she has set boundaries with her, etc. Apparently not.\n\nI was fucking pissed and embarrassed. After a few minutes I got up like I was going to the restroom and instead walked right out of the restaurant. Once I was safely on the train I texted Julie and told her I had to leave because I did not want to be there anymore after what happened.\n\nJulie is really upset and is saying she is sorry, but right now I don't think I can ever talk to her about anything again. All she does is run to her mom and blab everything. And who knows who else.\n\nAITA for walking out? I think I handled it wrong but idk I just couldn't sit there for the rest of the night and hang out like nothing happened.", "created_utc": 1699803047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tmkrm/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_friends_birthday/", "score": 498, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
