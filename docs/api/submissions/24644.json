And no sleepovers for the kids. She'll try to leave them with you, or stay herself.

You gave plenty of time and help. \n\nNTA", "Thank you. I often feel conflicted I was raised to be kind of selfish and take care of myself before anyone else ( of course take care of my kids too) so for the last year  I\u2019ve been pretty frugal and focused and wasn\u2019t sure if that was hindering being a kind person", "NTA. Trish, by asking you about the house, was trying to finagle her way into getting more free housing from you. You have given her plenty of notice by sharing your plans with her and keeping her up to date on your house hunt. She should not have assumed that she\u2019d be going with you. \n\nShe\u2019s also being a pretty entitled AH by spending your money for you and allocating a certain amount for her by saying that you have more than enough money to \u201chelp her and still buy a house\u201d. \n\nThis person is honestly not your friend. Think of yourself and your children first because Trish sure isn\u2019t going to do so.", "NTA. You may be her friend, but she is not yours.

She wants you to keep working two jobs so she doesn\u2019t have to get one?  \n\nShe\u2019ll try to use guilt, begging and the single mom card to get a key to your new place.  And the fact that nobody else will take her in means she\u2019s already burned those bridges.  But here\u2019s the thing\u2026you worked, saved, took care of your kids and did it all.  So can she.  If she wanted to.\n\nSo congrats on saving up and getting a house in this economy.  Not easy.

Then, once things were 100% finalized for your family, she still had 45ish days to again, get her ass into gear & figure out a plan. You helped her out (did she contribute anything financially while renting?) & now she\u2019s mad she can no longer mooch off of your kindness. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m a pessimist, but hold off on giving her your new address.

Congratulations on your new home, btw & best of luck with the moving process!", "NTA.  This was temporary, not something you signed up for forever.  I appreciate your friend's not wanting to put her children in daycare, but we all do what we have to do to make our way in this world.  Sounds like Trish has been happy to rely on you and not done anything to take responsibility for her housing needs. \n\nYou didn't agree to a long-term situation, and you've given lots of notice.  The rest is up to Trish.  For her to try to guilt you into being responsible for her and her children is not reasonable.  You HAVE helped her but clearly she's not done what she needs to do during the time with you to help herself.  She has options and she needs to take them ASAP. \n\nCan't believe she had the nerve to tell you that you had enough money to continue letting them stay with you.  Wow.

Fuck her. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s time for her to put on her big girl pants and be a self sufficient adult.", "NTA. She's a grown adult. She is 100% not your burden to carry, and given that she seems to think she's entitled to having anyone else support it, I'm not surprised she doesn't have any options.\n\nYou aren't leaving her with no where to go. Her own life choices have gotten her to this place. Do not let her emotionally manipulate you into thinking anything else!", "NTA- it\u2019s nice you helped her out for as long as you did, but the entire time she was living with you she should have been saving up for a new place knowing that it wasn\u2019t a permanent solution.", "NTA.  You told her from day one what you were doing.  At no point did ypu change your mind and tell her she would be coming with you.  Absolutely NTA.  \n\nShe has no problem using her kids as a weapon while manipulating you and just expecting you to take care of her - imposing her entire existence on your being - you should have no qualms about taking care of your family and continuing on with what you literally told her you would be doing since day 1.  \n\nShe sounds as if she is quite the person.  Advice if I may?  Do *not* allow her a single night in your new home.  You will never, *ever*, get her out of there.  \n\nAnd the kids - she should have thought about them the last six months.  Not dumped the responsibility on you at the last minute.  This will never end if you let her follow.", "NTA - She doesn't sound like much of a friend.", "NTA - unfortunately being a stay at home mom isn\u2019t an option for Trish.  It sucks for her, but it\u2019s reality check time, and time for a job and low income housing.  If she doesn\u2019t want her kids in daycare she could look for alternate options, like an in home babysitter, working overnight shifts and having her kids stay with a family member, etc.", "NTA - only an AH assumes they get to move into your new house with you and acts offended when they learn that's not the plan - the entitlement, good lord! She has two kids and she has done nothing to ensure their safety and stability; that's on HER.", "Yeah strong NTA. You have already done her a huge favour by letting her live with you this long.", "NTA- Sounds like your *friend* thinks you're her new *spouse*. It's not your job to provide for her and her family. You gave her plenty of help and warning about her change in situation.", "NTA - You already have three dependents, you don\u2019t need three more and never volunteered to subsidize their life. She thought if she just pushed you to house and pay for her life, you would just roll over and do it. She has two kids to care for, it\u2019s time to get a job and actually care for them. She and her family are not your responsibility. You gave her plenty of warning to get it together and it\u2019s on her, not you, that she hasn\u2019t done it.", "NTA please get rid of Trish the freeloader. She\u2019s not your friend. Entitled person she is.", "NTA she had plenty of time to figure something out.", "NTA She should not have just assumed she and her kids could move with you.", "You are NOT leaving her with nowhere to go. Her own decisions are doing that. You did what you could, which is all anyone can do. She is not your responsibility. She should have thought about housing for her children before she got pregnant with them. She should have thought about it all this time she has been with you. She is responsible for her choices. You are not. Go in peace. You deserve it.", "NTA, but your rather entitled friend is.", "She is not your responsibility. Just do what you have to do for yourself and your children.", "Nta, op, you have 2 jobs to support your family and being able to buy a house for you and your kids. \nShe doesn\u2019t want to work because she doesn\u2019t want her kids in the daycare. \n\nIn the end those 2 things are CHOICES. We as parents make the best ones for our families. You are doing for yours at least. But she is an adult that is making a choice, is her responsibility to figure it out", "NTA make her leave now. I wouldn't risk her trying to stay put and sabotaging you move", "NTA. She can get a job, but doesn\u2019t want to, and her reasoning is BS. Daycare is a reality for working parents, especially single ones.", "NTA!!!!what a wonderful thing you've done for her, it's too bad that she doesn't see it that way.  She has enough notice that she can find a place. \n\nCongrats on your new home!", "NTA. You did a nice thing by giving her somewhere to stay and we\u2019re clear you would not be remaining at that property when you bought your own place. No ordinary person would take that to mean that they would love with you. Your friend Trish is crazy to think it\u2019s unreasonable of you to say no to her, and your friends that agree with her are crazy too. You have no responsibility to house her and it\u2019s her own fault for having somewhere to stay and doing nothing to save money to get her own place.", "NTA, and make sure you do NOT let her stay over at the new house or she'll never leave. It's pretty clear she wants others to take care of her difficulties. Enjoy the house!", "NTA. Your friend left herself without anwhwere else to go. Ugh, I can't stand leeches like this!", "She doesn't want to put her kids in daycare but is willing to let them be all but homeless? I'm constantly amazed at how ridiculous people can really be. Nta. Congratulations and enjoy your new home.", "classic, I have kids so you have to help me", "NTA, its your house and youve been very vocal with her. Shes freeloading off you, its a tough situation im sure but taking care of her is not your responsibility.", "Omg NTA . If she wanted to be a sahm then she should have had kids with a man that could have provided her with that. Not your responsibility to make it possible for her.  Now she can find a way to work from home or get over it.", "NTA - She is not your responsibility. She is a grown-ass woman.", "Have Trish post an AITA question here.", "NTA. Trish is a selfish, manipulative, leech. Don't let her get too attached.", "NTA. How entitled and ungrateful she sounds. You aren\u2019t responsible for providing for her family. She is.", "NTA that woman is a leach", "NTA - she does not see you as a friend, she see's you as a meal ticket.", "NTA. \n\nAnother person who seems to not understand **personal** responsibility...", "File this one under \"no good deed goes unpunished\", sadly.\n\nInventory all your belongings, and make sure nothing \"accidentally\" goes missing.\n\nCongratulations on your new home!\n\nNTA", "Better check the legalities - you don\u2019t want to make problems for your landlord if she refuses to move\u2026.", "NTA.  The only thing you did wrong was let her move in at all.  Do not let her move with you.  She\u2019s a leech.", "NTA - Trish is a freeloader!", "Hold up she's excepting you to pay for her housing cost? I'd tell her to kick rocks", "You have worked hard to support your own family not Trish and her family. N.t.a", "NTA at all\n\nYou extended a huge kindness, we\u2019re open about what was coming and followed through. You do not have to feel any guilt whatsoever here", "Sounds like her family realized she was a leech already and cut her off. Time for you to realize the same. It's sad but people like this need to hit rock bottom to find their legs and learn to get off their ass", "Nta there was never another plan for her, if you let her move with you, you\u2019d be supporting her and her kids. You gave her a great option and she needs to be forced to take it. Think of your kids, your extra resources need to go to them", "NTA, your main priority is to care and support your children, not to help a woman who won't care for herself.", "NTA You never should have allowed her to move in with you in the first place. This is what happens. They move in and you are stuck with them. She should be grateful for the time she had, but when you told her you were selling, she should have looked for a place and not just expected you to take care of her. Being nice sometimes backfires", "NTA. She\u2019s a freeloader and you cannot put your life on hold to convenience her.", "NTA, that entitlement! How could she possibly assume you are buying house to include her as well?!  She should be ashamed. You work 2 jobs while she doesn't have any and she expects you to support her with your hard work. You need to turn your back on her.", "NTA, she's just sad her freeloading days are over. I'd have more sympathy if she was busting her butt trying to make her own money, but she is using \"daycare\" as an excuse. I feel very sorry for her children. Enjoy your new home and cut things off with Trish. I would, however, give her a list of places that can help with temporary displacement, food pantries, help for kids, shelters. If she actually cares about her family, she'll work to ensure her kids utilize the resources available. I definitely don't believe anyone should be homeless, but mooching is not the way.", "No you should ditch that leech", "NTA AT ALL. Your priority is caring for your children. It\u2019s time for her to do the same for her own.", "NTA. Your friend's a mooch.", "NTA. It's absurd that she expects you to subsidize her and her family. Truly NTA, you shouldn't give it another thought. Also, shame on her for trying to take advantage of you and for trying to guilt you. She doesn't seem like a friend at all.", "Absolutely NTA. Why would she think you were joking or didn\u2019t mean it when you told her you would be moving. Or did she seriously think you would buy a house they could move to with you?! Talk about entitled!", "NTA she\u2019s an idiot and an entitled one at that", "NTA", "NTA- this lady has overstayed her welcome. Your kids are your first priority. She\u2019s the one who needs to step up.", "NTA. You already helped her and owe her nothing. Stay firm on her finding her own way.", "NTA. She is a grown woman with two children to take care of. You gave notice of the upcoming changes, and she elected not to do a damned thing to protect herself and her children\u2019s stability and safety. She should have been finding other housing. You may have \u201cmore than enough money\u201d but that is your own money, used to give yourself and your children a stable life. She is capable of doing the same. She hasn\u2019t. I get why you may feel bad about her kids, but there\u2019s not much you could do to change their situation.", "NTA. Your friend is a leech and very entitled. You'll do well to cut her off from your life, otherwise she'll use and use you until she has drained you completely.", "NTA. She's a bum. Tell her she can have the box from the mew refrigerator you buy for the house you earned while she sat on her ass mooching.", "NTA, had this happen once to my mom with a friend of hers. I was about 13 and I had my little sister plus my mom in a small 2 room apartment. She would ask for my laptop to \"send e mails\" when in reality most of the time she was browsing through Facebook. She also faked that she had cancer for pitty, and one time I entered my room to see her naked looking at herself in the mirror doing poses. \n\nWe were going away for a weekend and my mom didn't trust her to leave her alone with the apartment so she told her she had to leave, so there we were, getting ready to go to a weekend hotel and she was sitting on the stoop leading to my apartment all crossed armed and pissed. \n\nSo, NO! Never let people who tend to overstay to continue staying any longer!! You don't owe them anything.", "NTA, you have your own life and responsibilities.
