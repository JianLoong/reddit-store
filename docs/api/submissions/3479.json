Edit :NTA", ">My brother said I'm making excuses for shitty behaviour.\n\n...and you have a 'get out of babysitting' card handed to you.", "NTA, parentification of children is child abuse. You refuse to watch those kids anymore and if they drop them off when you are alone, you call the police and tell them someone dropped off their children at your house. I also don't know where a jar of laundry pods was being kept that a 2 year old could get at it. That's not even like childproofing, that just seems negligent. Most pod containers have childproof lids on it, I don't know why you'd bother transferring them to a jar.", "NTA", "Huge NTA and I just want to tell you how impressed I am in how you handled your nephew's emergency!!!!! You did everything right and he is okay because of YOU. \n\nYour brothers are a-holes. The accident happened because of them. The fact your nephew wasn't seriously harmed is because of you. \n\nThree more years - hang in there. \u2764", "Good Gods sweetheart you are NTA!\n\nYou are *a child*. A. **child**. \n\nYou are being abused by the people in your life, you are not at fault for their being AHs.", "Duckling. \ud83d\ude0d", "I don\u2019t think the family consider this a favour. This is clearly seen as an obligation by them all. The reason why this stinks op is because you\u2019re surrounded by assholes. \n\nIt also sounds like you don\u2019t have an option other than going with it. I would consider looking at becoming a paid babysitter, find others that are willing to pay you for it, and slowly ghost the services for your family. Start saving some money to become self sufficient.", "The parents here aren't so great either. This wouldn't be happening without their approval.", "Probably a mysoginistic conservative family and not a choice.", ">Sadly, they are adding two more to the current three--can you imagine how bad it will be for OP then?     \n>  \n>At OP's age, and with her parents insistence, I don't see her situation getting better. Unless she feels safe enough to resist their directives and go on full strike.", "NTA that is very overwhelming and you were actively dealing with issues with 2 of the 3 kids not ignoring them and watching tv or something irresponsible. You did nothing wrong and did the best that you could in the situation you were in. I don\u2019t know your situation so don\u2019t show this to your parents if it\u2019s not safe to do so but they should be ashamed of themselves for blaming and grounding you when you did the best you could in a situation your brothers never should have put you in. Your brothers were irresponsible and need to smarten up and your parents are terrible for punishing you.", "The brothers should have practiced before they had kids", "OP said they were M20s. So \"in their 20s.\" Not 20.", "One of the babies was born to a 15yo dad.", "This is great advice. Say you are too scared to babysit now.", "Seriously, being called duckling by an internet mom\nIs the cutest thing ever. Also her advice was very sound.", "Yes, OP needs to be less available.  Some kind of job would do the trick.", "Yess!!!", "It sure was! She's a wise Internet mom."]}
