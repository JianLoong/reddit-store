I'm the oldest of our fathers 13 kids, that's a whole separate story and issues lol. \n\nMy brother got a girl (20f) pregnant 2 months shy of his 18th birthday (she was 18.5) while they were on and off dating. From the get go I told him I'm happy for him but considering they weren't exclusive, and basically children, it's best he gets a paternity test done just to be 100% that the child is his. They were not married, still aren't, and we live in a state where it is VERY difficult for a father to get anything after a split. \n\nHe told me I was just untrusting, I pointed out the lies the girls mother told to try and get a restraining order against my brother. It was proven to be a lie when the vet she tried bribe to claim my brother was abusing the animals ratted her out. Even after the girlfriend backed up the mother, he stayed with her and said I just didn't understand. Okay fine, I can't make him leave her obviously, so I stayed out of it. \n\nGirl gives birth, he signs the BC, the ROP, all of it. Against so many family protests, mine, his mother's, our dad's (which was VERY surprising because our dad does not care about any of us).\n\nFlash forward to the baby being 7 months and my brother decides to leave her. She blocked him and took off with the child. When my brother finally got a hold of her, he was told \"It's probably not yours anyways so I don't have to tell you anything about where he is\" \n\nNow my brothers got a lawyer to attempt to figure this all out. The girl is refusing a DNA test because \"It's too late you signed it all and the other possibly dad makes less so you get to pay child support\" as well as making a lot of abuse claims and constantly posting on Facebook, Instagram, etc about it. \n\nMy brother keeps asking me for legal advice and what to do. I told him from the start I have no idea I've never been through this so I cannot help. He wants me giving him every step. I finally snapped and told him no way in hell, if he'd done what we'd all told him from the beginning he could have avoided all of this. Because in our state, even if hes proven DNA wise not to be the dad he's legally still responsible unless the girl gives up the other name, and he gets tested. But she won't because in her own words \"The other guy barely makes any money and I want enough child support to live off\" \n\nNow my brother thinks I'm abandoning him in his time of need, when in reality I'm just tired. I tried helping him and he refused to listen now. He dug his grave now he needs to lie in it because me and many others told him how he could have avoided this.

He didn't listen now he's in crap reminds me of another post on here where the guy tried to fight for his right to be in his kids life but the girl and her family were monsters. And did everything under the sun to destroy him until he signed over his rights because they ruined his reputation so bad in his town. 15 years later his daughter found out the truth and fought with the mom and her step-dad then kept running away.

That isn\u2019t funny, but I thought I\u2019d mention that to lighten up the mood. Secondly, he needs to get that paternity test regardless of the state being strict on moms getting custody. The state usually picks up the paternity testing if she filed for child support, or any kind of state aid, food stamps, Medicaid (insurance) or whatever. If he\u2019s gotten an attorney, then those questions he asks you need to be redirected to his attorney. Tell him that you will support him in any decision he makes, but you\u2019re not holding his hand because he knew the consequences of having unprotected sex, and assuming she was on some kind of contraceptive. From what I have read here, it\u2019s going to be one nasty, drawn out, emotionally draining process that he\u2019s about to go through. For legally reasons, he needs to get a simple notebook and start writing dates and times down when he has made contact with his baby\u2019s mom, and how it went, etc. phone calls, letters, emails, any kind of contact, write that shit down. With that being said, it\u2019s not your responsibility for being there every step of the way, but you can show support to him and explain that to him. It sounds like y\u2019all had a pretty tough life, and he turned to you for support. So NTA.", "NTA - play stupid games win stupid prizes.

It's extremely unlikely that he will get *full* custody, they won't revoke a parent's custody without a damn good reason. Family court will probably do something like 50/50 or 60/40.
