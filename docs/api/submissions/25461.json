{"id": 25461, "submission_id": "160t7sj", "title": "AITA for giving my mum's coworker the finger?", "selftext": "I, (f17), was out on a walk at around 4 pm, the time that my mum gets off work. As I was out, someone drove past me, beeped at me twice, and drove off quite fast.\n\nI knew they were beeping at me because there were no other cars on the road and they slowed down when they reached me.\n\nI have been beeped at multiple times while walking by people I did not know. I know this because if someone beeps at me, I usually look to see who it is. Also, if it is someone I know, they roll down the window to say hello. \n\nThis person had tinted windows, a large car so I could not see the driver, and they drove off so quickly that I couldn't see who it was.\n\nUnknown people have beeped at me numerous times while I was out for a walk. Men in taxis, on motorbikes, in maintenance cars etc. I am TIRED of being beeped at. I am a 17 year old girl and it is so unfortunate that I have to deal with idiots in cars who think beeping at women to get their attention is okay and not terrifying at all.\n\nWhen the person (unknown to me at the time) drove away, I gave them the finger. I have never done this before because I always feared something bad would happen to me. I genuinely believed it was some stupid guy trying to get me to notice him. I did not see who the person was, so if I knew it was someone my mum worked with, I would not have done that.\n\nWhen I got home from my walk, my mum said her male coworker messaged her to say I had given him the finger when he drove by, and that he was really offended by what I had done. I don't know this man, I met him once at a work event. She seemed very upset because now this will harm her relationship with him and it is important for her, she says, as a woman to have a good reputation. I understand her situation, even though I think it's ridiculous. I apologised to her, but I told her not to say that I apologise to her male coworker as well. I said that while I will avoid giving people who beep at me the finger, I will never apologise for giving it in the first place.\n\nI told her people have no right to beep at me like that on the road. It's terrifying, especially as a minor and a woman, and that if someone wants to say hello to me while I'm out, they should roll down their window and wave. She said even if they do beep for the purpose of being creepy, I should ignore them and just keep walking to avoid further conflict. I said I agreed and that I wouldn't do it again to stay safe.\n\nSo, AITA for unknowingly giving my mum's coworker the finger because I thought I was being harassed by some creep?\n\nEdit: Why are there so many comments lecturing me on the consequences of me giving the finger? Why don't you lecture the assholes that go around honking at women trying to get some fresh air? \ud83e\udd14", "created_utc": 1692952240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160t7sj/aita_for_giving_my_mums_coworker_the_finger/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, flipping people off isn't likely to make friends or influence people, and as you're finding, other people don't generally take too kindly to it no matter how dumb what they did to receive such a salute was.  You're free to flip people off who you think might be wronging you, but even if you have the right to do so, you aren't free of consequences, and neither are people in your life who might know the person you've flipped off.

So yea as an adult he should know what that kind of behavior could be mistaken for and that its understandable for you to behave that way. If it was me in his place i d apologise through tour mom instead of complaining and say that it was just a friendly gesture that got mistaken", ">I told her people have no right to beep at me like that on the road. It's terrifying, especially as a minor and a woman, and that if someone wants to say hello to me while I'm out, they should roll down their window and wave.\n\nOP, you\u2019re 100% correct here. And based on the way he sped off and didn\u2019t even roll the window down, he didn\u2019t even look like he was trying to say hi.", "I say beeping, but I saw someone write honking in the comments and I realized that's the right word \ud83d\ude06 also, sometimes cars go beep beep instead of honk honk, so maybe both are right?", "Apparently, he just wanted me to acknowledge him and wave... which is weird considering I don't bloody know the guy.", "She does not owe him an explanation. I would call HR and explain that they should have a conversation with that coworker why it is absolutely inappropriate to horn on a girl, especially when he is an adult man and she is a minor.", "That would be on mum, not OP.", "She did nothing wrong, the dude in the car should learn that harassment will have consequences. Should I be her mom, I would report him to HR.", "Yeah plus you said his windows are tinted. Chalk it up to a misunderstanding. Nothing more than that", "You acknowledge him with a one finger wave. Partial credit I say. \ud83d\ude02", "Definitely - OP even mentioned that _she_ doesn't know the guy. \nAnd that leads to the question, how and why does he know who his coworker's teenage daughter is? Major creepy vibes from this guy.", "100 per cent agree, she does not owe him any explanation.   \n\n\nHowever, learning her perspective might change his tune from 'offended' to 'wow, i never thought of it that way, or considered all that runs through a woman's mind when she is honked at, on a dark night.'  \n\n\nApologies if I was not clear.", "HR protects the company, not the employee, unless those priorities align.  Someone honking at an employee's daughter outside of work isn't an HR problem, and neither would be someone getting flipped off by someone else's daughter outside of work.\n\nBoth of these people should grow up a bit.  Flipping someone off isn't illegal in a lot of places, but it isn't free from consequences either.", "NTA I flip everyone off all the time \ud83d\ude02 \nAlso your moms weird coworker that you met one time in passing does not need to be honking the horn to get a 17 year olds attention.

If I were you, I'd ask your mother to confront her colleague at least for honking at her minor daughter and making her feel uncomfortable. As simple as that.", "Mum is definitely proud, and she told me so. But because we live in a very conservative country, her other colleagues may not understand why this behaviour can be seen as harassment.", "Exactly, what a creep! I wouldn't be surprised if he actually honked at a young girl on the street, and only later realised it was his coworker's daughter, so he decided offence was the best defence, just in case", "I\u2019m based in the UK. We definitely use the word beep at times to describe the action of pressing the car horn to attract someone\u2019s attention. Personally I think it depends on the car (some have horns that do sound like they beep rather than honk) and the situation.", "\"Beeping\" is what we say in Australia too, \"Honking\" is mostly North American English.", "I don't want to make friends with a creepy ass grown man, thanks!", "i have no idea, but i love beeping. it makes md think of the sound the roadrunner in the cartoons makes. like \"meep, meep\". it made me smile. \ud83d\ude0a", "Ew, so he is one of *those guys*"]}
