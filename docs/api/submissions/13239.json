The folks you're describing sound like horrible people, but your husband is also an adult who can and should be allowed to make his own decisions. Where it's reasonable to set a *boundary* would be to say \"Okay, but don't bring your friend home/to places where I and/or our kids (if you have kids) are exposed to this guy.\"", "Just out of curiosity, why is the single woman a whore but no such derogatory term has been applied to the cheating man? YTA for your obvious misogyny.", "INFO Are you afraid your husband will be persuaded by this man? Are you afraid his GF will hit on your husband? What do the others in the friend group say? How does the friend groups behave to these people? Surely you aren\u2019t the only one who thinks this. Can I ask one question that is at the forefront of all of these, why would your husband WANT to continue to be friends with this man? Edit; I just saw the ages here. I am not comprehending why a man( your husband) would want to stay friends with someone like this. Might get some hate, but seriously? He is a very grown man. Character in friends count, doesn\u2019t it?", "Esh - you don't get to forbid your husband from doing anything. Your husband for apparently being okay with the bf's behavior.", "ESH except your best friend. You can't tell your husband what to do,  you can only say how it makes you feel. He shouldn't be sneaking around to see them. And the cheaters, yeah, obviously.  \n\nYou're also kind of a jerk for calling her a whole, and not being equally ugly about him. It's both of their fault", "YTA for the wording. You cant FORBID an adult from doing something. You can have a conversation where you explain how hurt this makes you feel. You can also choose to not be married to someone you don\u2019t trust. You say your husband is easily influenced. This is something you have to voice to your husband. Make it clear exactly why you think he is so easily influenced.", "NTA - people who condone cheating are awful. Sounds like your husband was OK with his friends cheating. I don't think you should be telling him who to hang out with, but also I wouldn't want to be with someone who thinks cheating is ok. Sticky situation here.", "YTA. I was torn until I saw you calling this woman a whore.", "YTA \n\nYou can\u2019t forbid your grown husband of doing anything.", "This is a tough judgement, but if I have to issue one, I think the best I can do NAH (except your husband's BF).\n\nI wouldn't want to be associated even tangentially with the BF either. But your husband isn't responsible for his friend's behavior. Unfortunately, it's not that easy to drop a best friend.\n\nI'm also not keen on your repeated use of \"whore\". Some might see it as a grieving woman who was taken advantage of.\n\nYou say your hubby is \"easily manipulated\", so are you afraid he's going to do something similar to what his friend did under his influence? If so that speaks more to the state of your relationship.\n\nI don't like the fact that he's \"secretly\" hanging out with him, but he probably thinks that's the compromise position given your loyalty to the ex-wife. I think this is a job for a marriage counselor", "ESH\n\nHe's the \"friend,\" the grieving woman who made a terrible decision on the day she buried her boyfriend is the \"whore\"?", "ESh and obviously your husband isn't that easy to manipulate or he would've listened to you and stuck to it.  \nWhen someone shows you their true colors, listen to them. Who knows what he's doing with them behind your back because if he's willing to lie and omit to see that friend who is a shady shit, who knows what else he's doing.  \nBut same time? He's a grownass adult and makes his own choices, you just need to decide what you are okay with putting up with vs not and take your own actions accordingly.", "I don't blame you for your concerns, if he's associating with them still, he's supporting them. That's not good. But you need to have that conversation with him and really get that point across, that you don't trust him anymore because he has continued being friends with such people. If he still doesn't get it, maybe it's time to reexamine your relationship with him. I don't think I would be able to sleep peacefully at night knowing that my partner not only supports his cheating friend, but if he cheated on me, he would also have people to cover for him. You can't control who he can be friends with, but you can absolutely challenge his value system. Maybe do therapy with him to understand why he's giving a free pass over this and is he really okay with the ex wife and children being abandoned like this. I sincerely hope the ex wife moves on and finds someone else who will love her and the children unconditionally. You need to blame the friend too, not just the woman.", "YTA. You cannot control who your husband is friends with. You can disagree with what has happened, and of course you feel bad for your friend, but what\u2019s with repeatedly calling the single woman a whore? She didn\u2019t break up your husbands BF\u2019s family - he did that. \n\nYou need to take a step back and analyze your feelings, and also mind your own business.", "YTA. Did you ask or did you forbid? You\u2019re not his mom and he\u2019s an adult, so you can\u2019t forbid him from doing anything. You can tell him how you feel, but he has free will and can choose. You may not like his choices, but you also have your own.", "YTA - you can't control who your husband chooses to befriend. All you can do is ask for him not to, and explain why it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n>I have forbade my husband to stay clear of his cheating BF and his whore\n\nForbade? He's not your servant or child, he's your husband. While your reason for not wanting him to be associated with his best friend is valid. Recognize, that he's still a human being with the option to choose his friends.", "YTA this sounds very controlling and insecure. Don't you trust the man you chose to be your life partner? If you do, then you're way out of line. If you can't, then you have bigger problems. If someone gave me an ultimatum like that, I'd run a mile.", "you know your husband is with them and condons cheating. you can't make him be a good person with good values. \nnta, but it won't work. it never does", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don\u2019t trust your husband and feel like you\u2019re allowed to forbid him to do things this is well past repair. Gross", "N T A for feeling how you feel, but YTA for thinking you can tell him to be friends with. He's a grown man who will decide for himself who he wants to keep company with.\n\nBTW, I understand you feel strongly, but whores get paid...homewrecker is a much better choice of words, if you must. But this level of vitriol will make it impossible to communicate effectively with your husband. His friend was the cheater, and he's the problem. If it wasn't this woman, it would be another one.", "Tell him to stay tf away. If he can do that to his wife and former friend, they were probably already fxcking before the friend died. So how does he feel about that? Friends like that don\u2019t deserve friends cuz how do you know they wouldn\u2019t do the same to him?", "\"I have forbade my husband to steer clear\" says the opposite of what you mean--double negative. You either forbid him and/or told him to steer clear. If you forbid him to steer clear, you are saying you wanted him to stay in contact.", "DzftaDrrq", "YTA\n\nYou cannot forbid your husband to be friends with someone, that's controlling behaviour. And you say that your husband is easily manipulated, if you're having trust issues with your husband because he's friends with someone who's cheated - that's an issue between you and your husband, and has nothing to do with his friendship.\n\nAlso, calling the other woman a whore is extremely derogatory and misogynistic, and you should be ashamed for calling another woman that. Even more so when you're not name-calling your husbands friend but only her.", "This. If the new GF is \"whore\" there should be equally contemptuous language for him.", "That hit me too, also forbidding a grown ass man from seeing his bf is AH move, and if I understand this mess the dead friends wife is who the bf cheated with? It honestly sounds like this came out of grief for both, it doesn\u2019t excuse it , but may just need to run it\u2019s course Cheating isn\u2019t contagious either I feel bad for everyone involved, however your anger and judgement ( whore) helps no one", "Yep. They are both awful and should both get equal harsh judges.", "This", "Also if you \"forbid\" someone to \"stay clear\" of a person/people, you are forbidding them from not seeing someone (=double negative) which is essentially saying they must see that person....."]}
