{"id": 32310, "submission_id": "18ahsgb", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my stepdaughter live with us", "selftext": "I (28f) have been married to my husband, (42m) for 2 years, together for 4. He has 3 children from a previous marriage, Lucas (18m), Lily (16f) and Kayla (13f). While I do not dislike children, I don't want children of my own, and I made this very clear to him when we dated. This wasn't an issue because he only got his children for a weekend a month, because they live far away from us. I made it very clear that I didn't want to take care of his children, apart from the occasional weekend.\n\nFor the past 4 years I have tried my best to be a good stepmother, and have built a good relationship with my stepson Lucas and stepdaughter Kayla, but I am unable to build a relationship with Lily. I've tried to take her out for girls days, shopping sprees and fun outings. She either refuses to go or complains the whole time. The last straw was when I got her something from her wishlist last Christmas ( a  bracelet that she wanted), and she threw it away, saying that I got her the wrong one and I was too poor to understand the difference. She then accused me of only marrying her father for his money. I usually don't let her comments get to me, but this was the last straw. After this I stopped trying to interact with her and maintain my distance. \n\nThe truth is I didn't marry my husband for his money. We both work in high paying tech jobs but I inherited a lot from my parents. I even agreed to pay for part of Lucas' tuition. \n\nAnyways, Lily and Kayla want to move to a better school the next school year. The school is closer to our home than their mother's so my husband said that they should live with us. I don't mind living with Kayla, but I don't want to be around Lily. My husband goes to work 4 days a week while I work from home so I'll constantly have to be around Lily and I refuse to do that. I dont mind being around Kayla, but not Lily. I told my husband all this and he called me an ah, and we've been fighting ever since. He says i need to step up as a stepmother and I cant let a teenager hurt me. Lily has been in tears, saying it's not fair that I want Kayla but not her, and her mother is on her side. So am i the asshole\n\n**Edit: to all the people saying i signed up for this when i married a man with kids,  my husband led me to believe that he never wanted full custody of them, and if anything were to happen to their mother their aunt would get custody. He has never been close to his children and has said he regrets having them. On the weekends they were with us I spent more time with them. His reaction has me blindsided. I have suggested therapy and family therapy but my husband is very against therapy, so that is not an option. I have asked husband to talk to Lily but he doesn't want to get involved. If her behaviour changes, even a little, I have no problem letting her live with us, but the fact that husband and his ex refuse to talk to her about her behaviour and the fact that i need to be around her all day is terrifying to me.\nBoth of us come from a culture where it's normal to marry a man older and better settled, so our age gap didn't come as a shock to anyone. At the time of his first marriage he was 23 while his ex was 18\n\n**Edit 2: My husband leaves for work at 8 am and comes home at 8pm. The kids are in school from 8 am to 2 pm, so i have to parent them alone from 3ish to 8 and that is not something I want to do. When we got married I said I wouldn't take on any parenting responsibilities and I stand by it. He refuses to work from home like me or get home sooner.\n\n**Edit 3: I didn't tell Lily or Kayla any of this. I told my husband who told his ex who told the kids. This was meant to be an adult conversation. I know how this information could hurt Lily\n\n**Edit 4: For people saying i shouldn't have married a man with kids, i was led to believe by my family that he was the best I would get due to my age. Most women in my community are married by 21. We got to know each other and I fell in love with him, and he assured me he would support my career and i wouldn't have to take the typical role of a mother. I knew that if i didn't get married soon my family would isolate me. I was coerced by my family and lied to by my husband.\n\n**Edit 5: Some people are saying NTA, and some are saying YTA. It's quite obvious that those saying YTA don't know much about other cultures where honour killings and forced marriages exist. In my culture, and actually most cultured outside maybe the US and some European countries, children or teenagers dont get to say whatever they want because they're hormonal or whatever. In my culture men having multiple wives is common, men marrying young women are common, men marrying women their daughters age is also common. Most children my kids age have multiple mothers, and they know they must be respected. Learn something about other cultures before you say such harsh things.", "created_utc": 1701687378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ahsgb/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_stepdaughter_live/", "score": 2031, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are entitled to do what you want with your own body, so if you don't want to get pregnant and give birth, that is totally ok. But again, you went into this relationship knowing he has kids. You intentionally got married, knowing he has kids. Honestly, if I were the parent in this situation, the kids would come first before the spouse.\n\nEdit: reading your edits, it is more understandable why you married him in the first place. Given everything you've said, it sounds like you might benefit from some therapy, so that you can figure out what you want & whether you're able to reconcile your desires with balancing your family, your husband, and his kids. It would be totally understandable for you to divorce him, and would not make you an asshole. That being said, if you choose to stay in the relationship, you gotta accept the kids, in whatever frequency they come. The kids are part of the package. And picking favorites where you're chill with some kids but not others only makes that worse.\n\nEdit 2: I know you said a lot of the background reasons for why you ended up in this situation is because of familial pressure & you're worried about losing your family. Just putting this out there, it's not inherently a bad thing to lose your family. Especially when you potentially might have some trauma as a result of the way you were raised. Cutting off your family (even temporarily) does not make you an asshole.

He has 3 children from a previous marriage, Lucas (18m), Lily (16f) and Kayla (13f). While I do not dislike children, I don't want children of my own, and I made this very clear to him when we dated. This wasn't an issue because he only got his children for a weekend a month, because they live far away from us. I made it very clear that I didn't want to take care of his children, apart from the occasional weekend.\n\nFor the past 4 years I have tried my best to be a good stepmother, and have built a good relationship with my stepson Lucas and stepdaughter Kayla, but I am unable to build a relationship with Lily. I've tried to take her out for girls days, shopping sprees and fun outings. She either refuses to go or complains the whole time. The last straw was when I got her something from her wishlist last Christmas ( a  bracelet that she wanted), and she threw it away, saying that I got her the wrong one and I was too poor to understand the difference. She then accused me of only marrying her father for his money. I usually don't let her comments get to me, but this was the last straw. After this I stopped trying to interact with her and maintain my distance.\n\nThe truth is I didn't marry my husband for his money. We both work in high paying tech jobs but I inherited a lot from my parents. I even agreed to pay for part of Lucas' tuition. \n\nAnyways, Lily and Kayla want to move to a better school the next school year. The school is closer to our home than their mother's so my husband said that they should live with us. I don't mind living with Kayla, but I don't want to be around Lily. My husband goes to work 4 days a week while I work from home so I'll constantly have to be around Lily and I refuse to do that. I dont mind being around Kayla, but not Lily. I told my husband all this and he called me an ah, and we've been fighting ever since. He says i need to step up as a stepmother and I cant let a teenager hurt me. Lily has been in tears, saying it's not fair that I want Kayla but not her, and her mother is on her side. So am i the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Without reading the comments I sense there may be much ridicule.

We are just here to be moved by your story. So thank you for sharing \ud83c\udf81\n\nSince family dynamics tend to impact women\u2019s mental health much more harshly due to our historical roles, I would seek a personal counselor that reflects your values and ambitions if your financial situation allows or build towards this.  Everyone needs professional in their corner (doctors for physical health, lawyers for legal protection, financial advisors for a stable independent financial foundation) that is specifically hired to protect your interests. Especially your mental health as you are in the worst \u201cbehind the 8 ball\u201d position of \u2018not the mother of my children\u2019 which echoes from society feasting upon us to provide dependent services many times in an execution style of one\u2019s self identity*. Much like you would hire a lawyer to represent your interests in a court of law, you should have your own counselor that will protect your self identity which can become future mental health challenges - quickly I might add.\n\nIt seems the first question to reflect upon with (or without) counsel is your desire to continue in this relationship or divest. If you wish to fight for your marriage stability, a counselor may suggest blended family counseling.  This could be helpful to sooth scars caused up to now from all sides in this relationship with your spouse and the children.  It may also help to determine if the shared relationship has been fractured beyond repair or if smoother sailing can be fostered. It is important to note that should you wish to continue with this relationship, your spouse most humbly has the final say as you do with them in a vice versa way.  One thing for sure, you only control you! (thoughts, words, actions, reactions, choices & future) Your spouse could decide not to nurture this relationship now or at anytime in the future. Should they pass away unexpectedly, the relationships you build with his children may or may not provide you comfort in your end of life years. Statistically few relationships make it through trauma such as this until the parties are really both too far along in their life stage to start over. Both of you are still young in your life stage together given there are no grand babies or great grand babies yet from his children.\n\nAll of you should move forward with a solid supportive foundation be that together or apart. Just remember the relationship with yourself is the one to protect against all others.

Both paths can lead to suicide or the utter loss of self which is always a concern.

She is just a kid and a teenage girl at that and having lived through it myself i would wonder if the kid is ok.", "Good point. This should be a non-problem. I never even thought of that, even though that was my own teens!", "They very much likely have extra curricular a or sports to keep them busy but if they require being driven, you know the dad is expecting OP to be the one driving.", "That it does", "Could be, but I believe most of these religious cultures frown on divorce unless there is infidelity or infertility(which clearly was not the case). The infertility not being the case that is. We have no clue on infidelity on either part. \n\nSince this culture allows for multiple wives,  I believe he would be more apt to just marry another woman while keeping the old one.", "Ha! I will say this is the strangest culture with some serious loopholes in it and allowances, but only sometimes, and never in OPs favor.", "Yeah, I always wished people would have to take some kind of test before they have kids! Lol", "Probably most, at this point.", "Your family sounds awfully backwards, to be honest. Stop listening to them. (I know, easier said than done).\n\nI am sorry that you have been pushed towards marriage like this.", "I have a question. Were you not put off by a man who has three children, but no interest in being a real dad to them? I get that you were clear that you don\u2019t want kids. But your husband had THREE kids and then decided he doesn\u2019t want to be a dad to them. \n\nHonestly, I think ESH. You were fine marrying a man who basically said he\u2019d abandon his kids if something happened to their mother. I\u2019m not sure what you expected from someone like that.", "No, no, I agree with everything you said. \n\nBut it's also very easy for women to just accept, I'd say.. weaponized incompetence \n\nI've seen a lot of women(very close to me) with stepfathers \n\nAnd bios who just had nothing to do with them, because their mom moved away, or they lived 5 hours away. \n\nNeither is a good excuse. \n\nI know it hurt one of my step sisters alot, she saw my bio drive 2 hours at least every other weekend to pick me up.", "You\u2019re acting as if OP doesn\u2019t have a high paying job, she\u2019s not oppressed and truly trapped like some are truly trapped. OP has enough privilege to leave her current situation family and all. You\u2019re acting as if she doesn\u2019t have a choice to stay in this marriage, but she does. She chose to enter it, she\u2019s choosing to stay in it, a marriage to a man with three kids. Cultural pressure as an excuse can only go so far when you actually are an autonomous adult with money.", "True but the husband doesn\u2019t seem to spend time with his kids as OP states. Not a lot of info is given but given that the kids don\u2019t see their dad often, they prob don\u2019t have much of a relationship, which is on the dad imo", "Right honour killings and forced marriages etc but she\u2019s allowed to defy her husband by refusing to let the daughter live with them?", "OP said she's part of a culture where honor killings and arranged marriages are common. I feel like the rubric probably looks a little different than it would for standard American/Canadian/western European marriages. I don't even know what the calculus around leaving/divorcing/renegotiating the expectations and boundaries of the marriage look like if \"my dad and uncles might murder me if I dishonor the family by leaving this shitty marriage\"", "100%. OP, you weren't blindsided by this because you knowingly married a bad person", "And the ex wife can defy him? And the daughters? And divorce is ok along with multiple wives?  Sex out of wedlock is ok? Celebrates Christmas but is Muslim? So, so many holes, but ah well, if we didn't take stuff at face value on this forum, it wouldn't be half as fun. \n\nThis is probably Liz up to her usual shenanigans to be honest."]}
