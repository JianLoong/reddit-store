It ruins every Christmas and I'm fed up of it, I don't mind him drinking just not as much as he does normally.

Your brother is WAY out of line and might have an addiction.", "NTA. But it doesn\u2019t sound like your brother will be willing to not drink during Christmas as, sadly, he may be addicted to alcohol already.", "NTA \n\nYour brother is going through a really hard time and using alcohol as a coping method. I honestly suggest that on a day outside the holidays, when he feels less stress and depression (the holidays are known for aggravating depression) you and your family sit down with him when he\u2019s sober and suggest therapy. But no, definitely NTA. You\u2019re just looking out for him and wanting what\u2019s best for him and the rest of your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like your brother has used alcohol to cope for years, and then he takes his anger out on you and your siblings. It isn\u2019t fair that you can\u2019t feel safe in your home on Christmas. He needs to make an effort to not drink so he doesn\u2019t verbally abuse kids.\n\nIf you have a trusted adult in your life, I\u2019d advise you to have that person present when you ask your brother. And I\u2019d also make plans to stay elsewhere for the holiday, in the event your brother decides to get drunk anyway.", "You\u2019re not the asshole, but trying to tell someone what to do isn\u2019t the right approach. People don\u2019t respond well to being bossed around, especially a younger sibling. He won\u2019t listen to you, and it will likely cause a bigger issue if you press it. The better approach would be to talk to your mom, and have her talk to him. If the goal is to get it him to not do it, that would be a better approach", "NTA.
