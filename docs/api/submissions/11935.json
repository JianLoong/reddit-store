His mom and mom's side of the family welcomed me with open arms. His dad, step mom, and brothers have pretty much ignored my existence. We live overseas and I used to message them years ago trying to get to know them and they'd either leave me on read or give one word answers so I stopped. My husband asked why they don't want to get to know me and they say the phone works both ways. Which just means that since I stopped reaching out they don't reach out at all. I haven't conversed with that side of the family in over 5 years. Me and my husband have no idea why they are like this with me but have accepted their other DIL with open arms. It isn't a race issue as we're all the same race. It has impacted his relationship with them but they say it's my fault for him pulling away from them.\n\nA few months ago I posted on social media a picture of me and his mom telling her that I love her. His brother got mad and messaged him saying I was a POS for being close to his mom after what she did to their dad during the divorce. My husband is 30 and asked what his mom did and his brother told him it was none of his business. So my husband told him that he doesn't care and loves his mom and I love his mom so we will continue to visit and love her.\n\nFast forward to last week my husband had surgery. I called his mom and gave her updates but made a group chat on social media with his dad's side giving them updates. They were upset because they felt like they deserved a phone call and I don't even have their phone numbers. I said in the group chat that they're lucky I even updated them and left the chat. They then started blowing up my husband's phone during his surgery about how rude I am. He blocked them and his brother said that once again I'm acting like their mom and I'm a POS.\n\nAITA for not calling his family individually during his surgery?", "created_utc": 1678436211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nj4o3/aita_for_texting_my_husbands_family_instead_of/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are hostile towards you and you live in a different country.

If you don't have some of the #s then it's obviously impossible to call everyone.  And you're right about communicating with them at all after how they treated you in the past.  You were courteous enough to keep them in the loop regarding your husband's health situation.   That js not the time for anyone to have started drama- someone going into, or who is in surgery doesn't need to wake up to that Bs like your husband did.   I hope he's OK,  and os recovering well.  Good luck OP", "NTA", "NTA - Texting was fine but it seems the group social media is what blew up. As u/SPolowiski said, keep these folks at a distance; especially when your focus is on your husband's health and healing. \n\nContinue to love who love you and keep strong communication with your husband. It is sad an entire side of the family is unable to build a bridge; get past their egos. Best to you.", "Just drop them. Go NC. It's not worth it.", "NTA and it sounds like a family you want to keep at some distance. Also you may want to tone down on what you post on social media, which seems to cause more problems than what it solves in todays world.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What kind of convoluted logic is that? (Personal guess? FIL tried to screw over MIL in the divorce, but she ended up with a fair share & FIL has been harping on it to the brothers for years. How hubby stayed out of it is a mystery.) INFO: Are all of his brothers older? How long have MIL & FIL been divorced? Do these people avoid texting & still prefer actually talking on the phone? That was me, up until about 10-12 years ago, but now I hardly ever want to talk on the phone. Text is way easier & more versatile. If they still haven't, as a group, adopted texting, they may have been peeved you wouldn't call. Still assholes for that, but more likely they're just assholes in general.
