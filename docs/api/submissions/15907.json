Our daughter (9) was devastated as she considered this quiet, old cat \"hers,\" as my ex and I each had our own dog at the time.\n\nTwo months later, my daughter and I moved out of the family home and several states away. I figured a low-key pet of her own, another cat, would help her through the transition of her parents splitting up, moving away, starting at a new school, etc.\n\nIn my search for a new cat or kitten, I had seen two kittens that I loved (because you can't get just one kitten). By the time I was able to get to the adoption center, one of the kittens had already been adopted, so I was resigned to getting just the one. My daughter and I went to the adoption event where she got to hold the male kitten I was interested in. It being a busy Saturday in a Petsmart with a dozen puppies in cages also for adoption, the kitten was none to pleased, so he hissed at my daughter. She immediately was no longer interested in this male kitten, but I was determined to get him. There was a female kitten (sister to the male I wanted) that rubbed herself along the side of the crate and was purring loudly as my daughter placed her hand there. So, we ended up walking out with two kittens (cause you can't get just one!)\n\nWe've now had the cats almost two years. The male is undeniable moreso \"my\" cat, while the female loves my daughter. This cat sleeps with her at night, and in general just hangs out with her a lot more. In therapy, my daughter says that this cat (and the dog she ended up getting post-divorce) really help her feel happy when she is sad. This issue is, that for the past 8 months or so, my daughter's cat will not use the litter box to poop in instead preferring to defecate on the floor right next to the litter box.\n\nAt first, I moved a litter box to the area she was pooping (in the kitchenette). When that didn't solve the issue, I placed both litter boxes there. When that didn't solve the issue, I switched from pellet litter to Skoon (a pebble type litter). She didn't take to the litter change, so I tried Skoon's fine grain. Nope. I've changed litter two more times. Still not pooping in the litter box. Mind you, she has always used the box, no matter the litter type to urinate. My last resort has been to tape down aluminum foil to cover the ground where she generally poops.\n\nI am sick and tired of cleaning the floor every day, only for it to be shat on again in a few hours. It's absolutely disgusting and embarrassing. I told my daughter that I am no longer cleaning up after her cat, and that if she doesn't stay on top of cleaning it up, the cat is going to have to go. I am at my wits end...\n\nSo, WIBTA if I gave her cat away?", "created_utc": 1682683891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131pwuk/wibta_if_i_gave_away_my_daughters_cat/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Pooping outside of the litter box can be a sign of a health issue, especially when the cat hasn't done that often in the past.   \n   \nEdit to add: and especially when the cat is only 2 years old! This is not normal and sending the cat away from the only home she's known is not the answer.", "YTA, have you tried a vet. You know the place you should have started.", "YTA. Add another box, go to a vet, consult a behaviorist. Research! There are tons of possible solutions out there! Everything from special boxes to simply adding another box to adding a box just lined with paper, etc.", "YTA. This cat needs to go to the vet. They don't just start messing outside the litter box, especially if it's kept clean, for no reason. Why have you not taken this poor cat to get seen?", "YTA. This would likely be a health issue, as the cat doesn't sound old enough to be doing it out of spite--but if something changed in the last few months to start stressing the cat out enough to do this out of spite, start there to get the car to stop retaliating. Otherwise, go to the vet.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA\n\nI don't get this \"you can't get just one kitten\" talk, especially if you're just going to give one away. Also getting rid of the cat your daughter has grown attached to after 2 years is just sh!tty to your daughterand the cat.\n\nHave you taken the cat to the vet?", "YTA. Cat is actually keeping clean. She poops next to litter tray so figure out what is wrong with tray - you've tried a lot of things but she still has an issue. We ended up with a pet who'd only poop after a scare in concealed place - under coffee table with front paws resting on beam. She was very clean - woke you to be escorted to her poop place. Another wouldn't poop where another did. Recommendation as cat poop is horrible to handle is try an utility tray and tape down puppy pads to it.\n\nBut cat is your daughter's pet, bonded to her. How would your daughter and your cat feel if you gave away their friend and kept your cat? Your daughter was emotionally badly affected when her cat died. How much pain and anger directed at you if you gave away her friend, her confidant, her bed companion? It  could wreck relationship with her. But she is old enough to help, not take full responsibility, with looking after her cat.\n\nEdit:also as well as vet, talk to a good no-kill cat rescue. Most will do advice as well and an experienced rescuer has faced most issues. If got from one, most rescues offer lifelong support. And assuming both are neutered. If not, then that might help. Cats are territorial and she may be uncomfortable pooping in brother's spot.", "YTA. You haven't even taken the cat to the vet yet to see if there is a problem.\n\nYou're arguing with literally DOZENS of people in the comments about whether a vet is necessary.\n\nI rescue cats and we ***hate*** owners like you.

Asap I might add.\nThis is not normal behaviour at all.\n\nYWBTA", "YWBTA\n\nAt minimum, talk to your vet and see what guidance you can get on the issue. It would be cruel to remove a cat from its home and to take your daughter's pet away because of this, even if it continued to do it. Your daughter is too young to reliably clean up right away every time this happens.\n\nIn the meantime, puppy pads might be helpful in feeling less ick when you clean it (you can just throw them away, no real cleaning involved).", "YWBTA   \nLargly because you keep arguing with everyone who tells you to get a medical workup.  You're clearly refusing to try all avenues, you're not looking for a **cause** you're only looking at solutions and you are refusing to provide vet care for your cat because you, a person with no vet med knowledge, decided the cat can't possibly be sick since it doesn't look sick. You're being negligent.\n\n**Unexplained changes in behavior are a medical concern, ESPECIALLY when they start suddenly.**\n\ngiven your aversion to the vet, I feel inclined to ask, have you EVER taken them to a vet? Are they up to date on vaccines? were they dewormed as kittens? (all kittens have worms)\n\n\\*\\*medical things to consider:\\*\\*  \n\n\n***is she declawed?*** declawing can lead to permanent joint pain which can deter them from wanting to dig in the litter box.\n\n***arthritis*** that makes her not want to dig.\n\n***GI problems:*** IBD, cancer, masses, parasite infection or something else causing her pain making her want to hold it as long as possible, OR affecting her ability to CONTROL it. aka incontinence.\n\nMedical issues can be confirmed or denied with a simple exam and basic blood work. No excuse to not get that done. Cats will pretty much naturally use a litter box so if they aren't SOMETHING IS WRONG.\n\nIf physical problems are ruled out your vet can guide you on dealing with psychological ones. and work with you specifically with your situation to give you the best advice based on you specifically, not general dr google solutions.", "YTA\n\nAll the noise about your daughter doesn't matter.\n\nYou adopted a pet and failed to housetrain it.  Now you want to dump it on someone else or have it murdered.", "If a cat starts doing this consistently then there may be an underlying health issue", "Have you taken the cat to the vet!? This is often the sign of a medical problem so that's the first avenue to explore.\n\nIf the cat is healthy, is she stressed for some reason? Are there cats outside your house that may be making her feel threatened?\n\nIs someone cleaning the litterbox a couple times a day, and changing the litter and washing the box at least every few days? \n\nI'm assuming the cat is not declawed, which can cause all sorts of litterbox problems due to pain.\n\nFinally, how many litter boxes do you have? If you have two cats, you need at least three litter boxes. Put them in different places.\n\nAnd yes, YTA if you dump this poor cat instead of figuring out what the problem is", "YWBTA. I suggest figuring out the poop patern", "YWBTA.  And cruel as well.\n\nI had a cat that started pooping outside her box. Peed in the box, but pooped near it - not in it.  I took her to the vet who determined that the special food she was on (different medical issue) was causing her to be constipated, so pooping hurt.  Cat brain says \"it hurts when I poop here\" so cat brain says \"don't poop there!\".\n\nGet the cat to the vet  - there's a medical issue going on.", "Ok so several options at play here. Sounds like your cat likely has a medical issue going on. Are they allowed outside the house at all? Could be a stomach parasite so you should definitely take her to the vet to get checked out. Since you have two cats another option is territory marking. She could be trying to assert dominance over your other cat. I see this as either being behavioral or medical. \n\nYTA if you just get rid of the cat without taking it to the vet. I see you dodging comments suggesting you do so and I\u2019m not sure why\u2026. You shouldn\u2019t have gotten two cats if you are unwilling to provide the necessary care for them which includes paying for them to go the vet when needed. \n\nIMO your child will resent you for doing something cruel like getting rid of their pet that you are less boded to out of convenience for you. Pretty sad tbh.", "so yes YBTA***\n\ni mean i\u2019d think to take the cat to the vet no? it seems like a health issue tbh. i\u2019d suggest to do that first before making any big decisions.", "YWBTA if you gave away your daughter\u2019s pet. Not only does she love her cat, but she even told her therapist her cat helps her feel happy. \n\nWhen you get a pet, that\u2019s a commitment. It\u2019s one thing if you are a situation where you cannot afford a pet or have lost housing but that\u2019s not the case here. \n\nit\u2019s your responsibility to try every single option.\n\nYour first step should be a trip to the vet, a lot of things can cause cats to do this including illness. Cats rarely show signs of illness or pain, so you might not see other signs of illness. If you\u2019re low on funds, you can Google low cost vet in your area. \n\nYou should also try: \n\n-Putting litter boxes in multiple rooms. One in your daughter\u2019s room, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, etc. (you should always have one more litter box than the amount of cats you have, so if you have 2 cats you should have 3 litter boxes). The reason you are putting them in multiple rooms is that cats are territorial about their litter boxes even if they don\u2019t seem to be. \n\n-Making sure the litter box isn\u2019t near her food and water.\n\n-Scooping the litter boxes daily. Make sure you aren\u2019t using scented litter.\n\n-If you\u2019re not feeding them wet food, add a wet food to their diet, constipation can cause going to the restroom outside of the box.", "YTA. If you were smart, you\u2019d talk to a vet", ">This issue is, that for the past 8 months or so, my daughter's cat will not use the litter box to poop in instead preferring to defecate on the floor right next to the litter box.\n\nWhat the vet say? Because you asked a vet, right? Every behavioral change in an animal has a cause, they don't act randomly. So if she used the litter box before and now she doesn't, there's a reason.\n\nAluminum foil around the litter box probably makes it worse, as cats don't like the feel and sound of aluminum under their paws. Better to use disposable pet mats.\n\nFinally, your daugther is old enough to be responsible and take care of the cat. Have you taught her that over the years?", "We have a cat that does this. We just have a couple of basic trays, nothing fancy enclosed or anything. 9/10 times her poop ends up on the floor. She doesn\u2019t squat down low enough (like the other 2 cats we have) but she also gets ready by backing up until her legs hit the end of the tray and poops over the edge. Frustrating but we deal with it. Newspaper or paper towel surrounding the trays and we dispose of it easily enough. Try a different tray that the cat might like better. If it already uses the tray for wee, you know it\u2019s not the litter that\u2019s the issue. Now your daughter is 9, that\u2019s also old enough to teach chores and share the responsibility of pet parenting. \n\nYWBTA if you get rid of the cat. Especially 2 years down the road and she\u2019s so attached. You\u2019re inviting in more trauma for her and she would never forgive you if/when (because things ALWAYS come out) she found out.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t try a vet visit.\n\nI get it - I\u2019ve had a cat who misses the box and it\u2019s awful. (It was urine in that case, and we worked really hard with the vet on litter and meds and management, which did help.)\n\nHave you tried Dr Elsey\u2019s Cat Attract litter? The cat may also be constipated or something else that makes pooping uncomfortable and she may be associating that discomfort with the box. She needs to see a vet and you need to try to work on this before you consider surrendering her.", "YTA.\nFor even considering getting rid of your daughters cat. My mother did this to me, I hated her for it. \n\nTake the cat to a vet and seek answers, don't just dump an animal because it's too much work.\n\nGet creative with litter boxes, maybe get a large appliance tray and use it as a litter area.", "YTA for posting here instead of seeing a vet.", "I've seen other comments suggest you go to a vet with the cat first and agree!  In my experience with cats they do this type of behaviour to signal something is either wrong or not to their liking and since you have tried changing litter i think it might be health related. Or have you noticed any issues between her and the male cat? sometimes its also territorial based. Please consider these options and YWNBTA", "YTA. As others noted, see a vet. Also, I've seen the formula of one per cat *plus one*, so you should have **three litter boxes** around the house.", "YTA. Vets exist for a reason - if something is going on with the cat, take them there first.", "YTA. Have you tried different litters or cat boxes? Maybe a second box. Is your new home extra small or crowded. We had an extra guest. The dogs and cats went off the deep end till the left.", "YWBTA\n\nFirst thing, please take her to a vet immediately and get her checked. She might have a health issue causing pain when using the litterbox. The box then gets associated with pain and avoided. She clearly tries to be clean as she still stays in the area.\n\nDo you have 2 litter boxes? For multiple cats it is recommended to have the same number of litterboxes +1.\nDespite being spayed at 2 years the cats are becoming more mature so it might be a territorial issue with the tomcat.\n\nHow often are the litterboxes cleaned? I'd recommend daily, some cats refuse dirty boxes. I know it's a pain in the neck - the self sifting versions, manually or automatically can cut down on work.\n\nYou would hurt your child and do wrong by the animal. Pets are a life commitment, not a toy to be discarded when they become inconvenient. Try vet, retraining and improving the litter accomodations first.\nI know how horrid it is to have an unclean pet - my tomcat had recurring urinary stones and avoided the litter box for that reason. It caused considerable damage and we certainly cursed quite a bit from frustration before we managed to work out solutions.\nWe managed by restricting access to the house to a cat safe room, covering the couch with bed wetting pads covered by a easy to wash couch cover and generally keeping damageable things out of reach.

By the time I was able to get to the adoption center, one of the kittens had already been adopted, so I was resigned to getting just the one. My daughter and I went to the adoption event where she got to hold the male kitten I was interested in. It being a busy Saturday in a Petsmart with a dozen puppies in cages also for adoption, the kitten was none to pleased, so he hissed at my daughter. She immediately was no longer interested in this male kitten, but I was determined to get him. There was a female kitten (sister to the male I wanted) that rubbed herself along the side of the crate and was purring loudly as my daughter placed her hand there. So, we ended up walking out with two kittens (cause you can't get just one!)\n\nWe've now had the cats almost two years. The male is undeniable moreso \"my\" cat, while the female loves my daughter. This cat sleeps with her at night, and in general just hangs out with her a lot more. In therapy, my daughter says that this cat (and the dog she ended up getting post-divorce) really help her feel happy when she is sad. This issue is, that for the past 8 months or so, my daughter's cat will not use the litter box to poop in instead preferring to defecate on the floor right next to the litter box.\n\nAt first, I moved a litter box to the area she was pooping (in the kitchenette). When that didn't solve the issue, I placed both litter boxes there. When that didn't solve the issue, I switched from pellet litter to Skoon (a pebble type litter). She didn't take to the litter change, so I tried Skoon's fine grain. Nope. I've changed litter two more times. Still not pooping in the litter box. Mind you, she has always used the box, no matter the litter type to urinate. My last resort has been to tape down aluminum foil to cover the ground where she generally poops.\n\nI am sick and tired of cleaning the floor every day, only for it to be shat on again in a few hours. It's absolutely disgusting and embarrassing. I told my daughter that I am no longer cleaning up after her cat, and that if she doesn't stay on top of cleaning it up, the cat is going to have to go. I am at my wits end...\n\nSo, WIBTA if I gave her cat away?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
