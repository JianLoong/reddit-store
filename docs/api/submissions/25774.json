You decided to invite more people than you could hold/pay for an uninvited him after the fact which is unbelievably rude.

Now you\u2019re saying the wedding is full, like huh? Why didn\u2019t you follow up with him before completing your wedding plans? He\u2019s the ONE guest you have invited and has cancer, you didn\u2019t forget, you simply didn\u2019t care.

Not only dumping your friend from your wedding but comparing going through chemo to wedding planning?  Good God. Are you for real?", "YTA  \nMainly because you claim this is a good friend, then you NEVER followed up with him about whether he could come or not. Instead you waited until he said something and tell him the wedding was full. If he was a good friend, you could have held a place. How much is one more plate honestly?

Incredibly bizarre and unfeeling to put any of this on someone going through chemo.", "YTA. Yeah, because holding a seat/meal for one single person is just sooooooooooooooooo freaking hard.", "Yta.  I have other words to describe you but this sub is too sensitive.  Be a better friend.", "YTA, without a doubt. \n\nYour friend communicated that they\u2019d do everything in their power to be there and you agreed to communicate about attendance once it got closer.

What a horrid insensitive and all around shitty thing to do. A to think your wedding compares in any way to having fucking chemo. Fuck. Wow.", "Ah, the age-old question of balancing personal events with the unpredictable nature of life. Here's my take:\n\n1. **Reality Check**: Weddings are logistical nightmares. They require planning, money, and coordination. Holding a spot indefinitely, especially when you're not sure if someone can attend, is a tough call.\n\n2. **Empathy**: Your friend is going through a lot. Chemo is brutal, and the uncertainty of how he'll feel on any given day is a heavy burden. His desire to be there for your big day, despite his health challenges, speaks volumes about his feelings for you.\n\n3. **Communication**: It might have been helpful to give him a heads-up earlier that spots were filling up, or to set a soft deadline for his RSVP. This way, he wouldn't have been blindsided by the news.\n\n4. **Alternative Solutions**: Maybe there's a way to include him without him physically being there. A video call during the ceremony or a special message from him could be a way to make him feel included.\n\n5. **Guilt**: It's natural to feel guilty, especially when dealing with someone who's going through a tough time. But remember, you had to make a decision based on the information you had at the time.\n\nAre you the asshole? It's a gray area. Could things have been handled better? Probably. But life is messy, and sometimes there's no perfect solution. The best you can do now is reach out, apologize, and find a way to make it right.

He has an invitation so how could it be full?\n\nIf you are implying that you sent out XXX invitation and expected only XX to reserve, then you are the AH beyond AHs.  \n\nYou need to work hard to apologize to your friend and make sure he not only has a spot, but a special one at that.", "YTA. \n\nYou invited him, then uninvited him. Weddings are stressful to plan, yes, but it wouldn\u2019t have been hard to save him a spot. It seems like you just wanted to save money and didn\u2019t think his possible presence was that important to you.", "YTA I got married 40 years ago. I had a July wedding and started planning in January. My favorite cousin, who is closer than my sister, was in the hospital. She's a few years younger than me, and she was in having part of her lung removed. She had an immune disorder that started after a bout of shingles at 8 years old. A cold turned into pneumonia every time. \nI wanted her as a bridesmaid, but she told me she didn't want me to plan for that since her health at the time was always so iffy. So I told her we'll plan for her to man the register table, I had a bridesmaids dress for her, and we'll hope for good things. \nShe was healthy at the time of my wedding and able to participate with us. No way in hell would I have told her, well, since you'll probably be sick, just plan not to come.", "YTA. One extra plate and seat at your wedding was not going to break you. Your friend tried to keep you updated and at no time did you tell him you had to know by a certain date. You made it sound like you would welcome him no matter what, but that was untrue. And a gentle reminder, wedding planning is in no way similar to chemo. I can't believe you actually wrote that. You deserve a separate YTA for even thinking that.", "YTA. This person you call a friend is battling for his life and you decide your wedding is full and cut him out of it. Oooh, Lordy you\u2019re going straight to hell. You are a horrible thoughtless person. You owe him a huge apology.", "YTA. You agreed to reserve him a spot. You took a reservation. Then you didn\u2019t HOLD the reservation. And that\u2019s the most important part. The HOLDING. ANYBODY can just take \u2018em.", "YTA - seems you could have held 1 spot for him knowing everything he is going through", "What a shitty thing to do.  YTA", "YTA. And there's always no shows at weddings...your friend can easily be accommodated.", "YTA. I would have paid for the plate and donated the food if he did not show up. People undergoing cancer treatment need people to support them emotionally.", "YTA. The point at which you decided you wouldn\u2019t have space for him, you should have talked to him about it. But honestly I know weddings are expensive but I would have just held the spot. You wrote him off for being sick.", "YTA. Even if you lost what you would have paid for his meal if he didn\u2019t show, you should have left a spot open for him. He wasn\u2019t being wishy washy, he\u2019s going through chemo.", "I\u2019m sorry, YTA. It\u2019s one spot \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA\n\nYou're basically trading a friend for *potentially* some money saved and an empty chair.", "What an AH!\n\nYTA", "Wow. Why did you invite someone to your wedding about whom you care so little?\n\nAnd you claim you're getting chemo for colon cancer. I would think you would be more sympathetic. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You just compared chemo, particularly intense chemo, to planning a party. Gross.", "INFO: Do you usually kick people when they\u2019re down or is this new awful behavior? Of course YTA and the fact that you even have to ask proves it.", "Info: does your venue not allow you to add people? In my experience last minute changes are possible", "Karma is a messy boomerang. You\u2019re selfish.", "NAH. \n\nHis situation is difficult and sad but you have deadlines to follow. He did not RSVP on time and he actuslly does have the capability of deciding based on his current experience if he thought he would be up for going or not. Is it necessarily the same experience he might actually feel day of? Maybe not. But it is the info he has to work from. \n\nPeople who don't RSVP are a \"not coming\" and therefore don't get a meal that cannot be refunded for them to just not show up. Even during this conversation he wasn't planning on actually RSVPing. The appropriate thing for him to have done was to have declined instead of stringing you along. Being sick doesn't mean you get to be rude either. And yes I get that he has an extenuating circumstance but he has also had months to think about it. His world is absolutely revolving around his illness. But yours is not required to revolve around it. You offering to wait does not mean you are willing to wait past the final cut off for the venue or until the day of the wedding. It means waiting past your invite's stated RSVP date which is usually a month before the real cut off.\n\nIf he feels well he can go to the ceremony and to the dance after dinner.\n\nI do find the phrasing that your \"wedding is full\" really weird though. What is that supposed to mean? You are at capacity for fire code?\n\nI think one of the toughest things about this will be how you are going to feel about your response if he doesn't come through.", "YTA... you literally told him you would both touch base as the wedding guy closer. That means you hold good space until you talk again later and see how he feels. You didn't, you are very much wrong. It would've cost you one plate of food to show some kindness and hold a place even if he bailed 3 the night before. He's going thru chemo ffs. Id be surprised if he's still your friend.", "YTA- an easy way to support your friend would have been to save him a spot at your wedding.", "If he\u2019s a \u201cgood friend\u201d YTA", "YTA. Just pay for the extra spot. Wth they\u2019re going through chemo. \u201cMy wedding is full without you\u201d is what you told them.", "YTA - when you send out invitations you should have a potential seat for everyone that gets an invite.", "Yta he's been communicating with you. How hard is it to make sure you you have space for one person and order one more meal as a just in case", "YTA, are you sure you\u2019re friends? I don\u2019t understand why wouldn\u2019t you want to be more accommodating for a friend?", "YTA\n\nYou invited him. He very considerately didn't just RSVP yes, forcing you to hold a spot for him. He asked you for time, and you lied to him and told him you would give him time. And when he contacted you to tell you that he was still hoping he could come, you told him about your lie and that you never held a spot for him and that you really didn't give a shit about him. So well done, you screwed over your friend struggling through cancer. I really hope you never have to deal with anyone else going through cancer, because you suck as a friend, and anyone who has to deal with it deserves better than you.", "YTA. This is so out of his control, he\u2019s sick and he\u2019s still trying to make it to your wedding. He doesn\u2019t want to attend for himself, he wants to attend for you. And you basically uninvited him.", "YTA", "I\u2019ll make your story real short: Your friend is going through chemo and taking things day by day, which you agreed to support and invited him to your wedding. Obviously not going well if he needs stronger chemo and was being honest and communicating that he might not be able to attend  (you agreed to these terms). You took that as him not committing to coming to your wedding so you essentially rescinded his invite? He probably was going to try so hard to attend because he wanted to be their FOR YOU on your special day but you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to save him a seat at a table and pay for a plate for him is what I\u2019m hearing? YTA. \n\nP.S. if you gave people attending +1s, you\u2019re an extra asshole for having \u201cenough space\u201d legit strangers over your friend with cancer.", "Yta and he no longer considers you a good friend.", "YTA . And massively.  It\u2019s the cost of one guest.  You put him down as a yes and if at the last minute he had to back out then so be it.  You are not a friend. \n\nEdit to add. \u201cI know it\u2019s it\u2019s been a rough year for him with his chemo, but weddings are hard to plan too\u201d.  Almost missed this little gem at the end.  As someone who has both planned a wedding and been through chemo I cannot even begin to tell you how much you suck for uttering this sentence.", "YTA. You think planning your wedding is harder than chemo? Maybe you should try chemo,then.", "Yta you can squeeze in ONE person more. \nYou said you'd hold a spot and then didn't. This person I'd literally fighting for thier life tooth n nail. And you can't hold a single spot?", "Gross. \n\nYTA and a bad friend.", "YTA, and you are not good friend material if your wedding was so stressful you couldn\u2019t you know, keep your word and save ONE space for a friend undergoing chemo? So stressful for you!", "Are you actually the friend and writing from the view point of the groom?\nAre you suddenly cured and getting married?\nI would think someone undergoing chemo themselves would be more understanding.", "Um, ask your future self, the one that went to his funeral, and ask her.", "Massive AH, this is probably the one situation you make extra arrangements to fit in if they are able to attend", "YTA, sorry to say. Your friend is sick. He needs uplifting. Who cares if you need one extra seat??", "Suddenly deeply appreciative that no one jerked me around like this during my daughter's chemo.\n\nYour friend told you he was coming to your wedding unless he had health complications from treatment for a deadly illness, and you told him \"no you aren't invited\".  YTA.  \n\nThe only bone I can throw is that maybe you are just thoughtless and have no idea how chemo works.", "He was invited and suddenly the wedding was \"full\"? Yeah I'm not buying it. YTA", "YTA SO MUCH YTA.\n\nHe's not being difficult he has CANCER.", "Damn I\u2019d have put him has a yes and invited a rando day of if he could not. This was super douchey of you and you\u2019re def the asshole here. \n\nImagine being in a shitty place in life, being invited to an event that makes you feel good, safe, happy. When you follow back, the person acts like you\u2019re no longer invited and you go from happiness to dejection when you need it least.", "YTA without a doubt. I hope you never have to find out what it\u2019s like for your friend. Honestly, you should be ashamed of yourself. Please try to find a way to make it up to him. I have no idea how you can do this, but try. I am absolutely certain that fighting for one\u2019s life is more difficult than ordering flowers and trying on gowns. Time to grow up and make this right.", "[removed]", "YTA, I'm (36f) in radiation now but was having chemo. It sucked, how you can compare wedding planning to cancer is mindblowing...\n\nIt's not much effort to save a spot for someone who I assume is a young adult with cancer (under 40). Cancer sucks at any age but when you're a YAACER it's even more isolating, marriage, kids all those milestones paused or even...taken away. You've impacted him more than you understand. \n\nHe's gone silent because when you get a life changing diagnosis you take stock of what's worth the effort. You've likely deeply hurt him . I hope you can apologize and move forward thoughtfully.", "For the price of a meal you\u2019ve shat on your not really a friend. Too bad.", "YTA!! You wrote off your friend, who isn\u2019t dead, but is probably thinking about that possibility every day while enduring chemo. Sounds like your friend really hoped to attend. It is mortifying that you did this to someone battling cancer.", "YTA.\n\nI just can't with people like you. \n\nYeah a spot at dinner would have cost you and it may have gone to waste on the day itself, but I'd rather sink the money on a plate and potentially have my friend there.\n\nYour saying you didn't even bother to text and call him to see how he is doing? How he is feeling with the new regime? He still found the time to text you.\n\nA wedding is just a big party. There might be more parts involved but that's what it is at the end of the day, and not more stressful than going through and trying to organise your life around something that wants to try and kill you.", "Yes. You are the asshole.", "Massive YTA", "You find out who your friends are when the shit hits the fan in your life. Your friend has found out you\u2019re not one of his. YTA.", "So you said it's ok for him to tell you later if he can come or not, but then decided he won't come so it's ok to not keep him a spot? Yeah YTA.", "Oh of course YTA. You told him you\u2019d hold a space for him while he was going through hell and you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s as simple as that. \n\nNo doubt people will tell you it\u2019s your wedding, invite / don\u2019t invite who you want, etc. And that may be true, but in this specific case you\u2019re being a self-centred asshole.", "YTA. You agreed with his plan to let you know as you got closer to the wedding, then you just went and finalized the wedding without even following up. Like, did you even reach out before finalizing to ask if he knew whether he\u2019d be able to attend yet? Even if he still didn\u2019t know at that point, you should\u2019ve just given him a spot, and if he ended up not being able to attend, no big deal. Your behavior screams indifference.", "Maybe if there was like a set date you needed to know by but really did the one or two extra seats kill the wedding or budget? People rsvp yes and dont show up all the time and life goes on. You could have sucked it up regardless... needless to say I think the friendship is over.", "Fuck is wrong with people man lol. \u201cAm I the asshole?\u201d What was your first clue, Sherlock? I\u2019d give him my mf plate if he was my friend.", "YTA. Did you even ask your venue if it would be possible to include one more person? A month out, they could likely do it", "YTA! You said you would save a spot for him and didn\u2019t! Did you even try to contact him and find out his health status BEFORE you gave his spot away? Wow! Just wow!", "YTA\n\nI feel for your friend. Doing chemo and fighting for your life and then find out a person who you thought is a friend turns out to be an asshole. Thats so sad :(", "YTA.  Having a picture perfect wedding matters more to you, than supporting a friend who's fighting for their life.", "YTA. Your friend is going through something terrifying. All you're caring about is your wedding, where they are facing the possibility of not having a future altogether. I would have kept the wedding open not minding if they didn't end up coming. You've done something incredibly, deeply hurtful that took an extreme lack of empathy. I wouldn't be surprised if you lost your friend over this.", "YTA. You told him you understood and would save his seat and you did the exact opposite. Don\u2019t be surprised if you lose your friend. Because not only did you exclude him in your time of celebration you also ostracized him for basically going through chemo (even though it maybe wasn\u2019t your intentions that\u2019s exactly what happened). So please don\u2019t go bashing him to your mutual friends saying how he\u2019s just being petty. He\u2019s adjusting to your new relationship and rightfully so", "\nYTAH DEFINITELY \ud83d\udcaf \n\nYa couldn\u2019t have held one spot or even better 2 spots for him to be able to come and even bring someone so if he got exhausted or something he had a way to be able to leave and get home without worrying anybody to have to take him?

Note I had treatment today and still awake at 4:53 am.  Cancer treatment is a miserable experience physically and socially.  I would make every effort possible to attend. Even delay treatment a few days so I could feel my best.  The social isolation and dealing with mortality at a young age is unbearable for many.

But, sometimes you need to be more sensitive and honest with others.", "ESH\n\nI\u2019m going against the grain.  For me it\u2019s more about realizing Invites have to go out at least 8 weeks or more prior to the event and rsvp\u2019s are due by a certain date no less than about 4 weeks before the wedding in some situations and you did take into consideration his situation before sending the invite and it would have been nice but you did him a courtesy in a way not putting his health at risk (being immunocompromised is important here too).", "YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE!
