Stuff just laying around, a lot of bags, books and boxes. The house itself is also very old, and Frank explained that the house is under renovation programm, so it will be demolished in a couple of years and he will get a new fresh appartment in a new building for free.

She just arrives without warning and staying for a few days, saying that she's going to die soon, so she wants to spend as much time as she can at her house. Understandable.
