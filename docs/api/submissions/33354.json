My brother and his wife, the parents, passed 8 months ago.\n\nMy cousin Rita (30f) is getting married to her partner Andy (29NB, biologically male).  She would like Jade and Mark to be part of her wedding.\n\nAndy and Rita do not care for traditional gender roles for their wedding. Andy\u2019s best friend growing up is a woman and she would be his best woman. One of Rita\u2019s bridesmaids is a trans woman and another is an NB (biologically female) who will be wearing tuxedo to the wedding. Andy and Rita asked me if Mark can be the flower boy and Jade the ring bearer instead of the traditional roles. Mark would still wear his little tux and Jade a taffeta dress.\n\nI believe as long as it\u2019s not to crazy, whatever the couple wants at their wedding, they should get. I said yes and everyone was happy. Rita took a picture of Jade and Mark and posted on social media captioning \u201cMy flower boy and ring bearer girl.\u201d\n\nA few hours later after the kids and I got home, I got a call from Zoe who was my SIL\u2019s mom and the kids\u2019 grandma. Zoe and Rita were Facebook friends because they\u2019re workplaces did a collaboration once so she saw the picture of Jade and Mark. Zoe blew up at me, telling me Jade and Mark cannot take up those roles. She said if they are not the flower girl and ring boy then they can just attend the wedding as guests. \n\nShe said all these gender fluid hogwash will come back and bite society later and she wants her grandkids away from the drama and neither Rita nor I had the right to place her grandkids amid this gender nonsense. She said Jade and Mark have the right to be protected and kept their activities and participation to things that are gender appropriate. \n\nI personally think Zoe is ridiculous and needs to chill.

I'm all for having a man of honour, a best woman, and a flower boy but because there is no word in ring bearer that is associated with gender even if it is usually a part for boys adding girl in it does make it seem like she is doing this purely to stir up gender norms rather than because she thinks the two would do a better job in those positions.  (DO NOTE: I think having the older kid be the ring bearer is a good call even if I would have tried to find a slightly older kid who is less likely to drop and or lose the rings).  I suppose Ring Bearess would be less clunky and not feel so purposeful but I don't think it really matters.", "NTA \n\nAnd not really serious.. but suggest the 4 y.o.
