TL;DR I'm doing well but it's been a long couple of months!\n\n[To the people who said Polly was lying about booking a flight because it seemed suspiciously cheap/she could've cancelled within 24 hours - she booked on a cheap UK airline and this is fairly standard pricing, plus their cancellation/refund policies are what you'd expect from an airline where they charge you extra just to sit next to the person you booked with! She's many things but not a total liar, she definitely booked after I told her not to.]\n\nAfter everything blew up with Polly, we didn't speak for a couple of weeks. I talked it over with my parents and they said that I was under absolutely no obligation to pay her a penny, which I agree with, as did all of this sub! However they suggested that I could offer to pay a small amount (like 20% of the fare) in the interests of salvaging the friendship. I liked this idea as I was still feeling so heartbroken and didn't want to throw away 10+ years of friendship if avoidable. So I sent her a message explaining that I didn't feel I owed her any money for her mistake, but that I really cared about her and our friendship and that I would be willing to make a small contribution if it meant that we could meet on happier terms in the future and resume our friendship.\n\nWell, she left me on read. For OVER A MONTH. She did eventually reply to tell me that I should still pay the full fare (claiming she was \"seconds away from booking\" when I originally spoke to her), and then messaged me a \"reminder\" of this a few days later. That second day was my birthday and she sent me no well wishes along with it, just a reminder that she wanted money. I'd finally been pushed over the edge, I was absolutely raging and told her it was unacceptable to message me shit like this on my birthday. That was the last time we spoke and I've now blocked her on everything.\n\nIt also turns out she didn't tell as many of our mutual friends as I thought. One of them is no longer speaking to me, I've tried to reach out but she's ignoring me, so I'm leaving it because who needs people like that. Another pair had heard the story and said they want to \"remain neutral\", which makes me think they didn't hear the whole truth, but I can't be bothered to push it as they're still cool with me and don't really care about the Polly drama.\n\nI'm feeling great now, things are going well with my family and I am really enjoying my last few months of semester abroad, I've made some good friends and am having the best time. I wish all the drama had never happened, but I'm grateful to have seen the true colours of someone I would have continued to trust otherwise.

When money is involved friendship ceases.", "It's really sad, but what I learned getting older is that some friendships just have an expiration date. Especially at your age (studying,  spending time abroad, adulting), there is so much development going on, and it's normal to just go into different directions and part ways.\n\nIt might not look like this now, but it might be for the best, seeing how you already have quite  the differences in how you treat friends and what they \"owe\" to you.", "You need new friends.", "You're actually doing your friends who haven't heard the full story a disservice, in addition to yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry to hear that Polly is an irrefutable asshole, but at least you now know. :/", "Funny how money can reveal people's true colors", "I've had friends like this.

Should have been this:\n\n\"I can't host you.\"\n\n\"That's okay, I was planning to visit you in a major Italian city. There is plenty of accommodation, and it is the off-season so it will not be that expensive. I will see you another time. I wish you luck with your mental health.\"", "Thank you!", "People need to accept that staying with friends comes with risk, that's the trade-off for saving money and having a more personal experience when travelling. Humans are prone to humaning: people get seriously sick, have babies, break up, change jobs, need to move, have family drama, start drinking, wreck their cars, disclose awkward feelings, adopt a dozen ferrets, join strict religions, flood their basements, change their minds. A lot of things can suddenly come up that make someone unable to host. When you pay for a hotel or campground one of the things your money gets you is the professionalism and reliability and some recourse if things go wrong. If your travel plans rely on asking friends for favors then you need to be flexible / have a backup plan.", ">didn't want to throw away 10+ years of friendship\n\nNnnnnnoooooooooooo! \n\n>I'm grateful to have seen the true colours of someone I would have continued to trust otherwise\n\nOh thank christ. I'm sure your parents are very nice people but we really need to start teaching our kids that if someone else is doing all the throwing in the \"throwing away\", then it's best to take the hint and go find better friends rather than throwing more good energy/feelings/money after bad on a 'friend' like that. I'm sorry that you had to find out how little she valued your friendship but I'm delighted that you're in a better place and seeking out healthier relationships!", "I'm so happy you're making friends and enjoying your term abroad. Good for you for standing up for yourself and removing her from your life. Ending a friendship that long can be devastating, so it's big to do that!! Hoping things continue to be on an upward swing for you, OP!", "She isn't your friend if you requested space and she refused to give it to you. It's not like you said, \"oh I have other plans now so don't come.\" You told her you were struggling and wouldn't be able to host her. And she insisted on coming anyway. When you gently reiterated your point, she IMMEDIATELY booked a flight. And then had the gall to tell you to reimburse her?\n\nNo.\n\nThe only words out of her mouth when you told her how you were struggling and couldn't host her should have been: think nothing of it, what can I do for you right now?", "As I heard once, People come into your life for a reason or a season.  When that friendship ends, the reason or season has come to an end.", "That was my train of thoughts too. Whilst I hate conflicts, I find that very often they fasten the the kave at which it happens.", "I agree. I think it\u2019s also to do with how people move in their stages in life. Some people are unfortunately gonna be left behind bc they either don\u2019t have the same drive about life or just will have different pathways to their destination in life. It\u2019s all about not letting some people drag you down with themself though. Bc some people just wanna have company for their own misery that you have to be wary of.", "Can\u2019t agree more on that. I had a friendship I had to cut bc one she was very materialistic to the point it become about me not letting be owning her any favors. Ever buying event tickets became were me and other friend bought tickets together separately from her. (She wouldn\u2019t let me buy her her tickets bc I think it has to do with control). I ended up cutting her off for a year. Did lots of good for me and her honestly. Coming back as just friends (no more best friends) I put a boundary that she don\u2019t buy nothing for me that she think she wants me to repay or owe her. I don\u2019t buy her things, she doesn\u2019t do the same for me either. We basically keep to ourselves when it comes to spending.", "Its true. Thats why my idiot brain tortures itself on how to spoil my friends (to whom I owe everything to) without spoiling the friendship, should I ever become stupid rich.", "Considering \u20ac100 is considered a lot for them, I doubt she would be able to afford a week stay in a major Italian city, even with hostels. She was trying to force OP's hand and make her have to stay for her. An evil response to someone opening up about their mental health struggles.", "[deleted]", "I'd disagree, kind of. Definitely see your point.\n\nI feel like the friends are doing themselves a disservice (as opposed to the onus being on OP) and that OP may be better off without them. If you're an adult that hears a negative story about a friend and decides to \"remain neutral\" without making any effort to check in on the other side, I'm not sure I want you around.\n\nSomeone who is that easily swayed one way without looking into it just doesn't seem like the best type of person to be around.", "I always agreed with this phrase and sometimes it\u2019s so delightfully easy to put friendships into each category. I recently went through a pretty massive life change and lost my 3 oldest & closest friends (16+ years) because of it. I\u2019m sure one day I will be able to put a positive spin on it, but until then I just have to accept our reason has ran its course.", "While this is reassuring, I think it's not really accurate or meaningful. \n\nIn my opinion it's a bit much to assume there's a meaning or a reason behind every friendship, and to imply the friendship ending means the \"reason has come to end\".\n\nPeople just come and go. You become friends with people you interact with often and share similar values and interests with. When a friendship ends it's because you either no longer have one of those (or both) in common, or simply because you just get too busy with life and you weren't close enough to maintain it despite that.\n\nA friendship doesn't have to have a deeper meaning or reason behind it for you to appreciate it though.", "I\u2019ve heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason, bringing something we must learn and we are lead to those who help us most to grow if we let them and we help them in return.\n\nWell I don\u2019t know if I believe that\u2019s true, but I memorized the whole thing anyway, and shared it with you!", "The majority of people aren't going to be amazing friends, but it's still good to have a circle of less close friends. For that level of friendship, it would be fair for them to decide to be neutral. I do get what you're saying though. I also would not remain close friends with anyone who didn't check in with me for my side.", "i disagree, sometimes you just can't be bothered by other people's drama. As long as it doesn't effect their relationships then it's fine for them to remain neutral", "You should tell the other \u2018neutral friends\u2019 your side of the story. They\u2019ll never understand if you don\u2019t give your side. The other friend has obviously told all of them her side so it\u2019s fair to tell your side and then they can judge hearing both. Probably if you tell them they will understand clearly and be on your side", "I got real nervous about planning plane tickets with friends for a planned trip. We sent each other pictures of our \"cart\" to confirm we had the right flights and then all confirmed we were ready to purchase. A lot of re confirmation went into it before anyone bought tickets. Then we all pulled the trigger. Never would i just imagine I buy tickets first unless I'm willing to lose that money if it doesnt work out for everyone", "Thanks for posting an update! This was a very satisfying ending IMO. She sounds very toxic and not worth having as a friend anyways. Glad you're feeling better these days :)", "Thank you for sharing", "They're students, I'm just acknowledging that if she can't eat the cost of the plane ticket, I doubt she can unexpectedly pay for a week of hotels beyond other travel expenses. You can probably bet she was relying on OP to feed her at her house and have low-no costs there. She gambled that this would force OP's hand and lost.", "Read the original post, totally NTA\n\nWho doesn\u2019t check dates and times when visiting friends? And you already said you had other plans. AND she expected you to capitulate after leaving it for how long? \n\nAlso re. Your friends, don\u2019t go complaining to them about Polly, if she wants to do it, let her, eventually they\u2019ll get sick of hearing about it.\n\nOr they\u2019ll stop talking to you because they have a stronger loyalty to her.\n\nComplaining about it to your whole friend group comes across as toxic, and it\u2019s not worth it.\n\nI recently had a similar experience, with friends of 10+ years, who would complain about me to all our friend geoup every time", "> because who needs people like that\n\nReading this made me smile, because damn fucking right. Happy to see that you stood up for yourself and removed that awful 'friend' from your life.", "Your friends are not your friends. Or at least, they are fair-weather friends. Do not make the mistake of thinking they are people you can rely on. If you want to remain friendly with them, do so with the knowledge that they will never stick up for you. \"Remaining neutral\" is the cowards way of saying they have no interest in your feelings and they can't be bothered to acknowledge Polly is in the wrong. I hope that you are ok.", "She may have been your friend. But she was never a good one. Glad you're doing well OP.", "congrats on ruining a 10 plus year friendship", "Tell her that if she insists of ignoring without knowing the full story, then consider her existence ceased in your life. Of she doesn't care, then doesn't deserve your friendship.", "I hear that and I personally should be more cognizant of the fact that what I've just read is only one side.\n\nI also don't have a large friend group at all, so I don't really understand the dynamics of having friends that I'm not pretty ride or die for in general. I had a large friend group as a younger person and now that I think about it in those terms, if it were the case that I had a lot of friends (especially if those friends tended to be friends) I might feel a different way. \n\nGood perspective, thank you."]}
