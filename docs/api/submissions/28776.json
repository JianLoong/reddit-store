NTA.", "NTA. he has a job, ubering isn't the best thing in the world but if he's 41, working full time and has never spent a cent on rent in his life he should be loaded. Him being irresponsible with his money is not your problem. I wouldn't be surprised, if he's spending money given for medical costs for parents, that it's on something like gambling as you give a gambling addict a dollar for anything and it's going on gambling instead of what it's for.\n\nHe's also a misogynist, I wouldn't invite him into a house of a lesbian family and expect him to do anything less than assume he's in charge because he's the man of the house.\n\nMaybe what he needs is reality though, bailed out by parents till he's 41, maybe he needs a month in his car to wake up.", "NTA\n\nAs you\u2019ve seen with your parents your brother has stayed as long as possible being a leech by not paying for anything.  \n\nIf you let him spend one night you will likely have to evict him to get him back out.  \n\nThe fact he is essentially an overage teenager is not your problem.", "<<He\u2019s misogynistic, selfish, and thinks he\u2019s better that everybody. >> tell me again why you'd want to let this person in your home where he'll pay nothing, eat everything, mess up everything, expect your wife to wait on him AND NEVER LEAVE.\n\nNTA he can be an adult and figure it out himself.", "NOT IN A MILLION YEARS. NO. NTA", "NTA \n\nPlease don\u2019t be an enabler like your parents. He is a full grown adult. Don\u2019t be a doormat and allow him to move in with you. It\u2019s time he learns how to be a full functional adult. \nAllow him to figure things out for himself by himself. \nDon\u2019t put your husband through such torture. Install security cameras in and outside your house.", "All the more reason to get real with her parents. Give them the info for the homeless shelter for themselves if they don\u2019t finally summon the resolve to kick him out so they can rent the apartment", "The post says he's an Uber driver - whether that's three hours a week or full time hours, no idea. Mummy and daddy are moving out, since he won't - he's going to need to step up, unless he actually prefers living in his car."]}
