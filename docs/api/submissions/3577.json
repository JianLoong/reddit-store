{"id": 3577, "submission_id": "z8hlmd", "title": "WIBTA for reporting my neighbor because her car alarm goes off frequently?", "selftext": "I moved into a neighborhood of townhouses 2 months ago. The very first night, I was woken up in the middle of a night to the sound of a car alarm. I was pretty startled, especially since it was my first night in a new place alone. This continued 3 more times that night, which left me thinking that perhaps someone was actually breaking into cars outside. I shrugged it off the next day when nothing seemed amiss, but was again woken up the next night at that same car alarm. This has continued pretty much every night since I have moved in, with only a few nights I can think of that I don't recall it happening. Some nights, I wake up just once, others it can be multiple. Obviously, I am not sure exactly how often it happens since its possible I sleep through some of them, but it pretty much happens once a night at minimum. The alarms themselves don't last very long, never more than a minute, but its enough to wake me up and usually quite abruptly. \n\nFor context, the community has multiple rows of townhouse buildings, with streets in between. My bedroom is above my garage, and thus right off the little street in between buildings. There are some parallel parking spots for guests and extra cars as well. Because of this, the alarm sound is very loud in my bedroom. \n\nSince this has been going on for at least 2 months, I don\u2019t really see an end in sight. I was telling my friend that I was thinking of talking to our HOA manager about it, but she told me that would make the TA. She said since the alarm only lasts about 30 seconds at a time, and only happens 1-3 times a day, its not that big of a deal and that I should learn to deal with it. In her mind, its likely that the neighbors aren\u2019t fixing it for a reason (i.e. they can\u2019t afford to).\u00a0\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to financially burden the owners, especially around the holidays, however its quite a nuisance to me. Even though it only happens a couple times a day for short periods, it also only happens in the middle of the night, and startles me awake every time. As a recent college grad, I can sleep through noise like a party or loud music/voices, but the alarm is very abrupt and for lack of a better word, alarming. Also, we do have garages, so im not sure why they can\u2019t park it inside. I am not sure who owns the car either, since it doesn\u2019t appear anyone ever drives it, but they do have the option of cleaning out the garage to make room if there isn\u2019t any, or switching the car they park outside. Honestly, Im not even sure if that would help muffle the sound, but I imagine it would help somewhat at least.\u00a0\n\nSo, what does everyone think?

When the first case happened, we waited for hours, then proceed to call the police, they called the owner who came out of his house and simply turned it off. You can say: he was in his house, and his card parked in front of it. \n\nSo now on, we call the police every f time. We had enough, it's really loud, and not easy to work from home...\n\nYour neighbour should take off the battery.", "NTA but, maybe you should first try putting a note on the windshield or something.

I wouldn't have touched my keys, so I just figured it was someone else's vehicle.\n\nThen my roommate came home one day and asked why my car alarm was going off... it turned out to be an issue with one of the door lock sensors and it was a pretty easy fix.", "NTA that sounds horrendous", "YWNBTA.\n\nIn the wee hours of the morning, car alarms are supposed to be a warning of a real problem.

How has everyone in the neighbourhood allowed this to continue for so long? Do you talk to any of your neighbours? Have any of them mentioned it?
