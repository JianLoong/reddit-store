{"id": 1164, "submission_id": "ym0pj4", "title": "AITA for going off on my girlfriend for eating all the food?", "selftext": "Last saturday, we had friends come over for a game night. There was 17 people in our appartment. We bought 200$ worth of hors d'oeuvres such as eggrolls, small pastries with meat or cheese and some chips. As the main dish I asked my aunt to cook us her special macaroni in the over, chicken wings and nuggets. There was so much food, everyone left with a plate. Sunday we ate out of the leftovers but there was still enough food to eat for the rest of the week (there was a lot of food).\n\nShe works from home and I from an office. Sunday night she packed the food in the fridge. I noticed monday morning that there was less macaroni than what was left the previous day (meaning she ate during the night). I'm the type that doesn't like to eat heavy at lunch otherwise it makes me sleepy so I made sandwiches for lunch thinking I'm goin to eat some macaroni, wings and pastries for supper. Monday 7pm when I go to the fridge, all the pastries and chicken wings are gone! At the same time my sister came over to do my girlfriend's hair and I asked :''Honey did you pack the hors d'oeuvres somewhere else, I can't find them?'' She replied there was none left. I didn't want to make a scene in front of my sister so I took a plate of macaroni. The next day (tueday) she made me a steak with veggies for lunch and in the afternoon I had a seminar with paid dinner so I didn't eat none of the leftovers. Then comes wednesday, I had sandwiches for lunch again but when I got home I was hungry, went to the fridge and realised there was no food left. She ate everything, that mountain of food we had for a week is gone.\n\nThat's when I snapped and told her she didn't leave me any. At first she denied eating everything but I told her we're only two here, I only ate a plate when my sister came on monday. Then she said she thought I had taken my share. I told her clearly no. Then she replies there's no use being mad for food when we can just go and buy more. I'm just being petty. I told her it doesn't make sense that you ate all this food in 3 days and that you didn't even notice that I didn't have any. It's easy to say that it's just food when you ate it all.\n\nNow she's mad at me apparently for yelling at her and being too old, (I'm 36), to react like this. I'm 6''1' and 205 and she's 5''8', 185. During the last two years, she gained at least 40 lbs while I've stayed the same. I'm seeing red right now and have no one to vent my anger because I don't want people I know to see her in a bad light. Am I an asshole or not?
