There was 17 people in our appartment. We bought 200$ worth of hors d'oeuvres such as eggrolls, small pastries with meat or cheese and some chips. As the main dish I asked my aunt to cook us her special macaroni in the over, chicken wings and nuggets. There was so much food, everyone left with a plate. Sunday we ate out of the leftovers but there was still enough food to eat for the rest of the week (there was a lot of food).\n\nShe works from home and I from an office. Sunday night she packed the food in the fridge. I noticed monday morning that there was less macaroni than what was left the previous day (meaning she ate during the night). I'm the type that doesn't like to eat heavy at lunch otherwise it makes me sleepy so I made sandwiches for lunch thinking I'm goin to eat some macaroni, wings and pastries for supper. Monday 7pm when I go to the fridge, all the pastries and chicken wings are gone! At the same time my sister came over to do my girlfriend's hair and I asked :''Honey did you pack the hors d'oeuvres somewhere else, I can't find them?'' She replied there was none left. I didn't want to make a scene in front of my sister so I took a plate of macaroni. The next day (tueday) she made me a steak with veggies for lunch and in the afternoon I had a seminar with paid dinner so I didn't eat none of the leftovers. Then comes wednesday, I had sandwiches for lunch again but when I got home I was hungry, went to the fridge and realised there was no food left. She ate everything, that mountain of food we had for a week is gone.\n\nThat's when I snapped and told her she didn't leave me any. At first she denied eating everything but I told her we're only two here, I only ate a plate when my sister came on monday. Then she said she thought I had taken my share. I told her clearly no. Then she replies there's no use being mad for food when we can just go and buy more. I'm just being petty. I told her it doesn't make sense that you ate all this food in 3 days and that you didn't even notice that I didn't have any. It's easy to say that it's just food when you ate it all.\n\nNow she's mad at me apparently for yelling at her and being too old, (I'm 36), to react like this. I'm 6''1' and 205 and she's 5''8', 185. During the last two years, she gained at least 40 lbs while I've stayed the same. I'm seeing red right now and have no one to vent my anger because I don't want people I know to see her in a bad light. Am I an asshole or not?

If she had normal portions for lunch and dinner than ya, it's probably all gone.\n\nI doubt this lady pulled a chair up to the fridge buffet and didn't come up for air.  Why didn't you ask for certain things to be put aside? \nCOMMUNICATION...works wonders.", "i mean\u2026 there was 4 days between the food being made and it being gone\u2026. more of your aunt made the food a day early to drop off\u2026. how long should she have not eaten it for you to get to it? food safety is a valid concern here. and it would be wasteful to make more food while there is prepped food that needs to be eaten. Also, you could just have said: hey babe, leave me some of the mac for wednesday night, i m looking forward to it\u201d\nSo yeah, YTA", "The fact that she made you fresh food (steak) for work and you are mad at her for eating leftovers that you didn't eat for 3-4 days?? You know food goes bad, right? You should say thank you. And next time you want specific leftovers ask her to save you some. \nYou keep mentioning meals you are eating out. She is at home all day and being economically sound by eating the leftovers. \nIt sounds more like you are angry at her for gaining weight.", "YTA because it might be worth mentioning offhand as a minor annoyance...*calmly*...but instead you're losing your shit and *seeing red* like a maniac and yelling. Calm down. It's just food and you didn't get to it over multiple days. This is not a real problem and not worth this level of rage.", "YTA. You had leftovers, which would only keep for a few days, and you kept eating other stuff instead, because you were out or because she cooked fresh for you. She also thought you'd been picking at it too. You're just mad about her weight, which is irrelevant to the story.", "YTA, she ate leftovers over a reasonable course of days and for some reason, you chose not to partake during that time. Next time, set aside a small container if you wanna eat really stale food", "YTA. Did you not tell her you planned to eat this on future days? Was she expected to read your mind? There are 4 people in my home and if there is something in the fridge I plan on having at a future date I make sure my husband knows. Otherwise all good is yo for grabs. Related to this when I do big grocery shops and have something specific as an ingredient that could be eaten alone, say fresh mozzarella, I make sure to tell him that I plan to use this for a recipe. He can\u2019t read my mind. If you just went about your business and said nothing about the food it was just as much her right to eat it as yours. You can\u2019t police how much she ate. As you said, the recipe is famous so she was probably excited to enjoy this food throughout the week and you had other things you either made for yourself or had planned to attend. You are being incredibly selfish and childish. Communication is key. And if this in any way is even slightly related to her weight gain it\u2019s even worse.", "Yta. You aren't mad that she ate the leftovers. You're mad that she's eating and gaining weight and not apologetic", "Mild YTA.  It's leftovers, it's been there for days, it doesn't sound like you specifically discussed it, why wouldn't you eat it.\n\nUNLESS...\n\nUnless what you're really angry about is her weight, in which case it just sounds like you both have different priorities and you should let her go so that some more sensible man can enjoy her plump macaroni-fed self.", "YTA\n\nTrust me.  No one reading this sees HER in a bad light.\n\nSo you're mad that she ate leftovers for a week while you chose not to (save one plate).  Did you ever ask her to put some of the food aside for you or is it just expected that you get first dibs?\n\nHonestly this all could have been avoided with a little communication.  Now you're just having a temper tantrum and projecting your issues with her weight gain.  Not a good look for you.", "To me, YTA. \n\nIf it were less days i would go n.t.a. But since it were a lot of days since the food was prepared, you didn't say you wanted to save some, didn't freeze some or communicated your expectations, I think 4 days is a reasonable time to eat things that are leftovers.\n\nAlso, you noticed she was eating and instead of asking her to save some you ignored it. And then yelled at her. Also, in the end you seem to be more concerned about her weight than anything else.", "I keep thinking how much leftovers there were and how can someone wanna eat 4-5 Day old leftovers and have an argument about it. I don't know about the amount of the leftovers but there were 17 People, so there shouldn't left a huuuuge amount. Yta op, i agree with your gf, you are too old for this kind of argument.", "Info: is this REALLY about the food being gone or is it about her gaining weight. Cause, honestly, neither of your heights or weights is at all relevant and yet you felt the need to mention it anyways. I\u2019m thinking you may be harboring some resentment about it. I can\u2019t think of any other reason you\u2019d feel the need to include it.", "Info: why did you mention y\u2019all\u2019s heights and weights and *why* is her gaining weight relevant to this?", "YTA. I get that it was a dish your aunt specially cooked for you. But you didn't seem interested. You are other things. Leftovers have a shelf life. She probably thought eating the leftovers instead of sandwiches was keeping food from going to waste. \nNext time tell anyone you share a refrigerator with \"hey, I really love my aunt's macaroni. I don't want it right now but can you please make sure some gets saved for me?\"\nYou're allowed to have feelings about her weight gain. Physical attraction is a component even of an established relationship. Bodies change over time.  If having a thin partner is your biggest priority, cool.  But you aren't allowed to punish her or judge her or look down on her because of it. Admit that you're the one with the problem and do the kind thing and leave her rather than treating her like shit. That isn't going to make her slim down and breeding anger inside yourself doesn't help you.", "You kept eating other things instead of the leftovers, so YTA to being mad at her for eating them. It's fair game till it's gone.", "YTA\n\nShe ate leftovers for days, possibly for most of her meals, while you were eating other things, including a fresh lunch she cooked for you and a dinner out on the company dime. Was she supposed to leave the leftovers for you and cook fresh food for most of her own meals, with all that food sitting around occupying the fridge? Why did you think the food would last a week? Stuff like that doesn\u2019t keep a week in the fridge anyway. Stale pastries, gummy macaroni\u2014no, you eat it or freeze it in 3 days.\n\nIn my house, when we have leftovers like that, I expect everyone to be eating them and I don\u2019t cook. I\u2019ll maybe make a salad to go with if there aren\u2019t enough veggies included. Or if there are a lot and we really aren\u2019t going to eat them right away, I pack a bunch into the freezer. But the idea of just *not eating* tasty food that\u2019s ready to go, while my spouse is swanning about about having nice dinners and a steak lunch\u2026nope.", "Wow YTA. We don't need to know your weights and sizes, they don't matter. She was hungry, she ate. Sure, she could've asked you if you want some before she finished everything up, but you overreacted and i'm not surprised she said what she said. \n\nJust go buy more food or order a delivery, it's not the end of the world.\n\nEDIT to add: you took sandwiches to work. Idk about you, but if my bf took sandwiches to work, instead of leftovers, I would eat the leftovers, since he clearly is not interested in them.", "Daaaaang! YTA. Why do you feel the need to police how much of which leftover she eats? Is this a hill you are willing to die on? Lose a relationship?", "YTA. If the problem was that you wanted some of it, you should have asked her to leave you some, or packed up a box for yourself and asked her to leave those for you to eat.\n\nThat\u2019s not the issue though. The issue is that she\u2019s gained weight and you don\u2019t like it, so now you are shaming her for eating a lot of food.\n\nLemme ask you this. Did she ask you for help in eating better? If not, then you are starting to get controlling. Getting mad and belittling her and yelling at her, over *leftovers*, is *very* concerning. If she had a magic metabolism and could eat like that and not put on weight, would you have cared as much? Is money an issue at all? Is any of this because all that food costed money? Are you a miser (in that you\u2019re not poor and can easily afford it)? Or is money tight and you were hoping the dollar paid for the food would go further? And then on top of that, her figure is changing in a way that displeases you?\n\nYou need to figure out what your problem is so you can communicate your feelings in a constructive way.", "YTA\n\nDid you just want it all to sit in the fridge until it rotted?", "Why did you bring up her weight and her weight gain when explaining this? I suspect it\u2019s because she\u2019s not as thin as she used to be and that\u2019s what you\u2019re really resentful over. \n\nIt\u2019s 4 day old food that was out for a party. The Mac n cheese is not actually famous, no matter how many times you say it. Look down deep and see why you are really annoyed. \n\nWhen you have a real reason then I can say if YTA , until then INFO", "Bruh that pasta was 4 days old, and the chicken wings were 2. \n\n*After 2 days if chicken is left on the bone and then eaten its a great way to get really sick. You get more time if you remove off the bone but yeah. \n\nI'm gonna be real, you had time to eat that food. That food, no matter how much there *was* isnt even good after a couple of days tbh. \n\nYou calling your girlfriend selfish, and then just dropping \"she's gained 40 pounds in 2 years\" makes me think that the iranian yogurt isnt the issue here. The issue here is your girlfriend has gained weight and it's upsetting you and instead of just saying *that* you're saying all of this. Because honestly? I can't figure out what the hell you needed to add eirher one of your height and weights into this, and seemed to say as a taller person I need more food? \n\nI get why you are pissed off. I think her trying to pretend she didn't eat all of it is what actually set you off here. Because unless there is a ghost in your house, then yeah, she did. \n\nEdit - bro you had more than enough time to eat that food, pasta with dairy isnt safe to eat after a couple of days, just like chicken thats still on the bone. \n\nWe go by your time table you were trying to make the food last way longer than is safe for what reason exactly? \n\nAlso when iy comes to your aunts macaroni bro she only lives an hour away. You have a car. Go visit her. Or learn how to cook. \n\nThis has *nothing* to do with anything other than youre pissed pff your gf has gained weight. She she hadnt eaten that food it would have gone bad and been wasted. You're a fucking adult make youself a plate and wrap it up and put your name on it ffs. Or just eat rhe goddamn food no matter if 'heavy food makes you sleepy\" if you eat ir for lunch. Bro chicken wings and pasteries aren't heavy. If you wanted it you should have eaten it and not make excuses. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You overreacted. Leftovers have a shelf life and you constantly bypassed them. Meaning they\u2019re up for grabs. YTA also for mentioning her weight which you\u2019re clearly upset over. Let your gf go find someone who loves her for the way she is. Plus it\u2019s an easy way for her to drop 200lbs", "200 bucks and 17 ppl ate initially. That doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019d make a lot of leftovers. And it all fit in your fridge? Doesn\u2019t sound like a lot of food. Plus your gf works from home. So she\u2019s eating 3 meals a day for 4 days. That\u2019s 12 meals she made from the leftovers. 8 if you don\u2019t count breakfast. That doesn\u2019t sound unreasonable. \n\nYou bringing up her weight at the end though?

In this household if I eat all the ice cream I'm required to warn my partner before he comes home. This rule was set by us talking about it like adults and communicating our expectations. It wasn't a fight because it didn't need to be. \n\nI will eat leftovers if they've been sitting in the fridge for more than 2 days because at that point they're about to go bad. That's another thing we've talked over. \n\nTalk to you gf dude. And your sizes are irrelevant. People gain and lose weight throughout their life. If you can't handle that maybe a long term relationship isn't for you.", "YTA how long do you think leftovers are good for? If you are concerned about her weight, you picked the absolute worst way to express it to her.", "YTA. It's one thing to expect someone not to eat all of a treat. But there is a fridge full of things that will spoil if not eaten, and it would be more assholish to allow it to go bad while waiting for you to get around to helping eat it all.", "YTA\n\nIt's leftovers!", "YTA you sound like an extremely unpleasant partner and person in general", "I agree with others that weight and size doesn\u2019t matter but wtf???? If she used to be 5\u20198 and 140lbs??? For many years?! That weight gain was necessary. \n\nPlus, do you care enough about her to ask compassionately if she might have an eating disorder? Large amounts of food disappearing when the person is a reasonable weight can sometimes signal bulimia. \n\nOtherwise, she was enjoying the holiday. Have a problem with her weight and eating? Move on. This could be completely normal. Label your food if you want to make sure there are leftovers for you.\n\nIf you were with a male partner, would you have the same expectations? Just wondering.", "YTA, it's been several days and at no point did you ask your gf to set some aside for you to eat. Your issue here is either communication (just tell your gf if there's something particular you want to eat later and ask if she can eat something else, she can't read minds) or you're upset about her weight and don't want to address it. It's not \"selfish\" to eat food that isn't being eaten In Your Own House.", "YTA. The food was there for the taking. And why do you know her weight???", "YTA - why does her weight matter?! Pack your own lunch?! It\u2019s leftovers, build a bridge?!", "I totally get that coming home and being excited for some delicious food you left out, and how frustrating it is when it's gone. However, the mention of her weight gain is irrelevant to this story unless it's something that is bothering you.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is just food that you can go out and buy or ask your aunt to make more macaroni. Is this something you're willing to be upset over and risk losing your girlfriend over some replaceable food?", "YTA for overreacting about some leftovers. Looking at your post history, maybe you need some \"alone time\" so you can relax a little bit", "YTA... 2 day rule, my dude... And don't say a thing about her weight. Women gain weight as they get older. It's natural. Did you expect her not to change? That sounds like a you problem .", "Yta.

It also sounds like you have more of a issue with how much she's eating and her weight gain since you felt the need to point it out.

I can\u2019t believe the level of entitlement and stupidity here. If you were worried on Monday, why not say something?\n\nGrow up. I hope your GF finds a partner who loves her and her body.", "YTA. You're mad about two different things and you're trying to sell them as the same thing. First of all, leftovers are first come, first serve. If there's something specific you wish to claim you inform everybody else so they know. \n\nSecond, if you have a problem with your girlfriend's weight, talk to her. That's why YTA - because you're not communicating with her. You're both adults, ffs.", "YTA but Wednesday night that food needed to be in the trash. Also you monitored how much food was put in the fridge the first night and how much was there the next morning? Controlling much? You ignored the leftovers for days but your gf is supposed to read you mind to know when you wanted them? Do her a favor and get out of her life. She deserves better.", "YTA you had so many opportunities to eat the leftovers and you chose different food instead - why would she assume you wanted them? \n\nIt had been 4 or 5 days at this point, if she didn't finish them they would have had to be chucked out anyway", "YTA be honest this is about her weight not 5 day old macaroni. You had some monday, proceeded to ignore the leftovers, never asked her to leave some for you. Most people heat up leftovers for every meal to avoid cooking,  you chose to eat other stuff thats on you. Next time use your words and ask her to put a plate aside or you know do it yourself.", "So your girlfriend's eating in secret, lying about it, and gaining weight over time... And your reaction is to get angry with her about it? YTA just for that.\n\nAnd then there's the comments you've made on other posts - your gf has admitted to you she feels insecure and unattractive around you and especially in your sex life; and you admit to watching porn and masturbating when she's not there. Trust me, she knows about that - you are not as subtle as you think you are, even if you are trying to hide it. The two of you should've seen a counsellor about this a long time ago, really.\n\nShe clearly feels judged and possibly a bit apprehensive about your reactions here. You mentioning her weight gain as part of your argument that you aren't an asshole for getting mad at her really just highlights that you (and probably she) find that weight gain unattractive and that you have put it down to poor self-discipline on her part and are thinking yourself superior for not having had the same happen - nevermind that there's all sorts of reasons why men find it easier to burn calories than women and have more predictable and regular hormonal responses, especially as we get older, and that there's clearly an emotional comonent to this that you've missed altogether.\n\nThere is more to this than selfishness or greed on her part, and it's a little sad that you haven't seen it. Your partner is working from home and overeating during the times she's alone. She may very well be lonely or upset about something, and probably has very low self-esteem especially given how you treated her - but instead of asking her about that and trying to get to the root of why she's trying to eat her feelings, you're just getting mad because you didn't get some 4-day-old pasta. Bravo, dude.", "Yta.\n\nYou yelled at her like a child throwing a tantrum over food. Did you say, \"hey please make sure you leave me a plate\" since you know she works from home?\n\nWhen I have lots of left overs I make it into lunch & dinner to avoid extra cooking.\n\nYou also seem to be attacking her weight as a result of your anger more then anything else. \n\nYou need to get a handle on your emotions, because if a man ever screamed at me, I'd be gone by morning.\n\nLearn to discuss disagreements and frustrations like an adult. Communication is not screaming, yelling and degrading someone.", "YTA- Why would you not just communicate you wanted some of the leftovers? like???? you literally could have sent a text about this my guy\n\nYou\u2019re 36 years old, communicate properly or accept that if you don\u2019t say you want macaroni you\u2019re not going to have macaroni", "Imagine being upset over not getting 4 day old macaroni when you have a girlfriend cooking you fresh food for dinner\n\n\n\nYou're pathetic. YTA your girlfriend is a Saint for being with you. Hopefully she comes to her senses and leaves you. I certainly would if I was dating the human embodiment of moldy leftovers.\n\n\nMen like you make me wish I was gay.", "YTA. There were 17 people there for the party and they all ate during said party. OP also stated that everyone there took food home with them. Plus whatever they ate on Sunday while at home.

While I wouldn't eat all the leftovers from a shared fridge I've learned not everyone shares that same way of thinking.  \n\nSecond, it sounds like you should be concerned about her health if you aren't.
