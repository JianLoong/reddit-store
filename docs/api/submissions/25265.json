Forces me to do household chores while doing nothing because I am female. Says if I want everything equal I (F16) can pay for my vacation. AITA? \n\nMy dad (43) is an engineer working full time, my mom (42) a SAHM.\n\nWhen we are at home, my mom does most of the housework and I do help her with chores, my dad does very little (about 5%) which is perfectly fine. We never argued about that. \n\nBut currently we are on vacation and it bothers me that my father won't do anything which is fine because it's fine by my mother BUT he forces ME to do those chores. Little chores, not even worth mentioning (like cleaning the kitchen after a meal). But it enrages me that he will meanwhile sit on the sofa having no excuse but being male. \n\nI brought this up yesterday. My father said it's fine, that women do the chores around the house and men do harder things to earn money like chopping wood. I told him that's not the case in this situation. He is on vacation - as mom and I are - and does not work. He started getting aggressive, calling me names and that not everything can be split up 50/50 all the time and sometimes one person wants to do something good for the other person. I said you don't force doing something good and that he was being unreasonably aggressive because he has no arguments. \n\nI went to the bathroom and came back, he said he wanted to discuss the matter - confident that he had the breaking argument:\n\nHe said that if I want everything equal I could pay for my share of the vacation. I replied saying that I'm his child, I go to school and don't work. He said he doesn't have to take me on vacation. \n\n... which is true but does this justify his doing nothing to help mum but forcing me to do so because I am \"going to be a wife and mother\"? \n\nI can't help but feel a bit bratty now and would like a third party opinion. So Reddit, AITA? \n\n(again: My problem is not doing chores if he does them too, it's his attitude that I think is sexist)\n\n\nEdit: (because some people think I refuse to do the chores) I do them, mostly without complaint. This argument took place when my dad and I were having a conversation.", "created_utc": 1692719912, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y9zal/aita_for_being_bothered_by_my_dad_forcing_me_to/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, helping out extra on a vacation you didn't have to pay/ work for, is to be expected IMO.\n\nI might be biased, as my family couldn't afford vacations, but my friends families took me on theirs, and since I was around your age at the time, I did everything I could to help out and make it as stress-free as I could for my \"second family\".\n\nYour dad is not in the right about the sexist comment, but is right about you/ everyone else helping out.\n\nYou're in the right for feeling hurt about the sexist comment, but not so much about not wanting to do a little extra.", "NTA\n\nHe's taking a sexist attitude along with him on vacation.

You do know that going on a vacation with a kid is not really a vacation for a SAHP unless they are somewhere where every meal is cooked and served to them, they don't have to clean up, do laundry, grocery shop, and they never have to keep track of you or have to deal with your complaints?  You are because they are \"small chores.\"  It is between your mother and him as to who does chores.  You do not get to assign them to the others in the household.  You are not blaming both of your parents which is what you should be doing.  Your mom is sexist for allowing him to make those sort of comments, but not for having you do chores.  Your father is right.  You want a vacation where you have to do nothing, start saving up so you can afford to go to one of the places where everything it taken care of for you.

Both as a kid, and as an adult, its soft-expected that you contribute more to the chores during the vacation since the parents worked hard to provide that for you. Its a blessing.

If your dad is the only one who works, and is fully paying for the vacation, I do not think it\u2019s unreasonable that he gets to relax while you tidy up the kitchen.
