Forces me to do household chores while doing nothing because I am female. Says if I want everything equal I (F16) can pay for my vacation. AITA? \n\nMy dad (43) is an engineer working full time, my mom (42) a SAHM.\n\nWhen we are at home, my mom does most of the housework and I do help her with chores, my dad does very little (about 5%) which is perfectly fine. We never argued about that. \n\nBut currently we are on vacation and it bothers me that my father won't do anything which is fine because it's fine by my mother BUT he forces ME to do those chores. Little chores, not even worth mentioning (like cleaning the kitchen after a meal). But it enrages me that he will meanwhile sit on the sofa having no excuse but being male. \n\nI brought this up yesterday. My father said it's fine, that women do the chores around the house and men do harder things to earn money like chopping wood. I told him that's not the case in this situation. He is on vacation - as mom and I are - and does not work. He started getting aggressive, calling me names and that not everything can be split up 50/50 all the time and sometimes one person wants to do something good for the other person. I said you don't force doing something good and that he was being unreasonably aggressive because he has no arguments. \n\nI went to the bathroom and came back, he said he wanted to discuss the matter - confident that he had the breaking argument:\n\nHe said that if I want everything equal I could pay for my share of the vacation. I replied saying that I'm his child, I go to school and don't work. He said he doesn't have to take me on vacation. \n\n... which is true but does this justify his doing nothing to help mum but forcing me to do so because I am \"going to be a wife and mother\"? \n\nI can't help but feel a bit bratty now and would like a third party opinion. So Reddit, AITA? \n\n(again: My problem is not doing chores if he does them too, it's his attitude that I think is sexist)\n\n\nEdit: (because some people think I refuse to do the chores) I do them, mostly without complaint.

You are because they are \"small chores.\"  It is between your mother and him as to who does chores.  You do not get to assign them to the others in the household.  You are not blaming both of your parents which is what you should be doing.  Your mom is sexist for allowing him to make those sort of comments, but not for having you do chores.  Your father is right.  You want a vacation where you have to do nothing, start saving up so you can afford to go to one of the places where everything it taken care of for you.

Being childfree by choice is absolutely a valid option for you. I'm 33yo, and will never ever have children. I was medically sterilized last year (and I'm actually having a hysterectomy tomorrow for other health reasons), but please remember that \"because I don't feel like it\" is a valid reason to never have kids.\n\nYour father is absolutely sexist, and I'd argue that just because he's the breadwinner is still not a reason to refuse to contribute to the daily home life... because *he lives there*.\n\nThere's no such division of girl/boy chores- one of my favorite Instagrammers is a woman and she chops wood better than any man I've ever seen... with both axes she's forged herself, and a sword. (I'd also be willing to bet that your father wouldn't be able to properly chop wood if he tried, it's genuinely harder than it looks for first-timers)\n\nHe's a sexist asshole... and one day soon, you will be able to go No Contact and cut him out of your life.", "NTA!

It\u2019s sexism for girls to do housework. And it\u2019s undoubtedly not sexism that the mom is a SAHM who takes care of the house and children.
