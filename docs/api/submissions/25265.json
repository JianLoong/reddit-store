Forces me to do household chores while doing nothing because I am female. Says if I want everything equal I (F16) can pay for my vacation. AITA? \n\nMy dad (43) is an engineer working full time, my mom (42) a SAHM.\n\nWhen we are at home, my mom does most of the housework and I do help her with chores, my dad does very little (about 5%) which is perfectly fine. We never argued about that. \n\nBut currently we are on vacation and it bothers me that my father won't do anything which is fine because it's fine by my mother BUT he forces ME to do those chores. Little chores, not even worth mentioning (like cleaning the kitchen after a meal). But it enrages me that he will meanwhile sit on the sofa having no excuse but being male. \n\nI brought this up yesterday. My father said it's fine, that women do the chores around the house and men do harder things to earn money like chopping wood. I told him that's not the case in this situation. He is on vacation - as mom and I are - and does not work. He started getting aggressive, calling me names and that not everything can be split up 50/50 all the time and sometimes one person wants to do something good for the other person. I said you don't force doing something good and that he was being unreasonably aggressive because he has no arguments. \n\nI went to the bathroom and came back, he said he wanted to discuss the matter - confident that he had the breaking argument:\n\nHe said that if I want everything equal I could pay for my share of the vacation. I replied saying that I'm his child, I go to school and don't work. He said he doesn't have to take me on vacation. \n\n... which is true but does this justify his doing nothing to help mum but forcing me to do so because I am \"going to be a wife and mother\"? \n\nI can't help but feel a bit bratty now and would like a third party opinion. So Reddit, AITA? \n\n(again: My problem is not doing chores if he does them too, it's his attitude that I think is sexist)\n\n\nEdit: (because some people think I refuse to do the chores) I do them, mostly without complaint.

You are because they are \"small chores.\"  It is between your mother and him as to who does chores.  You do not get to assign them to the others in the household.  You are not blaming both of your parents which is what you should be doing.  Your mom is sexist for allowing him to make those sort of comments, but not for having you do chores.  Your father is right.  You want a vacation where you have to do nothing, start saving up so you can afford to go to one of the places where everything it taken care of for you.

There has to be some benefit for being the sole provider for the family...looks like a work free vacation is it.", "It does not seem like OP is being asked to do everything. \n\n\"Little chores, not even worth mentioning (like cleaning the kitchen after a meal).\"\n\nIf OP was being asked to do everything while dad and mom sat around I would agree. \n\nDad is sexist, and he is an ahole for that. But ultimately what OP is being asked to do sounds reasonable. Dad is an even bigger ahole to the mom because he is letting her do most of the work on vacation, but I regards to what he is asking OP to do it is fine. \n\nThink of if this way, if you need a place to stay and I let you move in and charge you reasonable/market rate rent for a room, and then I let someone else move in for free, it does not really matter why you have to pay and the other person does not, even if it was for a sexist reason.", "Thanks for your reply, I think it makes sense \ud83d\ude42\n\nI should have not seen it as sexist to do those chores as my dad contributes in other forms. (his arguments still being sexist)", "This is kinda where I land. The dad asking you to clean up after dinner is perfectly reasonable in a parent/child relationship. His justification for the ask is not valid, it would have been more acceptable to say \u201cbecause I\u2019m the father and I say so.\u201d A clean living area is not gender specific role, but obeying reasonable asks/demands of your parent is a dynamic of the family role", "Right? \n\nIt\u2019s also a logic fail to insist her contributions to the household specifically be done through gendered stereotype chores.", "I adore that the daughter challenges folks like you and the end you can say is do as you\u2019re told.\n\nBecause we see through the \u201cdo the sexist chores and then complain about sexism logic fail.\n\nHahahahahahahahahsh", "Where's Mom's work free vacation?", "This isn't what the OP was asking about.  \n\nDon't know.  Maybe she gets a work free vacation, maybe she doesn't.  That is a whole other topic entirely and we have no idea how that works in this family."]}
