It does children good to have mentors outside the family.", "NTA i am now 33m, when i was 11 i met one of my mothers coworkers, an older male around 40s , he would talk to me all the time on the phone and play video games with me, and HIS dad too would play the games. It was a really wholesome interaction that showed me a father and son can play games together and be happy doing it\u2026 i needed that at the time and didn\u2019t know it. \n\nHe never was mean, never did anything inappropriate, he was just a nerdy older dude playing games\n\nWe would play EverQuest 1 together online , the first MMORPG and he would help me with strategies, i learned advanced vocabulary for my age, and i believe it very much benefited my development, the game also taught cooperative play and group strategies, ill never forget him, he was a kind and funny guy", "EDIT: There\u2019s a vote for no assholes? Let me change it to NAH. The original was YOU, but I hate calling you an asshole because your heart is in the right place. This might be unpopular, but I\u2019m a teacher and will absolutely not friend minors. I won\u2019t friend them until a year or two after they graduate HS, if I do at all. One of the best students (16M)  I\u2019ve ever had recently tried to send me a friend request, and I blocked him. I adore this kid, and would love to catch up with him, as with a lot of my students. I did it with the hope of adding him in a few years when he\u2019s older and more mature. I do post some content that isn\u2019t family friendly. I love being a mentor to my students but I think that adding them too soon or while they\u2019re still minors might sour their perception of me or influence them. They still look up to teachers after they leave the class. \n\nAlso, there are teachers who are predators. It\u2019s rare, but we\u2019ve all seen the news stories. If she has an adult as a friend, the teacher\u2019s adult friends will be able to see your child\u2019s profile, and some might have sinister intentions. \n\nI just woke up, so my thoughts aren\u2019t very coherent. I might add more later. I need coffee.", "I don't think yta but why is a 35yo woman befriending a 13yo? That's creepy no matter what the genders are.", "NTA  \nEven if Noelle had been a man I would still say NTA. The main point here is that you know Noelle personally and also spend time with her. Your daughter has basically just friended a family friend by this point. I do get that a 13 year old kid has to be very careful what she gets herself into on the internet, but this particular relationship doesn\u2019t ring any alarm bells in my book. If your husband is concerned he needs to articulate what he is concerned about if you are to have a discussion about it.", "NAH (in your family). Everyone's feelings are valid here - your daughter's in wanting to be friends with Noelle, your ex's in being concerned about an adult being friends with a 13 year old on FB, your in feeling that you know Noelle well enough to feel there is enough trust this is okay.\n\nTbh, the biggest question mark is over Noelle. Whilst the school may not have a policy around former students, from a safeguarding perspective this is the type of situation where *good practice* would suggest not contacting former pupils on social media - even innocently; that's in no small part to protect the adult in case any accusations of inappropriate behaviour were made. I'm sure it's all very innocent, but just be conscious to keep an eye on the comms as much as possible - and make sure your daughter knows about online safety.", "With my own experiences, I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nI understand both sides of this argument. The best way to teach kids about *safe* relationships with adults is for them to have them and communicate. 13 also isn't a horrible age for social media, but as a kid who had free range to of the internet after 14. It should definitely be monitored. I had more than a few friends who saw *things* on omegle.\n\nI have two personal examples, one of which is positive and one of which is negative.\n\nI'll start with the positive. I put  a lot of play time into MMOs during my teens. It was a mid tier mmo, so a much smaller community compared to like WoW, FF14, Guild Wars, or Runescrape. I tended to end up in the guilds that were basically all retired or active military, so they were often my parents' age. I met a few guys there who took me under their wing. One of them actually became good friends with my parents after I got them into the game. He basically became an honorary uncle with how much time we spent all together. We even played other games together, including WoW classic when it came out. I even got to meet him IRL once. We also shared the live stream of my high school graduation. He was a really awesome guy. We have sadly not kept up contact, but I have amazing memories with him and other adults I met in that MMO.\n\nNow, the negative is much shorter but more of an understanding of how quickly your identity can spread online. So, my Facebook is functionally dead. Other than a handful of posts, alt accounts created for games, and my wedding/engagement post, my Facebook is dead. Probably less than 50 posts in an over 10 year old account. The background is important cause like I barely even show up on Google, even with my madien name.\n\nI was 13 at the time in the grocery store with my mom and my sister. I suddenly hear my name. I turn and see a very dirty homeless man who looks like he picked. \n\nI froze.\n\nHe started coming towards me. My mom grabbed me and took over the conversation, asking him to leave. I was so scared.\n\nLater on, my mom told me that was one of her cousins  who saw my *on my gandfathers facebook*. \n\nThis showed me how easy it is for people to find me online via Facebook friends or similar associates. I figured out how to lock everything down and never posted my full name anywhere. When I gamed I *only gave my nickname* to people who I had tons of hours with, and to those who gave me theirs. Most of them just used my in game any anyways.\n\nThus shaped on how I will treat social media usage with my kids.\n\n\nI believe safe relationships with adults show kids how other adults should *not* act. It also creates a network of trust. I used this network of trust in WoW classic when I guild mate in DMs asked me what *porn* I watched.\n\nAt the same time, though, it is a risk *everytime* especially online. As the kid gets older and gains more and more freedom on the internet, the risk becomes higher and higher.\n\nI don't think there are any AH just concerned adults looking out for a kid in their own way.", "I am so split here.\n\nI'm a parent, and I AM friends with one of my kid's old teachers. She was a huge part of our life for years and despite being across the country we learned we went to the same college at the same time. Her and I hang out, I've watched her newborn and she sees my kids outside of school.\n\nShe would NEVER add my daughter on social media. Now, my daughter is younger and she is disabled. That's why this teacher was so important to us. She was there as we worked through the earlier years of my daughter's disabilities.\n\nBut she is not my DAUGHTER'S friend, she is my friend. Does my daughter still treat her like a trusted adult and mentor? Yes, but she does not have unsupervised access to my children. And again, I KNOW she's not a predator.\n\nI also understand needing that mentor at 13 after years of bullying. I clung to a friend of my Mom's and he absolutely helped coach me through the tough things. He's on my social media now, but I'm not a teen. Other adults my parents thought we're safe, weren't....\n\nNow that I've typed this all out... You're N. T.  A. \n\nBut your husband has a point. No adult needs unrestricted access to a child like that. I know you say she's safe, but you should consider that a 35yo can be a MENTOR to a 13yo but shouldn't be a friend. I'd suggest that your daughter and this mentor only have contact through you and at events where you are present.\n\nNAH.", "NTA, it is actually good influence for children to have good adult examples (including how to behave on social media) in their life. Boxing children just with children does not teach them how one should behave as an adult.", "Ehhhh I'm gonna go with YTA here. Noelle is probably a fine and safe person, but as someone who has taught kids, I am 100% skeptical of teachers who allow children to interact with them on their personal social media. Every teacher I've ever known who did that had poor boundaries with kids. I'm not saying that they were child predators or anything, but many of them overshared with a kid, asked the kid to keep secrets from their parents, leaned too hard on a literal child as a 'friend,' or would be careless with the kid's friendship in a way a kid doesn't understand.\n\nIf you, your kid, and Noelle want to go get coffee together in a way that feels like a grown-up hang, that's great! Or you and Noelle could take your kids to the park together. But Noelle doesn't need to be friends with your kid on social media.", "NTA This is someone known to both you and your daughter, not a stranger.  Your daughter is no longer her student.  If it brings your daughter some joy keeping in contact this way with her former teacher and you know her yourself, I don't see the problem.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s appropriate for parents to curate their child\u2019s friend list at that age. But doing so on a case by case basis and involving the child and making sure your decisions are reasonable helps teach your child good decision making and risk management.\n\nImplementing and enforcing simplistic, arbitrary, and unreasonable rules like her dad\u2019s is bad parenting and a bad start to the teen years.", "NTA. But I would tell your daughter you want to monitor her communivations with her in some form. They are by definition not on equal footing, even if there is nothingnmalicious going on.", "NTA\n\nI'm friends with two neighbours who are 40 years older than me.\n\nAnd it is just facebook.", "NTA. It's a social media \"friendship\", it's not like they're hanging out, go clubbing and smoke pot together. I don't see a problem here, especially if you yourself are familiar/friendly with Noelle and have seen the content she is posting and sharing. Your ex-husband needs to chill out!", "YTA - That's what you get when you introduce social media to kids from a young age.\n\nYour lack of action is creating a precedent that its acceptable to have social media friends with adults.\n\nYou will have a hard time explaining your kid why that is an exception to the rule.", "NTA, this kind of thing is at your discretion and you made a judgement call that seems good to me", "NTA.If you work in a school, you have to go through a federal background check (at least where I live), the adult friend had a powerful influence on your daughter, you are monitoring the content they share and know Noelle outside of school. I would make sure that your 13 year old understands what she can and cannot share online and fully understands that if an adult asks to be her online friend that she needs to discuss it with you. Your ex, as her parent, has every right to also discuss this with her but needs to understand that this was not a random stranger but a teacher..", "NTA. Noelle is no different to your daughter than any other adult/mentor relationship. Lots of kids follow their teachers on social media. And your Ex is just clueless if he thinks 'relative's' are any safer of a relationship than a former teacher. Does he realize that family friends and relatives are the groups that are most likely interfere in parent's rules or possibly even prey on a child??? They have access and often blind trust. As long as you are monitoring your daughter's socials, there should be no greater risk to her than any other adult relative's socials would have.", "I understand why your daughter wants to have her on her social media, what I don't get is why a 35 year old person would want to have a 13 year old on their personal pages. So I have to agree with your husband. If it was a school account where other children were I could understand it but personal social media? Nope. Not right. Oh, and background checks mean nothing.", "NTA but as a parent I do not think young teens should have unrestricted social media or smart phones.\n\nI know, call me old fashioned.\n\nI can see your ex's concerns but if you trust the woman and her content, she is posting that is your decision as a parent...but he is her parent too so possibly discussions in the future would be in order.", "NTA\n\nHave you spoken to her about online safety since she now has social media accounts? Have you made it a condition of her account that she not exclude you with her privacy settings so you can see at least some of what\u2019s going on?\n\nI\u2019m thinking if your ex continues to freak out one of her friends will shrug and tell her to create an account that you know nothing about, so it\u2019s best to educate and monitor rather than tell her she can\u2019t friend adults. Kids will always figure out a way to avoid the rules their friends don\u2019t have to follow.", "Generally having adults on kids friends lists is creepy but this sounds fine.

At least once a week look over her friends list and make sure she isn't messaging random people. Make sure you know her friends or can confirm they are who she's says. Anne? Oh that's Suzanne Mom.

Seeing how predators work was frightening. He said his kids were the only ones in their HS without smartphones. My 16 yo doesn\u2019t use social media and is no worse for it.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I could understand your ex's concern, he is being unreasonable and it seems to have more to do with control and making you seem like the bad guy. If he has a problem with it then he should address it instead of having you do it. And even then, if it is due to valid concerns, there are other ways to address it, such as you monitoring your daughter's online activity and chats with Noelle. \n\nHowever, your daughter having Noelle as a friend is also valid. She was a person that your daughter trusts and someone that helped her when she was struggling. It's perfectly fine to want to keep in touch with someone who made an impact on her life. You also being friends with Noelle is also a big plus. She isn't some random adult. She is someone you and your daughter know and trust. As long as there are no signs of anything inappropriate happening, there is no harm in your daughter having Noelle on Facebook. The next few years are going to be difficult and your daughter needs a strong support system. Noelle has been a big part of that and to take it away now could damage your daughter. If this is someone you trust then stand your ground for you and your daughter. Of course take precautions and be careful, but do what is best for your daughter and her mental health.
