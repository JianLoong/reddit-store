You planned a month in advance. Charged everyone according to attendance to split the cost of the cabin and food. He waited until the last minute to cancel.

Sorry dude.", "Y\u2019all who said she owes him money were raised by heathens. He committed and she already bought the food. She would have to absorb the cost herself.

I think telling him what your telling us, food is bought, it would come out of your pocket, and seeing how he responds would put you on a better path to correct decision.

Tell him the money was already spent. You will same the leftovers and send them his way.", "NTA.", "NTA he\u2019s stupid. He forfeited the money.", "Exactly what I was going for!", "Well said.  Make him feel that his contribution was a gift.", "Thank you! Wasn\u2019t easy but if it was too expensive people were not interested \ud83d\ude05", "Nope, no reason just \u00ab\u00a0I can\u2019t make it, you can send me the money\u00a0\u00bb I also had the same idea as you! If it\u2019s an emergency or something like that I would GLADLY pay him back but it sounds more like the second option", "I said this weekend before paying for the food that the money will be used and that whoever doesn\u2019t want to come anymore it\u2019s now or never. Nobody said anything", "I can\u2019t imagine people that think it\u2019s not implied no refunds on splitting something that you bail on the last minute.  What did he think she was making a profit between friends?  Most people usually lose money if there organizing a party.  He just not thinking is the truth.", "You expect me to pay for food and a cabin by myself? People knew it would be 15$ each before they came I don\u2019t see a problem", "They were going to and now it\u2019s too late so I pay from my own pokey because I can\u2019t count on him? A week before it would\u2019ve been a different story. It\u2019s last minute that\u2019s why", "He made a commitment to attend and the food and space were booked including him. He could have changed his mind before. Once the food is bought, he has to pay for his share.", "No she wouldn\u2019t. He committed to contribute, she already paid for everything, therefore she would have to eat the cost herself.  Not right.  He needs to just consider it a gift to the birthday recipient.\n\nEdit: spelling", "The food was bought with him in mind. If OP knew he wasn't coming beforehand, she would presumably have bought $15 less food. If she has to pay him back now, he resets back to $0 spent, while she's out an extra $15 of her own money that she wouldn't have spent had she known he was going to cancel last minute. That's not fair to OP.", "Then he should have considered that when he planned to show. If I buy tickets to the theater or a hotel reservation and something comes up, the theater isn't going to give me my money back and hotels have cancellation policies to deal with last-minute cancellations (many doctor's office or even beauty salons charge you for late cancellations). His money is gone, spent. His only real option would have someone go in his stead - essentially selling his \"share\" or \"ticket\" to someone else.", "Planned poorly? I told everyone more than a month in advance wth", "Wait, what!? Can you run me through this logic? She made these arrangements a month ago, detemined cost based on the number of people who RSVP'd, charged accordingly, and now dude wants his money back now that it's been spent. What did OP poorly plan here?", "Was definitely clear", "He committed to it. He left her in a position where she\u2019d have to absorb the cost herself 3 days before.  If he had any class whatsoever, he\u2019d say tell birthday girl I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t make it but enjoy my contribution.  I swear some of y\u2019all were raised by heathens.", "What do expect for $15. She rented a place, got food and it was only $15!  You can\u2019t even go to a movie with that.", "You could also add he can ask the other people for his money back if he wants.  $15 divided by how many people each owe you not just OP.   And there\u2019s a $10 processing fee on any returns.", "I need you to plan my next gathering.", "Is he broke?", "If so, I think you\u2019re fine to keep it. Just explain that and if they get mad well\ud83e\udd37", "Then just remind him he floated into the Never zone.", "I could go either way on this. Sounds like OP was pretty clear though, in which case I agree with you", "OP's poor planning lies in not having a clear cancellation policy. If you invite people and make financial commitments based on their RSVPs, you should have a plan in place for situations like this. It's about basic responsibility. It's not unreasonable for the friend to want his money back, especially with advance notice", "Apparently lmao", "lol, no. They are a group of friends, not businesses. Cancellation policy in this context is hilarious.", "Advanced notice would've been before the cabin and food were paid for. Not 4 days before the party. It's unreasonable to expect that the cabin wouldn't have been paid for by now.", "This is the kind of shit that makes me dislike people and intentionally avoid most of them. \n\n\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t have a clearly stated cancellation policy\u2026\u201d \n\nThere is NO WAY to plan on someone backing out last minute without overcharging everyone in hopes of covering the possibility of someone backing out. Then OP would be an asshole for taking profit on her friend\u2019s birthday. The only way that would work is for OP to front the whole thing and collect even shares at the end. The prepaid fee is how you get people to guarantee their attendance. What do you want more return on your $15 and a party with your friends, or to go do whatever and be out the $15.", "I agree. All my invites come with a terms and services agreement. Shame on op.", "This is not a business.  You give money to someone to pay for non refundable expenses.  That\u2019s a commitment.  Everyone else decide to give money on the plan that everyone agreed to this amount.  What kind of friend puts everyone in this position to pay extra because this guy changed his mind?  Thankfully none of mine.  Even if it was an emergency I wouldn\u2019t ask for $15 back.  That\u2019s insane.", "According to you you\u2019re also too broke to refund him - this is a pretty ugly response to that question.", "YTA you sound like a an AH", "OP should have gotten everyone to sign a contract, with penalty clauses and deposits...\n\n/s", "How is it I just said apparently. Plus I mentionner it in my post. It\u2019s not just about his 15$. If I refund him then I\u2019m signing up to refunding every one who decides to choke last minute, that\u2019s the point. Take a deep breath", "There\u2019s more butt hurt people than I thought here", "You didn\u2019t say \u201capparently\u201d you said \u201capparently LMAO\u201d.
