If anything, they should have been teaching their kid etiquette, that it's never OK to talk loudly enough to disturb others during a live performance or a film. You behaved better than I would have tbh. I would be *furious*. The fact the usher did nothing doesn't make it OK, in fact I would be asking for my money back (I'm sure your tickets weren't cheap).\n\nNTA\n\nJust by the by, the people on stage could probably hear them as well.", "NTA - It is common courtesy, regardless of the venue, to be quiet so that you aren't disturbing those around you. A child may not yet understand this, but for an entire family to be talking throughout the performance is disrespectful to the dancers, the other patrons, and to you. Asking them to keep it down was completely reasonable. It\u2019s unfortunate that the parents failed to explain this to their child and took offense to being reprimanded rather than apologizing.", "NTA - manners would indicate that one should be quiet during a performance, no matter what type it is. It's one thing to quietly explain what's going on, but for it to have happened through the entire performance? That's a bit much. The thing with most ballets (as far as I know) the stories haven't changed, and if someone perhaps had explained to the child BEFORE the show what he plot of it was, it might have gone better, instead of talking through the entire thing.\n\nThe kicking of your seat - that was just rude AF.", "NTA. Theater etiquette is very much still a thing and the usher didn't do their job by not intervening.", "NTA. It\u2019s an unfortunate truth but too many people have somehow lost the idea that they should be considerate of others, especially in public or at a movie, show, performance. It\u2019s disrespectful of the people around you and disrespectful to the performers. \n\nTo be frank, I hate a couple of things about this scenario. One, the fact that there was a child in their group is not an excuse to be rude. It does not give them permission to disrupt others. That child\u2019s experience does not trump yours.\n\nFurther, though, I would argue that they are doing the child a disservice in several ways. They\u2019re not teaching her correct audience member etiquette, firstly. She\u2019s going to grow up thinking it\u2019s fine to talk in a theater. Second, I would also argue they\u2019re the ones ruining her \u201cfirst time at the ballet\u201d by jabbering at her the whole time. Just let her watch and absorb. Let her listen and think and hear on her own. Part of the magic of live performances, and ballet certainly, is getting drawn into the magic. She can\u2019t do that with everyone yapping away at her. Just let her watch and answer questions and talk later. \n\nFwiw, I\u2019d suggest that you contact the venue. Not just to get a refund, but also to let them know they need to address that the staff on duty did not handle things appropriately.", "NTA. Even if it WAS a kid, you can let the kid learn from watching. They don\u2019t need a play-by-play.", "NTA - one of the first things I go over in my drama class is theatre etiquette. I've done field trips to professional and amateur shows with various age groups. It's not hard to explain to a kid - especially when the adults out number the kids ratio wise - that now is not the time to talk.\n\nA quiet word here or there happens with certain ages and can be forgiven in certain circumstances. However, to have a full blown conversation throughout the show is ridiculous. I've told off other people in theatres over the years. I didn't pay to hear them, I paid to hear the people onstage or in the orchestra.", "NTA you can\u2019t talk like that during a performance or show of any kind. You can\u2019t talk like that during a magic act it\u2019s just rude to the people around you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if they won't give you your money back, maybe they'll offer free or discounted tickets to another performance.\n\nYou would be surprised what you can hear from the stage, even with music blaring. Depends on the build of the theater of course, but there have been times when I've been on stage when I could hear people in the audience \\*whispering\\* even while the orchestra was playing. Acoustics are weird in some of those venues.", "NTA.
