A house that is across the street and very comparable to mine ended up selling 3 months later for $35k more than what I bought my house for.\n\nApparently then new owners wanted to buy that house, saw what my comp house sold for, and just knocked on the door and made the old owners an above market offer and it worked.", "NTA.
