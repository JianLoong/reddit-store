Trying to pass off responsibility and assume it will be accepted is not only rude, but ridiculous. \n\nYour niece has made her fair share of poor decisions,  like a lot of teens do. But the adults in her life, while being the ones who should be providing guidance and helping her mature into a more responsible young woman, seem to only be reinforcing more negative behaviors - like entitlement, for one. \n\nIt's unfortunate that she doesn't have stronger, better examples to follow, and that her child will likely follow suit because of her environment. \n\nYou are 100% NTA.", "NTA.\n\nLike you said, not your baby, not your responsibility.

Throwing your fertility issues in your face?! That reason enough to go low contact with all of them for a few months.

Can you go LC or NC with them until they realize what kind of life they will have with the decision that they all made together.
