I helped him, making a simplified version of what I would have done for myself, and he delivered it.\n\nMonths later he asked for my help again, for the same kind of thing.

Turns out, he had sold his managers the idea that he was an excel expert, and was expecting me to \"pitch in\" whenever his job would require a new spreadsheet.", "NTA. If he can't put together a PP presentation, perhaps he needs a job where he won't need one. I'm with you: if he would have bothered to try before asking, then sure.", "INFO - does he do this often?", "NTA it's his responsibility", "NTA. It was okay for him to ask for help, it was okay for you to say no, but it wasn't okay for him to get furious. \n\nI see where you're coming from - sometimes people ask for help before they've put any effort in and it feels like they're just trying to avoid work. I probably wouldn't assume that without more evidence, but you didn't say no outright, you just asked for him to begin the process and get invested before you stepped in. You were willing to compromise and communicate, and he was not and shut down on you.", "NTA - Are you applying for the job or is he?", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t either, mostly because how am I supposed to know what he wants to present on for HIS interview? If they\u2019re asking for slides for a presentation there\u2019s a good chance this job will require it often, and he needs to get used to it.", "NTA, can't he do his own presentation? He's not a 9yrs old.", "Nta you going to do his job for him too?", "NTA with this particular thing - he needs to do the work himself and offering to proof read it was the right suggestion - but for goodness' sake,  how you might treat your future *children* should not be the yardstick for how you treat your partner.", "NTA. He hasn\u2019t done any work and expects you to swoop in and save him. His laziness doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency on your part.", "NTA. I think your offer to proofread is perfect. If he can't do the job they're asking him to do, is he just planning on *you* doing his job forever? Hell no.", "NTA. You need not be doing his work for him. Furthermore, PowerPoint is not difficult to do at the basic level. The application even has step by step templates to get you started. \n\nWhy do I think this guy probably got lots of help with his homework assignments as well?\n\nHe needs to put on his big boy pants.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s coming off a bit lazy. He needs to put at least something together first.\n\nJust asking to to create the PP is a bit crazy, if he had just left it after that then whatever, but the fact he got some angry makes it even worse.", "NTA. He might have to do PowerPoint presentation as part of his job, so he needs to figure it out.", "I feel like there is some missing info here. Do you consider him lazy in general? Does he ask for your help on all things and then expect you to shoulder the most work?", "INFO: Instead of going with your feeling about what he wants, why didn't you ask \"What do you need help on?\" Maybe he just needed someone to talk it out with. Is this a pattern of behavior?", "ESH\n\nJesus. He shouldn\u2019t have been so pushy but you could have just ask him to show you what he has and what his problem is. Sometimes it\u2019s just a matter of talking things through. \n\nUnless he tends to dump his job on you and expects you to do it for him, you were being difficult for no reason.", "ESH. One of the dumbest fights I've seen on here. He shouldn't have been so forceful, but you should have offered to help a bit if he doesn't have good powerpoint skills. Are you afraid of him not getting an A on his job interview for plagiarism?", "YTA. It isn't your kids it's your husband and he's asking you for help. This isn't the same as a child trying to trick you into doing their homework for them \ud83e\udd23\n\nInstead of just assuming he wants to kick back while you do all the work, why don't you at least try to help him first prior to assuming?\n\nI don't feel it's that absurd to ask your spouse for help with something if they understand it a lot better than you do. That being said you're right that it falls under the category of \"can't you just google it?\" but when people do that I politely remind them about that and I still at least try to do a quick search myself. How much effort did that take me an extra 30 seconds of my time?\n\nIdk, to me it just seems pretty especially when it's your spouse.", "NTA but I feel like you could have maybe asked what he actually wanted you to do rather than answer based on an assumption. You are not an AH for refusing either way though.", "I am going with BDA. You are on the same team, not against each other. You also do not need to treat him like a child.", "It sounds like ESH.", "Well I don't see why not help him, he's not your child and that's not a school presentation. I'll say YTA", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s in your interest for your husband to get a better job isn\u2019t it?", "YTA. He\u2019s your husband so he\u2019s going to ask you for help before anyone else. You shouldn\u2019t compare your interactions with him to your interactions with your future kids because it\u2019s completely different, he\u2019s not a child. For example, some people are just no good with stuff like PowerPoint etc, so instead of showing him that there are already available templates to choose from so he can begin typing things up, you\u2019ve made things more difficult for him by sending him to google for it. Using PowerPoint or computers may not even be part of the job description, so there\u2019s no harm in showing him how to use PowerPoint so he can carry on with his presentation. Sometimes it\u2019s good to just help out your spouse instead of whining on reddit, especially for such a simple easy fix that most likely would be resolved for good after showing him once.", "YTA, marriage is team work.", "YTA. Is he your husband or \u201cfuture\u201d kid?  It seems like you\u2019d rather be him mom. Does he also need to finish his peas before he gets dessert?  Be thankful he cares about your opinion enough to use it in his professional life.

Who cares if OPs husband learns to use PowerPoint (or anything else) from her rather than by himself? It's hardly relevant how easy PowerPoint is *to you*. Clearly he's either having trouble already or going to.\n\nSome people learn more easily by being taught by others. \n\nMaybe you're like a 160 IQ genius and awesome at learning stuff on your own. That's great for you. OPs husband obviously wants help. Up till this point anything else is an assumption because she didn't even offer to try.\n\nHad she gone to help him and right away it was clear he didn't want to do anything I'd say NTA. That isn't what happened though. Honestly though it's totally irrelevant how easy/hard PowerPoint is, if it's so easy then it'll only take OP max 5 minutes to show him what to do.

I put myself in the same position and I'd help, but I wouldn't do it for him.

She\u2019s not his teacher or his mom. There\u2019s free classes online. There\u2019s paid classes pretty much everywhere. Why is he demanding that his wife carry his workload along with hers?
