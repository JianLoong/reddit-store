I eventually figured out that he was paralyzed my decision making and figuring out how to do anything on his own because his mom/family had literally just done everything (including his homework!) for him all under the label of \u201chelping him\u201d. We had to have a lot of discussions around how he had to get comfortable using the skills he has (you can Google and figure things for your job out if you\u2019re capable of doing it for your hobby or favorite tv show) to try to sort himself out before he started asking to be told how to do something before even trying. These were coupled with discussions around boundaries around my time\u2014he would be engaged that I wouldn\u2019t just drop whatever I was doing because he showed up in my office and wants help on his thing that second. He would make manipulative comments about how he would never ask for my help again since he was such a burden. And for real: the silent treatment is a manipulative tactic used by children who do not know how to communicate about their insecurities. If any of this sounds familiar, I really suggest behavioral therapy for him so he learns how to manage his professional life, feel comfortable gaining new skills and advocating for himself as an adult.", "I agree with you up to a point, I too would want to use my skills to help my partner and expect him to help me too but there\u2019s a big difference between helping and doing it for them and the latter doesn\u2019t help in the long run, it just sets them up for failure later. \n\nMy other half is awesome at excel, excel is my arch nemesis but if I ask him for help it\u2019s always \u2018this is what I need to do or what I want to achieve, can you show me how\u2019 and I\u2019ll scribble myself an idiot guide for the next time I need to do it and I might ask him to check my work when I\u2019ve had a go myself. The last thing I would want is for him to do it for me without learning myself cus next time the boss decides he needs something similar fast and my hubby ain\u2019t about, I\u2019m gonna be screwed and look stupid. \n\nI think OP would have responded completely differently if he had said \u2018I need to do a presentation for my interview on this topic, these are the key areas im gonna be talking about and these are the really important points I need to get across but I have no idea how to make this look awesome on the slides, can you show me how to do x or I\u2019ve done this but it looks a bit rubbish, how would you make it better and can you show me how to do that\u2019. Asking her to do it completely for him is not helping him. It would be a miracle if he passed the interview using content not designed by him, you can spot it a mile off when people present work that\u2019s not there\u2019s and if he somehow managed to get the job he\u2019s gonna fall flat on his face when they expect him to be able to do it day in day out and he can\u2019t, then he\u2019s just gonna get fired.

If he asked me to do what OP asked his partner to do, I'd say no too.  \n\nI'm not saying there is a pattern of incompetence, but he is clearly applying for a job that he's not ready for.

I feel like her reaction was a \u201cfool me once\u201d kind of thing. Plus if he needs help, is he even qualified for the job?", "I had the same thought. Giving OP the benefit of the doubt, it sounds like her husband has a history of lazily delegating tasks to her and she's fed up with it.

OP's inability to fully articulate the scenario doesn't lend confidence in her credibility as a narrator. \n\nIf something as benign as helping your partner with a work project sends you over the rails, not only is she unhinged, but she might need to reevaluate her relationship altogether.

You'd be surprised (or maybe not) how many people just clearly don't try at all.
