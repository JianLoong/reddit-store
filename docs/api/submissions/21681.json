Masturbation is a natural thing but most folks want *privacy* and, when male, don\u2019t moan and beat the meat two feet from their sister.", "Definitely NTA, at that age every man needs to understand that there\u2019s places where they can and cannot masturbate at. The fact that he felt \u201ccomfortable\u201d enough to do it next to you is a **HUGE RED FLAG** that needs to be addressed immediately. \n\nI was reading the comment you said earlier where he made noises to pretend having fake sex, that is definitely not ok either. Find out what\u2019s going on in creating this hyper-sexualized behavior as well as try to likely distance himself more from porn for a bit. It\u2019s normal to masturbate but being this desperate or acting like this is not normal and I feel it\u2019s important that a talk\u2019s goes on with your brother about what he\u2019s been doing \n\nEven if it\u2019s a just an accident, it\u2019s still important to teach him the boundaries and that he simply cannot masturbate when someone else is the room and it needs to be alone and private", "NTA that is extremely digusting and concerning behaivor imo. He literally got off while his own sister is sleeping centimeters away from him? And the fact your mum tried to play it off because \"its natural\" like what?? It its thst urgent he can go to a goddamn bathroom! I would refuse  to sleep in the same room as him ever again", "NTA if your brother cant stop being pornsick for your short vacation he needs help", "i don't trust that he felt \"comfortable\" enough to do that next to you. has he done anything perverse towards/around you before? is this the first time he's done anything like it?", "NTA, but I have a feeling your brother has a severe porn addiction. You need address that before he does something that will never be forgotten/forgiven. My man\u2019s is in delusion, save his stupid ass from destroying his own life.", "NTA, this is very weird nasty behavior..I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt's very suspicious of him masturbating whilst you're literally nearby. Possible signs of porn addiction and mind clouded with delusion.", "Im crying", "NTA.  Your mom needs to have a conversation about appropriate times and places to do such.\n\nHe should have taken it to the bathroom.", "I had a really fucked up family that would do weird shit like this, and it's just so uncomfortable.

Nta", "NTA. That\u2019s very weird and as \u201cnatural\u201d as it is, he shouldn\u2019t be doing it right next to you and your mom should definitely talk with him about it", "Hi therapist here,  it is \"natural\" but does not mean it is socially acceptable to tug on ones memeber when another person is in the room, hes only 14 an unaware of boundaries hopefully but with the comments being made prior to the action the brother might not fully understand. Are you the ass hole? Hell no if anything the mother should have addressed this an explained that isnt approite behavior when someone is in the room \"dont embarrass him\" no i say fuxk that you keep your boundaries an if he keeps that behavior up when sharing the same room again call him out on it an embarrass him that is shameful an its appropriate to shame this action in this nature. Now if he was alone taken care of it thats different an shouldnt be shamed but no shame ur bro if this happens again.", "Nta. Thats vile. Even if it's natural your his sister.

B the brother is young only 14 is unaware of boundaries an someone needs to correct his actions.
