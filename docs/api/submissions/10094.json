Even before dating exclusively you were helping him out with bills, and he stubbornly wants you to move into his studio apartment instead something more practical.

Follow your gut and tell him your not doing it!", "NTA, and if your plants are really important to you seriously reconsider moving in with anyone with cats. 4 months is awfully soon to be pushing that hard to move in together, especially when it's not enough room for you both to function.", "NTA it\u2019s too early in the relationship to make these kinds of demands anyway.

You know what you need to be happy, and it's very reasonable--enough space to live and work (including wfh), and your plants.\n\nDo not give that up when it's not absolutely necessary. As you already know, you would be unhappy.\n\nAlso, him pushing this hard this early in a relationship is a HUGE red flag. Even if you were totally great with the space and everything could work well (again, this WILL NOT work out well), one person pushing this hard to move into HIS space (not even yours, which in this case would be objectively better) is throwing all the awful signs that people look back on when they go through a miserable breakup and say, \"Oh, yeah, I should've known how bad this would be.\"\n\nDefinitely don't move into his tiny place ever.

His one roomer is enough space for him, I'm not surprised it would be tight to add a whole extra person in there.

I don't think I would do that either.\n\n>He asked me what is more more important to me between making this work with him or having space.\n\nI suspect he's more concerned about money, than either of those things.

Even taking a phone call would be a challenge coz you'd disturb your SO while they are working. \n\nNow add 25 plants and 3!!! Cats. Mind you, I've lived with cats for quite some time and they don't really mix with plants. You'd be constantly cleaniy tipped over pots, shush them from eating leaves and what not.

You bd if meh just for this.", "It's too soon to be moving in with each other at this point. He can't grasp the simple concept of space, and the amount of it that 2 adults need, especially when you both are working from home.  Imo this is a control issue.

I would just walk away,  Before you make the mistake of moving in together, or god forbid getting married.", "NTA.

He should not be that comfortable with you spending your money on his household, when he doesn't do the same. \n\nYou will be less important as his pets. \n\nHis cats will eat/destroy your plants, if you will be allowed to take them to your place.\n\nI don't know if the cats eat from their bowls, but i've seen some people eating from the same plate with their pets and that's not something i would like to do.\n\nI would not like to hide in the bathroom to work from home because of the noise or his cats being all over me.\n\nI don't know what his cleaning habits are, but as i see it, you'll be in charge with all the cleaning and probably cooking. \n\nThe worst possible cleaning thing you will have to do is cleaning the litter box(es). \n\nHave you done this before? Do you know what it means? Are you comfortable doing it? \n\nAlso, i wonder if you talked about how will you be splitting finances, what are his expenses and what does he expects you to do/buy/pay. \n\nEven the cats might be an expense you didn't took into consideration. \n\nI have 1 cat and he eats 1 expensive dry type of food and another moist expensive also type of food (different brand). Plus the sand. It comes up to 200$, which is something. I tried all other brands and he simply refuses to eat so i had to accept my faith :)). \n\nI hope you will think about it but from what i saw, you 2 aren't a good match.", "Please start a GoFundMe for condoms asap", "NTA but would pick one room the efficiency is just so much better", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not practical or logical to move out of a 2 room into 1 room unless money is an issue and that doesn't sound like you do but maybe your bf does.
