And that you didn\u2019t see this as a neon sign to RUN from this person also shows that you are vulnerable to all sorts of abuse and that is why he is so very keen on locking you in. \n\nI think you should go and see a therapist and tell them about this relationship and get some advice on how to sort your life out to the point where you wouldn\u2019t let someone take advantage of you in this way.\n\nI speak from experience, unfortunately. This guy is not someone you should move in with. He is bad news and he will not make you happy. Please don\u2019t do this to yourself.

Because of how you describe appartement sizes and you said metro instead of subway, there's a chance we live in the same city. A 1 1/2 is generally a 1 person appartement.

He's being ridiculous if he thinks you valuing space means you don't care about the relationship.

If so he can move back and it doesn't have to mean a break-up.\n\nI will say that him \"hating\" your larger, more convenient apartment is a bit of a red flag.
