While *putonghua*^(2), standardized Chinese was also based off of the Beijing dialect it is not a direct descendant of *guanhua*.\n\nMandarin can also be used as a general term for the collection of northern dialects, as one of the seven major dialectical groups.\n\nAll that aside, it is perfectly fine to refer to any Sinitic language/Chinese dialect as Chinese.\n\n^(1: In China the term \"dialect\" or) *^(fangyan)* ^(is preferred.

I'm curious now for why they would choose a Portuguese word for \"Chinese bureaucrat\" for the language.", ">all Chinese people don\u2019t just speak \u201cChinese\u201d\n\nThat's an incorrect statement. All the people from China that speak their local languages speak \"Chinese\". Being a specific dialect doesn't make it any less Chinese, as all the people from China on this thread point out.", "I like it too.\n\nThey probably come from the same root word.\n\nE.g. fen\u00eatre in French, fenster in German and ffenestr in Welsh, and yet the word is window in English.\n\nThe French, German and Welsh word come from the Latin fenestra, but the English word comes from the Old Norse word vindauga.\n\nI know, I know, I\u2019m a nerd, but I genuinely find this fascinating.", "No, I know, what\u2019s why I put it in quotation marks. I\u2019m trying, but I think doing a poor job of it, to distinguish between speaking a Chinese language or dialect and calling it Chinese as opposed to not knowing that Mandarin, Cantonese and various other languages and dialects etc even exist.", "Suddenly, the word defenestrate makes sense.", "If you want to be extra fascinated, there\u2019s the English word defenestration, meaning to throw someone out of a window, which does come from the Latin fenestra."]}
