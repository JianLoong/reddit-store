This made it difficult for people from distant regions to communicate effectively. To solve this issue officials learned a second language, *guanhua,* to communicate with each other. When Jesuit missionaries came to China, this was the first version of Chinese they encountered. They named it \"Mandarin\" after the Portuguese word for \"official\" or \"minister\".\n\nThis *guanhua* however is not even the \"Mandarin\" people generally refer to. While *putonghua*^(2), standardized Chinese was also based off of the Beijing dialect it is not a direct descendant of *guanhua*.\n\nMandarin can also be used as a general term for the collection of northern dialects, as one of the seven major dialectical groups.\n\nAll that aside, it is perfectly fine to refer to any Sinitic language/Chinese dialect as Chinese.\n\n^(1: In China the term \"dialect\" or) *^(fangyan)* ^(is preferred. The reason why they are considered dialects is mostly political because it supports the notion of a unified Chinese identity. The joke is that a language is just a dialect with a navy.)\n\n^(2: Literally \"common talk\", compared to) *^(fangyan)* ^(\"regional speech\".

Most people in America cannot differentiate between Mandarin and Cantonese, and most people in America would feel rather insecure about trying to do so in front of someone else.\n\nFor the record, I do think your friend is TA. It's pretty ludicrous to claim that using the word \"Chinese\" is a microaggression while you're sitting in a restaurant that markets itself as...Chinese.\n\nYour friend is either so chronically online that she's forgotten how normal people communicate, or she is purposely trying to start a fight because she isn't interested in retaining you as a friend. Either way, I wouldn't be particularly interested in keeping the friendship. The fact that she's interrupting professors to try to \"win\" on this is *insane*, and shows the fundamental lack of respect she has for other people.", "NTA - there are like 7 or 8 dialects spoken in China, though Mandarin is the most spoken.

While Mandarin is the official language of mainland China, Cantonese is the official language of Hong Kong. Most expat communities in the West are founded by Cantonese speakers (because it was far easier to emigrate from Hong Kong under British rule than from China under the CCP).

The writing system is *Chinese* characters. Spoken language is Mandarin or Cantonese. I work in a field where we need translators a lot. Someone telling me I need to get a \"Chinese\" translator for an interview drives me up the wall because we need exact dialects to get the right language speaker on the phone.

Saying they are specifically Mandarin is unbelievably dumb.", "If you start looking hard enough, you'll find that _a lot_ of countries have or had similar situations to China and Chinese/Mandarin/Cantonese/etc. \n\nLook, for example, at the Wikipedia page for the [languages of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Italy). One particular language (Florentine from Tuscan) has been adopted as the official \"Italian\" language of the country, but there are several distinct languages in the country, which can be mutually comprehensible to speakers of standard Italian, but are none the less seperate languages.", "And even then, all of the many Chinese coworkers I have had over the years have referred to themselves and their language as \"Chinese\" regardless of where they were actually from (mainland or Taiwan) or which dialect they were speaking (unless there was a specific reason to make the distinction--which given the varied conversations we had, did come up occasionally).  Likewise, written Chinese is similar to a number of other Asian scripts in their older forms (I work with scholars, we have had a lot of conversations about the similarities/differences in Asian languages/dialects/written forms along with their origins/history/etc).\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "> Layla might have had a point if you were talking about spoken languages\n\nNot really. \"Chinese\" would have been unspecific, but that doesn't make it wrong.

It's a language with many dialects.", "South Korea as well, though not so much in daily life.", "I think it's even closer than that.  I don't speak/read myself, but I've been in Japan with a Chinese colleague, and she could read things in kanji.  She had to work at it, but could manage.   Even as a native English speaker, I'd have no chance reading a Scandinavian language.", "France as well. In mid-19th century France, less than 20% of the population spoke what we would consider French today.", "That's why I added the qualifier that I don't know, either. Now, my understanding is that Mandarin used simplified and Cantonese used traditional characters with some unique elements, so I imagine that lots of people who are familiar with one or the other could probably identify the differences with some ease.", "Yeah I agree with you. I guess it depends on where it comes from - some people genuinely don\u2019t know that there are dialects in China and that all Chinese people don\u2019t just speak \u201cChinese\u201d as opposed to Standard Chinese or any number of other dialects or languages.\n\nSo I can understand wanting address what could be assumed to be a misconception.", ">That's why I added the qualifier that I don't know, either.\n\nThe problem is more that the complaining girl didn't know but still thought she should be able to pass judgement.\n\n>Now, my understanding is that Mandarin used simplified and Cantonese used traditional characters with some unique elements, so I imagine that lots of people who are familiar with one or the other could probably identify the differences with some ease.\n\nAs a non native-speaker, I'd say it depends on the character. But generally, probably, but I don't know for sure. The younger generations, if they only learn simplified, might have trouble. Technically the previous version of Chinese Characters are also already simplified characters compared even older ones.", ">So I can understand wanting address what could be assumed to be a misconception.\n\nSure, but I have majored in Japanese Studies (which included Classical Japanese) and minored in Chinese Studies.\n\nAnd as I very much did not focus on the linguistic details and would therefore have trouble having a real discussion about the differences dialect/language, and what not, I could follow such a discussion, at best.\n\nI don't think people going to a chinese restaurant to eat should have to be able to be held to the standard of linguists, is all I'm saying.\n\nEspecially when the misconception was the girl's who complained, not OP. If she wants to be the language police she better be right."]}
