I speak only English and my parents immigrated here from Nigeria so it is linguistically unfamiliar to me.

I believe people are going to speak up soon because Layla's antics have disrupted lectures and presentations. We have Chinese acquaintances who haven't said much aside from not understanding what the exact issue is.

As a Chinese person - the characters are Chinese characters.

Most dialects can use the same characters.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend is a virtue signalling asshole. Get better friends.", "NTA but your friend is", "NTA\n\nThe history of the word \"Mandarin\" is interesting. China has a vast number of dialects/languages^(1). This made it difficult for people from distant regions to communicate effectively. To solve this issue officials learned a second language, *guanhua,* to communicate with each other. When Jesuit missionaries came to China, this was the first version of Chinese they encountered. They named it \"Mandarin\" after the Portuguese word for \"official\" or \"minister\".\n\nThis *guanhua* however is not even the \"Mandarin\" people generally refer to. While *putonghua*^(2), standardized Chinese was also based off of the Beijing dialect it is not a direct descendant of *guanhua*.\n\nMandarin can also be used as a general term for the collection of northern dialects, as one of the seven major dialectical groups.\n\nAll that aside, it is perfectly fine to refer to any Sinitic language/Chinese dialect as Chinese.\n\n^(1: In China the term \"dialect\" or) *^(fangyan)* ^(is preferred. The reason why they are considered dialects is mostly political because it supports the notion of a unified Chinese identity. The joke is that a language is just a dialect with a navy.)\n\n^(2: Literally \"common talk\", compared to) *^(fangyan)* ^(\"regional speech\". In Taiwan the term) *^(guoyu)* ^(is used, \"national language\". It is mostly the same, although there are some differences in vocabulary.)", "NTA and Layla sounds like an absolute piece of work holy hell\u2026", "NTA. I've been to China before and most of the people I encountered there referred to the language simply as Chinese and did not distinguish between the two dialects. I wouldn't apologise either\n\nI'm sure you don't go around expecting everyone to be aware that there are over 200 languages/dialects in Nigeria and simply correct people when they make the common mistake of thinking there is a Nigerian language as its unlikely that people outside of that cultural orbit are aware of this. I think not being able to differentiate between 2 dialects is very understandable and not a microagression at all.", "NTA and Layla needs to set down her virtue-signaling flag", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong. She doesn't know wtf she is talking about.", "NTA Layla is microaggressive about everything because she thinks it gives her power.  She in fact is the aggressor here.", "NTA, because you were talking about written Chinese. Layla might have had a point if you were talking about spoken languages, but that's not what happened: you were specifically talking about an object written in Chinese script.", "NTA. You tried to be as inclusive as possible. Most people in America cannot differentiate between Mandarin and Cantonese, and most people in America would feel rather insecure about trying to do so in front of someone else.\n\nFor the record, I do think your friend is TA. It's pretty ludicrous to claim that using the word \"Chinese\" is a microaggression while you're sitting in a restaurant that markets itself as...Chinese.\n\nYour friend is either so chronically online that she's forgotten how normal people communicate, or she is purposely trying to start a fight because she isn't interested in retaining you as a friend. Either way, I wouldn't be particularly interested in keeping the friendship. The fact that she's interrupting professors to try to \"win\" on this is *insane*, and shows the fundamental lack of respect she has for other people.", "NTA - there are like 7 or 8 dialects spoken in China, though Mandarin is the most spoken. Your friend is being way too sensitive.", "NTA. It does come off a bit \u201cignorant\u201d (like saying \u201cI wish I could speak American\u201d,) but when you clarified you knew that \u201cChinese\u201d is not a language but you weren\u2019t sure which language it was, she should have let it go. It\u2019s honestly not that big a deal, it\u2019s clear what you meant and that you weren\u2019t being offensive.", "It sounds like Layla is microagressing by assuming it's Mandarin and not another dialect.

Anyone, who's making you walk on eggshells around them, is the real TH.", "NTA. Your friend is though. She\u2019s taking this whole thing to an unnecessary level. I\u2019d suggest not being friends with her anymore if she wants to act like this over a technicality.", "NTA, but is Layla of Chinese descent?", "NTA. Yeah the girl is being ridiculous. All it takes is for one to Google the writing differences between Mandarin and Cantonese. It explains, to keep things easy, that the writing is either Chinese or simplified Chinese.", "NTA - The characters are the same for Mandarin and other Chinese language/dialects (or extremely similar). In fact, if you look on the internet they are \"Chinese characters.\" There was no malice or lazy racism behind your comment.

While Mandarin is the official language of mainland China, Cantonese is the official language of Hong Kong.
