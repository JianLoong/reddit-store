We have Chinese acquaintances who haven't said much aside from understanding the exact issue. Yesterday, Layla asked our race inclusivity professor if someone \"for example\" said Chinese instead of Mandarin was an example of racism.

I want the drama to end.\n\nAITA for saying Chinese instead of Mandarin when I wasn't sure of which dialect?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Layla and I are NOT friends. She thinks we are because I'm a black person in her vicinity. I don't invite her over or hang out with her, I play nice because our industry is small but everyone else knows I do not like her. Last school year she tried to correct me on my own culture and I have since avoided talking to her. She is a white international student from Colombia, so I thought there might be some miscommunication in this situation. Still, she has been malicious towards me since day 1 so I doubt that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: I can't reply to comments for some reason but to answer some questions:\n\n\\-Layla is 0% Chinese. I know this because she brags about being 5% black and 95% Italian. If she was any part Asian, she would not let me hear the end of it\n\n\\-The professor she asked said \"that's a weird thing to ask right now, but it depends on context\" and moved on. We were discussing diversity in Asian media so I think he took it as her virtue signaling.\n\n\\-My friends don't like \"gossiping\" so when I tried to talk with them about it, they cut me off saying they don't want to gossip about a friend. Whenever Layla is around or wants to see me, a few agreed to act as a buffer and for the most part, they do that.

This made it difficult for people from distant regions to communicate effectively. To solve this issue officials learned a second language, *guanhua,* to communicate with each other. When Jesuit missionaries came to China, this was the first version of Chinese they encountered. They named it \"Mandarin\" after the Portuguese word for \"official\" or \"minister\".\n\nThis *guanhua* however is not even the \"Mandarin\" people generally refer to. While *putonghua*^(2), standardized Chinese was also based off of the Beijing dialect it is not a direct descendant of *guanhua*.\n\nMandarin can also be used as a general term for the collection of northern dialects, as one of the seven major dialectical groups.\n\nAll that aside, it is perfectly fine to refer to any Sinitic language/Chinese dialect as Chinese.\n\n^(1: In China the term \"dialect\" or) *^(fangyan)* ^(is preferred. The reason why they are considered dialects is mostly political because it supports the notion of a unified Chinese identity. The joke is that a language is just a dialect with a navy.)\n\n^(2: Literally \"common talk\", compared to) *^(fangyan)* ^(\"regional speech\".

There are big arguments about whether the spoken dialects are 'dialects' or languages in their own right.\n\nBut using the term Chinese is common, correct, and standard for people of Chinese descent and culture.

It is a unified writing system, in that literate Chinese people (~97%) can see a character and know what it means, and the vast majority of people can understand written sentence structures, so in that way Chinese writing is common across people who speak different dialects. But the weird part here is that just because the meaning is understood, doesn't mean the characters are able to be read in the dialect. Chinese dialects aren't just different pronunciations or words having different meanings (pop vs soda vs coke)-- the pronunciation and word order and number of syllables for a word can be *entirely different*, or include sounds that don't exist in Mandarin/Cantonese, or entire phrases that aren't translatable to written characters. One of the dialects I speak is Shanghainese-- for example, the mandarin word for \"at\" or [verb]-ing is \u5728, pronounced \"zai\"-- in shanghainese this is something approximately like \"lei le gei\". Shanghainese also has a ton of \"v\" consonants, which doesn't even exist in mandarin. When people \"write\" shanghainese, they use homophones in mandarin to approximate the sounds, but to any non-shanghainese speaker they'd just be a random string of characters without meaning. Even shanghainese people probably can't read it easily because the homophones can't even capture the sounds correctly (e.g. no \"v\" sound available in mandarin) and there's no standardized characters for specific sounds. The other dialect my family speaks is wenzhounese, which is even further away from mandarin lol-- completely unintelligible.\n\nI guess it's kind of like.. if all romance languages could see written latin and understand it? But once they speak the meaning out loud (in french, italian, etc), it no longer matches what's on the page. And then the spoken sound can't be written down because there's no alphabet or standardized pronunciation-to-text conversion.", "tbh I love that there's an entire word for throwing someone out a window.

My point still stands, as is my point of just admitting when you don't know. \n\nAlso Taiwanese is not one of the indigenous languages in the way you're thinking. Taiwanese originates from Hokkien, a Chinese dialect, but is native to Taiwan after many decades of being used in Taiwan and becoming a dialect of its own (due to the history of migration of Hokkien-speaking people from China to Taiwan for generations before the KMT party and others came to Taiwan and instituted Mandarin as the official language).
