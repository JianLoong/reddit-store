I said she needs to never allow him in the house/apartment again.

They aren't meant to be real locks, and are designed to still be able to be opened from the outside with just a minor bit of extra effort.  AKA: getting a rod and poking it into the hole.\n\nThis is for safety reasons.  In case people have accidents or medical emergencies and can't unlock the doors from the inside.\n\nThat is why it would be a bad idea to block the door the the bathroom with a rubber stopper or install a real lock (as I have seen some other comments suggest).  That is especially a safety concern in the bathroom, where a large number of home accidents occur.\n\nBut as I said, the OP is NTA, and she should definitely ban her roommate's friend from the house due to his inappropriate behavior.  That is a much better and safer way to deal with the situation.", "Not technically, no.\n\nMy house has little keys for the internal doors. As the comment above you says, you don\u2019t actually need that specific key to open the door, but it\u2019s analogous to a real key.
