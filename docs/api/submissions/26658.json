I'd get a padlock he can't pick for your door. He's not someone who respects boundaries.", "This friend's behavior is unacceptable and he can't respect simple boundaries.

The bathroom and your room are the 2 places you are literately your most exposed. Sweep your room for any devices and consider buying a room camera for safety. Don't back down with your roommates either, each of you deserves a safe space to dwell and him garnering sympathy shouldn't even be a consideration after the behavior displayed.", "Absolutely NTA!  Once he picked the lock and entered the bathroom when you were showering, you had every reason to kick him out.

This guy is so creepy. If you can, try and find another place to live but I know the rental market in many places sucks so may not be possible. Get a deadbolt for your room and a camera. \n\nI\u2019d also have your room and bathroom checked for any hidden cameras he may have left as he sounds creepy enough to do something that horrible.
