I said she needs to never allow him in the house/apartment again.

They aren't meant to be real locks, and are designed to still be able to be opened from the outside with just a minor bit of extra effort.  AKA: getting a rod and poking it into the hole.\n\nThis is for safety reasons.  In case people have accidents or medical emergencies and can't unlock the doors from the inside.\n\nThat is why it would be a bad idea to block the door the the bathroom with a rubber stopper or install a real lock (as I have seen some other comments suggest).  That is especially a safety concern in the bathroom, where a large number of home accidents occur.\n\nBut as I said, the OP is NTA, and she should definitely ban her roommate's friend from the house due to his inappropriate behavior.  That is a much better and safer way to deal with the situation.", "Not technically, no.\n\nMy house has little keys for the internal doors. As the comment above you says, you don\u2019t actually need that specific key to open the door, but it\u2019s analogous to a real key. When you have not been given a key and you have been specifically told not to enter a locked door, finding a way to unlock the door and enter it is a dick move whether or not you are technically engaging in lock picking.", "Was just about to suggest this, it's highly likely given what else he's done.", "Yeah, I was just pointing out that it\u2019s not lockpicking.

Calling it lockpicking gives a little credit where none at all is due.", ">One time while I was showering he wanted to use the bathroom. I told him to wait. He picked the lock on the door and I didn't realize until I heard him peeing WHILE i was showering.\n\nNTA. How in the actual fuck can anyone be on his side after this happened!!!!?", "Please please please please protect yourself, I can't stress this enough but I would be terrified. This guy is in your home, he can pick locks and he already sexually harassed you once. I don't even want to say this, but he could do so much worse. Please you have to protect yourself. Tell your roommates, tell the landlord, anything you can to get him away from your home until you can get away.", "Nope. Show this to your roommates, hopefully this will convince them.\n\nNTA, I'm positive that whatever the other side of the story, it's not good enough to act that way. I'm sure everyone responding to this is going to agree.", "He\u2019s acting abusively.  Anyone who thinks he\u2019s acting otherwise is deluded.  NTA.", "NTA - And you should file harassment charges - ESPECIALLY - for picking the bathroom lock.", "NTA, couldn't be further from it. As others have said, just breaking in while you were showering alone was cause enough for kicking them out, if not further actions.", "NTA\nIf I were you I\u2019d file a report for sexual harassment with the boobs comment, as a girl in school where there\u2019s a guy that I know is obsessed with me and would stare at my body, I would\u2019ve told the authorities if that happened to me", "NTA\nHe's dangerous, breaking into the bathroom while you are naked should have been the last straw.", ">he was in my room while I was gone.\n\nFuck that.  Call the cops on his trespassing ass.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but please check your room for cameras.", "Keep your doors locked and I would start documenting everything. Keep a secret camera in your room too because if anything, once you move out, you can report it to the police. Do you have any family you can stay with? How long will it be until your friend is back? NTA", "NTA\n\nYou either need new roommates or they need new friends.", "I would say he crossed the red line on #2. NTA", "Nope.  Boot your roomie out as well.", "NTA. This dude is acting creepy and violating your boundaries. You were smart to kick him out and never let him back in. Keep standing up for yourself.", "These incidents, even on their own, are major red flags. You're not the asshole, this guy is definitely unsafe to be around. Doesn't matter what your roommates say or think about it, though I'd hope they'd be on your side.", "NTA. He sounds like he's one step away from raping you. You need to kick him out before it gets to that point because breaking into the bathroom while you're in the shower? Breaking into your room while you weren't there? That's already sexual assault and a break-and-enter. What if one day you come home to find him hiding in your room and he locks the door and starts assaulting you? In fact, he could've easily raped you while you were in the shower.\n\nFile sexual assault charges against him if you have to. Move out and find new roommates if that doesn't work. Kick his balls in if he tries to touch you. Whatever you do, make sure he stays away from you.\n\nYou also have to do a sweep of your room to make sure he didn't hide any cameras to catch you naked. Do the same with the bathroom too.", "NTA. like everyone else is saying, he crossed a boundary. your room is your personal space. and picking the lock on the bathroom??? mega oof.", "NTA. This guy sounds creepy enough to be concerning. He\u2019s already gone too far if you ask me. Leaving the hat in your room may not have been a mistake, but rather an attempt to intimidate you.", "NTA. Id carry a taser if i was you, hes escalating.", "NTA. He sounds utterly repulsive.", "Tell him that if he comes back, you're going to have him arrested for trespassing and harassment.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If your roommates and friends take his side, even after you\u2019ve explained your side of the story to them, you are now strangers. You don\u2019t know them anymore and shouldn\u2019t associate with them. Find new friends and roommates. Move out if you can. If you can\u2019t, make sure to check your room thoroughly for any missing items or any suspicious items. He was in there for a reason, whether it was to take something or put something in there. Install your own hidden or visible camera in the room for your own safety. Then, if he enters your room, you can see what he\u2019s doing and probably charge him for trespassing.", "Oh no! I would have thrown him out when he broke into my shower. Told him if I see him again I'd call the cops. You have no idea what could have happened to you.", "lmaooo nta. this guy has gone so far beyond what is acceptable behaviour", "The lock picking thing is gonna give me nightmares wtf", "NTA  Dudes never think their friends can be sexual predators.  Move now - all the friends inside the house has given him the pass to do this whenever he wants.   GET OUT FAST!", "NTA - you were more patient than most people, since most would've kicked him out and tell him to stay away after the bathroom incident. \n\nThose roommates are terrible friends / roommates if they are siding with him. They are pretty much encouraging this behaviour and tell him that it's ok to do this if they are siding with him. He is harassing you.\n\nSince they're all guys and think its all jokes and brother and sister banter, ask them if he picked the bathroom lock when their sister (or if they had a sister) is showering, would they be cool with that? Would they still think it's a joke?", "You been a AH to yourself for putting up with this. As I read this I couldn't help, but go wtf did I just read. \n\nGet this guy out of your home. Idc if the roomies like it or not. If they continue to allow him go get a restraining order. Than if he comes in he can get escorted out with cops. \n\nThis is not ok and in no way should you have to deal with it. Please please get him away from you.", "What he's doing is starting to enter the realm of stalking and harassment... you might want to talk to the authorities about it.  They probably won't do anything at first, but at least they'll make a report, and if he doesn't stop, then they'll be more likely to take action in the future. \n\nThe guy is a tool, and a fool.  NTA to you.  He has no business being in your place again, and anyone who feels sorry for this stalker in the making needs their head examined.", "Actually call the cops on him, he broke into the shower while you were showering! NTA That should've been the last straw.", "Please, please, please check for cameras in your room!!", "Border?  Dude pole vaulted over the line a long time ago.", "No, he is sexually harassing you and gaslighting you.", "Have you checked your room for hidden cameras? Any of your undergarments missing?\n\nNTA.", "The shower incident ismore than enough reason for calling  the police op. NTA but start taking measures against this unhinged ah before something really happens. Also get a lock on your door", "Call the police on him.op. it's criminal behavior to pick the locks and go in the bathroom while you are there.", "And check for cameras.", "If you are drunk you piss on the sink, not pick a lock and creep on someone.", "Yeah... as a guy (which is not even something I should need to add on), this is obviously unhinged and unacceptable behavior. It's disturbing they don't see anything wrong with anything he's done, especially not after the bathroom thing. They should be able to see it, but they're not. That says something about them too. Do not assume they'll draw the line somewhere, because even if that line does exist, it will have been too late by the time they do.\n\nYou need to do something now, whether that's a restraining order or changing your locks, or both. And you need to move out as soon as you feasibly can.", "They see it. They are just trying to set you two up. If you can leave now, leave. If not, please get a rubber door stopper for your door when you are in the shower and bedroom. Your safety is the first priority. Fuck their feelings.", "I was actually thinking just from reading your post that the other roommates must be male to minimize this.  You need to get away from all of them.", "She's so cute that she does porn! Even though she does not and that is a very creepy \"compliment,\" you *could* have an OnlyFans and nobody other than your closest friends would feel like it is their business to joke about it.", "and look for any hidden cameras\u2026.", "That\u2019s exactly what i was going to say.", "And maybe throw it through the wash for good measure.", "One of the girls I use to work with had to put up with a guy like this, along with the teasing that dismissed his behavior.\n\nShe decided to call him Stalky McRapey.  First name Stalky.  Last name McRapey.\n\nHe laughed at first, but when people asked why she called him that, she mentioned the attention and shoulder bumps and arm grabs and boob references.\n\nSoon, every time he slipped up, someone else would call him Stalky.  It became that he was outed with the same gusto that these people used on her when she was first upset.", "Yes. People get the premise of poking the bear\u2026but if they don\u2019t know the bear had been poked 12 times before it mauled a guy, it\u2019s going to look like the bear overreacted. NTA", "Mmm\u2026.Yea, they are all guys, I knew my roommates for years now and rooming with them was a last minute decision because things fell out with the person I was supposed to be living with. The point of this was to avoid sharing a small dorm with someone else but that may have been the better option with how things are going now :/", "THIS.", "Yep. Go on ebay and Amazon and search for hidden camera, spy camera etc and see just how many innocent objects can have hidden cameras. Clocks, smoke alarms, coat hooks, light bulbs, usb chargers, Teddy bears the list is endless.", "My parents showed me how one was designed when I was < 10 years old. A simple thin flathead was all that's needed. House bath locks aren't meant to be extremely secure, just to prevent accidental walk-ins. They assume folks in your house aren't perverts. \n\n(NTA. Dude should have been banned many incidents ago, not sure why OP has been waiting)", "The bathroom incident when you press charges with the police makes him a sex offender. Do It before he eacalates", "OP, when you are actually able to get out, don't tell them when you're going or where. If you need to finish out rent or something, do what needs to be done legally but don't interact with these people in person if you can help it.\n\nThis creep is way beyond just a sex pest harasser. Please be wary of escalation. He's unhinged and a danger.\n\nTrust your gut."]}
