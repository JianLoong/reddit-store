I don\u2019t know why, neither will tell me.  My mom remarried 4 years ago and my step-dad has 3 kids (14F, 11M, 9M).  I alternate weeks between my parents, but I\u2019m closer with my dad.  I also don\u2019t like the steps that much, so when I\u2019m at mom\u2019s I mostly try to stay out of the way and do my own thing.  My mom has been trying to make everyone get along for years but it\u2019s not working that well.  My dad is pretty well off, but my mom and step-dad aren\u2019t so the kids get mad when I have nicer things that they want or get to do things they can\u2019t.  My mom has asked my dad to let them come along before and he refused, which I\u2019m fine with because I kind of just want to get away from them when I\u2019m not at mom\u2019s.  It\u2019s a big issue for all of them though so I leave most of my nice stuff at my dad\u2019s and don\u2019t talk much when I\u2019m at mom\u2019s because they always find something to fight about.\n\nThis year, my dad\u2019s side of the family isn\u2019t doing a big get together for Christmas so since this is my year with him he suggested we go on a trip to Europe.  He has business to do for one day, but we would vacation a week together after and spend Christmas with a friend of his in Sweden. I\u2019m stoked, but my mom and step-dad don\u2019t want me to go. I won\u2019t be close enough to stop by on Christmas and they\u2019re not going to be able to afford to do much for the kids so me going on an expensive trip when they\u2019re mostly getting clothes and stuff will upset them.  I told them to just not tell them then and I\u2019ll Zoom on Christmas, but my step-dad got angry and told me I\u2019m selfish.  My mom called my dad and fought about it, but I\u2019m still going to go.\n\nFor the last two weeks, my mom has been hardcore trying to find any reason that I can\u2019t go and bringing it up anytime we talk. She went through my room while I was at school and she says she was looking for a piece of jewelry, but I think she was looking for my passport and stuff (which is at dad\u2019s). She tried to guilt me about not seeing my grandparents. Just on and on and I got tired of it and told her that if she doesn\u2019t stop I\u2019m not coming over anymore and living with dad full time.\n\nMy step-dad hit the roof and yelled at me for threatening my mom and always letting my dad buy me off with expensive stuff.  My mom won\u2019t talk to me. My dad said he wants me to have a relationship with my mom and to go easy on her, but it\u2019s up to me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670437717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf97q0/aita_for_threatening_my_mom_to_not_come_over/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s okay for you to accept things from your dad. I am a single mom and I have never turned down anything that someone wants to give my daughter- especially if it\u2019s something I know I cannot afford to do for her.

They are probably jealous but that's on them", "NTA - Based on your account of the events, it doesn't sound like you've been doing anything unreasonable. Your dad isn't responsible for your step-siblings and suggesting that he should treat you differently because of them isn't fair to either of you.", "NTA. It is not YOUR job to make her new family happy. It is not your Dad's job to include her new step children in his plans with HIS daughter.", "NTA, it's wonderful that your dad has the means to give you a great opportunity like a trip to Europe. Your mom should love that you can bond even more with your father and have this experience. Instead your mother is a selfish miserable woman. Have fun on your trip to Sweden!", "NTA\n\nSweden is lovely although it will be *cold* this time of year. If you spend time in Stockholm it is very hilly so wear comfortable shoes.", "NTA.  Go stay with your dad and be sure to tell mom, \u201cwhen she decides to be reasonable and apologize maybe you will come visit her.\u201d", "Honestly i dont think we can judge this. Your parents likely have a custody arrangement and there are terms to it. I would just keep your head down with your mom.", "Hey. Kid of divorced parents here. I am sorry that your experiencing this around your Christmas plans. \n\nIt is not uncommon for parents in conflict to use gift buying during the holidays to creat problems for the other parents. My dad did it. I am not saying that is what yours is doing but I understand how it can be seen that way. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are wrong for wanting to go. I do think you can do some more mitigation. You can talk about a day before or after Christmas when you will have a second celebration with your step mom and grand parents. You can also make sure that you are being aware of how much and how often you are talking about the trip in front of your step siblings cause your mom is right they will likely feel bad though this is not your fault and should not change your plans. \n\nYou should not use coming over as a threat for your mom and that\u2019s what you did. If you need to make a decision to live someplace full time you should but that shouldn\u2019t be a punishment or reaction to a fight. This is a good opportunity to practice some desclstion and boundary setting. \u201cMom I have already made my decision\u201d is a good line. Too you can also go to your dads house for breaks or any extended time if your mom and step Dad don\u2019t drop it. But that is different then threatening to permanently move out to end an argument. Again if you need to make a decision to live with your dad full time go for it. But threatening that is not good. \n\nThis is really tough and I am sorry you are dealing with it. \n\nNta for going on the trip. \nSlight YTA for threatening to move out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
