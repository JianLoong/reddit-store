That is not okay.", "NTA", "NTA\nYour mom and stepdad are the problem, and it\u2019s up to them to make the situation better by changing.", "NTA.\n\nPlease put zero zero blame on yourself. You just want happiness, and time with your dad this holiday. But your mom and step dad are making it impossible. I am sorry you\u2019re going through this. \n\nYour mom & her husband & the step kids happiness is not your dad nor your issues to deal with. End of story. \n\nAgree with limiting what you share with mom and step dad moving forward. I hope you feel safe wherever you are. Talk to your dad if you don\u2019t feel safe / comfortable. It\u2019s so wrong on many levels how they\u2019re treating & guilting you.", "If I had to guess, seeing how your mom moved on and dad didn't, there's probably infidelity amidst \n\nAnyway NTA. There was a similar story but the dad was asking the child to stop flaunting their wealth and I still think it should be none of the ex's concern where their ex is spending their money, especially if it's on their child.", "NTA your mom and step dad don\u2019t get a vote on what your dad chooses to spend money on", "NTA, this doesn't sound like a healthy household IMO. Your relationship with your Dad is just that, your relationship. This atmosphere is toxic. It isn't your fault or your Dad's that the other kids get what they get.", "NTA and I think a break from your moms might be a good idea. Stepdad getting so angry with you concerns me. Go on that vacation with your dad!!!\n\nThis is also an opportunity for your mom and stepdad to teach your steps that someone will always have more than you. And I mean always. But they probably have more than a lot of other people.", "Fellow divorce kiddo here. NTA. I\u2019ve been in similar situations when my families still were acting a bit, uh, crazed. Your dad has the right attitude and your mom (and step dad) seem to be TA. It\u2019s your choice whether or not you go, and it\u2019s your right to get to make those fun memories. And it\u2019s not your fault that one family is better off than the other. You offered a solution (the zoom call) which wasn\u2019t selfish, selfish would be rubbing it in everyone\u2019s face and going no contact over the vacation. Getting to travel overseas with family is so special, and both parents should support it. Also that \u201cthreat\u201d that your step dad freaked out over was just you setting a boundary. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. \n\nIf you need a random internet friend to talk to about divorced kid things or if you need to talk through things, please know that I\u2019m here. I wish you the best of luck, and if you do go on the trip I hope it\u2019s fun and that you and your dad have a fantastic time!", "NTA\nOP- It may be a good idea to just live with your Dad full time, at least until after the holidays.  Your mother and stepfather aren't going to stop trying to sabotage your trip. You don't need to be in an enviornment that is so toxic.", "NTA you're under no obligation to curtail your life and pass on positive experiences so other people won't be jealous and no decent parent would ask their child to do so, they would want them to have the best life possible.\n\nAs long as you're not rubbing it in anyone's face, which you're not, then you should feel free to enjoy every opportunity available to you.\n\nIt's incredibly selfish of your mom and stepdad to expect you to do anything else. \n\nAlso, Your mom asking your dad to take her step kids places is fucking unhinged.", "You\u2019re definitely not alone. OP\u2019s parents won\u2019t say why they got divorced and OP\u2019s dad wants him to have a relationship withe the mom? She cheated with the stepdad and the dad is too good of a person to tell OP what happened", "wrong place", "I love when people bring up the past! In the past, society had less divorce, less blended families, less baby mamas and baby daddy\u2019s. No kid wants to share their parents with someone that\u2019s not their sibling. \n\nIn the past, most mothers wouldn\u2019t giddily love to deprive their child of wonderful experiences to please a guy she\u2019s been married to for 4 years and his kids. Terrible mom right there.", "She\u2019s a minor. Her mother still has some form of custody even if it\u2019s split. Likely the mom needs to be informed of an international trip. \nYeah the mom is being an AH right now, doesn\u2019t mean that the dad can just take her to Europe without notice.", "Wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s dad\u2019s custody time.", "It's easier to kowtow to an abuser, that doesn't make the abuser a good person.", "This is super weird. I traveled ALONE to Europe when I was 16 and I didn\u2019t have any legal documents from my parents\u2014just my passport.", "If it's a trip of less than 90 days a visa isn't normally necessary so they'd just have normal border checks.", "Who do you present the permission slip to? How would the customs agents know that OP's parents are divorced? How would they know who to ask?", "It\u2019s not up to the states alone. It\u2019s up to the states, the custodial order and the country they are visiting. \n\n\u201cThere are very few instances in which a parent can legally leave the country with his or her child without the consent of the child\u2019s other parent, even when the traveling parent is the custodial parent. These restrictions were created to reduce of out-of-country parental kidnapping.\u201d", "NAL but worked for years in a family/divorce firm. It *is* jurisdiction-dependent but parents in many cases cannot unilaterally take children out of the country without leave of the court. You are mistaken; it being dads time is immaterial. And I want to be very clear about this, as it\u2019s not a men\u2019s/dads\u2019 rights issue: it is absolutely to protect the child and the parental rights of the other parent.", "In the US, even during dad\u2019s custody time, he still needs mom\u2019s permission to take her  out of country. \n\nThis is to prevent parental kidnappings.", "This is very true. I\u2019m lucky that my custody order is itemized so no misunderstandings can happen. I legally don\u2019t need my ex\u2019s permission to get my son a passport, drivers, to travel anywhere in the world and I can move without notifying him to. He gets no say what\u2019s so ever. I\u2019m in Canada though and my order is very solid.", "My Dad took us out of the country(no passport required at that time) when he explicitly could not(court order) but since she didn't know about it until afterwards, she didn't do anything about it.", "Oof, your dad must be a fucking Saint."]}
