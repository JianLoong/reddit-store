Some examples include: \n\n1. Him getting into relationships with 3 other women while he was emotionally unavailable to my sister.\n2. Him marrying one of those women (they claim it was only a sham marriage) while keeping my sister on the back burner. \n3. All together the 9 years of them dating he would call my sister stupid, fat, dirty (to her face) and ugly. She saw a group chat where he told his family how unattractive she is and he would tell her to her face how he was attracted to his female friends.\n4. Him controlling her finances, e.g. she has not gone to a hair salon in the past 3 years. But he has many cars, and expensive hobbies.\n5. Him not believing in marriage or gifts for the first 8 years of their situation-ship and the last 2 of their relationship. So, for the last 9 years I was her Valentines, birthday and anniversary gift giver. She would be heartbroken 3x a year. He only started doing these things for her this year. \n\nThe fight: My sister got a new job that increased her salary by 40%. She is declining it and going back to her old job because of her husband. I got mad at her for wasting my time with mock interviews and salary negotiation strategies and honestly mad at her for yet another sacrifice she was making for the sake of him. Years of holding my tongue came out and she accused me of being jealous that she has someone who wants to marry her and I don\u2019t. She and her husband love to bring up that I am single and accuse me of being jealous of their relationship every time I stick up for her.\n\nWe\u2019ve gone no contact since then and I didn\u2019t even hear from her when I had a big life event (I passed my certification exam for work), even though I came through for her every time he broke her heart and even officiated the local wedding for a relationship I didn\u2019t really support.\n\nTLDR: Being stuck overseas for 5 days without a plus 1, spending at least 3k for a wedding all for the sake of maintaining a one sided relationship with my sister feels like I will be resentful about this in the future.

Thank you for the accolades, and for acknowledging my big day\u2014solidcordon!!\n\nMy career is everything to me, I studied for months for this exam and she knew how much this meant for me and my career going forward. Not a single wish of luck sent before or after. Unlike me that showed up, got ordained and officiated her big day. Thank you also for your advice on family not choosing to be there. I appreciate your comment so much.", "Hey there, thanks for the really supportive comment. The second ceremony is because my sister did not want to wait until then to make it legal between the two of them, she had waited by his side the 5 years he was married to the immigrant girl he brought over (he finally divorced after the ex wife got her green card) and 9 years total. So, that\u2019s why they are doing two: one small local one at the courthouse that I officiated, and one overseas later this year (her dream wedding). \n\nI did not think about the reciprocal aspect of our relationship. She never once supported me in my of my past relationships and even guilted me when my exes would do really nice things for me. She even would call me everyday telling me to break up with them until I finally would. But seems really happy with me in the last few years I\u2019ve been single. And if I were to get married overseas, she would have to check with her husband to get permission to spend money. So she would likely not go to mine TBH. \n\nThank you for your comment and advocacy.", "\u201cYou appear to be single at least in part thanks to her behavior.\u201d \n\nHOW DID YOU KNOW??? I once had a boyfriend 3 years ago that really loved me and she would guilt me whenever our relationship would make her feel bad in hers. \n\nE.g. When I met his family or when he got me my first ever Valentine\u2019s (I never had a bf before, even though I was 33 years old at the time): she would cry for hours telling me she will never have that and that I needed to break up with him for reasons that she felt were dealbreakers (e.g. him spending time playing games on his computer). I listened to her advice and broke up with him. I have been single since and working on myself, plus she finds something wrong in every guy I\u2019ve tried to date. \n\nNow that her guy has finally \u201cchanged\u201d, she forgot she manipulated me and tells me I need to grow up and be accountable for what I did to my ex. I feel gaslighted because she says she never forced me to do anything and that it was all me. She overall is much happier and benefits more when I\u2019m single. You hit the nail on the head, my friend.", "Hey! Thanks for asking: There was a character limit on my first post so I had to take the details out. \n\nHe legally married immigrant girl he brought over in 2018, \u201cofficially\u201d got into a relationship my sister in 2020, divorced immigrant girl earlier this year in 2023 (after 5 years, even though the legal requirement for her green card is only 2 years), proposed to my sister 2 months ago and they got married 2 weeks ago. \n\nMy sister did not want to wait another year for her dream wedding overseas to make it legal between the two of them, so that\u2019s why they are doing two: one locally at the courthouse and one overseas later this year.", "Thank you for saying this. I have been picking up the pieces for 9 years now, even forgoing my own relationships to make her feel more secure in hers.", "Frankly, don\u2019t go to the wedding. At this point, your sister is using you as her emotional crutch. I would tell her that while you don\u2019t approve of this relationship, you will always love her but until she decides to leave for good you can no longer support her. If she needs help to leave, you\u2019ll be there but until then, you\u2019re done with it.\n\nStop putting your life and relationships on hold for her. That isn\u2019t healthy.

And the fact that she makes fun if you for being single when she's in a HORRIBLE relationship with a \"man\" is hilarious, next time she does that tell her you rather be alone forever than with someone like him. NTA!!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA.  Keep the no contact status.", "I'm sorry your sister has let you down and hurt your heart. You are an amazing person and you should be incredibly proud of yourself for your accomplishments and for all the love and support you have given. No, you WNBTA, not even a little. You have showed up and shelled out enough of your time emotions and money. Instead you should take the money you would have spent on travel and do something to celebrate YOU, because i have a feeling you have spent a lot of time building up others and not enough celebrating yourself. Sending you hugs and love and wishing you all the happiness the world has to offer!"]}
