MIL will likely turn into a raging dragon and terrorize the poor child if she so much as yawns or shuffles her feet wrong.  My mind is blown by the fact that she actually had the brass balls to call your parents and demand they alter their vacation plans to come babysit! Given her disgustingly overbearing and obnoxious behavior so far, you would be much better off to simply let SIL know that none of you will be there as anything other than guests because you're not going to put your kids, your folks and yourselves through any more stress and hassle.  SIL can take this one on the chin--she threw you under the bus here and hasn't had the gumption to tell Mommy Dearest to STFU and STFD.  You did it, so it can be done.  Spare your whole family this nightmare.", "This sounds adorable", "Mother-in-law sounds unreasonable, it\u2019s too bad you couldn\u2019t figure out a workable plan to have your kids involved in the capacity you were comfortable with and allowing your husband and yourself some time to enjoy yourselves sans kids for one evening.", "I\u2019m lost on that one as well.", "Won\u2019t let you back out? LMAO how does she think she\u2019ll stop you? \n\nI get that she\u2019s funding it (or I guess her husband is but joint money) and I even get why SIL might not go against the bank in this fight, but what in the hell does MIL think she can do to force you to participate? Kidnap you?", "You know how you back out? You tell SIL and MIL that you won't be there, and then you don't show up. What are they going to do, hire kidnappers to make sure you get to the ceremony?", "She can't *make* you come. You can all tell her you'd rather not come if she's going to be so rigid. You're doing them a favor. Not the other way around. No one WANTS to be in a wedding. Well, some people probably do but... Those people are weird.

Attending without the kids would have been our preference to begin with but we would have made other plans for the kids if one or none was invited.

Your husband needs to tell his mom she is in danger of never seeing him or your kids again.", "Everyone but my son is invited. It is expected I leave him for the weekend or my parents come to watch him. But he\u2019s no longer invited otherwise. All free babysitting already have plans since it\u2019s summer/start of school here and a full weekend caring for a toddler is a lot to ask.", "This is my mom, and why my wedding was a shit show, because my mother-in-law went around me to my mom at every turn. \n\nIf she had invited my parents to the wedding in the first place, they are the first people my kids would go to if they needed someone and I was not available. They made it clear my parents were not invited and my parents made plans that week. That is whyI will not allow them to use my parents now. \n\nI shut that down when it was suggested, I shut it down when she called my parents, and I shut it down when I booked the Nanny. That will not happen. \n\nThey have made it clear that my parents will be invited as unpaid help and so that my mother-in-law can show off the type of wedding she can throw which is different from my wedding, but not because I couldn\u2019t have it, because I didn\u2019t want it.", "Oh that makes it all make sense - this is just some petty payback on MILs part for the perceived slight of you not allowing her to plan your (her) dream wedding, NTA", "Lol sounds great and you are lucky, but any bride using an 18 month old had better have a rock solid contingency plan!", "NTA - Why set 5 year old up for failure?

Tell him he needs to call his sister and speak with her because their mom has changed the plan that you all had in place an uninvited your child who was ring bearer. Tell him if she doesn't get back to him by x time you will all pull out of the wedding. Then do what you can to get a refund. She doesn't get to just ignore you and hope the problem resolves itself. Either She stands up to MIL or yall back out as a family for them changing the plans 6 weeks from the wedding.", "No they can't make you come but backing out will create an awkward family dynamic that will take years to smooth over and we reddit trolls loooooove to suggest to you AITA folks that pushing friends and family away is always the answer. \ud83d\ude44 clearly that's not the solution.\n   \nSIL seems remarkably calm considering most brides who show up on this sub have premarital psychosis. She's doing what she can to keep the peace with her mom and she has decided that the ring bearer is not a battle worth fighting. That's fair because it seems like if MIL is going to start making last minute adjustments to a day she's probably planned down to the last tulle pleat, and one of those changes is as big as the ring bearer and guest list, she's probably pushing SIL on a lot of things.\n   \nI do have a question though OP. Who has MIL replaced your son with? Another grandbaby? Her toy poodle? Did she say why your son shouldn't have this job? Did she explain why he's not allowed at all even if he's not the one toddling with the pillow? Has she banned all children under the age of 5 or is it just him? Why is your young daughter still allowed? What am I missing? Why is gramma treating her grandson differently than her granddaughter?", "Don\u2019t go. This is way too much stress.

The next youngest even considered to be invited is a cousin at 15 years old. She\u2019s worried baby boy will take away from the ceremony or at least that is that she is saying.\n\nNo idea why the 5 year old doesn\u2019t take away other than she\u2019s a hit older and a hi dressed like a princess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Ugh all this is too exhausting for me to read.  Good luck!!!", "Omgosh I so know it was!! And I can\u2019t even ask for pet tax because of the toddler lol sounds amazingly sweet though!!", "Why though?
