Getting hospitalised for mental health issues can be an awful experience, but it's usually needed once things get to that stage. You were just trying to help. Dealing with a mentally unwell person who refuses to seek help, or even see how unwell they are, is very hard. It's a tough situation to be in, and I'm sure even more so with a young baby. While I can understand her feeling betrayed, since you went behind her back and read her journal without her permission, it sounds like she needed help, but was/is in denial. PPD can be very serious and scary. \nI have had to have my partner committed (before we had our baby) and it's extremely difficult. I felt guilty. But he was better for it in the end. He's still alive.\nI hope she starts to accept help and things improve for you all.", "NTA. Postpartum depression is very serious, and if you\u2019re seeing disturbing behavior or her writing about disturbing things, there\u2019s also the possibility of postpartum psychosis.

I don't care if I get down voted, PPD is a real and very dangerous thing. She might resent you for it now, but you may have just saved her life. Sometimes, as spouses, we have to make hard decisions in order to take care of our husbands/wives. You didn't know they were going to do a 72 hour hold, but what's more, the doctor wouldn't have ordered it if he(she?) wasn't also concerned for your wife's safety. I know my obgyn had a serious talk with my husband after I had my baby, and he also checked in with him regarding my mental health every time he accompanied me on one of my post partum appointments. You did what you needed to do to help your wife, and the Dr did what they needed to do. Now it's up to your wife to take the medicine and do the therapy.

You didn't betray her or fail as a husband.\n\nSadly, there is no guarantee that she will see that.

Which isn't fair, but is a thing which can happen.\n\nThat said - if she does refuse treatment and continue to be sick and resent you, well, that would have happened anyway.\n\nYou have done the thing which has the greatest chance of saving her life and your marriage.

NTA! In fact, you may be a hero! She may be upset now but she is not herself. You may have saved your child\u2019s life and she will surely thank you later. The heartbreak and grief the poor father of those dead babies has to deal with every minute for the rest of his life is a cross no human should ever have to bear. Not to mention how the mother will be villified and the absolute torture and agony she will live with for killing her own children that she very clearly and without a doubt loved and cared for perfectly before her bout with what basically was insanity..never could they have imagined when they were planning during that last pregnancy the horror they would be dealing with months later..do not feel guilty for a single second..do you understand?

So what if she was having a good day\u2014you err on the side of caution.  Those poor kids.", "No Lindsey Clancy. That other lady was just insane because she killed her kids so her husband couldn't have them", "Fair enough! She can't help being sick", "This is the exception, not the rule. Yes, it should be taken seriously, but no, a woman should not be considered an inherent danger because she has postpartum depression.", "But acting like she's inherently a danger isn't helpful either.", "I am aware and please see my above responses and edit, if you haven't.", "Women are equally as likely to murder children as men, but in the case of women it's often due to post-partum psychosis or PPD. That doesn't mean that OP's wife us necessarily dangerous to herself or her child but it's a real risk and shouldn't be taken lightly.", "Bringing what aboutisms into this is absolutely not necessary.", "Until she is in therapy and the therapist thinks it's ok I would say.", "If she's considered an inherent danger to the point she's involuntarily committed and already displaying negative emotions toward her child (becoming increasingly irritated and resenting him for breastfeeding), she poses a threat to that baby.", "My grandma, though they didn't have a name for it back then, had PPD. They didn't have a treatment for it either. As she's told me, a lot of women got depressed after having a baby in those years. You either survived it and got past it, or you didn't. She survived it, and so did her kids. Obviously not everyone can do that without treatment, most can't, and it's excellent that there are treatments and a greater awareness now. But unfortunately there's also this stigma about it because you only ever hear about the extremes where mothers kill their kids. Not the ones who get meds and go to therapy and get better. Or the ones who struggled through it because they had no choice but to do that when they were new mothers and whose kids grew up and made it to adulthood. There needs to be more awareness of PPD and it needs to not focus solely on the extreme cases, but rather also the ones where people got the help they needed and were okay.\n\nETA: I'm agreeing with you and just adding onto your point", "A woman from around where I grew up suffered postpartum depression, she put two of her babies in the freezer, it happened six years apart. \nShe removed one of the babies from the freezer after three years and put it in a box in the woods, and thats how they found the other baby that was still in the freezer and had been there for nine years. A friend of my brothers was one of them who found the box with the frozen baby, he's still fucked up and its been over 20 years.\nSo yeah, it's an exception but people still need to be aware it.", "Actually, not necessarily. It depends what she wrote in that journal. She may strictly be a danger to herself.", "I appreciate your insightful response. I suspect that a lot of responses and upvotes/downvotes are due to what is popular in the media lately and not due to any real personal experience or education.", "A friend told me postpartum, \u201cit\u2019s okay to cry every day as long as you don\u2019t cry all day!\u201d It took me too long to realize, wait no, that\u2019s not okay either, friend are you okay???", "I'm glad you eventually realized!"]}
