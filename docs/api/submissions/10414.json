Getting hospitalised for mental health issues can be an awful experience, but it's usually needed once things get to that stage. You were just trying to help. Dealing with a mentally unwell person who refuses to seek help, or even see how unwell they are, is very hard. It's a tough situation to be in, and I'm sure even more so with a young baby. While I can understand her feeling betrayed, since you went behind her back and read her journal without her permission, it sounds like she needed help, but was/is in denial. PPD can be very serious and scary. \nI have had to have my partner committed (before we had our baby) and it's extremely difficult. I felt guilty. But he was better for it in the end. He's still alive.\nI hope she starts to accept help and things improve for you all.", "NTA. Postpartum depression is very serious, and if you\u2019re seeing disturbing behavior or her writing about disturbing things, there\u2019s also the possibility of postpartum psychosis. Neither of these are things that should be ignored, and as hard as it is to feel like you\u2019ve betrayed her trust, this is months of changed behavior. It\u2019s not like she acted    off for a few weeks, 9 months is a long time to see someone you love behave totally differently.", "NAH. I don't care if I get down voted, PPD is a real and very dangerous thing. She might resent you for it now, but you may have just saved her life. Sometimes, as spouses, we have to make hard decisions in order to take care of our husbands/wives. You didn't know they were going to do a 72 hour hold, but what's more, the doctor wouldn't have ordered it if he(she?) wasn't also concerned for your wife's safety. I know my obgyn had a serious talk with my husband after I had my baby, and he also checked in with him regarding my mental health every time he accompanied me on one of my post partum appointments. You did what you needed to do to help your wife, and the Dr did what they needed to do. Now it's up to your wife to take the medicine and do the therapy.

You didn't betray her or fail as a husband.\n\nSadly, there is no guarantee that she will see that.  If she does get treatment and help, she will be grateful for your actions when she gets through; if she doesn't, she's going to continue to resent you.  Which isn't fair, but is a thing which can happen.\n\nThat said - if she does refuse treatment and continue to be sick and resent you, well, that would have happened anyway.\n\nYou have done the thing which has the greatest chance of saving her life and your marriage.  I hope it works.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife needed mental health care long before now. PPD is very real. Involuntary confinement is what happens when there is evidence that someone might hurt themselves. Sorry that you are learning all of this the hard way, but that is how most folks learn to deal with mental health issues. Be prepared to step it up. You are mom, dad and caregiver until your wife is once again back to her old self.", "Speaking as someone with a mentally ill family member, you are NTA.\n\nBe strong, man.   Whatever happens you have a son to look out for.   Hopefully your wife comes around to understand why you had her placed on an MIW, but the alternative is unacceptable.

I had serious post partum issues and I wish I had been forced to get help for it. It was horrible and terrifying and I didn't realize just how bad it was until I finally got diagnosed with mental health issues when my kids were teenagers.

She will realize that you were doing her a favor someday.", "NTA. Postpartum depression is serious. She needed help. You did the caring, loving thing, hard as it was.", "Look up the mother In Massachusetts who had severe PPD and killed her 3 children, including an infant. She was a nurse and was being treated and still was in such a severe psychotic state from her PPD that even with her husband choosing to work from home to help her through and everyone doing what they could for her, she killed them the minute her husband left to pick up take out. NTA! In fact, you may be a hero! She may be upset now but she is not herself. You may have saved your child\u2019s life and she will surely thank you later. The heartbreak and grief the poor father of those dead babies has to deal with every minute for the rest of his life is a cross no human should ever have to bear. Not to mention how the mother will be villified and the absolute torture and agony she will live with for killing her own children that she very clearly and without a doubt loved and cared for perfectly before her bout with what basically was insanity..never could they have imagined when they were planning during that last pregnancy the horror they would be dealing with months later..do not feel guilty for a single second..do you understand?

You wanted help, not for to be held in hospital.\n\nI'd suggest marriage counselling from here on.\n\nNTA?", "NTA she needs this. She needs to get better. You are a good partner for putting your own feelings aside to get her help, eeven if she isnt ready to see it", "NTA.

I do understand her being upset, because I think anyone would be, but hopefully in time once she gets medically regulated and is doing better she\u2019ll be more understanding of why you did what you did.

You did the right thing!", "NTA. \n\nDo not beat yourself up for this you were protecting your wife from herself.
