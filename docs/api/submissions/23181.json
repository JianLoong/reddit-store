He is non-aggressive reactive toward other dogs his size or bigger, so I do what I can (full body harness, tight leash, treats, etc.) There\u2019s this small children\u2019s park that doubles as a dog park, but the rule is that you\u2019re supposed to keep your dog leashes 6 feet or shorter.

I know not ALL Rottweilers are aggressive, but I don\u2019t trust one that I don\u2019t know. To stop my dog from reacting, I pulled him away across the park but the dog didn\u2019t get the hint so I clapped and barked to get it away. I spotted who I thought was it\u2019s owner sitting on a bench across the park, and gestured toward the dog. They whistled for the dog, and it got about halfway toward its owner before coming back toward me. \n\nThe same routine occurred (pulling my dog away and the bark/clap combo) before yelling toward the person to leash their dog as my dog was getting upset. They yelled back \u201cdon\u2019t worry, she\u2019s friendly!\u201d And when the dog still didn\u2019t get the hint, I put my dog behind me and pulled out my taser that I carry for protection on walks. I turned it on a few times (at no point did I TASE the dog or even approach it with the taser). The dog got understandably spooked by the noise and ran back fully to its owner, at which point they finally got off of their ass and ran over to me. They started losing it on me, calling me a bitch for threatening their dog with electrocution. I yelled back that they have to keep their dog leashed for this very reason and they scoffed at me, saying that I didn\u2019t OWN the public park. I\u2019m still miffed about it, but I feel bad for scaring their dog like that.

Dog tries to bolt, issues for dog (not pain, it\u2019s just their neck muscles are not as strong as leg / torso. When they pull on a muzzle collar it forces their head to turn. )", "NTA. I hate the \"my dog's friendly\" crowd. My dog is friendly too, but I keep her on a lead and don't let her go up to other dogs without the other owner saying first that it's ok to do so. I was chatting to another owner recently of a small dog who is reactive to big dogs. A retriever came running over, it's owner way behind smiling while we tried to call to the owner to call her dog back. She didn't of course \"he's friendly!!\" My dog sniffed and greeted the retriever and then the retriever tried to greet the reactive little dog, the little dog started to growl and snap, with the owner holding him back so he couldn't reach the retriever. Meanwhile the retriever's owner is still way behind and not in a hurry. The retriever got angry at the little dog's reaction and tried to snap at it, so we were yelling at the owner to hurry and get her dog, I was trying to hold the retriever's collar, and the small dog owner trying to hold her dog back. When she finally came to get her dog, there was not a single word of an apology.\nYour dog may be friendly, but if it encounters a scared and reactive dog, it may react.", "NTA.

I carry a club and will hit a dog that comes up to us and I don't care what the shitty ass owners think.", "The only way to stop a dog fight is to take the dog's air away. How will you do that with one of those dumb, painful straps over the dog's face?", "Choking a dog is inherently cruel and violent. The straps are not painful in the slightest. You\u2019re just using the dogs strength against him. They learn fast. \n\nSo, a muzzle leash is painful but jerking a dog back on his choke chain is somehow a gentle means of control?"]}
