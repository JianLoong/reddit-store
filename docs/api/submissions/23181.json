I hate the \"my dog's friendly\" crowd. My dog is friendly too, but I keep her on a lead and don't let her go up to other dogs without the other owner saying first that it's ok to do so.

A retriever came running over, it's owner way behind smiling while we tried to call to the owner to call her dog back. She didn't of course \"he's friendly!!\" My dog sniffed and greeted the retriever and then the retriever tried to greet the reactive little dog, the little dog started to growl and snap, with the owner holding him back so he couldn't reach the retriever. Meanwhile the retriever's owner is still way behind and not in a hurry. The retriever got angry at the little dog's reaction and tried to snap at it, so we were yelling at the owner to hurry and get her dog, I was trying to hold the retriever's collar, and the small dog owner trying to hold her dog back.

Lots of people have been mauled by \u201cfriendly\u201d dogs.", "I had a similar thing happen to me\u2026 We knew she was non aggressive reactive and had been working with trainers to help her. Slowly, but surely, she was getting better and was able to tolerate most dogs up to a distance of about 6ft away (reasonable distance to fair!).\nShe used to react out of fear, and it was mostly barking, snarling and a desperate attempt to get away. She would drag backwards on her lead trying to yank me in the other direction, tail between her legs, whining and growling if another dog came to close to her, but we were getting there and had finally made it to a stage where she was comfortable walking past other dogs on the other side of the road without making a sound or pulling at all.\n\nOne day, we were walking her around a massive field. We always keep her leashed just as precaution. About ten mins into our walk, an unleashed dog came bounding over to us. It was so fast that I didn\u2019t have a chance to shout or locate the owner. The other dog ran up to mine and jumped on her - didn\u2019t appear aggressive but it was way too close and way too fast for mine to stay calm. She panicked, and instantly started trying to escape. She was howling, whining, pulling me backwards, all whilst this other dog was tripping me up in a desperate attempt to get to mine. I tried so hard to keep myself in between them, still with the other owner out of sight. Mine eventually started barking, growling and baring her teeth. She was wayyyyyy past her limit and I honestly didn\u2019t know what to do.\nI was on the verge of physically removing the other dog from mine when suddenly the owner came over and shouted \u2018don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s friendly. He just likes to run up and say hi\u2019. I was absolutely fuming I shouted back that mine is petrified, and he needs to get his dog under control and not be so far away from it that it appears abandoned! They finally called their dog off, and they disappeared from sight again.\n\nMine calmed down, we went to walk away, and suddenly the other dog was on top of her again! Mine lost her shit, snapped the other dog and left puncture wounds. Honestly, as bad as it sounds, I don\u2019t blame her. I probably would have reacted with violence if someone had done that to me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Owner then tried accusing us of being in the wrong, saying mine was violent, aggressive and needed to be put down. Never mind the fact he\u2019d admitted his runs up to other dogs and clearly didn\u2019t have it under control at all, nor did he leash his after being told mine was reactive?! \n\nNow, mine reacts in fear and goes to attack immediately! No more trying to escape, just straight to full blown attack mode the second she even sees another dog, let alone one coming close to her. We\u2019ve had to spend thousands in trainers and behaviourists to try and get her to calm down again, but nothing is working. We cannot have her around any other dogs at all anymore, even the ones she was originally training with who she\u2019d built trust with. She has to be muzzled at all times when out just in case another dog approaches her like that again, and we\u2019re suffering with other owners glaring at us and calling us terrible owners because she starts reacting as soon as she sees another dog now, and honestly, she looks scary as hell when she reacts now. We\u2019ve even had comments telling us to put her down because of it, and she\u2019s not even a year old!!! \n\nIf id have had a taser on me, you bet your arse id have flashed it! And if the dog continued, id have used it too! Perhaps if id had a taser on me, my dog wouldn\u2019t be suffering so much now! This shot really fucks me off because my baby, who was doing so bloody well with training, is now mentally ruined when it comes to other dogs. We\u2019ve been told there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll never recover from this and will always be fear based, aggressive reactive to other dogs. \n\nWeirdly, she loves sheep though \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdit for verdict: NTA!!

My friend's dog is a rescue and was used as a bait dog in dog fighting rings. Because of that he's terrified of other dogs. A dog running towards him off leash would cause a very dangerous situation. That's an extreme example but a lot of dogs go into fight mode when they are on leash and an off leash dog approaches them. So it doesn't matter how friendly the off leash dog is if other dogs around them aren't friendly. I don't understand why some people think they have a right to have their dogs off leash when it's against the law.
