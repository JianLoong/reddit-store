My mom and dad both lost their first spouses. Mom's first husband had died 4 years before she met my dad and my dad's first wife died two years before he met my mom. I had siblings from both parents first marriages. My dad had two kids who were 10 and 11 years old and my mom had three kids who were 12, 10 and 9. I was born soon after they married and growing up I was not close to my mom's kids at all. They did not like that mom remarried and had another baby (I almost feel like they thought that was an even bigger betrayal of their dad). They did not have any kind of closeness or friendship with my dad's kids. They wanted nothing to do with dad at all, or me. With my dad's kids it was different. They loved me and even though they were honest and told me they wished their mom was alive still and would rather have that old family with her alive, they were happy to have me around anyway. Even with the age gap I always felt like I was included by them and I knew they loved me.\n\nI'm 19 now and I am still so much closer to my siblings from dad. I really don't have anything to do with my mom's kids. I see them at best once a year. Their kids do not know me and I don't really know my mom's kids either.\n\nIt breaks my mom's heart when she sees how close I am to my other siblings and I know that. I remember her encouraging her kids to spend some time with me over the years and I remember her talking to them about me but it never did help much. My siblings (dad's kids) invite me places, I interact with the kids they have and their spouses and sometimes we hang out as friends too.\n\nSome friends and I were throwing a party a couple of weeks ago and my siblings and their spouses came. When mom found out about it she asked about her kids and I told her they hadn't been invited. She asked if I had given up on them and I told her I had accepted that they didn't want a relationship with me. She said she thought I might still want to try and how could I accept them not wanting anything to do with me. I told her she should accept it too. She told me she wanted me to invite them in future. I told her it won't happen and she needs to accept she can't control who I invite. She was upset with me.

Just because I don\u2019t think a single person in this situation is wrong for feeling the way they do. It sounds like your mom wasn\u2019t overbearing in her attempts to liaise peace amongst all of her children. Therapy would\u2019ve been good for everyone, sure. But it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s any animosity between you and your mothers children. It just seems like everyone has a mutual understanding of the relationship at this point, except your mother. But she isn\u2019t wrong for her hopes, it\u2019s human. Logically thinking (aka apathetic reddit logic), yes her hopes are unrealistic. She should definitely come to terms with the idea that her first 3 children have done nothing to make you feel invited or welcome. But it doesn\u2019t make her an asshole to want her children to at least be friendly with each other.\n\nETA: since the question is about you inviting the maternal siblings or not, no I don\u2019t think the siblings have done anything to deserve an invitation.

If anything they should at least reach out with a olive branch if they want to be invited to your party.\n\nThe thing is, it\u2019s going to be awkward as heck, if they show up to your party when they and you both don\u2019t want them there.\n\nAt least it\u2019s not a full on hate fest. Everyone is just living their own life and doing their own thing.\n\nTell your mom not to overthink it.

Again, i\u2019ll say therapy probably would\u2019ve been great for everyone, but whats done is done. Going forward, I think just ignore them and do your best to reassure your mom that this really best for everyone! Good luck going forward!", "I hope you have a clear conscience that what happened to your siblings parents is not your fault at all and therefore is not your fault that your siblings from mom's side feel that way towards you.

I can't remember exactly. But yeah, what's done is done and nothing can change the way things are now. Thank you.", "I don't know that they will regret it, honestly. After 19 years and with them being parents themselves and married, I just don't know that much will change. But at the end of the day I can't make them care about me. I can't make them not hate me. I have learned to accept that.", "As children, I can see their attitude. They were pissed at your mom for \"betraying\" their dad. But they love her, so they took it out on you and your dad. Stupid, but also childish. The truly sad part is that as they got older, they didn't acquire a more adult view of the situation and realize they were being absolute assholes. Do they really believe your mother should not have had a chance at happiness again? That she should have continued to sleep alone and come home to an empty house when they left the nest? If they do, they're even worse than assholes. Can they truly say they would never remarry or have more children if they were widowed? They might say it. They might even believe it, but I doubt that's what would happen if the worst happened to them. Good luck to you, and I hope your mother accepts that she can't force you to keep reaching out only to be rejected again and again.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your mom has been reflecting and really wishing that all of her children had a closer relationship.\n\nInstead of her pushing you to be the bigger person and invite them, she should be speaking with her other children, as it was their decisions that did not allow for a good relationship to foster.\n\nYour siblings are the ones that need to make an effort and try and build a relationship if that's what everyone wants, but she should not force it.", "NTA it\u2019s unreasonable that your mom expects you to still try with people who have shown for nearly two decades that they have no interest in you or their step siblings.", "Exactly this.

She can't control them or what they do, and they have clearly made their choice. \n\nNTA it's very mature of you to understand that they are adults and clearly do not want to make or maintain a connection. A relationship goes 2 ways and even if you wanted one with them, they don't so it won't happen.\n\nI understand why your mom is upset because it would be ideal if everyone got along, but that's not how real life works.
