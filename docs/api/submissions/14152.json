She's the worst, no one in my family likes her, she hates my mom and grandma, and only likes my dad because he has some money and she tries to use him for it. People like that don't change.\n\nIf your brother is anything like mine, his mind has been poisoned with what she says, and it won't get better until/if they split. I guarantee she said she didn't want you there and your brother complied. That should show you the hill he is willing to die on.\n\nAlso, you're way better of a person than I am.
