The chain is fairly small and sturdy, and made of a stainless steel core with alternating gold and silver links over top, so it's stronger. The clasp for the chain is invisible, and the ring can be clipped on and off of the ring without having to take the chain off. I made it so that she could turn it and hide the clip so she could wear the chain separately from the ring as well. \n\nI thought it was really cool, and I proposed on Sunday at the park after mothers day. There was no one else around to see it. She was initially excited when she saw it and immediately said yes. However, when she pulled it out and saw the chain attached, she accused me of trying to prank her, and wouldn't hear a word in edgewise. She was yelling at me and crying, and I felt horrible.

NTA (yet) but your story is odd.   You seem very caring, but why would she think you were pranking her?   Do you have a history of pranking her?

Don't think your fiance is either though-  \nYou were doing something that you thought was an interesting and practical idea, and you thought would be easier for her to wear.

You should sell those, like for real! What is she upset about? She can still wear it on her finger if she wants can't she?", "What you did was an extremely thoughtful and loving gift.

When I wanted my husband to propose, we had a number of issues (his family!) and he kept giving me vague answers, then would make jokes about me wanting to 'lock him down', which made me break up with him several times. An old friend would refer to his girlfriend as \"the shackles.\" Maybe she thinks this is a reference to the old ball and chain? IF so, that would explain it. Maybe you could have explained the chain before presenting it.\n\nEither way, you already have a communication problem, and you're not even married yet.", "Info- why would she think it\u2019s a prank?

You propose, she is extremely happy and says yes, you don't say anything about the ring, she picks it up and sees the chain.  Once she sees the chain, because you do joke around sometimes, she believes you tricked her and the entire proposal was a joke and gets extremely upset.  \n\nFor some women, a joke proposal would be a relationship breaker.  \n\n\n\nThis is s miscommunication that you need to get on top of.  Send s text with the full reasoning, call her mom, so something so she doesn't continue thinking the worst.   If after you communicate the purpose behind the chain, she doesn't apologize for her jumping to conclusions, then she would be TA, not before.", "ESH.\n\nIn my opinion, this could have been avoided had OP proposed with the ring separate from the chain, then talked to her and said, \u201cBecause I know that you, as a nurse, aren\u2019t allowed any jewelry to be worn on your hand, I got you a chain so you could still wear it at work but they won\u2019t yell at you for it.\u201d\n\nShe sucks because she didn\u2019t even bother to listen to his explanation.\n\nI may have given an E S H rating, but there\u2019s a little bit of N T A sprinkled in there.", "[deleted]", "INFO: Is it ugly?", "You\u2019re not necessarily TA, but I do think this was dumb and that if you had spoken with your girlfriend about her preferences for proposals, you\u2019d probably have already known that.

You could have just proposed to her with a ring on its own, then said later \u201cby the way, I know you can\u2019t wear rings at work so I designed this chained to be wearable with it if you do decide you want to wear it that way.\u201d That would have come across as thoughtful and creative.\n\nInstead, you proposed to her with some contraption that made it not feel like a proposal to her. And again, whether she overreacted or not I think if you\u2019d have spoken with her about what she wanted in a proposal at any point you'd probably have known she wouldn\u2019t like this. \u201cRing on a string\u201d definitely feels less like a proposal and more like \u201cI\u2019m not ready to actually propose but here\u2019s something to shut you up in the meantime\u201d, whether you meant it that way or not.", "Sorry but I\u2019m going to disagree with many of the posters.

I just think there\u2019s more here than \u201cshe\u2019s a nasty, selfish person who overreacted for zero reason.\u201d", "I think there\u2019s a saying- not all nurses are mean girls but all mean girls are nurses.", "Yes!", "Am a RN; can confirm.", "You didn\u2019t read the whole thing huh? He said she can\u2019t wear rings at work. So he got her a ring on a necklace so she can still wear it.", "Lmao my grandma used to say that. She also said there were two types of people who became nurses One was the kind of person who genuinely wanted to help people and be a caregiver and the other was the mean girl in high school who becomes a nurse for clout", "Every single girl from my high school that was a bully became a nurse. every single one. And you know they are going to be the type of nurse that tells patients that they aren't that hurt or will actively abuse elderly patients.", "It doesn't make any sense! Like dude why would you want to be somebody who has to take care of people for a living if your favorite pastime is making people absolutely miserable?", "Why is this? My mom was an RN for 45 years, and she is a very caring and sensitive soul. The mean girls of nursing ground her soul to pieces, and she almost had a mental breakdown before she reached retirement age due to the toxicity.", "Sounds like grandma was a smart lady!", "Some of mine became teachers. I really hope they have matured a lot or those kids are in for a rough time.", "You just answered your own question.  Being a nurse for elderly or otherwise vulnerable people gives you a great opportunity to make people miserable.  I mean, they're probably already miserable because they need medical care so very few people will believe the nurse is actively making it worse.", "I think about the one that's a racist and a teacher at least once a week. Disgusts me that she teaches elementary school.", "Most of mine became teachers! WTF", "Yeah that's the second profession mean girls go into. And most of them only become teachers so they can springboard into administration", "Oof. That's grim yo"]}
