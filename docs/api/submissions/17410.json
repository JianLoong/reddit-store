NTA (yet) but your story is odd.   You seem very caring, but why would she think you were pranking her?   Do you have a history of pranking her?

Don't think your fiance is either though-  \nYou were doing something that you thought was an interesting and practical idea, and you thought would be easier for her to wear.

When I wanted my husband to propose, we had a number of issues (his family!) and he kept giving me vague answers, then would make jokes about me wanting to 'lock him down', which made me break up with him several times. An old friend would refer to his girlfriend as \"the shackles.\" Maybe she thinks this is a reference to the old ball and chain? IF so, that would explain it.

You propose, she is extremely happy and says yes, you don't say anything about the ring, she picks it up and sees the chain.  Once she sees the chain, because you do joke around sometimes, she believes you tricked her and the entire proposal was a joke and gets extremely upset.  \n\nFor some women, a joke proposal would be a relationship breaker.  \n\n\n\nThis is s miscommunication that you need to get on top of.  Send s text with the full reasoning, call her mom, so something so she doesn't continue thinking the worst.

Which maybe puts you A territory, but moreso dumb partner territory in my opinion. \n\nAll of the elaborate ring on a chain nonsense didn\u2019t need to be included in the proposal. You could have just proposed to her with a ring on its own, then said later \u201cby the way, I know you can\u2019t wear rings at work so I designed this chained to be wearable with it if you do decide you want to wear it that way.\u201d That would have come across as thoughtful and creative.\n\nInstead, you proposed to her with some contraption that made it not feel like a proposal to her. And again, whether she overreacted or not I think if you\u2019d have spoken with her about what she wanted in a proposal at any point you'd probably have known she wouldn\u2019t like this. \u201cRing on a string\u201d definitely feels less like a proposal and more like \u201cI\u2019m not ready to actually propose but here\u2019s something to shut you up in the meantime\u201d, whether you meant it that way or not.", "Sorry but I\u2019m going to disagree with many of the posters.

Would you really want to spend that life with someone who thinks a ring is more important than YOU? for whom the \"wrong\" ring would be a deal breaker and something they're willing to throw the whole relationship away over? \n\nI feel like if you genuinely love someone they could propose with a literal bloody cheeto and it'd be good enough because the ring is just a symbol, an object, it's not what you're supposed to be excited about surely? \n\nHeck, a lot of couples pick out a ring together. My mother wasn't keen on the ring my step dad chose so they picked a new one together. No big deal. The ring my father proposed to her with was what he could afford but was impractical because it was too fragile and delicate. Once he had a better paid job they chose a new one together. \n\nthe ring is JUST a symbol, the marriage itself is the thing you should be focusing on surely? the whole spending your life together thing. \n\nright?\n\nIt sounds like OP genuinely thought hard about how to design a ring that would fit his partner. He took into account her job as well as her taste, which to me feels extremely romantic because it means he paid attention. He thought about it.\n\nHow many people do that? So many just buy a generic diamond ring that costs x amount because it's expected rather than putting a single moment of consideration for the person who will be wearing it every day for the next however many years. \n\nNTA op, this is a wierd overreaction on her part.

Also, the ring on a chain thing only makes sense in theory - in reality, it\u2019s usually a sign of trouble. \n\nOne last thing - the opals were not a great choice.

The silent treatment is also wrong. \n\nBut tbh, I also see few issues with what you did, even if it was well intentioned. \n\nFirstly, that chain sounds funny looking, mixing metals like gold and silver is not done often and usually for good reason. Plus you added the stainless steel core too, which I can only imagine is visible in some way as well. It might be sturdy, but is that a style of chain she would wear normally? \n\nSecond, how is it that the ring clips on and off? Is it not a continuous circle of metal? That sounds incredibly uncomfortable and pinchy . I also can't imagine it looks great. It probably looks like an adjustable childrens toy- not an adult engagement ring. \n\nThirdly- did she ever say this is the kind of ring she wanted? Or did you just want to give her a multi tool or something? An engagement ring is something she will wear everyday or at least many of those days for the rest of her life. She did deserve some input on what she would be comfortable wearing. And also, who says she would want to wear it on a chain at work? Maybe she would just want a silicone one for work and her nice shiny one for at home. Instead she has a franken ring that doesn't sound like it would be comfortable to wear because of the clipping part- and a chain that probably won't match any other jewelry she owns because of the mixed metals thing.\n\nTbh, if that what I had gotten I would be thankful for the thought and I may use it at work occasionally with a different chain (gah, mixed metals) but I would still want a normal, comfortable, noncliping engagement ring that wasn't a gadget. That's a piece of jewelry you treasure forever. It sounds like you put a lot of thought into creating a multi use ring, but didn't consider if she wanted a ring like that or a normal ring with the stones you chose. \n\nAlso, opals are NOT a good stone choice for everyday wear, she could easily damage them due to their softness and likelihood of cracking/fracture. And opals and diamonds are not cleaned the same way, same as gold and silver and stainless steal. Upkeep of that jewelry will not be fun or easy and it will probably look dirty very quickly because of what a process it would be to clean the stones carefully and dealing with that clasp will be annoying due to how easily it could break. Plus it appears to be plated? That plating will be gone so fast and will constantly need to be redone. \n\nAgain, the thought you had was beautiful, but that's not a very functional piece of forever jewelry. She's wrong for not speaking with you, but also not wrong to be disappointed or upset. I'm not sure why the jewler didn't talk you out of this tbh because it will be hard to maintain and it will be too fragile for everyday wear because of the opals.\n\n(And this is coming from someone who wears varying rings off Amazon that cost 12$ instead of the ring I was proposed too with due to that ring being fragile like hers. It\u2019s not necessarily about the cost of the item, but it\u2019s something that you wear everyday and it needs to function and be comfortable and easy to maintain and clean).\n\nEdited for spelling- my phones autocorrect is determined to get things wrong it seems.", "Unpopular opinion, but NAH (or a very soft nta at the most).\n\nThe soft nta because it would be very shitty of her to not let you explain yourself or believe you. But, it also sounds like it was a really emotional moment, so I can also see how it's hard for anyone to be rational in a moment like that.\n\nAnd I'm mildly sympathetic to her because, quite frankly, a lot of shitty boyfriends *do* pull fake proposal pranks on their girlfriends. Depending on her social circle and/or media diet - especially given the kind of stupid shit someone mindlessly scrolling through social media between shifts at a stressful job will get recommended to them - I wouldn't blame someone who was already emotionally vulnerable for jumping to that kind of conclusion, no matter how silly said conclusion is in hindsight.", "I definitely wouldn\u2019t throw the relationship away but goddamn would I have a hard think", "From your comments, this sounds like a misunderstanding.
