Your partner isn\u2019t telling you that you can\u2019t go, he\u2019s telling you that you don\u2019t have the money to travel. And it has literally nothing to do with his religion or lack thereof. This frivolity is NOT what emergency funds are for, particularly one that he\u2019s the primary contributor to. If it\u2019s really that important, ask your family to pay for your travel expenses.", "YTA\n\n> we don\u2019t have the financials right now\n\nThis was the only relevant line in your entire post.  When you can afford it, go.. doesn't have to be a random holiday.", "YTA because booking a trip like this a few days in advance is absolutely going to be more expensive and logistically complicated. This is something you can and should plan ahead for which would also allow you to budget. I live several thousand miles from my family and book plane tickets/visits a minimum of 6-8 weeks ahead.", "YTA, last minute plane tickets from Idaho to Florida cannot be cheap. This was not an emergency, so the EF shouldn't be touched. \n\n You should have planned ahead of time and budgeted for the expense.  Maybe you can do that now, and go see them for 4th of July or Christmas.", "YTA. You sprung it on him like last minute. Also, he's trying to make some financial security for the both of you and you instantly wanna use it for an unplanned ladt minute  trip only you think is important.", "YTA. It's not that he wouldn't \"let\" you see your niece, it's that neither of you could reasonably afford the trip. You wanted to spend emergency money on something that wasn't an emergency, and he understandably said no. He wasn't being spiteful, and religion had nothing to do with it.", "YTA\n\n\nA few days ago? You wanted to fly over to a holiday and didn't book way in advanced? To be a bit direct- you sound spoilt", "YTA, it's an emergency fund or a pet fund (you weren't super clear on that) but one thing's for sure\u2014 it's not a travel fund. I don't think boyfriend was being selfish, imo he was being practical about financials. Another thing, doesn't he not have a religion because he's atheist? That was confusing for me too. But yeah, emergency money is not travel money, and seeing your newborn niece for the holiday is not an emergency", "YTA. \n\nEmergency savings are for emergencies, not frivolities such as impromptu travel.", "Plane tickets are expensive, especially when booked a few days before the trip.\n\nYou knew you were about to have a niece from over a year before, correct? If you are close to your family, you must have known someone is pregnant. Why didn't you save specifically for this occasion?\n\nYTA. If you would have been fine financially, I would have understood you being upset. But YOU said you guys are struggling.\n\nAre you still in school? If yes, it's understandable that you can't yet handle things very well. If not, why don't you have a full time job as well?", "Yta what would happen if you spent the money and your dog need vet care? 'Oh well dog stop being so selfish?' \n\nAlso being an atheist doesn't automatically mean you don't celebrate Easter. I still do but Easter has only ever meant egg hunts, Easter baskets and spending time with family.", "YTA. It's an emergency fund. You're the one that is selfish. You don't have the financials to travel and want to take money from a fund that is not for travelling. I get that you want to see your niece. It's tough, you don't have the money to do so. That's life, sorry.\n\nNext time think about stuff like this way in advance and start a travel fund instead of calling a sensible person selfish.", "yta...... duh", "YTA - The funds weren\u2019t originally for travel purposes\u2026 totally makes sense for your partner to be upset about an unplanned trip using funds for anything else.", "YTA - You barely mention that the money is for a pet when it's an **emergency fund for your doggo that's getting old.**\n\nBringing \"his religion\" into this is just crass.", "I think you\u2019ve had enough people explain why YTA in this situation, so instead here\u2019s a suggestion I have: why don\u2019t you go without your boyfriend to see your niece? That in itself would cut the costs in half. Also you can book plane tickets in advance and not for a holiday, so they\u2019ll be way cheaper. I mean I don\u2019t know your finances, but that way you might be able to afford the trip without taking money from the dog fund.", "YTA,\n\nThis has got to be either fake or an incredibly delusional person.", "Dude YTA. It\u2019s not about him being atheist it\u2019s about you not having the money. Start saving for trips specifically for trips and you won\u2019t have these problems.", "INFO:\n\nIs there a reason why you haven't saved and planned for this trip in advance? You knew when your niece was going to be born and you've had ample time to save up, why haven't you?", "> I asked him if we could go for Easter a few days ago\n\nFor that, YTA. \n\nIf this is important to you and money is an issue (as in no *comfortably* money to spare), you have to plan a trip like this in advance and secure the necessary funds. You can not just decide a few days before that you want to take a trip you can't afford.", "YTA go apologize to your boyfriend.", "YTA. \nThe whole point of the emergency fund is to have money in case there\u2019s an actual emergency. Visiting your niece is not an emergency. \n\nAlso, he\u2019s the main one who put the money towards that. Why aren\u2019t you working full-time? You sound delusional. \n\nFinally, atheism is not a religion.  It\u2019s the absence of religious belief.", "Why do you write like that?\nEdit- YTA wtf", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You want to spend the emergency fund that you barely contribute to so you can go on a trip you can't afford? Emergency funds are for emergencies, not vacations. And you only asked a few days ago to go to Florida? When every cent counts, flights are not something you can do on a whim and certainly not something you can dip into your emergency funds for. This has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with you need to get a fulltime job and shape the fuck up with money real quick.", "YTA this is not an emergency, and he didn't bar you from going. He stated a fact about your finances. Get another job or work full time so you can save up enough money to do such trips. And apologize for calling him selfish, especially as it seems he not only handles bringing in most the money, but is in charge of managing it as well.", "YTA, you seem like an a person unworthy of a partner", "Agreed. While your strong desire to see your niece and family are understandable, you are selfishly putting that desire over your relationship's needs to be safe & secure.\n\nAs the commenter said, emergency funds are for emergencies, not family travel.\n\nIf you had gone and a real emergency had happened, how would you feel then? Would seeing your niece have felt as important as, say, a car accident requiring hospitalization, or one of you getting laid off, or your car breaking down, or one of any number of potential emergencies?\n\nThe only way out of not being called selfish is if the emergency fund is huge and the travel wouldn't have put much of a dent in that fund.", "It\u2019s not instantly, I put money into the account as well.", "Not gonna cover that fact that he wants to use emergency fund money for non-emergency travel?", "It\u2019s an emergency pet fund for our dog, he\u2019s old.", "His parents don\u2019t like to celebrate it.", "Is this how people on Reddit write??? \nNot the asshole though, you do you", "When I say he's trying to create some financial security I mean he's t4ying to create that emergency fund (no matter who's money it is) and be actually smart about it and not using it for this and that (sorry to call your niece this and that, but in a way she falls under that category).", "He*\n\n\nOp is a man. \n\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I didn't wrote an essay about everything wrong with that to your satisfaction /s lol", "Gotcha, thank you for clarifying OP! \ud83d\udc97", "and...?", "Okay, I\u2019m half awake and I misread it.
