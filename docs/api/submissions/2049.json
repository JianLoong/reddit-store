This one involved putting up a railing, and I was unaware that it would take as long as it did and was late to DND. I was also unable to text too much, just little snip its. One of my party mates, I will refer to as Amy, started to spam @ to me on discord. I quickly say \"I'm busy\" because that's all I have time to type. So the dm asks how am I busy, and I don't see the message because I am holding up the railing and not looking at my phone. So Amy starts to spam me again, but I holding the railing steady with the same leg I have my phone in the pocket of. So the vibration of my phone causes my leg to twitch and completely unaligned the railing. My grandma proceeds to to start yelling and getting pissed, which I understand this took forever to get set up, and I quickly text my party to \"Fuck off, I'm busy dipshits\". After I do so I shut off my phone so it doesn't happen again, and it takes another hour to get everything set up and drill all the screws in place. I turn my phone back on afterwards and Amy and the DM are pissed at me asking for my apologies for erupting at them. I do apologize but it feels wrong to me that they didn't apologize to me. After all that I wasn't in the mood to play DND so I didn't show and then Amy gets pissed because I didn't want to play. So after all of this Am I the AssholE?\n\nEDIT: Apologies for all this as this is my first post but I forgot a few key details. 1) The group is online. 2) When I was dm I never expected people to show all the time. 3) other people had been late but this hadn't happened to them.

Probably would get a ban in the future if you'd ever done any of that shit again, apology or no. \n\nThere's one rule at my table, that is pretty much the basis for all other rules at the table: respect everyone at the table. That means respecting their time by telling them ahead of time, even if it's only 5 minutes ahead of time, that you can't make it. It takes much less than a single minute to type out \"Sorry, can't make it today\", and you owe it to people who've carved time out of their day, set aside it to play with you, to tell them you can't make it. ESPECIALLY your DM. \n\nYou should know this as a former DM, for every hour of game played, there's at least 2 hours of prep, and that's a very conservative estimate depending how much love your DM is putting into the game.\n\nWhile I'm intimately familiar with how annoying spam pinging is, your eruption was absolutely unwarranted. Learn to take a breath and not blow your own shit (i.e. your grandma blowing up at you) at others.  \n\n\n> When I was DM I never expected people to show all the time\n\nDifferent DM, different standards. And frankly there's a difference between not showing up and not letting people know you can't make it.  \n\n\n>other people had been late but this hadn't happened to them\n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right. Just because others did something doesn't necessarily make it ok. \n\nTL;DR: Grow up, take a moment to breathe before getting angry, and for the love of god learn to respect other people's time and commitments.", "OP's alt is all up in this comment section \ud83d\ude02", "ESH \n\n\nYou probably should have warned them ahead of time that you couldn't come, before you started on the project. You didn't have to give details but still common courtesy is let them know they can start without you. \n\n\n\n\nThat said \"I'm busy\" is a full answer and the fact that they spammed you SO badly that you had to turn off your phone instead of continuing the game is ridiculous. I'd have told them to fuck off also.", "Maybe I'm just very socially anxious, but I can't imagine in a million years messaging my friends \"Fuck off, I'm busy dipshits\" and come away thinking \"why are these people angry at me?!\" Absolutely baffling.", "> In fact, you were questioned as to why you were busy and frankly, it wasn't their business. The fact that you said you were busy should have been suffice.\n\nI mean, no, it's absolutely their business if OP had previously committed to come, at least to figure out what \"I'm busy\" means for his ability to attend and how justified his absence was. Spamming him isn't great, but you're writing like it'd be wrong for friends to ask why you canceled on them, which is insane.", "I don't have any alts", "When the precedent already set is that not everyone HAS to be there to start and op has already told them \"I'm busy\" but they proceed to spam to the point that the vibration on her phone misaligns her project my response would also be Fuck off I am busy.  They are not entitled to her entire backstory about what OP was doing. I'm busy is a full response to inquiries about where you are when it comes to an ONLINE dnd session. Op should have warned them before she started the project yes but the second they started spamming OP to that degree after being told she was busy this became a hard ESH", "You know how DnD works. You had the phone in your pocket and could easily have sent a quick text saying 'Really sorry,  have to fix a railing, please start without me'. \n\nJust saying 'i'm busy' means nothing. Do they wait however long or start and then basically have to re-start when you show up? It's a massive pain. \n\nQuit acting like you're the only one who's busy or has a bad day. There's no main player in DnD or real life.", "It didn't \"all go to shit\". *You* made it all go to shit. That didn't happen on its own.", "Sorry you consider that to be insane.  I just think if someone tells me they're busy, it's not my business as to what came up.  The individual can tell me later if they choose to.  I don't need specifics because it may be something private or the person feels uncomfortable telling me.", "LMAO so THAT'S the comment you decide to reply to? \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\n\nInteresting.\n\n\nRegardless, you ARE the asshole. If you had the time to text (which you obviously did, because you DID text) you had time to be NOT A DICK and text \"sorry, busy, can't make it\"\n\nBut you didn't do that, did you? You opted for the dick path.\n\nYou're a BIGGER asshole for lying to us that you didn't have time to let them know. You had plenty of time to text, you DECIDED to be a dick when you texted.\n\nSO yes, YTA.", "But in case you missed it the first time, it is EXTREMELY suspicious how fast you went out of your way to claim you dont have an alt when there are so many \"INFO\" questions you haven't bothered to reply to.", "The question is though, when other people are late do they effectively communicate that they are going to be late or are you guys left sitting around wondering what\u2019s happening?", "I\u2019m busy isn\u2019t all the info needed tho? It could mean I\u2019m late- in which case everyone could wait to start. OR it could mean I can\u2019t make it, in which case everyone could start without OP. OP was being inconsiderate of their time and effort to be there.", "*precedent", "Its ESH at best imo \n\n\nThey did text relatively politely the first time the group asked. They said they were busy. That is a full sentence and op doesn't owe them further explanation. It makes it clear they won't be around or will be around late. Them spamming AFTER and demanding answers over an online DnD game make them AH also", "You can indicate that something is private or uncomfortable but still important. \"I'm busy\" is absolutely too little info, as it doesn't even make it clear whether or not OP will attend at all.", "This may come as a shock but the people on the other side of the keyboard and computer screen are real people too who also have a real life.   If you expect to continue playing and being friends with these people then you need to let them know when something comes up and to treat them with respect.\n\nThe problem isn't that he prioritized his grandma, it's how he treated his other very real friends.", "No often an I'm busy works", "Uhh no that's not how things tend to work in social settings like a dnd group. It does not make anything clear - does it mean they'll be a few minutes late? An hour? Not coming at all? It was disrespectful to not give any context at all. When im late for my game sessions ill at least give a ballpark estimate/tell them to start without me. Most everyone i play with does the same and the guys that dont respect other peoples time typically dont last long. And if OP doesn't like pings they are in full control of their notification settings. YTA", "Then make a new comment with your judgment.\n\nI disagree with you and I have no desire to argue. If you have a strong opinion, make your own comment.", "\n>I did tell them **after the fact.**\n\nIs that a joke?", "That's fair.  I agree with you on that \ud83d\ude42.  I'm just not someone who asks unless it has to do with something extremely important.", "But how far in advance do they communicate that? It sounded like everything was pretty last minute and they were waiting around for you. Like I get that you didn\u2019t know things were going to take longer. But if you\u2019re going to communicate last minute and then disappear for over an hour, you need to make sure your communication is clear. And like other people have said, I\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s no way you didn\u2019t have time for an extra 10 seconds to turn an \u201cim busy\u201d text into \u201csomething unexpected with my grandma came up that I have to help her with. Don\u2019t wait for me\u201d.", "I've been a DM for 6 years (2 online) and joined countless public campaigns including in conventions. I'm busy is a full response. Most campaigns have a buffer period of about 15-30 minutes for stragglers. After that point you proceed without them. The only time you need anything more than that typically is if your character is mid an important event because a session got cut at a bad time. The reason people who aren't considerate about time don't last is typically just because their character gets left to far behind. \n\n\n\n\nThey also explain that the precedent of not having to be there for these is already set back when they was the DM. Ideally you can say something like go on without me but they clearly had their hands full and could not offer that. Most campaigns have a protocol with this. When she didn't respond there was no reason to continuously spam to the point they did. Online DND does not take importance over IRL. If a person says they are busy you leave them alone. Full stop. ESH. I don't disagree that OP is an AH for not giving warning but responding I'm busy and getting spammed is unacceptable.", "Come on now, how was he supposed to tell them he wasn't coming before he knew he wasn't coming. Still YTA but let's be fair here", "It's like people who put on their turn signal halfway through a turn. Yes, I can see you're turning!", "Lol are \"you\" OP's alt?\n\nWhy are you being so combatively defensive when you could just post your own judgment and move on?", "How about when he realized he was not going to make it?", "\"after the fact\" sounds more like they just bailed and messaged way later to me", "He was sort of busy holding on to a railing as I understood", "For an hour?"]}
