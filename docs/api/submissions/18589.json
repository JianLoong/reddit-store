{"id": 18589, "submission_id": "13w1vgu", "title": "AITA for refusing to look after my step-nieces dog?", "selftext": "28f. I recently opened my doors to my SIL (husband's sister- 40f) and her Autistic daughter \"Sarah\" (10) after some financial hardship. They've been here 2 months. I wasn't about to see my step niece homeless, regardless of the heavy impact it had on my own home life (my husband and I have 4 kids). Sarah is \"on the spectrum\". I'm not going to sit here and pretend I know a wink of anything when it comes to Autism but since I don't know if any of it holds relevance, I figured I would mention it. \n\nNow when my SIL moved in they brought along this tiny Russian Chihuahua, that is Sarah's \"ESA\" dog. I firmly believe this is a sorry excuse to get a pet (in THIS situation) because Sarah acts like she hates the dog. The dogs whining overloads her and causes her to start stimming in bad ways (excessive clicking or banging her head on the wall). Well, apparently Sarah has no \"impulse control\". This is the excuse that my SIL is giving for the behaviors that have recently unfolded. Like my niece will walk up to me carrying the dog and basically toss the dog on my lap and say \"she's your problem now\". Or she will go to leave the house and immediately be like \"I'm not taking her so she's staying with you\". Call me weird, but I'm not going to give in to such an entitled attitude, regardless of age or disability. But again, my SIL says that this is because her Autism makes it so she has no impulse control. \n\nAnyways, she tried pulling this shit yesterday and this was after I already had a discussion with my SIL and her daughter about the entitled attitude and the fact that I was NOT going to assume responsibility over this dog. I don't even want a dog. There's a reason I did not have one. So she pulls this same shit listed above (ie: basically tossing the dog at me and saying \"she's your problem now\") and I ended up snapping. I said \"throw that dog at me one more time and I will personally make sure the dog isn't here when you wake up. Take your dog or I will get rid of her\". Sarah was immediately \"triggered\" and goes off in a rage to her mom. My SIL comes up to me and has the gall to get snappy with me, saying \"it would literally be so easy to just take the dog for a minute so my daughter can decompress\". So I responded with \"it would literally be just as easy to give the dog away since neither of you want her\". Now my SIL is pissed, saying I'm untrustworthy.\n\nETA: SIL is staying here free of charge. She and her kid get meals, a roof over their heads, hot water and wifi. I'm not assuming responsibility for their dog too, as I already discussed with them. Sarah will literally walk around her mother to throw her dog at me specifically.", "created_utc": 1685480205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w1vgu/aita_for_refusing_to_look_after_my_stepnieces_dog/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like I seen well train Chihuahuas that are **raised** to be ESA but this dog sounds like a tropical not train Chihuahua.", "There's no formal ESA certification -- but it does really sound sus.

My boundaries aren't going to be trampled for anyone.", "I'm autistic, and OP (/u/Different_Being_1780a)is in the right. The whole point of an ESA is to help the person emotionally, but that doesn't work if the person dislikes dogs, which seems to be the case here. The dog should be rehomed.", "My SIL doesnt even interact with her kid. There's not a single chance she would tolerate the dog.", "Sounds like my aunt and my cousin did.  Like the girls want chihuahua cause they saw movies and tv shows of these girls carrying their dogs in their hand bags.

There's no indication that this dog is badly behaved; she just shouldn't have a dog. The whining is probably from being neglected.", "The ESA aspect isn't sus---the daughter has a disability, and an ESA would be valid in that situation. The thing is *there is no point to an ESA unless the person actually likes that dog.* The whole point of the ESA is that the dog relieves emotional stress, which obviously can't happen if you find dogs themselves stressful.", "Thank you for clarifying that!

What\u2019s that? /s", "ESA are different from a service animal. ESA is just medically prescribed in places that have a no pet policy.  Service animals are actually trained for whatever medical aid is needed.", "notice I never once called the dog an ESA because, I very much doubt it is. But that still doesnt give OP the right to yell at a kid like that.", ">An actual trained ESA dog wouldn't be whining or causing her additional stress \n\nFalse. There is no training to be an ESA. Any regular dog becomes one when the person has documentation showing that they need one.\n\nThis dog doesn't even sound badly trained or badly behaved. The problem is that she probably just doesn't like dogs. In which case, no dog, no matter how trained, could serve the purpose an ESA is supposed to fill, not because of the dog, but because of her. And not all kids have to like dogs, just means they shouldn't have one as an ESA in the first place. The whining is probably from being neglected.", "YOU are meant to be an adult. You could easily tell said kid to take the dog to their mom instead.  Nope, you yell and show your own lack of impulse control.  And taking the dog for 2 minutes isnt being responsible for it, its helping a kid out who needs to calm down.", "Yes, I know. My company produced an entire documentary about dogs in the service programs. An ESA is supposed to provide therapeutic benefits (emotional support, comfort, companionship) to a person with a mental health or psychiatric disabilities. If this dog isn't providing these benefits, then it needs to be in another home where it is taken care of, as an ESA or just a regular dog because it isn't serving it's purpose and the child doesn't seem to be comforted by this animal in any way.", "OP called the dog an ESA dog, based on what she had been told. Also, she said she \"snapped\", that doesn't necessarily mean she yelled at the kid. OP is being taken advantage of here and it's within her rights to ask for respect in her own home. If this kid is walking past her mother to give toss the dog to her aunt, that's a huge sign of disrespect regardless of whether the dog is ESA or otherwise. Obviously this dog's purpose is to calm the girl, if it's doing the opposite, it needs to be sent back to a home where the dog is happy and the family with it is as well.", "There is no reason to doubt that it's an ESA. ESAs aren't service dogs; they're just regular dogs that don't have special training.", "You clearly didn't read a single detail in my post. I put right in the post that I spoke to both my SIL and Sarah about the fact that I was not going to be taking this dog and would not give in to the entitlement. She continued to push. Therefore I have had the conversation and I was blatantly ignored by both my SIL and her child. Again, it's my SILs job, not mine, to ensure her kid gets calmed down. Imagine trying to push entitlement that fiercely. Like \"oh you've opened your doors free of charge to two people and the mutt they don't want and you work full time while they sit around and eat your food but here, take on more responsibility because the kid you didn't birth depends on it because her own parent can't be bothered\".", "OP did act like an adult by discussing the issue with the child\u2019s mother and has been ignored. I\u2019d snap too.", "I don\u2019t disagree. The animal isn\u2019t doing anything remotely supportive and should be rehomed. I was just clarifying as others continually don\u2019t know the distinction and think ESA have the same rights as service animals.", "Your company producing a documentary on something doesn't make you an expert. ESAs are regular dogs that don't need training.\n>If this dog isn't providing these benefits, then it needs to be in another home where it is taken care of, as an ESA or just a regular dog because it isn't serving it's purpose and the child doesn't seem to be comforted by this animal in any way.\n\nI do agree here. My disagreement was only with the prior wording suggesting that ESAs have special behavior or need special training. But you're completely right that the purpose isn't being served here and the dog should be rehomed.", "In the moment, all you needed to do was turn, give dog to the mom and say to the kid \"Give dog to mom next time\" not yell.   \n\nI do not care if you do a dance for them every night to make the laugh, them staying there was also agreed upon by your husband, but yet you think you need to be patted on the back for this.  You seem to lack empathy.", "I've reached my breaking point. There's a huge difference."]}
