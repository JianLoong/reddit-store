We\u2019ve been friends since we were kids and are absolutely inseparable. We loved living together and she was a pretty good roommate.\n\nWell long story short about 6 months ago she got back together with an ex from high school and he is just\u2026 awful. He moved in with us (she didn\u2019t ask me first) about 4 months ago. Rent free of course. He was the messiest, loudest, and overall worst roommate you can imagine. \n\nI decided I was tired of this and moved back in with my parents but I was already planning on moving in August. I\u2019m moving to another city to live with my cousin but she\u2019s basically my sister as we\u2019ve lived together since we were kids because both of her parents passed away.\n\nHer dad died when we were babies and her mom died when I was 9 and she was 8 a few days after Christmas. That Christmas she gave me a mushroom ceramic dish that I loved because she also loved mushroom things. Her whole house was mushroom themed and she even had shoes with mushrooms on them. It was in the kitchen at the ex roommates house. \n\nPretty much everything in our house was mine. The washer and drier, couch, all of our dishes and kitchen appliances. There are a few things we went halfsies on and I\u2019m letting her keep those things, and the washer and drier because the apartment were moving into is already has them. I wasn\u2019t planning on getting it all until I moved in august so she had more time to buy all of those things. Did I mention she supports her boyfriends lifestyle completely which includes getting arrested and crashing her car so she\u2019s absolutely broke right now. She had to borrow $40 from me to pay her phone bill.\n\nYesterday I went over there to grab something while she wasn\u2019t there and found my mushroom dish broken, full of ash and tobacco from her boyfriend smoking a blunt. I texted her and she basically just said he did it on accident and \u201cshe thought I would forget about it and doesn\u2019t remember why she didn\u2019t throw it away\u201d.\n\nI decided I didn\u2019t want to risk anything else being broken so today I went and got my stuff, and i mean everything. I got every appliance, every dish (he\u2019s broken some of my mugs and shot glasses too), furniture, everything. When I told her she was pissed and told me it was petty and got mad at me for waking him up after he worked all night. Did I mention it was 2pm and he had the bedroom door wide open? My parents said I\u2019m being an asshole and are mad at me.\n\nI think what I did was justified because he very likely could have broken something else of mine. But my parents are both pretty disappointed and both her sisters texted me saying I was being petty. She\u2019s ignoring me. Part of me feels bad because she seriously just has an empty house now so I\u2019m asking Reddit.

My food and appliances were always used by them without washing. The food started innocently enough, he once texted for permission to use my eggs for baking. I said yes and they took it as free reign, letting their friends eat and drink my stuff. The thing that bothered me most was him chastising me for eating a donut of his, since it was quite a trip for him to go to that bakery.
