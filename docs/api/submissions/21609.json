{"id": 21609, "submission_id": "14tiq5p", "title": "AITA for getting all of my stuff out of my ex roommates house a month early?", "selftext": "I have been living with my best friend since I turned 18 so about a year and a half. We\u2019ve been friends since we were kids and are absolutely inseparable. We loved living together and she was a pretty good roommate.\n\nWell long story short about 6 months ago she got back together with an ex from high school and he is just\u2026 awful. He moved in with us (she didn\u2019t ask me first) about 4 months ago. Rent free of course. He was the messiest, loudest, and overall worst roommate you can imagine. \n\nI decided I was tired of this and moved back in with my parents but I was already planning on moving in August. I\u2019m moving to another city to live with my cousin but she\u2019s basically my sister as we\u2019ve lived together since we were kids because both of her parents passed away.\n\nHer dad died when we were babies and her mom died when I was 9 and she was 8 a few days after Christmas. That Christmas she gave me a mushroom ceramic dish that I loved because she also loved mushroom things. Her whole house was mushroom themed and she even had shoes with mushrooms on them. It was in the kitchen at the ex roommates house. \n\nPretty much everything in our house was mine. The washer and drier, couch, all of our dishes and kitchen appliances. There are a few things we went halfsies on and I\u2019m letting her keep those things, and the washer and drier because the apartment were moving into is already has them. I wasn\u2019t planning on getting it all until I moved in august so she had more time to buy all of those things. Did I mention she supports her boyfriends lifestyle completely which includes getting arrested and crashing her car so she\u2019s absolutely broke right now. She had to borrow $40 from me to pay her phone bill.\n\nYesterday I went over there to grab something while she wasn\u2019t there and found my mushroom dish broken, full of ash and tobacco from her boyfriend smoking a blunt. I texted her and she basically just said he did it on accident and \u201cshe thought I would forget about it and doesn\u2019t remember why she didn\u2019t throw it away\u201d.\n\nI decided I didn\u2019t want to risk anything else being broken so today I went and got my stuff, and i mean everything. I got every appliance, every dish (he\u2019s broken some of my mugs and shot glasses too), furniture, everything. When I told her she was pissed and told me it was petty and got mad at me for waking him up after he worked all night. Did I mention it was 2pm and he had the bedroom door wide open? My parents said I\u2019m being an asshole and are mad at me.\n\nI think what I did was justified because he very likely could have broken something else of mine. But my parents are both pretty disappointed and both her sisters texted me saying I was being petty. She\u2019s ignoring me. Part of me feels bad because she seriously just has an empty house now so I\u2019m asking Reddit.

Your parents wouldn't like it if you went around breaking their things.", "NTA\n\nThey knew you were moving in not that long, and they were destroying your stuff. Leaving it there means you would have lost even more.", "NTA It reminds me of the day my friend's long term live in boyfriend told her \"pack her sh!t and leave.\" We rented a U-Haul and when he was at work, we packed up all her belongings, everything she bought right down to the shower curtain rings. She moved this jabroni in without your consent, you packed up and moved your things because of an untenable living situation.", "NTA. It's your stuff, no reason needed.\n\n\nThe fact that you had a good reason is just unnecessary icing on the cake.", "NTA. It\u2019s only a month.", "NTA. So, let me get this straight. Someone spits on your face and you decide to leave (I would had actually reported him for all other infractions and not paying rent), and your \"friend\" has the audacity to reclaim something that belongs to you after taking the side of that piece of sh*t?\n\nI'm sorry, but that's a betrayal to your trust and all the stuff you did for her.\n\nYou don't need to explain yourself", "NTA. How much leeway are you *supposed* to give her boyfriend, whose residence in your home you never consented to, to break more of your stuff?  (I had a boyfriend like that. Lots of blunt smoking, lots of accidental breakage of objects of sentimental value, lots of gaslighting like *I* was the bad guy.) I can see why her sisters are texting you nasty messages, although not why you are reading their texts instead of blocking them on your phone. I absolutely do not understand what your parents' problem is. Your parents are assholes for not being in your corner *after you got baited and switched into a living situation you never consented to and weren't asked!!!* Based on your story, I'd say you cannot move to another city, away from them, soon enough. I hope you and your cousin will live together in harmony and peace and I wish you ALL the mushroomy things.", "NTA", "Nope nope nope nope, definitely NTA! If you would have waited any longer more of your stuff would have been broken. She chose him and his habits and if she\u2019s fine with them then cool. But if she can\u2019t see why you took all your stuff then she\u2019s love blind and not prepared for the storm she\u2019s gonna have of just him and her.", "NTA. Good for you for having boundaries and taking your stuff out.", "NTA, hope you took the washer and dryer too, you can sell them to cover the cost of the broken items you need to replace. 4 months of living rent free, bf should have plenty of money saved up to furnish the apartment.", "NTA.  She would just break more stuff.", "NTA you are absolutely justified. I am sorry she has lost herself to this leech. She has lost her capacity to give a shit about you evidence by, not asking if he can move in and pay a thid,\"she thought I would forget about it and doesn\u2019t remember why she didn\u2019t throw it away\u201d. She currently does not value you so yes, stop investing in her emotionally and financially. Those calling you petty is not experiencing her or your life. You are not a doormat to be stepped on. \n\nYou may find a replacement mushroom dish on ebay or etsy since sellers find and preserve such things. Now that your items are out of your rental create an awesome new life chapter.", "Removing the appliances before you move out may be a little callous under normal circumstances, but he broke an heirloom that you trusted *her* with but you never trusted *him* with. If I may speculate? It seems that you don't feel safe with this guy, so yeah. Definitely NTA.", "NTA petty would be taking the stuff she paid half for and the washer dryer set... Your fruend needs to get the wake-up call now  before BF ruins her life.", "NTA.  Breaking one of your cherished keepsakes is far over the line.  And your roommate was going to try to hide from you, but couldn't even get that right!  She needs to get used to being dumped by her friends - with her attitude towards others it will be a constant part of her future.  \n\nWhat I don't understand is why your parents were upset with you.  Is your roommate blackmailing them?  Tell the sisters that there is now a golden opportunity for them to step up and loan your ex-roommate all of their prized possessions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
