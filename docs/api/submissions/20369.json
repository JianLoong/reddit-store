Back in the beginning of my life, before the digital age, when everything was done with paper and pen, there were no issues in having a hyphenated last name. But as our society transitioned to digital problems began to arise, since EVERY SINGLE DIGITAL SYSTEM TREATS A HYPHEN DIFFERENTLY.\n\nFor example, lets say my last name was Smith-Martin.\n\nMy highschool's system was unable to process hyphens and cut off the hyphen and everything after it. So as far as my HS was concerned, my last name was Smith.\n\nMy college treated hyphens as spaces, so as far as they were concerned, I had 2 middle names and my last name was Martin.\n\nMy financial aid came from the government which actually had a system robust enough to handle hyphens, and as such they had my proper legal name, Smith-Martin on file.\n\nDo you know how many hoops I had to jump through to get my college who had me as Martin to accept my highschool transcript that was under Smith? And to get that linked to my financial aid that was under Smith-Martin? I almost lost out on my financial aid entirely because their computer systems wouldn't recognize me as being the same guy.\n\nThis stupid hyphen has caused me so much grief over the years, that I have seriously contemplated changing my name simply to remove it. Even today, in the year 2023, this is still an issue. There is still no unified way that computerized systems approach a hyphenated name. \n\nMost recently, I had to deal with my hospital which just deletes the hyphen making my name SmithMartin (one word), an outpatient procedure in a facility that treats hyphen as a space (so last name Martin), and my insurance that has me by my legal name, Smith-Martin.
