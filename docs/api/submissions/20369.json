Back in the beginning of my life, before the digital age, when everything was done with paper and pen, there were no issues in having a hyphenated last name. But as our society transitioned to digital problems began to arise, since EVERY SINGLE DIGITAL SYSTEM TREATS A HYPHEN DIFFERENTLY.\n\nFor example, lets say my last name was Smith-Martin.\n\nMy highschool's system was unable to process hyphens and cut off the hyphen and everything after it. So as far as my HS was concerned, my last name was Smith.\n\nMy college treated hyphens as spaces, so as far as they were concerned, I had 2 middle names and my last name was Martin.\n\nMy financial aid came from the government which actually had a system robust enough to handle hyphens, and as such they had my proper legal name, Smith-Martin on file.\n\nDo you know how many hoops I had to jump through to get my college who had me as Martin to accept my highschool transcript that was under Smith? And to get that linked to my financial aid that was under Smith-Martin? I almost lost out on my financial aid entirely because their computer systems wouldn't recognize me as being the same guy.\n\nThis stupid hyphen has caused me so much grief over the years, that I have seriously contemplated changing my name simply to remove it. Even today, in the year 2023, this is still an issue. There is still no unified way that computerized systems approach a hyphenated name. \n\nMost recently, I had to deal with my hospital which just deletes the hyphen making my name SmithMartin (one word), an outpatient procedure in a facility that treats hyphen as a space (so last name Martin), and my insurance that has me by my legal name, Smith-Martin.

I would make the same decision again, but a doubled surname is a monstrous pain in the a$$. It doesn't fit on any forms, noone can spell either my first or last names now and because it isn't hyphenated, literally noone in any sort of professional context, eg. Drs, appointments etc knows which of my names or both is my surname.

He's now actively making up drama about her family and pretending that different relatives have slighted him in some way and it's so clear he's trying to isolate her from her family. There were a few little red flags (he insisted upon asking her father if he could ask for her hand in marriage and when their dad had a medical crisis and was unavailable he asked her brothers. They told him point blank \"That's not anyone's choice but hers\") that seemed like small, possibly misguided and definitely outdated, but intended to be romantic gestures.

When a name change is important to a man it usually points to some other unfavorable opinions on women and what they supposedly \"owe\" men.

But I also think it can be nice for kids to have a choice of names, assuming the parents aren't AH about it. \n\nMy kid has both of our last names and I know that someday he'll probably drop mine BUT it was important to me to pass it on. It was misspelled when my ancestors immigrated (an Eastern European leader has what I believe was the correct spelling as the pronunciation is nearly identical, his name starts with a Z) so the only people who have my last name with this spelling are people I'm related to. Also, no one passed it on to anyone in my son's generation. My boyfriend has a relatively common last name that is the name of a city in the US and in the UK. it also has a coat of arms which is pretty cool too. \n\nWe both felt a strong desire to honor certain ancestors by passing on their last name that had in turn become our own names. So there are different reasons our son might want to choose either name but it will be entirely his choice. When I was younger I would not have chosen my last name, it's cumbersome, but I've grown to appreciate it for being incredibly unique. I would have preferred to have my mom's last name, which is my middle name, but I didn't feel right switching them. Having had two names to choose from as existing last names can have its benefits. But again, supportive parents who recognize the kid as an independent person able to choose for themselve makes a big difference.", "Damn that was longer than I meant it to be, sorry.

My ex ended up having a secret addiction and it got really bad, he becamse very abusive, and I had to have him removed by the police. It was bad enough that he was given a year in jail. I am so glad I didn't have his last name for that reason but also I can't imagine having given any more to him than he already took. He took and took and took from me but he never took my name away.\n\nEta: I'm sorry he cheated on you, that's so painful!

There's that.", "True that traditionally women changed their names but also traditionally women were viewed as property and the changing of the name symbolized the transfer from being property of her father to being property of her husband.
