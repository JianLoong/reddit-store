They got a puppy around a year ago and back then, it barked less frequently. However, its barking got really bad from noon to night recently. The other person living next door to this neigbour has a much older dog, and both the dogs would bark each other sometimes. However, what I observed is that the neigbour\u2019s dog would constantly bark non stop for hours when no one is at home (so it has separation anxiety I believe). It also barks when my family enters the backyard since the backyard door makes noise.\n\nTwo days ago at early afternoon, I hung a ultrasonic dog barking device on the outside wall of the house, directly facing the neigbour\u2019s house over the high fence. To be honest, I didn\u2019t think the neigbour would see it as the fence is around 2.5 metres high. Only a few hours later at evening, the neigbour were at my door, particularly the husband and wife. We had a friendly conversation, they were asking if their dog was too loud since they saw the device. I told them I will remove the device and they said no need to, but I did anyway. They said that they were still training their dog and that their other neigbour has a dog as well. They said they have security cameras with audio and check if their dog is barking. What confused me was that they were passive aggressively asking me when the dog was barking. I just said during the afternoon. It didn\u2019t seem that they were aware that it was an issue. At the end, they said they will more vigilant.\n\nMy family scolded me for hanging the device up and causing the neigbours to be \u201cfrustrated\u201d at us, especially my older brother who thinks the device will harm the dog (My brother is rarely in the house and his room is on the opposite side of the house away from the neigbour. My parents have also complained about the dog barking however\u2026). I doubted myself and thought I was overreacting to the barking. \n\nNow for the most part it has been peaceful up until this early afternoon, the dog is outside and has been constantly barking and howling for around 5 and half hours now. I checked outside and it seems like no one is home as theres no cars so it\u2019s probably barking from separation anxiety. I have tried the device again and it seems to not work at all, most likely due to it being too far away.", "created_utc": 1680068039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125ea5m/aita_for_using_ultrasonic_dog_barking_device_on/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I may have even felt differently if you had exhausted every other avenue and been blown off and this was a last resort. Communication goes a long way. \n\nThey suck for leaving a puppy/dog unattended for hours on end, not training it, and having no sense of being a good neighbor. My dog gets outside and gets worked up by the neighbor dogs sometimes and if he's being obnoxious I bring him inside and distract him. \n\nAll that said hopefully you can have a conversation, apologize, and find a solution that works for everyone involved.", "EDIT: After reading the comments, I\u2019m ESH leaning towards NTA. Mostly because if someone was potentially harming my animal, I\u2019d be upset too. You have a right to be annoyed and at your wits end with these people not able to get their dog\u2019s barking under control, you don\u2019t have the right to possibly hurt the animal to get it to stop. I would file a noise complaint with your local police instead.\n\nNTA I have a neighbor with a super annoying little dog that barks all the damn time, so I totally get it. People need to leave their dogs inside when they aren\u2019t looking after them, so that they aren\u2019t bothering everyone around them since they bought an animal they leave unattended for hours on end. Also what if it rains or storms and the animal is stuck outside miserable and cold? Tbh it doesn\u2019t really matter if the dog will then tear up their belongings, their dog their problem to address and deal with, not everyone around them.", "YTA for putting it up without confronting your neighbours first", "YTA.", "I feel like you should have called the cops instead of first resorting to a deterrent like that. I\u2019m sure the dog\u2019s constant barking violated some noise ordinances as it went on for hours at a time.\n\nYTA, just because you escalated this situation without giving the neighbors a chance to work on it. Even calling the police would have been a better first option.", "NTA. Hearing a dog barking incessantly is extremely annoying. It is the owner's responsibility to adequately see to their dog, which it appears they're not doing since they asked you when the dog barked. If they had a camera system with sound as they claim, they would be able to not only see exactly when the dog was barking, but also (at least potentially) calm the dog down vocally. The sound on most modern cameras works both ways. I'd report them since it appears that no one is home for a significant portion of the day. I mean, why bother having a dog when you're not home often enough to take care of it and train it properly?", "NTA . Im a animal lover \ud83d\ude0dhad a dog all my life and currently have a very chatty cat but I can deal with that . Hearing someone eles dog bark all day I would lose my damn mind !!! It\u2019s the only thing I like about living in a place with no yard lol no one can have a dog outside barking \ud83d\ude43", "YTA\n\n1) this device does not discriminate between the barking (happy, angry, frustrated, from anxiety etc) and punishes every barking.\n\n2) barking is a way of communication for dogs. Imagine someone would blow a loud whistle next to your ear every time you talked. Not so fun huh?\n\n3) major TA for having the first reaction of punishing another person's dog instead of talking with the owners about the problem.\n\n4) Yta for putting back the device even though you said you'd take it off. Even tho they said it's alright, you shouldn't go back on your word/actions.\n\n5) it's not your place to train another person's dog. \n\nThe owners said that they're still training the dog. Training does not mean that from one day to the next the dog will be perfectly trained. Training takes time and patience.\n\n\n\nTho the neighbors be also ta, for leaving it unattended for long.\n\nAnd your parents for not confronting the issue sooner.\n\n\nThe dog is NTA. It's a good boy/girl", "YTA- \nLet\u2019s start with this question, do you think you\u2019d enjoy having a loud screeching noise activate every single time you talked/panicked? \n\nYou stated this dog barks from noon to night, so that states it\u2019s during the daytime. Would you rather this dog bark during the nighttime?! Your neighbors told you they\u2019re still training the dog, but now I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve made them worried that their poor dog ,who is suffering from separation anxiety, has become a total inconvenience and annoyance to the neighborhood because you can\u2019t handle daytime barking? Not only that, but you\u2019re also punishing your other neighbors dog because a puppy can\u2019t stop annoying you?! \n\nYou want to know why they \u201cseemed like they didn\u2019t know their dog barking was an issue\u201d? Because it\u2019s not. Your neighbors are aware that dogs bark. Here they might\u2019ve thought it was at night and you tell them that it was the afternoon, now they know that you\u2019re just being an AH because you can\u2019t handle dog barks mid day. \n\nI don\u2019t think your parents are worried about your neighbors being frustrated. It doesn\u2019t seem that the barking bothers them nearly as much. This is an overreaction op. If the dog barking during the daytime TRUELY bothers you, please just invest in some headphones and leave the poor dogs alone.", "Edit due to information received: mild YTA. The dog is barking during the afternoon. While I understand that\u2019s annoying, that\u2019s a normal time for noise to occur during the day. It would be like complaining about kids playing outside or road noise or someone mowing their lawn. It\u2019s not happening in early morning or in the evening or the night. I don\u2019t feel any action was actually required because this is normal daytime noise. The neighbors don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem because their dog isn\u2019t barking outside of normal sound hours. I would understand it more if this was during the middle of the night, but it\u2019s not. \n\nInfo: what is this device supposed to do? Emit some sort of high frequency noise that somehow gets dogs to stop barking or something? You mentioned that your brother was upset because he thought it would hurt the dogs, but you don\u2019t clarify if it does or not.", "Your guilty of be non confrontational and  letting your neighbor walk all over you. It appears your neighbor understands your timid psychology and one knock on your door and you offered to take the  device down.  You should have complained directly to the neighbor when the barking became a problem. But since you didn\u2019t, you should have advised the neighbor that if they don\u2019t stop being  a nuisance that you would get a stronger device and point it at at their house.", "NTA but your neighbors are. The dog is a nuisance, and the neighbors are not training it. They are not even home to notice its barking. Call animal welfare next time and report animal abuse. It sure sounds like an animal in distress kind of issue, not a training issue.", "Hang it up and forget about it. If they can't control the barking, then the sonic device is the consequence of that. The hell if I'd listen to a dog barking all day.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents should've spoken to your neighbors. If they didn't control the barking then it's time to involve the authorities.", "ESH. I wouldn\u2019t have put the device out myself but then sharing your neighbors are definitely breaking a noise ordinance. Here it\u2019s if a dog barks nonstop for an hour or more it\u2019s disturbing the peace. It doesn\u2019t matter what time of day. My neighbors have had themselves called on because they leave their dogs outside all day. They\u2019re \u201coutside dogs\u201d and they barked ALL day and all night. They were forced to do something when the police came to their door. If the neighbors don\u2019t fix the situation call them.", "Yes, I agree after reflecting on what I could\u2019ve done. It would\u2019ve been best to communicate with them and inform that it was causing a distraction. Using such a device, whether it harms the dog or not, is wrong to do so since it\u2019s not my pet. Thank you for your insight.", "Disagree, having the police called on me would have escalated the situation way more than discreetly putting a device on your own property that you didn\u2019t even intend the neighbours to see", "Okay, I understand and respect your opinion. Personally, I feel like having police involved over some dog barking is excessive from point of view. Also, it might strain my relationship with my neigbours. I rather solve things by myself but I do understand where you are coming from.", "Since you say you love animals and that you had a dog all your life, you should know that barking can be for various reasons (anger, sadness, excitement fear, anxiety, happiness etc). Barking is just one of the dog's ways to communicate.\n\nPunishing another person's dog (without confronting them first) is absolutely TA behaviour.", "This is it. You took up the conflict with the dog instead of the neighbors, and tried to train someone else's dog with an indiscriminate device. You're treating the dog like a pest that you have to deter.", ">Imagine someone would blow a loud whistle next to your ear every time you talked. Not so fun huh?\n\nIf I were \"talking\" for hours on end, loud enough to be heard next door, I'd deserve it. OP is slightly AH for getting the device without first confronting the neighbor, but in my experience a dog owner that can't even be bothered to raise it right tends to get defensive when their dog's shitty behavior gets called out.", "You\u2019re completely unreasonable. The barking is a problem because he just said it was. You don\u2019t get to put this annoyance on people and decide they just have to deal with it. He doesn\u2019t have a dog, they do so why should he have to deal with hearing constant barking? And it was silly to say the bit about would he prefer it bark at night because obviously anyone would prefer the dog doesn\u2019t constantly bark at all. You don\u2019t get to be inconsiderate of others just because you like dogs. Please grow up", "No, this is not a canine worship world where we have to sacrifice our peace and equanimity so that a mutt can bark incessantly.", "Yes, I agree with your perspective that I it would\u2019ve been the best option to ignore the issue, especially it\u2019s not a dog barking at night. What I did was wrong. If I really wanted to take action, I should of asked the neigbours politely to somehow to get the dogs barking a little less. Thank you for sharing it.", "If I parked in front of someone\u2019s house and honked my car horn for hours on end would it be fine if it was the afternoon? No. You guys make excuses for being inconsiderate of others around you.

Using a deterrent like that, that only the internet says won\u2019t bother the dog, is not okay for someone else\u2019s dog.\n\nIt\u2019s a talk to the neighbor or a talk to the authorities. It\u2019s not your job to correct their dog yourself though.", "Imagine someone being annoyed by you talking when you're anxious.\n\nOP certainly didn't think her actions through.\n\n\n\nDogs like many animals experience a wide variety of emotions. Punishing them for expressing these emotions is cruel.", "The difference between a dog and you, is that people can talk and you'll understand to not talk that much, you understand the social queues and when to not be loud etc\n\nAnd how is OP 'slightly'?

Eventually the dog gets used to it and it stops working most of the time.\n\nJust use the device. The dog will be fine and potentially quieter.
