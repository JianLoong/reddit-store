That I didn't mind so much.", "right, that's why i didn't label her an asshole.  but like OP pointed out, it's nice to partake in these sorts of events.  That's why i said it would be nice to take a turn hosting a wedding type party when she's enjoyed other people's weddings.  offer her loved ones a chance to partake without having the stress and financial cost of hosting.  It's often nice to do things we aren't obliged to do.", "Don't ruin a good thing", "I think they\u2019re fine any time you\u2019ve lived through something and both emerged changed people from it. This can include \u201craising children\u201d as that lived-through experience. But too often it\u2019s a last-ditch effort to \u201csave\u201d something that isn\u2019t there anymore", "Oh brother. I can understand your friend wanting to celebrate you and therefore being a little sad at not having been able to do so in the traditional sense. However, if she truly wants to celebrate you, then she hopefully can be receptive to doing so in a way that YOU choose, if you even want that. NTA.", "NTA. You can have a less forma celebration (if you would like). Just have a nice dinner at a restaurant, to celebrate, no wedding dress (maybe a nice dress if you\u2019d like) but just that! It does not need to be a huge thing either.", "We went to the court house and then to Costa Rica for 2 weeks.", "NTA - Also been married 20+ years (22) and did not have a wedding. To me, it was a really private moment between me and my husband and I actually had no interest in other people being involved. I'm a firm believer that a wedding is for the people getting married, it makes me really sad to see people getting all worked up about meeting someone else's needs for a wedding.", "NTA- JFC, friend or no friend she had no right to say that to you. You don\u2019t owe anyone a wedding and you did what was comfortable for you and your husband at the time and that made you happy then good for you. If you would like to have a party celebrating your 20th anniversary and invite all your friends and family then go for it if not then don\u2019t. Don\u2019t pay any more attention to the silliness of other peoples opinions of your life.", "NTA.  My mom would love you & your post, she\u2019s a big supporter of \u201cjust elope\u201d because all the stress of planning a wedding ain\u2019t worth it. \n\nIf you decide you want want to do something to celebrate your 20 year anniversary (congratulations!!!!) - just have a party.  Maybe a potluck?  Maybe rent a room at a restaurant and have them cater?  Maybe catered at someone\u2019s home or a \u201chall\u201d that you can rent?", "Rofl!!! Owed!!!! Excuse me? She did what she wanted to do. You did what you wanted to do. Case closed.", "NTA. Tell your friend you did everyone a favor by NOT having a wedding. Saved them the trouble of finding an outfit and sending a gift.   \ud83d\ude02", "What? No, that\u2019s loopers. By that metric, DH and I would have had to have an enormous wedding inviting everyone in his Very Large Family (Irish Catholic ftw) because he owed it to the family after being at all the aunts and uncles weddings as a child. We didn\u2019t do this because it\u2019s not our style. The idea that you have to have a wedding is mad. \n\nNTA", "Everyone is entitled to their point of view. Except your friend. Her point of view is just dumb. NTA.", "Your friend has come up with her own ideas for why a person should have a wedding. You don\u2019t have to share those views. Hopefully she enjoyed her wedding, but you made it clear that there is a lot about a wedding that you would not enjoy. Only have a wedding if you someday want to. NTA", "NTA! Nobody is *owed* a wedding. Your friend is being ridiculous. Please don't put yourself through the hassle of a vow renewal unless it's something *you* want to do for *yourselves.*", "NTA Tell them that they can buy you wedding gifts any time they wish.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe anyone a damned thing. Nobody is owed a wedding if the couple doesn\u2019t want one!  These people are getting more ridiculous each year!", "NTA. You do you.", "NTA. Nobody owes anyone a wedding. You don\u2019t take advantage of anyone by being a guest. Couples must like to have as a guest since you get invitations.", "NTA.  You hold the wedding you and your spouse want, not the one that the crowd wants.", "\"*I'm sorry that you feel that way and while I appreciate that you wanted to celebrate my and my husbands marriage when it happened, I absolutely did not 'owe it' to anyone to have a wedding if, ultimately, it was something I and my husband decided we did not want to go through the stress of planning and paying for - regardless of my attendance to other peoples weddings.\"*", "NTA, and I find it really strange that your friend brought this up after 20 years? You don't owe anyone a celebration. If you and your husband really want one, fine, but don't feel obligated to have one based on your friend's weird comments.", "NTA. She\u2019s being really silly.", "I eloped bc it felt like everyone tried to make my wedding about them instead of the marriage. You don\u2019t owe anyone anything - you and your spouse made the best choice for you!\n\nNTA", "NTA\nYour friend thinks you owed her to have a formal wedding party? And still brings it up 20 years later? Wow. The woman is delusional.", "yeah not sure what her deal is. she brings it up in subtle ways like \u201cdon\u2019t you wish you had a beautiful wedding and beautiful pictures and video like me?\u201d (my mom took photos of us at our wedding. they came out pretty good). \n\nshe doesn\u2019t say it flat out but like always makes it seem like she cares about me and that no woman should be without a nice wedding. she did offer to help plan; but I am scared because during her own wedding I was in her bridal party and she was a control freak.  she has this power over me, like she will say something and then I think about it for a long time. sorry.", "sorry but it will not be me! lol. what made me say \u201cabsolutely not\u201d was when I went into a bridal shop to look at a dress and the salesperson there was like \u201cwhen is your reception\u201d and when I mentioned I didn\u2019t reserve anything yet, he told me to come back because reservations take a year. and I thought man, a lot can happen in a year. I want to get married now. so we did. I liked it.", "yes!!! so true. I do enjoy company. just can\u2019t deal with the event planning. I like small groups where I can talk to people", "your in laws sound awful. and kinda like my friend. I really dislike this \u201clet me tell you what you like\u201d attitude", "you\u2019d think , right? I joked with her once that if we divorce our husbands and decide to get married, I will let her plan our wedding. lol. (afaik we are both straight)", "Now I\u2019m questioning if I should have made my Gram get married after I did. I wasn\u2019t born in time for her first wedding. She owed me!", "getting married in antarctica with penguins sounds cool. both figuratively and literally :)", "If it aint broke don\u2019t fix it", "Yes you did, just not traditional church vows!"]}
