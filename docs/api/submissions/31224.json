Your wedding is about you and your husband, not about fulfilling other people's expectations. It's understandable that planning a wedding can be overwhelming, especially with other commitments like starting a masters program. If a vow renewal feels right for you, go for it, but don't feel obligated to do so. Your friend should respect your decision and not impose her own feelings onto your personal choices.", ">I kind of \u201cowed it\u201d to them to have a wedding. \n\nAbsolutely not. You should only have a wedding if **you** want to and are up for it. You didn\u2019t and weren\u2019t. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your friend sounds a little crazy. It's been nearly 20 years and she's still upset that you didn't throw a party when getting married? That's so weird. You could throw a party for your 20th anniversary, but only if you really want to. I wouldn't do it to appease anyone else. \n\nMy husband and I got married while on vacation in the Bahamas and our witnesses were off the beach.  No party was ever thrown. People should be allowed to have the wedding they want.

It\u2019s a done deal! \n\nYour friend was \u201churt\u201d that you didn\u2019t have a big wedding? Well, that\u2019s a *her* problem. You don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d anybody a damn thing. \n\nAnd WTF, you haven\u2019t \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of anybody for being a guest and enjoying the weddings you have attended! I\u2019m sure you gave a nice gift, as is customary, and were properly dressed and well behaved. That\u2019s all you \u201cowe\u201d the people whose wedding you attend. \n\nI roll my eyes. NTA", "If she wants you to have a wedding, she can plan one and pay for it.  NTA", "NTA\n\nOh my gosh, you got married the way you decided was best 20 years ago. Also planning is anxiety provoking for you. I can't believe you would consider doing that just because of a friend wishing you had a bigger wedding 2 decades ago. Just take a nice trip with your hubby. Marriage is not about other people's expectations.", "NTA. People have weddings for lots of different reasons. Just because your friend had one so she could include all her friends doesn\u2019t mean you should have done the same.\n\nIf you and your husband wanted to do a vow renewal because you wish you\u2019d had a traditional wedding, that\u2019s one thing. But you\u2019re not obligated to hold a traditional wedding now any more than you were back then.\n\nEdit: Also, this was 20 years ago. That\u2019s a long time to be hanging onto the idea of attending your friend\u2019s wedding.", "NTA. No one has to have a wedding, it's just a way to invite a lot of people to witness instead of whatever close friends and/or family are present at a civil ceremony. You don't \"owe\" anyone a big wedding party just because they had one and you attended.\n\nEdit: 20 years is a long time to hold onto resentment because they assumed you'd be doing a big wedding with all the trimmings. That assumption is on your friend, not anyone else.", "Your friend can go plan herself a fine hullabaloo and leave us introverts at home. NTA", "NTA. I feel like your friends have all mutually benefitted from you attending their weddings and them not having to attend yours in the sense of gift giving, dresses, travel, etc. lol.", "You aren't an asshole, but I will say weddings aren't just for the bride and groom and it's nice to take your turn to host the family reunion/host the old college or childhood friend reunion/host the party where people can take their fancy dating app profile pictures, etc... They serve a function for everyone, it's nice to take your turn to host and eat the cost. Like you said they can be stressful to plan but you enjoy taking advantage to other people's planning. It's nice to have someone else take a turn with the stress rather than take it on oneself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not sure I can do it. I wish we had enough money to hire a wedding planner, but we definitely don't. I really want my family present; they mean the world to me and my dad even wrote me a song for it. But I can barely plan an afternoon get together with friends and I can't make decisions to save my life, how the hell am I going to plan a once in a lifetime event? Whenever anyone asks me anything about it, I immediately feel anxious and don't know what the hell to do. I did however, magically find and purchase my dress. \n\nSorry for using my response to vent... but while I'm here, does anyone want to plan my wedding for me?? \ud83d\ude29", "Lol, you OWE it to others to have a wedding?! That is utterly ridiculous. Sounds like your friend us bored and needs a hobby.  NTA", "NTA.  You did have a wedding.  You had the wedding you and your husband wanted.  No one has to spend thousands of dollars on an event that they don't want in the first place.", "Wife and I had two witnesses at town hall. Poof we were married. Mother-in-law wanted a wedding so she paid for it. Most if the planning was easy. What ever mother-in-law wanted. We showed up and did what we were told. Now we have two anniversaries. I think the difference here is the family connection and the funding. I don't think we would have had a separate ceremony without funding or the motivation to appease the mother-in-law. If anyone else has asked we would have laughed. That ship has sailed.", "NTA. it\u2019s not about them, it\u2019s about y\u2019all.", "NTA\n\nThat's absurd. You don't owe anyone a ceremony.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe anyone a wedding", "NTA\n\nWe did a micro wedding and it was perfect. Prior to that, my SILs took on themselves to start planning, they each picked out \u2018bridesmaid dresses\u2019 that were all awful and vastly different\u2026 I hadn\u2019t even spoken to them about the wedding yet. Gave me such bad anxiety that I threw up at SILs home.\n\nMy SILs insisted that we couldn\u2019t do a child free wedding. It would have been 40+ people just with my in laws and their kids and partners. \n\nMy husband tried to get them to back off. My step daughter (24) also tried to get them to back off.  (She was our MOH, best man, flower girl and ring bearer all in one.)\n\nBut my friends\u2026.. my friends and family except for one- were lovely. They said - whatever makes you happy. Even the ones who invited me to their very small weddings. They even threw me a bachelorette party (dinner at a nice restaurant, no penis hats for this girl.)If they were hurt, they never let me know and I saw no signs of it. I see this as a sign of the quality of people I have in my life. \n\nMy in laws though. Holy shit. My husband put his foot down and told them they weren\u2019t invited. They hadn\u2019t listened to him or me about what we wanted. He told me that he felt like they were just going to use us to get drunk and rowdy. \n\nAfter the wedding, my husbands ex told me that I dodged a bullet. She said at her wedding, his mother (my new MIL) told her she looked too fat to be getting married. She was pregnant at the time.\n\nAnyways- you do you. There is no quid pro quo here. People who get you will understand. People who complain probably are rather toxic situational friends.", "Eloping is a thing. NTA for having the type of commitment/marriage ceremony of your choice. You don\u2019t owe anyone a wedding or party just because you tied the knot.  If she wants one so bad for you tell her to organize and pay for it. Lol.", "Coming back bc my petty wants to be heard. Take her to a car dealership* (or Prada or something else pricey). Fuss over the merchandise and insist she pick out her favorite. Once she does, invite her to go pay for it. \u201cWhat?

Congrats on 20 years!", "NTA. \n\nAnd I bet your friend is going to be a challenging future MIL! \n\nYou don\u2019t have a wedding to make other people happy. That may be a consequence (bringing joy to others via the celebration) but it is not the reason to have a wedding.) \n\nJust wow.", "NTA.  It's your wedding, do it how you want, and you did!\n\nMy husband and I eloped, for pretty much the same reason, I didn't want the stress of planning a wedding.

Some want to celebrate it with hundreds around them, close family and friends, or duck out and celebrate it as two people. \n\nI\u2019m with you, any event is a lot of planning and work. My ex and I ducked out of our wedding early, we were tired and quite frankly kinda over it by 8:30/9pm. \n\nIf your friend wants to celebrate something, they could easily host a nice dinner one night and be like \u201cwe didn\u2019t get to celebrate your wedding, so we\u2019re celebrating your 20th\u201d.

Party planning makes you anxious, and that's a good enough reason not to do it. Your attendance at the weddings of others doesn't constitute a promise to have a wedding of your own. You honor your friends by attending their weddings, and you bring nice presents. They should be happy with that. Also, if they're really friends, then they should understand that certain things make you anxious and not pressure you to do those things.", "NTA.

It's literally none of their business lol", "Your friend is complaining 20 years later that she felt really let down because you didn't have a formal wedding? That's just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Tell her that her village is missing its idiot and they want her to go home.", "You don\u2019t owe anyone a wedding. If they invited people to their wedding so they can get invited to free parties in return then they\u2019re shitty friends.", "Vow renewals always seem so contrived... and lead to divorce. Lol. It's also just awkward/cringe.\n\nI'd just throw an anniversary party if you feel like it.\n\n As a guest, I'd rather just go to an anniversary party and witness some sweet toasts from the couple to each other than see vows renewed. \n\nOp, you seem to enjoy these things, but find the planning stressful, so just hire a party planner and let them do the work. Scratch the wedding, you did that, just have a party to celebrate 20 good years together \u2764\ufe0f"]}
