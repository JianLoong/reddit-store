Yes, children with special needs need special care, but forcing others to involve them is not a good way. Surely John also did not have a good time.\n\nI am sorry for you and after all that happened I see why you don't care anymore...", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you were rude to him, right? You just told your family you weren't happy he ruined your birthday, and okay then you made the rude comment to your family about his lack of friends. You weren't being a brat by not wanting your birthday ruined by behavior issues. You can be kind at school, but that doesn't mean at 14 you have to invite every single person to your party", "NTA\n\nBeing special needs does not justify this awful behaviour. The kid's parent should have known better and taken him to calm down.", "NTA disabilitys and other special needs don't mean you can be a asshole it sounds like you were nice allowing him there maybe. The special needs kid could have benefited from a parent there to help watch him. Also while not all special needs people can learn everything most can grasp the basics like respecting turns and such. I hope there parents have passed that on. As some can use disabilitys as a excuse to not cover things like that", "NTA.  Your mom has her head firmly lodged up her own ass.", "NTA His mom probably asked or guilted your mom into inviting him.  I agree, there\u2019s a reason he has no friends.  Sorry about your birthday.", "NTA: nobody should force anyone to pretend to be someone else's friend.", "Happy Birthday! Here's a brand new cake \ud83c\udf82.", "NTA. Your mom had no business forcing his company on you and ruining your birthday.", "NTA - can you live with your grandparents?", "NTA. \n\nHonestly the mother of the SN child is the AH. Your Mum too.\n\nMy brother has multiple special needs and we don't allow him to behave in that way. So many parents get a diagnosis and just assume that means they can use it to explain away poor behaviour and use it as an excuse to allow their kids to do whatever but that's not how that works.\n\nI understand from the other side that it's hurtful when my brother gets excluded. But that's actually pretty rare with the community he's built up because he's been taught how to behave.. obviously there are hard days but generally he behaves in a way that is considerate to others. And when he has a day where he is not able to do that, we remove him from the situation.", "NTA\n\nBeing an asshole isn't a disability. People need to stop enabling John. Most of these stories about special needs kids behaving like brats are caused by lack of proper parenting and not by their actual disability.\n\nYour mom also needs to stop being a pathological do-gooder. If she wants to be nice to John, she needs to do it at her own expense, not yours. Invite him to *her* birthday and see how she feels about it. Same goes for your aunt who needs to shut the fuck up.", "NTA but I have a response that might shut your mom up. \n\nI'm sorry for how I acted but we can't treat John like a pity friend just because he has special needs. That's an insult to everyone with special needs. He is not a lost cause and and sooner or later, he will face some serious consequences for what he does. He can hurt someone. isn't it better for him to get help first to control his issues then invite him to stuff? If I have to see him again I will be polite, but that's the most you can ask from me.", "NTA, my brother goes to a special school and if someone\u2019s acting up like John was they get told off immediately (with an understanding of their condition ofc). Therefore, you have every right to feel annoyed that people are excusing John\u2019s actions \n\ni do wonder what Johns parents are like at home with him, sounds like he doesn\u2019t get sanctions or anything like that", "NTA. W grandparents too.", "NTA you have ever right to be irritated. My cousin is special needs, he can be a bit of a pain sometimes but his parents make sure to actually parent him so he behaves pretty damn good 90% of the time. His parents need to step up, I know parenting special needs children is difficult and tiring. I\u2019ve watched my aunt and uncle do it and they\u2019ve done it well so I know it\u2019s possible.\n\nMy only advice is to be a bit gentler. You\u2019re young so your feelings are going to feel much bigger especially during an important event to you, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I say this because I\u2019ve been in similar situations and getting older, I look back and think about how I would\u2019ve been less harsh. I know it\u2019s easier said then done too. This child\u2019s behavior is the fault of his parents, he knows he can get away with it and so he does it but depending on what his mental handicap is, he may not even know it\u2019s wrong just that his parents act like it\u2019s okay.", "NTA - you're 14, your mom shouldn't foist people on you for your birthday parties. When you're 5 or maybe 8, sure. 14? Nope.\n\nSome people can handle special needs, and some people can't - you don't have the maturity of looking past this kids issues and it sounds like he wasn't socialized enough to behave well, but it's not your fault. You're 14.", "You are NTA but your mother and that kid are.", "NTA. Belated happy birthday tho.", "NTA.  Let your mom know that she will not be hosting or otherwise involved in planning of your future parties - birthdays, graduations, life events, etc.  Plan these yourself with your grandparents.   Mom ruined your party with her pity for an undisciplined child who suffers from non-parenting parents.  Good parents know their kid, ensure their kid is a welcome guest, and the kid acts appropriately.  Bad parents put an undisciplined kid with sensory issues in loud places without headphones and allow their kid to bully others.", "NTA\n\nLook you're young, your mom was just trying to include a kid that doesn't get included. She's probably friends with his mom.\n\nHOWEVER very sadly this child does not appear to actually be a peer to you. He wasn't able to respect he was at someone else's birthday party which means - he shouldn't have been there. Your mom fucked up. You know who fucked up more though was poor John's mom. She needs to get this kid real help not sending him to birthday parties he's not ready for.\n\nI'm sorry your birthday was ruined OP. Sounds like you have kick ass grandparents.", "NTA", "NTA!\nYour mother went against your wishes even though you kept telling her that you don't want this certain individual at your party. She really doesn't take your feelings seriously and literally tries to be nice to watch other people who aren't her children. Seriously your mother needs a major reality check and realize that \"oh wait! I'm going to respect my child's wishes and don't invite people over that she doesn't feel comfortable having over. \" No wonder your grandparents stood up for you and your mother shouldn't take advantage of your birthday let alone having some child who is special needs to throw a massive tantrum just because he didn't get any cake and thinking it was his birthday when it was yours from the start. Your mother really needs a major reality check on top of that because she shouldn't be telling you don't be mean and don't be nasty and stuff like that when it's your birthday and she brought over someone who apparently has special needs and disobeyed your wishes when your grandparents have the right to straighten her ass out and realize the cold hard facts that she brought a disruptive kid to your birthday over to their house and destroyed everything. Literally your mother even grounding you for 2 weeks just because you weren't doing anything wrong that is not right. Also, it looks like you need to pack up your stuff and get the hell out of that house of yours and move in with your grandparents. They literally took your side about the birthday fiasco and they literally yelled at your mom about the situation. Also it looks like the special needs parents or your mom really owes your grandparents a new table", "NTA.
