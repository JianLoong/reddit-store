But that's actually pretty rare with the community he's built up because he's been taught how to behave.. obviously there are hard days but generally he behaves in a way that is considerate to others.

That alone was not ok. Second it was your party. It should have been about you and it wasn't. They should have just thrown a party for John cause they certainly didn't throw one meant for you. \n\nHonestly it sounds like your mom just wanted to be seen as inclusive and she sacrificed your moment so she could be seen as a hero who includes disabled kids. She sadly just didn't care if she had to sacrifice something special to her kid to get that image. Then when John had a meltdown cause shitty parents putting him in the worst environments he could be put in she doubled down and took it out on you. \n\nYou didn't deserve that and Im sorry your party got ruined kiddo.", "NTA\n\nThis kid clearly has autism, and high support needs at that. Your mother should've researched autism and how it effects autistic people. When he complained about the music, he was experiencing sensory issues. Your mother should have accommodated him.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to note is that it was YOUR birthday. She had no business inviting a kid you didn't like. The fact that she invited him out of pity shows how much she infantalises autistic people, which is upsetting to see. It seems your mother wanted some sort of \"hero complex\" for inviting this disabled kid, making her look good and furthering the gap between autistics and non-autistics by alienating them.\n\nI would like to mention that autistic people aren't stupid, they just see the world very differently and have physical symptoms such as sensory issues that can be very exhausting to live with. Often when autistic people have meltdowns they are overwhelmed with sensory or emotional input. You're 14, meaning this kid has been in the school system for a while. Unfortunately the school system is very ableist and often traumatises autistic kids like John, so i suspect he was lashing out in defence due to previous bad experiences.\n\nI have autism, with medium support needs, and I used to be like John, I would misbehave and lash out in class due to past trauma too, but if you'd treated me the same way you treated John, I wouldn't blame you. Its not your problem to deal with. I'm sorry your mother invited this kid to your party out of pity. It wasn't fair on you or John\n\nI see your frustration, I really do, but you shouldn't insult his amount of friends. Autistic people struggle with social interaction and making friends due to cognitive differences and it is really difficult to live with, that was a very low blow, and I think you could benefit from researching autism and how to avoid ableism. I am not calling you ableist, but considering how your mother pitied this kid, its best you try your best not to pick up her ideologies \n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday and it should be all about you. Having special needs is not an. Excuse to ruin it for others. If they can\u2019t control his outbursts over small stuff there is no reason he should join a party and ruin it for others.", "NTA.

Your mother is an unimaginable asshole in this situation", "Invite him for your mothers birthday", "NTA, and your mum had 100% already invited before she suggested it to you and instead of having the balls to cancell she doubled down and forced the issue.", "NTA his parents are at fault. His behavior was not okay and to ask any child to be okay with it is too much. Your grandparents understand it is a lot to ask for another child to understand and put up with it. It sucks your grounded but you were not wrong.", "NTA I always wonder why people say \u2018don\u2019t treat him like he\u2019s the worst he has special needs\u2019 and expect you to go \u2018oh I\u2019ll just let him ruin my birthday\u2019 your mum was enabling him, I\u2019m not sure how she thought any of what he did was good, hoping she gets her head out of the gutter soon", "NTA she fucked up your bday and not only didn't apologise grounded you for expressing your feelings to her about it, she did good to the special needs kid at your expense and that's not okay. Your grandparents sound like the only reasonable people here.", "1.happy irl cake day\n2.Nta I would have done the same.", "NTA. Adults in John\u2019s life like his mom and your mom are actually killing any chance of him having friends by encouraging his entitled behavior by permitting it like this, and forcing him into social situations he is not ready to behave in like this will only increase his social ostracism and create resentment among his peers (you are a prime example of this right now). Since we don\u2019t know him or the extent or specifics of his disabilities I obviously can\u2019t say for sure, but in many cases he probably is capable of learning to behave better but likely doesn\u2019t know to do any better because his parents allow it. He may not even realize he\u2019s doing something wrong since mom permits it and especially with other adults reinforcing that. If he genuinely is unable to develop to that level of either social awareness or self-control, though, forcing him into these environments he cannot handle and where the attention needs to be on someone else is unfair to both him and the people being forced to bear the ramifications. Being disabled is not a free license to be an asshole and they are only setting up poor John to fail.", "True but the biggest Ah is op s mother as op is not friends with John and didn't want to invite him to the birthday party and op s Mom overrode this\n\nNTA op but I second inviting John to your mom's birthday party so she gets a taste of her own medicine", "Actually, this is the best idea yet. If she does this then she might learn more about how disabled people still need to have decent enough manners. I hope OP makes this suggestion. Even better, find out where the local group is, and show her. You could encourage her to take John along with her.....", "And what is that kid going through. Not cutting a cake? Only getting on turn per round of bowling? He isn't some terminally ill child. He's a child who needs a better mother and father to raise him. And he acts just like a brat.", "I mean to be fair the kid does sound like a brat as does his mom", "She called op a brat for not wanting to give up his turn to bowl. I doubt she was really mortified till the cake and table thing.", "This one\u2019s hard for me.  The mom is absolutely the crown asshole here.  Still, OP handled this pretty badly.  It\u2019s a question of what standard I can hold a righteously angry 14-year-old to.  I suspect a lot of them would act as immaturely as OP did - they are immature, after all.\n\nI\u2019m tempted to put it down as not ideal but still NTA.", "Heck, I would find op and give him $500 to do it, if I had the money", "And then leave, after setting up a camera.", "Probably some mom's club that they are both apart of and ops mom is lower rank.", "Thank you for the diagnosis, doctor", "Fucking Reddit dishing out the coveted narcissist (mis)diagnosis in record time."]}
