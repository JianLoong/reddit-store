Jerry ask me why I can't just be happy for him and Nate.I  remind him of what happened while he was at bootcamp and Jerry tells me he forgave him for all that. I tell him that Nate treats him like crap and thos is the worst mistake of his life. He just gets mad and says i wouldn't get it.The rest of my family think I should just leave it alone.

Your timing is, um, not great to say the least, but I think 1: it was understandable and 2: it's a good impulse to want to protect your brother.\n\nThat said, you've tried and you've had your answer. Now you have to respect it, be as supportive of your brother as you can, and preserve your relationship with him not least so he can come to you for help if (when?) this all does go wrong", "I'm going to take the downvotes and say NTA.  You're his brother, it's good to try to talk him out of this.", "*\"Congrats bro, I hope it works out the way you want it to.\"* Simple as that. You can put all the shade you want in your voice, too.", "YTA. Wrong time and place. It's your brother's life and his own mistake to make. You could air your concerns privately when alone and ask him if \"he's sure\" but if the answer is yes, then what are you going to do, trash your relationship with your brother over it?", "YTA, not your circus, bro.\n\nMaybe the engagement is a mistake. You're still an AH for pointing that out when, where, and how you did.", "Even though I think you\u2019re probably right, they are 2 grown adults who can make their own choices. All you really can do now is leave it alone\n\nYTA for blurting it out in that moment.", "YTA\n\nWhen you are not being specifically asked, keep your opinion to yourself. Especially, if you want to maintain adult relationships.", "YTA\n\nYou may have valid reasons to dislike Nate, but that wasn't the right moment, nor the proper way to voice your opinion.", "IF you had spoken to him in private about your concerns, I could have approved. You  blurted out, in front of everyone, how stupid you think he is. That's just plain rude, thoughtless, and juvenile. YTA", "NAH, you\u2019re just trying to look out for your brother but he\u2019s clearly over Nate\u2019s cheating so you need to move on too. And the time and place to have this conversation wasn\u2019t at the engagement announcement, it would have been better to pull your brother aside later and have a private conversation with him if you\u2019re that concerned.", "YTA. There's a time, place, and tone for expressing any concerns about their relationship. This wasn't it.", "Sorry OP, but YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for what you said, if it\u2019s entirely true.  He needed to hear it from someone.  You\u2019re the asshole for the tone you used, which is problematic to say the least, and the fact that you blurted this out immediately after he told you of his engagement.\n\nMy advice?  Wait a few days to a week, then reach out and ask to chat.  If he agrees, be humble.  If not, don\u2019t push it.", "What are you really mad about?\n\nDid he lean on you a lot when Nate was cheating?", "I don\u2019t think you are necessarily the ass hole I think you let your emotion get the better of you. At the end of the day is his life, might be a mistake but we all have to make them to grow as people. Nothing you say will change his mind and if you keep pushing it he will  resent you. If you care for him just be there for him, congratulate him. if things do go bad you can help him pick the pieces back up. Is hard to see someone you care about make mistake but sometimes you need to let them and be there to help them get back up.", "Leave it alone.\n\nYou've voiced your objections and everyone knows. No further good comes from nagging people.\n\nNAH... yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At this point, further pushing on your part will just inspire further resistance on his. Play the waiting game.", "This 100%. It is important that you voice your opinion. You are his family and you love him - so thats your right. Your opinion is based on the pain your brother had to tolerate so it is not made with malicious intents of ruining his moment.\n\nBut now leave it be, unless he brings the subject up himself.
