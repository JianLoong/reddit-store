{"id": 28169, "submission_id": "16yzbue", "title": "AITA: for yelling at my sister and mom for not letting my boyfriend can\u2019t come to my sisters wedding.", "selftext": "My sister got engaged last November and she has been extremely excited ever since. I\u2019m 19 M and she offered me a plus one not only that but her fianc\u00e9 made me a groomsman. It means a lot that they would consider me for being in their wedding. In April of this year I met my now boyfriend of 5 months. He has met the family and it went about as well as I would have expected from a deeply religious and homophobic household. I came out my junior year of High school, I am now a sophomore in college so the news of me being gay is nothing new. However, this is my first boyfriend that I\u2019ve had meet my family. \nThe wedding is set for this upcoming June, by the time this rolls around me and my boyfriend will have been together over a year. When I expressed that I wanted him to be my plus one to my mom she said that her and my sister have decided that I don\u2019t get a plus one anymore. I thought ok maybe costs were adding up but then I asked my 15 year old brother and he said he still gets a plus one. I asked my mom why I wasn\u2019t allowed a plus one and she said that she doesn\u2019t want anyone asking any questions about it. I thought this was valid because I have some pretty homophobic grandparents but I\u2019ve come to learn that my grandparents on both sides know about me being gay and that they\u2019ve known for over a year. I brought this up and my mom admitted she doesn\u2019t want her friends to ask questions. So I took this as her feeling ashamed of me and who I love. I haven\u2019t threatened to not go to the wedding or anything but I do feel hurt that my family doesn\u2019t want the man I love to be there with me. I know it\u2019s my sisters big day and I don\u2019t want anything to distract from that so I\u2019ve stayed quiet about how much it hurts. But today I snapped and kinda went off on both of them.

The 15 year old gets a plus one but you, as a groomsman, cannot have your boyfriend of a year come???  A wedding is supposed to be about love but they're just spewing hate. WTF questions are her friends going to ask?  \"Well Sally, when a man really loves another man...\" If I don't have to explain to my 5 year old what gay is (I've raised her to know that people love who they love) then she should not have to explain it to some grown ass individuals.  Maybe they need a crayon pop up book.", "You're NTA, but I'm not sure why you're surprised, since you mention early on in your post that your family is deeply homophobic.", "NTA - Why you should spend time, money, and effort to celebrate your sister's relationship when she doesn't respect or support yours?", "NTA - sometimes people\u2019s road to acceptance isnt easy, but it doesn\u2019t mean they wont get there eventually. I would talk to your sister one on one about this as its her wedding. If they still dont allow you to get a plus one, you have a choice to make.", "NTA\n\nYou are never wrong for telling bigots that they are being bigots.", "NTA. You must be very hurt that people who are supposed to love you are catering to their friends who might be disapproving. You should be vocal about how that makes you feel. I'm sorry they don't value your feelings more than the wedding guests. Hold your head up and decide if you want to go to a wedding where your boyfriend is not welcome. Hugs to you.", "NTA. No plus one because your plus one is a guy? NTA. No way. Its not a coronation, or a coming out party. Its an escort to a function that is offering escorts to others in the wedding party?\n\nYou may not want to make a bad matter worse.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re making a scene at the wedding.\n\nHaving said that, you cannot go to the wedding under these circumstances.  Even if you and your current partner are no longer together, your family\u2019s garbage can\u2019t be tolerated.", "NTA\n\nThe response your mother gave you was just cold, completely unbecoming of a mother to do that. No mother should **ever** be ashamed of their child, no matter what sexuality they happen to be and for her to say \"I don't want my friends asking questions\" really sets in stone that she would feel embarrassed about him being there.\n\nShame on your sister for indulging your mother's childish antics, it doesn't matter how they were raised you are family. They should love you regardless of your sexuality.", "INFO - just to clarify your sister said you would have a  +1 originally and now that you are in the wedding party you don't have a +1 correct?", "Skip the wedding.

I\u2019m also gay and this is just so rude and offensive and like a rejection.\n\nI absolutely understand if you do and you don\u2019t want to escalate things, though. But no, you\u2019re not the asshole for yelling when it was simply standing up for who you are.", "Wow, OP, that sucks. I totally get why you feel the way you do. They've made it clear that you're a second class citizen. I'm surprised you didn't react more than you did.

And I wouldn't be surprised if your sister found out about this situation just when went off on them. Chances are your mother manipulated everyone in this, speaking from experience (In my case, nothing as big as that but manipulation nonetheless).", "NTA Hate to break it to you, your family is homophobic and do not support you.\n\nPersonaly I would not attend I would tell them that way if anyone asks a quesiton they can lie about it but if your asked about girlfriend boyfriend or anything at the wedding you would be honest about them changing your invite because they are ashamed you have a boyfriend and are homophobic. I would outrite tell them that is how th e day will play out if you are there, they have made it clear how they feel.", "YTA\n\n \n\n>from a deeply religious and homophobic household.\n\nWhat did you expect?\n\n>my sisters big day and I don\u2019t want anything to distract\n\nExactly, you know very well if you go with your boyfriend, you'll be the center of the attention.", "You're NTA. But I would recommend not blowing up at them. Unless you think it will legitimately change their view, it just makes you the bad guy in their eyes. I wouldn't give them any ammo.", "NTA, I'm sorry your family is doing that, but idk, man, I'd count your blessings with your family being religious and tolerating you at the very least.
