The kids love to be told and they love talking about. It makes them light up when they hear about their mom but their reaction is super special when people mention how much they look like Zarah.

But in a very soft way.\n\nThe kids spend time with Zarah's family and sometimes James and Sarah are involved, but not often. It bothers Sarah that they are not more enthusiastic about her, it bothers her that they never refer to her as the kids' mom and will ask the kids how \"dad and Sarah\" are or will tell them to get \"dad and Sarah\". She has made attempts over the years to become part of Zarah's family and they have never welcomed that. Sarah really dislikes that and has questioned why they won't embrace her.\n\nShe doesn't like that the kids attend school where Zarah was a teacher, because the kids' teachers knew their mom.\n\nZarah wrote cards and letters for the kids. One for every birthday up until 18 and then all the milestones. She also wrote them cards for when they graduate, get married, have babies, etc. She wrote some letters too for times they struggle.

They told me as much. \n\nSarah is now pregnant and the adoption topic was brought up to the kids again. James told them it would mean if something happened to him, they would stay with Sarah and their new sibling, a sibling they are really excited for. The kids still didn't want it. Then Sarah fought with one of James' friends who told her she needs to stop competing with Zarah.\n\nSarah then came to me and started ranting about how unfair that was and how people should be more understanding of what it's like to be living in Zarah's shadow. I pointed out that the kids love her and couldn't that be enough. She told me that was a weird thing to say and asked if I agreed with James' friend.

Sarah is a selfish, egotistical AH ruled by insecurities and a need to lord over children.  She's so lucky they accepted her in the first place and she takes that for granted by demanding more?  Why did she get into this relationship in the first place?  Very suspect motives.\n\nJames is an AH for marrying and then reproducing with a woman who looks at his children as objects that should be worshipping her.  He's also an AH for trying to push it on the kids.  What magical bits does Sarah have to make him tell to sell out his kid's feelings like that?", "Nta but your sister is.", "NTA, your rationale seems fair. Like what someone else says your sister may benefit from therapy", "This is a complex situation. Sarah is not an AH; anyone who says that should have a bit of compassion. We don\u2019t know what goes on in their marriage today. As for OP, AH depends on three things we as readers have no transparency into: the nature of her relationship with her sister and the intent of the remark and how OP\u2019s point was made (words used, tone and context such as trigger, timing, place, who else was around to hear it).", "NTA. Sarah could probably benefit from therapy. It sounds like she is very lucky to be in the situation shes in, but if she doesnt learn how to manage her jealousy, she could destroy it.", "NTA. I think she needed to hear it and it doesnt sound like you delivered it in a mean way. She is teetering on ruining the good relationship that she has with her stepchildren by pushing too hard and trying to get them to replace their mom. Pretty sure she can still be appointed a guardian in a will so that's not an excuse for the adoption. Being jealous of a deceased person is not healthy behavior. She might benefit from some counseling.", "NTA Sarah is going to end up making those kids resent her because they are going to start feeling smothered by her resentment of their mother. The fact that she tried to say they looked like her; she couldn\u2019t stand them having their favorite connection to their mother is really awful.", "NAH.  First, this story sounds super fake (as are most AITA stories lately) but let's assume for amusement that this story is real.\n\nThe oldest child was only one when the mother died which means they literally have no memories of their mom or of every even calling her mom. \"Sarah\" moved in when the oldest then was 3 years old. \"But they only ever use mom for their mom\", this detail makes no sense, because unless a shrine to \"Zarah\" was built in their home, and family went out of their way to foster a weird and unhealthy pattern of constantly talking about \"Zarah\" as \"Mommy\", the kids would have called Sarah  mom. Kids are resilient and don't dwell on loss like adults do. They would have attached to Sarah as their mother and frankly it would have been healthier for them in the long run to not live in a household so strangely divided.\n\nYou can't blame \"Sarah\" for feeling frustrated as she must always live in the shadow of \"Zarah\" who never grows old or has problems.", "NTA I guess, but tbf I also find this whole thing entirely unfair to Sarah. The kids' bio mom died when they were 1, 1, and 6 weeks old, respectively. Sarah has been the only mother figure they've known for their entire lives (since they were 2, 2, and 1, so before they started developing memories). To live in the shadow of a woman they never met simply because she birthed them seems pretty off. The only things they even know about Zarah are what other people tell them.", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for counseling her with your perception of the situation, harsh as it may be to her, or if she feels that sisters should be more supportive. She asked. \n\nI do think it would hurt anyone to be raising such young children and not at least earning a little respect and inclusion from the rest of the extended family. I don\u2019t know what the line is, but with the new baby on the way there\u2019s going to be obvious differences in the way the kids get treated. Forget the kids themselves, who are too young to understand these complicated dynamics and are not the ones who should have any judgement because they\u2019re children. \n\nShe\u2019s struggling and not an asshole for having negative feelings managing these complicated  relationships with and among four children.", "Why isn\u2019t James addressing this? \n\nThis baby is going to be the bomb in Sarah\u2019s relationships with her stepchildren. She raised them the majority of their lives and wanted to be their mom and now she\u2019s having a baby where she is the mom. The kids decided that she isn\u2019t their mom and that\u2019s their choice but they are going to notice the difference in how she treats her child. \n\nThis all should have been talked about in family therapy and James is a crap father for not insisting on that happening before the baby was conceived.", "It\u2019s very strange that they don\u2019t call Sarah mom and don\u2019t want to considering she\u2019s been there since before they could remember. So something is missing here.", "I really feel for this woman, not gonna lie. She\u2019s been raising these kids since they were 1 and 2 years old, and they still don\u2019t see her as their mom? Kids that young are usually pretty quick to attach to additional parental figures. They shouldn\u2019t lose their attachment to their bio mom, but what is happening behind the scenes to create such a division? Should be the more the merrier as far as moms go. I guess need more INFO would be my judgement.", "NAH\n\nEveryone is being so harsh on Zarah. Nothing in this post suggests that she did less than any other mother figure to raise 3 very young kids through their very trying toddler years. She was there since they met many of their developmental milestones. She put in the work. Of course she is hurt that she put in the work in raising these kids but someone whom the kids don't even have a personal memory of would always have the title of their \"mother\".\n\nNot to say that the kids or the biomom's family are in any way wrong for keeping biomom's memory alive. But it's definitely tough on Sarah and she needs compassion and empathy for how she feels to let these things go and be the best mother figure she can be to these kids.", "This is kind of complicated because she\u2019s been with/raising the kids since they were like 2 or 3. They don\u2019t remember their Mom. The \u201cmemory\u201d of their mom is all on a pedestal and there definitely seems to be some alienation on the other side of the family. That would be a tough situation for anyone to handle.", "YTA. Sarah\u2019s husband should be the one making sure she feels welcomed and part of the family. She\u2019s not competing with Zarah, she\u2019s trying to live a normal life while being told every day that she\u2019s not good enough. She\u2019s raising another woman\u2019s children, who weren\u2019t old enough to possibly remember their mother. They are living with an idealized version of her in their heads, while being cared for every day by this very real woman who loves them, while never really accepting her. She\u2019s the only mother they\u2019ve ever known and has begged to be allowed to fulfill that role, only to be told over and over again that she\u2019s not worthy. She has a right to feel insecure and it\u2019s her husband\u2019s fault for allowing it. \n\nSupport your sister. She shouldn\u2019t be getting even more crap being dumped on her by people who should be there for her. Honestly, I\u2019d have been gone a long time ago. Having to live every day not being good enough must be devastating to her.", "I would say NTA because Sarah seems to gave to fight a battle she can't win.\n\nI mean the kids pretty much only know Sarah as a mother figure. \nSo to mw it seems some people around them actively push for the kids to see the world and Zarah the way they do. As far as the kids can think it was always Sarah around and not Zarah. \n\nI'm for upholding memory and everything but there are some (adult) people around pushing that idea.\nIf I had to guess, then I would bet on Zarahs family that pushes the: remember your real mum!  idea.\n\nMaybe they are unhappy with how fast Sarah came around and let her feel it. \n\nBut thats just wild speculation on my part. Either way, I guess Sarah needs help. This situation can't be healthy for her.", "NTA, but this situation is weird. She\u2019s been in their lives since they were 1 and 2 years old, she is mom. She\u2019s not competing with a memory, at this point she\u2019s competing with a fictionalized account of someone they never knew. I feel bad for everyone involved. I can see why your sister is pissed.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s probably too late. You were right to tell her to back off. There\u2019s been some parental alienation going on since the beginning from somewhere and that isn\u2019t just going to go away. Just accept that they don\u2019t see themselves as hers and move on accordingly.", "I am the current partner of a widower. there are no kids involved, but it takes a certain amount of thick skin to be able to cope with jealousies in this situation. People don't speak ill of the dead, so partners of widows/widowers typically only hear the very best things about the people they lost and it can definitely feel like you have to fill their shoes or live up to them. It's not easy.\n\nBut Sarah is taking it to a bad place where she is trying to push herself into the role of Zarah (INFO: are the names really that similar??) instead of accepting her organic place in her family. She will push everyone away. Her bitterness will ruin everything. She cannot erase Zarah. She needs to accept that Zarah is a permanent fixture in her life and home and the lives of the children.\n\nYou are NTA. She needs to hear this.", "NTA Though, I find it strange that she has been raising them since they were toddlers and is the only mom they have ever known and they don't call her 'mom'. Especially, with the youngest having no active memories of her. Did someone actively when they were small correct them on that? I understand not wanting the memory of their birth mom to die and them to know who their mother was but it might hurt them with this making it where they feel bad about calling Sarah 'mom' for it upsets someone else or were told it would betray their mom if it did. Maybe talk to the kids and see if this is the case.  \n\n\nYou need to be supportive of your sister but remind her she can't push so hard because it just going to make them buck and she doesn't want to sour things with them. Remind her as a mom she knows she can't just force kids to do anything for it never ends well. Zarah might have been an awesome person but so is Sarah and it's there is no competition to see who loves the kids more or anything like that.  \n\n\nDoes sound like the whole family needs therapy and is a bit sad they won't get the real help they need.", "Not being able to adopt children for whom you are expected to be responsible is like taxation without representation. This is a serious legal issue that should be addressed by the adults in the situation, not the children.", "NTA, but this is a minefield in terms of emotionally charged conversations. Maaaan. I feel for her. I do. It must be hard doing all of the work of a \"mom\" without the perks. Zarah will always loom large in their lives - as she should. It is going to take many, many years of consistently showing up to earn a place of prominence in their lives. If she continues to resent the memory of their mother, it isn't going to happen at all. I never took my stepfather's name and refused to be adopted - because I HAD a dad already. I love my stepfather and admire him a great deal, I'm grateful for all the ways he has showed up in my life - but he isn't dad - he's Alan. I would grieve bitterly if he died and I love him, but he's not my father. That should be ok. As a child, loyalty towards my biological father prevented me from accepting the offer and I resented my mother for pushing me to \"choose.\"\n\nHopefully, when Sarah has this biological child, it will provide her with some much needed clarity and her views will soften. She can ask herself if she would like to be erased from her child's life if she had to face the devastation of leaving that child when she didn't want to. Zarah will *always* be there. Always. Sarah needs to accept this and embrace the role she plays in their lives or she will never be happy and the kids will indeed chooseif they are forced to  - they'll choose their mother, every time.", "NTA and while she has a great relationship with the kids now, the harder she pushes on this issue and the older the kids get, the worse their relationship will get. She should be in therapy for *her* feelings and the best way to navigate thru them without ruining this relationship. I do see your comment that she won\u2019t go though. That\u2019s her choice. And when she does ruin the relationship she has with her stepchildren, she\u2019ll have no one to blame but herself unfortunately.

And if she doesn't like that the kids call her Sarah, they can all come up with a different name for her.

Why she isn't grateful that they love her is beyond me, since a lot of stepmothers never get that. Why would she think Zarahs parents should be grateful for her, they lost their daughter you ass and you are a constant reminder of that. She needs to grow up and learn to accept what it is.

They've been very patient with her, but that patience isn't unlimited, especially as they approach puberty.\n\nYou did the right thing by telling her the truth.

NTA", "it's high time people stop treating Sarah with kid gloves. you need to address this. if she doesn't stop she will permanently ruin her relationship with those kids. you are correct. the kids love her and that should be enough. plenty of step parents would kill to have what your sister has, and she needs to be made aware of that. Sarah is on a path of self destruction if she doesn't get over this insecurity regarding her steps late mother. it's pathetic that she's so determined to compete with a dead woman. NTA", "NTA.   You didn\u2019t just come out with it.   She asked, you answered.    And you are right, she needs to realise that the kids rejection of her being a new mom isn\u2019t personal, or something to be offended by.  Nobody can replace their mom, it isn\u2019t about her.", "NTA but I think it actually needs to be a blunt conversation, along the lines they clearly do love you, but they want to and have every right to talk about their mum. James in-laws probably aren't welcoming because they know she's trying to erase their daughter. If she wants to continue having a relationship with the kids she needs to back off because if she keeps pushing, she'll turn the love they do have for her into resentment.\n\nHow would she like it if something were to happen to her and another woman came along trying to erase her child's memory of her.", "NTA. Your sister has no business trying to replace Zarah. She is holding onto a fantasy that she is NOT entitled to - she cannot compete with the real-mom-on-a-pedestal - and these kids are entitled to love and honor their bio Mom.

I feel for everyone involved. The reality is that navigating these kinds of emotions are hard.", "NTA, but it sounds like everyone needs to have an open and honest conversation to work through these complex emotions", "NTA.\n\nI mean, the question is how much you want to get involved in that whole thing. Because the situation is complicated and while being wrong, i can understamd why some ugly emotions raise their heads in your sisters brain. \n\nMaybe some kind of coubselling can help? I guess it is complicated enough being a step-mother, but being a step-mother to half-orphans can be very complicated.\nShe should accept that she is not their mommy, however. She is something different. But maybe you can try to get in her head, that this does not mean she is something less or worse, just another category to the kids (like a grandparent and an uncle are different, too, but also have relationships to the kids)?", "NTA I would have told her as much as well. She isn't meant to replace their mom and they don't want her replaced. They love your sister but Zarah is their mom first and formost. If she can't handle that then she either needs to get out of the relationship or get over it.", "OP, what is your relationship like with the kids? If they\u2019re coming to you saying this stuff about Sarah, I assume they\u2019re close to you and your\u2019s/Sarah\u2019s family right?", "NTA, she does compete. It isn't healthy. She would be much happier to just embrace that she is Sarah the beloved step mom, soon mom of an own little munchkin.", "NTA\n\nSarah has dining escalated things over the last 7 years. She should have gone the opposite direction but she didn\u2019t learn any healthy skills to manage these feelings. That\u2019s on her. \n\nJames is also failing here. He needed to reel her in. And yeah I\u2019m side-eyeing their timeline though I get it\u2019s not terrible.", "NTA\n\n\nI still refer to my step mom as Mrs Name (we knew her for a time before they started dating, my step sister and I started it as friends), as well as momma. She never pushed me to call her mom, she understood the complex and complicated feelings my brothers and I have around it all. We love her so much. And now that I have my own kids, I explain it to my toddler that I was lucky enough to have two mommies who loved me, just not at the same time.\n\nMy younger brother called her Mrs Name as we grew up. But they just had a mother-son dance at his wedding, and they both cried. \n\nWhen we were younger she would help us do a craft to take to my mom's grave. She would drive us there even without my dad coming along. She never begrudged photos or stories, or visiting my mom's family. And that's part of what helped me love her so much. She is mommom to my kids. She is my momma. \n\nI see this all to illustrate that I was this kid, I understand the situation that Sarah is in even if I haven't been in it from her perspective. And she will absolutely either drive these kids away young by doing this, or will create resentment that will emerge when they are older and realize what happened. \n\nIf she can realize and deal with her upset and feelings of competition with their other mom, those kids will love her all the more for it. She's so lucky they love her and want her to be one of their moms. Don't let her throw that away, or cause mental health issues for the kids", "She needs to quit while she's ahead. The kids accept her as a mother figure, they're excited for the baby, that's a lot more than some of the posts on here regarding step families. If she keeps pushing she will loose the kids , they won't want any kind of relationship with  \" Dads wife who hates our mum\" \nOp is NTA", "NTA honestly, I very much blame the father in this. The kids were so young when their mothers passed, they need more time to properly grieve and depend on him as a parent. Instead, he got married and moved on extremely fast. Though the kids took it well and love Sarah, but the more she just hates their mom so visibly, that love will only turn into resentment one day, and she will have no one to blame herself.\n\nSarah needs to stop pushing and just be there for the kids when they want her to be. Bottom line is she will always be second best, I know that\u2019s harsh, but she cannot replaced their mom. And it\u2019s despicable that she wants to. You\u2019re not in the wrong because you told her exactly what she needed to hear. Clearly, her husband isn\u2019t so someone has to.", "Truthfully, this often comes up when widows/widowers remarry and the new partner tries to take over the deceased person's role. I contribute this issue to the fact that we are not taught to grieve in healthy ways. People assume that three days in the dirt means the past is in the past, all feelings buried. But Zarah (weirdly close to Sarah, btw) can't be replaced in the hearts of her children and her husband. How wonderful that Zarah had enough time to prepare notes for her children and how sad and tragic that Sarah hates those letters. It's completely understandable that the kids don't want to be adopted and quite frankly given the way Sarah's behaving I can see Zarah's parents wanting to step into the role of caregiver should something happen to their father. Sarah assumes that she's entitled to everyone's love at the expense of Zarah versus recognizing that she's in the perfect situation to enhance everyone's life, to take the gifts that Zarah provided and carry them into the future, and to help the children create new memories while being enshrouded in their mother's love for them. So many children become emotionally stunted when a beloved parent dies. These kids are truly lucky they have such a community around them that keeps their mother present. Sarah is being selfish. \n\nI lost a partner to death fifteen years ago and found a new partner about four years ago. My new partner has never expected or put pressure on me to choose who I love more. He understands and cherishes the love that I had before I met him as that paved the way for him. I cannot be separated from my past love any more than Sarah's husband and stepchildren. Sarah has the children's love. I wish she loved the children enough to confront her insecurity and to put their needs ahead of her own.  \n\nYou're NTA. Your sister is on the verge of ruining a good thing, especially since in many situations like this the kids aren't so gentle with drawing their boundaries. Why can't their love be enough?", "NTA. Your sister probably needs counseling before this escalates and harms the relationship she does have with the kids. \n\nThere was a story on Reddit awhile back of a similar situation where the OP was the stepmom and she was super jealous of her husband's late wife and especially over the way the kids didn't view her as a mom and held on to the picture, items, and letter from their mom. She didn't tell anyone or get help, she just kept spiraling about it. \n\nOne day the husband and kids were out and she took all the items, pictures and letters and destroyed them. It came out what she did and everyone hated her. Her husband filed for divorce, the kids hated her, her own friends and family called her a monster. \n\nThere are also tons of stories from stepkids on here explaining how they had a step parent that pushed and pushed the adoption thing and it ended up making them hate the step parent and even their bioparent that pushed the idea too. \n\nYour sister and her husband need therapy and to read these stories as a warning of what will happen if they don't get a grip.

Sounds like your sister thinks that being supportive is just agreeing with her. And that's not the case you can tell her that you love her and you have her back but still let her know when she's wrong. I'm afraid she's going to eventually push the kids away as they get older. The kids love her and she has a good relationship with them she needs to let this be enough. How many posts have we seen on Reddit about teens who now are not getting along with their step parent because they pushed and pushed for adoption or just to be more than what the kids were able to give at the time. She's in a good place with the kids now someone needs to tell her to stop pushing before she starts pushing them away and to be happy and thankful she had a good relationship with them now and in time perhaps it will grow to something more on its own.  I think you're being a good sister.", "NTA - and you're probably the right person to try to get through to her.\n\nMarrying a widow(er), especially one with kids, isn't for everyone.  You have to be able to accept that you wouldn't have them if their spouse hadn't died.  You might even have to accept that you're not the love of their life.\n\nThis gets even more complicated when there are kids involved.  The deceased spouses' family are always going to be in the picture.  Like it or not, they're going to be permanent reminders that Sarah isn't their Mom.  They can't be erased just so that the kids can be nudged towards Sarah.  Also, she has to respect that their Mom wrote the letters in part so that they won't forget that she would have been with them if she could have.\n\nThe kids were at the ages where things could have gone both ways.

Maybe if she stopped trying to erase Zarah\u2019s existence, then Zarah\u2019s family might be more accepting of her.

Don't even try & I'm not sure why your sister has caught on to that.  She is just creating distance between her and the kids by acting this way about their mom.

Eventually, they love a spouse and their own children. Sarah needs to learn that when her children love and are loved by others that's a beautiful thing. They have room in their hearts for many.

The kids were old enough to see that they had a mom and Sarah is trying to be their mom instead of an addition to their life as their dad\u2019s wife.", "Considering how fast Sarah moved with their dad after their mother's death, she should be grateful that her relationship with the kids is at least positive. But WTF trying to get people to say her husband's kids look a little bit like her? To hate the letters their dying Mom left for them, which is as much as saying she hates that the step-kids get comfort? She's got massive insecurities.\n\nNTA, but she is.", "NTA. Tell her that competing with a dead woman is not a good look. She is NOT their biological mother. Instead of embracing her role as someone who can carry on Zarah\u2019s legacy, she\u2019s trying to be better than her. Again, a woman who is dead. She needs to get her emotions in order. What is she afraid of? The kids just aren\u2019t going to see her as their mother and that\u2019s that.", "NTA. she is going to drive a massive wedge between her & the kids if she doesn't sort her jealousy out!!", "Nta and honestly you\u2019d be doing your sister a disservice if you don\u2019t put in terms she can understand. \u201cYou\u2019re about to have a child, how would you feel if x remarries after and she tries to make your child forget you existed, and to try to take over as mom\u201d", "NTA.  Sarah needs therapy.  She\u2019s ruining the good relationship she has with these kids.  If her mom died and dad remarried, would she call the new woman \u201cmom\u201d?  Would she cut off her mom\u2019s family and replace it with her new stepmom\u2019s family?   Or another point of view - she\u2019s pregnant.  Would she want her biological child to call another woman mom?  No.  \n\nIn the end, she CHOSE to marry a widower with kids.  She knew what she was signing up for.  SHE joined a FAMILY.  \n\nSigned, Child of a Dead Dad", "NTA if she keeps this up the kids will hate her. My stepmom and dad tried that with me and that\u2019s why neither of them were at my wedding", "NTA. Sister is TA for wanting and expecting these young kids to forget their mommy. That is horrible for her to even suggest. They are not comfortable calling her mom and understandably love to hear from her from the grave. What their mom did for them was incredibly thoughtful. I wish my mom would have done the same for me and I was 32 when my mom died! Your sister needs to get over it and be grateful those sweet kids love her and accept her. She sounds childish and super insecure for no reason. But also spiteful that she \"hates those letters!\"", "NTA\n\nSarah is NOT their mom and if she feels like she is in Zarah\u2019s shadow, she needs to do some inner work. And it\u2019s unhinged to say the kids look like her, too. What the hell? \n\nAnd Sarah needs to accept that Zarah\u2019s family may not always or ever be enthusiastic about her. Their is no time limit on anyone\u2019s grief. For all we know, time stood still for Zarah\u2019s family. Yeah, it\u2019s been some years, but it really sounds like Zarah was a fantastic woman and her loss is likely still greatly affecting her family. Sarah can\u2019t place expectations on them. \n\nSarah knew the situation she walked into and married into. This isn\u2019t a typical situation, and Zarah\u2019s loss is obviously widely felt. \n\nIt is enough that the kids love her, to expect more is ridiculous. Sarah sounds jealous of a dead woman.", "NTA. \n\nBy the end of the story, I forgot that you were related to Step-Mom, because your perspective so clearly aligns with that of Bio-Mom's ghost. \n\nGood on you for telling your sister to get over herself. Somebody needs to say it.", "NTA. I see this kind of letter over and over here and it\u2019s just so wrong. I\u2019ll never understand why people like this become obsessed with erasing previous family members and attempting to take their place like this. Why can\u2019t she simply respect that they loved their mother and be a cool, new person who loves them in their life? She\u2019s doing the one thing that will end up making them hate her. She needs to stop. She\u2019s being selfish and cruel and completely unrealistic. Someone -preferably James - needs to tell her to knock it off already.", "Did Zarah know she was going to die? Is that why she wrote so many letters in advance of various milestones?", "Agreed.  You can be \u201csupportive\u201d and \u201cunderstanding\u201d and still point out where things are going off the rails.  I would even say that you\u2019re not really supporting someone if you\u2019re just blindly agreeing to everything they are saying. \n\nDoes your sister want a rubber stamp for her feelings or to find a constructive way of addressing the issues?  Sounds like she wants the former, which not will not accomplish the latter or otherwise end well for her.  \n\nNTA.", "Yeah, I do have sympathy for Sarah. I'm sure, logically, it can feel like you're being cheated out of a relationship that you've earned by being there for the kids, which it sounds like she has been. But you can't blame the kids for missing their mom and wanting a connection with her. Being the stepparent to kids who have lost a parent is not a role everyone can take on. But she needs to embrace the fact that the kids love her in her own special way and she doesn't have to be \"mom\" to hold an important place in their lives. The more she pushes this, the more likely she is to drive a wedge between herself and the kids.", "im worried Sarah will try to destroy any evidence of Zarah, including the letters Zarah wrote, photos, mementos, things Zarah bought or made, etc.", "Exactly! She's clearly on the way to sabotaging her life trying to replace someone who's already gone.", "Sarah is being an asshole.    \n\nThose kids go in to school everyday, eager to hear stories about the mom they never knew from her friends and coworkers. And Sarah has a problem with that. She\u2019s competing with a dead person.", "Lucky to be told every day that she\u2019s not as good as a mythical woman? You realize these children never knew their mother? But, every day, by her husband, his children, and the woman\u2019s family, she\u2019s told she\u2019s not worthy? How is that lucky? Her husband is the AH here and has allowed this to continue to an unacceptable point.", "She gets all the burdens and responsibilities of motherhood with none of the love and appreciation. I wouldn\u2019t characterize that as \u201clucky\u201d. It\u2019s a difficult situation, and she needs therapy like, yesterday.", "There was an AITA thread on here a few week ago, about an adult who was the stepchild to one of these people.\n\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising that the step-mom trying to force this connection is what ultimately ruined any other relationship the two may have had.", "Agree. The bios mom's parents are going to refer to their daughter as the kids mom... because she was. And they are going to talk about her because she was their kid. As long as they are civil and don't trash talk Sarah to the kids they don't need to invite Sarah into their family. \n\nShe needs to deal with her insecurities or she will end up bitter and unhappy and the kids will resent her.", "Also why would they refer to her as mom when the kids don't even?\n\nIt's common that you refer to people as kids refer to people. If your kids call their grandma nana then when referring to them you will usually call them nana. Like: \"Are you excited to see Nana this weekend?\"\n\nWhen my sister and I were very small we had 2 grandpa's. One we called 'Grandpa with the beard' because... well he had a beard. When other people talked about him they would call him 'Grandpa with the beard'. My grandparents on both sides also had partners who were unrelated to us. And while they were as much grandparents to us as the biological ones (we'd never known differently) we just referred to them by name. And the rest of the family followed suit.\n\nA name/tittle doesn't determine how much you love someone. I loved all my grandparents equally and in their own special way. I didn't even realise as a kid that the grandparents I referred to by name were biologically not my family.\n\nI'm sure the kids love their Stepmom a lot. Regardless of what they call her. And I'm sure Zara's family is relieved that they are being raised by someone who they love and who loves them. But it is not up to them to determine what the kids should or should not be calling her.\n\nWhich they would be doing if they suddenly started referring to her as their mom when the kids themselves don't do it.", "I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen a few comments saying this because it was all I could think while reading the post. Sure, when I read stories about a stepparent trying to force a relationship on a kid who is already like 15 it\u2019s dumb, but Sarah raised these kids with James. She\u2019s the only mother figure they\u2019ve ever known and she doesn\u2019t seem to get much credit for it.", "He's on my sister's side with trying to get the kids to agree to the adoption. I don't know if he knows about all her feelings. But I do know he has called my sister the kids' mom before.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole, but I can speak from experience that it\u2019s usually best to listen and not speak when a loved one has a complicated situation that would be very hard to relate to.", "He's addressing it in the sense that he is with my sister on trying to get the kids to agree to being adopted. But that's about all he's addressing. I don't think he has a problem with the rest/maybe doesn't know.\n\nBut he's also someone in desperate need of therapy because he is burying his grief and love for his first wife.", "> The kids decided that she isn\u2019t their mom and that\u2019s their choice\n\nI'm not entirely convinced it really is their choice. They never even knew their birth mother and for all intents and purposes Sarah is the only mother figure they have ever known. It feels to me like the adults in Zarah's family have had some hand in this.", ">Of course she is hurt that she put in the work in raising these kids but someone whom the kids don't even have a personal memory of would always have the title of their \"mother\".\n\nNo, not of course. It's not like Zarah intentionally abandoned the kids and never wanted to do her duty of raising them, leaving Sarah to pick up the slack. Zarah *died.* She physically couldn't raise her kids, not bc she didn't want to, but bc she was forced to. Sarah knew that going in, and if she couldn't accept that the kids were still going to love their biological mom who clearly loved them and that they could tell *would* have wanted to raise them with love and care, then Sarah shouldn't have married a widower with kids. \n\nIf Sarah raised the kids with the intention of a reward-like being called mom-then she went in with the wrong intentions. It's one thing to want the kids to love her and treat her with respect and hope for a good relationship: that stuff is perfectly reasonable for a stepmom to want when the kids are that young. But she has that, and she's not satisfied. She wants more. But she isn't owed more. The kids lost their mom, and though they don't have strong memories of her, they still have a strong attachment to her, which is completely understandable. They have every right to only want one mom.", "I don't think any alienation is going on. But the kids have a lot of people in their lives who loved their mom. From family, to family friends, to teachers who all worked with her. And they love hearing about her from those people.", "> Your sister, like many step parents, tried to swoop in and erase and replace the biological parent. And she learned why that never works. Parents aren't interchangeable. You get one mom for your entire life and if you are unlucky a second female caregiver because your own mother died or your family broke down.\n\nI mean tbf their bio mom died when they were 1 year, 1 year, and 6 weeks old, respectively. For all intents and purposes Sarah is the only mother figure they've ever known. I completely understand why she's put off by living in Zarah's shadow.", "Exactly this.", "A mother\u2019s love isn\u2019t a zero sum game. MOST people only get to have one mom, but there are non-standard families with multiple. \n\nI\u2019m adopted. My adoptive mom and my biological mom are both my moms. I call them both that, and the \u201conly ONE mom\u201d police haven\u2019t kicked down my door yet. I don\u2019t have to take love away from one to recognize the other. And I cannot even fathom disrespecting the woman who raised me since before I can remember enough to call her by her first name.\n\nAnd sure, different families are different, different people respond to their family situation in different ways. But this \u201cyou only get one mom\u201d thing is a load of zero-sum crap.", "That has never been mentioned by the kids. But from day one they have been told stories of their mom, shown her photos, had her mentioned in casual conversation and almost everyone in their lives knew and loved their mom.\n\nIt's also the fact they get to read her words every year. The twins have read a couple of her letters too. I truly think Zarah has just always been someone they were aware of and they knew she was/is mom so Sarah was stepmom.", "One caveat - if she has to swallow these feelings in front of her husband and the kids, you should be available as a safe harbor for her to vent this pain. Because I'm sure it is painful.", "I don't think my sister would agree to therapy.", "I agree. We talked about this on and off before, but in less serious ways than the last conversation. I have tried to help her to help herself. She is clearly not coping with the reality of the family she has. But there's not really anything I can do for her under the circumstances.

You're trying to help, and it's way past the point where she should be getting this.\n\nI understand this from both sides.   First, I was in a four year relationship with a widower, and it's kind of hard to navigate if you don't have your act together.  In that respect, I did have some insecurities.  My ex would gush and gush and talk and talk about how wonderful his late wife was, which made me feel even more insecure.  I'd think to myself, \"Let's face it - if she hadn't died, you wouldn't even be a thought to him.\"  Which is crazy, being jealous of a person who's passed away.  But I admit, that's where my mind would go sometimes.  No one is asking the family to not remember Zarah fondly and with love.  It's just something your sister has to come to terms with.  Has she seen a therapist for these feelings?\n\nThe other part I do understand is the kids' side.  OP's sister is trying too hard, and in this case, I understand the kids.  My parents divorced, and when I was about middle school age. my dad was dating this woman who was nice enough, and who we would probably have grown to like eventually.  But SHE TRIED SO HARD to get us to like her.  She'd knock herself out to try and force herself on us to be best buddies.  And all it did was push us away.  She finally backed off after a few years, and guess what happened?  I started to like her once she gave me some breathing room.\n\nSo, no, OP is NTA.  I hope your sister can figure out some sort of realization that she's not going to have much of a chance with these kids if she doesn't back off, and more importantly, figure out how to stop being jealous of a dead woman.

The fact that they have affection for her as stepmom needs to be enough. She is a bonus mom, but cannot be the biomom. Of course, those kids are not going to look like her.  She didn't birth them. Of course, the kids want to hang out with both sides of their family.  Sarah must back off before they begin to hate and resent her, and then may turn on their half-sibling.", "NTA, but an observation.  Sarah is pregnant.

Would she want her baby to have family and friends who could and would ensure that her baby grew up knowing about her, hearing stories about her, hearing they resemble her and being happy to hear it? Or would she want them to know nothing about her and call some other woman \"mom\", because anything else would upset their new/replacement mom?", "Sarah really has it good. Her stepchildren love her. That's not always the case. If she keeps this up, she could alienate them. She just needs to chill out. I hope she does. Who has the letters or notes from Zarah? The grandparents? I hope they're in a safe place. There have been some horror stories of stepmom destroying such letters (or photos, etc.)", "Sarah got their first days at school, first time riding their bikes, first celebrating Christmas and birthdays when the kids actually knew what they were. She will get first boyfriends/girlfriends, first graduations, first weddings, first babies. Is that not enough? Zarah gets one, maybe two, letters a year that she knew she would never see her babies read. Does Sarah need to take everything from the poor woman?", "Not considering therapy is bad.  She's just going to get more entrenched in these feelings.  She's obviously not able to navigate these feelings on her own, she needs some help.", "\"Easy\" solution: if you talk to the hubby, mention to him that the children are afraid to mention their mother around Sarah, and how Sarah feels, and suggest therapy. (Obviously this only works if you are friends with the husband, otherwise it'd be seen as being a busybody/overstepping.)\n\nHubby deffo should push her to do it, and he himself could, because he is the father of said kiddos, and the other partner in this marriage.", "Their step mother is Sarah. The dead woman, their birth mother, is Zarah", "I have twin nieces, and twins don't even run in our family.  They're not uncommon at all!", "Via an accident of fate, Zarah was only able to birth them and did not get to know or raise her children. Sarah has been their mother since they were six weeks and one years old.", "This is exactly where my mind went. It's entirely possible she may have been sick all through her pregnancy, and once the youngest was born, her body wasn't able to fight off the illness, whether it was cancer or something else terminal.  If she knew her time was limited through the whole pregnancy, she may have had nine months to write those letters to her kids instead of six weeks.", "I didn't catch OP'S comment about Zarah passing away from a terminal illness. Sorry about that.", "Their dad can do that on his own. Imagine having already had your mom die right after childbirth and now your dad is saying he might die after his new baby is born. Those poor, poor kids must be frantic. I hope they can get some therapy (and your sister too). NTA", "That kind of behavior where the kids feel the need to walk on the adult\u2019s emotional eggshells is definitely not healthy and can definitely lead to anxiety issues, huge red flag. I get that this is a hard situation for Sarah too, but she\u2019s the adult in this situation and needs to act like it.", "That's just horrible to think about.  I hope he has the letters hidden in a safe space.", "You mean like their dad probably referring to her as \"Sarah\" up until they married, when the kids were 3 and 4 years old?", ">it bothers her that they never refer to her as the kids' mom and will ask the kids how \"dad and Sarah\" are or will tell them to get \"dad and Sarah\".\n\nThe kids' mom was their own daughter. Why should they refer to Sara as mom, when their daughter gave birth to their grandchildren and these kids embody what remains of her in this world for them.  They aren't disrespecting Sara by referring to her by her name. She is Sara, and she is a Stepmom whether she likes it or not, regardless of how early she stepped into the role. There's nothing wrong with that. \n The same way you say that you don't have to give birth to be a mom, .... You don't have to be called \"mom\" to be a good maternal figure. \n \nMaybe Sara being pushy is what makes the grandparents not be enthusiastic about her.  It's a shame because the kids love her and she treats them great, but this little obsession of her with titles is gonna play against her.", "Are you Sarah?    \nStop forcing those poor kids to call you mom. They will when they are ready, or they may never. You have to make your peace with it. I know you\u2019re probably raising them well, but let it go", "That's exactly what I've been thinking after reading OP's post, I'm sad it took so much scrolling to read this.", "Life isn't a fairy tale and you're projecting some serious accusations into someone who didn't show any ill will up to this point, only some insecurities and lack of maturity. Cut it out with the fanfic.", "I'm really not sure what you're getting at. Did you respond to the right comment?", ">The kids' mom was their own daughter. Why should they refer to Sara as mom, when their daughter gave birth to their grandchildren and these kids embody what remains of her in this world for them.  They aren't disrespecting Sara by referring to her by her name.\n\nOn that part I totally agree with you, calling her by her name isn't in and of itself disrespectful at all. It's a bit odd so many years later, since the kids have never known another mother, but it's not disrespectful by itself. Coupled with the way they act, it might be seen like that. Yeah, you definitely don't need to be called mom to be a mother, either. \n\nI do think Sarah needs some serious therapy and needs to get away from the idea that she needs to be called mom. But I can understand why she might have some of the feelings she does too. When you're constantly being compared to someone else, even unintentionally, it can probably be a bit stressful (and yes, some of that stress is likely self-inflicted). They all really need to be on the same page, not for Sarah or the husband, or even themselves, but for the kids.", "Lol wut? This would be applicable if the kids are 15 or just lost their mother and were cognizant of that loss, but Sarah has been raising the kids for almost ten years, since they were in diapers.", "Did she undergo treatment?", "That comment also assumes a lot based on about eight paragraphs of text. I\u2019m not even necessarily saying it\u2019s wrong, just that we don\u2019t have nearly enough information to conclude that.", ">They all really need to be on the same page, not for Sarah or the husband, or even themselves, but for the kids.\n\nThe page the kids want, has already been made clear. They love Sara, I'm sure they appreciate her and everything she did for them, but they also know they had a mom before who is no longer here but loved them so much that even left letters for them. There's photos and people telling them about her as well.  Sara won't be mom. She can fill that role, she can continue raise them and love them like she has been doing all these years.....but she isn't Mom. And Sara is the only one not getting it. If after so many years she doesn't accept it and refuses therapy (like I think I read in one of Op's comments) then she shouldn't have married a widowed dad I guess.", "I'd say it says way more about the person behind the comment than about the situation in hand", ">She can fill that role, she can continue raise them and love them like she has been doing all these years.....but she isn't Mom.\n\nI completely disagree with this. If she has been doing the role of mom, she IS their mother, just not biologically. Sadly their biological mom died, and _couldn't_ act as their mother for long. \n\nI feel so sorry for this lady who by all logic and facts is the mother of these children, and nobody around her recognizes that. One day, she'll get fed up of putting in love and effort for 0 reciprocity, and she'll actually become \"just\" their father's wife. She'll focus on her newborn, someone who she won't have to beg to be recognized for what she is, and that's when they'll call her all sort of evil things."]}
