James has three children with his late wife, Zarah. The kids are 9 year old boy/girl twins and an almost 8 year old boy. Their mom died 6 weeks after the youngest was born. Sarah and James met a year later, moved in together a year after that and married 5 years ago.\n\nSarah gets along really well with her stepkids and they love her. But Sarah is very insecure when it comes to her place in their lives. She wanted to adopt the kids but they didn't want it. None of the kids call Sarah mom. They do love her though and that is very clear. There is no \"you're not my mom you can't tell me what to do\" going on. But they only ever use mom for their mom.\n\nThe kids look very like Zarah. The kids love to be told and they love talking about. It makes them light up when they hear about their mom but their reaction is super special when people mention how much they look like Zarah. Sarah hates it. She has tried to suggest the kids look sort of like her and the kids think she's silly when she does that and they have told her that before. But in a very soft way.\n\nThe kids spend time with Zarah's family and sometimes James and Sarah are involved, but not often. It bothers Sarah that they are not more enthusiastic about her, it bothers her that they never refer to her as the kids' mom and will ask the kids how \"dad and Sarah\" are or will tell them to get \"dad and Sarah\". She has made attempts over the years to become part of Zarah's family and they have never welcomed that. Sarah really dislikes that and has questioned why they won't embrace her.\n\nShe doesn't like that the kids attend school where Zarah was a teacher, because the kids' teachers knew their mom.\n\nZarah wrote cards and letters for the kids. One for every birthday up until 18 and then all the milestones. She also wrote them cards for when they graduate, get married, have babies, etc. She wrote some letters too for times they struggle. The kids love reading them to people when they get a new one. Sarah hates those letters.\n\nThe kids have picked up on Sarah hating their mom being mentioned. They told me as much. \n\nSarah is now pregnant and the adoption topic was brought up to the kids again. James told them it would mean if something happened to him, they would stay with Sarah and their new sibling, a sibling they are really excited for. The kids still didn't want it. Then Sarah fought with one of James' friends who told her she needs to stop competing with Zarah.\n\nSarah then came to me and started ranting about how unfair that was and how people should be more understanding of what it's like to be living in Zarah's shadow. I pointed out that the kids love her and couldn't that be enough. She told me that was a weird thing to say and asked if I agreed with James' friend. I told her it does feel like she competes with Zarah and that it's not healthy. My sister lost it and told me I'm meant to be more supportive than that, and more understanding.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700568458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180fhjv/aita_for_telling_my_sister_it_does_feel_like_shes/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Reason I feel like I might be the ass for saying this to her is I can see partly why she feels like she's living in her shadow and why she gets so insecure about this. I don't think she handles any of this the best. But by agreeing with her husband's friend I feel like I might have made her feel even worse, which will only make things worse in their home.

And she learned why that never works. Parents aren't interchangeable. You get one mom for your entire life and if you are unlucky a second female caregiver because your own mother died or your family broke down. \n\nThose kids deserve their ONE mother even after death. She is thier only mother even after death. They deserve connection to her in any way they can find it...thru letters...thru family...thru traditions. \n\nYour sister needs to stop being so selfish. She's about to have her own child now and become a real mother....how would she feel if after death some new woman was trying to erase all trace of HER from her own child's life just because an ADULT can't control their emotions around something that literally has nothing to do with them.", "nta. it's understandable that sarah feels insecure, but it's not healthy to compete with a deceased spouse. the kids clearly love her, and she should focus on building a positive relationship with them instead of trying to replace their late mom.", "NTA. If your sister doesn't change her view on this, she's about to nuke her relationship. I don't understand why she insists on their grandparents referring to her as the kids' mom...when the kids'  biomom was actually their deceased daughter FFS. \n\nShe is bonkers just for that.", "NTA.\n\nJames needs to nip this shit before the baby arrives. Your sister is going to completely wreck any chance of her child having a good relationship with her stepchildren if she keeps this up. Where *has* he been in all this?", "NTA. \n\nIt's been 7 years, at this point Sarah should have figured a healthy path forward but I think it's likely something that has grown. \n\nI would have a non-judgemental conversation with Sarah about this as she says she feels like she's in Zarah's shadow. She obviously knows and feels that those kids would trade her for their biological mom and that can be a hard feeling when you also feel like those children are your's. She's really the only mom they've ever known and to feel like you're never going to get that place can be hard. \n\nHer step-kids feelings on Sarah are not something to be negotiated, so Sarah needs to come to terms with this well before the new baby comes.", "NTA. She's in an almost perfect situation as a Step-parent and she's going to destroy it because she's jealous of a dead woman. If she left everyone alone, things would eventually turn out the way she wants them to, but she's too self-absorbed to let that happen.", "NTA. Sarah is going to ruin her relationship with those kids if she doesn\u2019t relax and accept that their mother is always going to be a huge part of their lives.", "NTA\n\nWith her attitude and issues towards his kids, James should have kicked her out years back. But I guess she's cheaper than childcare and hookers.", "nta. Sarah needs to prioritize her relationship with the kids and seek therapy to work through her insecurities. It's not healthy to compete with the memory of a deceased loved one.", "You are NTA. Your sister needs counseling, preferably to start before she delivers. Your behavior may impair her future relationships with the kids. Also may make her show differences between the step kids and her child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sarah is a selfish, egotistical AH ruled by insecurities and a need to lord over children.  She's so lucky they accepted her in the first place and she takes that for granted by demanding more?  Why did she get into this relationship in the first place?  Very suspect motives.\n\nJames is an AH for marrying and then reproducing with a woman who looks at his children as objects that should be worshipping her.  He's also an AH for trying to push it on the kids.  What magical bits does Sarah have to make him tell to sell out his kid's feelings like that?", "Nta but your sister is.", "NTA, your rationale seems fair. Like what someone else says your sister may benefit from therapy", "This is a complex situation. Sarah is not an AH; anyone who says that should have a bit of compassion. We don\u2019t know what goes on in their marriage today. As for OP, AH depends on three things we as readers have no transparency into: the nature of her relationship with her sister and the intent of the remark and how OP\u2019s point was made (words used, tone and context such as trigger, timing, place, who else was around to hear it).", "NTA. Sarah could probably benefit from therapy. It sounds like she is very lucky to be in the situation shes in, but if she doesnt learn how to manage her jealousy, she could destroy it.", "NTA. I think she needed to hear it and it doesnt sound like you delivered it in a mean way. She is teetering on ruining the good relationship that she has with her stepchildren by pushing too hard and trying to get them to replace their mom. Pretty sure she can still be appointed a guardian in a will so that's not an excuse for the adoption. Being jealous of a deceased person is not healthy behavior. She might benefit from some counseling.", "NTA Sarah is going to end up making those kids resent her because they are going to start feeling smothered by her resentment of their mother. The fact that she tried to say they looked like her; she couldn\u2019t stand them having their favorite connection to their mother is really awful."]}
