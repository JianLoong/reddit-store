How is wrapping your arms around a pillow to sleep any different than a stuffed animal? Stuffed animals are just fun shaped pillows.\n\nETA: I\u2019m really enjoying reading about everyone\u2019s stuffed animals. Brings a little bit of love to my morning. \n\nMy bear was made for me by my parents at Build A Bear when I was a teenager and going through a rough time. After a couple of years, the threads on one of his eyes started to come loose, so I used cotton medical tape to hold it in place. As a result, I started calling him Nelly, because he now had an under eye bandage like the rapper had lol. Nelly sits on my couch now, and he makes me smile when I see him. \n\nWhen you go to Build A Bear, before they put the bear\u2019s heart in, they have you make a wish. I\u2019ve never asked my parents what wish they made, but I\u2019m assuming it had to do with me being in a better place than I was at the time. I\u2019m happy to say I\u2019m much better, happier, and healthier than I was back then. So I suppose their wish came true. \ud83e\uddf8", "NTA\n\nYou were right, she was being controlling.

If I had a bf that slept with one, I'd get in bed behind him and be the 'big' spoon while he hugged it :D", "Fuckit dude. Do you and people with either respect and cherish you, or not. I think it's hella cute you still sleep with a stuffed animal. I had a stuffed panda for the longest time and Idk where it ended up, but I have two matching pillow cases with cute little pandas on it and I'm a 30 y/o 7 ft tall man.

When I was packing to meet my then future inlaws, my partner asked me why I took a doll. I just said Rosie had been with me when no one else was, and I wasn't prepared to stop sleeping with her. He just shrugged and said ok. And ever since then, every time we've moved, he's made she she's all packed up and safe. And even though I no longer sleep with her, our daughter does. And even though he isn't very sentimental, he cares enough about us that he takes care that those items don't get lost.\n\nYour girlfriend doesn't have to get it, but she needs to respect it.

I'm a lady, and I doubt at any age I would have felt like that was \"embarrassing\" and \"not masculine\" for a male partner to do. And I find taking your stuffed shark from to be you quite cruel. Adults don't care about this sort of thing, she's being incredibly childish. Worse, honestly I would have thought this to be sweet at a much younger age than her, even. \n\n\nI don't usually comment on these, but this made me sad so I wanted to reassure you.
