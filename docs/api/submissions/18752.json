She got me a ticket anyways. I refused to skip work and she grounded me for not using the ticket she bought me. She said it was my fault she got the ticket because I said I wanted to go to ren fest. Even if I paid her back, we still wasted money on it. At the time I didn\u2019t say anything because my siblings were there, but it bothered me she was trying to ground me. \r  \n\r  \nThe following afternoon I wanted to make a quick run to the gas station so I wouldn\u2019t have to stop for gas in the morning when I\u2019m rushing to get my siblings to school on time.

I told her I\u2019m too old to be grounded and I can go where I want as long as I\u2019m not coming home late. She argued she can still ground me and I\u2019m not allowed out of the house.

When my mom got home she was pissed she had to take my siblings to school. It made her very late to work and she missed something important. She gave me my stuff back and let me leave to get a tank of gas. \r  \n\r  \nMy aunt called me childish for running away just because I was grounded.

You leaving the house and going about your business is not stupid it\u2019s actually quite smart. You left an intense situation and instead of fighting with her in front of your siblings, you stayed at a friends house. Whether or not it was intentional you didn\u2019t have your phone to even inform her of where you were (thanks to her genius idea). So if she expects an apology from you then you should be expecting some payment for taking her children to school. That is not your job it\u2019s hers.

But when you're doing things like helping her with childcare (taking your siblings to school) and getting groceries, as well as working a job and being a student, your mom doesn't get to say you're grounded. Her grounding you could make you lose your job, or miss class. You're an adult. While no, your brain isn't fully developed at 18, you're legally considered an adult", "NAH, yet. As someone who was once in your shoes (*technically* an adult with a mom who relied on them to take up many \u201cco-parenting\u201d and house management duties), I can safely say you and your mom are at a delicate crossroads. You moving from \u201cchild\u201d to \u201cadult\u201d is hitting a little differently for each of you.\n\nI can imagine you feel like with the things you handle for your mom, that you feel like she should be treating you as more of an equal adult. She\u2019s your mom, and she\u2019s always going to be your mom, but it seems like she\u2019s struggling with recognizing you are growing and are going to have your own responsibilities that may have to come before her wants. I recommend once both of you cool off a little, sitting down and trying to talk calmly about the situation and your dynamic going forward. Otherwise, you two are likely to keep butting heads over and over until it ends ip causing lasting damage to your relationship.", "ESH Reddit likes to argue that 18 is adult but you are still in school and living at home.  Yes, you are still subject to your parent\u2019s authority. Unless you are emancipated and graduated or ged or have an alternate plan and you live separately, 18 is not magically too old.  \n\nHowever, your parent misused authority.  Grounding because you had to work is unreasonable.  The consequence for you not going to a thing you said you wanted to go to should have been \u2026 you missing the thing.  If that made everyone else miss it (vehicle limits or whatever) then you would have to help resell tickets or cover loss perhaps, but in this case, you just didn\u2019t go.  No wonder you refused to comply with that punishment.  \n\nBut \u2026 it\u2019s still an A H move to be a dependent and run away/out when you are safe but aggravated.  You did set a bad example and you sound responsible enough to talk to your siblings about that.", "YTA I do understand she was being unreasonable by saying work wasnt a good enough reason to miss the festival but running away is not ok. You do live at home and you need to follow the rules until you move out. It sounds like that should happen sooner than later. Yes she can ground you, you live in her home. You may be 18 but you don\u2019t own or rent the home you live in. Your aunt has nothing to do with any of this. She can mind her own business. You said your mom had no idea where you were because you weren\u2019t answering your phone. \n\nEarlier you said your mom took your phone. Why would she call your phone if she took it?", "[deleted]", "NTA  First, her reason for grounding you is utterly ridiculous. If your going to buy a ticket for an event for someone else, it's your responsibility to ensure that they aren't busy on that day, or bear the costs if they aren't. Skipping work would have been a punishable offense, not missingthe eventfor work. How hard you tried to find a replacement is irrelevant, responsibilitys you committed to before fun you were gifted. To reiterate, *wasted money incurred because she didn't ensure you were available before spending is her fault, not yours*. Dicipline should always carry a lesson, all I see here is her flexing her power to establish authority over you, no lesson learned. \n\nThe argument on the other hand,  is more of an E S H, but I'll give you a pass due to the reason you were being punished. Being 18 in no way protects you from being grounded, she retains that right until you either move out or start paying rent. Instead of arguing you should have *explained the household tasks you were trying to undertake*, not told her she couldn't punish you. She had every right to be worried while you were missing, but cannot blame you for not using the phone she had confiscated. Similarly, she can't blame you for being late due to unexpectedly needing to take your siblings to school. She knew, for better or worse, you had left the previous evening and that you can't drive with key and license confiscated, and ultimatelyit is the parentsresponsibilityto ensurethe kids get places on time, not yours. (Plus no/low gas, but she may not have known that)", "ESH- you told your mother you couldn\u2019t go because you couldn\u2019t get anyone to cover your shift. She didn\u2019t listen and still got the ticket and got mad that you didn\u2019t go because you had to work and wasted the ticket even though you had told her you had to work and couldn\u2019t go to begin with. She grounded you for this when it was her fault for buying the ticket after she was told you weren\u2019t going. That was a major AH move. \n\nThen you still live in her house , telling her she can\u2019t ground you just because you are 18, and have a job. Since you still live in the home, under her roof, you very much can and will still be grounded. You can\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t do when she is the parent and you still live under her roof and rules regardless of your age and job. No , she should not have grounded you for her own mistake but you can\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t do because that made the situation entirely worse by running away and not answering your phone.  \n\nINFO- do you pay for your phone and car and credit cards and bought your laptop? Cause if she does then again, she can still tell you what you can and can\u2019t do.", "NTA you were leaving the house to get food for the house and to get gas to make dropping your siblings off easier.
