{"id": 32487, "submission_id": "18cejxy", "title": "AITA for removing my cousin from my Amazon prime account?", "selftext": "Okay, so my cousin (19F) grew up in a really sheltered family, and this summer, she moved out of the house and has been getting exposed to the real world. She is in community college and got a part-time job, and she has been looking to get more into movies and TV since she wasn't allowed to watch a lot growing up. I (25F) am a huge film/TV nerd and own over 300 movies on my Amazon account. On a whim because I was excited for her, I gave her the info for my amazon account so she could log in and watch movies in my library. I said upfront I was giving her the account info because I'd be happy to share a lot of the movies I like with her. This was all back in late May.\n\n  \nNext thing I know, she's entered her credit card info and address into the account and is buying clothes all the time. She's never once charged anything to my card, but she's been using the free shipping/prime item discounts/all the prime benefits while I still pay the $14.99 a month prime membership in full. I have largely kept my mouth shut because she's very sweet, but recently I have not had time to use the account as much, so I was kind of starting to feel like I was paying for \\*her\\* to have a prime membership.\n\n  \nI locked my card recently without realizing that, instead of pausing like it's done in the past when I lock my card, Amazon automatically would charge the next active card on the account, which was hers. She texts me freaking out that $16 has been charged to her card without her ordering anything, and she's stressed now because she needs that money for Christmas gifts (by the way, she bought more clothes a week ago, since I get sent receipts for all her orders). I looked into it and explained the situation: that the prime membership that has all the benefits (she mostly uses--but I didn't say that part) costs $14.99 a month (I just assumed she knew that, but I decided to make it clear in case she didn't) and I pay for it, and it accidentally charged her card instead of mine, and I offered to Venmo her $16. She's a very considerate person, so I just thought, hey, maybe she'll offer to pay half since I'm sure she's going to use the membership to buy Christmas gifts. Her response was simply \"Thx, I have cash app.\" I feel like she is really taking advantage of what I originally offered (especially since she knows I'm on a tight budget in grad school).\n\n  \nAITA for being a little upset/removing her from the account (I haven't done this yet but am trying to think of a way to go about it--I don't think it's fair if she uses the account for Christmas gifts while refusing to pay for any of the membership).\n\nEDIT: I sent her the money and removed her card/info, reset my password, and signed out of the account across devices so she no longer has access. I think it should be added for context that her initial texts to me about the charge were accusatory, like I had ordered something and charged her card (even after I sent screenshots that the last order was her for clothing and the last digital order I made was last month). That influenced my emotions a bit in creating this post.\n\nOther edit: in terms of the whole \u201chousehold\u201d thing\u2014we are not super close in the way siblings or parents are. We talk from time to time (I offered her the movie watching during one of those conversations), but we otherwise live in different states and lead pretty separate lives. The most we\u2019ve talked recently was when she called me to ask me to accept a refund confirmation for one of her purchases that had been sent to my email.", "created_utc": 1701897588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cejxy/aita_for_removing_my_cousin_from_my_amazon_prime/", "score": 303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re okay with her using it for free to watch movies but not to buy stuff.

Just change the passwords and remove her. It was in part her own misuse of your account that caused the accidental charge, and that was her chance to step up and be a bit more appreciative than simply demanding reimbursement (which I do agree you owed her).

And if you don't want to face backlash you could always be like \"Amazon contacted me questioning multiple households using the prime membership\" but I also encourage you to go the more straightforward route, along the lines of \"It wasn't my intent for you to have full utilization of my Amazon account, so after the mishap with your credit card getting charged I thought it was best if we discontinued the sharing.\"", "NTA she absolutely should have asked if she could add her card and order things through your account.", "NTA.
