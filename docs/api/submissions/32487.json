{"id": 32487, "submission_id": "18cejxy", "title": "AITA for removing my cousin from my Amazon prime account?", "selftext": "Okay, so my cousin (19F) grew up in a really sheltered family, and this summer, she moved out of the house and has been getting exposed to the real world. She is in community college and got a part-time job, and she has been looking to get more into movies and TV since she wasn't allowed to watch a lot growing up. I (25F) am a huge film/TV nerd and own over 300 movies on my Amazon account. On a whim because I was excited for her, I gave her the info for my amazon account so she could log in and watch movies in my library. I said upfront I was giving her the account info because I'd be happy to share a lot of the movies I like with her. This was all back in late May.\n\n  \nNext thing I know, she's entered her credit card info and address into the account and is buying clothes all the time. She's never once charged anything to my card, but she's been using the free shipping/prime item discounts/all the prime benefits while I still pay the $14.99 a month prime membership in full. I have largely kept my mouth shut because she's very sweet, but recently I have not had time to use the account as much, so I was kind of starting to feel like I was paying for \\*her\\* to have a prime membership.\n\n  \nI locked my card recently without realizing that, instead of pausing like it's done in the past when I lock my card, Amazon automatically would charge the next active card on the account, which was hers. She texts me freaking out that $16 has been charged to her card without her ordering anything, and she's stressed now because she needs that money for Christmas gifts (by the way, she bought more clothes a week ago, since I get sent receipts for all her orders). I looked into it and explained the situation: that the prime membership that has all the benefits (she mostly uses--but I didn't say that part) costs $14.99 a month (I just assumed she knew that, but I decided to make it clear in case she didn't) and I pay for it, and it accidentally charged her card instead of mine, and I offered to Venmo her $16. She's a very considerate person, so I just thought, hey, maybe she'll offer to pay half since I'm sure she's going to use the membership to buy Christmas gifts. Her response was simply \"Thx, I have cash app.\" I feel like she is really taking advantage of what I originally offered (especially since she knows I'm on a tight budget in grad school).\n\n  \nAITA for being a little upset/removing her from the account (I haven't done this yet but am trying to think of a way to go about it--I don't think it's fair if she uses the account for Christmas gifts while refusing to pay for any of the membership).\n\nEDIT: I sent her the money and removed her card/info, reset my password, and signed out of the account across devices so she no longer has access. I think it should be added for context that her initial texts to me about the charge were accusatory, like I had ordered something and charged her card (even after I sent screenshots that the last order was her for clothing and the last digital order I made was last month). That influenced my emotions a bit in creating this post.", "created_utc": 1701897588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cejxy/aita_for_removing_my_cousin_from_my_amazon_prime/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You haven\u2019t done that yet and some people have no context clues to understand that you wanted her to pay half.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t see what the big deal is. You\u2019re okay with her using it for free to watch movies but not to buy stuff. Her using it to buy things doesn\u2019t change the membership for you so if you\u2019re on such a tight budget ask her for half or turn it off.", "NTA.\n\nOn a side note, I wish amazon had an option for a streaming only login.", "NAH in my opinion.  You wouldn't be the asshole to change your passwords and lock her out of the account, but have you, at any point, thought about canceling the prime account? If the answer is no, then it's not really costing you anything to allow her to use the account.  You would already be paying for it even if she weren't logged on.  So no you would NTA, but I think you're making a bigger deal of it than you need to.", "NTA to block her.  You offered her Amazon to share your moves, not for her to piggyback your account and order shit for free shipping.\n\nBlock her.", "NTA.  You need to be straight forward with her and discuss the options she has:\n\n1.  Either you tell her that If she wants to continue to use your Prime account she has to pay half.  \n\n2.  Or, you tell her that you no longer want to share the Prime account with her.\n\n3.  Or, you tell her you are giving up Prime and if she wants it then she can take over paying for it.  [you can be sneaky here and change all pw and reactivate Prime once she gets her own account if you want to continue having it but do not want a confrontation - however it is best to be straight forward]", "NTA. Just change the passwords and remove her. It was in part her own misuse of your account that caused the accidental charge, and that was her chance to step up and be a bit more appreciative than simply demanding reimbursement (which I do agree you owed her). It is time to end her freeloading - sharing media is one thing but sharing an entire Amazon account with benefits is another. \n\nYou can tell her ahead of time or not. And if you don't want to face backlash you could always be like \"Amazon contacted me questioning multiple households using the prime membership\" but I also encourage you to go the more straightforward route, along the lines of \"It wasn't my intent for you to have full utilization of my Amazon account, so after the mishap with your credit card getting charged I thought it was best if we discontinued the sharing.\"", "NTA she absolutely should have asked if she could add her card and order things through your account.", "NTA.  I would just say, hey, I'm not comfortable sharing my amazon account with your credit card.  This situation shows its not a good idea and I'm thinking of canceling prime soon anyway.  I don't use it.  You can get a prime student account for cheap.", "NTA.\n\nBut because she is young, and because she has had such a sheltered life, and because she is learning, you should have a talk with her about it.\n\nBTW, you can put pin number on your amazon account so that purchases can't be made without entering the pin.  I did this when my grandson was using my prime account for the same purposes, so that he couldn't accidently buy/rent movies.", "This is literally a non issue. What is it hurting you that she\u2019s using the free shipping aspect? My siblings all have my Netflix that I pay for, we all use my dad\u2019s Amazon prime. \n\nQuite being an asshole because you can\u2019t take advantage of family. YTA", "NTA but you should both be able to get cheaper memberships with a student discount.", "As usual, I find the update/edit very suspicious. It is a very important detail that she accused you of that. Why wouldn't you have included that to begin with?\n\nBecause otherwise, I think you're getting a bit bent out of shape that she was using it for free shipping.  So what?  That's the popular thing that people do with subscription accounts.  If I were to give someone access to an sub I'd pay I simply expect them to not cost me anything. She wasn't harming you in any way.", "NTA. Change the password and explain.\n\nI have a bunch of streaming services I subscribe to and I've shared passwords with people for SPECIFIC shows. Turns out they think I invited them to just have complete access to my subscriptions! One couple was passing it on to their adult kids FFS! \n\nNeedless to say, I change passwords on the regular.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was just upset that she started using the actual prime membership without contributing at all.", "This should be top comment. It may not be something she wants to hear, but luxuries cost money. In my opinion, a prime account is a luxury.", "I feel like she was taking advantage of me because she\u2019s using parts of my account that I pay for without ever asking if she could and then started texting me in an accusing manner when she accidentally gets charged for those benefits. It\u2019s one thing if you have an agreement worked out upfront with your family, but she literally never even asked if she could use the actual membership, just started doing it. And how did I take advantage of her in any way? I sent her the money that was charged, but I\u2019m kicking her off of the account because I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s fair for her to keep taking advantage of benefits (that she never asked me if she could use) while I pay all of the monthly fee for those benefits.", "I don't think I can since I already used the student discount in college (it has a limit of 3-4 years, I believe) and I don't know if it applies to grad students.", "I'm not good at writing long posts and have a hard time organizing my thoughts. I said she texted me \"freaking out\" in the original post -- she was freaking out at me specifically. And it's one thing to have an actual upfront agreement with someone that you share the account and each pay for half, or one person specifically volunteers to pay for everyone, but she never asked if she could use the prime part (I told her upfront she could log into the account to watch movies in my film library), and I just don't feel comfortable anymore her expecting me to pay the full monthly fee for a service she never asked if she could use to begin with and is now using more than I do. I already updated that I've removed her.", "If it was a one-time use, I would have said sure. If she had asked if she could start ordering things, I would have explained that I have to pay a monthly fee for the discounts/free shipping and asked if she'd like to split the cost of the membership with me if she was going to use it regularly, especially considering she's on her own and has a job.
