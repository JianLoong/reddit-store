I don't see this as functionally different than if the kid wanted to go to some carnivore-tastic steakhouse and he had vegetarian relatives who would have nothing to eat there.\n\n**Kids don't _get_ a lot of control in life.** And a dinner like this is the one chance for the kid to have things their way. Frankly, accommodating *others* is a teaching moment for *another* day.", "This is a case where the child has become the parent. Op your son son was being kind, your husband... draw your own conclusions.", "Way worse than a grump", "Sounds like her husband is ableist.", "I don't understand why the husband gives a flying fuck and thinks the inaccessible option is so important.", "Her 9 year old son's incredibly kind and generous decision overshadowed the whole story.", "Nothing to our family but he was an AH to his wife/my SIL. Basically, he was rude and ungrateful and taught my niece to be rude to my SIL. He didn\u2019t mean the jokingly mean things he said and did really love her, but it came a point where she was getting negatively compared to a friend who moved in with them. That friend tried to have an affair with my brother when my SIL was in the hospital and that was the wake up call he needed to kick her out.\n\nSIL was very injured and it traumatized the entire family. My brother and niece lived with me and my family when this happened. My husband\u2019s dislike of my brother came from that period because he said my brother was self righteous and trying to make up for being a bad husband to SIL.\n\nSIL went through hell. She had to be placed in a medical coma and she was dying for a long time. We didn\u2019t think she\u2019d pull through but she did. She\u2019s now in a wheelchair and still suffering physical and mentally. My brother stepped up and worships her. He\u2019s taken care of everything and took another job so that he can be her full time carer.", "Probably drugs or jail.", "NTA This is excellent parenting! Your child is growing up with empathy! We don't seem to focus on this ability enough, in my opinion. Despite what the public believes, decent guys don't always finish last! Excellent work, and Matt, happy birthday!", "Cmon man, on the list of ways to fuck up as a parent being \u2018overly grumpy your kid didn\u2019t get to go to his favorite restaurant for his birthday\u2019 seems like small potatoes.", "I definitely will! I was thinking of getting takeout but I can make it another trip to the Thai restaurant itself.", "I never realized how unaccommodating everywhere is until I had to push a stroller around. I got especially mad in the baby clothes store since they clearly weren't catering to mothers haha.", "But what if the kid WANTS those family members there??\n\nYou are assuming he cares more about the restaurant than the people who attend. It sounds like it's actually the opposite. The kid having things HIS WAY is, in this case, having the family there.", "A disability with no access to a place is a bit different to an ethical or dietary eating choice.   Every steak house has salad. They have a choice to go or not.", "OP says in a comment that it's his favorite auntie. And that he would be sad if she and his granny couldn't be there. \n\nAll she did was tell him that because it isn't accessible, they would not be able to go. OP did not tell him he had to pick somewhere else. She just informed him of how it would work out.\n\nHe then made the choice on his own, because he would rather have those 2 family members there than not have them there.", "It's functionally different because while a vegetarian could come but not eat, a disabled person could not come at all. It's not personal preference, but a practical impossibility. \n\nIt sounds like OP didn't veto the Thai, just reminded him that if he chose it then Aunt and Grandma could not be there too. So he changed it to something everyone could attend.", "Sometimes people are a little silly in the moment.\n\nDoes it really have to be so melodramatic?", "She should marry her son instead?", "Right??\n\n> He thinks I pushed Matt to choose another restaurant because I\u2019m afraid of my brother throwing a fit that his wife\u2019s disability needs weren\u2019t considered. \n\nImagine *accusing* someone of that - uh yeah, most people would want to consider a family member\u2019s disability needs during a family event\u2026", "Was she in the hospital because of him?", "One of the worst offenders is Hot Topic!  I get draped in t-shirts every time my kids take me in there!  But my family has also learned *a lot* about sidewalk quality, ramps, etc.  We didn\u2019t have to know about that stuff much before, but now they\u2019re all very sensitive to it.\n\nIt\u2019s just something folks don\u2019t really think about much until they have to, and I get that.  But that\u2019s also why I\u2019m glad people like OP are making an effort to teach their kids about it.", "Freud is rolling in his grave right now.", "Well, they do say that a boy's best friend is his mother.", "Omg Hot Topic sounds like a nightmare \ud83d\ude2d it's barely accessible for people walking as it is lol", "So's Oedipus!"]}
