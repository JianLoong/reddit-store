To me, it sounds like all you did is remind him (a 9 yr old who may not always think about what disabilities are and how they might affect where people can go/what they can do) that certain family members might not be able to celebrate with him at that location. Then he decided on his own to change locations.\n\nIt sounds like your son made a mature and informed choice, but if your husband is really concerned, then you can ask your son again, emphasizing that it's his birthday and no one will be upset with him for what he chooses.

I am a parent of a child with a disability.  Sometimes this means he cannot go to birthday parties, for example, he wasn't able to go when friend had a trampoline park birthday.  I didn't throw a fit at the parent because my son wasn't being accommodated.  Instead, I used it as a teaching moment to explain to my son that he won't always be able to go to everything.  I then, took him to do something fun, and we met up with that family later to let the kids play at the accessible playground.  Similarly, my daughter has wanted to have birthday parties doing things my son cannot do.  We will explain to her what this means for her brother, but I still allow my daughter to have the birthday she wants.  I want my daughter to know that her needs do not have to come second.  She is very good about being considerate of her brother.  She loves him very much, but sometimes still wants to do things other kids do, and that is okay.", "This has nothing to do with an adult throwing a tantrum that his child changed his mind immediately when he realized his granny and aunt would not be able to be with him at his birthday dinner.

And if we want to consider the scenario of an adult planning a bday dinner and choosing a historical location that turns out to be inaccessible to some of his friends, then he'd have to decide between changing location or excluding those friends, which is an entirely other kind of aita post.", "That's exactly my take on the situation.
