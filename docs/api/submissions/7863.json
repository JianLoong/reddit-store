Cody's mother won't let him have anyone at her house. \n\nCody and his friends generally like to go into the playroom and play video games and banter and eat. My 9yo son Julian tries to hangout with them but Cody will kick him out because he's \"annoying.\" Hes not annoying. That's just an excuse. This is true because sometimes my 7yo son will be hanging off Cody's friends or sitting on their laps or rough housing.\n\nI feel bad for Julian because he takes it very personally. If Cody let him hangout then it would do wonders for his pride and he'd end up getting bored after an hour and leave. Thr most he'd do is observe and maybe play video games. \n\nI told Cody this and he says he doesn't care. So I said if he wants to turn my house into The Max or The Peach Pit then he has to start letting Julian hang out for a bit. \n\nAnd like all his friends have little brothers so it's not a big deal.\n\nEdit: Literally one of my son's friend has my 7yo on his lap watching YouTube videos on an iPad and they were building Legos right before.

Yes, they definitely should be polite and kind to them but expecting them to include such young kids in video games doesn\u2019t make sense. Things 16 yrs old talk about when parents aren\u2019t around and the video games they play aren\u2019t age appropriate for 7 & 9 yr olds. \n\nWhy are you pushing this for either younger child?", "So... you're, basically, forcing your older son to include your younger son in on the older son's life, thereby making your older son resent their relationship. \n\nYTA", "Laughed out loud at \"The Max\" and \"The Peach Pit\". You and I are clearly the exact same age. That said, you might be the asshole here. 7 years is a massive age gap and (as a fellow former 9 year old and current parent of a 9 year old) 9 year olds are probably the most annoying age despite how much we love them and appreciate their quirks and developing personalities. \n\nI'd say that you should continue talking to him and encouraging him to include Cody but that you shouldn't force it because then he'll start to resent the poor kid (and you).", "YTA. Your older son is going to old a lot of resent towards his younger brother and also you for forcing him to let Julian hang out.

Knock it off before you wreck your child.", "YTA.  There's a reason why Cody and his friends are cool with the 7 year old and not the 9 year old: 7 year olds are still cute and 9 year olds are awkward as all get out.

This will impact your relationship with your son and may lead to alienation between you and him in the long run.\n\nA 9-YO should be hanging with CHILDREN, not teenagers.\n\nHelp your younger son by giving him activities where he can socialize with kids his own age.\n\nIf you want a bond to be built and time spent between the siblings, create a \"family time\" where the whole family hangs out or does something, but don't try to ruin your older son's social life by forcing his little brother on him.\n\nMy parents did this kind of thing....I HATED my tag-a-long sister for years because of this.

I'm betting this all goes way deeper than you think.\n\nEither way, the age gap is too big for grade-schoolers to hang out with a group of high schoolers. Let Cody have his friends. Otherwise, this probably doesn't end well for anyone in a couple of years.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

It is ok to ask but not ok to force it.", "YTA. If they're OK with the younger kid and not the older, then he's probably telling the truth about the 9 year old being annoying.\n\nYou're not asking him to hang out with his brother.

The way you're going, you're going to end up with siblings who will have nothing to do with each other when hey grow up.

There is a difference between 16yo, 9yo, and 7yo.  Guessing Cody & his friends see the 7yo as a little kid but see the 9yo as older.  Also, the interaction with Cody & his friends is likely to be different.\n\nYou shouldn't put the parenting on Cody & his friends.  It is not their responsibility to entertain your 9yo.  I suggest you work with your 9yo to foster friendships with kids around his own age.  Also, if you want the kids to spend time together, then when you have them, plan some family time activities for you and the kids.  Then they will get to know each other and forge bonds.", "YTA and I'm pretty sure this is going to be a popular opinion. 9 and 16 is a massive age gap and they have little in common. Cody's friends don't want to hang out with a 9 year old either. You need to help Julian some friends, not force it on Cody. You'll cause issues between cody and julian, and cause cody to resent you. This is not the solution.\n\nGet Julian involved in sports or other extracurricular activities where he will meet other boys. Ask Julian who his friends are and arrange playdates with them. You could hang out with Julian. If Julian is lacking friends at school, try to find out why that is. Is he socially awkward? Is he getting bullied?", "YTA. Your kids aren\u2019t gonna have a relationship when they grow up because of YOUR interference. \nThey\u2019re not 1 or 2 years apart ffs.

Why not compromise and ask Cody to have a friend with a brother Julian\u2019s age come and hang out once a week.  It\u2019s a crap move to decide that a 16 year old (high school junior) has to hang out with a 9 year old (4th grader).  For future reference an elementary school kid will always be annoying to a high school kid.", "He thinks his little brother is annoying and doesn't want him hanging out with his friends.

Stop being obtuse and obstinate", "YTA\n\nA 16 year old is going to find a 9 year old annoying. 9 year olds have such a different way to approach life and obviously different interests to a 16 year old. And I speak from experience parents trying to force a bond causes resentment even if subconscious took me so many years to find out thats why I can't stand my brother. Think about it, would you like someone your forced to hang out with? \n\nYour problem is your only focusing on Julian...Cody is equally your son. This time is for his friends, he invited them over cause he wants to hang out with them not cause he wants to share time with his brother or babysit him. A 16 year olds conversations won't be child appropiate most of the time or will be dtuff Julian has no knowledge of in this case Cody will either have to explain it or try to protect Julian's innocence. I never wanted to be on full alert and have to look after my brother or censor everything for him so didn't take him.\n\nFriends also share secrets or times they did something they should have got in trouble for can't do that with little brother there.

YTA just from that title alone, poor kid, it SUCKS when your parents make the younger ones join, it\u2019s so awkward for everyone. \n\nYou literally made my eye twitch, let your son have his own friends.", "YTA. Not for trying to look out for Julian, it's well intended though somewhat misguided. Don't make your kids hang out. Especially with age gaps it's tricky. I have 6 years between me and my younger sibling and during puberty that gap was too wide to bridge.   \nAnd the few times my parents asked me to take them with me, I resented my sibling a little more. \n\nFor whatever reason (doesn't have to be reasonable or logical at this age) Cody doesn't want Julian there. \n\nSo either tell Cody to take his friends and hang somewhere else. Or find another way to boost Julian's confidence.", "Yeah you\u2019re a major ah, I remember being 16 with my first bf and his mom made his 9 year old brother hang out with us all the time.

You should be hanging out with your younger son and encouraging him to bring friends his own age to your house.", "As someone who has been around 7 and 9 YOs, 7 YOs are still kind, loving and more innocent. 9 yos boys are more mature, can be rude, smarty pants, gross and more annoying. That could be why Cody allows the 7YO hang out and kicks Julian out.  \n\nHonestly, I would sit down and find out why your Cody treats them differently before making demands.  It could be you need to sit down with Julian about his behavior.\n\nKeep in mind you making this demand could result in less time with Cody being home.  Me personally, I would prefer my kid being home.\n\nGood luck.", "INFO: Does Cody have a large enough private space to host himself and his friends? \n\nIn my house we had a rule when it came to having people over, if you wanted time along with your friends you needed to go to your room. \n\nIf you were in the common areas, then you had to accept that other people might be around.

You\u2019re the 9year olds parent, Ofc YOU don\u2019t see him as annoying (which is a good thing) but a sibling at that age will think their sibling is annoying and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. \n\nAnd trying to get people to hangout when it\u2019s one sided is never a good idea, your 16 year old could resent his brother AND you.", "Nope.

I don\u2019t care if he is the cutest kid to ever walk the face of this earth. You do not Force relationships it does nothing but make things worse.   Your 16yo will absolutely resent your other son and also eventually go no contact with you. \n\nIt is absolutely clear you have a favorite and could care less about your oldest. His feelings mean nothing to you and it is clear.  Since you think your 9 year old is just the worlds greatest kid then you hang out with him, you play with him.
