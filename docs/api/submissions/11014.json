And my answer is \"it depends.\"  I think the dividing line is whether there is an intentional and long-term decision on the part of both parents for one of them to be a stay-at-home parent.  When there's a mutual decision for someone to become a stay-at-home parent, yeah, I would be offended by the other parent calling the stay-at-home parent (of either gender) a maid.\n\nAnd just because one person has the only or primary income, that doesn't necessarily mean that the other person should be doing all the chores and childcare, because there's no end to the work when there are children involved.\n\nIn a less planned situation where both parents are in a role they didn't choose, I think there's some leeway for joking about the unexpected roles from both sides, but only if they're both okay with it.  If someone with less insecurity were the object of such a joke, they'd spring back with something like, \"just wait until I get back to work and you have to start pulling your weight around here.\"  I don't think using the term \"maid\" is out of line for either parent where they're playing a temporary role for a short time that may feel to them too more like being a \"maid\" than the role in the partnership that they're used to having and want to have.  But yeah, if the term is causing the at-home partner grief, then stop using it.  She could say something more like, \"well, it's nice having someone at home doing my share of the housework while I'm out at work\" or something.\n\nBoth DH and I have had times when we were the primary earner and the other contributed more in other ways.  We might both have joked about ourselves being the \"maid\" in such a situation, which is why I didn't think it was especially offensive.
