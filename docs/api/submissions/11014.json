And my answer is \"it depends.\"  I think the dividing line is whether there is an intentional and long-term decision on the part of both parents for one of them to be a stay-at-home parent.  When there's a mutual decision for someone to become a stay-at-home parent, yeah, I would be offended by the other parent calling the stay-at-home parent (of either gender) a maid.\n\nAnd just because one person has the only or primary income, that doesn't necessarily mean that the other person should be doing all the chores and childcare, because there's no end to the work when there are children involved.\n\nIn a less planned situation where both parents are in a role they didn't choose, I think there's some leeway for joking about the unexpected roles from both sides, but only if they're both okay with it.  If someone with less insecurity were the object of such a joke, they'd spring back with something like, \"just wait until I get back to work and you have to start pulling your weight around here.\"  I don't think using the term \"maid\" is out of line for either parent where they're playing a temporary role for a short time that may feel to them too more like being a \"maid\" than the role in the partnership that they're used to having and want to have.  But yeah, if the term is causing the at-home partner grief, then stop using it.  She could say something more like, \"well, it's nice having someone at home doing my share of the housework while I'm out at work\" or something.\n\nBoth DH and I have had times when we were the primary earner and the other contributed more in other ways.

She\u2019s just making light of a temporary situation, in which stereotypical gender roles are reversed. To me, the only reason why somebody would feel so emasculated or offended by this is because they do actually think of it as demeaning work- which to me comes from a very macho/egotistical pov. Also what\u2019s wrong with being a maid? I feel like being so offended by this is demeaning to people who are actually maids, which is a very honest and decent profession that is not a job exclusive to women.

As an example, your partner says they're tired of you never doing the dishes and you respond \"But I did them yesterday\" knowing full well you didn't do them and they did but you want them to believe you did and doubt their own memory. That would be the beginning of gaslighting.\n\n\nActual gaslighting typically isn't a one-off though. In the example above that is gaslighting, but usually the term is referring to a.manipulation tactic designed to fuck with someone's mind over an extended period. The goal would be to create a more submissive partner that you can continue to abuse by effectively making then doubt themselves. Actual gaslighting is a horrible form of abuse, just lying to your partner or disrespecting their boundaries isn't gaslighting. When people call random things gaslighting  they're obscuring the meaning of the term and minimizing actual gaslighting victims' experience.\n\n\nIn this scenario the girlfriend IS being verbally abusive and trying to demean OP's role in their household, that's fucked up, but not really gaslighting.", "This subs obsession with insecurity is deranged and idiotic.\n\nNewsflash for you: almost everyone in the fucking world is \u201can insecure person.\u201d It\u2019s just a way to make others feel worse; what you\u2019re insecure about is valid.
