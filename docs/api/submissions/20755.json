Beyond knowing that when I give my name I have to follow it up with the spelling, it causes no other inconvenience to my life. Hell I have to do the same for my last name since it's also a common first name that can be spelled a variety of ways. It's really not that big of a deal.

I quite like the names, and funnily enough also the name Ocean, but my opinion is irrelevant as the only opinion that counts is yours and the kids dad's.
