They said the names were cool. My niece said she had a girl in her class called Wren and she thinks the name is really pretty. My nephew said one of his friends Skyler goes by Sky and he liked that. Said something about telling his friend. My nephew also said he wished his name was cooler like theirs. I said his name was cool too. He didn't really respond to that. My brother then jumps in and says the boys names aren't cool and they have the coolest names of all because they will grow up and sound really professional when they are older with their names and how my nephew can start going by his name when he's older. He uses a nickname for his middle name because he doesn't like his first name.\n\nSIL then asked the kids if they didn't find the names girly and told the kids they should love their own names more than their cousins.

I told them if they hate my kids names, fine. But they can't make their kids hate them and by making such a big deal, in my home, in front of me, they are being rude.

Saying your kids should be ashamed of their names was way over the line.  You were right to kick them out, and if they can't respect you and your choices in naming your kids, you shouldn't allow them to come over at all.

But, also, Robin has been a name for a very long time. And Wren has been around for a while too. There's a character in Guys and Dolls called Skye.

Essentially, they are teaching their children that it\u2019s OK not to like someone\u2019s name and maybe even not like someone because of their name. It\u2019s never appropriate to offer your opinion on someone\u2019s name unless they specifically ask you, even then you need to be careful how you respond.", "Absolutely NTA. They were way out of line. And childish as hell. I can't imagine grown adults teaching their children to hate someone or that they are better than others, based on their names. They sound insecure and boring, too. Sheesh. I hope they realize how crazy they sound and apologize.", "NTA - your family is being judgmental and your kids can also pick up different nicknames if necessary, which I doubt since their names are completely appropriate. I am so sorry that you have to put up with that.", "NTA. \n\nHowever Skye is a name they always have to spell out. I also have a name that has the same problem. And it can be quite annoying. The sound of the name is cute though.", "NTA -Your kids, you choice of names. Your brother & SIL were completely out of line for discussing your choice of names in front of their kids. Frankly, I sort of agree with them, your choice of names will cause problems for your twins. But it is still your right to name them whatever you want.", "Oof, those are some pretty terrible names.", "ESH because everyone in the story is immature and petty\n\nYou 100% can not tell your sibling how to raise their kids.  If they want to reinforce the idea what non traditional names are immature and stupid, they can.  \n\nyou have every right to name your kids whatever you want to name them\n\nAnd they have every right to tell their kids that your kid's names are stupid\n\nThat's sort of how parenting works.  It's not good parenting, but it's their right none the less\n\nAnd yes, it is possibly and even likely that at some point, both your boys will be teased for the names they have.  Kids are cruel.  Parents are cruel too as you are just learning.  But kids especially.\n\nOne of my niblings has a kid named Aspen in their class and all the kids call him ASS and won't call him anything else.  And the teachers have to allow it because it's technically short for Aspen\n\n\nLife is not black and white.\n\nThere is no right or wrong name for your child.

You and your spouse also for those god awful names.\n\nI do agree with the point that your bro and SIL shouldn\u2019t actively try to sway their kids\u2019 opinions on the names.

I made sure to wait until the kids were out of earshot because I would never want to argue in front of them.", "They are! Even Skye has been around for a while now.

My husband has a similar style name to them and has always had a fine time with it so we feel secure enough that they won't have trouble with their names. if they want to change them when they're older we'd support that.

He has one similar in style to theirs. So while it could happen, any name could do that. My brother used to have his name made fun of when he was a kid. I had some comments as well as a kid (mostly being told my name was their grandma's name or their great grandma's name or some old lady's name). Some names do attract it more. I will admit that.

He has never had problems with his name.", "Also, Guys and Dolls came out in the 50s I think, so Skye is older than you might think too!", "I did a sneaky manoeuvre to avoid these arguments (as my dad did before me). I picked a really unusual name for my son that is very old. Yeah, it's relatively unique, but I didn't make it up in order for it to be so!", "...... Still.  This really is gonna be an issue. I honestly wished my parents gave me an easier to spell name. Not one that can be written in multiple ways. Or that is difficult when they move to a different area.", "Being an old name doesn't make the name any less terrible. Wren is also a family of bird.

I chose to use my \"weird\" first name, rather than my given name (parents always called me by my middle name) when I went to secondary school,  as there were 3 other girls with my given name already. I never got any grief over my unusual name. \n\nIf kids want to tease you and involve your name in it, it doesn't matter what that name is, they'll find a way! \n\nI know a few Wrens and a Skye. It's really not that unusual nowadays.", "Then let\u2019s hope for your kids\u2019 sake that the school bullies also disagree with me.", "Skye first became popular (as a full name, not a nickname) in 1952, but it's recorded as being a full name in 1919 social security records.\n\nWren is an old Irish and English name (sometimes Wrenna) from the Middle Ages!  Can't get much more classic than that!", "My sister's name is Alyssa and people constantly mispronounce it 15 different ways, most commonly as \"Uh-leesh-uh\".  I get asked how my very traditional 3 letter name is spelled 19/20 times (Max for example). \n\nYes, less common names can absolutely have it worse, but I think you're missing that there is an existing issue with people just doing this to almost everyone, so when it happens to you it seems like it's a huge difference instead of a minor to moderate one.", "I'm aware it's a kind of bird. As is Robin.
