If the initial fall was because of a defect, like a hole in the oavement you could sue based on that.

If he\u2019s permanently injured you could but most kids that age get hurt all the time. You can sue anyone for anything but unless there\u2019s a substantial injury no lawyer would take it on a contingency basis. \n\nDo you know how many people have threatened to sue me? Definitely more than a hundred. How many times were they successful? Zero. Because I didn\u2019t break laws. At least wait until you aren\u2019t so made before you talk to them. People tend to say things they regret when they are angry. The only person that will hurt is you from stress or having a heart attack. \n\nI once picked up my child from daycare and they didn\u2019t notice she had a fever of 103. She didn\u2019t say anything to them so I didn\u2019t blame them. They are just humans too. \n\nWith everything else going on at schools aimed at teachers and libraries we need to give them some slack. They get paid starvation wages. They have to learn what to do for shootings. They had to teach through the pandemic.  \n\nWhy make their lives even more horrible. You have a right to be a little angry. But anything beyond that, like threatening a lawsuit is ridiculous. I work with tons of attorneys and this is how I know. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your son broke his wrist. I broke my wrist once too.

The best story was when my littlest sister was starting kindergarten in 2002 and she hadn't gotten her chickenpox vaccine between she had the chickenpox as a baby in 1998. The nurse insisted that she couldn't come to school without the vaccine and my mom kept saying \"she doesn't need the vaccine when she's *had the disease!* she's immune from that!\"\n\nMy mom then asked what license the school nurse had who responded she was a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). My mom scoffs at her and said \"yeah, so you're a Let's Play Nurse. I'm an RN, you know, a Real Nurse.\" School nurse was not happy about that.", "Except in this case, the school had a duty of care. If you as an adult injure yourself on public property, you are responsible for getting yourself medical attention. In this case, it was a child who was injured and denied medical attention. You shouldn't necessarily sue the nurse or teacher, but the school is responsible for the protocols in place to get children appropriate medical care while they are in their care. You may not be able to sue for a lot of money, but you can put pressure on them to change protocols and policies.", "I have no idea why you would say except in this case they have a duty to care. It\u2019s not just this case, they all have that. \n\nThings like this always happen in life. One needs to look carefully at the pros and cons of the situation before acting. \n\nMy father was a lawyer. His father was a lawyer and my other grandfather was a judge. I have the scales of justice tattooed on my shoulder. \n\nIn the career I have, I also work with multiple lawyers. \n\nSo many people have said they would call a lawyer but it\u2019s extremely rare.

He said the exact same thing as I did only I didn\u2019t charge her. \n\nI\u2019m a property manager which means I\u2019m a constant mediator so I do speak from my area of expertise. If this was a question about plumbing or engineering I would have no idea. But I do know who to ask. \n\nWell if that\u2019s a hill she wants to die on both of them will suffer the consequences. They are human after all. She could change schools but they would ask why. \n\nBefore saying they should change their protocol, you need to see what it is. Maybe it\u2019s there and they made a mistake. But kids bounce back from so many falls as they grow. But now, just sleep wrong and your neck will hurt for a year.", "My previous comment qualified my statement with, if the doctor that eventually saw the child said that waiting caused damage or further injury, or impacted healing time you may want to contact a lawyer. I didn't say the first reaction should be to sue the school. If the school doesn't give a satisfactory response above \"oops, we forgot\", it may be worth pursuing a change in protocol, such as \"injured child gets sent to the nurse who immediately notifies the parent\" if immediate notification takes place, there is less chance of forgetting. Also, I honestly forgot that suing for medical costs was a thing, as we don't really have those here.", "honestly as someone who has worked in a school district and with children all under the age of 10, i can at least drop some information here- falls scrapes and bruises happen all the time. and when i mean all the time literally at least 3 times a day. now for the majority of those falls, scrapes, or bruises, the kids will cry and then go about their business like nothing ever happened. kids cry because they get embarrassed or because they want consoling because falling can come as a shock. my point being is that it happens so often that teachers and other staff become used to it and it isnt a big deal at the time, or doesnt seem like it is.   \n\n\nhowever, if any of my students ever so much as got a paper cut i always at least shot over an email to their parents just saying \"hey little timmy got a papercut today just wanted to let you know so you wouldnt be concerned of where it came from\" type of thing. this was mostly to save my own ass as well as the other teachers around me because there are parents that will take it to the extreme saying either we caused the injury or we werent paying attention enough to their child while simultaneously dealing with 30 other kids. BUT i still made sure to let them know. \n\ni dont think YTA, because i would be concerned about my kids health and safety first and foremost, but, just take into account that teachers and nurses see kids every day crying over something as simple as a bump, so they might've genuinely thought it was just that. i doubt it was in ill intention, or trying to hide it from you. id be upset too if it were my kid, especially with something as much as a break. im sorry that happened to you & your kiddo", "Okay some people need to chill, my guess is that they are fractures.

I was the same age when I broke my wrist during recess, we were playing kickball, I slipped, and landed on my wrist. The school *did* call my mom, because it hurt, but for some reason there was no swelling, so she was a little miffed when she took me to the doctor thinking it was nothing serious as I seemed to move my hand and wrist with ease. Her tune changed when the doc came out and said \"yup, it's broken.\" I don't blame her though, as I do have a rather high tolerance for pain, but she took it as a learning experience that if I told her something hurt, she was to take it seriously. The one thing I learned from that experience is when I write with my left hand, it is in mirror form to my right, so anything written with that hand can be read in a mirror.\n\nHere's hoping that he has a quick recovery, as casts suck...", "NTA", "NTA Dealt with something similar where my younger brother fell (was pushed) of a slide when we were younger. Broke his wrist and it ended up needing pins put in. No one called for that either.", "Nta, this is now a legal issue.

She went to the nurse and was given an ice pack.  I found out when she got home.  I didn't think anything of the school not calling.  I guess I just wouldn't expect them to call because she fell and complained of her wrist/arm hurting if they had no reason to believe it was any more than that.  \n\nAs it turns out, she was fine for four or five days and *then* mentioned it was still hurting.  That's when I took her for an x-ray and found out it was fractured in two places.  So she had no complaints for days.  If I didn't see any reason to assume there was a fracture, I don't know why the school would have.", "NTA. Kids get hurt all the time and always need icepacks and most the time those injuries don't require a call home. However if he broke his wrist, there had to be other factors to indicate something was wrong. When you break a bone and there's usually swelling and redness and possibly bruising. Even if there wasn't, he probably wasn't using it like he normally would too.\n\nWhen I was younger, my own school called home because of a suspected break since I was favoring my arm. There was absolutely no tell in terms of looks, but I had broken my collarbone. I didn't need an ice pack, no swelling, and I wasn't crying, but through observation they knew something was wrong. It sounds like your son's school just ignored all signs something was wrong and didn't want to deal with it.", "NTA. Start at the office and go up the chain. I forgot is BS.

Then discuss the actual injury and the possible issues that may have arisen and still may arise due to the delay in treatment (and use the words DELAY in TREATMENT) as well as the fact you child was sent to Gym class.   One it will allow you to vent, two it will get across the seriousness of their failure to act appropriately and three its not that easy to blow someone off in person.
