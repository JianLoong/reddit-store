If the initial fall was because of a defect, like a hole in the oavement you could sue based on that.

If he\u2019s permanently injured you could but most kids that age get hurt all the time. You can sue anyone for anything but unless there\u2019s a substantial injury no lawyer would take it on a contingency basis. \n\nDo you know how many people have threatened to sue me? Definitely more than a hundred. How many times were they successful? Zero. Because I didn\u2019t break laws. At least wait until you aren\u2019t so made before you talk to them. People tend to say things they regret when they are angry. The only person that will hurt is you from stress or having a heart attack. \n\nI once picked up my child from daycare and they didn\u2019t notice she had a fever of 103. She didn\u2019t say anything to them so I didn\u2019t blame them. They are just humans too. \n\nWith everything else going on at schools aimed at teachers and libraries we need to give them some slack. They get paid starvation wages. They have to learn what to do for shootings. They had to teach through the pandemic.  \n\nWhy make their lives even more horrible. You have a right to be a little angry. But anything beyond that, like threatening a lawsuit is ridiculous. I work with tons of attorneys and this is how I know. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your son broke his wrist. I broke my wrist once too.

The best story was when my littlest sister was starting kindergarten in 2002 and she hadn't gotten her chickenpox vaccine between she had the chickenpox as a baby in 1998. The nurse insisted that she couldn't come to school without the vaccine and my mom kept saying \"she doesn't need the vaccine when she's *had the disease!* she's immune from that!\"\n\nMy mom then asked what license the school nurse had who responded she was a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). My mom scoffs at her and said \"yeah, so you're a Let's Play Nurse. I'm an RN, you know, a Real Nurse.\" School nurse was not happy about that.", "Except in this case, the school had a duty of care. If you as an adult injure yourself on public property, you are responsible for getting yourself medical attention. In this case, it was a child who was injured and denied medical attention. You shouldn't necessarily sue the nurse or teacher, but the school is responsible for the protocols in place to get children appropriate medical care while they are in their care. You may not be able to sue for a lot of money, but you can put pressure on them to change protocols and policies.", "I have no idea why you would say except in this case they have a duty to care. It\u2019s not just this case, they all have that. \n\nThings like this always happen in life. One needs to look carefully at the pros and cons of the situation before acting. \n\nMy father was a lawyer. His father was a lawyer and my other grandfather was a judge. I have the scales of justice tattooed on my shoulder. \n\nIn the career I have, I also work with multiple lawyers. \n\nSo many people have said they would call a lawyer but it\u2019s extremely rare.

He said the exact same thing as I did only I didn\u2019t charge her. \n\nI\u2019m a property manager which means I\u2019m a constant mediator so I do speak from my area of expertise. If this was a question about plumbing or engineering I would have no idea. But I do know who to ask. \n\nWell if that\u2019s a hill she wants to die on both of them will suffer the consequences. They are human after all. She could change schools but they would ask why. \n\nBefore saying they should change their protocol, you need to see what it is. Maybe it\u2019s there and they made a mistake. But kids bounce back from so many falls as they grow. But now, just sleep wrong and your neck will hurt for a year.", "My previous comment qualified my statement with, if the doctor that eventually saw the child said that waiting caused damage or further injury, or impacted healing time you may want to contact a lawyer. I didn't say the first reaction should be to sue the school. If the school doesn't give a satisfactory response above \"oops, we forgot\", it may be worth pursuing a change in protocol, such as \"injured child gets sent to the nurse who immediately notifies the parent\" if immediate notification takes place, there is less chance of forgetting. Also, I honestly forgot that suing for medical costs was a thing, as we don't really have those here.", "honestly as someone who has worked in a school district and with children all under the age of 10, i can at least drop some information here- falls scrapes and bruises happen all the time. and when i mean all the time literally at least 3 times a day. now for the majority of those falls, scrapes, or bruises, the kids will cry and then go about their business like nothing ever happened. kids cry because they get embarrassed or because they want consoling because falling can come as a shock. my point being is that it happens so often that teachers and other staff become used to it and it isnt a big deal at the time, or doesnt seem like it is.   \n\n\nhowever, if any of my students ever so much as got a paper cut i always at least shot over an email to their parents just saying \"hey little timmy got a papercut today just wanted to let you know so you wouldnt be concerned of where it came from\" type of thing. this was mostly to save my own ass as well as the other teachers around me because there are parents that will take it to the extreme saying either we caused the injury or we werent paying attention enough to their child while simultaneously dealing with 30 other kids. BUT i still made sure to let them know. \n\ni dont think YTA, because i would be concerned about my kids health and safety first and foremost, but, just take into account that teachers and nurses see kids every day crying over something as simple as a bump, so they might've genuinely thought it was just that. i doubt it was in ill intention, or trying to hide it from you. id be upset too if it were my kid, especially with something as much as a break. im sorry that happened to you & your kiddo", "Okay some people need to chill, my guess is that they are fractures.

I was the same age when I broke my wrist during recess, we were playing kickball, I slipped, and landed on my wrist. The school *did* call my mom, because it hurt, but for some reason there was no swelling, so she was a little miffed when she took me to the doctor thinking it was nothing serious as I seemed to move my hand and wrist with ease. Her tune changed when the doc came out and said \"yup, it's broken.\" I don't blame her though, as I do have a rather high tolerance for pain, but she took it as a learning experience that if I told her something hurt, she was to take it seriously. The one thing I learned from that experience is when I write with my left hand, it is in mirror form to my right, so anything written with that hand can be read in a mirror.\n\nHere's hoping that he has a quick recovery, as casts suck...", "NTA", "NTA Dealt with something similar where my younger brother fell (was pushed) of a slide when we were younger. Broke his wrist and it ended up needing pins put in. No one called for that either.", "Nta, this is now a legal issue.

She went to the nurse and was given an ice pack.  I found out when she got home.  I didn't think anything of the school not calling.  I guess I just wouldn't expect them to call because she fell and complained of her wrist/arm hurting if they had no reason to believe it was any more than that.  \n\nAs it turns out, she was fine for four or five days and *then* mentioned it was still hurting.  That's when I took her for an x-ray and found out it was fractured in two places.  So she had no complaints for days.  If I didn't see any reason to assume there was a fracture, I don't know why the school would have.", "NTA. Kids get hurt all the time and always need icepacks and most the time those injuries don't require a call home. However if he broke his wrist, there had to be other factors to indicate something was wrong. When you break a bone and there's usually swelling and redness and possibly bruising. Even if there wasn't, he probably wasn't using it like he normally would too.\n\nWhen I was younger, my own school called home because of a suspected break since I was favoring my arm. There was absolutely no tell in terms of looks, but I had broken my collarbone. I didn't need an ice pack, no swelling, and I wasn't crying, but through observation they knew something was wrong. It sounds like your son's school just ignored all signs something was wrong and didn't want to deal with it.", "NTA. Start at the office and go up the chain. I forgot is BS.

Then discuss the actual injury and the possible issues that may have arisen and still may arise due to the delay in treatment (and use the words DELAY in TREATMENT) as well as the fact you child was sent to Gym class.   One it will allow you to vent, two it will get across the seriousness of their failure to act appropriately and three its not that easy to blow someone off in person.

A friend ran to get a teacher who upon assessing the situation accused me of trying to make excuses to stay outside for recess longer and forced me to try walking on it back to the building. Luckily I had some helpful friends there who acted as crutches to try avoid putting too much weight on it but I collapsed halfway to the building. That\u2019s when the teacher realized she made a bad call and ran for the principal.\n\nPrincipal came out with a wheel chair and immediately started trying to butter me up and talk to me about not having my parents sue. \n\nMaybe their nonchalantness is their attempt at trying to avoid a lawsuit? Acting like nothing bad happened?", "Thank you everyone for the advice and support", "NTA- that being said since this come down to the school being negligent and potentially endangering your kid, you should get a lawyer involved.", "This sounds like actionable negligence. I'd lawyer up. If they did this to your kid, who else are they neglecting? NTA", "I was the child in this scenario when I was 11 my mother pressed charges. There was an investigation and heavy fines.

A teacher ripped into the student who tripped me (it was intentional), then called my dad to have my elbow x-rayed.\n\nThat is the appropriate response. Your child actually broke their wrist in two places and needed help walking out. They should have called. NTA.", "OMG NTA. I saw a similar story online last year. Kid with broken bones just sent back to class. Man when I fell off the monkey bars and split mg chin open I\u2019m grade 2, the principal took me to the hospital HIMSELF bleeding all over in his BMW to meet my mom who was working in the city. Like how do you care so little to NOT tell a parent??", "If you're in the USA, look into lawyers who hold school districts accountable; they refused your minor son medical treatment & didn't have him properly evaluated by a proper medical professional (x-rays hello) to determine if there was any damage (sprain, strain, or break). Your son's school district should be held liable for all of his medical bills stemming from this incident.", "NTA I'd be talking to a lawyer if no one is taking you seriously. The injury could've easily become worse and if they get away this time, they'll show the same negligence next time. This school isn't a safe place for children until they're given a refresher course on their responsibilities via the school board or a judge.", "NTA. Your son was injured enough to be crying and need an ice pack. You should have been called to decide if he needed to seek medical attention or not. They violated his rights and yours.

Same thing happened to me in the 8th grade, hurt my wrist and was given an ice pack and sent on my way. \n\nMom took me to the emergency room next day and it was broken.\n\nI guess the hospital called the school, because when I went back to school the next day I got yelled at for not telling the gym teacher I was hurt.

This needs to be brought up to the school board and reported. School boards don\u2019t take things like this lightly.", "NTA. The nurse calls me every time she has contact with my daughter no matter how small", "I'm baffled they didn't call you ASAP. My kids' elementary school used to call and/or send notes over much more minor things. Seems like the kind of thing they'd *want* to call for, just in case the kid was badly injured, to avoid any possible liability or other issues.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. I'd be calling the district and advising them to update their policies. This is a major liability issue on their end.", "NTA when I was 11 I broke my wrist at school, it was hanging at a wrong angle, and they left me in the office with an ice pack for 4 hours, and told me I needed to stop crying, before bothering to call my mum.

It\u2019s basic common sense to call the parent", "NTA. Similar thing happened to me in 3rd/4th grade.

This was negligence and they're trying to make it seem like it isn't to cover their own asses. Call them out and make sure they know this cannot happen again.", "NTA, I'd be raising hell! Same thing happened to a friend of mine. Her son broke his arm at school (private Christian which is a whole other issue) and because the teacher didn't like her son (the teachers in this school were notorious for playing favorites.

They\u2019re in multiple buildings across my district. I\u2019m not surprised she forgot. If it wasn\u2019t hugely swollen and nothing obvious, I\u2019m also not surprised they gave him an ice pack and sent him back to class. Not excusing anyone, but I fully understand the reasons the nurses were on the strike lines with us teachers this past summer. They\u2019re way overworked and cannot do their job effectively (they stress this at every board meeting). I would tell the teacher and school that you\u2019d like to be notified any time a fall causes him to cry since that seemed to be a sign to you. I know 8 year olds who still cry over everything. You know your kid best so them knowing that would be helpful in the future. \n\nSo NAH for this situation. It\u2019s okay to feel upset about it, but they also triaged it at school and didn\u2019t think it was anything serious at the time. It unfortunately happens since they\u2019re not doing x-rays or anything. I would again though make sure to remind them to call in the future.", "Something similar happened to me when I was in high school. Neither the main office, nor the nurse\u2019s office told my parents the severity of my injury. In fact, they didn\u2019t follow through with the \u201cEmergency Contact Cards\u201d they made us fill out every year. \n\nLet\u2019s just say my mother handled one office while my father handled the other one. It was NOT pretty, but it was effective. The school should have done more. I\u2019m sorry your son got hurt.\n\nNTA.", "This has lawsuit plastered all over it. \nI agree with one of the commenters. \n\nSend them a strongly worded email stating you\u2019re going to consult a lawyer and will be moving forward from there", "NTA\n\nMy brother fell off a slide at age 6 and nobody was notified.

I don't expect them to have x-ray eyes but the could have picked up the phone", "I don't quite agree with that. \nYou are right about the initial injury. Falling and crying etc happens all the time. In most cases it's nothing to worry about. So if it's not obviously a severe injury and ice pack and back to the lessons if ok.\n\n BUT !!! the teacher should check on the kid after 10-15 minutes after they had time to calm down/ be distracted, and if the kid still says it hurts then the parents have to get called and they are asked to pick up the child or at least show up at the school. And that bit didn't happen! The teachers are in loco parentis at that moment and ignoring an injury then becomes medical neglect. Absolutely NTA.", "They are wrong. He broke his wrist and no one called the father. This is neglect.", "I just called and chewed them out but the nurse literally said to me \"I must have had an off day\" and I mean I get that but when kids safety is in line you should try a little harder", "Oh my god those wet paper towels from elementary school!

NTA.", "NTA it might be time to contact an attorney since they\u2019re so nonchalant about this", "NTA\n\nWhen I was 9 I also fell and broke my wrist during recess. I was a small... crack? not sure of the name in English, anyway, it was pretty minor as far as fractures go. Only visible damage on my harm was a scratch on my elbow. I cried, but not any harder than a kid who took a bad tumble, so the teachers on recess duty did not pay too much attention to that. What did make them sit up and take notice was that I had gone white as a sheet.\n\nSo they sat me down, asked me to move my fingers. Noticed I said moving my wrist hurt. Told me to keep and eye on that and after a length of time that probably was between 30 min and 2hs, when moving my wrist was still hurting **they called my mom.** Like, I'll be honest, by then, it didn't hurt at all when I kept still and even rotating my wrist only caused minor pain. But the correct amount of pain when you move a limb is zero, so better be safe than sorry, **they called my mom.**\n\nSure, your son's teachers and school nurse couldn't know he had a broken wrist, but they could tell his arm was injured, and they should have called you (and not sent him to gym, jesus christ). Even if it was only bruised, there was no harm in taking it seriously, and they could have made his injury worse.", "You\u2019re not overreacting. In the primary grades, They should have called you even for his reaction. And if it merited an ice pack, he should not have had to participate in gym of all things immediately after. Always better to be over-cautious than under-cautious. As it did end up being a break, this may warrant a complaint to the school board.", "I would probably already be talking to a lawyer, the nurse should have realized this might be serious at the least.\n\nNTA", "Your post made my blood boil. Idk what I'd do in your situation, but it would be NOT comfortable for the people at your son's school. At all.\n\nNTA. I hope everything heals fine, and he gets well soon!", "if more damage was done because it was left out of cast for so long, id guess yep (source: nothing, not a lawyer)", "Still worth looking into; with how fast laws are changing nowadays you never know, someone could open up/find a loophole to hold them accountable for their negligence.", "My daughter broke her arm at school.

I had a similar incident occur at school as a kid and my mom still regrets not suing the shit out of the school / district.

The school might not be liable for the initial injury, but if her son had sustained *additional* injury by, say, being sent to gym class with an already-broken wrist, the school district could end up liable for that. It could be considered negligence, especially if there's now a record of an official complaint and they subsequently failed to put procedures in place to ensure playground injuries are adequately assessed.\n\nIf there's anything that actually has the potential to motivate policy change, it's the fear of legal liability.
