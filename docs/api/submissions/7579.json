I ended up going to my teacher and waving my hand so that everyone could see that my finger was flopping around before they actually called (this was after they lied and told me they\u2019d called my mom two times already). I went back to school for 20 minutes after going to the doctor because I wanted to make sure they saw the cast and know that they\u2019d ignored a 8 year old who was injured. \n\nAs a parent, I think you are right to be upset and inquire as to what policy actually says should have happened vs what did.", "That's pretty much what I thought they are acting like I'm the jerk over this I just wanted some outside perspective.

He was in their custody, and he sustained an injury they recognized to require at least an ice pack to reduce the swelling in his wrist, presumably after falling on his hand. No rational adult in charge would see that and think \u201cMyeh, wrists never get seriously injured right? Let\u2019s slap an ice pack on it, send him off, ignore the complaints and don\u2019t monitor the swelling or level of pain any further\u201d but that\u2019s what they did.

In fact, I\u2019d be taking this straight up the chain. They\u2019re downplaying this because they know damn well they could be held legally liable for their negligence, so don\u2019t let them make you question whether or not you\u2019re wrong to be mad that they grossly mishandled the injury. They are not the highest authority here, and you and their superiors deserve a lot more to say on this.", "Who cares if they complain and treat you like an AH. Take this to the school board. One thing to note though, school nurses are absolutely useless. My son complained of a sprained ankle once (wasn\u2019t hurt, I knew he wasn\u2019t hurt, he didn\u2019t want to participate in PE) and the nurse couldn\u2019t even look at his ankle to see if it was swollen or bruised. It wasn\u2019t her job apparently. Regardless, you\u2019re not the AH for being upset, but you should be the AH towards the school faculty at the moment.", "If you can, an attorney could tell you. This feels like you might have an argument for negligence, here.", "I fell and hit my head walking up to my school building once and they asked a bunch of questions about where *exactly* I fell, presumably because if it was on the school grounds they could be held responsible", "Depending on what the doctor says and how long the child was left in pain without proper treatment, yes.", "You could try on two separate theories. If the initial fall was because of a defect, like a hole in the oavement you could sue based on that. Otherwise you could sue of their failure to get him prompt medical attention led to additional damage. That one would be a real longshot though considering wrist fractures are often difficult to differntiate from a bad sprain without imaging.", "No because you didn\u2019t suffer any loss of wages. If he\u2019s permanently injured you could but most kids that age get hurt all the time. You can sue anyone for anything but unless there\u2019s a substantial injury no lawyer would take it on a contingency basis. \n\nDo you know how many people have threatened to sue me? Definitely more than a hundred. How many times were they successful? Zero. Because I didn\u2019t break laws. At least wait until you aren\u2019t so made before you talk to them. People tend to say things they regret when they are angry. The only person that will hurt is you from stress or having a heart attack. \n\nI once picked up my child from daycare and they didn\u2019t notice she had a fever of 103. She didn\u2019t say anything to them so I didn\u2019t blame them. They are just humans too. \n\nWith everything else going on at schools aimed at teachers and libraries we need to give them some slack. They get paid starvation wages. They have to learn what to do for shootings. They had to teach through the pandemic.  \n\nWhy make their lives even more horrible. You have a right to be a little angry. But anything beyond that, like threatening a lawsuit is ridiculous. I work with tons of attorneys and this is how I know. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your son broke his wrist. I broke my wrist once too. I went to the ER and got a cast and went straight back to work. I didn\u2019t stay home.", "Our local TV news LOVES stories like this - maybe contact yours? They all seem to have these news segments like \"Channel 2 works for you!\"", "Good advice. I called the superintendent but all I got was more of the same. The most I got was a half a**** apology and said they would call next time. I get the feeling they don't take this seriously", "My mom is an RN and absolutely hated dealing with school nurses while my sisters and I were growing up. The best story was when my littlest sister was starting kindergarten in 2002 and she hadn't gotten her chickenpox vaccine between she had the chickenpox as a baby in 1998. The nurse insisted that she couldn't come to school without the vaccine and my mom kept saying \"she doesn't need the vaccine when she's *had the disease!* she's immune from that!\"\n\nMy mom then asked what license the school nurse had who responded she was a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). My mom scoffs at her and said \"yeah, so you're a Let's Play Nurse. I'm an RN, you know, a Real Nurse.\" School nurse was not happy about that.", "Except in this case, the school had a duty of care. If you as an adult injure yourself on public property, you are responsible for getting yourself medical attention. In this case, it was a child who was injured and denied medical attention. You shouldn't necessarily sue the nurse or teacher, but the school is responsible for the protocols in place to get children appropriate medical care while they are in their care. You may not be able to sue for a lot of money, but you can put pressure on them to change protocols and policies.", "I have no idea why you would say except in this case they have a duty to care. It\u2019s not just this case, they all have that. \n\nThings like this always happen in life. One needs to look carefully at the pros and cons of the situation before acting. \n\nMy father was a lawyer. His father was a lawyer and my other grandfather was a judge. I have the scales of justice tattooed on my shoulder. \n\nIn the career I have, I also work with multiple lawyers. \n\nSo many people have said they would call a lawyer but it\u2019s extremely rare. A lawyer should always be the last resort not the first resort. Doing it immediately just makes it seem they are after money. \n\nI have a friend who last week paid a lawyer $50 for advice. He said the exact same thing as I did only I didn\u2019t charge her. \n\nI\u2019m a property manager which means I\u2019m a constant mediator so I do speak from my area of expertise. If this was a question about plumbing or engineering I would have no idea. But I do know who to ask. \n\nWell if that\u2019s a hill she wants to die on both of them will suffer the consequences. They are human after all. She could change schools but they would ask why. \n\nBefore saying they should change their protocol, you need to see what it is. Maybe it\u2019s there and they made a mistake. But kids bounce back from so many falls as they grow. But now, just sleep wrong and your neck will hurt for a year.", "My previous comment qualified my statement with, if the doctor that eventually saw the child said that waiting caused damage or further injury, or impacted healing time you may want to contact a lawyer. I didn't say the first reaction should be to sue the school. If the school doesn't give a satisfactory response above \"oops, we forgot\", it may be worth pursuing a change in protocol, such as \"injured child gets sent to the nurse who immediately notifies the parent\" if immediate notification takes place, there is less chance of forgetting. Also, I honestly forgot that suing for medical costs was a thing, as we don't really have those here.", "honestly as someone who has worked in a school district and with children all under the age of 10, i can at least drop some information here- falls scrapes and bruises happen all the time. and when i mean all the time literally at least 3 times a day. now for the majority of those falls, scrapes, or bruises, the kids will cry and then go about their business like nothing ever happened. kids cry because they get embarrassed or because they want consoling because falling can come as a shock. my point being is that it happens so often that teachers and other staff become used to it and it isnt a big deal at the time, or doesnt seem like it is.   \n\n\nhowever, if any of my students ever so much as got a paper cut i always at least shot over an email to their parents just saying \"hey little timmy got a papercut today just wanted to let you know so you wouldnt be concerned of where it came from\" type of thing. this was mostly to save my own ass as well as the other teachers around me because there are parents that will take it to the extreme saying either we caused the injury or we werent paying attention enough to their child while simultaneously dealing with 30 other kids. BUT i still made sure to let them know. \n\ni dont think YTA, because i would be concerned about my kids health and safety first and foremost, but, just take into account that teachers and nurses see kids every day crying over something as simple as a bump, so they might've genuinely thought it was just that. i doubt it was in ill intention, or trying to hide it from you. id be upset too if it were my kid, especially with something as much as a break. im sorry that happened to you & your kiddo", "Okay some people need to chill, my guess is that they are fractures. I doubt my mans wrist was crooked.\n\nWhen I was 15 or 16 I was running on concrete at the end of P.E. when someone intentionally stuck their foot out to trip and I fell on an outstretched wrist.\n\nIt hurt like a bitch, I didn't realize it was broken until that weekend when my grip strength was unusually weak and I went to get it xray'ed and realized. (But I was using a mouse and finished the day of school fine enough before I realized I can't pick up a bottle)\n\nMaybe they should have called you. He fell and cried.  But the reality is kids fall and cry all the time, and if they called you every single time your son was upset you probably also wouldn't appreciate getting 30 false positives a year at work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are mad, and their may have been negligence (ie it's probably policy to always call the parent when they go to the nurse) on the behalf of the school, but where was the harm done?", "NTA. It does not matter if it looks insignificant to them. They should have called and let you take him to the doctors. He was crying. He could have made his injury worse by continuing school and even gym. Truely NTA.", "NTA- Same thing happened to my brother when we were growing up.  The school is in the wrong and they shouldn't be taking these things lightly", "Unless you took him right to the doctor after you saw him, sounds like you didn't think it was a big deal either.", "NTA. Light 'em up. Even if it doesn't change anything for your situation you can make them pay attention next time.\n\nMy youngest had a wrist injury at school that his doctor said could have affected further growth of a bone in his arm. That sort of thing absolutely must be brought to a parent's attention.", "NTA", "So much NTA.\n\nWhen I was 18 we were playing a game in P.E. and I stepped on a ball and ran/fell inti the mat on the wall then to the floor. The nurse was brought to me and my dad was called immediately to come get me. I ended up having a broken arm which wasn't obvious in any way other than it hurt. Again I was 18 and a senior and high school and the first thing they did was call my dad.", "Nta !!!!!! Regardless if she thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal or not you should have been contacted and given the option to take your son out I would call the principal and schedule a meeting because this shit is not OK", "NTA!

This is BS", "Make SURE you get an accident report filled out.  They have to pay for this.  Document this so you don't get screwed over.", "Totally NTA, as the school should call you any time a child has an injury like that. I was the same age when I broke my wrist during recess, we were playing kickball, I slipped, and landed on my wrist. The school *did* call my mom, because it hurt, but for some reason there was no swelling, so she was a little miffed when she took me to the doctor thinking it was nothing serious as I seemed to move my hand and wrist with ease. Her tune changed when the doc came out and said \"yup, it's broken.\" I don't blame her though, as I do have a rather high tolerance for pain, but she took it as a learning experience that if I told her something hurt, she was to take it seriously. The one thing I learned from that experience is when I write with my left hand, it is in mirror form to my right, so anything written with that hand can be read in a mirror.\n\nHere's hoping that he has a quick recovery, as casts suck...", "NTA", "NTA Dealt with something similar where my younger brother fell (was pushed) of a slide when we were younger. Broke his wrist and it ended up needing pins put in. No one called for that either.", "Nta, this is now a legal issue. They neglected your child's health and are acting like it was a simple sliver your son had to deal with. This is not okay. It needs to be reported and they need to be held accountable. Did you call the school board or the superintendent?", "NAH.  My daughter fell and broke her wrist at school when she was in kindergarten.  (They didn't know it was broken either.)  She went to the nurse and was given an ice pack.  I found out when she got home.  I didn't think anything of the school not calling.  I guess I just wouldn't expect them to call because she fell and complained of her wrist/arm hurting if they had no reason to believe it was any more than that.  \n\nAs it turns out, she was fine for four or five days and *then* mentioned it was still hurting.  That's when I took her for an x-ray and found out it was fractured in two places.  So she had no complaints for days.  If I didn't see any reason to assume there was a fracture, I don't know why the school would have.", "NTA. Kids get hurt all the time and always need icepacks and most the time those injuries don't require a call home. However if he broke his wrist, there had to be other factors to indicate something was wrong. When you break a bone and there's usually swelling and redness and possibly bruising. Even if there wasn't, he probably wasn't using it like he normally would too.\n\nWhen I was younger, my own school called home because of a suspected break since I was favoring my arm. There was absolutely no tell in terms of looks, but I had broken my collarbone. I didn't need an ice pack, no swelling, and I wasn't crying, but through observation they knew something was wrong. It sounds like your son's school just ignored all signs something was wrong and didn't want to deal with it.", "NTA. Start at the office and go up the chain. I forgot is BS. To many kids get hurt worse. Parents find out too late.", "ABSOLUTELY NOT THE A HOLE  same exact thing happened to my son when he was in 2nd so he was 6 about to turn 7 & when my baby got home he was in so much pain his hand was bigger then mine he didn\u2019t even make it in the house i  took him immediately to the e.r where they said his hand had a fracture and wrist sprained they put a cast on him all the way up to his elbow !

No swelling, etc.  Just FYI", "Child abuse?  Yikes.", "Send a request in  writing to the principal and superintendent, so you have a trail,  for a copy of their written policy on how to handle injuries that occur in school ( you may have a copy, sometimes its in the student handbook).  You will need to follow up.  If they fail to provide one, send a request to the school board and attend the next meeting and request it again on the record, when they ask about new business (make sure you follow any procedures to get on the agenda if necessary) Once you review it, point out, again in writing, where the failed to follow procedures (copying your child's teacher, the recess monitor, the gym teacher, the nurse, the principal, the superintendent and  the school board (there should be a general email, if not send to the secretary and president)) and request an in person meeting with the principal, school nurse and recess monitor to discuss exactly what happened, how your child was treated at each stage, why the polices were not followed, what has been done to ensure that policies were not ignored in the future.  Then discuss the actual injury and the possible issues that may have arisen and still may arise due to the delay in treatment (and use the words DELAY in TREATMENT) as well as the fact you child was sent to Gym class.   One it will allow you to vent, two it will get across the seriousness of their failure to act appropriately and three its not that easy to blow someone off in person.  FYI - don't bother asking about the consequences for the people who failed to act, by law they cannot disclose it.
