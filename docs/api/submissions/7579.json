OP can take it up with the school principal or with the head of the school district.  I am not sure what good it will do as they will probably just give OP some lip service and basically, deny any cupability here.", "NTA", "NTA happened to me a as a kid. I ended up going to my teacher and waving my hand so that everyone could see that my finger was flopping around before they actually called (this was after they lied and told me they\u2019d called my mom two times already). I went back to school for 20 minutes after going to the doctor because I wanted to make sure they saw the cast and know that they\u2019d ignored a 8 year old who was injured. \n\nAs a parent, I think you are right to be upset and inquire as to what policy actually says should have happened vs what did.", "That's pretty much what I thought they are acting like I'm the jerk over this I just wanted some outside perspective. Sometimes anger clouds the judgement.", "Oh I am so pi**** but it's like what do I do other than chew them out and formally complain. Then they treat me like a AH for complaining", "I am not a fan of getting lawyers because they are often unjustified but certainly not in this case. Get a lawyer ASAP. The school\u2019s actions or lack of actions was unacceptable and hurt their child.", "Is that even something you could sue for?", "Good to know thanks", "I guess it's not just me then", "Thanks!", "Yep that's pretty much what happened", "No no. He was in their custody, and he sustained an injury they recognized to require at least an ice pack to reduce the swelling in his wrist, presumably after falling on his hand. No rational adult in charge would see that and think \u201cMyeh, wrists never get seriously injured right? Let\u2019s slap an ice pack on it, send him off, ignore the complaints and don\u2019t monitor the swelling or level of pain any further\u201d but that\u2019s what they did. If you knew something was off enough to require a trip to the clinic, they should have known it was off enough to call you. \n\nNTA. If I were you I\u2019d be livid. In fact, I\u2019d be taking this straight up the chain. They\u2019re downplaying this because they know damn well they could be held legally liable for their negligence, so don\u2019t let them make you question whether or not you\u2019re wrong to be mad that they grossly mishandled the injury. They are not the highest authority here, and you and their superiors deserve a lot more to say on this.", "Who cares if they complain and treat you like an AH. Take this to the school board. One thing to note though, school nurses are absolutely useless. My son complained of a sprained ankle once (wasn\u2019t hurt, I knew he wasn\u2019t hurt, he didn\u2019t want to participate in PE) and the nurse couldn\u2019t even look at his ankle to see if it was swollen or bruised. It wasn\u2019t her job apparently. Regardless, you\u2019re not the AH for being upset, but you should be the AH towards the school faculty at the moment.", "If you can, an attorney could tell you. This feels like you might have an argument for negligence, here.", "I fell and hit my head walking up to my school building once and they asked a bunch of questions about where *exactly* I fell, presumably because if it was on the school grounds they could be held responsible", "Depending on what the doctor says and how long the child was left in pain without proper treatment, yes.", "You could try on two separate theories. If the initial fall was because of a defect, like a hole in the oavement you could sue based on that. Otherwise you could sue of their failure to get him prompt medical attention led to additional damage. That one would be a real longshot though considering wrist fractures are often difficult to differntiate from a bad sprain without imaging.", "No because you didn\u2019t suffer any loss of wages. If he\u2019s permanently injured you could but most kids that age get hurt all the time. You can sue anyone for anything but unless there\u2019s a substantial injury no lawyer would take it on a contingency basis. \n\nDo you know how many people have threatened to sue me? Definitely more than a hundred. How many times were they successful? Zero. Because I didn\u2019t break laws. At least wait until you aren\u2019t so made before you talk to them. People tend to say things they regret when they are angry. The only person that will hurt is you from stress or having a heart attack. \n\nI once picked up my child from daycare and they didn\u2019t notice she had a fever of 103. She didn\u2019t say anything to them so I didn\u2019t blame them. They are just humans too. \n\nWith everything else going on at schools aimed at teachers and libraries we need to give them some slack. They get paid starvation wages. They have to learn what to do for shootings. They had to teach through the pandemic.  \n\nWhy make their lives even more horrible. You have a right to be a little angry. But anything beyond that, like threatening a lawsuit is ridiculous. I work with tons of attorneys and this is how I know. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your son broke his wrist. I broke my wrist once too. I went to the ER and got a cast and went straight back to work. I didn\u2019t stay home.", "Our local TV news LOVES stories like this - maybe contact yours? They all seem to have these news segments like \"Channel 2 works for you!\"", "Good advice. I called the superintendent but all I got was more of the same. The most I got was a half a**** apology and said they would call next time. I get the feeling they don't take this seriously", "My mom is an RN and absolutely hated dealing with school nurses while my sisters and I were growing up. The best story was when my littlest sister was starting kindergarten in 2002 and she hadn't gotten her chickenpox vaccine between she had the chickenpox as a baby in 1998. The nurse insisted that she couldn't come to school without the vaccine and my mom kept saying \"she doesn't need the vaccine when she's *had the disease!* she's immune from that!\"\n\nMy mom then asked what license the school nurse had who responded she was a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN). My mom scoffs at her and said \"yeah, so you're a Let's Play Nurse. I'm an RN, you know, a Real Nurse.\" School nurse was not happy about that.", "Except in this case, the school had a duty of care. If you as an adult injure yourself on public property, you are responsible for getting yourself medical attention. In this case, it was a child who was injured and denied medical attention. You shouldn't necessarily sue the nurse or teacher, but the school is responsible for the protocols in place to get children appropriate medical care while they are in their care. You may not be able to sue for a lot of money, but you can put pressure on them to change protocols and policies.", "I have no idea why you would say except in this case they have a duty to care. It\u2019s not just this case, they all have that. \n\nThings like this always happen in life. One needs to look carefully at the pros and cons of the situation before acting. \n\nMy father was a lawyer. His father was a lawyer and my other grandfather was a judge. I have the scales of justice tattooed on my shoulder. \n\nIn the career I have, I also work with multiple lawyers. \n\nSo many people have said they would call a lawyer but it\u2019s extremely rare. A lawyer should always be the last resort not the first resort. Doing it immediately just makes it seem they are after money. \n\nI have a friend who last week paid a lawyer $50 for advice. He said the exact same thing as I did only I didn\u2019t charge her. \n\nI\u2019m a property manager which means I\u2019m a constant mediator so I do speak from my area of expertise. If this was a question about plumbing or engineering I would have no idea. But I do know who to ask. \n\nWell if that\u2019s a hill she wants to die on both of them will suffer the consequences. They are human after all. She could change schools but they would ask why. \n\nBefore saying they should change their protocol, you need to see what it is. Maybe it\u2019s there and they made a mistake. But kids bounce back from so many falls as they grow. But now, just sleep wrong and your neck will hurt for a year.", "My previous comment qualified my statement with, if the doctor that eventually saw the child said that waiting caused damage or further injury, or impacted healing time you may want to contact a lawyer. I didn't say the first reaction should be to sue the school. If the school doesn't give a satisfactory response above \"oops, we forgot\", it may be worth pursuing a change in protocol, such as \"injured child gets sent to the nurse who immediately notifies the parent\" if immediate notification takes place, there is less chance of forgetting. Also, I honestly forgot that suing for medical costs was a thing, as we don't really have those here."]}
