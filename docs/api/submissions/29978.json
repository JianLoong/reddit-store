{"id": 29978, "submission_id": "17jvxx1", "title": "AITA for postponing my vacation with my gf because of my ex?", "selftext": "My ex wife and I divorced 6 years ago. We married really young, she is very religious and there was pressure from her family to marry. I was young and dumb and had just left the military with no sense of direction. We were very different people but it didn\u2019t come out as we only dated for 8 month before marrying. It felt very romantic to marry after such a short time but after we wed and moved in together it was clear we weren\u2019t a good match. We stuck it out for 8 years but it wasn\u2019t working and we were both older so the whole thing with living miserably to make other people happy (her and my parents) didn\u2019t appeal anymore. I don\u2019t blame her for any of it, I think we just didn\u2019t understand what we wanted at the time and did things to please other people. We had an amicable divorce and our son lived with her until high school. He is with me for high school because we live near a top school and she lives in a small town without a good high school. He is suppose to stay summers and holidays with her and come here to during the school year. \n\nMy ex wife got diagnosed with cervial cancer last month and it was caught late so it\u2019s already spread. The long term survival rates isn\u2019t great and I want my son to visit his mother in a week or 2 before she goes though her hysterectomy. My vacation renews every June 30th. I had saved 2 weeks to go to Hawaii this winter break. However with this situation I want to take a week or 2 to go with my son to be there for him. His mom won\u2019t be able to cook and clean for him and he also wants for me to drive them up to the next city to visit his grandparents. The other issue is my son might have to stay with us for this winter break (he is suppose to go to his mom\u2019s but it\u2019s unlikely now depending on her treatment schedule) and I don\u2019t want to go on vacation with him home alone with this happening. \n\nMy gf is not happy because we have winter break set up to go to Hawaii and our flights have been booked. I called the airline and they said they would switch our flights to a later one for $600 which I offered to cover so we could rebook the vacation for next fall instead. But she thinks my son should be able to go back alone and thinks I\u2019m wasting my vacation going with him when we already have plans. My son does go on flights by himself (he is almost 16) however this time my ex isn\u2019t going to be physically be able to take care of our son. There are also a lot of things to be done in prep for my son and my ex before she goes through chemo and surgery. My gf is upset I\u2019m prioritizing my ex over her but I see it as going because my son might lose his mom.

My mother died of cancer when I was 13, and was diagnosed while I was spending the summer with my dad and his girlfriend (now wife). When we got the news my dad made the plans to immediately drive me from CO to OH and stayed there with me until she passed, even though my step-dad, grandparents, and countless aunts and uncles were there too. Never once was my dad's GF anything but supportive of him being there with me while I was going through the hardest thing in my life. If she had, I can promise you neither of us would have ever had anything to do with her again. And we would have been 100% correct in that stance. Please hear me when I tell you, your son in the ONLY thing that matters right now, and if your GF can't see that, she is not the one.", "Oh wow your current girlfriend is cold and heartless. \n\nNTA\n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by your son. He\u2019s going to experience tragedy and your girlfriend is more concerned about her vacation plans.", "NTA, not even remotely. Yes, he\u2019s old enough to feed himself, so his own laundry, and travel by himself, but this is a huge visit and he needs your emotional support, as well as help with the basics and to go see his grandparents. I get that your gf is super excited about Hawaii in the winter, but this is a huge moment for your son and he needs to come first. If she can\u2019t understand that\u2026 well, only you know what needs to be considered.", "Your son will still need support though, just as he would need it if you had been diagnosed with such a grave illness.\n\nNTA. Never let someone tell you what your relationship with your child should look like on THEIR terms. This is a sad and frightening time in both your child's and your ex's lives. Standing behind our children when life feels chaotic and uncertain is just what we have to do sometimes. Real dads do prioritize their children's needs as the needs arise.\n\nYour GF isn't feeling your son's feelings and so she shouldn't make decisions for him. She's not his parent. (Your son likely can learn to cook some simple meals for himself and he can certainly do his own laundry at 16. But the nuts and bolts of his life aren't the great issues he faces right now. His mom is terribly ill and he just needs you to be there for him so he doesn't feel isolated and alone.)", "NTA. Your gf is jealous of what might be a dying woman. I cannot imagine being so insecure that I pout over my partner wanting to be there for his child during such a difficult time. I\u2019d be proud to be dating someone so caring and compassionate. You really need to ask yourself if this woman is really who you want to be with, especially since you have a son to think about. You want to date someone who\u2019s this callous to your kid??\n\n(Also, make sure your son\u2019s mother is okay with this plan you\u2019ve come up with.)", "NTA\n\nYour son is probably old enough to go on the flight and manage caring for himself.\n\nBUT he won\u2019t be able to emotionally care for himself during this time. You are doing the right thing by supporting your son.", "NTA\n\nYou are correct. You aren't prioritizing your ex. You are prioritizing you son who may be about to lose his mother.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re prioritizing your *son* over your girlfriend, which you should. \n\nYour girlfriend just sounds cold and like one of those women who is expecting your son to move out at 18 and that the both of you will then pretend like he doesn\u2019t exist.", "NTA and your gf is selfish and inconsiderate.", "NTA \n\nYour son needs you at this time. \n\nI wonder, does your girlfriend have children? If not, then it\u2019s possible that she just doesn\u2019t realise that once you have kids with someone you are bound to them forever simply by being co-parents, even if you go your separate ways in life. She will have to accept this but best to be gentle as she probably feels a bit insecure about it.", "NTA. The mother of your child has cancer that has spread. I think you're doing the right thing by going with him! Your gf is being really selfish.\n\nINFO: What does your son think? Does he want you to come with him? (I'm sure he does)", "This is a pivotal moment in your relationship with your girlfriend and how your gf views your child. \n\nYour son needs YOU at what is going to be one of the most difficult things he will ever go through. At 16 his hormones and thoughts are all over the place as it it, throw this situation in the mix and he\u2019ll need you more than ever, and he\u2019ll remember you for being there when he needed you, not off in Hawaii with some long forgotten ex girlfriend. \n\nYour girlfriend\u2019s thought process is \u201cme, me, me\u201d even though you\u2019ve offered to compromise. \n\nFor me, dating someone without empathy for you, your son or your ex, in this specific situation, would be an a huge concern going forward.\n\nNTA, and sorry for what you\u2019re all going through.", "NTA and if your GF cant understand why supporting your son while his mother battles what is likely now a terminal cancer diagnosis is and should be your priority, then maybe she shouldn't be your GF?", "NTA. You are taking care of your son--he's your first priority. Gf needs to grow up and realize that. Keep a sharp eye out in case she tries to take it out on your son.", "A father shouldn't date a woman who treats his son this way. NTA - so fix that", "NTA.  But your gf certainly is.", "NTA. You are putting your child first.", "NTA- you may consider if your gf is a good partner for the future she sounds extremely self involved", "NTA. Obviously, you need to prioritize your child over your GF. If she does not like it, then that would be something to consider going forward with her. If she keeps pushing this, she is an AH.", "NTA !! \n\nYou should not feel guilty about thinking of the wellbeing of your son.\n\nI would drop this current GF from your Life, who thinks your son is a liability, this could save a lot of future heartaches. She seems really stone-hearted and cruel and selfish, Take care !!", "NTA Your prioritizing your son, as you SHOULD do.\n\nPoor kid might lose his mother and needs you. Your gf sound immature and insecure, and she will forever rank lower than your minor son.", "NTA. Having a parent with cancer is horrible at any age, but worse still as a kid. It's important that you be there for him and if the gf can't understand that she may not be the right fit for your family.", "Prioritize your son. The end. NTA", "NTA, I\u2019d be single. You have a big heart, kudos.", "my guy his 16 and in bad place you need a new girlfriend, thats your son, your legacy right there and he needs you", "NTA your son needs you know more than ever and please take the way your GF acts at face value. She doesn't care that your son might lose his mother. All she sees is  not going to Hawaii. \n\nI would rethink this relationship a lot based on her behaviour.", "NTA You are prioritizing your son whose mother is dying, not your ex. Your gf wants you to prioritize a vacation. I\u2019d be reevaluating the entire relationship & watch very closely how she is treating your son. I\u2019m guessing she has no children and is much younger than you.", "NTA. You are prioritising your son which is exactly what you should do as a father. The lack of empathy from your GF is unbelievable.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is heartless, jealous and immature. Your son comes first. ALWAYS", " NTA \n\nYou\u2019re supporting your son with the eminent passing of his mom. Your ex obviously didn\u2019t try to sabotage your vacation by choice. Your gf needs to understand that difference.", "NTA\n\nYou need to take a hard look at your relationship. If this is how your GF is reacting to a situation involving someone with advanced cancer versus her vacation, your son is likely to have a difficult time in his last few years of high school if your ex\u2019s health and how that affects your son takes away more of your attention from your GF.", "NTA. It's a bummer to postpone a vacation you're looking forward to, but considering the situation, your gf should keep her disappointment to herself or vent to someone else about it. \n\nAs it stands, she's showing a staggering lack of empathy for you, your son, and your son's mother, and I would take it as the red flag it is. \n\nTeenagers and young adults still need their parents. His mom is dying and she wants you to send him off alone and abandon him. As someone whose mom died in my early 20s, who felt alone and scared and tired and angry much of the time leading up to it, I am disgusted by your gf.\n\nETA: your son will be grieving after this. It's not a one and done thing. How is your gf going to deal with that? Is she going to tell him to get over it already? Is she going to be mad when you're worried about him or have to cancel plans if he's having a particularly difficult day? Are you allowed to attend the funeral if it's out of town?", "NTA. My dad had cancer at your kids age and I had 0 parental support, your decision to stay home with him while his literal mother dies is the best one you could make.", "Your 15 year old son just found out his mother is severely ill and might be dying. He needs to be with her, and he needs YOU as well. \n\nYour child should be a priority over a damn vacation any day of the year. \n\nIf your gf doesn't understand that, she's not the right person for you. \n\nYou're a father, and your son is going through something incredibly difficult.\n\nNTA but if you don't prioritise him in this time, you would be.", "You are prioritising your son over your girlfriend - and rightly so. If your girlfriend isnt ok with that under these circumstances - I find it hard to believe she ever will be.", "NTA\u2026. And you\u2019re not prioritizing your ex. Your prioritizing your SON. \nIf your gf is not okay with you putting your CHILD first? Kick her to the curb.", "NTA but serious red flags with respect to your girlfriend\u2019s attitude to your son. This is everything you want a dad to do\u2026step up, be there in tough times\u2026and you\u2019re doing it right! Hawaii will be there next fall\u2026but will your gf ?", "NTA. Your girlfriend is selfish and clearly doesn't care about your son. You are doing the right thing.", "NTAH. This is a sad situation. You need to be there for you son and your GF is being selfish. He could lose his Mom and you are doing the right thing for him.", "NTA. It's cancer for fuck sakes. It's a big deal for your ex and your son. Your girlfriend needs to show some compassion and consider what your son is going through right now.", "NTA, you're not postponing for your ex, you're postponing your son who really needs you right now.  I have two teenage sons with my ex and if I was in your situation, I wouldn't hesitate to postpone.  It's really too bad your GF can't see it that way.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re not prioritizing your ex over her. You\u2019re prioritizing your SON over everyone and everything. As you should. \n\nYour son needs you. He needs your emotional and physical support. He needs to see he\u2019s not alone and the only way he\u2019s going to get through the hard moments is by knowing you are there in person and having you be his pillar of support. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about your ex. If your son wasn\u2019t in the picture would you be going? I doubt it unless you had that kind of close relationship. \n\nI would be questioning my future with the girlfriend if she can\u2019t see that Hawaii can wait but your son\u2019s needs during this time cannot.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re not prioritizing your ex over her, you are prioritizing your son over her. As you should be.", "NTA. You\u2019re not postponing for your ex - you\u2019re postponing for your son who would otherwise be alone and not being cared for while his mother is recovering from a scary major surgery. \n\nYou\u2019re being a good dad. I\u2019m sorry your gf doesn\u2019t see it that way. Your son has to come first.", "NTA\n\nI would be reconsidering if I want to be in a relationship with a woman who has this kind of reaction to her BF's son wanting to see his incredibly ill mother, and have his father there for support. Her precious holiday is NOT as important as your son seeing his mother, and it's mot as important as you being there for your son. He might lose his mother. He needs you. Your GF ain't it.", "NTA. I think your GF needs to take a long look at herself and let what she is saying sink in. You have your son to think about and just because you aren\u2019t married anymore, doesn\u2019t mean you stopped caring about your ex. I hope she pulls thru, but if the worst happens, imagine how you will all feel if she doesn\u2019t make it and you left to go to Hawaii?", "NTA. You aren\u2019t prioritizing your ex, you are prioritizing your son. He is capable of going on his own but he probably needs emotional support right now.", "NTA - You're prioritizing your son, not your ex.  If she can't understand that she's the AH.", "Nta you seem like a real man actually. The hell with the gf. You got your priorities right, don\u2019t let her make you think otherwise\u2026 gf is an ah", "Ywbta if you stayed with such a selfish and cold hearted woman", "NTA. You\u2019re not postponing because your ex wants to change custody to be mean, you\u2019re postponing because your child might lose a parent!

All else is noise.", "NTA. Good luck to your ex & son. Gf seems very insensitive, you are doing the right thing. Sending well wishes!", "NTA. It\u2019s not postponing because of your ex. It\u2019s postponing to support your son in a very scary, hard, stressful time. Your son\u2019s mom has cancer, and it\u2019s not clear how long she will live. Setting aside any differences with his mom, and being there for him while he spends time with her, is incredibly important and a big gift for him.

But explore all options!", "NTA Your son needs you more right now than your selfish girlfriend needs a vacation.", "NTA - it\u2019s sad that your gf is only thinking of the vacation instead of what your son is going through. That is very selfish to f her.\n\nYour son is going to need support during this. Even though it\u2019s your ex, you did love and care for her at some point.

You aren't prioritizing your ex, you are prioritizing your son at a crucial time in his life.\n\nYour GF is being selfish and unnecessarily jealous.  Hawaii will be there next year.\n\nEDIT to add:  I can't imagine enjoying a vacation in Hawaii while I knew my son was struggling with the potential loss of his mother.", "Making sure your son has support is the most important thing right now.

I think you\u2019re awesome! This is true co parenting. Given the circumstances, your son needs you there too. You share a child together and being there for her is the right thing to do. your girlfriend sounds a little jealous and you should wonder how she feels about your son. This is the time to support him. Instead of offering support she\u2019s nagging about vacation.", "NTA.\n\nPlease be there for your son. He deserves all the support he can get, no matter his age.\n\nYou can postpone a vacation but you can't turn back time to support your son if you go through with the holiday.\n \nThat'd personally make me reconsider a relationship with a partner who doesn't realize how hard this is going to be, on your son and on yourself.", "NTA you are doing the right thing!!!!! The one that's unreasonable is the gf,  and to tell you, it is even ok to have feelings about what's happening to your ex and be there to support her while caring for your child. \n\nIt kinda tells me alot about your Gf prioritising a vacation over all that is happening. Your ex is the mother of your child! you are allowed to be there for your child emotional needs.

No reasonable adult would be unhappy. Disappointed, maybe, but they wouldn\u2019t dare voice it.\n\nThe only correct response to this situation is, \u201cI understand and I am here for you to support you and your son during this difficult time.\u201d", "NTA.

I'm sorry you and your son are in this situation. \n\nIf his mother doesn't make it, and this seems likely at this point, your son is really going to need a lot of emotional support.

Clearly.", "NTA- GF is showing her true colors. I'd rethink think relationship. She's showing no compassion for your son, no compassion for the dying woman,  no compassion for this situation.

We married really young, she is very religious and there was pressure from her family to marry young. I was young and dumb and had just left the military with no sense of direction. We were very different people but it didn\u2019t come out as we only dated for 8 month before marrying. It felt very romantic to marry after such a short time but when we wed and moved in together it was clear we weren\u2019t a good match. We stuck it out for 8 years but it wasn\u2019t working and we were both older so the whole thing with living miserably to make other people happy (her and my parents) didn\u2019t appeal anymore. I don\u2019t blame her for any of it, I think we just didn\u2019t understand what we wanted at the time and did things to please other people. We had an amicable divorce and our son lived with her until high school. He is with me for high school because we live near a top school and she did not live near a good school. He is suppose to stay summers and holiday with her and come here to during the school year. \n\nMy ex wife got diagnosed with cervial cancer last month and it was caught late so it\u2019s already spread. The long term survival isn\u2019t great and I want my son to visit his mother in a week or 2 before she goes though her hysterectomy. My vacation renews every June 30th. I had saved 2 weeks to go to Hawaii this winter break. However with this situation I want to take a week or 2 to go with my son to be there for him. His mom won\u2019t be able to cook and clean for him and he also wants for me to drive up to the next city to visit his grandparents. \n\nMy gf is not happy because we have winter break set up to go to Hawaii and our flights have been booked. I called the airline and they said they would switch our flights to a later one for $600 which I offered to cover so we could rebook the vacation for next fall instead. But she thinks my son should be able to go back alone and thinks I\u2019m wasting my vacation going with him when we already have plans. My son does go on flights by himself (he is 16) however this time my ex isn\u2019t going to be physically be able to take care of our son . There are also a lot of things to be done in prep for my son and my ex before she goes through chemo and surgery. My gf is upset I\u2019m prioritizing my ex over her but I see it as going because my son might lose his mother.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s traumatic enough knowing his mom is sick and could possibly die without having to shoulder the entire situation without having you to lean on. \n\nAnd I\u2019m going to ask the hard question; if she were to pass away and you were on vacation and not able to get to your son quickly to offer him support (because he\u2019s going to want and need you for support and comfort) could you realistically look back at the situation and feel like you made a good choice? Or would you wind up resenting your GF for making you choose between your son and her rather then being supportive of the situation and allowing you to prioritize your sons need for you while navigating this scary and life changing situation?\n\nMy mother stepped up to help me with my son as well as my dad and my grandpa when my dad was diagnosed with cancer in 2017 after they had been separated since 2006 for two years before he passed away by helping take dad to appointments/grandpa to appointments or pick up my son from daycare/take him to his appointments when I wasn\u2019t able to. And his GF hated it but she sure AF was not stepping up to help and the moment my dad passed away i gleefully cut contact immediately after his celebration of life.", "You are absolutely doing the right thing.
