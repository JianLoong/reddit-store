Whether your filtered water tastes better than bottled water is a question of preference - and it depends what kind of bottled water we're talking about. Is it bottles of Dasani (which is exactly filtered city water, but bottled), or is it a strong-tasting mineral water?\n\nYour filtered water is perfectly safe and healthy, and is what you drink.

I can be picky about some things but would never expect others to do something just for me.", "NTA\n\nYou are providing a perfectly valid substitute for the water that she prefers and that you would not normally buy.\n\nIn certain areas I could perhaps understand being unhappy with the tap water, but refusing filtered water and demanding bottled is just entitled.\n\nI see it as akin to someone refusing a can of Coke because they only drink Pepsi Max, or complaining that you don't have an espresso machine to their standards and only instant/pods. \n\nWhen you travel you have to accept that not everything will necessarily be to your own preferences, and if there is anything you truly cannot live without then you should prepare accordingly.", "NTA - if she wanted specific bottled water she should have brought it.\n\nWe don't drink bottled water either. We use filtered water for our coffee and tea. But we also have a water dispenser (with hot and cold) for all of our regular drinking water and for guests. We can get our 5 gallon bottles filled with alkaline water for $5. We prefer the taste of alkaline water.\n\nThis solves the problem for all of our guests pretty much. They can get cold \"bottled\" water from the dispenser any time they want but we're not filling the landfill with plastic bottles.\n\nThe water dispenser was one of our best purchases.\n\nETA: we usually do keep a case of bottled water on hand for if the power goes out (happens here a lot).
