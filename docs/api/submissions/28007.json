There's just no reason for him to feel overly bad for acknowledging what happened, and either (a) providing a plausible reason for not keeping his word (e.g. time constraints, honestly just not being up for it, etc), or (b) acknowledging that he  doesn't have one an owning it. \n\nI expect both of you would want your children to be able to do as they grow, which they won't know how to do if they don't have a good example of that behavior in action.\n\nAlso, saw your comment that your husband wanted you to clarify a few things. To address those:\n\n1. \" I pestered him more than 3 times to explain himself.\"\n   1. Yeah. and his response was \"because I said so.\" This was something important to you that he was minimizing/ignoring. You're going to keep asking until you get something other than a non-response.\n2. \"he says I don't have good time management capabilities so he was maintaining a time line\"\n   1. He made the promise to go to the park, meaning he made and presented a plan based upon available time, and then changed the plan when that time calc didn't work out. If he's saying he was managing the time, then he gets to own the poor time management that led to the broken promise.\n   2. Further, this is beside the point. What you were asking him to do is just say exactly that to the kid. Something along the lines of \"hey bud, I'm sorry but we just ran out of time and weren't able to go today.\" You weren't digging on him for not going to the park, which is what that excuse is meant to deflect; you were digging on him not communicating clearly with your child.   \nThis speaks to that insecurity I was talking about above: disassociating shame from failure. You're asking him to communicate with the kid, but he's still fixating on defending himself against the accusation of failing the promise in the first place. He's more focused on proving that he was \"right,\" than dealing with the aftermath. The reality is that the promise breaking is one issue, and the communication piece is related but separate. There's no point in continuing to debate the first, what matters now is talking about it, which is what you're asking for.", "As a kid who grew up with parents who did exactly this to me all my childhood, I cannot say how NTA you are, and how important it is that you make your husband stop this behavior. It is very, very important for kids that parents do not dismiss them like this. I cannot stress this enough.\n\nIf he continues to do this, take no prisoners. Get him in therapy so he can understand how this affects your child. If that doesn't help, leave his ass. \n\nMany may think I'm overreacting, but as an adult with C-PTSD from exactly this kind of behavior, I know how it pans out. And you can be sure, if he does this to the kid, there's gonna be other things, too. He probably was treated like this as a child, don't in any case let him transfer it to the kid.", "NTA\n\"Because I said so\" it's not an explanation.

You're doing great. Your kids will thank you for this when they're older. I know I thanked my grandparents for the same. Your husband may not learn it very quickly though, so keep at it!

There is no need to bring out all your childhood drama just because a dad didn't give a full explanation on why they didn't go to the park. \n\n>Because I said so\" is the worst thing you can do.

Parents are in fact accountable, responsible & get to make decisions for their kids. They are the landowners, money holders, rulers of the castle & they do have the final say\u2026 So it is kind of a dictatorship.\n\nSometimes there\u2019s not enough hours in the day to explain to a little kid who has their answer but doesn\u2019t like it & wants to continue to ask \u201cwhy\u201d 300x, sass back, whine or argue about why they are not allowed to leave the house with underpants on their head, climb on to the roof, stay out until 4 am, etc.\n\nBecause the baby needs a nap does in fact mean we can\u2019t do what you want because the baby is the priority right now.

It\u2019s \u201chis money, his rules\u201d. I disagree.", "Im to sleepy to discuss English lol glad we agree on the other part though!", "Your grammar is terrible.", "tl;dr: It makes total sense to my why your H would default to the communication style you're describing factoring in the service component. That being said, that's an explanation not a justification. That behavior needs to be modified, as neither you or your 8 year old are soldiers and don't communicate that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting, so putting on my veteran hat for a second, in the military there something related to this issue that you're taught/are ingrained in you: \n\n**Do not say \"sorry\"**\n\nPumping the breaks for a sec, this is not as bad as it sounds. First this doesn't mean don't be accountable, nor does it mean that individuals are taught to be unempathetic.\n\nThe notion of not apologizing is rooted in the idea that doing so is essentially meaningless. I can say sorry all day, but it doesn't change what I've done or the consequences associated with that choice. As simply saying as much does nothing to correct any behavior, doing so can be perceived as essentially virtue signaling/casting one's self as the victim; as spotlighting how bad *you* feel versus the people you've actually harmed. \n\nFurther, it's a waste of time, expending more effort expressing how bad you feel does nothing for me; so if you're investing more time in talking about that rather than actually taking some kind of corrective action, you obviously care more about your feelings than mine, in spite of any expressed remorse you're burning my time to claim. \n\nHowever, of course people experience remorse and feel bad when they wrong others, the difference in the military you demonstrate that through your actions. Being asked to do otherwise can be perceived as being asked to be performative, which is understood as being disrespectful; and one builds a somewhat natural aversion to it.\n\nWhen you're taught that in the military, in my case from day one in basic, this is explained to you in so many words; albeit using rather abusive methods (e.g. responding to an 18 year old saying \"sorry\" with, \"oh so Im a 'sorry sergeant' now? well fuck you too, do push-ups.) but it is quite clearly communicated. The effect from an outsiders point of view is a style of communication that aggressive and uncaring, when in context it's actually not.\n\nThe central problem here however, is that that absolutely does not translate to non-military contexts and interactions, particularly with a child. From your kid's perspective, and most civilians' perspectives, it just looks like their being harmed by someone who doesn't give a toot whether or not their acting like a wrecking ball; hence the archtype of the stern distant military parent, whether or not that's their intent. \n\nSo while H may have grown up with an authoritarian parent, he interpreted that parent's actions through a child's eyes; absent the context needed to internalize that behavior in a a non-harmful way. It probably made more sense once he was in the military, but that's not going to change the harm/perceived harm he experienced when he was growing up.\n\nThere is a reason there are whole systems, albeit inadequate ones, focused on transitioning back into civilian life: the ways people communicate and act within a military will not work for most outside of the military; and if you don't adapt your behavior to a civilian mode when you get out, you're going to negatively affect your relationships, whether or not you intend to. You just have to do that. Suddenly you do need to clearly, using your words, express remorse in a way that you've been essentially trained not to.", "Why do you follow it?", "And you accept it why???", "Oh no no no \u2026. That\u2019s not how I think. It\u2019s \u201cour\u201d everything. Our kids, our house, our money, our responsibility, our rules. We have a game plan & we agree on that game plan. It\u2019s how we are successful as a family. \n\nAdults have life experience that children do not have. I have never treated my children like my peer because they are not my peer. They get the information I give them at the level they can understand it. If it\u2019s way over their heads then \u201cbecause I said so\u201d is valid.\n\nIf Dad ate something horrible at lunch & needs to get home to use the bathroom. I don\u2019t have the time to explain why we are suddenly getting in the car to 4 kids. Get in the car. \u201cWhy do we have to?\u201d Because I said so. That\u2019s a valid reason for my kids.\n\neta \u2014 any parent who says they have never said \u201cbecause I said so\u201d are full of it. There are times adults need to deal with adult reality & children do not need to be part of that adult reality.", ":)", "\"Because I said so\"\n\n\"Dad's sick\"\n\nHuh, which one of those is faster?"]}
