It means acknowledging the other person's feelings.\n\nIt paints adults in a bad light when they DON'T apologize to children.

There's just no reason for him to feel overly bad for acknowledging what happened, and either (a) providing a plausible reason for not keeping his word (e.g. time constraints, honestly just not being up for it, etc), or (b) acknowledging that he  doesn't have one an owning it. \n\nI expect both of you would want your children to be able to do as they grow, which they won't know how to do if they don't have a good example of that behavior in action.\n\nAlso, saw your comment that your husband wanted you to clarify a few things. To address those:\n\n1. \" I pestered him more than 3 times to explain himself.\"\n   1. Yeah. and his response was \"because I said so.\" This was something important to you that he was minimizing/ignoring. You're going to keep asking until you get something other than a non-response.\n2. \"he says I don't have good time management capabilities so he was maintaining a time line\"\n   1. He made the promise to go to the park, meaning he made and presented a plan based upon available time, and then changed the plan when that time calc didn't work out. If he's saying he was managing the time, then he gets to own the poor time management that led to the broken promise.\n   2. Further, this is beside the point. What you were asking him to do is just say exactly that to the kid. Something along the lines of \"hey bud, I'm sorry but we just ran out of time and weren't able to go today.\" You weren't digging on him for not going to the park, which is what that excuse is meant to deflect; you were digging on him not communicating clearly with your child.   \nThis speaks to that insecurity I was talking about above: disassociating shame from failure. You're asking him to communicate with the kid, but he's still fixating on defending himself against the accusation of failing the promise in the first place. He's more focused on proving that he was \"right,\" than dealing with the aftermath. The reality is that the promise breaking is one issue, and the communication piece is related but separate. There's no point in continuing to debate the first, what matters now is talking about it, which is what you're asking for.", "As a kid who grew up with parents who did exactly this to me all my childhood, I cannot say how NTA you are, and how important it is that you make your husband stop this behavior. It is very, very important for kids that parents do not dismiss them like this. I cannot stress this enough.\n\nIf he continues to do this, take no prisoners. Get him in therapy so he can understand how this affects your child. If that doesn't help, leave his ass. \n\nMany may think I'm overreacting, but as an adult with C-PTSD from exactly this kind of behavior, I know how it pans out. And you can be sure, if he does this to the kid, there's gonna be other things, too. He probably was treated like this as a child, don't in any case let him transfer it to the kid.", "NTA\n\"Because I said so\" it's not an explanation.

That being said, that's an explanation not a justification. That behavior needs to be modified, as neither you or your 8 year old are soldiers and don't communicate that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting, so putting on my veteran hat for a second, in the military there something related to this issue that you're taught/are ingrained in you: \n\n**Do not say \"sorry\"**\n\nPumping the breaks for a sec, this is not as bad as it sounds. First this doesn't mean don't be accountable, nor does it mean that individuals are taught to be unempathetic.\n\nThe notion of not apologizing is rooted in the idea that doing so is essentially meaningless. I can say sorry all day, but it doesn't change what I've done or the consequences associated with that choice. As simply saying as much does nothing to correct any behavior, doing so can be perceived as essentially virtue signaling/casting one's self as the victim; as spotlighting how bad *you* feel versus the people you've actually harmed. \n\nFurther, it's a waste of time, expending more effort expressing how bad you feel does nothing for me; so if you're investing more time in talking about that rather than actually taking some kind of corrective action, you obviously care more about your feelings than mine, in spite of any expressed remorse you're burning my time to claim. \n\nHowever, of course people experience remorse and feel bad when they wrong others, the difference in the military you demonstrate that through your actions. Being asked to do otherwise can be perceived as being asked to be performative, which is understood as being disrespectful; and one builds a somewhat natural aversion to it.\n\nWhen you're taught that in the military, in my case from day one in basic, this is explained to you in so many words; albeit using rather abusive methods (e.g. responding to an 18 year old saying \"sorry\" with, \"oh so Im a 'sorry sergeant' now? well fuck you too, do push-ups.) but it is quite clearly communicated. The effect from an outsiders point of view is a style of communication that aggressive and uncaring, when in context it's actually not.\n\nThe central problem here however, is that that absolutely does not translate to non-military contexts and interactions, particularly with a child. From your kid's perspective, and most civilians' perspectives, it just looks like their being harmed by someone who doesn't give a toot whether or not their acting like a wrecking ball; hence the archtype of the stern distant military parent, whether or not that's their intent. \n\nSo while H may have grown up with an authoritarian parent, he interpreted that parent's actions through a child's eyes; absent the context needed to internalize that behavior in a a non-harmful way. It probably made more sense once he was in the military, but that's not going to change the harm/perceived harm he experienced when he was growing up.\n\nThere is a reason there are whole systems, albeit inadequate ones, focused on transitioning back into civilian life: the ways people communicate and act within a military will not work for most outside of the military; and if you don't adapt your behavior to a civilian mode when you get out, you're going to negatively affect your relationships, whether or not you intend to. You just have to do that.

His heart must have been crushed knowing that the hope he had of getting to play was gone.  Especially if he saw other kids playing.  \r  \n\r  \nBut let's talk about your husband a little bit.  He tells your son that you can't visit the park on the way into town because you had things to accomplish for the day and that you would visit on the way back home.  When son reminds husband of his promise to let him play, your husband completely ignores him like he's not even there.  How does that *not* make him an AH?  \r  \n\r  \nSo then you get involved and tell your husband that he owes your son an apology and an explanation, neither of which he is willing to give.  \"Because I said so\" isn't an apology nor an explanation - it's an excuse (and a pretty poor one at that).  It's a way of telling the person that they aren't worthy of your time or energy.  Minimization at it's finest.  By the way, who acts that way towards an 8 year old child?  Your husband is an adult.  He needs to grow up and start acting like one.  \r  \n\r  \nWhen you finally insist that your husband actually bother with a real explanation, he says, \"because your brother is tired, needs a nap so sorry\u201d.  Could he *be* any more dismissive?  That wasn't an apology or explanation, either.  That was a \"shut up and get out of my face\" response.  I'm not sure that he knows how to apologize in any sort of meaningful way.  \r  \n\r  \nYour husband seems to be either ignoring the problem altogether or he's constantly shifting the blame around (from the blame being on him to the blame being on the younger kids) so that he doesn't look like the bad guy.  HE promised your son that he could play on the way home.  HE broke the promise and now HE should deal with the consequences of breaking said promise.  \r  \n\r  \nDon't make a promise that you don't intend on keeping and if there's *any* chance that you won't be able to fulfill the promise, don't make it to begin with.  Promises (and even the word promise) have no meaning without the credibility to back them up.

If this were a situation where he broke a promise to an adult, you know he would be apologizing profusely for not fulfilling his promise.  Why is it different when the person he broke the promise to is 8 years old?  Why are adults more \"worthy\" than a child?  If anything, that makes it so much worse.  \r  \n\n\n\r  \nFrom your comments:\r  \n\n\n>My husband wants me to clarify here that I pestered him more than 3 times to explain himself (why he couldn\u2019t keep his promise) in an elevated tone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell maybe if he had done as you asked the first time, you wouldn't have had to keep \"pestering\" him.  He's an adult, not a child that needs to be coddled and told how to act.  If he wants to be treated like an adult, then he needs to start acting like one.  That starts with treating his kids with the basic dignity and respect that every person (adult or child) deserves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also he says I don\u2019t have good time management capabilities so he was maintaining a timeline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yet his timeline didn't allow for your son to play at the park, even after he promised your son that he could play.  It sounds like his time management skills are lackluster at best too.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Yes we were walking (but to the car parked next to the park)then 20\u2019 by foot to a pedestrian only shopping/food area to get takeaway lunch & groceries for dinner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you went into town for the explicit reason of getting groceries for dinner (unless you weren't getting items that needed to be refrigerated), then your husband would have known *before* he made that promise of going to the park, that it wasn't going to happen.  He let your little boy get his hopes up with no intention of fulfilling his promise.  That's cruel and heartless.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He likes to point out where I\u2019m lacking that he fills in for me aka \u201cmy poor time management\u201d. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's condescension.  Pointing out your failures is his way of patronizing you so that he can maintain his illusion of control.  Instead of pointing out where you're \"lacking\", he should take a long, hard look in the mirror and do some self-realization.  I think he'd find quite a bit about himself that's \"lacking\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Flexibility isn\u2019t one of his strong suits.\n\nSorry, but when you're a parent, inflexibility isn't going to work.  When you have kids, your life revolves around their schedule(s), not other way around.  Kids come first, everything else comes second.  Period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There was no where else we needed to be but my H doesn\u2019t see it that way since it was a spontaneous idea (the park stop) & not \u201cin the plan before we left home\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat right there tells me that I was right in that your husband had no intention of fulfilling his promise to your son.  Since the park stop wasn't \"in the plan\", he saw no reason for going.  Again, he let your son get his hopes up and then crushed them when he decided it wasn't convenient for him.  Ridiculous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\r  \n\r  \nIf your husband wants to act like a decent father and husband, then he needs to sit down with you and your son and talk things out.  He needs to explain - properly - why your son couldn't play at the park when he was told that he could later on in the day, hold himself accountable for breaking a promise that he made, and suggest ways of making amends (which hopefully will involve some time at the park).  Your husband should also apologize to your son, tell him that he's sorry, and inform him that in the future if he makes a promise, he intends to keep it.  \r  \n\r  \nI (39M) apologize if this comes across as harsh.

I\u2019ve already asked him this before & his only answer so far has been \u201cbecause he (son) should have been fine with us not going to the park when he sees the other ways we try to accommodate him on other days\u201d and \u201cbecause I don\u2019t appreciate how you (mom) interjected out loud and insisted I explain more to him when it wasn\u2019t necessary\u201d according to him, by doing what I did I\u2019m destroying his attempts to bond with our son instead of support him. Btw my son doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s a stepson to my H and I\u2019ve been wanting to tell him because I believe he already senses and knows but my H wants to hold off till he\u2019s older so I\u2019m respecting that, but times like these when I see how snappy & inpatient he gets towards him, yet he shows so much unconditional love & patience to his bio toddler & newborn it kind of kills me a bit inside. I don\u2019t expect him to love my son exactly the same but when I see he\u2019s capable but chooses not to that\u2019s what breaks my heart and mama bear comes out to defend my firstborns feelings and validate him where needed.", "I told him myself before I posted his clarification that the details of what he insists are \u201ckey points to the whole story\u201d is likely irrelevant to the 3rd person looking in since ultimately he still believes I\u2019m the asshole for the stance I took regardless of my reasoning and purpose. He\u2019s truly stuck in his own way of thinking that sometimes reading the same opinion from strangers is the devils advocate we need. Now he can\u2019t deflect by saying I\u2019m \u201cswaying the public\u2019s opinions by leaving these key points out of my post\u201d he wanted to proof read my post before I posted it, but didn\u2019t so thinks adding these details changes the whole story.", "No but when he\u2019s trying to make his point he certainly does without realizing he is in the moment. He likes to point out where I\u2019m lacking that he fills in for me aka \u201cmy poor time management\u201d. Normally I let him rant but on a Sunday when the only pressing thing necessary to manage time well in is the 2nd sons nap, I didn\u2019t think it a big deal to cater to our eldest by delaying things by a half hour. There was no where else we needed to be but my H doesn\u2019t see it that way since it was a spontaneous idea (the park stop) & not \u201cin the plan before we left home\u201d. Flexibility isn\u2019t one of his strong suits.", "I will have him read your response directly as I felt the same. Thank you!", "I did actually apologize myself first to my son by saying \u201cI\u2019m so sorry it took us longer to get food & groceries and now we need to go home (it was very hot outside) to eat lunch & put your brothers to bed\u201d\u2026 but again, my son remembered that I was wanting to let him play on the way out to avoid this very situation on the way back so he answered me with \u201cbut I just want to play for a little bit since I couldn\u2019t before\u201d\nH didn\u2019t want to stay in the park with my son because 1 it was hot outside & he doesn\u2019t do well without the ac, & 2. The cranky 2yo is a handful & isn\u2019t taking being the middle child well now that he\u2019s been replaced as the youngest with his newborn brother so he\u2019s been biting & hitting all of us when he not the center of attention & it\u2019s a little dangerous atm.", "Exactly what you said is why I \u201cinsisted\u201d H takes a second to explain the why to our son. The irony here is H loves taking the time talking & explaining things to adults, strangers & coworkers but when it comes to children he has very little patience or interest esp when he\u2019s on the go & not in a stationary spot without other distractions.", "It\u2019s truly taken 10x more time trying to put this incident to rest than it would have taken with H just giving a simple honest reason in the first place to build trust and respect with my son & lead a good example but this purpose seems to have been lost by him & the need to prove his point that IATA is stronger than the lesson we all could have learned. I feel like a single parent to 4 children many days.", "All of your questions were valid. Yes we were walking (but to the car parked next to the park)then 20\u2019 by foot to a pedestrian only shopping/food area to get takeaway lunch & groceries for dinner. \nit was possible to walk all the way home without the car if one of us stayed, but H didn\u2019t want to split up or stay out longer due to my explanation above @ the heat & our 2yo being a handful to manage alone with or without the newborn & 8yo.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

My goal is to build the stepdad/son bridge in love not fester resentment or have my son one day feel how I also still feel about my own stepdad: that he played favorites & ultimately didn\u2019t love me. Thank you for your take!", "Eww. First 'because I said so' to your child and also 'don't question me' to you, OP? Please send this time traveler back to the 40s.  \nSeriously - the combination of the two is sending up some red flags.", "You nailed it. And your request isn't unreasonable or illogical in any way.  If your husband continues to ignore this, I'd lay odds that 10 years from now he will be incredibly frustrated as to why your child doesn't trust him with things.", "Why didn\u2019t you guys split up so the fussy toddlers could be addressed by one parent and your 8 year old plays at the park with the other?\n\nAlso who was the reason that your shipping took longer than expected? Did they apologize for that specifically?", "this is....a lot\n\neight is still really young and it's a bit much to expect him to remember every other nice thing his parents have done for him when right now they're saying no to something they previously said could happen.\n\nhis second explanation doesn't wash either because he should have explained before you interjected\n\nthe bit about him not knowing H isn't his bio dad....I am not an expert on child development at all but from what I have seen and read it is better for kids to know the truth of their parenthood their whole lives, rather than something being revealed later. if he'd always known H was his step dad it wouldn't be a shock or something to adjust to, it would just be normal for him.\n\nit sounds like you have way bigger problems than just this park thing, honestly", "You should respect your sons enough to insist on therapy for you and your terrible husband.", "Wow. YTA if you stay married to this nasty ass man and subjecting your eldest son to that. It\u2019s emotional abusive and I guarantee if it carries on it\u2019s going to fuck up your son for a long time", "So in other words, 'yes,' your husband does routinely speak to you in a condescending manner. Yuck.", "I understand where your coming from as this happened to me and my twin as my mum had 2 more children with him and it was always the favourite game \ud83e\udd26 I've always spoken to my partner (21M) since we have been together 3 years and never want my future children to feel the pain I felt.. hope all is okay and he can see your point of view more clearly now :))", "as your contribution.", "I have insisted but I can\u2019t force him to. The few times he did join in on my therapy session (he flatly refuses to do therapy solo) he ended up attacking my therapist & being snarky and condescending which just ended up being a complete waste of time for all of us. The only good it did was give my therapist a clear visual of who my H is in her own eyes.", "I wish we could get more upvotes on this. Maybe if enough strangers tell this man he is overbearing he will go to therapy\u2014since apparently his wife\u2019s viewpoint is down grades.", "I don\u2019t accept it but I feel hoodwinked because he didn\u2019t show this stance or mentality at all until after we got married, I had his first bio child & now the 2nd. I\u2019m newly postpartum and don\u2019t have the fight in me to fight this atm. But it frustrates me how he pretended to be this \u201cI\u2019m all about female empowerment & equal rights\u201d when that\u2019s not even remotely true to his character in the end.", "I don\u2019t. But I\u2019m trying to pick my battles and also keep the peace in front of our children. My mom & stepdad fought in front of us our whole lives growing up & I don\u2019t want to repeat that but also it\u2019s hard finding a quiet moment to discuss things privately without the kids around. And I\u2019m running on 2-3h of sleep the past 2 years.", "Just wondering at this point why you're still married to him? The picture you've painted of him is not good.", "No actually it didn't. A person coerced into attending a therapy appointment is not behaving like their everyday self, they are behaving like the version of themselves when they are backed into a corner which is never an accurate portrait. \n\nBut more importantly, surely your therapist isn't telling you to argue with your husband in front of your children? That's not appropriate, especially over such a small matter. \n\nOn the spectrum of broken promises this was at the very minor end. Certainly, something you could have discussed later and honestly not something I believe your husband needs to apologize for. Sometimes events outside of your control - like the behavior of your other children - mean you can't keep your promise (also I don't actually consider his statement a promise more like a plan). That, in my opinion, is a part of life and while you might explain why the plans have had to change I don't believe an apology for the change is required. It wasn't your husbands fault the plans had to change, it's the reality of having toddlers. Apologies, and the sentiment behind them, should mean something no thrown out like please and thanks.\n\nAlso why didn't you just explain to your son why the plan had changed. This wasn't a personal commitment, it was a general statement thrown out for what you would all do as a family.", "Dad is sick is not faster for little kids\u2026. Why? How? Is he okay? Should we freak out?", "\"Because I said so.\"  \n\"Why?\"  \n\"Because I said so.\"  \n\"But why because you said so?\"  \n\"Because I said so.\"\n\nYeah, kids can't argue about anything."]}
