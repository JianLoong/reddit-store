You have a kind heart, I can tell you feel guilty about this or you wouldn't be here asking ..also =NTA\n3. Like someone else suggested maybe swoop by the store and get a single cupcake and let said coworker know you didn't know they would be there so you picked up a special cupcake. \n4. Also know that you owe nothing to anyone. People understand shit happens... Life makes it interesting when you try to be kind sometimes we shouldn't worry about disappointing. The fact you even are questioning this makes you a decent person.
