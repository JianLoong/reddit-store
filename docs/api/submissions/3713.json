The trip was billed as for your birthday, you do not get relegated to the couch.", "NTA. There's clearly some animosity your mom holds over you for being gay, because why else would they accommodate your brother's girlfriend and her family over you and your 5 year relationship boyfriend. Also that's pretty gross him being 35 dating an 18 year old.", "NTA\n\nYour mom should stop pretending like her behavior isn't obvious to the world. This was for YOUR birthday, and you're being sent to the couch? Your parents were AHs for even thinking that was a little bit appropriate when they let your brother and his partner have a private room.", "NTA.  Wait this was YOUR birthday but you got the couch?  You should have gotten the king bed.  You mom was doing it because you have a BF and not GF.  It was intentional.", "NTA\n\nIt was your birthday trip.\n\nBTW your mom isn't a bigot. She's a homophobe. One set of rules for the cis son. A different set of rules for the gay son. You know, like the double standard sexist. Be sure she gets that right.", "NTA, you need to stand up for yourself.  Your mother obsesses about it because she feels guilty.", "NTA. I feel like you know this you just need to be reminded. Your mother is an AH though. Especially cause she was ok with your creepy 35 year old brother dating an 18 year old girl. She brings it up cause she does have an issue with your sexuality and she wants to \u201cprove\u201d she\u2019s not a bigot and make you the bad guy for throwing it in her face and making it so obvious to everyone there", "NTA - the fact the mom still brings it up is concerning - and the fact that they still go on your birthday but don\u2019t invite you is\u2026. Maybe telling? Also brother with 18yo SO - yikes! \n\nDo you get along with your family otherwise? Maybe I\u2019m reading this post differently but I\u2019m feeling a lot of underlying tension", "NTA. Tell your mom I called her a bigot. She'll know what it means.", "NTA - honestly this is why we don\u2019t do family vacas where we share the reservation/room anymore. I do not trust that anyone will make sure I have a proper room\u2026always always always book your own reservation.", "NTA\n\nOof that's cruel. There's so much wrong with that. And how begrudging is your mother that she still brings it up ten years later? She sounds absolutely toxic, and a bit like she knows you're right and she wants to keep badgering you until you pretend you weren't right.\n\nSidenote is that I'm distracted by what kind of mother and younger brother want to come on a vacation where they watch their 18y/o daughter/sister gallivanting around with a man twice her age? Just seems kinda eugh.", "NTA. Your birthday you should have gotten the king.", "NTA - without the added problem of bigotry, my mother has always played this particular game with me. In her head there\u2019s a hierarchy of importance and she allocates beds accordingly. If there\u2019s a room with less comfortable bedding, a room without adequate heating, or an outhouse, shed or vehicle that could feasibly be slept in, it was allocated to me without discussion. Until I got a long-term partner, when beds were short I typically got a sofa or a mattress in a hallway, and even now we are still bottom of the list, though more effort goes into finding alternatives now they don\u2019t want to embarrass themselves in front of my partner. Last time I visited I was offered a hotel up the road so that my little sister could have separate rooms for two of her three kids - in spite of my sister only deciding she was going to stay over the day before we all arrived, and my partner and I having to travel nearly 4 hours whereas she and her family travel just 90 minutes. It\u2019s sucky, disrespectful favouritism and your family are very much the assholes for it.\n\nIn my case, the times I do get a good deal are usually the times where my older sister and her husband stick up for me - my dad won\u2019t cause an argument over it and my little sister doesn\u2019t even notice that she\u2019s treated favourably (though her husband does, and has on one occasion volunteered the two of them to take a turn in the hallway - but that was only once over the course of 15 years or so that he\u2019s been on the scene). So your siblings also suck for not balancing things out or offering to take a fair turn with you.\n\nAnd as a side note them gaslighting you just makes it much worse. I get that too - I mentioned in passing last time I saw them how I\u2019d know I wasn\u2019t getting a bedroom for Christmas if my mum asked me what I\u2019d prefer for the Christmas dinner; both parents looked at me like I was spouting paranoid nonsense and denied everything. You\u2019re not being unreasonable OP. Arguing the toss every single time is frustrating but doing it when nobody even remembers the effort it cost is just exhausting.", "NTA - you're mother is- projecting her own guilt and shame and continually wanting to be absolved by someone about her prejudice instead of doing the work she had the years to do.  I'm curious how your partner perceives this and if he has any working relationship with your family and can support you when needed.  \n\nYou absolutely did the right thing back then, however now it sounds like you need firmer boundaries around entertaining her continued gripes.  Shut it down immediately, repeat your boundary until you sound like a broken record. \"This is not something I would like to discuss at this time. I feel uncomfortable and I would like to avoid conflict and further hurt feelings\". Boundaries aren't made, they're built over time. It's not easy and humans naturally try to bypass boundaries because we lose that immediate gratification. Hopefully it doesn't take 10 years of you giving the same response, if so you may need to consider reducing contact if it becomes too painful.
