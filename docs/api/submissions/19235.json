Moses usually finishes all his homework on the bus and Matteo is of course too young for homework, so they just watch TV or play on my switch the whole time.\n\nBut then Aunt Alex started either dropping Moses and Matteo off last-minute or warning me last minute that she needed me to babysit because of an \u201cemergency.\u201d I found out that many of these were not \u201cemergencies\u201d at all. For example, she just wanted to go to a social function. The breaking point was when she kept doing this on Fridays and Saturdays. Friday and Saturdays are my volunteer days where I am a mentor for a local program. My volunteering is important to me and I made this very clear to Aunt Alex.\n\nTwo weeks ago, enough was enough, and when Aunt Alex came to pick Moses and Matteo up, I told her that I can\u2019t keep calling out last minute from my volunteering; It\u2019s not fair to me or the other mentors who then have to shift plans/roles last minute.

My parents actually are on my side and told my Aunt Alex that she needs to figure that out on her own. I can still talk to Moses and Matteo through their Ipad, but when I explained that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch them anymore, Moses responded with \u201cI know.

And since your aunt hasn\u2019t been paying, she *should* have money saved up from all the free labor she\u2019s benefitted from. Sounds like she spent it on herself going out. Not your problem. Funny how people act shocked that childcare doesn\u2019t come cheap (unless you find someone who\u2019ll do it for free), as if that\u2019s a new situation. It\u2019s something to consider when choosing to have children.", "NTA. But their mother definitely is! She saddened and upset her sons, just to get back at you for setting reasonable boundaries.

It is your aunt who is the AH.  Can't believe she would carry things far enough to hurt her own children by telling them you did not like them anymore.  That's so mean!  I hope you did your best to reassure your cousins that you do still like and care about them, you just have other things you need to do right now.\n\nYou are young and should be free to engage in your activities like you want to.  In some ways, your aunt relying on you like she has is robbing you of your childhood freedoms and activities and that is not right.  That she would be okay with asking you to abandon your activities in favor of hers is shifting her parental responsibilities on to you.  All that is not right. I'm glad you have the support of your parents to get out of this situation where you are being used shamelessly.\n\nYou sound like a fine young lady who has done a lot to help her somewhat ungrateful and unreasonable aunt. Your parents are right that Aunt Alex needs to figure out her responsibilities and no longer put them on you.  You've done nothing wrong here and so honestly have nothing to feel bad about except that your aunt would stoop to hurting her children by telling them the lie that you no longer like them.", "NTA and her use of her children to manipulate? punish? you is utterly revolting. You're dealing with a woman who is willing to emotionally damage her children to get back at you, a teenager and member of her family, for standing up to her when she took advantage of you.\n\nI think you should show your nephew's message to your mother and let the chips fall where they may. Given her complete disregard for the feelings of her own children she will likely have no qualms about treating you even more poorly. Thank goodness your mother is in your corner, let her deal with her sister.", "NTA. I'm proud of you for setting boundaries and sticking to them. Your aunt intentionally took advantage of you. She just kept pushing until she went too far. \n\n\nI'm disgusted (but not surprised) that your aunt told her kids that you don't like them anymore. Be sure to tell Mosses and Matteo that you still love them and care about them.", "NTA.  You were doing her a favor and she abused your kindness. You've set a boundary. That's not being TA. \n\nAlso, please tell your parents what your cousins said. They should know that your aunt is lying to her children to try and manipulate you into babysitting.", "Your Aunt is an entitled piece of work.  You are NTA.  You were kind and she took advantage.  Time for her to parent her kids and yes it does mean she will have to sacrifice things.  You have done nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nYour interpretation is correct. No good deed goes unpunished. \n\nOf course, if you want to still watch them, start charging. And for tues/thurs only. No more weekends. Seems like at $15/hr she\u2019d get a great savings!", "Your aunt is a manipulative narcissist, you did nothing wrong but to stand up for yourself & not be treated like a door mat. The fact that she didn't even offer to pay you is very telling.\n\nI am sorry she is turning your nephews against you, but that isn't your problem, get on with your life. You sound like a very good person, don't let this affect you."]}
