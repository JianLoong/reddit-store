I asked if I should take my dog to the 24-hour clinic for treatment and more tests. It's a two hour drive from my house, and I was more than willing to make the trip and pay the cost of medical treatment if necessary. \n\n\\*\\*The ONLY question I asked the on-call was whether or not I should make this drive, which isn't a question where one answer or another would be better than the other. I mean, I end up stressed and tired either way. \n\n\\*I followed up with the vet during regular hours TWICE. Once on my own and the vet called me the second time.  What prompted the midnight call was the fact my dog's conditioned worsened during off hours. \n\nI (42f) need some perspective here because I'm running on very little sleep, and my twelve-year-old dog has had liquid diarrhea leaking from his butt for three days now. It's getting everywhere. I can't sleep on my bed (he'll want to hop up with me), so I've been on the floor to help him through the nights. I could crate him, but he has severe anxiety, and I kind of figured he's already having a rough enough time as it is without adding more stress. While he's in good health, he's still elderly. There's a lot more. I'll just sum it all up with it's been a whole mess, and I am wondering if my anger is justified or if I'm lashing out at this woman because I'm so stressed.\n\nOn that note, sorry if this is poorly written/redundant.\n\nSo, I took my dog to the vet on Monday and they gave him some anti-diarrhea medicine and fortiflora. The stool sample they took indicated it was probably just his system out of whack, but he just keeps getting worse. The vet told me to give his system time to adjust and correct itself with the meds (which absolutely makes sense), so I waited.\n\nLast night blood appeared in his stool. This, combined with the fact he's only gotten worse while on treatment, made me worried enough that I decided to call the on-call vet at 12:00am to ask for guidance. Basically, I wanted to know if I should be concerned enough to drive the two hours to our nearest 24-hour vet, who weren't picking up their phone.\n\nThat's where the on-call vet thinks I'm the asshole. She basically laid into me for calling her about mere diarrhea. She really wanted me to know I was wasting her time because she couldn't run tests at 12:00am. Basically, she told me to fuck off if my dog isn't dying. And I'm just like, \"Lady, I don't know if he's dying. That's why I called.\"\n\nMy perspective is that I wasn't calling about mere diarrhea. I was calling about rapidly worsening diarrhea that now contained blood. I didn't want to be overly reactive and spend thousands on emergency medical treatment that could have waited until the morning (nor did I want to drive two hours on one hour of sleep), but I also I wanted to do what was best for my dog. I felt like I needed expert advice to make the best decision.\n\nThe conversation I wanted to have would have taken two minutes of her time. She kept me on the phone for around seven minutes yelling at me. I'll confess I snapped and yelled back. I mean, I'm not sure what her purpose is if it's not to give emergency medical advice, and I told her as much.\n\nMaybe I did call her for no reason and waste her time. I mean, I'm not thinking super clearly right now tbh. But I wasn't calling her out of spite. I felt like I had solid justification for being worried.

I don't get mad when I'm on-call and someone calls me during my on-call hours because... that's my fucking job. It's what I'm paid for.\n\nI assume she was having a bad day, but you absolutely would not be an asshole for posting a bad review. Just like a doctor dismissing someone's symptoms, a vet dismissing a pet's symptoms is never the correct answer. Yes, it may be annoying as fuck to have another person be like, \"Oh so I have a sniffle. Am I gonna die?\"\n\nBut you're a care provider. If you can't do your job, don't sign up for it.\n\nIt was literally as simple as, \"How much blood? Does she have any other symptoms? She most likely has blood from straining. If you see it in the morning, please come see us, she should be fine overnight.\"\n\nViola, you're done and you did your job.", "She's supposed to be a professional; she shouldn't have yelled at you. Diarrhea can be serious; when it goes on long enough there's risk for dehydration. Getting worse and having blood is a good reason to call the vet; I would have called them too. NTA.", "NTA and YWNBTA. This person's job is to ease your worries and try to give you the best sound advice possible. Instead you were met with a miserable person who doesn't like doing their job. Blood is usually a cause for concern. Especially if the diarrhea has been persistent. Good luck to you and pupper!", "NTA\n\nShe's on call, meaning people will call her at that time. If she doesn't want to be, she can get a new job. \n\nHer behavior should be reviewed so other people will know that she's not trustworthy or reliable to contact.\n\nPeople will be calling her in very scary and stressful moments! She needs to be a calming, reassuring voice on the line. Not yelling at you, or claiming you're wasting Her time. That's literally what she's there for.", "NTA. I can't see what you did wrong. A pet with worsening diarrhea and now blood in stool is frightening. If it was tarry blood, I'd have been at OOH vet because that is seriously bad news. Red is usually just irritation from the diarrhea but most people are fortunate enough not to know that. And phoning vet is only way to get reassurance.\n\nThere are different types of on-call vets though. OOH when they are up in a building with support staff and telephone consult not unusual. And then the one where you wake a vet up out of sleep and they need to turn on the bedside manner. They're human. It doesn't always work. I'd not leave the review in later case because it might put people off phoning for help to detriment of pet. First scenario, I would raise with my own vet or practice manager.", "NTA nor would be an AH for leaving a negative review. \n\nThe whole point of an on-call medical professional is to advise if you need an ER or if it can wait until the office is open. I doubt you went into it expecting her to diagnose, prescribe, and treat it. \n\nI would also reach out to the clinic\u2019s manager and let them know how you were made to feel in this situation. Apologize for your own anger in it (even though it was justified) but express that you\u2019ve been extremely worried and weren\u2019t sure the best way to proceed.", "NTA \n\nIn my opinion you are not the asshole for calling. The on-call vet is there for exactly such cases where a pet is suddenly getting worse and the owner needs help direct and can not wait for the next work day.\nThe change from diarrhea to diarrhea with blood is an event that would cause any concerned owner to call the vet. \n\nWhile you might not be the asshole for calling the vet, you might have been an asshole during the call. You mentioned losing it and shouting so depending on what exactly happened you might be an asshole for that reaction. But thats very hard so evaluate from your description. \n\nIn my opinion you would also not be an asshole for posting a bad review about them as again it's literally the one job of the on call to be there for such events so treating you like they did is really bad. \n\n\nSo overall NTA in my opinion.", "Blood in the stool generally needs evaluation. If the medicines were not working, then yes, the pooch needs help.\n\nWhy did you call her at midnight? If the blood appeared after 10 pm, then NTA.\n\nThis still does not absolve the vet of her unprofessional behaviour.\n\nHope your dog gets better soon!", "NTA - if they don't want calls, don't have an after-hours number.\n\nFor your dog, I am not a vet but I have a cat with GI issues that causes him diarrhea if we're not consistent with his diet and medication. He is prescribed Endosorb, and I looked it up and they have Endosorb for dogs, too. Basically, it will help his stool firm up. It takes about a day and a half to two days if you follow the dosing instructions from the vet. They also can prescribe a steroid medication if he's having inflammatory issues.\n\nFor blood in pet stool, if the blood is bright red, this is not as much of a worry (as I've been told numerous times by the vet when I've called, too). Bright red blood means likely he has abrasions near the rectum, probably from being irritated so much from all the diarrhea. Heck, when my GI issues flare up and I'm pooping liquid, I bleed sometimes, too. Unless it looks like he's hemorrhaging (MASSIVE amounts of blood), bright red blood is not too concerning as far as it being an emergency. What the vet will be concerned about is dark blood. Dark blood in the stool (especially dark dark brown or black) is a cause for alarm.\n\nAgain, I am not a vet. This is what has been told to me numerous times from three different vets for my cat's diarrhea problems.  \n\n\nETA: for the blood also, if he has any firm poops at all and you can tell if the blood is on the outside or mixed in with the firmer stool, this is helpful. Blood on the outside is the issue I mentioned above -- bleeding from irritation. Blood mixed in the inside of the stool is more cause for alarm. Bright red, still, they won't be concerned about unless it's a massive amount.", "I sympathise with you, and hope you poor dog will be ok. I have been in situations with various pets like this, and the lesson I've learnt is to always trust your gut. You know your pet better than anyone, and can really evaluate changes when they are unwell. \n\nGiven your pup is elderly and this has been going on for days, and has only gotten worse since seeing a vet, a change like this is scary for both you and your pup. Especially when things like this happen after hours (it always is, isn't it!). \n\nI understand that being a vet is a high pressure job, and that sometimes comes with people snapping. But, that doesn't make the way you were treated ok, especially because they continued on for over seven minutes. \n\nI think one way to deal with this may be to phone the clinic up and tell another staff member about it and what happened, and how it made you feel. That way, in case the vet was having a difficult personal time, it can be dealt with in a less public manner by other staff at the clinic.", "NTA. We actually just went through something similar to this recently. My dog started with diarrhea and rapidly developed bloody diarrhea which then in turn rapidly worsened into complete blood. He spent many nights and thousands of dollars at the emergency vet and we thought we were going to lose him at one point. He ended up having hemorrhagic gastroenteritis which is very dangerous if not treated. So your worries are 100% valid ( I'm not saying that your dog has this ) because bloody diarrhea is never something that should be ignored and it's very odd for your veterinarian to not care about blood in the stool.", "NTA. By her logic, people shouldn't go to the ER unless they're dying. When your medical expertise is sought, give it. \n\nTry to get some rest before you leave the review. You won't be an asshole if you leave a negative review because future clients need to be warned, but I feel like reviews that are carefully considered are the most persuasive. \n\nPraying for your dog.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBeing on-call means that you're prepared for just these kinds of situations. Blood in the stool is never a good sign, and you felt like you had reason to be worried. Yelling probably wasn't the best response, but it's completely understandable, given the stress you were under and the fact that she started yelling at you first. I would certainly leave a review for her so she doesn't end up yelling at another owner who's just concerned for their pet. I hope your pupper starts feeling better soon. \n\n(As for the mess, I think they make doggy diapers. He probably wouldn't be very happy, but it could be a stopgap measure until the medicine takes effect.)", "NTA\n\nYou were worried about your dog. The on-call vet\u2019s job is to handle situations like yours. I wouldn\u2019t blame you for leaving a bad review. Bloody stool from an elderly dog (especially ) could be serious. She should have explained in a calm professional manner.", "NTA. You asked her to do her job and was willing to pay for it.", "Wow, I was ready to be on the vets side because of the mention of leaving a bad review, but absolutely NTA. \n\nHaving a sick dog, especially if they have a condition that lasts for days, can be mentally and physically exhausting. I had a dog that was epileptic, and when he\u2019d have seizures, they were often in the middle of the night. So my husband and I would take turns staying up with him. We\u2019d have to move furniture, get towels ready, pad anything we could (like low bookshelves), and be ready to catch him if he got caught up on something or started having another seizure. Often, he\u2019d have 3, sometimes within an hour or 2, but sometimes it would last a week. \n\nThere was no downtime. You couldn\u2019t let your guard down. And it was heartbreaking, because he had these start when he was 2, and they went on until the end of his life this past summer at the age of 8. He was the sweetest boy. So I completely understand and sympathize with you. The mess, the worry, the frustration of not knowing what to do or when it\u2019ll end, etc. \n\nThat vet is on call at midnight *for that very reason*. You were asking if it was concerning to her, enough for emergency care. Blood in stool is sometimes a bad sign, so you were right to call. She had absolutely no right to treat you that way. Completely uncalled for, unprofessional, and just plain heartless. \n\nPlease, instead of a review, please contact the lead vet and customer/patient relations person. If you like this office, a bad review reflects poorly on it\u2019s entirety. Go to the head of staff. Tell them how you were treated, and make sure they know about your dog. Good luck, and hang in there. I hope your dog feels better soon, and you get some good rest!", "What's the point of being an on call vet of you won't help sick pets?\n\nNTA and you should rip her a new one in a review.

Did the exchange get heated?  Most likely.  But the vet was well within their rights to explain the diarrhea is not an overnight emergency.

For me what kind of puts me in E S H here territory on this one is this: If the condition of your pet was steadily worsening rather than improving ever since your appointment on Monday, which you said it was, you should have been on the phone with the vet Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during regular business hours providing an update and asking for guidance and if they needed to see your pet again... rather than waiting until the middle of the night to wake someone up who was on call.\n\nWhen you didn't call during business hours several days in a row to report the condition worsening and the dog suddenly got *even sicker* in the middle of the night, you were left with no choice but to wake someone up.

Why even fucking have a number if no one knows when to use it and you hate answering it.", "Nevertheless, OP has an elderly dog with worsening diarrhea and has been sick for more than 3 days now. The stool also has blood. So, does this not qualify as an emergency?\n\nEven if not, then a simple civil explanation would have sufficed. Clearly the person who answered the call was unprofessional. OP is NTA.", "Vet tech here! I second your comment. \nPeople seem to think being on call means you take calls...  the vet is there to handle emergencies AT THE CLINIC. Also every clinic I've worked in would never give medical advice over the phone - one you can misdiagnose, two - what you think is bad diarrhea may not be actually that bad as you think- youre not medically trained. If you as a pet owner are worried about your animal, i will always tell you to bring the animal in. We cant help you if we dont have the animal in front of us. Its nothing like human medicine - we need to physically examine the animal or stool sample. If the vet said it's gonna take time to get better, calling after a few days isnt really giving it time. Im sorry you didnt get the info you wanted, but it wouldnt matter who was on the other end of the phone - there is no way they could tell you it was life threatnening or not over the phone. In the veterinary field we deal with so many more rude, angry and outright mean clients than other industries .", "You did an awful lot of assuming there. Sounds to me like, y t a.", "Very good points.", "But the blood didn\u2019t appear until the middle of the night\u2026that\u2019s what really prompted the phone call.", "I had touched base with my vet during regular hours--twice. I followed up once and they followed up once. As I said in the post, they told me to let the medicine correct his system. I called at 12:00am because that's when my dog's condition worsened.", "They didn\u2019t see blood in the dogs stool until 11:45pm. She said they told her the dogs system would take a bit to re-set. She was following their orders until a new, alarming, and potentially dangerous symptom came up, after hours. Not sure how she had poor planning when, if she did call them, they\u2019d say to stay the course and contact them *if the situation worsens*.", "Did they give you a plan :  withhold food, bland diet, make sure he\u2019s drinking and not vomiting?  Or did they tell you to rush him in , stay open late and run tests on him?  Because that\u2019s the difference.  Diarrhea for a few days isn\u2019t an emergency.  We give owners a plan, maybe some medication, and see how things go.  It\u2019s entirely correct to answer those questions 20 minutes before closing.  I bet they didn\u2019t tell you to rush in tho.", "OP has already stated that she\u2019s dropped off a stool sample and is awaiting test results, so, yes, the ER vet was correct.", "You're welcome! I know how you feel about the mess. We had to put sheets all over the furniture so we could see anywhere he got poop. We were washing two loads of linens/sheets every day until we got him on the medicine. \n\nThe other thing, too, that helped was keeping him on a consistent diet of good quality food (not cheap kibble), that will help. Pet's GI system can be really sensitive to changing brands over and over. They like consistency. We also have to limit wet canned food. It always makes him have a flair up.", "Everything I stated is readily available information written by vets on a myriad of websites from which you can ascertain and verify what I've said here. Experience also counts for something. If you've spent two years going to a vet twice a month for these health conditions, you actually learn something about that condition.", "I'm not sure as I don't know what her vets normal policy is around emergency calls. My vet does not do after hours emergency calls, but if that's a service that her vet offers I do think it's a weird thing that he would yell at her for it. If it's not a service the vet offers and she just called anyway then I can get them getting upset with her for that. I don't know, I just know that you should get your dog seen if the dog has bloody diarrhea. You can triage over the phone for questions like bloody diarrhea. Pediatricians offices use triage all the time to let you know if you should go into the urgent care or emergency clinic. So while they can't diagnose over the phone, if it's a service they offer they can triage and tell you if they believe the animal can wait or if they should go get seen. now, based on my experience with the pediatrician after hours calls we usually get told to get seen because they don't want the liability, but it is a service that a lot of medical practitioners do utilize.", "The person you're describing would have already posted the review and demanded the on-call's termination to get that instant gratification. Also, your post is conjecture.", "Ever consider they're complaining because you have a shitty bedside manner?\n\nBecause that's definitely the impression I'm getting from all of your posts. The utter lack of sympathy and care about both the animal and the owner makes me wonder why you ever became a vet - if you really are one.", "On call is like a human doctor... its a term for an emergency doctor... they sit in the clinic in casean emergency comes in.... do you call an emergency hospital to ask questions? Im sure the vet indicated to bring the animal in a pay  very expensive fees for something that isnt an emergency. Most people won't bring them in.", "A vet in the thread has already answered this. Vets cannot provide medical advice over the phone. It is a liability. They will tell you to bring your dog in for emergency care right them $$ (OP already indicated she didn't want to drive the two hours to do this) or decide if you want to wait until morning. They cannot diagnose a patient over the phone. They need to see the animal to make a diagnosis.", "Honestly most people don\u2019t know what a human emergency is either, so don\u2019t blame vets.  How many people go to the er for a cold or flu?  I was in the er once and a woman came in with a toothache.  She was told to leave because THEY AREN\u2019T DENTISTS.", "It doesn\u2019t qualify as an emergency.  And again, as stated, you only have the owners side of the story.  She was emotional (which she admits).  There\u2019s zero proof the vet wasn\u2019t professional, only hearsay.", "It's not that hard to answer, \"From what I'm hearing, I don't think it's an emergency, though I can't say for certain unless I actually examine the animal. If you're really concerned, you can take him to the emergency vet, but otherwise, you can bring him in to the office tomorrow.\"", "Because I dislike people coming on Reddit asking if they\u2019re the AH when we clearly only have one side of an argument?  An argument I\u2019m intimately familiar with?  Do you know how many owners get mad at my staff because we can\u2019t cure their pet over the phone?  Can\u2019t just give out medication without seeing their pet?  Nothing I said in my post was based on any assumptions, it\u2019s all backed up by her post.  (Except maybe for saying it\u2019s highly unlikely the vet said to \u201cfuch off\u201d.  That alone told me this person\u2019s post was simply emotion and nothing more.)", "Sure... but is blood in stool always an emergency that warrants a trip to the emergency vet two hours away? I am interested to learn if OP wound up taking her dog there, or decided to wait until morning because in fact, it was not an emergency.\n\nIt's always important to discuss with your vet/doctor during the regular appointment what worsening symptoms would constitute an emergency. We do this whenever we have an appointment where one of our animals is sick. Our vet doesn't have after hours care or an on call number so we are the ones who would have to decide whether to drive to the emergency vet or not. OP should always ask her vet these questions during regular office hours because what OP is panicking and believing to be an emergency at 12 AM, might not be an emergency at all, and by discussing this with the vet in the appointment, she will already have this information and not need to wake them up.", "Okay, maybe add that information to your original post.\n\nJust one thing to consider before leaving that nasty review... be grateful that they even *have* the option of an on-call after hours number. My vet does not. On weekends and after hours, our only option is to drive to the emergency vet and pay those huge fees. Just think carefully about what the repercussions of your review might be before leaving it in anger.", "Perhaps this is a combination of poor communication and not asking enough follow up questions on both parts? We always make sure at human and animal appointments to ask what worsening symptoms *would* constitute an emergency and what do we need to be on the lookout for since we did not attend vet or medical school, when should we go to the ER or worry, since what can seem super scary to us in the middle of the night might seem like no biggie to a vet or doctor and can wait until business hours. \n\nThese are critical questions to ask in the regular appointment since our vet does not have someone answering after hours calls and the emergency vet may not have specialist care for all types of animals.", "LOL.", "\u201cThey sit in the clinic in case an emergency comes in\u201d\n\nPlease be aware this is not always the case.  If we are talking about a 24hr facility, yes (but if you think they\u2019re just sitting around\u2026)\n\nIn smaller areas an on call vet is not necessarily in the clinic.  The vet will be paged at home, asses the situation and decide if it warrants coming in.  This also may/may not calling in other staff as well.  We don\u2019t have enough info here to know if OP was calling a fully staffed 24 hr facility or not.  (On most cases, if you call a 24 facility, you will talk to the front desk staff, not a doctor.

An emergency vet is a 24 hr clinic.", "Telling them they can't diagnose over the phone, but here are the possibilities...is NOT 'diagnosing over the phone. It's providing the owner with all the knowledge they can *over the phone*, then letting the owner make a decision based on better knowledge.\n\nIt's no worse than a human doctor taking COVID calls over the phone : Here are the symptoms I'm showing, should I go to the ER or is this likely just a cold?", "So with that argument, maybe neither party is at fault? Meaning the vet or doctor can\u2019t be mad that the patient doesn\u2019t know what constitutes an emergency (in a seemingly grey area like OP\u2019s) and the patient can\u2019t be mad at the vet or doctor for not advertising exactly what constitutes an emergency.", "This is exactly what we deal with. You cant call a hospital and ask questions to a doctor... why do you think a vet sits around and waits for phone calls to answer questions... diarrhea with a bit of blood isnt an emergency- its a sign of irritation. Did OP do a full blood panel? Is OP feeding an adequate food... table scraps? We know nothing of this dogs state, we're listening to the side of a stressed out and panicked owner. How do you know their vet didnt say diarrhea would continue for a few days and might have small amounts of blood.  I will once again repeat - vets do not give medical advice over the phone- its a liability. I am almost certain that the vet probably explained that and then indicated to bring their animal in directly- at a very high price OR wait until the following day and book a vet apt. How would yoh all feel if your dog was hit by a car - laying on a table waiting for life saving surgery --and a vet is stuck on the phone with a customer who is worried and has multiple questions about diarrhea.  Also - OP did the dog die? Is the diarrhea better? Have you brought your dog in for a full blood panel?

We're hearing one side of the story... also i would like to know if OP brought the dog for a second visit or if the diarrhea was an emergency and the dog is now dead... i can tell you from my experience i tell people that exact info onthe phone and half of them scream at me because they dont wanna pay the fees and they just want a free answer over the phone.", "This is reddit.

In this case, no it\u2019s not.  Blood in the stool in a dog especially with a history of diarrhea means the colon is inflamed.  Does that require treatment?  Absolutely.

We always ask this whether it's at the vet or the human doctor because as untrained people who didn't go to medical or vet school, what seems SUPER SCARY to us (blood in stool) might actually be no biggie to the vet and can wait until morning, but there might be another symptom that we might well overlook because again, we did not go to vet school. So the OP should be asking her vet at every single appointment for the symptoms to be concerned about and when to go the ER vet.
