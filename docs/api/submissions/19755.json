I wasn't watching them, but I heard my sister say twice very loudly that my brother was being \"fruity\" with the ice cream and I was kind of confused and uncomfortable so I asked her what she thought it meant and and if she thought it meant gay and she said yes. I told her I didn't think that was cool and that she shouldn't say it. In my opinion, using words like \"fruity\" as derogatory can be hurtful, and I'm tired of boys being called gay and made fun of for things like eating. When I said something to her about it, she asked my brother if he was offended and he kind of tried to diffuse the situation saying something like he didn't want us to fight over him. It was kind of awkward and I could tell I upset her but we said goodbye and goodnight. The next day she told me that she wanted to talk to me but kept putting the conversation off. When I asked her at night if she still wanted to talk, she told me that she didn't feel like what she said was offensive and that I misinterpreted her. She also said multiple times that I'm the only one she's ever heard of being offended by this. I tried explaining why it was offensive, but she kept saying I was misunderstanding, even telling me that one of her friends said that it wasn't offensive as well. Eventually I called her selfish and said that she didn't actually want to understand, she just wanted to tell me I'm wrong.

It's offensive. There is nothing bad about being gay or liking ice cream. If your sister thinks eating ice cream in a particular way is gay, then she is homophobic.", "NTA. She wasn't talking about Fruity Pebbles. She told a boy that he was eating ice cream in a homosexual manner which is derisive of both the boy and homosexuality.", "NTA. Bull-fucking-shit you misunderstood her, she told you point blank that she *was* using the word \"fruity\" to call him gay as an insult. It's shitty homophobic behavior, and even if your little brother is straight it's still harmful to reinforce that unless he forces himself to act in specific ways that may not be natural to him he will be perceived as \"gay,\" and therefore \"bad.\"\n\nNot to mention just carrying and reinforcing the idea in itself that \"gay\" is something to insult someone with...that's shitty behavior in *any* context? Even if she's just describing a book she didn't enjoy reading.\n\nYour sister's behavior is absolutely shitty and her refusal to engage with why it's a problem is indeed selfish.", "NTA. You\u2019re right about the comment and about her refusing to understand.\n\nIf she persists, I\u2019d ask her if she was intending to make fun of him. And if (*when*) she says yes, ask her what she thinks is so funny/insulting about being gay?", "NTA.  You are right on the money.  Your sister doesn't want to be considered \"one of those people\" who say homophobic stuff and you held up a mirror to her showing her an image she doesn't like.  While she may be bent now, my guess is she will be more aware next time.  You've done your sisterly duty here.", "NTA", "NTA.

Say to her You'd do the same if it was your brother calling her names and you'd expect the same from both of them in regards to you. Do not settle for the lower version of your loved ones, call them out so they can honour the best versions of themselves. If you all as siblings won't do it, then the world will but not in comprehensive nor kind way.", "NTA your sister was basically bullying your brother, I would of called her out too", "NTA - If you didn't tell her, someone else would have in far less kind tones. She's 17 so likely going to college soon and you better believe someone there would have taken offense.", "NTA", "YTA for getting offended and budding into something that you had nothing to do with. If they were fighting, then yeah, fine. Then you double down even though the brother didn't want it getting awkward. Stop being \"gay\" and talk your sister about it, make up, and laugh about a misunderstanding around other people's sense of humor", "ESH. You did blow it out of proportion by saying that she's selfish, I just don't think that's the word for what was going on. But your sister was being ignorant and close minded.", "ESH   \nYou could have taught her that using that word might be offensive to some people, even if she doesn't intend it to be, even if her friends agree with her. It has potential to hurt feelings and make her look bigoted and ignorant.    \nThe brother said that he doesn't want you two fighting over him. He felt more uncomfortable over you two getting in an argument than to be called a name he doesn't seem to be very offended or persecuted by. That was his request. His request didn't matter to you and your sister.  \nYou also didn't see what the brother was doing. It could be that he was pretending to do something inappropriate like pretending he was performing fellatio on someone and being vulgar. It might have made your sister uncomfortable and saying \"fruity\" was the only way she could tell him to stop. Did you ask her if she thinks being gay is inherently bad? What exactly was he doing that made her want him to stop? Did you find out?  \nYou took offense to a word even though the comment was not directed at you, and taking offense for a group you might not belong to seems phony and arrogant, and you come across as simply wanting to be correct and righteous.   \nYour sister made a poor defense, you made a silly attack, and your brother sucks. lol, sucks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister said something obviously offensive, and you were right to call her on it. If her friends are telling her it's not offensive, she has terrible friends.", "NTA. As a gay guy I can tell you, being called fruity is just a coverup for saying something like faggy or girly. It means the same thing. It\u2019s derogatory and an insult (i mean it doesn\u2019t bother me personally but that is the intent of it).\n\nStanding up for your brother was the right call and your sister is TA.", "NTA it is absolutely offensive and thank you for telling her that. I think she's just too immature to digest this information right now. Hopefully it sticks with her and she doesn't say it again, even if she doesn't really understand why yet.", "Within the LGBTQ community calling each other fruity has definitely taken off lately and it is possible that either your siblings are both part of that community or that your sister misunderstood the context of the word if she has LGBTQ people in her social circle. Definitely NTA with a possible NAH depending on other details.", "NTA. Unless your sister is gay, then it is offensive. I am gay and you can show her this comment. She, even if unintentionally, was perpetuating toxic masculinity and homophobia. You\u2019re a good sibling to call it out. And dear little sister, if you see this post: pride is a killer. You become a better person when you accept that you\u2019re in the wrong and lean into growth. Always stay growing.", "NTA and your sister is homophobic", "ESH.\n\nYou for telling your sister she was selfish and didn't want to understand.  If the tact you were taking wasn't making it through, then try another tact.  Either that or leave it until another time when maybe the message will get through.  Insulting and berating her guarantee that the message won't be heard.\n\nYour sister for bullying your brother.  Also her friend is not a great arbiter of what is socially acceptable, especially at that age.  She did want to talk with you about it but could not make you understand.  Another tact by her might have been helpful but she gets a soft pass due to her age.  She'd better learn soon as adulthood is quickly approaching.", "Exactly. She's gatekeeping how to eat ice cream. That can't be good for his self esteem. Well done looking after him.", "Exactly. She's gatekeeping how to eat ice cream. That can't be good for his self esteem. Well done looking after him.", "Homophobia is not a sense of humour.", ">Stop being \"gay\"\n\nHuh?", "i should have mentioned in the original post that she was openly laughing and making fun of him. my brother also mentioned that it's something shes done before and he did seem made more uncomfortable by the fact that we were at odds than anything. its not so much that i care about being correct or righteous, it's that my little brother talks a lot about feeling like he can't express feelings properly because he is a boy and I feel like making fun of him for things that are seen as effeminate reinforces that. That was the gist of what I said to her when we first talked.", "I'm not saying homophobia is a sense of humor. There's ways of finding out information without blowing up at the person. It can be the same way as women calling each other \"bitches\" but amongst each other. OP needs to get a grip and properly show their siblings what's inappropriate. They're still kids.", "Ahh, great clarification. Your sister does sound like she's formed a bad, dumb habit. That could more hurtful to your brother than she realizes. Her taunting might make him feel like he has to be mindful of his body language, how he speaks, feeling sensitive and saying \"aww\". A lot would revolve around not looking or acting gay and not just around the sister but in life in general.   \nHe's still 14, he shouldn't have to worry about that, whether he is gay or not. Is he going to have to be paranoid every time he eats a banana? Is he going to always be mindful of his tone of voice? It would distracting for him to always have that on his mind.   \nI think it's great that he can talk to you about those feelings of has. And kids his age, all of them, even if they're straight, they all act a little effeminate. Their wrists are floppy, their voices raise in pitch in weird moments, they lack facial hair. The sister is close to being an adult now and should know when she sounds like a silly kid. Someday she's gonna call a straight, adult man with insecurities fruity and he might get extremely mad. Those are fighting words. If he's got a bad group of friends and he needs to prove himself, he might come back with harsher words himself and start harassing her badly. And if she calls an actual gay kid that, she could face serious consequences if she's in college. \n\nI go with NAH now. The kids gotta learn and you can adapt to sister's learning style.", "OP did do that, and the sister is in denial because she wants to be.", "How is the sister not an ass if theyre making fun of a kid for eating ice cream? I want you explain to me which part of that was beneficial for him.", "Then I suggest OP let the parents handle it. They're still kids and can still learn about stuff being wrong. And if not then I'm sure they'll drop their sibling as a family member anyway. People here do that for a lot less", "Nah. Combatting bigotry is everyone's job. If that sister got this far thinking that it's ok to call someone fruity, the parents aren't doing the job.", "NTA\n\nYou're on the money here. She's upset she got told off in front of your brother, plain and simple. She doesn't care if she was being hurtful, she cares that someone told her, \"no that's wrong.\"", "NTA- I called out a sibling the other day.  \n\nYou are doing her a favor by talking to her about it.\n\nYou can tell her that if it wasn't you, someone would think that she discriminates against people who are gay.  And make other assumptions based on her using that language.  Not good assumptions about her.", "No, you did the right thing. She might genuinely have not meant to be rude though - I remember with some horror the phase I went through of using the 'r' word. I thought it was fine 'cause I knew I didn't mean it like that. It took someone older saying \"okay, but does everyone else know you don't mean it like that?\" to give me my lightbulb moment. Hopefully once your sister cools off this can be her lightbulb moment.", "NTA, she was using it to make fun of him, so yeah, its derogatory. \"Fruity\" can be used in non-derogatory ways, such as an actual LGBTQ+ person using it as a descriptor for themselves (something i do regularly lmao), but thats obviously not whats going on here.", "A male eating either ice cream or a banana in a sus way is one of the funniest things that anyone can witnesses, paired with the joyful embarrassment of trying to not look sus while eating it, but ending up looking even more sus.\n\nI hate this new generation sucking (pun intended) the joy out of everything.", "NTA. Send her the Hilary Duff PSA commercials from the early 2000s. What she's doing isn't new, and it isn't cool. Keep defending your brother. It might make him uncomfortable to see you guys fighting, but it's for a good reason.", "I never said it was beneficial. I said that the 17 year old sister calling brother fruity is doing more damage to him than she thinks. It would make him self-conscious.   \nI also said the brother should not feel uncomfortable to act however he wants. He should not fear being called names.   \nI sympathize with him because I remember being that age, and it was really common to be called gay for anything remotely feminine. If two guy friends are walking close to each other and accidentally touch hands, they would recoil and go, \"ugggghh! You're gay!\" \"Nah, you're gay!\" Dumb kid insults. But it could be negative in a certain context, even if the person that said it didn't mean it that way.   \n\n\nI said No Assholes Here because brother was the victim, the younger sister is just ignorant and I think calling her an Asshole sounds harsh, but ass sounds appropriate. Jerk is good. Dumbass would fit nice. \n\nAnd I said the older sister tried her best to explain why the word shouldn't be used, but could just try again to talk some more sense into her younger sister. Maybe she could show her a youtube video or something.", "NTA. What she said IS offensive. It's no better than telling someone \"that's SO GAY!\" like the kids used to do when I was in school. She's using a term for queer folks (which in itself is fairly derogatory, IMO) in a derogatory way. She doesn't get to pretend that it isn't offensive.", "NTA, you asked her to clarify at the time and she confirmed it. What is there to \u201cmisinterpret\u201d? She literally confirmed it herself for you, when it happened. She just doesn\u2019t like that she\u2019s getting called out for behind homophobic. And so she\u2019s asking all her homophobic friends if they think it\u2019s offensive or not for her own confirmation bias.", "NTA . sister on the other hand", "Her saying it\u2019s fruity is no different to when a guy makes sexist jokes when a girl eats a banana. \nShe\u2019s being purposefully obtuse"]}
