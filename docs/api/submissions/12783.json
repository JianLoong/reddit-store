{"id": 12783, "submission_id": "11wxah0", "title": "AITA for telling my in future in-laws that it's not a wedding gift unless it's given to both people and telling my fiancee I don't want to live in a house I don't own?", "selftext": "My fiancee \\[27F\\] and I \\[29M\\] grew up very differently. I was an immigrant who moved here when I was 6, and we were definitely struggling a lot. My parents worked extremely hard to provide for me and siblings, and they always prioritized our education over everything. My dad always told me it was his dream to live in a house that he owned, since we'd always rented, but he couldn't save up enough since we were renting in expensive areas with good schools. Unfortunately, both of my parents passed away before being able to realize that dream. My dad passed away when I was 17 and my mom passed away almost 3 years ago due to covid.\n\nMy fiancee grew up fairly wealthy. Like private schools, designer clothes, 3-4 international vacations per year flying first or business class the whole way. I was able to attend college thanks to student loans, scholarships, and part-time jobs, which delayed my graduation a bit, while her parents were able to fairly easily cover all expenses themselves. However, I'm the last person to say that my fiancee hasn't earned everything she's gotten. She's an extremely intelligent person, and besides funding her education, her parents are in no way responsible for her accomplishments.\n\nMy fiancee and I met 6 years ago when we started working at the same company, in the same position, at the same time, after graduating from college. We hit it off almost instantly and it didn't take long for us to start dating. Both of us still work at the company, however I've progressed through the career ladder a bit more quickly than she has and now make just over twice what she does. I'll be the first to admit that this is completely undeserved and I've benefitted from a lot of luck and definitely some sexism as well, since we work in a male-dominated field. Still, that has allowed me to aggressively attack my student loans, and once they were payed off, I put that into saving up for a down payment on a house as a way to fulfill my parents dreams.\n\nI proposed about 6 months, and things have been great so far. However, this past weekend, we were at her family's house, when her parents told us that for a wedding present, they were going to give us a house. My fiancee was overjoyed, and although I was also happy, I wanted to know the details as well. Pretty quickly, her parents told us that the house would be in her name only, and that they expected us to sign a prenup to protect any (and only) pre-marriage assets \"just in case\". I was insulted that they thought I was after their money at all since I make more than she does anyway, and I ended up telling them that they can't call it a wedding present if they only give it to one person. I then told my fiancee I refused to live in a house that I don't own, and she knows exactly why. All three of them got very upset with me. So AITA?", "created_utc": 1679349174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wxah0/aita_for_telling_my_in_future_inlaws_that_its_not/", "score": 353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was pretty quiet about it ( my wife is a quiet person ) but later broke down crying about how much it made her feel like an equal in our marriage, and that I did so without her saying a word.\n\nStick to your guns, either it's a gift for both of you under both your names, or just buy your own house and fulfill that lifelong dream.", "NTA.  Gifts don't come with strings attached.  Their \"gift\" is putting you in your place.", "NTA. Honestly, I don't think they're terrible for wanting to give a nice gift but also ensure their investment goes to her in the event of a divorce. In addition, I'm sure prenups are much more common and less offensive in their world. That said, you've been dating for six years.  They know you, they presumably know your background, homeownership goals, etc. \n\nAlso, a potential solution/suggestion... Between the two of you, own TWO homes + get some sweet AirBnB income on one of them. You will have a much easier time saving up for the second while living in the first. ETA: just make sure your home is covered in the prenup, too.", "NTA. It\u2019s insulting that they wrapped it as a wedding gift and it speaks to their prejudice against you in my opinion. They could gift whatever they like to their daughter separately, and perhaps she can choose to rent it out for extra income that she can keep in her account. But it\u2019s definitely not a wedding present for both of you, and I wouldn\u2019t live there either when you clearly will have no rights to your home.", "Not get a prenuptial to protect yourself and tell your finance that you money will be separated moving forward", "This isn't really a judgment, but here's another perspective -\n\nOk, I actually don't think you are after their money.  Nothing you wrote indicates that's what they think.  I would assume they are giving their daughter a valuable asset.  It is clearly NOT a \"wedding gift\", but a gift for their daughter.  \n\nWhat would you do if your fiancee's parents went out and bought her a house today?  It's then premarital property in her name.  In your marriage, you get to live rent-free, mortgage-free, and spend money taking international vacations and wear designer clothes, if you like.  That's the \"gift.\"  If you divorce, you get equity and she keeps the house.  If she dies, you get the house.  Would you refuse to live in this house and call off the wedding?\n\nI get why its offensive, but you are not their child and they are still \"giving you\" something big, as long as you don't divorce their daughter. (Also, pre-nups can be rearranged to ensure equity and an increased cut if she is \"at fault\" somehow, e.g. she cheats in 10 years).  I actually don't think they are being awful.\n\nAnd by the way, they aren't \"fairly wealthy.\"  They seem VERY wealthy, based on your post! (Unless their parents also bought their houses and educations and all that stuff).", "NTA. Decline the gift and let them know that you want to save and buy a home of your own. They shouldn't have a problem with you wanting to earn a home that you will own.", "It isn't a wedding gift. It is a gift to their daughter.\n\nWhen people tell you who they are, believe them. They just told you, bro.\n\nNTA.", "NAH.  While I think it's nuts, I don't think it's an AH move to offer your child a house, and I don't think it's an AH move to want to protect the house you're buying.  But I also think it's totally reasonable for you to say \"no thanks\" to the gift, and find/buy a place with your spouse.  They obviously understand the value of property - they should understand your desire to have some of your own.", "NTA. That's not a wedding gift, it's a gift to their daughter. She can get you put on the title later, but it sounds like her parents would be the type to fight that.\n\nI also wouldn't sign a pre-nup without getting a lawyer look over it first. It sounds like they are protecting their daughter (which is fine of course), but you need to take care both of your interests, not just hers, not just yours.", "NTA.\n\nYou're correct in that the house isn't a wedding gift.  It's a gift to their daughter that they want you to have no possibility of being a part of.  If they continue to push the pre-nup, make sure you have your own lawyer that is different than theirs to ensure that you are protected.  They are only interested in protecting their daughter.\n\nYour gf understands your reasoning but still sides with her parents.  Her entitlement and greed is showing.  This situation with her parents continually giving to her and not including you is likely to continue after marriage.  And if she isn't willing to back you, is this what you want for your future.", "NTA. This is very weird. Home ownership is personal and a lot of people don't understand having it as a dream or a goal but I definitely do. It's not unreasonable that you want to own your own home. I also would be very concerned that this would be held over your head later (but that could just be my own family trauma talking, admittedly). \n\nOP- please get a lawyer to read through that prenup. Idk where you are, but in almost all places in the US premarital assets and inheritance are already considered non-marital property and I'm concerned they are trying to sneak something in there. Prenups are great tools but the law accomplishes what they are allegedly trying to do anyways. \n\nYou are right that it's not a wedding gift, it's a gift to their daughter. What she does with it is her business, but you need to make sure that you aren't getting tricked into something. And if  living in the house is a deal breaker for you, that's a conversation you need to have with your fiance *away* from her parents.", "NTA. That is not a *wedding* gift. That is a *bridal* gift, for the bride only. They aren't giving the house to you as a couple. They are giving her a house *and* making sure that you get NO equity in it whatsoever.\n\nThat IS insulting, and pretty damned obvious, too.\n\nThe prenup on its own isn't that bad, and I suppose it's common enough among people who have wealth...but as I understand it, this house would be a \"pre-marriage\" asset.\n\nOf course they are upset with you. You saw through scheme and called them on it. The fact that your fiancee is taking her parents' side in this disturbs me.", "NTA - A house is a wonderful present to buy but you are right, this is a present for their daughter and they expect you to live a life where you have no assets. I wouldn't be okay with that either. Daughter had her education handed to her, no matter how hard she studied she never had to work to pay tuition and that mindset is very privileged and different than many others have. However there is a benefit! No mortgage and you wouldn't ever have to pay fix-it bills!! But then you'll need to have a lease and possibly pay rent. Which is a shitty wedding gift to you.", "NTA. It's understandable that you would have a strong reaction to the situation. You grew up with a very different background than your fiancee, and you have a deep connection to your parents' dream of owning a house. It's admirable that you are taking steps to make that dream a reality. It's also understandable that you would want to be an equal partner in a house if you are going to live in it. It's good that you expressed your feelings and that you and your fiancee are having a conversation about it.", "That was smart of you to ask more questions about this gift. Did you get to explain your side? Not necessarily the part about your name not being on the title because that could be seen as a gold digger move, but the meaning of owning your house? \nI understand you feel insulted, but were you truly surprised by your future in-laws wanting a prenup? I\u2019m no wealthy at all, but I\u2019d expect a prenup if I was marrying into a rich family. \nI highly suggest you and your fianc\u00e9e get on the same page financially before getting married.\nNTA", "NTA.  I would feel exactly the same way. However maybe you could accept their offer for now on the grounds that you can then save a load more of your salary each month to eventually buy a place that belongs to you in a few years' time.  Then you can hand back your inlaws house or rent it out. But you'd need to get your fiancee to agree to that.", "They want everything rigged in her favor. I guess that\u2019s how they got extremely wealthy, because nice people usually don\u2019t. NTA", "NTA. But change the prenup. Don\u2019t agree to the \u2018future homes\u2019 bit. If you solely funded the next house, only put your name on it. Keep all the receipts. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird the arrangement they have. My family is considered pretty well off. The house we live in was a gift from my parents in my name only. That is just in case of divorce. Right now my husband and I are able to save a lot and we plan on buying a joint home together. I intend to will the house to our future children, rent it out till then or maybe even sell later on in life. \n\nSure, my husband\u2019s name is not on it but we make all our decisions together and I value his opinion. He has never felt entitled, upset or any type of way about it. We are incredibly grateful to my parents and he\u2019s able to save money to put towards our dream house in the future. With the money we save now we could probably get a bigger house, more land etc\n\nEdit to add: My husband too signed a prenup prepared by our family\u2019s lawyer. He hired a lawyer to look it over and advise, not surprisingly they found no fault in it. The prenup is to protect us both. Not to screw the other over. The prenup only existed to protect ancestral property / land from my side of the family etc", "NTA. Get a good lawyer to look over the prenup. As you describe it, it seems problematic and like it will start your marriage off on a bad foot.\n1. Are you expected to pay taxes or maintenance costs on this property that you don\u2019t own? Seems like a disincentive for you to contribute to maintenance costs. Will you and your wife keep separate finances to ensure that you are not financially responsible for the upkeep of the house? Or will her parents provide a trust to cover these costs? Will you pay rent?\n\n2. What happens if, as a couple, you make changes to this house that increase its value? How would an increase in value from material changes to the house be dealt with in the case you divorce?\n\n3. What if you and your wife chose to move and your wife chooses to sell the house? If she uses the proceeds to buy a new house (maybe combined with your money for a nicer house), would you co-own it?\n\n3. Will your pre-marital assets also be included in the prenup? That nest egg you\u2019ve been saving should be protected to make sure your arse is covered in case of divorce. I would be looking for protection of retirement accounts/company shares/etc\u2026 as well.\n\nHaving a prenup is a good idea if you and your partner are coming in with family assets, but the goal should be to protect everyone involved in good faith. The way your in-laws went about introducing the topic and their suggestion that this house would be a wedding gift for both partners is a jerk power move. Sure, they want to protect their daughter, but they can find a way to do that without being insulting.", "NTA. Based on your other comments, this seems less like a gift and more like a way to force you to have to accept the prenup they *conveniently* already had their lawyer draw up that\u2019s heavily weighted in their daughters favor. I\u2019d be insulted AF too.", "NTA It's not a gift to the couple. It's a gift to the daughter. Who could sell it and use it to purchase a house they both own if she wanted. Would be different if this was a family house that they wanted to keep in the family, but it's not that. A home is generally the biggest asset and wealth builder and this leaves him out of it.  I wouldn't accept.", "NAH both requests are reasonable. Her parents are looking out for their daughter and making sure to protect her. Personally, I believe all marriages should have a prenup regardless of financial status. You wanting to live in a home you are on the deed to is also completely reasonable. \n\nTake the house from her parents and rent it out and focus on getting a home for you and your fianc\u00e9e to buy together", "This \"gift\" is only meant for their daughter. You will not be able to build equity together as a married couple should. Your future is being dictated by the in-laws move. \n\nNTA", "NTA. However I would take the house live in the house and make sure the prenup includes a clause about you buying a house only you own. You can take the money you have put aside and buy your own house. That way you are protected as well. You will even be able to rent it out and get it paid off quicker.", "NTA", "NTA don\u2019t do it, unless you\u2019re on the deed you are not protected. Sounds like you and your fianc\u00e9 are not on the same page.", "NTA. Assets should be in both of your names for legal protections. As for the prenuptial, don't sign anything until you get your own lawyer to look over it!\n\nAnd by the way, don't undervalue yourself for the promotions and work that you do at your company. You don't really know the reasons why you got promotions unless they directly said it's because you're a male. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA it will forever be HER house if the three stooges get their way. You need to have a lawyer represent you & include post-marital earnings/assets in the prenup to make it fair since your value is in your future earnings. She can't get ownership of both the pre & post marital assets while you're only partially entitled to the post marital assets. Personally this would be a deal breaker for me if both of your names are not on the deed/title since you're right, this isn't a gift for you.\n\nIf you're still hell bent on marrying her I'd recommend 2 options... 1) rent the house to generate passive income that goes into a joint account & rent or buy a house together -or- 2) do not contribute or pay anything towards the maintenance or emergencies of her house & maintain separate finances (you can pay her token rent & have a formal rental agreement to cover you in the event they try something else that's shady as well).", "NTA and just my opinion but if you go ahead with this marriage I would, myself, retain a very good attorney that specializes in prenup\u2019s and keep your finances and assets separate throughout your entire marriage and anything bought together should be done through a contract. Your fianc\u00e9 will inherit from her parents and you will not have any claim to that, as it should be, but is seems they want to have access to everything of yours and you to have access to none of hers. I do not blame them for wanting to give their daughter something that is hers alone, I have done so for may daughter and her trust fund is not accessible to any person or spouse because her late father and I set it up that way. But that being said I would never expect her future spouse or partner to just give her half of everything they earn. Finances are a big thing that kills marriages as well as relationships so my view is to keep them separate. Sorry to tell you but your FIL seem very mercenary in the fact that they expect you to give everything and receive nothing.", "So, considering you make much more money than her, that's pretty much a prenup to say in case of a divorce she gets 100% of the house, and also a decent portion of what you make later? Yeah, I wouldn't accept that...", "Bro, RUN. Love can happen again but Debt/Court proceedings can stay forever. NTA", "NTA\n\nDon't marry her with pre-nup like this. Especially since you earn more and your money will go on maintenance of property you will never own.", ">I'll be the first to admit that this is completely undeserved and I've benefitted from a lot of luck and definitely some sexism as well, since we work in a male-dominated field.\n\nI already had a hard time taking you seriously up to that point but it completly stopped once I read this paragraph.\n\nThe whole posts screams \"I am about to say something really horrible but please here me out and here are some other things that make up for it\".If you are completly undeserving of your career and even only gotten your position through sexism then please resign immediatly and call the police in yourself for defrauding your company.\n\nIn all seriousness, this is a horrible attitude that people have, stop trying to bash yourself down with things you don't mean anyways just so that people might have more sympathy for you.\n\nI will say ultimately it is NAH for me.\n\nI agree that their actions can be hurtful and seem like they don't accept you but if you are not after her money anyways why would it even bother you. You refuse to live in a house you don't own, then just buy half of the house from your wife. You are making your life harder than it needs to be by stinging to arbitrary rules that you set for yourself and by being hurt by things that don't matter. Yes, it can technically not be called a wedding gift, but you and your wife still have a free house to use as you please. As somebody with your background don't you see how insulting your entire attitude is towards people that have it worse?You are getting married to a millionaire, make a huge income that you claim to not even deserve and achieved all that while under 30 and coming from a dirt poor family. Yet you are heartbroken because the free house you get is not in your name.Does that help you see how you sound?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Last thing to add is that I agree that the prenup sounds fishy, if you agree to one then have it written by a lawyer that you and your future wife pick out together.", " NTA\n\nShe\u2019s going to have her cake and eat it too! She gets the gift house, plus any house you buy during the marriage. Hell no!\n\nDo not live or have children in a house you do not own. You\u2019ll never be able to give any opinions about it. They will hang it over your head every time you have an argument. Basically they will force you to do their will as you have kids and the kids have a paid house to live at. If your wife refused to move out,m, what are you going to do? Divorce her and have weekend visitation with the kids?

If they were going to just gift their child a house, they should have just given it to her without you being there.

Check with an estate planning attorney about your rights regarding separate property acquired during marriage and obviously have that prenup reviewed. \n\nThey're giving *their daughter* a wedding gift and if it's paid off,  you'd be stupid not to live in it. Save up and give your wife the option of selling *her* house and applying all or some of the proceeds to *our marital home*, or keeping it a her separate property, which she maintains from her own funds while also contributing to your joint household in whatever ways you both deem fair.\n\nFor wealthy people,  marriage is a transaction even when it's a marriage for love.

I don't think you should be offended here but I understand why you are. \n\nAn alternative option is they buy the house and place it in a trust that grants their daughter the right to live in it and becomes her separate property upon their death, or skips her altogether and goes to your future children,  thereby removing the marital property issue altogether.\n\nThere are lots of creative ways to work this out and I would encourage you to go into this with an open mind (and your own lawyer) *because* you don't have experience with this level of wealth.

I understand your feelings about this. If I had a child I was gifting a house I would want the exact same clause though. I also understand how you're not comfortable with her having equal access after you get married.

Most marriages end in divorce so while it's not very romantic, the concern isn't unwarranted. Life is long and hard and people grow apart more often than not.

You make good money and you're about to live in a house that you don't have to pay any mortgage on, rent free. This will save you so much money that you can invest elsewhere!

I was an immigrant who moved here when I was 6, and we were definitely struggling a lot. My parents worked extremely hard to provide for me and siblings, and they always prioritized our education over everything. My dad always told me it was his dream to live in a house that he owned, since we'd always rented, but he couldn't save up enough since we were renting in expensive areas with good schools. Unfortunately, both of my parents passed away before being able to realize that dream. My dad passed away when I was 17 and my mom passed away almost 3 years ago due to covid.\n\nMy fiancee grew up fairly wealthy. Like private schools, designer clothes, 3-4 international vacations per year flying first or business class the whole way. I was able to attend college thanks to student loans, scholarships, and part-time jobs, which delayed my graduation a bit, while her parents were able to fairly easily cover all expenses themselves. However, I'm the last person to say that my fiancee hasn't earned everything she's gotten. She's an extremely intelligent person, and besides funding her education, her parents are in no way responsible for her accomplishments.\n\nMy fiancee and I met 6 years ago when we started working at the same company, in the same position, at the same time, after graduating from college. We hit it off almost instantly and it didn't take long for us to start dating. Both of us still work at the company, however I've progressed through the career ladder a bit more quickly than she has and now make just over twice what she does. I'll be the first to admit that this is completely undeserved and I've benefitted from a lot of luck and definitely some sexism as well, since we work in a male-dominated field. Still, that has allowed me to aggressively attack my student loans, and once they were payed off, I put that into saving up for a down payment on a house as a way to fulfill my parents dreams.\n\nI proposed about 6 months, and things have been great so far. However, this past weekend, we were at her family's house, when her parents told us that for a wedding present, they were going to give us a house. My fiancee was overjoyed, and although I was also happy, I wanted to know the details as well. Pretty quickly, her parents told us that the house would be in her name only, and that they expected us to sign a prenup to protect any (and only) pre-marriage assets \"just in case\". I was insulted that they thought I was after their money at all since I make more than she does anyway, and I ended up telling them that they can't call it a wedding present if they only give it to one person. I then told my fiancee I refused to live in a house that I don't own, and she knows exactly why. All three of them got very upset with me.

Get some couples counseling and the simple fact is that the house isn\u2019t necessary for you two to live.  She is upset that you are refusing to her a nice gesture from her parents but you don\u2019t have any anymore.  \n\nYou should also talk to her father and ask him to coffee just you two.  I would first apologize to him by saying that you would like to explain your position first and that you don\u2019t want this hurting your relationship with her or her parents.\n\nHonestly I think talking to father or mother one on one would be more productive since they offered the gift.

This way you still benefit from living in a paid off house but also have essentially what you would have put into equity if you leave the marriage. \n\nIf they disagree with this then don't sign the prenuptial agreement.
