{"id": 12783, "submission_id": "11wxah0", "title": "AITA for telling my in future in-laws that it's not a wedding gift unless it's given to both people and telling my fiancee I don't want to live in a house I don't own?", "selftext": "My fiancee \\[27F\\] and I \\[29M\\] grew up very differently. I was an immigrant who moved here when I was 6, and we were definitely struggling a lot. My parents worked extremely hard to provide for me and siblings, and they always prioritized our education over everything. My dad always told me it was his dream to live in a house that he owned, since we'd always rented, but he couldn't save up enough since we were renting in expensive areas with good schools. Unfortunately, both of my parents passed away before being able to realize that dream. My dad passed away when I was 17 and my mom passed away almost 3 years ago due to covid.\n\nMy fiancee grew up fairly wealthy. Like private schools, designer clothes, 3-4 international vacations per year flying first or business class the whole way. I was able to attend college thanks to student loans, scholarships, and part-time jobs, which delayed my graduation a bit, while her parents were able to fairly easily cover all expenses themselves. However, I'm the last person to say that my fiancee hasn't earned everything she's gotten. She's an extremely intelligent person, and besides funding her education, her parents are in no way responsible for her accomplishments.\n\nMy fiancee and I met 6 years ago when we started working at the same company, in the same position, at the same time, after graduating from college. We hit it off almost instantly and it didn't take long for us to start dating. Both of us still work at the company, however I've progressed through the career ladder a bit more quickly than she has and now make just over twice what she does. I'll be the first to admit that this is completely undeserved and I've benefitted from a lot of luck and definitely some sexism as well, since we work in a male-dominated field. Still, that has allowed me to aggressively attack my student loans, and once they were payed off, I put that into saving up for a down payment on a house as a way to fulfill my parents dreams.\n\nI proposed about 6 months, and things have been great so far. However, this past weekend, we were at her family's house, when her parents told us that for a wedding present, they were going to give us a house. My fiancee was overjoyed, and although I was also happy, I wanted to know the details as well. Pretty quickly, her parents told us that the house would be in her name only, and that they expected us to sign a prenup to protect any (and only) pre-marriage assets \"just in case\". I was insulted that they thought I was after their money at all since I make more than she does anyway, and I ended up telling them that they can't call it a wedding present if they only give it to one person. I then told my fiancee I refused to live in a house that I don't own, and she knows exactly why. All three of them got very upset with me. So AITA?\n\n**Edit/Update:** So I was requested to add some information that I included in the comments into my post, and I also just had a long conversation with my fiancee and my in-laws, so I have a small update to share as well.\n\nHere's the info from the comments: \n\n>The hilarious part of the whole prenup conversation was that they basically said that they expected the prenup to only cover premarital and inherited assets. They said they would absolutely refuse to accept any clauses that include future assets. So if I want to own a home where only my name is on the title, I have to purchase it before the marriage and also make sure to never use any of my wife's money to pay the mortgage or anything. Apparently they already had their lawyer write the whole thing up, but wanted to give me a heads-up so I can retain my own lawyer to review it. I have a suspicion that any lawyer is going to think it's massively unfair just base on how they've described it, and I'm assuming that they think I'll just get a cheap lawyer because of my upbringing. Admittedly, I don't know any better, so this is kind of difficult for me to determine what's fair and isn't fair here, but it doesn't seem fair to me.  \n>  \n>Besides that though, it's also just a personal thing. I want to live in a house that I own. Not them. Not my wife alone. I'm happy to live in a home that both my wife and I own, but not one she owns on her own. I don't someone else living in the home that I own. I want to live in it myself.\n\nI also should mention that currently, my fianc\u00e9e and I share our finances. She makes about 120k use and I make about 250k usd. We split things according to income, so I pay around two-thirds and she pays around one-third. Based on our conversations, my fiancee and I both expected this arrangement to continue after marriage.\n\nAs for the update, well I'll start with my fiancee's older sister \\[29F if it's relevant\\] calling me out of the blue a few hours ago to tell me that her parents did not ask her husband to sign a prenup before they got married. Both of my fiancee's sisters and my fiancee's BIL were at the dinner where her parents talked about the house, so they both heard the whole conversation. My fiancee's sister thought I deserved to know. My fiancee's BIL comes from a well-off family as well, but I don't know how well-off or whether they are on the same level as my fiancee's family or just upper middle class. Their wedding was pretty extravagant. My fianc\u00e9e's family is white and American, as is the BIL. I am Pakistani. I don't believe her parents are racist, but it seemed like this information was important according to the comments.\n\nAnyway, about 3 hours ago, my fiancee finally came home. She had stayed at her parent's house because we'd gotten into quite the argument. I was expecting her to continue the argument, but she actually came and apologized straight away. Apparently her younger sister \\[22F\\] chewed her out after I left her parent's house. She really laid into my fiancee on how she was being inconsiderate because everyone knew how important owning my home was to me. She also said that her parents weren't treating me right, or equally. That made my fiancee see my side, as she said, but she was too embarrassed, which is why she didn't come home last night. If you can't tell, I'm a huge fan of my fiancee's little sister right now. She's always been a sort of no-nonsense firecracker type of girl, while my fiancee is a bit of a people pleaser and definitely a Daddy's girl, and she's kind of always vying for her father's approval. My fianc\u00e9e has even said she knows she needs to work through that before we get married. I'm going to buy her sister a cupcake.\n\nThen showed her the post and she got pretty uncomfortable reading a lot of the comments, especially the ones saying that she doesn't care about me. She also got really uncomfortable when she read the comments about her parents being racist. I pressed on that a bit and she went on to mention that they've never been overtly racist, but they did make comments when we first started dating about being concerned about future, specifically about our children looking different and being treated poorly by her family. They asked her many times if she was sure about me. Like I said, I don't believe they're racist, but I do understand that they probably have some biases. This was also the case when they said they didn't want to do any traditional Pakistani events for the wedding. That was fine for me anyway, so I didn't really care, but now it makes me think a bit.\n\nI explained to her how I was feeling like I was going into this as an unequal partner, and she absolutely agreed that it wasn't fair. She even said she was going to tell her parents that she was going to refuse to sign the prenup. I told her to slow down, because she was going between extremes. I told her that we still needed to get the prenup because her family was already having difficulty accepting me and this was going to make it worse. However, I told her that under no circumstances was I signing anything her parents had a part in drafting, and that we would each retain our own lawyers outside of her parents' influence and get something that is fair and equitable. She agreed.\n\nWe then talked about the house, and she said she was going to tell her parents that she wasn't going to accept unless both of our names were on it. I told her to slow down again, and I got her to agree to me paying for a quarter of it. My initial proposal was to pay half, but she said that what I said about it being a wedding present so it should be for both of us was true. So we came to the agreement that we would each get half ownership of the house, with her parents paying for 75% of it and me using the money I have saved plus a small mortgage for the other 25%. Both of our names will be on the title.\n\nWe then called her parents together and told them our plan. They grumbled about it a bit initially, especially because her dad was still upset that I had been so ungrateful, but eventually, we were able to talk it through, and they agreed to the plan. I doubt that this is the last I hear about this, but at least for now, it seems like the situation is mostly resolved.", "created_utc": 1679349174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wxah0/aita_for_telling_my_in_future_inlaws_that_its_not/", "score": 3406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Gifts don't come with strings attached.  Their \"gift\" is putting you in your place.", "NTA. Honestly, I don't think they're terrible for wanting to give a nice gift but also ensure their investment goes to her in the event of a divorce. In addition, I'm sure prenups are much more common and less offensive in their world. That said, you've been dating for six years.  They know you, they presumably know your background, homeownership goals, etc. \n\nAlso, a potential solution/suggestion... Between the two of you, own TWO homes + get some sweet AirBnB income on one of them. You will have a much easier time saving up for the second while living in the first.

They could gift whatever they like to their daughter separately, and perhaps she can choose to rent it out for extra income that she can keep in her account.

Nothing you wrote indicates that's what they think.  I would assume they are giving their daughter a valuable asset.  It is clearly NOT a \"wedding gift\", but a gift for their daughter.  \n\nWhat would you do if your fiancee's parents went out and bought her a house today?  It's then premarital property in her name.  In your marriage, you get to live rent-free, mortgage-free, and spend money taking international vacations and wear designer clothes, if you like.  That's the \"gift.\"  If you divorce, you get equity and she keeps the house.  If she dies, you get the house.  Would you refuse to live in this house and call off the wedding?\n\nI get why its offensive, but you are not their child and they are still \"giving you\" something big, as long as you don't divorce their daughter. (Also, pre-nups can be rearranged to ensure equity and an increased cut if she is \"at fault\" somehow, e.g. she cheats in 10 years).  I actually don't think they are being awful.\n\nAnd by the way, they aren't \"fairly wealthy.\"  They seem VERY wealthy, based on your post!

While I think it's nuts, I don't think it's an AH move to offer your child a house, and I don't think it's an AH move to want to protect the house you're buying.

They obviously understand the value of property - they should understand your desire to have some of your own.", "NTA. That's not a wedding gift, it's a gift to their daughter.

It sounds like they are protecting their daughter (which is fine of course), but you need to take care both of your interests, not just hers, not just yours.", "NTA.\n\nYou're correct in that the house isn't a wedding gift.  It's a gift to their daughter that they want you to have no possibility of being a part of.  If they continue to push the pre-nup, make sure you have your own lawyer that is different than theirs to ensure that you are protected.  They are only interested in protecting their daughter.\n\nYour gf understands your reasoning but still sides with her parents.  Her entitlement and greed is showing.

Home ownership is personal and a lot of people don't understand having it as a dream or a goal but I definitely do. It's not unreasonable that you want to own your own home. I also would be very concerned that this would be held over your head later (but that could just be my own family trauma talking, admittedly). \n\nOP- please get a lawyer to read through that prenup. Idk where you are, but in almost all places in the US premarital assets and inheritance are already considered non-marital property and I'm concerned they are trying to sneak something in there. Prenups are great tools but the law accomplishes what they are allegedly trying to do anyways. \n\nYou are right that it's not a wedding gift, it's a gift to their daughter.

That is a *bridal* gift, for the bride only. They aren't giving the house to you as a couple. They are giving her a house *and* making sure that you get NO equity in it whatsoever.\n\nThat IS insulting, and pretty damned obvious, too.\n\nThe prenup on its own isn't that bad, and I suppose it's common enough among people who have wealth...but as I understand it, this house would be a \"pre-marriage\" asset.\n\nOf course they are upset with you.

I wouldn't be okay with that either. Daughter had her education handed to her, no matter how hard she studied she never had to work to pay tuition and that mindset is very privileged and different than many others have.

It's understandable that you would have a strong reaction to the situation. You grew up with a very different background than your fiancee, and you have a deep connection to your parents' dream of owning a house.

It's good that you expressed your feelings and that you and your fiancee are having a conversation about it.", "That was smart of you to ask more questions about this gift.

I would feel exactly the same way.

I guess that\u2019s how they got extremely wealthy, because nice people usually don\u2019t. NTA", "NTA. But change the prenup. Don\u2019t agree to the \u2018future homes\u2019 bit. If you solely funded the next house, only put your name on it. Keep all the receipts. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird the arrangement they have. My family is considered pretty well off. The house we live in was a gift from my parents in my name only. That is just in case of divorce. Right now my husband and I are able to save a lot and we plan on buying a joint home together. I intend to will the house to our future children, rent it out till then or maybe even sell later on in life. \n\nSure, my husband\u2019s name is not on it but we make all our decisions together and I value his opinion. He has never felt entitled, upset or any type of way about it. We are incredibly grateful to my parents and he\u2019s able to save money to put towards our dream house in the future. With the money we save now we could probably get a bigger house, more land etc\n\nEdit to add: My husband too signed a prenup prepared by our family\u2019s lawyer. He hired a lawyer to look it over and advise, not surprisingly they found no fault in it. The prenup is to protect us both. Not to screw the other over. The prenup only existed to protect ancestral property / land from my side of the family etc", "NTA. Get a good lawyer to look over the prenup. As you describe it, it seems problematic and like it will start your marriage off on a bad foot.\n1. Are you expected to pay taxes or maintenance costs on this property that you don\u2019t own? Seems like a disincentive for you to contribute to maintenance costs. Will you and your wife keep separate finances to ensure that you are not financially responsible for the upkeep of the house? Or will her parents provide a trust to cover these costs? Will you pay rent?\n\n2. What happens if, as a couple, you make changes to this house that increase its value? How would an increase in value from material changes to the house be dealt with in the case you divorce?\n\n3. What if you and your wife chose to move and your wife chooses to sell the house? If she uses the proceeds to buy a new house (maybe combined with your money for a nicer house), would you co-own it?\n\n3. Will your pre-marital assets also be included in the prenup? That nest egg you\u2019ve been saving should be protected to make sure your arse is covered in case of divorce. I would be looking for protection of retirement accounts/company shares/etc\u2026 as well.\n\nHaving a prenup is a good idea if you and your partner are coming in with family assets, but the goal should be to protect everyone involved in good faith. The way your in-laws went about introducing the topic and their suggestion that this house would be a wedding gift for both partners is a jerk power move. Sure, they want to protect their daughter, but they can find a way to do that without being insulting.", "NTA. Based on your other comments, this seems less like a gift and more like a way to force you to have to accept the prenup they *conveniently* already had their lawyer draw up that\u2019s heavily weighted in their daughters favor. I\u2019d be insulted AF too.", "NTA It's not a gift to the couple. It's a gift to the daughter. Who could sell it and use it to purchase a house they both own if she wanted.

I wouldn't accept.", "NAH both requests are reasonable. Her parents are looking out for their daughter and making sure to protect her. Personally, I believe all marriages should have a prenup regardless of financial status.

Your fianc\u00e9 will inherit from her parents and you will not have any claim to that, as it should be, but is seems they want to have access to everything of yours and you to have access to none of hers. I do not blame them for wanting to give their daughter something that is hers alone, I have done so for may daughter and her trust fund is not accessible to any person or spouse because her late father and I set it up that way. But that being said I would never expect her future spouse or partner to just give her half of everything they earn. Finances are a big thing that kills marriages as well as relationships so my view is to keep them separate.

I was an immigrant who moved here when I was 6, and we were definitely struggling a lot. My parents worked extremely hard to provide for me and siblings, and they always prioritized our education over everything. My dad always told me it was his dream to live in a house that he owned, since we'd always rented, but he couldn't save up enough since we were renting in expensive areas with good schools. Unfortunately, both of my parents passed away before being able to realize that dream. My dad passed away when I was 17 and my mom passed away almost 3 years ago due to covid.\n\nMy fiancee grew up fairly wealthy. Like private schools, designer clothes, 3-4 international vacations per year flying first or business class the whole way. I was able to attend college thanks to student loans, scholarships, and part-time jobs, which delayed my graduation a bit, while her parents were able to fairly easily cover all expenses themselves. However, I'm the last person to say that my fiancee hasn't earned everything she's gotten. She's an extremely intelligent person, and besides funding her education, her parents are in no way responsible for her accomplishments.\n\nMy fiancee and I met 6 years ago when we started working at the same company, in the same position, at the same time, after graduating from college. We hit it off almost instantly and it didn't take long for us to start dating. Both of us still work at the company, however I've progressed through the career ladder a bit more quickly than she has and now make just over twice what she does. I'll be the first to admit that this is completely undeserved and I've benefitted from a lot of luck and definitely some sexism as well, since we work in a male-dominated field. Still, that has allowed me to aggressively attack my student loans, and once they were payed off, I put that into saving up for a down payment on a house as a way to fulfill my parents dreams.\n\nI proposed about 6 months, and things have been great so far. However, this past weekend, we were at her family's house, when her parents told us that for a wedding present, they were going to give us a house. My fiancee was overjoyed, and although I was also happy, I wanted to know the details as well. Pretty quickly, her parents told us that the house would be in her name only, and that they expected us to sign a prenup to protect any (and only) pre-marriage assets \"just in case\". I was insulted that they thought I was after their money at all since I make more than she does anyway, and I ended up telling them that they can't call it a wedding present if they only give it to one person. I then told my fiancee I refused to live in a house that I don't own, and she knows exactly why. All three of them got very upset with me.

Get some couples counseling and the simple fact is that the house isn\u2019t necessary for you two to live.  She is upset that you are refusing to her a nice gesture from her parents but you don\u2019t have any anymore.  \n\nYou should also talk to her father and ask him to coffee just you two.  I would first apologize to him by saying that you would like to explain your position first and that you don\u2019t want this hurting your relationship with her or her parents.\n\nHonestly I think talking to father or mother one on one would be more productive since they offered the gift.

The gifting of a house to only her isn\u2019t actually that big of a deal- they could easily accomplish that by setting up a trust, which would not require you to sign a prenup at all- but the interfering with your relationship is absolutely a problem.\n\nStop talking to them about finances or marriage plans. If they ask a question, demure. If they persist, let them know that their tendency to meddle makes you uncomfortable discussing such things with them, and so you will not be doing so. If your fianc\u00e9 wants a prenup, negotiate that with her- it needs to be signed by both people, and you can absolutely have provisions including your earnings. Or, you can simply say you\u2019re not comfortable with being forced into a prenup by her parents, and ask your fianc\u00e9 if she would prefer getting married without one, continuing as partnered but unmarried indefinitely, or breaking up. You could also say you\u2019re comfortable with the prenup as is, but would like to delay marriage for 5 years or so while you acquire property that is solely yours.\n\nRegardless, your partner\u2019s parents being involved in the decision making should be a dealbreaker.", "What does your fiance think?", "Who do they expect to cover maintenance and repair costs for this house?

Therefore, this is not a house you would want to live in.\n\nThis is a thing you and your fiancee should have been clear about before now though.

So she gets the full asset of a house and a half, and he gets half a house worth.\n\nHow is that fair?", "A lot of people, yourself included, are completely missing that this isnt really about the house itself. This is about the disrespect the parents showed towards him. Replace \u201chouse\u201d with any other gift and he would have had the same reaction.", "And half of everything he puts into savings will go to the wife in the divorce and she keeps the house and he doesn\u2019t accrue equity.

He would just have to pay child support if they broke up after having kids.", "But what is his concern? That the parents in law think he's after her money? That's indeed unlikely since he makes more than her. And financially, he's definitely not worse off if his wife owns a house, on the contrary. Even without owning it, he will benefit financially. I get that it's disappointing to not be gifted half a house, but it doesn't make the in-laws assholes.", "Because that\u2019s exactly how it works?

The purpose is that he gets the benefits of the house as long as they're married. \n\n\nFor the future thing I do think I agree the parents are overstepping with their leverage.

He will lose his right to a first-time homebuyer's mortgage (since first-time homebuyers are required to live in the house they purchase). And the huge disparity in income also means that his disposable income will be paying for every renovation, every expense, every tax bill, but he will have no veto power in the location of the house or when the in-laws come over.\n\nIn addition, if he accepts this, the in-laws will be emboldened to tell him what to do, when to come, how to spend their vacation, how to raise the children, etc. This is obviously a \"wedding gift\" that comes with strings attached. And I wouldn't be surprised if they made a huge deal of it during the actual wedding/reception, to let everyone know how generous they are. And if they will probably continue to make a big deal of it during every family function they're with them.\n\nNow, this is fine if someone is willing to accept that, but as it stands, the OP isn't willing to. And frankly, I don't blame him. The OP already has excellent income and excellent income potential. He doesn't need to do that.

A prenup is likely a good idea for any couple with significant pre and post marital assets, but the people who should be most directly involved in the prenup are the two people in the relationship and their lawyers, and it should be to the benefit of both parties. The fact that her parents drew up a prenup before talking to either of you (I presume/hope she didn't know about it either, because if she did, that's really shitty on her part) is really out of line, as is trying to dictate terms to you before you have even seen it or been able to retain a lawyer.\n\nYou desperately need to have a conversation with your fiancee about all of this independently. You say, \"They said they would absolutely refuse to accept any clauses that include future assets.\" Who are they to absolutely refuse anything? Your future in-laws aren't part of your marriage, and they shouldn't be part of your prenup. It's concerning if your fiancee doesn't have a problem with her parents issuing ultimatums to you on her behalf.\n\nAnd find a good lawyer and talk to them. Good prenups are written on behalf of two people who love each other and want the best for one another. You may even want to ask your fiancee to obtain her own lawyer who doesn't already have a conflict of interest due to representing her parents. It seems like there should be room for negotiation on a lot of these issues and possibly even some legal maneuvering that satisfies both your desire to have your name on a house while also protecting it as an asset in the event of a divorce.", "FWIW, I find this highly unlikely that a lawyer who is worth his salt actually drew this up or would expect it to stick.  One of the number one things that invalidate a prenup is a prenup so one sided that it is basically assumed the person was under duress signing it.  \n\nAlso, some prenups automatically get dissolved after a length of marriage.  For instance in California, if you live in that house for 10 years married it\u2019s communal property- regardless of what the prenup says. (Prenups are only valid for 10 years in CA, period.) \n\nThe way this really works is you take it to a lawyer, your lawyer says this bullshit, and puts in things that you want in there, they argue over it, until you get to something that is equitable to both of you.  If they don\u2019t want to go through that process, then you have cause for concern - but it\u2019s highly likely they are expecting you to because that\u2019s how all contracts work and any lawyer, even a cheap one, would see a prenup such as this was non-enforceable. \n\nOne thing you haven\u2019t mentioned is kids.  Do you and your wife plan on having kids?  Is she gonna be a stay at home mom?  That would impact any prenup as well.  \n\nIf I were you, I would call up your works legal services, add something in there about how you\u2019re buying your own house and want it to be a just you asset - and use the free house to save up as much as possible.

But there is also the flip side, where someone is refusing to fully acknowledge the extent of their privilege...  And that side usually comes with things like vocally supporting their new family member and all his work coming from his lower income background, while also clinging to their wallets tighter in his presence.", "Honestly, I come from a very wealthy family, and my husband and I had a prenup. The thing is that we already owned a home together. We thought about the fairest way to split it up since I was the one who paid the down payment, but he made more money that went to the mortgage. In the end, we just went 50/50.\n\nHowever, I had the prenup cover an ownership stake in my family's business. This was a big part of my inheritance and I didn't want him to have any voting power in how the business would be run in the case of our divorce. However, this was the only asset we agreed he had no legal claim to make. Everything else -- house, car, investments -- was 50/50. \n\nWe treated our respective salaries as one pool and so we treated any assets purchased from that pool as joint assets. Also, any dividends from that business were not part of the prenup. When it comes to everything in our marriage, we decided the best way to stay married is to be a team first. A financial strategy that tried to make everything \"fair\" was going to pit us against each other, and neither of us had any major concerns about the other's financial habits or responsibilities to warrant such protection.\n\nUltimately, it wasn't my parents that pushed this. It was me. Your fiance needs to tell her parents that whether or not you guys get a prenup and what is going to be covered in it is up to you two.

I pressed on that a bit and she went on to mention that they've never been overtly racist, but they did make comments when we first started dating about being concerned about future, specifically about our children looking different and being treated poorly by her family. They asked her many times if she was sure about me. Like I said, I don't believe they're racist, but I do understand that they probably have some biases.

However, regardless of how much of that identity you claim: you are a person of a color and your future in-law's behavior is alarming. And it's slightly disheartening to see you seemingly dismiss their behavior as simple biases when it is much more.

Your in-laws clearly had some reservations about you SIMPLY due to your race and socioeconomic status, I really don't understand how their attitude towards you and your somewhat acceptance of it can create a healthy relationship moving forward. \n\nEven if you somehow cannot come to terms with labeling the events as racist, at the very LEAST they're extremely disrespectful.
