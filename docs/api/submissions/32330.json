Parents can we uncomfortable telling their kids things like \"I'm too depressed to keep myself safe and need to be in the hospital\" so, although she said vacation, it's very unlikely that is what's actually happening. \n\nOnce she checks in, call the hospital and ask to speak to the social work department - it is their job to help the families of their patients access resources. The hospital also needs to truly understand how your mom is so that they can help her - if she is disabled by depression to the point where she can't clean, her meds and therapy regime need to be adjusted. If she can't properly care for your sister, she needs to be moved out of the home and the social workers can assist with that (depending on where you live, your sister and you might qualify for some money to get your own place, or your sister could be placed with a relative or friend so you can move out).\n\nNot putting a specific judgement because this isn't a situation where someone is an asshole, it's a situation where everyone involved needs help they aren't getting.", "Oh wow, there is so much wrong in ypur living situation :(\n\nFirst: as soon as possible get your own place.\n\nSecond: you are parentified to the max.\n\nThird: you guys seriously need some sort of social worker.

You have a real future and if you stay, they will continue to suck all your life away.\n\nTrust me as someone from a similar childhood, if I prioritized caring for my mother with similar tendencies over caring for myself, I would have had a disaster of a life. \n\nThe other thing is it sets a good example for your sister if she ever decides to turn her life around. It did the same for my younger brother, he was in his mid-20s, but he saw the difference of lifestyle and decided to get his act together. \n\nSince my mother didn\u2019t have us to support her anymore, she somewhat got her life together.

But your mother is incapable of doing it. A house with three people that no one cleans gets filthy in 3 days, that's just what happens. But it sounds like the funds you and your mom receive would pay for a cleaning service. I would call that an essential expense for your situation, as well as an exterminator once it's clean.  After that you'll want to keep the service weekly.\n\nOf course you resent your mother.  It's a terrible situation to have your mom incapable of caring for you or herself. It's OK to feel that.

Anger helps us survive difficult situations. \n\nFrom your mom\u2019s side, it sounds like she has a mental illness - psychiatric units won\u2019t just check you in for a break from life, there aren\u2019t enough beds. So this seems like a situation where she\u2019s genuinely unable to meet your needs.

You and your sister need to get full time jobs and start planning to get out as soon as possible.", "Your mother is not only the asshole in this situation, but a poor excuse for a human being. None of her problems are an excuse for the way she lives, which directly affects you and your sister. \nThere are people infinitely worse off than your mother that fuction better than her.

There are people who can basically function ( to some degree at least), but who have mental health issues that prevent them from doing the basic maintenance stuff to keep a house liveable. What you're describing certainly sounds like this. Whether it's from some form of ADHD or something else, it is clearly not something that she can fix on her own - but neither will it resolve without intense, professional in-home intervention. Of course that costs money, so I'm not sure how that would get paid for, butyour country sounds more generous than mine, maybe a therapist could prescribe a professional organizer to come work with her?\n\nI completely understand wanting to have a clean home, and wanting to help her, but also being at your wits end that nothing changes. It's normal to think that if we could just help someone get back to a baseline, they'd be able to take it from there -- but that's not going to work for someone who has mental health issues impairing the process. \n\nI think you lashed out a bit (understandably), but it seems you're doing your best with way more responsibility than you should have to deal with at your age. \n\nTL/DR: your mom does need professional help, but probably something ongoing/ in home. You are doing the best you can, and your feelings are valid.", "NTA.\n\nI won't sugarcoat. Your story has similarities with mine, when I was your age. I've been through it and can confirm it's possible to come out the other side in one piece & live a good, happy life where you are finally safe.\n\nI say this from my own experience: You and your sister are experiencing extreme child neglect, which is a kind of child abuse. This situation is untenable, physically and psychologically unsafe & unhealthy and will only get worse. Your sister is still a child, is self-medicating to cope & it sounds like she is being groomed. You aren't able to see the bigger picture just yet (how could you until you're out the other side - nobody would be able to when it's still happening to them).\n\nEven though you're 18 (full adult in my country), you're still a kid yourself and you both need (actually, you both DESERVE) an adult who will embrace and support you. It may not seem 'all that bad' to you right now. Quite frankly this is because - as a protective thing - coming to terms with just how fucked it is in this exact moment would overwhelm you and trip you up. You will need to come to terms with it, but there's plenty of time to work on that later. Right now you need to get out of your survival era.\n\nI'm sorry you are in this position but you need to:\n1. Get through exams (they are imminent), then\n2. Get yourself (AND sister if you can) out of there and into a better situation ASAP.\n3. Access therapy and ongoing support for yourself AND your sister.\n\nIf you're anything like me, I feel helpless if I don't have a plan (this stopped my being able to sleep/concentrate on study), so I'd start reaching out for the step 2 conversations whilst doing step 1.\n\nLeverage all resources available to you. For example, would your bf's family be okay with letting your sister live with them whilst you follow up on the living alone support from your school - even for a few weeks or months? His family sounds very supportive. Do you/they know anyone else that you/they trust who has a spare room? How about the families of your sister's friends? Can you ask them/your school's resources/social worker/a legal aid place to help you navigate the legal, rental, etc aspects of what you need to do? Potentially could you have your sister live with you once you find a place (I'm hesitant with this one because she needs someone to focus on her & work closely to get to the bottom of the reasons for her truancy and self-medication - and you're already having to parent yourself). You aren't alone in this experience, and it sounds like you have supports available - you just have to press the button and activate them.\n\nIt's scary now. Get through your exams, then sit down with the adult/s you know and trust and work out a proper game plan. Nobody will do this for you - if they were going to, they would have done it already. And maybe they don't know how to, without you being responsive and coming to the table. I'm sorry but this will fall on you. I'm sorry your mother has been failing you. I'm sorry her friends have been failing you (how could they not fucking know?!). I'm sorry your father has been failing you. I'm sorry you don't have a lot of family around you who will do right by you. I know you love your mother and feel bad but if she were to properly do the right thing by you, she would have reached out for help with raising 2 children a long time ago. I'm surprised that last year's hospital stay didn't prompt a social worker to work something out with her (or maybe I just expect too much). Does she even have a plan to make sure you're both okay during the time she's away? One does not just roll up to a mental hospital, you typically need psychiatric support to get in - so what the hell is your mother's doctor doing for you?! Your mother is old enough to fend for herself once you leave, she'll get over it. And if she doesn't, then that's her choice to make and does not reflect on you or on your sister.\n\nRemember this. Through all that you are about to embark on - not just your exams, but the challenges of navigating a world that will be different to the one you've been used to until now - please know you are not alone. You are a very bright, intelligent and capable young woman. You will get through this moment in time. You are worthy of being treated with love, kindness, empathy, respect, and common decency. It will get better, no matter how far away it may seem. You've got this. In fact, not only have you got this, you'll smash it out of the fucking park.", "Mom most certainly can get herself admitted.

It doesn\u2019t seem as though she is doing any proper parenting or household management.  NTA.  Your mom needs the reality check that you and your sister are much more responsible than she is.  There are plenty of jobs that people can do with mobility issues.  And her mental health doesn\u2019t seem to impede her social life whatsoever.  I am so sorry you and your sister have to live in this environment.  I hope you both are able to get out as soon as possible because it honestly seems like you\u2019re doing it on your own anyway.", "This sounds like a great, but overwhelming, opportunity for you. Personally, I started living on my own at a young age and anything I didn't know, I googled. Literally everything from what you need to sign a lease to how to set up a power bill is online.
