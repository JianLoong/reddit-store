Parents can we uncomfortable telling their kids things like \"I'm too depressed to keep myself safe and need to be in the hospital\" so, although she said vacation, it's very unlikely that is what's actually happening. \n\nOnce she checks in, call the hospital and ask to speak to the social work department - it is their job to help the families of their patients access resources. The hospital also needs to truly understand how your mom is so that they can help her - if she is disabled by depression to the point where she can't clean, her meds and therapy regime need to be adjusted. If she can't properly care for your sister, she needs to be moved out of the home and the social workers can assist with that (depending on where you live, your sister and you might qualify for some money to get your own place, or your sister could be placed with a relative or friend so you can move out).\n\nNot putting a specific judgement because this isn't a situation where someone is an asshole, it's a situation where everyone involved needs help they aren't getting.", "Oh wow, there is so much wrong in ypur living situation :(\n\nFirst: as soon as possible get your own place.\n\nSecond: you are parentified to the max.\n\nThird: you guys seriously need some sort of social worker.

You have a real future and if you stay, they will continue to suck all your life away.\n\nTrust me as someone from a similar childhood, if I prioritized caring for my mother with similar tendencies over caring for myself, I would have had a disaster of a life. \n\nThe other thing is it sets a good example for your sister if she ever decides to turn her life around. It did the same for my younger brother, he was in his mid-20s, but he saw the difference of lifestyle and decided to get his act together. \n\nSince my mother didn\u2019t have us to support her anymore, she somewhat got her life together.

But your mother is incapable of doing it. A house with three people that no one cleans gets filthy in 3 days, that's just what happens. But it sounds like the funds you and your mom receive would pay for a cleaning service. I would call that an essential expense for your situation, as well as an exterminator once it's clean.  After that you'll want to keep the service weekly.\n\nOf course you resent your mother.  It's a terrible situation to have your mom incapable of caring for you or herself. It's OK to feel that.

And by that point we were only intimate once every 60-90 days or so and she would tell me it was because I never did anything right. By the end of the relationship My self esteem was shot.  I would have been better off financially and mentally if I had lived on my own and just given my extra money to a random girl who just smiled at me and was thankful  for what I was giving her. Literally paying a woman for  just telling me that I was a good person for trying to help, would have been an improvement in my life at the time. At the time I was giving everything I could and was made to feel bad for it not being enough to satisfy her tastes.  \n\nAfter she replaced me with a richer (his rich parents gave him money every month) guy, I really only started to improve when a younger woman befriended me and became my girlfriend. she was 2 months from her 18th birthday, and I was 20 at the time. It was the appreciative attitude and kindness towards me that pulled me out of the rut enough to start working on reversing the damage done to me before.   \n\n\nWe had a 7 year relationship. It wasn't a perfect relationship. But Its not like either of us was trying to take advantage of the other. \n\nWhere I live 16 is the age of consent. So even if she was sleeping with him, unless he was her teacher or something, there would be nothing \"wrong\" with it. Especially if it was the same boy every time. If it was a different boy every time it would be a much different story, because although prostitution isn't illegal, soliciting a minor is a big deal.  \n\n\n You should ask if you can meet this boy.  He might just be a good guy in love with your sister and mortified of the stories she tells him of her living situation and her mother. it doesn't have to be shady just because he's a couple years older. For many men providing for a girlfriend feels pretty good. The wiring in our brains directly rewards us for providing for a woman who treats us with kindness and respect regardless of whether we are sexually intimate with her.    \n\n\nI wonder if he even knows that she's using the money to buy drugs. I wonder if he even knows that she is skipping so much school. He could be paying your sister for sex, or he could be a really decent guy who is honestly trying to help. You won't know until you meet him or your sister tells you more.    \n\n\nYour sister skipping school and doing drugs to forget her home life is a pretty normal reaction for someone in your living situation. it needs to be nipped in the bud so that it doesn't become worse, but your living situations are pretty bleak at the moment.  You should find out if therapy is something that could be covered with the government benefits  for you and your sister, since living with your mother in the state that she has been, is traumatic. y'all have been robbed of many normal experiences.  Children shouldn't have to be responsible for their parents at your age.", "[removed]", ">I can receive a monthly fee of around 1.2k through a government organisation, but then i'd be forced to move out, my scholarship money would be taken from my mom and given to me instead.

It really sucks that your mum isn't capable of being a parent to you, but she's just not. She has issues that are much too big for you to handle, and they're not yours to handle in the first place. You deserve *and need* to have a proper place to live.\n\nIf possible, it would be really great if you could get authorities of some kinds to look after your sister as well.

And you can also work with a social worker to understand what additional help you may qualify for.  \n\nIn this case, you may have to put your oxygen mask on first before assisting anyone else.

It has taken years for me to be able to create healthy boundaries and give myself my own space, recognize my own bandwidth and stop sacrificing for them. \n\nIt\u2019s scary letting go of those personal responsibility feelings.

If you move out and leave her on her own, she very well may spiral\u2026 but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. There are empirically supported treatments for social anxiety, and it doesn\u2019t sound like your mom is working through any of them right now. Spiralling might motivate her to actually work on her mental health problems.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to comment because I\u2019m a psychologist and I also grew up with an emotionally manipulative mother. Your mom is really sick and it\u2019s highly unlikely that she\u2019s going to get better any time soon. The stint in the mental health hospital won\u2019t help because she\u2019s treating it like a vacation instead of an opportunity to improve her mental health. You can\u2019t fix your mom. Focus on protecting yourself and see if you can access counselling through your school - what you\u2019ve been through is neglect and it\u2019s a form of trauma. Sometimes neglect can have even worse effects than sexual abuse, that\u2019s how damaging it is. \n\nGood luck OP", "You cannot keep your mother from spiraling. It is not your responsibility to keep her functional, ok? I\u2019m a retired psychologist and I\u2019m going to get real with you: you cannot be responsible for your mother\u2019s choices and you\u2019re probably enabling some of her bad choices simply by being reliable and responsible. In other words, the things you do to make your life reasonable also allow your mom to continue as-is. You feeling responsible for your sister allows your mom to let go of that responsibility. You living there means she can \u201cgo on vacation\u201d whenever she wants and you\u2019ll take care of things. You are setting yourself on fire to keep your undeserving mother warm, and you don\u2019t even really feel the heat because you\u2019re so far in. NTA, but it\u2019s time to take care of you."]}
