She's told her parents this but they insist it's not an issue.\n\nYour inlaws are correct - it\u2019s not an issue because their dog will not be coming into your house.\n\nNTA - you are under no obligation to let someone else\u2019s pet into your house, particularly one that\u2019s not housebroken. \n\nMy guess is that they will say they have made arrangements for the dog, but plans will have suddenly fallen through at the last minute, forcing them to bring their dog along. I suggest you get a written quote for having your carpets professionally cleaned. If they show up with the dog, they can either (1) turn around and go home, or (2) pay you for the carpet cleaning in advance.", "NTA. You\u2019re wife is though she should set up boundaries. \nIt are her parents and she should not allow the dog inside the house otherwise she can deal with the replacements of everything that the dog peed on including changing the carpet herself.", "Absolutely NTA but I strongly urge you to set up a game plan and make sure your spouse is on board.\n\nAs in, when they show up with Cujo, *as they probably will* you don't let them in. Not in the garage, not in the yard, not just for a second. Have a list of kennels printed out and let them deal.", "NTA.  Set the boundary that they can kennel their dog or leave it with pet sitters or whatever else they want to do but the dog won\u2019t be roaming freely at your house.  My dogs are well housetrained and even then we would have on occasional incident which is why we don\u2019t have carpet.  I would never expect my dogs to have free rain at others.  If they don\u2019t like it they can leave.", "NTA\n\n> I believe my inlaws don't realize the problem \n\n#LIKE HELL THEY DIDN'T", "NTA - My sisters dog is the same and coming for the holidays. She is to bring a carrier, playpen, a tarp, and plenty of dog pee pads as well as dog diapers. The dog will spend the majority of the time in my tiled laundry room. \n\nFor the record: I have two German Shepherds that are fully trained and have free roam of my home. She failed to train her 5lb dog. This is not my fault.", "NTA\n\nWe have had older dogs with incontinence problems.\n\nDoggy diapers.  Can't be in the house without them.", "NTA.   No no no no no no no.   No dogs in the house that aren't housebroken.   It beggar's belief that there is actually a conflict here; who (other than your in-laws and possibly your husband) thinks that their dog peeing in someone else's home - yours - is actually okay?", "\"Hi, just wanted to check that you remembered that the dog is not allowed in the house. Did you decide to get a dog sitter and leave it at home or are you planning on leaving it in the garage while you're here?\"\n\nNTA, and if they say that the dog should be allowed to come in because \"it isn't an issue,\" just respond, \"Regardless, we are not currently having dogs inside our home, so are you leaving it with a dog sitter or leaving it in the garage?\"", "NTA. Do they have no sense of smell? \ud83e\udd22 \nIt\u2019s likely too late to find a dog sitter or kennel with space over the holidays even if they agreed. Stipulate the dog does not come inside, if it does and inevitably pees they clean it up AND they pay for professional carpet cleaning after they\u2019ve left.", "NTA \n\nYour house, your rules. The kennel does not need to be in the garage does it?\n\nI would not trust the inlaws to abide by your rules of keeping the dog crated.", "100% NTA. It's fine if they want to let the dog wreck their house. It's not fine for it to wreck yours. If they insist on having it in the house, it goes in a crate, end of discussion.", "Unless they want to pay for the shampooing, NTA.", "They make dog diapers!", "As a dog owner this actually gives me the boak just reading it. I would absolutely not tolerate a dog peeing all over my house, or anyone who thinks it's ok for a dog to do so. NTA.", "NTA. Who lets a dog pee all over their house yet doesn't notice it?! Do they even have noses?!", "NTA You have a wife problem. You may have no choice but to issue an ultimatum to her.", "NTA. Oh, they know the problem, they just don't care. Tell them they either leave the dog or go to a hotel.", "Of course NTA. You need to house a serious convo with your spouse about why they can't communicate effectively with their parents and set clear boundaries. Either that or document the dog peeing in your house and sue them for damages", "NTA. Tell them they owe you a $300 pet deposit if they\u2019re bringing it in. At the end of the day, your house your rules.", "NTA if they insist on bringing the dog let them know they will be responsible for the professional cleaning bills. Also, do you have a lot of carpet? Can you put up doggy gates? Any time the dog pees, make them immediately clean it up. Your spouse definitely needs to back you up. She might have grown up with this kind of thing and could be desensitized to it (speculation).", "NTA. They are rude and selfish.", "NTA: What a way to enjoy the holiday. If you can't win the battle make the dog wear diapers the whole time.", "NTA\n\nI wish you luck\u2026have the shampoo bill for the last visit handy. They don\u2019t see this as an issue because they either don\u2019t smell it/see it or are in denial. Doesn\u2019t matter, you know what happened and are allowed to decide what animals you invite into your home.\n\nYour spouse needs to be on the same page and let them know what they plan is if they show up with the dog. \n\nOh, here is a local kennel that will take your dog.\n\nOr dog is only allowed in the garage. I wouldn\u2019t trust this or a crating in the house.\n\nand here is the cost per room if we need to clean carpet, furniture. You will be paying it.\n\nMaybe buy some doggy diapers that can be returned if the dog ends up in the house\u2026.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re aware but they don\u2019t care. Yes, and this is a big if, you want to relent tell them the dog has to be created at all times unless outside. As well as they must clean up after their dog at all times..", "NTA.   \n\nCan you call her the night before and ask her what plans she made  for the dog?\nThen she can't show up with dog in her arms with stupid excuses.", "NTA\nIf their dog isn't house-trained, it doesn't need to be in your house.", "NTA.

Not toilet training a dog is your choice, but you don\u2019t get to take it to someone\u2019s house and mess up thr place. \nFor the last year of his life my geriatric cocker lost bladder control due to dementia so I wouldn\u2019t take him anywhere except for my parents and brothers houses because they wanted to see him and accepted he would pee. Needless to say I would clean up after him immediately and use enzyme sprays to get rid of the smell", "Maybe it's time to make reservations for boarding at the local kennel or veterinarian's office. That way they can go and visit their pup everyday and know that he is okay. But don't wait until they just show up with the dog to stay directly to them (not through your wife) that you are unable to accommodate their dog any longer.", "NTA. If their dog peeing inside isn\u2019t an issue, their dog can pee in their home for Christmas.", "NTA your wife & you need to get on the same page. If she invites that dog SHE or the parents buy and use an enzymd cleaner to clean up all the messes! \n\nOrder a blacklight now. Show your spouse your carpet before the dog. Show your inlaws your new blacklight and enzyme cleaner that they can clean up any & all things that glow.... or the f-ing dog can stay outside/ in a crate! Make a big deal of showing them each and every dribble & doing hourly pee checks. Normally I would say that is being an a-hole but bringing your dog to a home where it is not welcome is some major a-hole behavior!\n\nEdit: buy them a dog crate for Christmas to keep the dog in while the dog is inside if there is one glowing spot on your carpet. \n\nHonestly though I would just tell them to turn right back around with their dog. I would not let them enter the home to start with.", "Info needed: What is the weather like where you live? I just ask because having a dog stay in a garage when it is freezing outside is cruel.

You can buy disposable ones at a bigger pet store (PetSmart, etc.)", "NTA and those people are bad pet owners. If there\u2019s some medical reason the dog cannot hold it in, then there are doggy diapers (like when a dog is sick or old).

They said they don\u2019t want the dog in house period. Why should they allow dog in house just because they wouldn\u2019t have to pay for carpet cleaning.
