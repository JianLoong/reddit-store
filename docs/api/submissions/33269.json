My vote is ESH because your wife should be doing more too and not just lecturing you or making you the bad guy with food.

You don't have to feed her salads all day, but you can certainly by healthier options and teach her moderation.", "ESH except your daughter\n\nWhen under 18s get overweight, it is never their fault, and usually the direct fault of the parents. Both parents. You said your ex-wife feeds your daughter junk food. You also admitted to feeding your daughter loads of junk food. \n\nBoth you and your ex-wife should be helping your daughter get fit and healthy. It's a difficult line to tread because you don't want her getting into a habit of disordered eating either, so here's maybe some do's and don'ts that may work for you, in terms of helping your daughter- \n\nDo-\n- Talk to your ex-wife. Agree that when your daughter is staying with each of you, she will be eating 3 home-cooked healthy meals a day with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Get her involved in the cooking process with you if you can- it will help her prepare for making her own fresh meals as an adult.\n- Have her join a local sports club, or take up a personal sport such as running or gym. She can do any sport of her choosing. Just one sport, once a week. If she enjoys it, she may even want to do it more regularly.\n- Go on regular walks and do outdoor activities with her. Spend your time together in the outdoors and think of fun activities you can do to get moving together.\n\nDon't- \n- Eat a load of unhealthy snacks or takeaways in front of your daughter. She can't see it as being one rule for you and another for her.\n- Talk about the number on the scale. You can change your behaviours to help her get fit, without explicitly sharing with her that that's what you're doing. You don't have to say \"let's go for a hike to keep fit\". Instead try \"I've heard about this cool waterfall hike nearby, we should go together\" or something. Its really important that you don't centre the activity around weight loss when you suggest it to her. \n- Make her do any sport she doesn't enjoy- she tries tennis but then decides she hates it? That's ok, let her try out something else instead.\n\n\nThese are suggested bullet points. I am open to feedback from others on this. I'm a qualified secondary school teacher and have worked with teenagers for many years, but by no means am I a dietician or anything.\n\nI think overall the important thing is instilling healthier habits, without being too explicit about why. There is no need to say \"we're having vegetables for dinner because you're getting fat\" when you can just say \"I found a good-looking chow mein recipe online- you want to make it with me?\" Healthy doesn't have to mean salads and portion sizes. You can have well-cooked, delicious meals too.\n\nFinally, try and change your own habits, especially when she is around. From the post, it sounds like you order fast food somewhat regularly. If there is one thing I have learnt from working in education it is that children and teens learn so much more by subconsciously copying their parents, than they ever will by things you tell them. Monkey see, monkey do.", "Honestly it sounds like the parents have a bad relationship with food themselves and the kid learned their habits. Op, ETH, both of you and your ex honestly, her behaviour screams she'll cause her an eating disorder of the other end of the spectrum. All 3 of you need to book an appointment with a dietician and get professional advice, not trying to justify your carelessness with reddit. Your choices here will affect her for the rest of her life.\n\nAs for activity, exercise doesn't have to be boring. Go out for a walk in the park, adventure gym, leisure bike ride, heck even a Nintendo switch with a motion sports game. There are many things you can do that are more fun and honestly better for your health than machines at a gym. It can be a good father-daughter bonding activity too.", "YTA. Making your daughter eat salads is the wrong approach but so is getting fried chicken, pancakes and pizza. What your daughter needs is parents who bother to cook healthy, well balanced meals. The problem with you and your ex is that you only seem to feed this girl in extremes. She\u2019s going to end up with lifelong obesity problems related to yo to dieting as a result of poor parenting. If you\u2019re unsure where to start, please engage a registered dietician to help with meal planning.", "\"AITA for lying to my wife\"?  That's the event in this sequence that you are really wanting advice about?", "YTA. She weighs 220lbs and you decided to help by feeding her crap two nights running.

Diet doesn\u2019t mean not feeding her ! Why not a Caesar salad ? With chicken and tomatoes ? Why not cooking with her ? Why didn\u2019t you get to a library to chose receipe books with her to learn healthy receipes to make for and with her ? Why not going to a sport shop to buy easy exercices buy and a few accessories she could use in her bedroom or living-room ? Your daughter has a problem because her parents don\u2019t care. Your es is a problem too but she brought her to the doc, she wants to help. You even don\u2019t try", "ESH\n\nGet some outside help to properly support your daughter.  \n\nIt's really critical how you all move forward with this. Sounds like Mom's approach is more harmful than good.  Everyone's hyperfixation on her weight is not healthy.\n\nHaving a day or two with you like that isn't the worst thing in the world dad and I think it does speak to your love for her.  Balance is key though.\n\nFood issues are the worst and hardest to sort out. We literally have to eat to survive. Try to help her get ahead of that before this actually does become an issue for her.  Mom riding her is the biggest concern.  That criticism is harsh for a teen.  Cut it out!\n\nFried chicken to boring dressingless salads is way to big of a shift and restrictive eating routines like that can actually spike binge eating or her hiding food and eating.  Basically long of the short of it is that how you and your ex handle supporting your daughter could be what helps her establish a reasonable and healthy relationship with food or it quite literally can be the cause of some life long issues around food. \n\nBest to get some actual trained help.  Food doesnt have to taste awful to be good for us.  Exercise doesnt have to be grueling to have effect.\n\nDo some fun activities with her on weekend.  Try making new foods. Less carbs more protein more veg.  If she likes volume look at ways to increase volume with lower carbs/calories.  \n\nMake her foods that keep her satisfied and make the process enjoyable not a constant state of feeling punished.", "Stop making excuses and take some positive action.

This isn't about 'going on a diet and then losing weight and all is well with the world!', because she'll just put it all back on again when she ends the diet. She needs to learn how to eat healthy for her body type, and find a type of exercise that she likes. I hate walking and going to gyms, but I _love_ dancing, and if I had the space, it'd be my regular workout. \n\nAll you've done is teach her to reach for food when she needs comfort, and to dismiss a health professional's concern for her health.

I\u2019m sure that\u2019s very hard on a kid - so having it reinforced by her mother isn\u2019t helping. You did the dad thing and tried to take the pressure off. That was good. A weekend of bad food choices was not. This is going to need to be a gradual change. You don\u2019t deserve to hear from your ex that you aren\u2019t performing to her expectations when she makes excuses and does the same thing. Kids need both parents in this case to change their behaviors and habits. You spend the $ on food  and activities so make reasonable changes.

You and your wife both suck and are both failing your daughter in different ways. Your wife is being a bad parent because it sounds like she is shaming your daughter for her weight instead of trying to constructively help her, the shaming your wife is doing could easily lead to your daughter having some sort of an eating disorder. You on the other hand are also not constructively helping her, instead you\u2019re enabling her. Instead of just giving in to whatever she asks from you in terms of food you should be helping her find healthier alternatives that still taste good. For example with her asking for fried chicken for dinner why couldn\u2019t you have found some other tasty chicken dish to make her? That way it wouldn\u2019t be a salad but it also wouldn\u2019t be fried chicken. If you help her make healthy habits now she will be much better off in the long run. There\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with eating fried chicken, pancakes, and pizza but in the same weekend? That\u2019s definitely too much. Maybe find a nutritionist that you can go to with your daughter and offer to try some of the recipes you\u2019re given with her so that way she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s going through this journey alone and has a support system. Just do something other than enabling her unhealthy eating habits.", "What does your daughter think about the diet?  If she doesn't want to diet then...well, its her body, her choice.  If she does, then you really should be getting on board with it bc its far better for her health and since she's so young she's really dependent on you to provide her with the meals she ends up eating.  It would be exceedingly difficult for her to make progress if you're torpedoing her efforts.", "YTA 100% 220 is obese. I would strongly encourage you to take your daughter to get blood work done. If her glucose and A1C is higher than what it should be, that means she could have type 2 diabetes and NOTHING can reverse that. You feeding her junk is not helping her at all. If anything you\u2019re just killing your daughter faster. Type 2 diabetes damages her cells and it\u2019s irreversible. Yes you can take medication to help A1C and glucose but the cells will remain permanently damaged. She could also develop fatty liver/ organs which can make it harder for her body to function properly. Clogged arteries which could lead to heart attacks. The list goes on and on. \n\nIm all for cheat days on diets and understand why people have them but seriously? There\u2019s healthy food options for pancakes and pizza as well. It doesn\u2019t have to be gross food. You could make multi grain pancakes with fresh fruit and then pizza with plenty of veggies (or just a margarita pizza) and salad on the side. Even then she could have a fruit smoothie in the morning with avocado toast. For dinner she could have any meat with salt and pepper or other seasonings with vegetables. It doesn\u2019t have to be just salads. She needs exercise as well like cardio. \n\nYou really need to stop enabling your daughter. I think it\u2019s important to have this conversation with her and the mother present about her condition and what will occur if nothing is done about it. It\u2019s dangerous and she could potentially die very young if you allow her to continue with her current eating habits.", "Are you trying to kill your daughter?

And cook healthy meals !", "Your daughter is so good at manipulating you both it isn't even funny.", "it's literally a throwaway account, most people make them to post here, doesnt make them trolls at all. idk wtf a disneyland dad is either", "All of that sounds very tasty!", "I'm guessing this is hyperbole and correct me if I'm wrong on that. She didn't eat \" everything\"", "Because he's the \"super cool fun dad that never says no, never puts discipline and only sees her on occasions' so he's not an actual parent", "she tries not to dwell on it", "Tough comment, and I suspect you\u2019ll be downvoted, but you\u2019re right. Seriously OP, she\u2019ll hate you one day for this \u201cfun dad\u201d bs. Why don\u2019t you make a deal with her and get on a healthy eating plan with her? And instead of lounging you could go for a long stroll in a big park or whatever else is possible wherever you are this winter that isn\u2019t a boring exercise? I\u2019m guessing you need a little wake up call as well if fried chicken, pizza and pancakes are in your diet within 48 hrs.", "I like the fun activities idea", "It was.  Probably a bit too much salt but overall tasty and healthy.  \n\nThe biggest problems in the US (I am American and spent most of my life there) are portion size and the amount of bad things people drink.\n\nI don\u2019t even disagree with you about soul food.  I do that too sometimes. I\u2019m just saying the father here needs to get her eating some fruits and vegetables also as at least a side dish.  Get her in the habit of eating some healthy food even when she\u2019s eating to feed her soul.", "If your daughter wanted alcohol or drugs to comfort herself instead of junk food would you still buy it for her?\n\nChild obesity is generally the parents fault. Just like if your animal is obese, you're the one setting standards and feeding them since birth. Thyroid issues are rare compared to the amount of bad parenting going on. \n\nAre you or your wife obese?", "Exaggerated in your daughter's case?  Perhaps yes as it has not been indicated how much she ate.\n\nBut fried chicken, pizza then pancakes? All high caloric foods that I'm sure she didn't just have 1 or 2 pieces of each. And I highly doubt she had the pancakes without butter, whipped cream or syrup.", "she thinks she\u2019s going to \u201ceat salads\u201d when she goes back to mum, so here she eats \u201ceverything she can\u201d that she really wants. What you did is a hop skip and a jump along the road to creating a binge eating disorder because she feels she\u2019s not going to get the good stuff with mum, so she does too much at your house.\n\nFind a balance!!", "Which one day, she will resent. But hindsight is 20/20, OP. Right?", "Reading all your responses and they are so deliberately obtuse that I can only hope you are a troll because if not, my heart hurts for any child that exists in these circumstances with parents like you and like your ex. But especially you because at least your ex wants to try. You on the other hand don\u2019t seem to care about your child only about being the liked parent.", "How's that going? Grow up dad!", ">I\u2019m guessing you need a little wake up call as well if fried chicken, pizza and pancakes are in your diet within 48 hrs.\n\nThis! It's obscene. I would say that eating all this in a week is excessive but at least it's better than in a 48 hour period. OP even said in a comment that during the entire weekend, they ate no fruit or vegetables so I'm assuming that they ate other junk food which was just slightly less junky than this. Americans are crazy where food is concerned.", "Dealing with a weight issue with a teenage girl is a mine field, but that doesn\u2019t mean you bury your head in the sand. Do some research, find ways as a dad that you can help on the weekends you have her and make it a positive experience. I\u2019m sure you view her weekends as a \u201cbreak\u201d from a stricter mom, but that\u2019s not going to help your daughter. Seriously, work *with* your ex and your daughter will be so much better off.", "Try laser tag or paintball. They can be a good way to get some exercise, and still be fun.", "Just wanted to say, the best soul food is the 2 pack of packaged pancakes from familymart with a spicy famichicki stuffed in between. \n\nGood lord thats good after a night out at the Izakaya.", "no. I wouldn't buy her drugs or booze. And no, neither my ex or I are obese", "the pancakes had butter and a little syrup and you'd be right, she had more than 1-2 pieces of everything. Not sure how much chicken she ate, but we split the pizza 4 pieces each, and she had 4 pancakes", "Yes, the troll vibes are strong with this one", "A couple days ago I had lentil soup for lunch and two slices of pizza for dinner, no veggies. I was up all night with indigestion, really regretting my (not normal) actions. I can\u2019t imagine how this poor 17yo feels all the time.", "I agree and this sounds very reasonable. Breaks away from Mom and with Dad will help OP\u2019s daughter though especially if there\u2019s a good plan in place for helping everyone eat and live healthier more active lives and reorient to better habits and choices.\n\nIt does sound like OP\u2019s ex is so controlling though that she\u2019s happy to tell OP and the daughter what to do and then herself do whatever whenever she\u2019s \u201ctoo busy\u201d etc. So working with the ex might be tough. \n\nWorking with a plan the doctor recommends in consultation with OP\u2019s daughter sounds like it might be a better route and provide OP\u2019s daughter with more voice/agency and less domination/subordination that might be more likely to depress her or reject the Mom dictated plan.\n\nHaving a third party who is a professional who can help the daughter develop a health, nutrition, and activity plan that then the nutritionist and adolescent medicine specialty practice can help OP\u2019s daughter present to OP and his ex can possibly help the daughter feel more agency, confidence, control, and hope about it and less like it\u2019s just one more micromanagy thing her mom is going to try to force upon her to control and judge/shame her or as a punishment for \u201cbeing fat.\u201d\n\nThe daughter is 17 years old \u2014 likely old enough to work /consult directly with an adolescent medical practice doctor, therapist/social worker and nutritionist that will work best and be a good healthy fit for OP\u2019s daughter.\n\nThen OP\u2019s daughter and the specialty team can present the plan to OP and his ex-wife and they can ask for everyone\u2019s commitment to help support OP\u2019s daughter to work towards her goals and they can try to adapt and model those healthier more active choices and balanced meals and hydration as well. \n\nGood luck to you and your daughter, OP!", "Even just a nice walk somewhere is better than a day sat in front of the tv"]}
