In my side of the family, this is the sixth grandkid, while in his it's the first (he's an only child, while I'm the third \u201csurprise\u201d kid).  \nHis side is ecstatic even if it's a little early, my side is not that happy. Especially my sister (38f) who is a divorcee and she thinks I fucked it up, but she supports me no matter what.  \nAbout the problem: my future in-laws paid for a special ultrasound appointment as a birthday present for me. I was happy at first because this thing was not cheap, and I wanted to see my baby in this.  The problem is that only three people can come, and that would be my fiancee and his parents, no one from my side. The second problem was that I had to wear a hospital gown, so basically, I would lay there in my panties and a pulled-up gown in front of my father-in-law and I'm way too shy to do that. Even the thought of it gives me the ick.  \nSo I asked my fiancee to switch his dad with my sister, but he said that his parents paid for it so they had to be there, and my FIL would only look at the screen, not my panties.  \nSo I decided not to go to the ultrasound and called my future in-laws to cancel it. Unfortunately, there is a cancellation fee (50%)  that I offered to pay back.  \nMy in-laws are not angry at me, just a little disappointed, but my fiancee is furious. \nSo AITA? \n\nAdding info, plus mini update: about the bikini question: no I wouldn't wear a bikini. At all. I have a one piece, and I put swimming shorts in top of it.  But rarely go swimming too, because fale skin+skincancer runs in my family. (Yes, I'm white as a ghost, but no, I don't have vitamin D deficiency.)\nMy sister called, and laughed at this dilemma (I blurred out). We where in the same clinic, when I was 8 and my oldest niece was 6. She wore a white dress (because there was a heatwave, and I thought that was a hospital gown (it looked the same). So she kinda laughed at me for a solid ten minutes, for reading my anxiety with false memories.  \nNothing HIPPA violation in place, this isn't a medical testing, this has fully entertainment purposes, they only had to share my name and how far along I am.\nMy in-laws got actually mortified with the pulling down the pants part. FIL never was in an US appointment, and MIL doesn't even remembered (her last was a quarter of a century ago).  \nNow about my fiancee. He took the ruling well, and apologized.  He just got overly excited (he's craving for his parents attention and acceptance a lil too much.\nSo yeah. My sister will come to the ultrasound.", "created_utc": 1693406744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165gpxf/aita_for_canceling_a_prepaid_ultrasound/", "score": 2313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was it a birthday present for you or for them???", "NTA\n\nWhy the ***hell*** does father in law want to be present? And why does your fiance want it even more than the FIL? In fact, why does anyone but your fiance want to be there? This seems really weird to me.\n\nBut I mean...you do want an ultrasound at some point, no? Confirm everything is going along ok, etc.", "NTA. This \"gift\" obviously came with strings attached. Did you explain to your fiance's family why you were uncomfortable? They may have been willing to accomodate you. Honestly, your fiance is the problem here. You and baby need to be his priority over his parents.", "NTA. Paying for the ultrasound is nice, insisting they attend is super weird.", "Info: did you talk to his mom (since they\u2019re paying) about your concerns and wanting to switch people? They may have been okay with doing that. Did you explain why you wanted it cancelled? Or just that you did?\n\nNTA. Your comfort and safety are the most important at your appointments. No one should be there if you don\u2019t want them there. It doesn\u2019t matter who that person is.", "NTA.  It is irrelevant who has how many grandkids. The only person responsible for your medical care is you. Your in-laws overstepped boundaries in a major way by just scheduling the appointment. Then they further invaded what should be a special bonding time between you and SO by inviting themselves along to your appointment.  Time to sit with SO and establish boundaries, then time to communicate those boundaries to in-laws. Do this now or the next major fight will be who is where during delivery.", "NTA. \n\nMedical appointments are not spectator sports (even if this isn't strictly for medical purposes, it's in that same vein). The only people that should be in the room with you are the people you are comfortable with. There's no negotiation on that front, no justification needed on  your part.\n\nPresumably you would get a video and still images from this?  If so, you could share that with the inlaws.\n\nIf the only reason they offered this to you is so they can be there, it wasn't a gift for you in any way, it was a gift for themselves. That's not an acceptable condition for a gift.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is being an ass, he ought to be backing you up on this.", "NTA!!!!\n\nIn fact your fiance sounds like a massive asshole right now. But I will give him the benefit of the doubt that he can learn a bit from this.\n\nIn every situation, you ALWAYS have full control over who gets access to your body, your medical information and your privacy. Paying for an appointment does not give someone the right to see you lying on the actual exam table. That would imply his parents paid for a private viewing of \"their\" property inside of your body. That's not a gift. That's disgusting!\n\nHonestly, I'm fine with them asking if you were okay with them coming in because they are excited - but the moment you asked for you sister to be there instead, them not backing off reads super weird and intrusive to me.   \nThat is why they give you pictures/videos after the ultra sound.\n\nYour body, your choice. You are not their grandkids' birthing machine!", "NTA. There are places you can get a pregnancy ultrasound where you don't have to be in a hospital gown. Surprising someone with the requirement that they be basically nude in your presence is not cool. \n\nYour fiance needs to get over it. If his parents pay for a private room for the birth, is he going to insist that they be allowed in the room while you're pushing?", "NTA. I mean to give a gift like that it needs to be established that the recipient of the gift would be comfortable with said gift.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s a private moment and not wanting your FIL to see you in your underwear is completely understandable.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to realise that when it comes to your pregnancy you are in charge, it\u2019s your body and your autonomy doesn\u2019t disappear. You decide who attends appointments and you decide who attends the birth.", "NTA your body your choice who sees it \u2014 and it\u2019s contents.", "NTA. It was a generous and thoughtful gift BUT that doesn't obligate you to be comfortable participating when you feel exposed and vulnerable in essentially a medical setting, and you have the added pressure of balancing the happiness of each side of the family. \n\nWho exactly was insisting that his parents be present? Was it their expectation, as part of the gift, that they'd get to be present? Or did your fiancee introduce that idea as a way to 'thank' them for the gift? \n\nFrankly your fiancee is being TA here, he should be more supportive and considerate of your position. You simply should NOT feel pressured to do something like this if you just aren't comfortable, and receiving a generous gift shouldn't obligate you to.", "NTA. You are the only one that needs to be comfortable, and you aren't there to make anyone comfortable. You are in control of you, and not wanting to be seen in such a compromising position is completely fine. Let your fianc\u00e9e be mad. You haven't done anything wrong.", "So gross NTA.\n\n\nAre they going to expect to watch the birth, too? \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA\n\nThis was either a gift or it was something they bought for themselves that requires your participation without any input. \n\nHave you said to your in-laws, \u201clook I am not comfortable with my medical exams being a spectator sport. This is still my body & I get to say who gets to see the outside & inside of me. Now if this was really a gift to me, I would like to extend an invite to MIL to join my sister & fianc\u00e9 in the exam. We will share copies of the scan afterwards. If this was not a gift but something you wanted for yourselves, since it requires my body you should have checked with me first & been clear about the conditions\u201d. \n\nYou need to be paying attention to everyone\u2019s behavior right now. Does your fianc\u00e9 support you and does what he needs to to make you feel safe? Do your in-laws feel money allows them control over your life & your child? How they behave now & how they respond to you wanting bodily autonomy will tell you what your future will look like.", "NTA. \n\nThis isn't a present for you. This is a gift to themselves. \n\nAn ultrasound is, however, first and foremost, a medical procedure. Medical procedures don't generally double as entertainment. The comfort and consent of the patient come first, last, and everywhere in between. The same applies to birth, too.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do something that makes you uncomfortable", "NTA I think   \n\n\nYou have the right to feel uncomfortable but I feel like a conversation could of happened with your fiance that shouldn't of been so dismissive. I feel like your fiance should of heard you out better and that worries me for your future but hopefully it's not a regular thing  \n\n\nAlso if it's a 3D place they can stream the scan online, I did that for my family as they are in a different province from me.", "Just me but I would of suggested it just be you and your partner. Its your baby it should be a moment for both of you. \n\nNTA\n\nMaybe it was a waste of money but if you aren't comfortable with the in laws there they shouldn't be there.", "NTA you offered a valid compromise.  It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d be uncomfortable with FIL there under those circumstances.  It\u2019s not like you were trying to exclude both of them.", "NTA- you don't owe them anything.", "NTA-  Its a gift. It shouldn't come with entitlement. Your comfort is paramount in a situation like that. Lol your fianc\u00e9e is treating it like they bought you an amusement park ticket and they just wanted to come spend the day with you.  \n\nIts so weird that your fianc\u00e9e is mad at you. Most of the time its just the dad and the mom of the baby at the ultrasound and every else gets pictures. I'd try to figure out the underlying reasons for his anger cause its super not justified.", "Pretty sure this is a 3d ultrasound, just FYI, you can record and stream it. No one needs to be present in the room with you if you aren't comfortable.\n\nNTA, but there were better alternatives here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine not to allow anyone but your partner with you at ANY medical exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur partner is the AH.", "Nta and I think your sister is right, you fucked up. Only if your fiancee is really not on your side anyway. You picked a bad guy", "So this was a birthday present with strings attached?! \nA birthday present is meant to be yours to do whatever you wanna do with it. Its not a birhtday present when they impose themselfs! They are assholes for that! \n\nYour husband is also an asshole for not standying up for you! \n\nJust because you are pregnant with their grandson/your husband babies that doesnt mean you start loosing feelings and rights. You are still a human and you have every right to decide who you want with you in this kind of moments.\n\nNTA!", "NTA. \n\nHave you called the company and asked what is expected as far as dress during the scan? \n\nMany places just have you wear comfortable clothes (think elastic waistband pants/shorts and a tshirt and only the abdomen is exposed. \n\nI have 5 kids and I don't think I have ever gotten a glimpse of my underwear during an ultrasound. \n\nAt the end of the day, your comfort is what matters most.", "NTA  - When the gift was presented, did his parents make it clear that they expected to attend the appointment with you?  Did you discuss your objections at all with them, or was your fiance the go-between? \n\nDid you explain why you cancelled to your inlaws, or did you leave that to your fiance? \n\nYour fiance can be furious all he likes, you don't have to let anyone see you in  your underwear that  you don't want to see you in your underwear.", "NTA.  An ultrasound, even the fun 3D ones, is a medical procedure where you are in a vulnerable position and there's no promise that everything will go as planned.  You felt uncomfortable with your FIL there, which is super normal.  Hell, I wouldn't have wanted my MIL there either.  Your fianc\u00e9's reaction is a big red flag, as your request was to be expected and there's nothing for him to be mad about.  Be careful with him, and good luck.", "You do what\u2019s good for you.", "NTA but I don't think canceling it was the way to go about it. It's also odd to assume your father in law would look at you inappropriately. It's just an ultrasound, not a gyno exam, but I get your hesitation. \n\nAlso re: your fianc\u00e9 saying your dad was entitled to be there - no. They paid for it so you can see your baby, any other motive is unhealthy and selfish. An ultrasound is to make sure everything is okay. Your in laws need to chill tf out and you better set this boundary with your fianc\u00e9 if you want things to work out. \n\nYou're entitled to make sure you feel comfortable during the exam so if you believe you weren't going to feel comfortable then it's your right to do it or not. Regardless though you should seek out an ultrasound. I hope everything goes okay. I'm a bit worried about situation but I wish you the best.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This was something your future in-laws wanted, and felt it would go over better if they didn't ask you to do it, but instead \"gave\" it as a present.\n\nThis is a perfect time for your fiance to learn that while you and he are a team when it comes to decisions about your child, until that child is born, YOU are the decision-maker. He doesn't get to choose who gets to look at your partially clothed or unclothed body, who learns private health-related information, or who attends medical appointments - you choose.\n\nHaving a child is a series of medical procedures - it's not family entertainment.", "NTA, but if this is how your fianc\u00e9 reacted I can understand why your sister is concerned. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve decided to have a child with a controlling AH who doesn\u2019t respect your bodily autonomy.

Your legs have nothing to do with an ultrasound. You for sure can wear pants and lift up your shirt or wear the gown as a shirt and shorts on pants as bottoms. At 18 weeks the baby is up very high and they won\u2019t need to go that low towards your pubic bone. \n\nOn a side note a lot of the older generation didn\u2019t get to see ultrasounds and think they\u2019re fascinating. My nana had never seen one and loved it. It makes it more real for some ppl. I say NAH", "NTA.

Red flag alert.  You have a fiance problem.  For him to be mad at you because you didn't want your FFIL to be there during a MEDICAL exam (and yes that is what this is) makes him a total AH. I would NOT be comfortable in that situation with my FIL either!", "Oddly, I kept thinking about this problem. And I wanted to add something.\n\nSo... with a son being his parents' only child, you are their only chance to somewhat experience what it may be like to have a daughter. That doesn't excuse the situation -- especially not your fiance, because from your replies I got a sense that he was the pushy one and if he had just stood by you and told your parents, your MIL and your sister are coming along everything would have been fine and you could have gone to the appointment. \n\nBut for you, it may be helpful for the future to think about this. You very much get to have boundaries and good on you for cancelling and setting them. But as long as they show care and love for you and not just their grandchild, maybe let them in a bit and allow them to treat you like the daughter they didn't get to have? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the fianc\u00e9:\n\nDude, shape up. Your future wife and child are your first allegiance now, and their comfort must come first or you will have a very unhappy marriage. Be on her side! Especially with something so infinitely reasonable. You have to be the glue here, you have to mediate conflicts better instead of making it so much worse by getting angry.\n\nAnd maybe most importantly: It's really not okay to argue that \"my FIL would only look at the screen, not my panties.\" That is reversing something pretty fundamental. Your future wife has a right to feel shy about her body and you are making it sound like she is the messed up one for suggesting your FIL would see her panties. NO! It's not about where exactly he looks. It's about his presence when she is in a vulnerable position. If you don't get that - ask yourself how you would feel about her going to shower at a gym and a few guys to step into that group shower... saying \"why are you bothered, we're not looking at your bits\". I know its an extreme example, but the idea is: don't put it on the person who desires physical autonomy and privacy to explain why she needs it. It's her right. No questions ask.

You can show them the pictures of the ultrasound (I hear some of them do videos as well) but I would not have anyone other than my partner in the appointment with me, no matter who paid for it.", "Just because you are still technically covered doesn't mean she won't feel exposed, ultrasounds can be very sensitive moments and can make someone feel so valuable and exposed", "I know someone that did the extra, fun ones. I'm not sure how it is anywhere else, but the woman doing her scan had quit her job as an ultrasound tech at an OB's office to work at the 3d place. I wouldn't think they'd just hire anyone off the street for that.", "My first ultrasound was vaginal, for that one I had to use the bathrob. \n\nI was ignorant about it, but yeah was not what I was expected. The latter ones were  the regular ones and I just wear my regular clothes.", "Yep.  The reason I wore pants to all my appts.  Getting the jelly off was crummy enough.  Getting checked down the line also sucks enough.  I don\u2019t want to be yanking up a dress for everything.  The later ultrasounds (not that fun early wand thing one) were a piece of cake where you showed nothing.", "Well that doesn't sound like a fun combination.", "Oof.  I had gallstones during mine.  Kidney stones sound way worse and gallstones make you incredibly itchy to the point of madness because of bile acids coming through the skin.  Tell your fianc\u00e9e I\u2019m so incredibly sorry.", "Yeah. I was referring to her 18 week ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasounds are done in early pregnancy like you had. This lady is no longer in early pregnancy.", "Of course it should be her choice but she\u2019s basing her choice on likely false information. She\u2019s uncomfortable because she doesn\u2019t want to be in panties in from of her FIL. But in reality, she would likely be fully clothed and just have her shirt pulled up. If she had this correct info, her choice may have been different.", "Yeah, my bad.", "NTA. Everyone else is. You should have every right to decide who is in that room with you. They cover you up well, but it can be an extremely private, emotional, and bonding moment to see your child on ultrasound for the first time. It really should be between you and your fianc\u00e9. I\u2019d call it generosity to give you that gift, but it wasn\u2019t. It was self-serving and your fianc\u00e9 should\u2019ve realized his parents didn\u2019t belong in that experience with you two. It is a red flag.", "NTA because you always have right to who sees your body. But generally for the type of ultrasound you are referring to they just lift your shirt, or at least your bottom half would be fully covered. Did you verify with the office that you would be exposed in the way you are thinking?", "I\u2019ve taken ultra sounds before and you don\u2019t have to take your pants all the way off or take your shirt all the way off. \n\nYNTA but you\u2019re being a bit overdramatic. I hate saying that (overdramatic) cause who am I to judge your reaction?, nobody, so take that with a grain of salt.", "NTA. Eww, you are *never ever* required to allow your in-laws to be present for medical exam. Gross!", "NTA it should be you and your fiance. The givers do not get to dictate who you invite", "NTA they seem very controlling. Proud of you for cancelling", "NTA, and if it's one of those 3d ultrasounds it is completely unnecessary. You are absolutely correct in canceling for your comfort. You should not gave to lay there exposed and uncomfortable just so they can see an image that they will see in the flesh in a few more months", "Just make it yourself and your fiance only.  If they gave it as a gift, well, gifts don't come with strings.", "You don\u2019t have an obgyn to track progress of the baby? I didn\u2019t know people had to have others pay for special ultrasounds. It was normally for us to frequently visit the obgyn during my wife\u2019s pregnancy for checkups\n\nEdit: forgot to add YTA since it seems like you don\u2019t know what an ultrasound is", "My niece had this, and they had several family members in the room.", "Yeah I don\u2019t get why OP thought she had to be stripped basically? Maybe they think it\u2019s a vaginal ultrasound for some reason?", "They attempted to make a decision for OP about what she would do with her own body. \n\nThat is creepy.\n\nBesides, why could they not have chosen to pay for a video of the ultrasound, too?  Then they could see the baby and OP is not creeped out.", "Yea. Fuck that 100%. This whole thing is gross on a very basic level, even before in laws insisting on seeing her in her underwear", "There's nothing technical about it. You're either covered, or you're not. She could even cover her stomach, if she was so fussed. Everyone - including the technician - is looking at the screen, not her protruding abdomen.", "You\u2019re not TA, but you\u2019re also overreacting about the ultrasound. \n\nIf ultrasounds in your country (the US?) are anything like they are in Canada, Australia,or Japan, nobody in the room will see anything down there except maybe the technician. \n\nI didn\u2019t see my wife\u2019s anything during the ultrasound for both my kids. All eyes were glued to the screen, and I was sitting beside her (near her head).", "How ridiculous.  What kind of man would let his woman be in such a vulnerable situation ?\n\nYou\u2019re going to have massive problems.\n\nNTA", "Understandable", "As someone who was once \u201ctoo shy\u201d and then had two children, this made me laugh.\n\nOP, remember this point in time when you were \u201ctoo shy\u201d to have an ultrasound, because when you\u2019re having the baby, if delivering vaginally\u2026a whole team of doctors and nurses are going to be gazing into your private parts. You\u2019re going to be sitting in a hospital gown with no underpants for a really long time.  If you have an epidural, you\u2019re getting a catheter and a nurse is going to be manually extracting your urine because you\u2019ll be numb and unable to pee normally.  It\u2019s common for women to poop while they\u2019re pushing the baby out.  And at the end of it, you\u2019ll be so sore and so many people will have been down there, that you won\u2019t even have the energy to care who is looking at what.", "It\u2019s not a transvaginal probe at 18 weeks. You can wear pants or shorts. You just have to be able to slide the waist band down a touch.", "NTA and I\u2019m probably projecting because my MIL wanted to do this stuff, and wouldn\u2019t stop pestering me, so I did invite her to an ultrasound and she made it very uncomfortable and weird. Good on you for saying no.", "This is just weird. Pregnancy as a spectator sport? \n\nOf course, you're NTA. Your father-in-law can wait to see the baby after you've given birth. You know, like normal people do. He absolutely isn't entitled to see you in such a vulnerable situation if you feel uncomfortable. \n\n(Your reference to HIPPA suggests that you're in the US, the country with the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the developed world, and people want to throw money around for \"entertainment\" ultrasounds. What an insane world.)", "NTA.  It's a little odd to have your in-laws there.  Worst case scenario -- couldn't you wear shorts and bring a blanket to cover up below the waist and your legs/feet?", "Why would a future grandparent not want to see their future grandchild? Is that what you are actually asking?? May sound crazy, but some families actually like each other \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think you are the one, who don't know, what 3D or 4D ultrasounds are. They can be gifts, because they are not medical checkup.", "I can totally understand feeling exposed in front of her FIL. What I don\u2019t get is thinking her family should be included. They didn\u2019t paid for it. Plus she herself said her family isn\u2019t happy about the pregnancy and said her sister thinks she \u201cfucked up\u201d why would you want anyone who feels that way to be in the room? Especially when the in laws paid for it and were excited about the experience and for their first grandchild", "Agree that the 3D ultrasounds are a little creepy.  Those images always come out looking so weird.\n\nAlso agree that bringing family isn\u2019t weird - people are excited to see that little developing bean!  I invited a different family member to come to each of my ultrasounds for my firstborn (couldn\u2019t for 2nd because of the panini).  Everyone was so excited to see her moving around and hear her heartbeat. We weren\u2019t allowed to take videos or pictures, and the printouts just are not the same as being there. Family got to see her, hear her heartbeat, and take an ultrasound picture home.  I thought it was pretty special!", "It\u2019s not an anatomy scan. It\u2019s a private business elective ultrasound. Usually for 3D photos with extended family present. It\u2019s just for fun. There is not a radiologist reading the images. It does not take the place of the anatomy scan. They take pictures, heart rate, confirm sex and position of baby and placenta (not always accurate.)\n\nMost places require that you have already undergone all recommended diagnostics at your OB.", "NTA. This is a huge red flag and I\u2019d be reconsidering the pregnancy and ending the relationship", "NTA but op, this is a great time to set expectations for birth or your dumbass, I mean DH will have his parents all up your vagina with gloves on. You get to keep things private and comfortable, it\u2019s your body, and no amount of money should change that.", "They keep you  covered pretty well. The others are to the back and won't see much of you.  But they should honor the fact you are modest and prefer tje FIL not in room.\nPS..an ultrasound is a medical device and is not a plaything for grandparents.", "Because people are weird and have no boundaries.  My FIL called my husband saying he\u2019s on the way when I was getting my c section.  Husband told him it\u2019s not a good idea, he was like it\u2019ll be fine.  I was in the OR and he got all the way to the anastethic bay before a nurse kicked him out.  To this day he doesn\u2019t understand why that wasn\u2019t appropriate", "Wait til the baby is born\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but they may be a nightmare for her\u2026 she is clearly NTA", ">or put on a hospital gown with a medical towel draped over her lower half\n\nThis still isn't the same as being clothed (in your own clothes) in my book.", "Ok, perfect sample then. Which was worse? The kidney stones or labor? I\u2019ve always heard that they\u2019re close, I\u2019ve had stones and thank god labor is impossible for me."]}
