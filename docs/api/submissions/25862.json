In my side of the family, this is the sixth grandkid, while in his it's the first (he's an only child, while I'm the third \u201csurprise\u201d kid).  \nHis side is ecstatic even if it's a little early, my side is not that happy. Especially my sister (38f) who is a divorcee and she thinks I fucked it up, but she supports me no matter what.  \nAbout the problem: my future in-laws paid for a special ultrasound appointment as a birthday present for me. I was happy at first because this thing was not cheap, and I wanted to see my baby in this.  The problem is that only three people can come, and that would be my fiancee and his parents, no one from my side. The second problem was that I had to wear a hospital gown, so basically, I would lay there in my panties and a pulled-up gown in front of my father-in-law and I'm way too shy to do that. Even the thought of it gives me the ick.  \nSo I asked my fiancee to switch his dad with my sister, but he said that his parents paid for it so they had to be there, and my FIL would only look at the screen, not my panties.  \nSo I decided not to go to the ultrasound and called my future in-laws to cancel it. Unfortunately, there is a cancellation fee (50%)  that I offered to pay back.  \nMy in-laws are not angry at me, just a little disappointed, but my fiancee is furious. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1693406744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165gpxf/aita_for_canceling_a_prepaid_ultrasound/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was it a birthday present for you or for them???", "NTA\n\nWhy the ***hell*** does father in law want to be present? And why does your fiance want it even more than the FIL? In fact, why does anyone but your fiance want to be there? This seems really weird to me.\n\nBut I mean...you do want an ultrasound at some point, no? Confirm everything is going along ok, etc.", "NTA. This \"gift\" obviously came with strings attached. Did you explain to your fiance's family why you were uncomfortable? They may have been willing to accomodate you. Honestly, your fiance is the problem here. You and baby need to be his priority over his parents.", "NTA. Paying for the ultrasound is nice, insisting they attend is super weird.", "Info: did you talk to his mom (since they\u2019re paying) about your concerns and wanting to switch people? They may have been okay with doing that. Did you explain why you wanted it cancelled? Or just that you did?\n\nNTA. Your comfort and safety are the most important at your appointments. No one should be there if you don\u2019t want them there. It doesn\u2019t matter who that person is.", "NTA.  It is irrelevant who has how many grandkids. The only person responsible for your medical care is you. Your in-laws overstepped boundaries in a major way by just scheduling the appointment. Then they further invaded what should be a special bonding time between you and SO by inviting themselves along to your appointment.  Time to sit with SO and establish boundaries, then time to communicate those boundaries to in-laws. Do this now or the next major fight will be who is where during delivery.", "NTA. \n\nMedical appointments are not spectator sports (even if this isn't strictly for medical purposes, it's in that same vein). The only people that should be in the room with you are the people you are comfortable with. There's no negotiation on that front, no justification needed on  your part.\n\nPresumably you would get a video and still images from this?  If so, you could share that with the inlaws.\n\nIf the only reason they offered this to you is so they can be there, it wasn't a gift for you in any way, it was a gift for themselves. That's not an acceptable condition for a gift.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is being an ass, he ought to be backing you up on this.", "NTA!!!! \n\nIn fact your fiance sounds like a massive asshole right now. But I will give him the benefit of the doubt that he can learn a bit from this.\n\nIn every situation, you ALWAYS have full control over who gets access to your body, your medical information and your privacy. Paying for an appointment does not give someone the right to see you lying on the actual exam table. That would imply his parents paid for a private viewing of \"their\" property inside of your body. That's not a gift. That's disgusting!\n\nHonestly, I'm fine with them asking if you were okay with them coming in because they are excited - but the moment you asked for you sister to be there instead, them not backing off reads super weird and intrusive to me. And that is why they give you pictures after the ultra sound. \n\nYour body, your choice. You are not their grandkids birthing machine!", "NTA. There are places you can get a pregnancy ultrasound where you don't have to be in a hospital gown. Surprising someone with the requirement that they be basically nude in your presence is not cool. \n\nYour fiance needs to get over it. If his parents pay for a private room for the birth, is he going to insist that they be allowed in the room while you're pushing?", "NTA. I mean to give a gift like that it needs to be established that the recipient of the gift would be comfortable with said gift.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s a private moment and not wanting your FIL to see you in your underwear is completely understandable.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to realise that when it comes to your pregnancy you are in charge, it\u2019s your body and your autonomy doesn\u2019t disappear. You decide who attends appointments and you decide who attends the birth.", "NTA your body your choice who sees it \u2014 and it\u2019s contents.", "NTA. It was a generous and thoughtful gift BUT that doesn't obligate you to be comfortable participating when you feel exposed and vulnerable in essentially a medical setting, and you have the added pressure of balancing the happiness of each side of the family. \n\nWho exactly was insisting that his parents be present? Was it their expectation, as part of the gift, that they'd get to be present? Or did your fiancee introduce that idea as a way to 'thank' them for the gift? \n\nFrankly your fiancee is being TA here, he should be more supportive and considerate of your position. You simply should NOT feel pressured to do something like this if you just aren't comfortable, and receiving a generous gift shouldn't obligate you to.", "NTA. You are the only one that needs to be comfortable, and you aren't there to make anyone comfortable. You are in control of you, and not wanting to be seen in such a compromising position is completely fine. Let your fianc\u00e9e be mad. You haven't done anything wrong.", "So gross NTA.\n\n\nAre they going to expect to watch the birth, too? \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA\n\nThis was either a gift or it was something they bought for themselves that requires your participation without any input. \n\nHave you said to your in-laws, \u201clook I am not comfortable with my medical exams being a spectator sport. This is still my body & I get to say who gets to see the outside & inside of me. Now if this was really a gift to me, I would like to extend an invite to MIL to join my sister & fianc\u00e9 in the exam. We will share copies of the scan afterwards. If this was not a gift but something you wanted for yourselves, since it requires my body you should have checked with me first & been clear about the conditions\u201d. \n\nYou need to be paying attention to everyone\u2019s behavior right now. Does your fianc\u00e9 support you and does what he needs to to make you feel safe? Do your in-laws feel money allows them control over your life & your child? How they behave now & how they respond to you wanting bodily autonomy will tell you what your future will look like.", "NTA. \n\nThis isn't a present for you. This is a gift to themselves. \n\nAn ultrasound is, however, first and foremost, a medical procedure. Medical procedures don't generally double as entertainment. The comfort and consent of the patient come first, last, and everywhere in between. The same applies to birth, too.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do something that makes you uncomfortable", "NTA I think   \n\n\nYou have the right to feel uncomfortable but I feel like a conversation could of happened with your fiance that shouldn't of been so dismissive. I feel like your fiance should of heard you out better and that worries me for your future but hopefully it's not a regular thing  \n\n\nAlso if it's a 3D place they can stream the scan online, I did that for my family as they are in a different province from me.", "Just me but I would of suggested it just be you and your partner. Its your baby it should be a moment for both of you. \n\nNTA\n\nMaybe it was a waste of money but if you aren't comfortable with the in laws there they shouldn't be there.", "NTA you offered a valid compromise.  It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d be uncomfortable with FIL there under those circumstances.  It\u2019s not like you were trying to exclude both of them.", "NTA- you don't owe them anything.", "NTA-  Its a gift. It shouldn't come with entitlement. Your comfort is paramount in a situation like that. Lol your fianc\u00e9e is treating it like they bought you an amusement park ticket and they just wanted to come spend the day with you.  \n\nIts so weird that your fianc\u00e9e is mad at you. Most of the time its just the dad and the mom of the baby at the ultrasound and every else gets pictures. I'd try to figure out the underlying reasons for his anger cause its super not justified.", "Pretty sure this is a 3d ultrasound, just FYI, you can record and stream it. No one needs to be present in the room with you if you aren't comfortable.\n\nNTA, but there were better alternatives here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine not to allow anyone but your partner with you at ANY medical exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur partner is the AH.", "Nta and I think your sister is right, you fucked up. Only if your fiancee is really not on your side anyway. You picked a bad guy", "So this was a birthday present with strings attached?! \nA birthday present is meant to be yours to do whatever you wanna do with it. Its not a birhtday present when they impose themselfs! They are assholes for that! \n\nYour husband is also an asshole for not standying up for you! \n\nJust because you are pregnant with their grandson/your husband babies that doesnt mean you start loosing feelings and rights. You are still a human and you have every right to decide who you want with you in this kind of moments.\n\nNTA!", "NTA. \n\nHave you called the company and asked what is expected as far as dress during the scan? \n\nMany places just have you wear comfortable clothes (think elastic waistband pants/shorts and a tshirt and only the abdomen is exposed. \n\nI have 5 kids and I don't think I have ever gotten a glimpse of my underwear during an ultrasound. \n\nAt the end of the day, your comfort is what matters most.", "NTA  - When the gift was presented, did his parents make it clear that they expected to attend the appointment with you?  Did you discuss your objections at all with them, or was your fiance the go-between? \n\nDid you explain why you cancelled to your inlaws, or did you leave that to your fiance? \n\nYour fiance can be furious all he likes, you don't have to let anyone see you in  your underwear that  you don't want to see you in your underwear.", "NTA.  An ultrasound, even the fun 3D ones, is a medical procedure where you are in a vulnerable position and there's no promise that everything will go as planned.  You felt uncomfortable with your FIL there, which is super normal.  Hell, I wouldn't have wanted my MIL there either.  Your fianc\u00e9's reaction is a big red flag, as your request was to be expected and there's nothing for him to be mad about.  Be careful with him, and good luck.", "You do what\u2019s good for you.", "NTA but I don't think canceling it was the way to go about it. It's also odd to assume your father in law would look at you inappropriately. It's just an ultrasound, not a gyno exam, but I get your hesitation. \n\nAlso re: your fianc\u00e9 saying your dad was entitled to be there - no. They paid for it so you can see your baby, any other motive is unhealthy and selfish. An ultrasound is to make sure everything is okay. Your in laws need to chill tf out and you better set this boundary with your fianc\u00e9 if you want things to work out. \n\nYou're entitled to make sure you feel comfortable during the exam so if you believe you weren't going to feel comfortable then it's your right to do it or not. Regardless though you should seek out an ultrasound. I hope everything goes okay. I'm a bit worried about situation but I wish you the best.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
