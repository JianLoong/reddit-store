In my side of the family, this is the sixth grandkid, while in his it's the first (he's an only child, while I'm the third \u201csurprise\u201d kid).  \nHis side is ecstatic even if it's a little early, my side is not that happy. Especially my sister (38f) who is a divorcee and she thinks I fucked it up, but she supports me no matter what.  \nAbout the problem: my future in-laws paid for a special ultrasound appointment as a birthday present for me. I was happy at first because this thing was not cheap, and I wanted to see my baby in this.  The problem is that only three people can come, and that would be my fiancee and his parents, no one from my side. The second problem was that I had to wear a hospital gown, so basically, I would lay there in my panties and a pulled-up gown in front of my father-in-law and I'm way too shy to do that. Even the thought of it gives me the ick.  \nSo I asked my fiancee to switch his dad with my sister, but he said that his parents paid for it so they had to be there, and my FIL would only look at the screen, not my panties.  \nSo I decided not to go to the ultrasound and called my future in-laws to cancel it. Unfortunately, there is a cancellation fee (50%)  that I offered to pay back.  \nMy in-laws are not angry at me, just a little disappointed, but my fiancee is furious. \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1693406744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165gpxf/aita_for_canceling_a_prepaid_ultrasound/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was it a birthday present for you or for them???", "NTA\n\nWhy the ***hell*** does father in law want to be present? And why does your fiance want it even more than the FIL? In fact, why does anyone but your fiance want to be there? This seems really weird to me.\n\nBut I mean...you do want an ultrasound at some point, no? Confirm everything is going along ok, etc.", "NTA. This \"gift\" obviously came with strings attached. Did you explain to your fiance's family why you were uncomfortable? They may have been willing to accomodate you. Honestly, your fiance is the problem here. You and baby need to be his priority over his parents.", "NTA. Paying for the ultrasound is nice, insisting they attend is super weird.", "Info: did you talk to his mom (since they\u2019re paying) about your concerns and wanting to switch people? They may have been okay with doing that. Did you explain why you wanted it cancelled? Or just that you did?\n\nNTA. Your comfort and safety are the most important at your appointments. No one should be there if you don\u2019t want them there. It doesn\u2019t matter who that person is.", "NTA.  It is irrelevant who has how many grandkids. The only person responsible for your medical care is you. Your in-laws overstepped boundaries in a major way by just scheduling the appointment. Then they further invaded what should be a special bonding time between you and SO by inviting themselves along to your appointment.  Time to sit with SO and establish boundaries, then time to communicate those boundaries to in-laws. Do this now or the next major fight will be who is where during delivery.", "NTA. \n\nMedical appointments are not spectator sports (even if this isn't strictly for medical purposes, it's in that same vein). The only people that should be in the room with you are the people you are comfortable with. There's no negotiation on that front, no justification needed on  your part.\n\nPresumably you would get a video and still images from this?  If so, you could share that with the inlaws.\n\nIf the only reason they offered this to you is so they can be there, it wasn't a gift for you in any way, it was a gift for themselves. That's not an acceptable condition for a gift.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is being an ass, he ought to be backing you up on this.", "NTA!!!!\n\nIn fact your fiance sounds like a massive asshole right now. But I will give him the benefit of the doubt that he can learn a bit from this.\n\nIn every situation, you ALWAYS have full control over who gets access to your body, your medical information and your privacy. Paying for an appointment does not give someone the right to see you lying on the actual exam table. That would imply his parents paid for a private viewing of \"their\" property inside of your body. That's not a gift. That's disgusting!\n\nHonestly, I'm fine with them asking if you were okay with them coming in because they are excited - but the moment you asked for you sister to be there instead, them not backing off reads super weird and intrusive to me.   \nThat is why they give you pictures/videos after the ultra sound.\n\nYour body, your choice. You are not their grandkids' birthing machine!", "NTA. There are places you can get a pregnancy ultrasound where you don't have to be in a hospital gown. Surprising someone with the requirement that they be basically nude in your presence is not cool. \n\nYour fiance needs to get over it. If his parents pay for a private room for the birth, is he going to insist that they be allowed in the room while you're pushing?", "NTA. I mean to give a gift like that it needs to be established that the recipient of the gift would be comfortable with said gift.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s a private moment and not wanting your FIL to see you in your underwear is completely understandable.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to realise that when it comes to your pregnancy you are in charge, it\u2019s your body and your autonomy doesn\u2019t disappear.

It was a generous and thoughtful gift BUT that doesn't obligate you to be comfortable participating when you feel exposed and vulnerable in essentially a medical setting, and you have the added pressure of balancing the happiness of each side of the family. \n\nWho exactly was insisting that his parents be present? Was it their expectation, as part of the gift, that they'd get to be present? Or did your fiancee introduce that idea as a way to 'thank' them for the gift? \n\nFrankly your fiancee is being TA here, he should be more supportive and considerate of your position. You simply should NOT feel pressured to do something like this if you just aren't comfortable, and receiving a generous gift shouldn't obligate you to.", "NTA. You are the only one that needs to be comfortable, and you aren't there to make anyone comfortable. You are in control of you, and not wanting to be seen in such a compromising position is completely fine. Let your fianc\u00e9e be mad. You haven't done anything wrong.", "So gross NTA.\n\n\nAre they going to expect to watch the birth, too? \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA\n\nThis was either a gift or it was something they bought for themselves that requires your participation without any input. \n\nHave you said to your in-laws, \u201clook I am not comfortable with my medical exams being a spectator sport. This is still my body & I get to say who gets to see the outside & inside of me. Now if this was really a gift to me, I would like to extend an invite to MIL to join my sister & fianc\u00e9 in the exam. We will share copies of the scan afterwards. If this was not a gift but something you wanted for yourselves, since it requires my body you should have checked with me first & been clear about the conditions\u201d. \n\nYou need to be paying attention to everyone\u2019s behavior right now. Does your fianc\u00e9 support you and does what he needs to to make you feel safe? Do your in-laws feel money allows them control over your life & your child? How they behave now & how they respond to you wanting bodily autonomy will tell you what your future will look like.", "NTA. \n\nThis isn't a present for you. This is a gift to themselves. \n\nAn ultrasound is, however, first and foremost, a medical procedure. Medical procedures don't generally double as entertainment. The comfort and consent of the patient come first, last, and everywhere in between. The same applies to birth, too.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do something that makes you uncomfortable", "NTA I think   \n\n\nYou have the right to feel uncomfortable but I feel like a conversation could of happened with your fiance that shouldn't of been so dismissive. I feel like your fiance should of heard you out better and that worries me for your future but hopefully it's not a regular thing  \n\n\nAlso if it's a 3D place they can stream the scan online, I did that for my family as they are in a different province from me.", "Just me but I would of suggested it just be you and your partner. Its your baby it should be a moment for both of you. \n\nNTA\n\nMaybe it was a waste of money but if you aren't comfortable with the in laws there they shouldn't be there.", "NTA you offered a valid compromise.  It\u2019s understandable you\u2019d be uncomfortable with FIL there under those circumstances.  It\u2019s not like you were trying to exclude both of them.", "NTA- you don't owe them anything.", "NTA-  Its a gift. It shouldn't come with entitlement. Your comfort is paramount in a situation like that. Lol your fianc\u00e9e is treating it like they bought you an amusement park ticket and they just wanted to come spend the day with you.  \n\nIts so weird that your fianc\u00e9e is mad at you. Most of the time its just the dad and the mom of the baby at the ultrasound and every else gets pictures. I'd try to figure out the underlying reasons for his anger cause its super not justified.", "Pretty sure this is a 3d ultrasound, just FYI, you can record and stream it. No one needs to be present in the room with you if you aren't comfortable.\n\nNTA, but there were better alternatives here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine not to allow anyone but your partner with you at ANY medical exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur partner is the AH.", "Nta and I think your sister is right, you fucked up. Only if your fiancee is really not on your side anyway. You picked a bad guy", "So this was a birthday present with strings attached?! \nA birthday present is meant to be yours to do whatever you wanna do with it. Its not a birhtday present when they impose themselfs! They are assholes for that! \n\nYour husband is also an asshole for not standying up for you! \n\nJust because you are pregnant with their grandson/your husband babies that doesnt mean you start loosing feelings and rights. You are still a human and you have every right to decide who you want with you in this kind of moments.\n\nNTA!", "NTA. \n\nHave you called the company and asked what is expected as far as dress during the scan? \n\nMany places just have you wear comfortable clothes (think elastic waistband pants/shorts and a tshirt and only the abdomen is exposed. \n\nI have 5 kids and I don't think I have ever gotten a glimpse of my underwear during an ultrasound. \n\nAt the end of the day, your comfort is what matters most.", "NTA  - When the gift was presented, did his parents make it clear that they expected to attend the appointment with you?  Did you discuss your objections at all with them, or was your fiance the go-between? \n\nDid you explain why you cancelled to your inlaws, or did you leave that to your fiance? \n\nYour fiance can be furious all he likes, you don't have to let anyone see you in  your underwear that  you don't want to see you in your underwear.", "NTA.  An ultrasound, even the fun 3D ones, is a medical procedure where you are in a vulnerable position and there's no promise that everything will go as planned.  You felt uncomfortable with your FIL there, which is super normal.  Hell, I wouldn't have wanted my MIL there either.  Your fianc\u00e9's reaction is a big red flag, as your request was to be expected and there's nothing for him to be mad about.  Be careful with him, and good luck.", "You do what\u2019s good for you.", "NTA but I don't think canceling it was the way to go about it. It's also odd to assume your father in law would look at you inappropriately. It's just an ultrasound, not a gyno exam, but I get your hesitation. \n\nAlso re: your fianc\u00e9 saying your dad was entitled to be there - no. They paid for it so you can see your baby, any other motive is unhealthy and selfish. An ultrasound is to make sure everything is okay. Your in laws need to chill tf out and you better set this boundary with your fianc\u00e9 if you want things to work out. \n\nYou're entitled to make sure you feel comfortable during the exam so if you believe you weren't going to feel comfortable then it's your right to do it or not. Regardless though you should seek out an ultrasound. I hope everything goes okay. I'm a bit worried about situation but I wish you the best.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your legs have nothing to do with an ultrasound. You for sure can wear pants and lift up your shirt or wear the gown as a shirt and shorts on pants as bottoms. At 18 weeks the baby is up very high and they won\u2019t need to go that low towards your pubic bone. \n\nOn a side note a lot of the older generation didn\u2019t get to see ultrasounds and think they\u2019re fascinating. My nana had never seen one and loved it. It makes it more real for some ppl. I say NAH", "NTA.

Red flag alert.  You have a fiance problem.  For him to be mad at you because you didn't want your FFIL to be there during a MEDICAL exam (and yes that is what this is) makes him a total AH. I would NOT be comfortable in that situation with my FIL either!", "Oddly, I kept thinking about this problem. And I wanted to add something.\n\nSo... with a son being his parents' only child, you are their only chance to somewhat experience what it may be like to have a daughter. That doesn't excuse the situation -- especially not your fiance, because from your replies I got a sense that he was the pushy one and if he had just stood by you and told your parents, your MIL and your sister are coming along everything would have been fine and you could have gone to the appointment. \n\nBut for you, it may be helpful for the future to think about this. You very much get to have boundaries and good on you for cancelling and setting them. But as long as they show care and love for you and not just their grandchild, maybe let them in a bit and allow them to treat you like the daughter they didn't get to have? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the fianc\u00e9:\n\nDude, shape up. Your future wife and child are your first allegiance now, and their comfort must come first or you will have a very unhappy marriage. Be on her side! Especially with something so infinitely reasonable. You have to be the glue here, you have to mediate conflicts better instead of making it so much worse by getting angry.\n\nAnd maybe most importantly: It's really not okay to argue that \"my FIL would only look at the screen, not my panties.\" That is reversing something pretty fundamental. Your future wife has a right to feel shy about her body and you are making it sound like she is the messed up one for suggesting your FIL would see her panties. NO! It's not about where exactly he looks. It's about his presence when she is in a vulnerable position. If you don't get that - ask yourself how you would feel about her going to shower at a gym and a few guys to step into that group shower... saying \"why are you bothered, we're not looking at your bits\". I know its an extreme example, but the idea is: don't put it on the person who desires physical autonomy and privacy to explain why she needs it. It's her right. No questions ask.

But if their requirement for the gift is that only *they* can be present, *no one* from your family can be there even if you want them to be, and you have to go through with it even if you're uncomfortable - that is 100% something they were doing for *themselves* and not for you.\n\nThat's not what a gift is.", "NTA.   I understand you would be very uncomfortable with FIL there and fiancee should have explained this to his parents.   I did wonder if FIL was excited since he probably didn't get to do these kind of things before.  It's your body and you need to be comfortable.", "NTA.

They overstepped and I\u2019m betting you\u2019re going to have to put your foot down about A LOT of things so start now.", "NTA\n\nThat wasn't a gift for you. It was a gift for themselves. If it was truly for you, they'd want you to be comfortable.\n\nI can forsee you needing to establish strong boundaries in the future.\n\nETA: You can also see the gender on these scans pretty clearly, so if you don't know or not telling, they'd be able to see depending on the position baby is in. Could be another reason they wanted to be there so badly?", "NTA. This wasn't a gift for you, it was a gift for themselves.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you can request a blanket to cover your panties. They only have to have the belly to do the ultra sound. I'm sure they will probably have nice heated ones. I love those.", "You better have the delivery room discussion. Who do you want in there?

This is similar to doing a couple's massage as a double date with your in-laws. It is nothing sexual, all the most critical parts are covered up, but it is perfectly acceptable to decline due to being uncomfortable with them seeing that much. In this case you should have even more veto rights than at a massage, since you are the only one being exposed.", "NTA. That isn't a gift you give without a confirmation from you that is what you want. Why are either of his parents attending? I can understand your mom or sister, but both his parents? This is a medical procedure, not a movie showing. I don't blame you for canceling. His parents are a bit entitled to schedule, pay for and expect to attend a medical procedure without consulting with you. You also get to see that your fiancee doesn't have your back. Good luck", "NTA but they definitely would have given you a blanket or a drape of some kind. Source: I\u2019ve had two kids and a lot of ultrasounds", "NTA... ultrasound shouldn't be a spectator sport and maybe I'm just old but these for-sport 3D ultrasounds are weird - I could see myself going to one and just bringing back lots of pictures but there's no way I'm laying on a table like a beached whale while my in laws stand next to me. Or even my own parents, that just feels kind of belittling for lack of a better term.", "Nta only took my partner to mine \nAnd once we got the photos we showed everyone and both family's were happy with that", "You should have the ultrasound to make sure that all is going well with your pregnancy, but why the heck would anyone other than the baby's father be there for it?

It is your body. It is your choice who gets to be in the room for medical appointments including fancy ultrasounds and the birth. Your body is not a free spectacle because you are carrying a baby. That\u2019s not a free override because it\u2019s their grandchild or they paid. They lost money because of their own stubbornness. Set boundaries now and hold tight. You don\u2019t owe them a damn penny.", "NTA.  Good grief, an expectant mother's body should not be subjected to peep shows for an audience.

Otherwise, it was a present for them at the expense of your comfort. 'nuff said", "Nta\nIt's not a gift if you have no control over it.", "On no. You need to nip this boundary stomping in the bud. You get to decide you sees you undressed or half-dressed, and no one else gets to have an opinion about that.", "NTA Your fianc\u00e9 does not get to dictate who gets to see you in any state of undress! It doesn't matter that FIL said he won't look. You aren't comfortable! Fianc\u00e9, you need to get over it, and don't you dare try to dictate who gets to be in the delivery room. That is your bride-to-be's choice too!", "Info: would you feel uncomfortable wearing a bikini with FIL around? \n\nUnfortuantly the reality of being pregnant is that every doctor you meet will have their hand in your vajayjay in less than 20min.", "This is extremely  \"Rosemary's Baby\"-ish....", "NTA \n\nIf it is present, you can use it however you like. But have you thought about a compromise:\n\nCan you get a recording of your 3D scan and watch it with your in-laws?", "All of it sounds weird to me, but then I didn't realize that multiple family members could/do attend any kind of ultrasound appointment. I actually didn't think the FIL wanting to be there was stand-out weird, so much as any of the in-laws being there. Is this a new thing that people do as a matter of course? Special ultrasound viewing parties?", "FWIW, every US I\u2019ve had (high risk pregnancies / uncooperative babies, so I\u2019ve had A LOT) they cover your bottom half with a sheet that\u2019s tucked into your shorts/panties to keep from getting the US gel on your clothes.\n\nBut FIL likely wants to be present to see his future grandchild? Not that odd?", "I agree with the NTA, but I don't understand why you're questioning why the FIL/anybody but the fiance wants to be present. It's the child of their son, why wouldn't he/they want to be present?\n\nAlso, why question the FIL specifically and not the MIL?", "This is exactly right. It\u2019s not typical to bring fathers in law to any sort of prenatal/OB doctor appointment! It\u2019s absurd that that would be expected of you.\n\nIf the gift was for you then it should be YOUR decision who to bring, 100%. If they expected to be in the room  while you\u2019re vulnerable on the table, then it\u2019s not a gift for you it\u2019s a self-serving request. \n\nFrankly your in laws aren\u2019t really even the problem here, your husband has the wrong take. He should be more respectful of your privacy and that needs to be addressed immediately, because you\u2019re going to get increasingly more vulnerable during labor, delivery, and postpartum", "To be fair it sounds like OP was fine with the gift just not the audience part.", "This sounds like a fianc\u00e9 thing not an in laws thing. It doesn\u2019t sound like they tried to use their disappointment to manipulate her or anything, they just sounded a bit bummed. Which is understandable if they are excited and looking forward to the baby, they\u2019re allowed to have some feelings, but it doesn\u2019t come across that *they* are prioritizing those feelings above OP\u2019s feelings, it\u2019s just fianc\u00e9 who is doing that.", "Yep. I read this as a fianc\u00e9 problem not an in-law problem.", "I read it as fianc\u00e9 is the one making an issue out of it.", "I didn't remove a single item of clothing for mine. Just pulled up my shirt.", "Not really the issue. She still feels exposed and does not need to let her in laws see her in that state.", "We did one of these with both of my kids. All 4 grandparents were in the room to see the kids in 3D. It was really cool. But I wore a pair of yoga pants and they just pulled my shirt up a bit to expose my belly - I was still fully clothed. There is no chance I would have had a family experience like that if I was required to be in just my underwear.", "[removed]", "I would suggest with a 3D ultrasound not doing it so early if that\u2019s the case, though. The pictures can come out way better closer to 32 weeks", ">is it FIL that is insisting or is it Hubby won't tell him your issues?\n\nUnless I'm misunderstanding, [FIL was disappointed but understood](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165gpxf/comment/jydw9zb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), OP still decided to cancel it anyway due to them being disappointed. Doesn't sound like FIL was insistent at all.", "Since op calls it a special ultrasound and the in-laws are doing it as a birthday present, it sounds like a 3D ultrasound. Places that do them usually provide a video, pictures, and they make sure to get a good picture of the baby\u2019s face. It\u2019s not like a medical ultrasound, where they check the baby\u2019s growth, it\u2019s just for fun.\n\nWhen I was pregnant (7years ago) i did it with basically my whole family there. The first time my son wasn\u2019t in a good position to see his face, so they scheduled me another session for free. At one point both my grandmas, my grandpa, and my parents (and obviously my husband) were there.", "Yeah, I've done two elective ultrasounds and they weren't done at hospital and I didn't even remove any clothing items.", "If she's not comfortable - she's not comfortable. Her body her choice. Just bc they paid for it  - doesn't mean they get to be part of it. It's still a medical appointment. Everyone has different comfort levels. This seems presumptuous and not understanding what a gift is.", "Well, I was originally thinking of the ultrasound I went to when my wife was pregnant, which involved a probe getting inserted. Another commenter thinks this is a different type of ultrasound that doesn't involve that. But either way, it's invasive. This is her medical appointment. And they can give you printouts of images, etc, from an ultrasound.\n\nFIL rather than MIL: because she specifically said not comfortable lying around in panties in front of her *father* in law. If she's not comfortable doing that then why the hell is anyone in the family demanding that she do, especially this \"furious\" fiance.", "I suspect that some of this is because OP herself doesn't seem uncomfortable with MIL being there, but is uncomfortable with FIL being there.", "This is NOT a prenatal OB visit. It's to an ultrasound center that does 3D ultrasounds just because people want to see their fetus before it's born. You're covered up. Her undies won't be exposed. I personally thinking doing them at all is a little creepy, but people who do them do have family members attend. That part's not weird", "Why couldn\u2019t you just wear sweatpants or leggings?  I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d have to be in your panties only.", "Nah. They're just a business on the side of the road. Mine cost $85 and I didn't remove a single item of clothing. Just lifted my shirt", "They should\u2019ve checked with that before scheduling the appointment though", "Ah, interesting. I have definitely heard of and seen pictures from 3D ultrasounds, but I didn't realize it was something multiple people attended like that. I thought they were done like regular ultrasounds with the mom and maybe one other person there (usually the partner) and then pictures were printed for friends and family the way regular ultrasound pics are sometimes given. Thanks for the explanation!", "Yes, I agree with all of that.", "I think she's uncomfortable because she think she'll just be in her gown and underwear. Tech are accustomed to making sure people aren't exposed. She can wear something like yoga pants, or they can drape her so that she's in no way exposed (beyond her belly obviously). She should check with the service provider before saying she's uncomfortable without knowing if what she's imagining is correct. (Also, it's not really germane, but the \"too early\" to be excited at 18 weeks is odd. That's almost halfway through the pregnancy, and this is their first grandchild. Of course, they're excited.)", "At 18 weeks, it should be an external ultrasound, but it's still exposing for the mother.", "Okay yeah I agree with that. I just don't think it's weird for the grandparents to want to be there for this.\n\nAnd fair on the FIL. I should not have been making assumptions about you, about why you specifically called out FIL and not MIL. That's my bad.", ">u can also wear a swimming suit\n\n...not... really...", "You're missing the point that it should be her choice. \n\nPeople shouldn't be able to pay their way into being involved. Or feel entitled to be involved in certain matters. \n\nI wouldn't want my FIL there. Or MIL. Everyone is different and respect that instead of making all these excuses of what they could have done."]}
