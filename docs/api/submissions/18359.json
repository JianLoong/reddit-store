When I was 12 my father got married to my stepmother and they had my sister (7). I have always primarily lived with my mother my whole life and the few days a week I spent at his house I was expected to complete most household tasks from the age of about 6 years old. I also often lacked basic things I needed like shampoo and clothes for school and for a long while my own bed, it never felt like home to me.\n\n When my sister was born, he became infatuated with having a \"legitimate\" family and \"legitimate\" child and began to portray himself as the \"perfect father\". He would get mad at me for small or nonexistent issues he would make up and say that \"everyone in the house was tired of you\" and \"My family is being disrupted by you\" (he said this because I mopped the floor and therefore the floor was wet). He always made sure to complain to me about dispising my mother and the responsibilities of caring for me while he gushed about his love for his wife and my sister.\n\nMy father is well off and when I was 18 he purchased an older car for me. I was always immensely grateful for the car and told him regularly. He lives over an hour away and told me he bought it because it isn't fair he had to drive to pick me up and it was about time I did it myself. I commuted 3 hours a week to see him. And everytime he complained, because I was in my own bedroom, didn't clean enough (eventhough I only stayed 2 days a week and didn't make the messes), and wasn't interested in driving 3 hours to visit only for them to take off to party and leave me to babysit my sister. After about 3 months the car began to stall out randomly and frequently. I told him about it repeatedly for 5 months and he could not care less.\n\n One night I nearly got into a severe accident and called him nearly in tears, he got angry and called me ungrateful that the car wasn't good enough for me. It of course was but as great as it was I didn't want to die in it. He blew up about me being ungrateful and spoiled.  He said that he was taking the car because I did not deserve it to which I simply responded alright as I know it is his right and I was grateful to ever have it. I asked him to calm down so we could talk properly, but by the end of the call he said he was done with me and to not visit, see or call him anymore. \n\nSince then I have honored his request to not come to his house. He has since gaslit me and denied his outburst. This is not the first time he's lashed out like this, but for me it was the last. Becoming my class' valedictorian, cleaning his house, graduating high school with my associates degree, never getting in trouble in my life only to be told how much of a burden I am. I finally got my own car 2 weeks ago without his help, now he insults me about not caring about my family and going to his house. But honestly I've simply had enough.", "created_utc": 1685256279, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ttiwp/aitah_for_refusing_to_visit_my_fathers_house/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being an AH, pretending the conversation never happened.\n\nI've been out of the house over 20 years now and every once in a while I'll get a guilt trip phone call.. while I never went NC, I just give him the love he deserves. He sends my daughter Christmas gifts, and he gets thank yous and photos.. that's about it.\n\nHe's basically permanently living in the FO phase of FAFO.", "Go to court talk to a judge and get him for being a abuser.

I am so sorry that your father is an absolute jerk and used you as the household servant.", "Thank you very much.", "He started guilt tripping me for not staying at his house as soon as other family members caught wind of what happened and his falsified image began to crumble. Which as I see it isn't my problem.", "Yep, I definitely see that now. I edited my post before your reply so it will probably look out of context. \n\nUltimately I've always felt that family doesn't get additional privileges in the \"treat you like crap\" department. When it comes to that, they are just people you were lucky (or unlucky) to have to live with growing up. If my friend treated me like that, they wouldn't be my friend. Family shouldn't be any different. (IMO)", "NTA \n\nHe's abusive.  Stay NC", "NTA. I don't think the relationship is salvageable. He simply don't care about you.", "Definitely NTA!  Coming from a family with a father like yours, I\u2019ve come to realize that he was the issue, not you. He\u2019ll continue to make things up to others as to why you don\u2019t come around or have any contact and play the victim card.

I just hope you can maintain a relationship with your half-sister in the meantime.\n\n\nYou do realise that it's meant to be the step-mother that's evil, not the biological father, right?

Keep strengthening your independence.  that man never treated you like a daughter, just an unpaid servant.  You owe him nothing but contempt.  Block him everywhere and move on.  When he wants you to move in and take care of them in their old age, you can laugh in their faces and tell them sure, it will cost $25,000 a month, paid in advance.", "NTA but he isn\u2019t interested in having a healthy relationship with you, he wants free labor. The way he treats you is more of a reflection of how he feels about himself than you. He needs to deal with his own crap and stop projecting onto others. Until he\u2019s in a place where he can do this, you can\u2019t have a good relationship with him. Drop the rope and go NC. As someone that also has dad issues, find a good therapist. Break the cycle of abuse so you don\u2019t end up like him.", "NTA- I think it's time for a non-contact.\nIf you have any shared family that you do visit like aunt's, uncles, grandparents. I'm sure they know if they've seen this but I would just talk to them first and explain why like an adult.\n\nTell them about the conversation your father had and how traumatic was on you and that you just need to take time for yourself and your own mental health.", "NTA- I grew up very similarly (like almost exact same father behavior and comments) I\u2019m so sorry you are dealing with this because I know how hard it can be. Going NC was the best and healthiest thing I ever did in my life and I\u2019ve never regretted it. I went NC at 14, I am almost 32 now and like I said, I have never regretted the decision to protect my self and to have better standards for how I allow others to treat me.\nPlease go NC and don\u2019t listen to the gaslighting.", "Oh, wow.

I also often lacked basic things I needed like shampoo and clothes for school and for a long while my own bed, it never felt like home to me.\n\nYeah that's because he was using you (a literal child!) as a maid service and also not doing the things a parent is like, bare minimum supposed to do.", "NTA .... OP what you described is a form of ABUSE. Your father is lucky he wasn't reported to Child and Family services. CUT HIM OUT and go be happy. Just because they're blood doesn't mean they need to be family.", "Block him and be done with him. You accomplished so much and have a good head on your shoulders. NC is hard but worth it. Going no contact isn't about punishing or hurting that person, it is about protecting yourself. Your mental health is worth more than a fake relationship with this man.", "NTA. You're doing what he told you to do. He doesn't get to deny his horrible behavior. I would go No Contact for your own mental health. He's not acting like a father to you, only your half sister. The 'gift' of the car was not selfless either and he didn't a reliable vehicle. Be proud of yourself.

Keep being awesome, and have a beautiful now and abuse free future.", "Probably the real reason is that he misses the free childcare and maid service", "NTA, he decided to cut you out, now the old fart is reaping the consequences. No bad parent can ever have their cake and eat it.", "NTA.  Go NC.  Nothing but more heartache for you there.", "OP, you're NTA.  Don't allow him or any others to guilt trip you for cutting him off.  You don't have to keep a toxic person in your life because they're \"family\".  People always try to guilt the kid into forgiving the parents, but they never address the parent's bad behavior.  Just because you share DNA with someone doesn't mean you have to put up with their nonsense or keep them in your life.\n\nI had parents very similar to what you're describing, and cutting them out of my life was the best thing I ever did for my (and my kids) mental health.  Block him on everything, don't respond to any attempts to contact you, and don't get into any discussions with anyone who is trying to rope you into talking about him.  He can't insult you if he can't reach you by phone.\n\nOnce you get yourself together, then you can have low contact with him, but only if you want.  Or you may realize your life is so peaceful now and you may want to keep him out of your life permanently.", "NTA he sounds kinda similar to my father and I can assure you that you will be so much better off without him in your life.

It hurts, we know, but this guy does not appreciate you and that is his loss. \n\nThink about what you want to invest in the coming few years.

Your accomplishments are amazing!  Congratulations to you and your mom!  I am so sorry that your sperm donor treated you this way.  It was not your fault in any way.  He did those things because there is something wrong with him, not you, obviously.  \n\nUnfortunately, being abused in this way can cause negative effects in your future relationships with friends, bosses, romantic partners, etc., so I hope you will not hesitate to seek therapy if you feel you are struggling in any of these areas. \n\nGood luck, OP!  You deserve to be happy and feel good about yourself!", "NTA - Reading this absolutely infuriated me.

Congratulations on all your accomplishments! Keep moving forward in life and be good to others. Go NC with your father immediately. Do t look back. Life is short, enjoy it!!!", "NTA - Oh honey . .  I'm so sorry your father is like that. However, he is responsible for his own actions and you are not responsible for how he is. It took me a lifetime to realize that about my own parents. You keep being you and just never expect anything from him . .  as he has nothing to give. You haven't done anything wrong and I see that you have tried so hard. STop trying and expend your energies on the ones who love you and especially on yourself. You need to take care of yourself because you deserve to be cherished.", "Agreed NTA but sperm donors don\u2019t have any obligation to the child other than providing genetic material (and relevant family medical history), that\u2019s kind of the whole point of the process. Assholes like this guy **do** have obligations to love, care for and support their child that they are failing to live up to", "Thank you, it means alot.", "You can't force those things from someone who only loves themselves.", "This guy is acting like a sperm donor then."]}
