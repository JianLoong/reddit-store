When I was 12 my father got married to my stepmother and they had my sister (7). I have always primarily lived with my mother my whole life and the few days a week I spent at his house I was expected to complete most household tasks from the age of about 6 years old. I also often lacked basic things I needed like shampoo and clothes for school and for a long while my own bed, it never felt like home to me.\n\n When my sister was born, he became infatuated with having a \"legitimate\" family and \"legitimate\" child and began to portray himself as the \"perfect father\". He would get mad at me for small or nonexistent issues he would make up and say that \"everyone in the house was tired of you\" and \"My family is being disrupted by you\" (he said this because I mopped the floor and therefore the floor was wet). He always made sure to complain to me about dispising my mother and the responsibilities of caring for me while he gushed about his love for his wife and my sister.\n\nMy father is well off and when I was 18 he purchased an older car for me. I was always immensely grateful for the car and told him regularly. He lives over an hour away and told me he bought it because it isn't fair he had to drive to pick me up and it was about time I did it myself. I commuted 3 hours a week to see him. And everytime he complained, because I was in my own bedroom, didn't clean enough (eventhough I only stayed 2 days a week and didn't make the messes), and wasn't interested in driving 3 hours to visit only for them to take off to party and leave me to babysit my sister. After about 3 months the car began to stall out randomly and frequently. I told him about it repeatedly for 5 months and he could not care less.\n\n One night I nearly got into a severe accident and called him nearly in tears, he got angry and called me ungrateful that the car wasn't good enough for me. It of course was but as great as it was I didn't want to die in it. He blew up about me being ungrateful and spoiled.  He said that he was taking the car because I did not deserve it to which I simply responded alright as I know it is his right and I was grateful to ever have it. I asked him to calm down so we could talk properly, but by the end of the call he said he was done with me and to not visit, see or call him anymore. \n\nSince then I have honored his request to not come to his house. He has since gaslit me and denied his outburst. This is not the first time he's lashed out like this, but for me it was the last. Becoming my class' valedictorian, cleaning his house, graduating high school with my associates degree, never getting in trouble in my life only to be told how much of a burden I am. I finally got my own car 2 weeks ago without his help, now he insults me about not caring about my family and going to his house. But honestly I've simply had enough.", "created_utc": 1685256279, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ttiwp/aitah_for_refusing_to_visit_my_fathers_house/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t need him or his abusive, gaslighting ways and it\u2019s high time that he learn that if you don\u2019t treat people well they won\u2019t keep subjecting themselves to him. I agree with the people suggesting you go no contact. You don\u2019t need to constantly try to be \u2018enough\u2019 for someone else who sounds broken and miserable.

I think that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s so mad you got your own car - he can\u2019t use that anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t know how money is for you, but try to see a therapist so you can talk this out.
