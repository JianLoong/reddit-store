She has a group of friends I actually quite like, however they are much younger than her (18-22). One of my wife\u2019s closest friend is a guy who\u2019s much younger than her and started dating a girl at a large state college. She is Bi and has said multiple times that she finds my wife very attractive and would love a gay experience with her.\n\nNot long after we got married my wife was invited to go stay the night at the college with her friend to visit the girl, and before asking me about it she happily accepted invitation. I overheard this conversation so I discussed my discomfort of the situation later in a private setting. I never said she couldn\u2019t go, I just said I was uncomfortable, but trusted her to set boundaries while she was visiting the college. She was initially upset that I was uncomfortable in the first place, but later apologized and said she wasn\u2019t going.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, I just left town to start training for a new very lucrative job. Right before I left she asked if she could go to the college again, but this time with a bigger group of friends this time. I explained again to her that I trusted her and to just be careful.\n\nWell the night she goes out to the college she gets extremely drunk, I\u2019m asleep because I have a very early morning of training, but she sends me a handful of drunk texts. One of them being that she decided to go streaking across the field of the college. This definitely upset me. After I read the texts I sent her a text asking her to text me when she wakes up so I know that she is safe and okay. \n\nShe texted me later that morning, saying she felt bad for how drunk she got, that she blacked out and didn\u2019t remember getting back to the place she was staying, which also upset me. She asked if I was mad about the streaking which I told her I was upset by it. She said it was a tradition that she did when she was in college and that she wanted to do it again for fun. I told her that the way I see marriage, that our bodies should be private to our relationship unless we talk about it to each other beforehand. Maybe I\u2019d feel different if I was asked, or I was there, or even also participated.\n\nOverall, I just feel like this validated the reasons I was uncomfortable with the whole situation in the beginning. I knew she would be talked into drinking way more than she should and that she might do something of this nature that would upset me. Plus I don\u2019t like the \u201cit\u2019s a tradition\u201d excuse cause she graduated college almost 3 years ago and never went to this school. She said she and the girls she did it with, including the bi girl that is attracted to her, made the guys there turn around while they streaked across the field.

Penal Code 314 guarantees that a person who, \u201cexposes his person, or the private parts, thereof, in any public place,\u201d will be guilty of a misdemeanor offense.\n\nIn California for example\n\nIn Penal Code \u00a7 314 PC, California law defines the crime of indecent exposure as willfully exposing your naked body or genitals, in a public place, to others who would be offended or annoyed by it.\r  \n\r  \nIndecent exposure is generally prosecuted as a misdemeanor and punishable by up to 6 months in county jail as well as a 10-year sex offender registration requirement.\r  \n\r  \nThe language of the law states that:\r  \n\r  \n314. Every person who willfully and lewdly, either:\r  \n\r  \n1. Exposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby; or,\r  \n\r  \n2. Procures, counsels, or assists any person so to expose himself or take part in any model artist exhibition, or to make any other exhibition of himself to public view, or the view of any number of persons, such as is offensive to decency, or is adapted to excite to vicious or lewd thoughts or acts,\r  \n\r  \nis guilty of a misdemeanor.\r  \n\r  \nEvery person who violates subdivision 1 of this section after having entered, without consent, an inhabited dwelling house, or trailer coach as defined in Section 635 of the Vehicle Code, or the inhabited portion of any other building, is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, or in the county jail not exceeding one year.\r  \n\r  \nUpon the second and each subsequent conviction under subdivision 1 of this section, or upon a first conviction under subdivision 1 of this section after a previous conviction under Section 288, every person so convicted is guilty of a felony, and is punishable by imprisonment in state prison.\n\nPenalties\r  \n\r  \nWhile a California \u201cindecent exposure\u201d conviction may not seem like a very serious offense, the repercussions can be serious.\r  \n\r  \nIn most cases, a first indecent exposure conviction subjects you to misdemeanor penalties of\r  \n\r  \nup to six (6) months in county jail and\r  \na fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000). 1 2 3\r  \nA second offense is a felony and can lead to a California state prison sentence.4\r  \n\r  \nBut perhaps worst of all, a Penal Code 314 PC conviction subjects you to a minimum ten (10) year duty to register as a Tier one California sex offender. (California Senate Bill 384 recently created a three-tier sex registration system that reduced the registration requirement for indecent exposure to ten (10) years. It used to be for life.)5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think at 26 years old your wife should know better. She is streaking on a campus that she is not even a student at so add criminal trespass. \n\nYou two are married any legal problems she gets herself into - affect you because crimes cost a shit ton of money. And if she caught a sex offend status for 10 years that will dramatically affect a lot multiple areas of your lives long term.\n\nNo consideration for your well being of which is required in a marriage since you guys are legally bound to each other.
