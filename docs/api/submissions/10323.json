She has a group of friends I actually quite like, however they are much younger than her (18-22). One of my wife\u2019s closest friend is a guy who\u2019s much younger than her and started dating a girl at a large state college. She is Bi and has said multiple times that she finds my wife very attractive and would love a gay experience with her.\n\nNot long after we got married my wife was invited to go stay the night at the college with her friend to visit the girl, and before asking me about it she happily accepted invitation. I overheard this conversation so I discussed my discomfort of the situation later in a private setting. I never said she couldn\u2019t go, I just said I was uncomfortable, but trusted her to set boundaries while she was visiting the college. She was initially upset that I was uncomfortable in the first place, but later apologized and said she wasn\u2019t going.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, I just left town to start training for a new very lucrative job. Right before I left she asked if she could go to the college again, but this time with a bigger group of friends this time. I explained again to her that I trusted her and to just be careful.\n\nWell the night she goes out to the college she gets extremely drunk, I\u2019m asleep because I have a very early morning of training, but she sends me a handful of drunk texts. One of them being that she decided to go streaking across the field of the college. This definitely upset me. After I read the texts I sent her a text asking her to text me when she wakes up so I know that she is safe and okay. \n\nShe texted me later that morning, saying she felt bad for how drunk she got, that she blacked out and didn\u2019t remember getting back to the place she was staying, which also upset me. She asked if I was mad about the streaking which I told her I was upset by it. She said it was a tradition that she did when she was in college and that she wanted to do it again for fun. I told her that the way I see marriage, that our bodies should be private to our relationship unless we talk about it to each other beforehand. Maybe I\u2019d feel different if I was asked, or I was there, or even also participated.\n\nOverall, I just feel like this validated the reasons I was uncomfortable with the whole situation in the beginning. I knew she would be talked into drinking way more than she should and that she might do something of this nature that would upset me. Plus I don\u2019t like the \u201cit\u2019s a tradition\u201d excuse cause she graduated college almost 3 years ago and never went to this school. She said she and the girls she did it with, including the bi girl that is attracted to her, made the guys there turn around while they streaked across the field.

Penal Code 314 guarantees that a person who, \u201cexposes his person, or the private parts, thereof, in any public place,\u201d will be guilty of a misdemeanor offense.\n\nIn California for example\n\nIn Penal Code \u00a7 314 PC, California law defines the crime of indecent exposure as willfully exposing your naked body or genitals, in a public place, to others who would be offended or annoyed by it.\r  \n\r  \nIndecent exposure is generally prosecuted as a misdemeanor and punishable by up to 6 months in county jail as well as a 10-year sex offender registration requirement.\r  \n\r  \nThe language of the law states that:\r  \n\r  \n314. Every person who willfully and lewdly, either:\r  \n\r  \n1. Exposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby; or,\r  \n\r  \n2. Procures, counsels, or assists any person so to expose himself or take part in any model artist exhibition, or to make any other exhibition of himself to public view, or the view of any number of persons, such as is offensive to decency, or is adapted to excite to vicious or lewd thoughts or acts,\r  \n\r  \nis guilty of a misdemeanor.\r  \n\r  \nEvery person who violates subdivision 1 of this section after having entered, without consent, an inhabited dwelling house, or trailer coach as defined in Section 635 of the Vehicle Code, or the inhabited portion of any other building, is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, or in the county jail not exceeding one year.\r  \n\r  \nUpon the second and each subsequent conviction under subdivision 1 of this section, or upon a first conviction under subdivision 1 of this section after a previous conviction under Section 288, every person so convicted is guilty of a felony, and is punishable by imprisonment in state prison.\n\nPenalties\r  \n\r  \nWhile a California \u201cindecent exposure\u201d conviction may not seem like a very serious offense, the repercussions can be serious.\r  \n\r  \nIn most cases, a first indecent exposure conviction subjects you to misdemeanor penalties of\r  \n\r  \nup to six (6) months in county jail and\r  \na fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000). 1 2 3\r  \nA second offense is a felony and can lead to a California state prison sentence.4\r  \n\r  \nBut perhaps worst of all, a Penal Code 314 PC conviction subjects you to a minimum ten (10) year duty to register as a Tier one California sex offender. (California Senate Bill 384 recently created a three-tier sex registration system that reduced the registration requirement for indecent exposure to ten (10) years. It used to be for life.)5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think at 26 years old your wife should know better. She is streaking on a campus that she is not even a student at so add criminal trespass. \n\nYou two are married any legal problems she gets herself into - affect you because crimes cost a shit ton of money. And if she caught a sex offend status for 10 years that will dramatically affect a lot multiple areas of your lives long term.\n\nNo consideration for your well being of which is required in a marriage since you guys are legally bound to each other.

That's all fine too, but just because she's his partner doesn't mean she has to listen to everything he says.\nAltho by now I'm tending more to ESH tbh.", "Yes you do", "Yeah, I can't really call anyone an asshole here because they're young and seem to want to do different things.\n\nI understand that she's young and wants to hang with the young kids but at some point she's going to have to realize that she's the one out of collage, married and living elsewhere. \n\nUsually a marriage means a new beginning. That's the talk they really should be having; what beginning is that?\n\nNAH, just young people being young people (fuck I'm ~~old~~ mature).", "Okay. Neat for you.", "She's 26. If she wants to party every weekend, she can. That's her prerogative.", "I can\u2019t even imagine the pain and turmoil that has caused in her life. I thank her for her service and it\u2019s a shame that her service caused such harm. Especially that they would fight to not protect her, when she so willingly was protecting us.", "You can call me brah, bruh, Bruv or brav. But bro is too far\u2026 lol", ">His wife knows how to say no, after all.\n\nHer getting black out drunk and streaking would seem to say she doesn't know how to say no.", "Exactly my thinking. \n\nEither he trusts his wife, or he doesn't. Doesn't sound like he does.", "Shes 26 and married which means you don\u2019t just do whatever you want, you do have to compromise on some shit. When I was 26 I wasn\u2019t married so there was less responsibility and my life wasn\u2019t tied legally/financially/emotionally into anyone else\u2019s. If she\u2019s trying to party every weekend at a college town maybe she shouldn\u2019t have gotten married", "That's your advice?", "No, im 26 and unmarried. If I want to go out parying every weekend that MY prerogative. If your 26 and married you no longer have that ability. You made the adult decision to become a family unit, not a wild individual. While she technically does have the right to do these things OP deffinetly has the right to let her ass sit in the drunk tank and find her own way home when shit catches up to her, and the right to divorce her \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThere's a diffrence between what someone can technically do and what someone should be doing.", "But yeah you\u2019re NTA, you\u2019re just protecting your wife. You can\u2019t trust anyone in the world and it gets more chaotic by the day. Good luck on your career, I hope your wife understands your valid concerns.", "I served in the Iraq war and came home with PTSD myself so we have been each others support channel over the years. Some people call us co/dependent but in our case it\u2019s healthy and necessary.", "Or she said yes to both.", "So because she's married, she can't hang out with friends on weekends?", "That a 20-something enjoy life?", "Why does someone who is married no longer have the prerogative of hanging out with friends on the weekend? \n\nWhat drunk tank?", "Sounds to me like a beautiful marriage. Thank you for your service as well and taking the time to respond to my post.", "Oh come on now. Hanging out with friends and streaking on a college campus that she never even attended are two different things. If she got arrested, OP would be the one bailing her out. I hang out with my friends on the weekends and so does my partner", "She's not in college anymore and there is a difference about what you can do and what you should do. She's not a wild single college girl anymore she is an adult married women.", "I don't deal with \"what ifs\". \n\nStreaking isn't parading around naked.", "So \"adult\" married women can't hang out with friends?", "Well before I go out drinking I say what if I drive and drink too much, so that influences me to get an Uber. Before I decide to go streaking I say what if I get arrested doing it, so then I decide not to do it. What ifs are great for good decision making.\n\nIm not defining streaking for you but where I live it is indecent exposure. It\u2019s not a crazy idea to think she could\u2019ve gotten arrested. She didn\u2019t and that\u2019s great but it\u2019s not great risk taking behavior", ">Streaking isn't parading around naked.\n \nLiterally, it is.", "She is acting immature. She thinks it's OK to flaunt her body in public when she is in a committed relationship. Noone ever said that she couldn't hang out with friends, but what she did is NOT the same as going to a movie with her friends or anything else. She needs to accept she's not in college anymore and move on.", "She didn't get arrested. So I'm not going to go down an unnecessary path. \n\nThanks for sharing YOUR tips. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "Nah, you're running naked quickly so you don't get caught. You're not running to be seen."]}
