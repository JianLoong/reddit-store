I'll never understand the people who \\*think that the world should revolve around them. I paid for a seat just as they paid for theirs. And location of the seat determines its price.

That makes zero sense! \n\nNTA", "Nta", "The auDACITY!!!\n\nNTA", "Nta. Can't everyone pick a seat to stay on while buying a ticket? Also the husband is really petty.", "NTA. You are not obligated to change seats.

Nope. Nopity nope.", "I actually did wish them a good rest of the day in their language at the end of their flight.... the look on her face was priceless.", "I am sure he said it to save face and possibly also humiliate his wife. I think it was BS.", "Oh I think it was the hubby trying to save face explaining why he switched for his wife, because apparently,  which husband would let his wife have the better seat?", "Because (and I'm just guessing here), she doesn't. Her husband just said that because he's mad at her for making him switch seats.", "Sometimes the airlines do things that screw things up - like switch to a smaller plane or whatever. \n\nOP definitely didn\u2019t need to switch seats - just saying that saying everyone can pick a seat, and it isn\u2019t that straightforward", "My feeling is that there is nothing wrong with a flight attendant nicely requesting ONE TIME a switch for a better seat.

I will happily change seats to accommodate a family and child as I always appreciated when someone did that when I flew with my young child. Otherwise?

No. Not a chance.", "I was on a long haul overnight flight recently, checked in too late and got stuck in a middle seat, got there to find two Korean friends either side who I immediately offered to swap with one so they can sit together.

It's really gaming the system. I almost never think someone is TA for refusing to switch seats on planes.", "Exactly. And everyone knows middle seats cost less. Also, why ask for a window if you need to poop? Makes no sense.", "That was the sweet revenge on the husband's side towards his wife. Jeee", "She didnt get up once lol", "Yep. Lol", "Really?

You dont have to answer if you dont feel comfortable.", "My first thought too, wth.", "Hah. My spouse and I often sit opposite each other or in front/behind each other because we both prefer aisles.

I\u2019ll be the first to admit, my ex and I used to book seats in the window and aisle on the same row because they\u2019re better and no one wants the middle and if they never got booked, we had a row to ourselves. If someone booked it, we accepted that if we asked if one of us could switch and someone says no, we\u2019re not sitting next to each other. \n\nIt\u2019s trying to game the system a bit, yes, but I would never insist that someone trade seats with me.", "She was definitely full of shit. NTA.", "NTA, if she had the runs why would she want a window seat and be further away from the bathroom and more people in the way. She is the AH for asking. Why would you want to sit in the middle of a married couple. Weird.", "NTA she was trying to bully you.", "NTA - switching seat requests are never appropriate anymore. Buy the seat you want. End of story, unless you are offered something better, but it seems that is never the case.", "NTA and for the husband to have said that to you, I\u2019m pretty sure he was tired of her shenanigans.", "Had a couple today that were seated accross the isle from each other. The guy asked the guy in middle seat next to my window seat if he'd trade so his girlfriend could sit with him, which the guy in middle gladly did.   Then they asked me if I wouldn't mind switching so she could look out the window since it was her first flight.\n\nIdk if it actually was or not, but she looked excited and I got an isle seat instead of the middle.  I didn't get to see any sights but I fly almost weekly and always have a window seat, so I let them have it this time.  But I usually don't.  I immediately put in earbuds when I sit down and for most part don't have any issues.", "NTA. That husband should be your friend now. Both of you don't seem to like that woman", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a woman and I\u2019m perfectly capable of recognizing middle seats and avoiding booking them if I don\u2019t want to sit in one. \n\nAnd no one flies well in any kind of coach seat.

It seems that it was her husband's poor choice of a way to save face, and that he was upset he needed to switch with her.

Thanks ever so much!*\"", "Agreed.  It\u2019s gotten so out of hand that at this point, I think you\u2019re T A even for asking anymore.", "No idea if this is true, but I read about a couple that would buy the window and isle, and then if no one got the middle they had a lot of room, but if someone did they would offer to swap so they sat together but the middle seat person got a better seat.\n\nI'd like to think it is true, and NTA", "And throw in a Bless your heart while you\u2019re at it.", "My boyfriend and I do this when we fly. I don\u2019t mind sitting in the middle, but prefer an aisle with the middle open. If someone does book the middle between us, I\u2019ll offer my aisle seat to them and swap. If they want the middle, they\u2019re welcome to keep it lol", "My husband and I do\nThis. But it\u2019s mainly because I like isle and he likes window.", "My wife and I have done this countless times. \n\nBook a window and an aisle, and hope nobody sits in the middle\u2026 and if they do, they are always happy to switch out with one of us. My wife is tiny and doesn\u2019t mind the middle seat at all.\n\nThe one weird one was where some guy sat down in the middle\u2026 and did not want to move! He preferred the middle, so my wife and I sat \u201capart\u201d lol"]}
