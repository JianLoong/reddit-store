I'll never understand the people who \\*think that the world should revolve around them. I paid for a seat just as they paid for theirs. And location of the seat determines its price. IF she had diarrhea, she should've asked to switch with someone closer to the bathroom :D", "Wait.  So she has diarrhea and wanted to switch to a **window** seat? That makes zero sense! \n\nNTA", "Nta", "The auDACITY!!!\n\nNTA", "Nta. Can't everyone pick a seat to stay on while buying a ticket? Also the husband is really petty.", "NTA. You are not obligated to change seats. Their lack of planning doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency on your part.", "NTA, everyone had the chance to choose their seat in advance.", "I saw a video where a flight attendant tried to get a guy to move seats cause the lady wanted to sit next to her husband and he kept saying no and that he payed for his seat and the attendant was being extremely rude", "NTA total manipulation to get the window seat. Nope. Nopity nope.", "I actually did wish them a good rest of the day in their language at the end of their flight.... the look on her face was priceless.", "I am sure he said it to save face and possibly also humiliate his wife. I think it was BS.", "Oh I think it was the hubby trying to save face explaining why he switched for his wife, because apparently,  which husband would let his wife have the better seat?", "Because (and I'm just guessing here), she doesn't. Her husband just said that because he's mad at her for making him switch seats.", "Sometimes the airlines do things that screw things up - like switch to a smaller plane or whatever. \n\nOP definitely didn\u2019t need to switch seats - just saying that saying everyone can pick a seat, and it isn\u2019t that straightforward", "My feeling is that there is nothing wrong with a flight attendant nicely requesting ONE TIME a switch for a better seat. But if the answer is no, than move along and definitely there is no right to make them feel bad. \nIn my case, it was the opposite.

Sometimes you pick a seat and the airline changes planes and you get assigned a new seat.

I hope she made it to the bathroom in time.", "This makes no sense.", "NTA \n\nOMG I am laughing so hard at the last bit \ud83e\udd23\n\nYou are never obligated to switch your seat, whether it was preselected at the time you booked or selected when you board (Ex Southwest Airlines has a first come, first serve seating policy based on boarding groups.) \n\nI will never understand people getting butt hurt over this!", "NTA. I will happily change seats to accommodate a family and child as I always appreciated when someone did that when I flew with my young child. Otherwise? Nope, you picked your seat, you sit there.", "Nta lmao, so they want the best seats and to not pay for it? No. Not a chance.", "I was on a long haul overnight flight recently, checked in too late and got stuck in a middle seat, got there to find two Korean friends either side who I immediately offered to swap with one so they can sit together.

What a deal!", "I put my headphones on as soon as I sit down.

It's really gaming the system. I almost never think someone is TA for refusing to switch seats on planes.", "Exactly. And everyone knows middle seats cost less. Also, why ask for a window if you need to poop? Makes no sense.", "That was the sweet revenge on the husband's side towards his wife. Jeee", "She didnt get up once lol", "Yep. Lol", "Really? This happened to me and I have never posted, but ok.", "NTA and those moments of saying farewell in the language of the rude ones who take you for a fool are always just delicious.", "Love it", "Im curious, what language was it. You dont have to answer if you dont feel comfortable.", "My first thought too, wth.", "Hah. My spouse and I often sit opposite each other or in front/behind each other because we both prefer aisles.
