How are you going to pay for your phone plan?", "I'm assuming you're a kid. What makes you think she's not gonna check any phone you buy?", "NTA but your mom is.  If you can find a way around the contract portion of getting a new phone, do it. You\u2019re under 18 and most companies won\u2019t sign you up without someone who can be responsible for the bill.  Until you turn 18, you might just be stuck.", "NTA. She's not going to stop if you get another phone. I mean, you bought your current phone. Sadly, she's prejudiced and wants to control your gayness to not operate during the night. See how ridiculous that sounds! Your brother can do what he likes, because he's straight (& might provide her with grandchildren) It's nonsense op. If you do get another phone, don't tell her and keep using the current one a decent amount so she doesn't go looking. You may be in more trouble for sneaking behind her back... \n\nSo, you wouldn't be in the wrong, not in my view, but your Mum will certainly see it as wrong, and that might be a battle that's best to wait till you have moved out.", "Wait until you are 18 and then buy your own phone. Since you are not on your phone that much, it doesn\u2019t matter.  Your mother allowing your  underage younger brother to watch porn is nuts.", "NTA. There's no reason to tell her about a phone she doesn't pay for either. If you mention to her that you got a different phone, it's almost like you're asking for her to have a problem with it. Just be safe with it.", "NTA\n\nI assume you are under 18.\n\nIf you can afford a new phone and contract go for it, just make sure you set it up with a PIN and fingerprint security.", "How old are you???\n\nYou payed for the phone you already have??\n\nWhy not just factory reset it every time she installs crap on it???\n\nNTA - but what are you going to do when she finds out about phone #2???", "Oh, dear. NTA, definitely. And I\u2019m sorry; you don\u2019t say so but it sounds like your family doesn\u2019t fully accept you for who you are. \n\nYou don\u2019t list your age, but I\u2019m guessing probably high school. This is difficult, right now, until you turn 18 and have the option of moving out/going to college. \n\nIf you have the funds, I\u2019d say you surely would not be TA for buying/controlling your own phone.  That being said, if your financial resources are limited, would you be better served by gritting your teeth, biding your time, and saving your resources to help you move out when the time comes?  I know that right now a year or two seems like a lifetime!  But patience now WILL pay off, if you\u2019re saving money to move out. \n\nDo you have a bank account under your own name?  Or some other way to keep your money accessible only to you?  And another responder mentioned the Trevor Project. That\u2019s a great resource, and there are others out there. \n\nGood luck to you.", "NTa but\u2026 You are 16 which means you\u2019re still technically a child and if you\u2019re ready to get a job to pay for your own phone, get ready to pay rent to your mother /or get emancipated and move out\u2026 \n\nMaybe you do use your phone too much. It probably has less to do with you being gay and more to do with you being sixteen and not an adult yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can bring up your brother\u2019s disrespect, but if she chooses to ignore that, you\u2019re gonna have to accept that. Or move out. It\u2019s unfair and ridiculous to do this just because you\u2019re gay and I\u2019m sorry this situation happening, but as long as you live with her, you\u2019re gonna have to bite your tongue. Buying another phone could be a loophole, but if she finds out she\u2019ll lose her shit. And it sounds like your brother would love to rat you out. I wouldn\u2019t risk it.
