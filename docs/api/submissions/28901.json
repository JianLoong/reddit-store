For two, there is three of them and no guarantee that they'll all embrace your daughter. I've heard countless tales of blended families where the odd step-sibling out is kept at a distance by all parties for the entirety of the marriages lifetime. Even if your daughters not bullied by them there is no guarantee they'll love her or even like her.\n\nSecondly, insistence on equalization is a bad precedent. After all, what happens when your daughter gets an afterschool job? Does she have to share her paycheck with her sisters even if they don't want to get a job themselves?\n\nForced equality in blended families is, in my opinion, the lazy parents way of avoiding arguments and inconvenient truths about how life isn't here to guarantee that you have exactly the same as everyone else.", "And this never came up before you got married?

Admittedly, it was almost E S H because I'm a big public school advocate, but it's entirely up to you where you send your kids to school and you shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nI think it's unreasonable for your husband to ask *your* BIL to pay an additional $120k/year for *his* three kids to go to private school. I know many families who send their kids to different schools, and it doesn't cause issues.\n\nFair doesn't always mean equal. If your husband wants his kids to go to school with your daughter, he's got a lot of money to cough up.", "His oldest daughter thinks it\u2019s a little unfair, the rest are too young to really understand.", ">You should have discussed this before marriage. \n\n\nHe never raised this issue before marriage.\n\n>you are saying your child deserves an advantage while your step kids don't. \n\n\nNo, she is saying she doesn't want to deprive her daughter of a good education that bil is generous to pay for. \n\n>As a parent, you should be providing equal opportunities for ALL your kids\n\nThe school is paid by BIL. Who is not in any way responsible for his sil's husband's kids. \n\n>You are also going to cause rifts with the kids\n\nGive me a break. Between a great education and stepsiblings, great education is the better choice. \n\n>Did you tell your husband that you wanted to play \"favourites\" when you accepted his hand knowing he has kids of his own? \n\nDid he told op that he wants her daughter to suffer because he can't send his kids to private school??", "He hid what an entitled asshole he was until they were married. Now he is ready to reveal his true asshole nature.", "YES THIS. He better start saving some money then!", "Is he going to expect BIL to pay for college for his girls too?", "He never talked about this before we got married. He said he\u2019s just starting to notice that his daughters (especially the 12yo) think it\u2019s unfair that their stepsister goes to a fancy private school and they don\u2019t. My sister also buys my daughter more expensive things sometimes and I think that adds to the issue.", "Yeah, I and my sister went to private school and my brother to a state school. That was his choice, but clearly not equal.", "We mostly pay for our own kids and he makes more than me. I do most of the childcare because he works more.", "Well said.", "Is the BIL the one that pays for the school. And he definitely doesn't have to pay for op's husband's kids.", "I wish they could go to the same school, but I can\u2019t ask my BIL to pay for three more kids and my husband and I can\u2019t afford it.", "How is OP going to provide this education to her step children, even if she wanted them to go to this private school?", "Is not op paying for the school, it's her bil. He isn't responsible to pay for his sil's husband's kids.", "He's trying to take advantage of your situation. It's like he waited for you to get married to bring it up.", "In some areas public schools are really bad.", "yes\n\npay for vacations, and expensive holiday gifts....", "Tell him that he can send them to private school on his dime. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t have to be punished because he thinks more of his kids.\n\nLife ain\u2019t fair Best to learn it now", "Then your husband has to step up as a father, and explain that other people in this life will get different set of hands dealt to them, even between family members, and you can't always get the same as your siblings/step-siblings get. Like your daughter doesn't have her father in her life, but your step kids have their father in their lives. The 12 year old is old enough to understand familial relations and why your sister and BIL are so involved in your daughter's life.", "I think you should address with your sister about the gifts, help the kids bond including with her and her children. Your families are still learning to be just and this might not help. \nMe and my brother went to different schools based off what my parents could afford and what were our interest and skills. There was never issues on that because my parents were very vocal about how we are different people so we don\u2019t need to do exactly the same thing.", "You mention everyone\u2019s age but your husband\u2019s. How much older than you is he?", "I agree.", "Surprised this never came up before you got married.\n\nAny scholarship opportunities? But yeah, no reason to hurt your daughter over this. It's not her fault, and it isn't yours either, even though I understand that must be weird for all of them.", "So you realistically think I can answer a question about someone's life that I never met and know absolutely nothing about their financial situation.\n\nMy point is when OP says I want my daughter to have the life I never had that should go towards her step children as well, because they are now her children. \n\nAlso thinking about it this reminds me of the common grandparents post that's here.  Seeing your ranking in sure you seen them. Where the grandparents spoil their bio child and ignore the stepchildren and everyone always say no you have to treat the kids the same. \n\nBut hey here's my idea. Maybe talk to the BIL and see if maybe he can help heck he pay for 2 and OP and her husband make it work and they pay for 2.  I see everyone saying he needs to find a way for his kids to go to private school. My suggestion they both should sit down and find out how they can make it work. They're a family it's not his kids and her kid", "I know! And that absolutely plays into parents' decisions when it comes to their kid's schooling, which I completely understand.", "Then op also needs to start realising she will be explaining why step dad never treats her and spends all his time and money on his own kids. \n\nI don't blame op but treating these kids differently within the same family builds resentment fast.", "^^^^^100%. This is what I would have written if I were smarter. NTA!", "He\u2019s 36.", "39m it's un the post", "OP said that her and her husband can't afford to send the kids to private school. OP couldn't send her own daughter to private school. And for her sister and BIL it is their niece in who's life they've been since she was born, and then OP's husband's kids they have no connection with. \n\nIt's completely different to say, that grandparents should buy equal kinds of gifts for birthdays etc than demand that relatives pay 80k yearly private school education, because their SIL got married to a man who has children from previous relationship/s.", "Yeah he's too grown to be asking this of a 25yo. It's not your job to figure something out for his kids when you're the one raising them and staying home in the first place.", "That\u2019s the BIL", "But if you look at my original comment it's not saying the BIL should pay. \n\nI'm saying OP reason is she wants her daughter to have the best education.  The thing is she has 4 daughters now and that's why I brought up if the kids said anything. Because I can see kids at that age being jealous of their sibling going to private school and their in public. \n\nShould she pull out her daughter no, should she ask her BIL also no but the conversation isn't over and she's going to need a better response then my daughter deserves the best when explaining to the other kids.  \n\nI didn't say OP an asshole because she's not but this is a situation with kids that's not just black and white where OP can say I'm not an asshole and move on.", "Oh I see. Still if his oldest is 13 he definitely closer to 30", "In your reply to me you wrote ***\"Maybe talk to the BIL and see if maybe he can help heck he pay for 2 and OP and her husband make it work and they pay for 2.\"***. That would be 80k in a year asking BIL to pay for OP's new husband's kids.\n\nOP replied in one comment, that in general they each pay for their own kids' stuff, so they haven't combined their finances regardless."]}
