For two, there is three of them and no guarantee that they'll all embrace your daughter. I've heard countless tales of blended families where the odd step-sibling out is kept at a distance by all parties for the entirety of the marriages lifetime.

After all, what happens when your daughter gets an afterschool job? Does she have to share her paycheck with her sisters even if they don't want to get a job themselves?\n\nForced equality in blended families is, in my opinion, the lazy parents way of avoiding arguments and inconvenient truths about how life isn't here to guarantee that you have exactly the same as everyone else.", "And this never came up before you got married?

ALL aspects of living together and blending your families should have been discussed in full, with mutual agreement, before you married. This is one of the most important ways that relationships with existing children involved differ from those of two people who don't already have kids. If this was such a big deal to him, why didn't he mention it before marrying you? Was he not thinking of his children? Or did he just assume you would pull your daughter out of private school? Honestly, either scenario doesn't speak well to his character or his quality as a dad or husband. In fact, it sounds like he *purposefully did not discuss this* before marriage, which kind of sounds like he wanted to \"trap\" you before bringing up this difficult money-related issue. It was a bait-and-switch: now that he has you, he can take the mask off and show you what he was hiding underneath because he thinks you won't leave.\n\nYour husband is being the text-book definition of a bad stepdad. Insisting that YOU take AWAY from YOUR KID, to make his kids \"more equal\". That's incredibly messed up, and it should tell you that he values neither you nor your daughter as a person that had a life before this marriage. All he cares about is how \"equal\" everyone is. That's not how happy families work. Even in non-blended families, kids should be treated *fairly*, not equally. \n\nPut your foot down. Call his bluff. He can't \"make\" you take your daughter out of private school. He certainly can't make your BIL pay for his kids.

You don't say I'd they have their mother in their life or nor, that, and other relatives, would be a perk for her too.\n\nLet her know it isn't a show of love, or favoritism.  It is something her aunt and uncle are doing for her,  and have been before you all met. Is it fair to force her to get used to a whole new family and a whole new school at the same time?\n\nI understand where your hubs is coming from. But there is a difference between keeping things fair within the family, and taking away an advantage. \n\nIf one of his kids got a scholarship and another was In school, he would not force the one to split their scholarship with the other.

It\u2019s outrageous that he thinks your brother in law would pay for  3 other strangers siblings \n\nit\u2019s none of your new  husbands business what school your daughter attends  or who pays for it. It\u2019s certainly not anything your BIL needs to have anything to do with. \n\nI really think you need to look after yourself as I\u2019m sure he\u2019s trying to control you in many other ways too. This is not what a loving marriage looks like. I\u2019m sorry.", "Your family has every right to those things for your daughter. That is the life she knows.\n\nThey have NO reason to do it for the dude you married kids. Where are their other family members??\n\nI said dude because the person you married is no man if he intends to insist another man provide for his kids because he is jealous. \n\nIf all this just started and was never mentioned prior to marriage it is a sign of abuse. Abusers love to wait until you can't get away easily!!!", "> My sister also buys my daughter more expensive things sometimes and I think that adds to the issue.\n\nThis is the only part that seems reasonable to be upset about. Those kids are young enough that this sort of thing will bother them. \n\nIt would probably be fair to suggest to your sister that they try to make gifts somewhat equal so the kids don\u2019t feel undervalued, at least for a few years until they\u2019re old enough to think rationally about why the gifts would be different. \n\nDifferent situation, but I remember being like 10 years old and getting a new jacket for my birthday \u2026 but my mom gave the exact same jacket to my brother at the same time. It felt like my birthday was an excuse to get us both something instead of my birthday being about me, and I never got anything new on his birthday. (My parents were good parents, but that one mistimed jacket still hurt the child version of me.)\n\nI doubt the kids even really care about the school. It\u2019s easy enough for them to understand that different doesn\u2019t mean better when it\u2019s something like what school they go to, and they likely have their own friends and stuff at their current school. But if their step-sister consistently gets much nicer gifts, they\u2019ll notice and feel that.", "Well it's unfair that his kids have a dad and yours doesn't. Life isn't fair.

But then, I could just be a pessimist. \n\nRegardless, this is not your problem. He should have had conversations long ago explaining to his girls that this is the way it is and why, before he joined your lives together. No animosity, just facts.

Ideally they would all be getting an excellent education, but in reality it has a literal cost above what is affordable to your family.\n\nYour daughter shouldn't give up opportunities she has because your step kids dont have access.

If you do consider sending her to public school, I would ask your BIL if he would be willing to put the tuition into a trust for her college and then explain to your daughter that uncle is still being generous but putting it towards her future higher education when money is really required. NTA", "If he really wants his children to attend the private school then there are options he can explore that don\u2019t involve demanding your sister and BIL shell out another $120k per year to send his children. He can look into scholarships, whether need based or private. He can look into loans. He can ask for help from his own family and friends. I understand that he just wants things to be equal among his children and your child, but he has no place demanding your family pays for his children. Your daughter is lucky to have an aunt and uncle who want to fund her education, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to pay for his kids now that you\u2019re married.\n\nWhat really gets me is the fact that he is demanding that you ask your sister and BIL to fund his kid\u2019s education. If this is something he genuinely cares about then he needs to be the one to ask. Say you agreed to ask and they say no? What would he do? Would he accept their answer and thank you for asking? Or would he take his frustration about being told \u201cno\u201d out on you and push you to keep asking in hopes they eventually agree? My guess is the second, he would potentially act like you somehow are at fault for their \u201cno\u201d response.\n\nIt\u2019s beyond entitled and he\u2019s putting you in a very uncomfortable position. If he keeps pushing the issue then I would tell him that he is the one who needs to make the request to your sister and BIL. If you do that I would also give your sister and BIL a heads up. Let them know that he has been pushing you to make the request and when he wouldn\u2019t accept your answer, you told him that it was his responsibility as their parent/as the person who is actually making the request. You can also let them know that you in no way feel it\u2019s their responsibility or feel entitled to their money, that you hadn\u2019t planned on even asking them, but that it has been causing issues and you felt it was best to encourage him to be direct. Let them know that you appreciate what they are doing for you and your daughter and do not share his feelings of entitlement. Yes, it would be putting them in an uncomfortable position, but he is not going to accept a \u201cno\u201d unless it comes directly from them and he is an adult who should be able to directly communicate. Instead he is trying to use you to manipulate them into giving the answer he wants, that\u2019s not okay.\n\nI really hope he isn\u2019t typically like this, that he\u2019s just having a lapse in judgment. He is putting you in a really unfair position and he\u2019s being very manipulative towards using. He\u2019s trying to use you like a pawn. I admire you for refusing to join him in his entitled attitude and for recognizing that your sister and BIL are doing something kind for you, not something that\u2019s owed to you. I also admire them for being kind to you and your daughter and helping her get a great education. I hope your husband realizes that he\u2019s being unfair and either drops it, or communicates his wants directly and accepts whatever answer he is given. If he chooses to communicate with them directly then I hope he doesn\u2019t try to tell them that you agree with him as a manipulation tactic, but be prepared for that, his current behavior makes it seem likely. That\u2019s why I think you should talk to your sister and BIL if you choose to tell your husband to communicate with them directly.\n\nAlso one more thing since it\u2019s bothering me as well\u2026 it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that he is telling you that you either need to put your child in public school or demand that your sister/BIL pay for his children to attend the private school. What if you asked and they said no, or if he directly asks and is told \u201cno\u201d? Would he still demand that you pull your daughter out of the private school and put her in public? I\u2019m guessing he would considering he had the audacity to say that in the first place. He\u2019s really bringing the saying \u201cmisery loves company\u201d to life by demanding that you sacrifice your own daughter\u2019s education and the opportunity she is being given to receive one from a private school if his kids aren\u2019t funded by your family too. It\u2019s wildly unfair of him to tell you to pull her out if his kids aren\u2019t funded by them. The fact that he\u2019s demanding rather than asking makes it so much worse. It\u2019s like he believes his word is law, like you have to fall in line.\n\nWhat would he do if they say \u201cno\u201d to him and you continue to send your daughter to the private school?", "You have to think, if your child had an involved father who was sending her to private school, your husband wouldn\u2019t dare ask this.

I got a good public school education, and not all school systems are the same, sooo......?\n\n\n\nAnd THAT being said, someone prior mentioned that your new husbands interest in your family member's funds for HIS daughters is pushing the envelope a bit and warrants discussion. \n\nGood luck", "Life isn\u2019t fair.", "So, the school thing is not an issue, I might ask your sister not to buy things just for her blood niece though.

But what do the children perceive it as when you're going the extra for your daughter and they're stuck in that public school system that you show such disdain for. Over time, it'll most likely grow to resentment. Even the smallest things that you and your family do extra for your daughter will likely be perceived as the same. It's hard blending two families. It's even harder when there is such an imbalance. All of these comments about your husband sitting them down and explaining that \"life isn't fair\" won't work on this situation. Though life isn't fair, your family should be. And no amount of explaining will take away from feeling like the outsider in your own family. \n\nAll of that being said, there's NAH.

Who wants step kids", "Also, OP, think long & hard about whether to reproduce with this piece of work! Between you, you already have FOUR children.", "So he works more, earns more, and keeps that money to himself/his kids, while you work less and earn less for yourself and your daughter, so you can also do most of the childcare - presumably for both your daughter and as well as kids? is this actually fair?", "Just be prepared, as your daughter, stays in private school, how your husband, that you brought into her life, and his children treat her, especially when you\u2019re not around.", "INFO:  I hope you are still financially independent and using birth control.

He's too much of a coward to do it himself, and instead, he expects you to potentially damage your relationship with your BIL and sister. He knows you want to keep your daughter in her school, so he's confident that you'll ask. He'll guilt you, pressure you, and make demands. \n\nSo ask him this: where does he get the absolute audacity to ask someone to spend 120k per year on his kids? In what universe does he think that is acceptable? Will his family be contributing an equal amount to your daughter? How about his in-laws?

He thinks that if your BIL won't spend 120k per year, your daughter should leave her school and her friends; your daughter should pay if your BIL won't. Anything your daughter gets that his kids don't will be held against you. \n\nHe thinks that because you're married, you will tolerate this.

If anything his costs are lower since it sounds like you\u2019re contributing to household expenses.

You should also be considering childcare in the division - would you be able to work more or advance further in your career if you weren\u2019t responsible for the majority of the childcare?\n\nAnd now he wants to take something important away from your kid? It\u2019s not just about the education or opportunities (though those are critical), it\u2019s that he wants to uproot your child, remove her from the environment she knows and is comfortable in, take her away from her friends and her cousins. He wants to do all of that instead of parent his own kids and explain to them that not everyone gets the same opportunities, even within families.\n\nI would absolutely be reevaluating my relationship after revelations like this. This was no small suggestion. And it already seems like an extremely inequitable relationship, significantly weighed in his favor. I haven\u2019t even gotten into how entitled and shady it is for him to think your BIL should pay for his kids to go to private school.\n\nPlease do NOT have more kids with this man unless he proves over and over again that he treats your daughter better and that this was totally out of character. It could really have lasting repercussions on your daughter, growing up with a father figure who takes advantage of her mom\u2019s kindness and who so easily forces her to sacrifice her well-being to benefit her stepsiblings.", "OP, you may want to go stay with your sister and BIL or some good friends.\n\nI don't think this relationship is any good...\n\nYou are going to be financially dependent on this guy if you don't get out soon and work more.", "If it's so important to him.... he could see if that school is hiring.

You're honoring your agreements and the way he wants things done.

It isn't hard to budget the same amount per child.", "This here. My parents had a set amount of money they would spend on me and my brother. Sometimes the imbalance was there for quantity. For example, him getting a PlayStation, a game or two, and some clothes, where I would get multiple Barbies and accessories, clothes, and a couple other small toys. But it would always be around the same amount of money spent.", "Right? The gifts might not look equal but pricing is easy.

I got art supplies (far less expensive in total) and was THRILLED. I didn't want a snowboard and I didn't need a budget of hundreds to make me super happy. It wasn't unbalanced in their favor every year or anything, my point is just that kids have unique needs.", "I think the implication isn't quite what you're interpreting. Like, for instance, I was a huge bookworm growing up, my sister liked toys, especially if they'd just come out. For every one of her toys, I could get like three books. So the money spent would be the same, but I technically got \"more\" than she did, because I'd get several books while she only got one or two big items. The point is that equal doesn't mean fair.

Some of the wife's family members were very aggressive about pushing to \"share\" that largesse with the other three kids, but the parents were adamant that the money was Brian's.  And they never put any pressure on Brian, who was able to cover his college tuition and buy his first home for cash.

And a quality education is everything, public schools are a shit show with how little they are paid, an education from a private school will make a HUGE difference in her daughter's life forever, this isn't the same as say, going to an expensive summer camp or having her BIL buy the super fancy toy at the zoo while the others get smaller things.\n\nIf op had the funds and was only sending her own kid to school, I'd call BS on her. But op isn't paying for the school her BIL is it's ridiculous to go up to him and say these 3 kids you just met are technically your nieces and nephews clearly you should feel and treat them like my daughter who you have known since birth. And it's not fair to deprive her daughter of a once in lifetime opportunity that could make all the difference in her life just so that her step kids don't feel bad. There is always going to be someone who gets something you don't and you have to learn how to deal with that, and yeah sometimes it's your own siblings.

It will never be even, because they don't have 100% the same family. They have half a family they share and half a family they don't.   \nKids are fully capable of understanding that, just as they understand their rich friend at school gets to go to Disney World 3x a year and they don;t.", "Yes.

Like my parents have a 15 year age gap, granted she was in her late 30s with 3 kids at that point but still a large age gap nonetheless, and their relationship is one of the strongest i have ever seen.

The reality is, if OP is saving her husband on after school care etc, he\u2019s coming away from the deal with a lot more than he\u2019s saying. \n\nI find it absolutely ludicrous that he\u2019s expecting someone else to pay his children\u2019s schooling.

That was wrong. But your suggestion for how to handle it, to just ignore the situation and say life is unfair, that isn't any better. \n\nHis kids are 6, 8, and 11, and op's kid is 8. They aren't biologically related, but they are now being raised in the same house by the same set of parents. If op and her husband wants to raise a healthy set of kids who won't grow up hating eachother and their respective step parents, they need to make it a priority to treat the kids all equally as much as possible. That's what they signed up for when they married each other. \n\nFor example, op said her sister buys her bio kid more expensive gifts than the step kids, that is completely unnecessary and op should put a stop to it. \n\nThe one thing op can't change is the schooling, and she/her husband should sit down with the 12 year old and talk to them about it. Acknowledge that they feel it's unfair and it's ok to feel that way, but also explain how op's kid doesn't have her bio dad in her life, and how much more unfair that is for her. That is a much healthier way of handling it imo.", "I agree with you, but that may not do anything to stop the resentment that likely will develop.

You have articulated perfectly.", "I think OP's husband is an ass for trying to suggest some dude who is entirely unrelated to him should gift 100ks to his kids, but he may have been entirely unaware of what his gf's schooling situation was, it may never have come up in conversation.\n\nIt is of course possible that it did, and he assumed he'd be marrying into the money shower. He doesn't sound too bright.\n\nNTA but this sounds like it will cause resentment because of OP's husband thinking he should be getting some of that free money.

OP was 17 and said things would have been impossible without them, and no mention of OPs parents. I think it\u2019s safe to assume BIL/sister are super invested in their niece. BIL/sister aren\u2019t as close to the step kids as they are with their niece. The relationship can grow stronger eventually if they all spend time. It all depends.

It would be equally inappropriate if the man was 25 and the woman 36. That\u2019s too large an age gap when the youngest person in the relationship is under 26. The brain doesn\u2019t fully develop until 26. The larger the age difference between someone under 26 and an older partner, the more likely the older partner is not a healthy partner. Are there exceptions? Yes, of course. But since the first thing this guy did upon marrying this woman was to demand she either pull her kid from private school or get her BIL to fork over 120,000/year to send his 3 kids to private school, I\u2019m going out on a limb and saying this man is not relationship material and he went hunting for a younger woman he thought he could manipulate. I mean, he has already started. They each pay for their own kids, yet she is primary caregiver to his kids and he just pockets that savings for himself. He has a lot of cheek.", "We don\u2019t know if the step children have a mother in their life.

OP should talk to BIL about it.  The school part is a bit more nuanced as it is something that was happening before the marriage and the kid has school friends, routine and expectations already created.  If you take that away she will resent everybody in the family. If you don't the other kids and stepdad will resent her... it is a no win situation.", "Tough.\n\nSometimes, resentment is just a fact of life.
