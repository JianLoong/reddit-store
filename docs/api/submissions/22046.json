{"id": 22046, "submission_id": "14xt71l", "title": "AITA for making my brother\u2019s baby mama pay her own bills?", "selftext": "So the past few years have been extremely difficult. In April 2021 my mom was diagnosed with ALS. In Sept that same year, my younger brother(28yo) died of an accidental fentanyl overdose. Then in 2022 my remaining sister(41yo) nearly died from alcoholism and my dad nearly died of congestive heart failure(at the time as my sister). Finally, in May 2023, my mom died of ALS. \n\nAll the while, my younger brother\u2019s baby mama(30 yo) has had my mom paying for her new car, her car insurance, her son\u2019s(8yo) clothes and toys, her phone, and her phone bill. This all adds up to nearly a thousand dollars a month. My mom was doing this so that she could still have access and see my nephew(dead brother\u2019s son).\n\nBaby mama doesn\u2019t work. Says she has chronic back pain- has been to multiple doctors, all of whom refuse to write her any more pain medication or disability paperwork. She\u2019s in and out of rehab for opioid abuse. The week before my brother passed, she overdosed, herself. Her mom is a Nurse PhD and step dad works as well.\n\nI know her parents have a lot of money because they\u2019ve said so and yet, it\u2019s now two months after my mom died and I\u2019ve asked her to move to her own phone bill, insurance, and to either pay off the car(all my brother\u2019s life insurance went to her) or I can sell it. Her mom told her they don\u2019t want to assume the payments on the remaining $17k because they don\u2019t want to pay interest- apparently they were fine with my mom paying interest. She sends me *some* money to pay the bills, but it\u2019s not all of it, and I\u2019m already knee deep in my mom\u2019s paperwork and bills because I\u2019m the executor. \n\nI feel miserable because I love my nephew and want to be in his life but I genuinely cannot afford to be this girl\u2019s parent/secretary for her. She keeps just saying it\u2019s been so hard for her with MY mom dying. I live six hours away from her so it\u2019s not like I can easily just fix this either. \n\nI\u2019ve given her two months to make the switch. She hasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t responding. AITA for cutting her off monetarily?\n\nEDIT: My nephew is safe with her as she is living, for the foreseeable future, with her parents who are well-educated and attentive people. Calling CPS in this situation will isolate me from him, barring me from even being able to see if any abuse occurs in the future.

Sure its been hard for her to lose her money train.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry for all your losses.", "NTA.  You've been more than generous with your timeline.  Her parents need to step up if they have money.  I mean are ya fucking kidding me?  They've had money all this time & your mom was the one paying for everything?  Her parents are selfish AH's. I'm so sorry about your mom. My mom passed from ALS as well.  What a scary, horrible disease.", "NTA at all, I\u2019m sorry for the rough times you\u2019ve been going through", "Very clearly NTA.  Don't let her play you like she did your mom. \n\nShe could pay off the car with the life insurance anyway.", "You are not the asshole in any way. She needs to grow up and figure things out. NTA.", "NTA - your mom was very generous for what she did.  Unfortunately, your mom did it for herself to keep access to nephew(grandchild).  Your mom is gone now (my condolences, OP) and baby mama is an adult.  There is no need nor any reason why YOU should have to foot the bill.  Again, she's an adult.", "NTA. You definitely need to cut her off. And there is no reason for you to feel guilty about it at all - people like her use that guilt to keep taking advantage.", "My condolences for your loss. Losing a family member really sucks. You\u2019re absolutely NTA here. She\u2019s a grown ass woman. She can pay for her own expenses, sadly either with your brothers life insurance or her own families money.", "Also call cps", "Yeah, she guilted me when I was telling her about the car note. She said, \"Well I have a secret/separate account with the life insurance money from your brother that was for me and \"son's name\" for a rainy day or if we needed to move out, but I guess I can use that.\"", "Yeah, luckily there are others taking care of him. She's not a *bad* mom.

There's already a trust I manage for him.", "I'd wager drugs", "So, a fun complicating factor in this is that my sister's boys are also in a violent and abusive home. Her ex, who beat her to near d*ath, has k*lled animals in front of them(pets), thrown them across the room, punched them, etc. I called CPS, they visited the trailer and applauded my sister and her ex husband for how good of coparents they were and how good the boys are. \n\nI have less than zero amount of faith in CPS.", "That's the other piece of this. When my brother died, my mom and I set up a trust for him with myself as the Trustee. There are inheritors or back up trustees, but it would be hard to remove me. The mom isn't on there.

The mom was very upset that she wasn't the trustee.", "Having to live off relatives is a \"rainy day\"!", "I have to disagree, a negligent mother is a bad mother.

Stop paying now for this drug addict or pay forever.", "NTA Should have cur hervoff from the Starr. Sounds like she was blackmailing OP's mom so she could see her grandson. OP should notvruin her life cover this. If she continues to use drugs she will lose her son.", "NTA and you gave her 2 months longer than I would have.", "NTA, she was practicing elder abuse.  In most states demanding bills to be paid to allow contact with a grandchild is a crime, extortion of an elderly person.", "Here\u2019s the thing \n\nAt some point she will want more. And she will continue to use nephew to extort that \n\nSo you\u2019re in the same place either way. \n\nCut her off. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso consider- at some point she\u2019s gonna want to exploit you for childcare.

NTA. Grab some scissors and cut her out ASAP.", "Good let her move!!!!!", "Hate when people do that sort of thing. When we bought our house we had to negotiate some money off because the whole place needed rewiring, and the elderly couple we bought from said \"oh well it'll have to come from the money we set aside for our funerals\"\n\nI was like, OK fine.

I've called CPS in the past for this but because they live with the grandmother and grandfather there is nothing I can do. I feel fucked all around? How am I supposed to get them out? I've spoked with two separate lawyers in Child Family law. Also, now that I've called CPS for my other nephews, I'm barred from speaking to them until they're 18 so, guess I don't know if they're getting beat daily now!

So you are very much not the next of kin.", "How is that the living grandparents are not next of kin?", "Yes, I\u2019m aware.", "You're right CPS will likely do nothing. Things with your nephews are beyond your control and your NTA for cutting her off. \nIt sounds like there is a lot of addiction and dysfunction in the family. May I suggest that you focus on taking care of yourself now instead of others. It's not easy dealing with all the losses as well as unstable people on top of it. I feel for you and wish you the best", "NTA. She can apply for social security for the child\u2019s father being dead and for social security disability if she\u2019s that hurt. (I\u2019m doubting she\u2019s that hurt)", "YWNBTA. \n\nYour nephew's mother is a manipulative addict. You cannot afford to maintain her lifestyle, and the fact is that paying her bills is not an option for you. \n\nWho actually owns the car? Is it in your mother's name, or the child's mother? If your mother's estate is on the hook, then you have obligations to the bank. If the child's mother is the legal owner of the car, then simply let her know that there's no money anymore. It's gone. Your mother passed, there's no income, everything is tied up in the estate right now, and your personal assets are minimal. She'll have to find a job. \n\nShe's not in need. Her and your nephew's needs are being met, and she has the option of working. Honestly, it sounds like she's being enabled and removing that might be good for her. \n\nAnd I would be careful about assuming you would receive custody of the child if something happened. That's usually decided by a court. Parents can nominate a guardian in their will, but a court still makes the ultimate determination. The child has living grandparents who are already supporting him and with whom he lived. If they wanted custody, it would likely be granted.", "Presumably she also has an addictions issue? Sadly, money disappears fast in that circumstance. \n\nIdeally, she spent it all on rehab and is no longer using, but either way, I would consider that money gone.", "No she doesn't. If she's been in and out of rehab, very likely the bulk of whatever she inherited is gone. If she's not working, she doesn't need a car. Her parents have vehicles they can loan her, the car can be sold and she can acquire a reliable used one for significantly less than the outstanding debt on the one she has now, or she can use uber.", "Ummm... I think you misread their response", "I\u2019m clearly using that phrase wrong, so apologies. It\u2019s written in the advance directive plans we set up after my brother died that he would come to me. The grandparents are also caring for an adult disabled child and are much older. So as long as we remain on good terms, if anything happens, my nephew comes to me in terms of guardianship."]}
