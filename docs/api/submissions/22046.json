{"id": 22046, "submission_id": "14xt71l", "title": "AITA for making my brother\u2019s baby mama pay her own bills?", "selftext": "So the past few years have been extremely difficult. In April 2021 my mom was diagnosed with ALS. In Sept that same year, my younger brother(28yo) died of an accidental fentanyl overdose. Then in 2022 my remaining sister(41yo) nearly died from alcoholism and my dad nearly died of congestive heart failure(at the time as my sister). Finally, in May 2023, my mom died of ALS. \n\nAll the while, my younger brother\u2019s baby mama(30 yo) has had my mom paying for her new car, her car insurance, her son\u2019s(8yo) clothes and toys, her phone, and her phone bill. This all adds up to nearly a thousand dollars a month. My mom was doing this so that she could still have access and see my nephew(dead brother\u2019s son).\n\nBaby mama doesn\u2019t work. Says she has chronic back pain- has been to multiple doctors, all of whom refuse to write her any more pain medication or disability paperwork. She\u2019s in and out of rehab for opioid abuse. The week before my brother passed, she overdosed, herself. Her mom is a Nurse PhD and step dad works as well.\n\nI know her parents have a lot of money because they\u2019ve said so and yet, it\u2019s now two months after my mom died and I\u2019ve asked her to move to her own phone bill, insurance, and to either pay off the car(all my brother\u2019s life insurance went to her) or I can sell it. Her mom told her they don\u2019t want to assume the payments on the remaining $17k because they don\u2019t want to pay interest- apparently they were fine with my mom paying interest. She sends me *some* money to pay the bills, but it\u2019s not all of it, and I\u2019m already knee deep in my mom\u2019s paperwork and bills because I\u2019m the executor. \n\nI feel miserable because I love my nephew and want to be in his life but I genuinely cannot afford to be this girl\u2019s parent/secretary for her. She keeps just saying it\u2019s been so hard for her with MY mom dying. I live six hours away from her so it\u2019s not like I can easily just fix this either. \n\nI\u2019ve given her two months to make the switch. She hasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t responding. AITA for cutting her off monetarily?\n\nEDIT: My nephew is safe with her as she is living, for the foreseeable future, with her parents who are well-educated and attentive people. Calling CPS in this situation will isolate me from him, barring me from even being able to see if any abuse occurs in the future.

Sure its been hard for her to lose her money train.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry for all your losses.", "NTA.  You've been more than generous with your timeline.  Her parents need to step up if they have money.  I mean are ya fucking kidding me?  They've had money all this time & your mom was the one paying for everything?  Her parents are selfish AH's. I'm so sorry about your mom. My mom passed from ALS as well.  What a scary, horrible disease.", "NTA at all, I\u2019m sorry for the rough times you\u2019ve been going through", "Very clearly NTA.  Don't let her play you like she did your mom. \n\nShe could pay off the car with the life insurance anyway.", "You are not the asshole in any way. She needs to grow up and figure things out. NTA.", "NTA - your mom was very generous for what she did.  Unfortunately, your mom did it for herself to keep access to nephew(grandchild).  Your mom is gone now (my condolences, OP) and baby mama is an adult.  There is no need nor any reason why YOU should have to foot the bill.  Again, she's an adult.", "NTA. You definitely need to cut her off. And there is no reason for you to feel guilty about it at all - people like her use that guilt to keep taking advantage.", "My condolences for your loss. Losing a family member really sucks. You\u2019re absolutely NTA here. She\u2019s a grown ass woman. She can pay for her own expenses, sadly either with your brothers life insurance or her own families money.", "Also call cps", "Yeah, she guilted me when I was telling her about the car note. She said, \"Well I have a secret/separate account with the life insurance money from your brother that was for me and \"son's name\" for a rainy day or if we needed to move out, but I guess I can use that.\"", "Yeah, luckily there are others taking care of him. She's not a *bad* mom. She's just not... mentally as present as needed.", "She put a portion into an account for \"a rainy day or if she needs to move out of her parents' house\" or for \"son's name\". There's already a trust I manage for him.", "I'd wager drugs", "So, a fun complicating factor in this is that my sister's boys are also in a violent and abusive home. Her ex, who beat her to near d*ath, has k*lled animals in front of them(pets), thrown them across the room, punched them, etc. I called CPS, they visited the trailer and applauded my sister and her ex husband for how good of coparents they were and how good the boys are. \n\nI have less than zero amount of faith in CPS.", "That's the other piece of this. When my brother died, my mom and I set up a trust for him with myself as the Trustee. There are inheritors or back up trustees, but it would be hard to remove me. The mom isn't on there. So he's protected monetarily, and its not set to be accessible to him until he's 25. The mom was very upset that she wasn't the trustee.", "Having to live off relatives is a \"rainy day\"!", "I have to disagree, a negligent mother is a bad mother. She doesn't become a decent mom just because there are other people working hard to make up for her shortcomings.

You're way nicer than I'd be in this situation. She's a grown ass women who needs to take care of her own stuff. Forget the 2 months cut her off now! Her parents will pick her bills up, regardless of what they said.\n\nI'm sorry for you losses, do yourself a favor and kick her to the curb so you can start moving forward.", "Why wait 2 months? Stop paying now for this drug addict or pay forever.", "NTA Should have cur hervoff from the Starr. Sounds like she was blackmailing OP's mom so she could see her grandson. OP should notvruin her life cover this. If she continues to use drugs she will lose her son.", "NTA and you gave her 2 months longer than I would have.", "NTA, she was practicing elder abuse.  In most states demanding bills to be paid to allow contact with a grandchild is a crime, extortion of an elderly person.", "Here\u2019s the thing \n\nAt some point she will want more. And she will continue to use nephew to extort that \n\nSo you\u2019re in the same place either way. \n\nCut her off. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso consider- at some point she\u2019s gonna want to exploit you for childcare. You\u2019ll see your nephew.", "Stop paying her bills - she\u2019s an adult, plus you have your own bills to take care of\u2026 your NTA", "NTA\n\nYour mother was being used, as are you now.

NTA. Grab some scissors and cut her out ASAP.", "Good let her move!!!!!", "Hate when people do that sort of thing. When we bought our house we had to negotiate some money off because the whole place needed rewiring, and the elderly couple we bought from said \"oh well it'll have to come from the money we set aside for our funerals\"\n\nI was like, OK fine. I don't care where the money comes from.", "And your answer is to just stop giving her money and do, what seems to be, absolutely nothing to get them out of that house...\n\nPoor nephews to have no one around them that actually cares about their wellbeing. \n\nJudgement changed.", "Do you understand the workings of getting anything done within the legal system as far as that? I've called CPS in the past for this but because they live with the grandmother and grandfather there is nothing I can do. I feel fucked all around? How am I supposed to get them out? I've spoked with two separate lawyers in Child Family law. Also, now that I've called CPS for my other nephews, I'm barred from speaking to them until they're 18 so, guess I don't know if they're getting beat daily now! The one good person in their life is gone. \n\nApologies if I refuse to kidnap my nephew.", "Cut her off. She\u2019s using you", "NTA\n\nStop paying any bills that aren't in your Mom's name.  The estate should NOT be paying any expenses except those that your Mom was legally responsible for.  Cancel the phone line.  Is your Mom's name attached to the car (loan or title)?  If not, stop paying those too.", "Nta", "NTA sorry for all your losses. Simply put though she married your brother not you. If nephew is good that's as far as familial ties go imo. Cut her off.", "NTA!  Cut her off.   Sorry to say, but regardless if you keep paying or not , she is going to do what she can to keep the boy from your side of the family.
