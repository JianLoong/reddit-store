In April 2021 my mom was diagnosed with ALS. In Sept that same year, my younger brother(28yo) died of an accidental fentanyl overdose. Then in 2022 my remaining sister(41yo) nearly died from alcoholism and my dad nearly died of congestive heart failure(at the time as my sister). Finally, in May 2023, my mom died of ALS. \n\nAll the while, my younger brother\u2019s baby mama(30 yo) has had my mom paying for her new car, her car insurance, her son\u2019s(8yo) clothes and toys, her phone, and her phone bill. This all adds up to nearly a thousand dollars a month. My mom was doing this so that she could still have access and see my nephew(dead brother\u2019s son).\n\nBaby mama doesn\u2019t work. Says she has chronic back pain- has been to multiple doctors, all of whom refuse to write her any more pain medication or disability paperwork. She\u2019s in and out of rehab for opioid abuse. The week before my brother passed, she overdosed, herself. Her mom is a Nurse PhD and step dad works as well.\n\nI know her parents have a lot of money because they\u2019ve said so and yet, it\u2019s now two months after my mom died and I\u2019ve asked her to move to her own phone bill, insurance, and to either pay off the car(all my brother\u2019s life insurance went to her) or I can sell it. Her mom told her they don\u2019t want to assume the payments on the remaining $17k because they don\u2019t want to pay interest- apparently they were fine with my mom paying interest. She sends me *some* money to pay the bills, but it\u2019s not all of it, and I\u2019m already knee deep in my mom\u2019s paperwork and bills because I\u2019m the executor. \n\nI feel miserable because I love my nephew and want to be in his life but I genuinely cannot afford to be this girl\u2019s parent/secretary for her. She keeps just saying it\u2019s been so hard for her with MY mom dying.

Sure its been hard for her to lose her money train.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry for all your losses.", "NTA.  You've been more than generous with your timeline.  Her parents need to step up if they have money.  I mean are ya fucking kidding me?  They've had money all this time & your mom was the one paying for everything?  Her parents are selfish AH's. I'm so sorry about your mom. My mom passed from ALS as well.  What a scary, horrible disease.", "NTA at all, I\u2019m sorry for the rough times you\u2019ve been going through", "Very clearly NTA.  Don't let her play you like she did your mom. \n\nShe could pay off the car with the life insurance anyway.", "You are not the asshole in any way. She needs to grow up and figure things out. NTA.", "NTA - your mom was very generous for what she did.  Unfortunately, your mom did it for herself to keep access to nephew(grandchild).  Your mom is gone now (my condolences, OP) and baby mama is an adult.  There is no need nor any reason why YOU should have to foot the bill.  Again, she's an adult.", "NTA. You definitely need to cut her off. And there is no reason for you to feel guilty about it at all - people like her use that guilt to keep taking advantage.", "My condolences for your loss. Losing a family member really sucks. You\u2019re absolutely NTA here. She\u2019s a grown ass woman. She can pay for her own expenses, sadly either with your brothers life insurance or her own families money.", "Also call cps", "Yeah, she guilted me when I was telling her about the car note. She said, \"Well I have a secret/separate account with the life insurance money from your brother that was for me and \"son's name\" for a rainy day or if we needed to move out, but I guess I can use that.\"", "Yeah, luckily there are others taking care of him. She's not a *bad* mom. She's just not... mentally as present as needed.", "She put a portion into an account for \"a rainy day or if she needs to move out of her parents' house\" or for \"son's name\". There's already a trust I manage for him.", "I'd wager drugs", "So, a fun complicating factor in this is that my sister's boys are also in a violent and abusive home. Her ex, who beat her to near d*ath, has k*lled animals in front of them(pets), thrown them across the room, punched them, etc. I called CPS, they visited the trailer and applauded my sister and her ex husband for how good of coparents they were and how good the boys are. \n\nI have less than zero amount of faith in CPS.", "That's the other piece of this. When my brother died, my mom and I set up a trust for him with myself as the Trustee. There are inheritors or back up trustees, but it would be hard to remove me. The mom isn't on there. So he's protected monetarily, and its not set to be accessible to him until he's 25. The mom was very upset that she wasn't the trustee.", "Having to live off relatives is a \"rainy day\"!", "I have to disagree, a negligent mother is a bad mother. She doesn't become a decent mom just because there are other people working hard to make up for her shortcomings. You are not only a bad mother if you harm your child directly", "\u2026"]}
