Really hard when they don\u2019t get back to you or change their mind last minute. I tried distancing myself from them and this was refreshing, but at the same time I know it also hurt both of us to some degree because we were pretty dependent on each other(also about a 6 year friendship).

Using mental illness as an excuse to be a shitty person is a HUGE irritation of mine. You have a selfish entitled friend who also happens to have depression.

If she doesn\u2019t contact you or plan anything herself, then you guys aren\u2019t really friends then. She\u2019s just using you when convenient.

Depression isn't an excuse to treat your friends like shit. She's walking on you because she knows you'll take it if she uses her mental illness as an excuse, and that's not fair to you. \n\nPeople do need to step away from time to time and that's okay. What's not okay is wasting another person's time to do it.", "Your friend sounds like a narcissist.  Using basic manners and courtesy is not a threat to someone's mental health, nor does someone's mental health impede the ability to write a 1 sentence text along the lines of \"not feeling well, cannot make it today\".  \n\nTo me it sounds like she uses her mental health as an excuse.  \n\nNTA.  And frankly, you may wish to reconsider this friendship.", "NTA  Like others in the replies, I've lived with crippling depression and other mental disorders my entire life, but if I have to take a raincheck on things, I let people know.  Being ghosted can be hurtful and frustrating in and of itself - it's something that would leave me feeling ignored and horrible, and like I didn't matter.  I'd never want to do it to my friends. \n\nYour friend might be going through a genuinely hard time right now, but that doesn't mean she gets to treat you poorly, first by ghosting you, and then by sending such a nasty non-apology when you politely and reasonably asked for a heads up in future.  I'm quite sure she'd be very upset if you had ghosted her.  Mental illness is painful, but treating your friends poorly - especially the ones making a real effort to be there for you - is how you wind up with no friends.", "Had a friend like this.

If so, that's the real problem here. Also, did she ask you to come over to help her out or did you do that completely of your own accord? I'm not criticizing you for doing that, but you might not know what you're really getting into here.\n\nI'm going with a massive assumption by continuing to explain here, but SAD causes a person to do a lot more than just withdraw from social situations. It also causes them to ghost friends, not keep up with their share of phone calling, avoid phone calls and texts and VMs, etc.\n\nIf she has SAD or something similar, it's beyond important that she see a therapist and probably a psychiatrist. Untreated SAD can devolve into agoraphobia or \"crazy cat lady\" lifestyle. And if you aren't seeing a therapist yourself, get one ASAP and ask them about how to cope with what's going on with your friend. Take care of yourself first, then try to take care of her.\n\nNAH, if (and that's a big \"if\") I'm right about the SAD.", "Thank you for your perspective. \n\nI am also that friend that needs to \u201cdisappear\u201d at times. Days, weeks, even a month. I really understand needing to be alone, more than most people do.

I usually send out a, \u201cI have to go hermit\u201d message, and my friends know what that means by now. I can also be flakey, but always communicate if I won\u2019t be where I said I would be. \n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s tough on both sides.

My small friend group, including the mentioned friend, all share our location together. This friend does make time to go to festivals, house shows/parties, festivals, etc. on the days she ghosts me, and was out today (when we had plans) shopping for hours. \n\nSo again, I try not to judge, but considering this can definitely feel like it\u2019s more personal than she says.", "I don\u2019t disagree with you, thank you.", "While I\u2019m doing much better now - I\u2019ve spent the last decade in therapy, time in psychiatric hospitals and have more than one suicide attempt.

I didn\u2019t feel like all of that was necessary to include in my OP, as I don\u2019t need to prove my own experience with mental health related issues. \n\nI struggle *greatly* with my own mental health, since I was in elementary school, and have spent more than my fair share of time isolating. I do not, at all, blame her for needing time alone. \n\nI never said she\u2019s consciously ghosting me, and I\u2019ve repeatedly emphasized that I don\u2019t want her to *force* herself to do anything.

ADHD is one of the most misdiagnosed and self-diagnoses disorders there is. She really, really needs to be seeing a psychiatrist.\n\nOn a side note, a lot of professionals believe that ADHD and type 2 bipolar disorder are actually the same thing. If you look at the list of symptoms, they're virtually identical. I know this because I'm bipolar and I've had this discussion with almost every psychiatrist and therapist I've had.

I asked her to let me know if she can\u2019t make it when we have plans. \n\nHow is that \u201cforcing\u201d her to communicate?", "No. Full stop. Mental health does NOT mean zero accountability. If someone tries to force me to communicate when I don\u2019t want to, it actually feels like you are forcing me at gunpoint to pull my own teeth out.

While your friend is technically correct that she can indeed ignore everyone if that is what she needs to do for her mental health, she may need to follow this to its conclusion of being alone. No friendship should be so one sided, and if this friend \"needs\" to be selfish for her own health, then you would probably be best just leaving her alone and out of your plans. Your mental health is just as important and constant ghosting and disrupted plans will not be good for you either.", "NTA. But stop making plans with her. See if she asks you to go somewhere or if she waits for you to make the plans.  Honestly, I would also slowly take a step back from this friendship.\n\nIf she goes to other places, it means she likely doesn't see you as a priority. If you ever make plans with her and she ghosts you, go out anyway! Maybe invite a third person as backup plan.", "Why are you surprised when your depressed, maybe anxious, friend act like it ? If you plan things with a depressed person expecting them to react like they aren't sick, are you that understanding ?\nAlso, if you want to improve communication, doing so when she is down isn't the best time, I would advice to have this conversation when she feels better.", "Reading these posts will have you questioning how our society isn\u2019t completely fallen apart, oh wait", "NTA!\n\nHonestly, this isn\u2019t a friend. Sure, you\u2019re not expecting reciprocation but this girl has zero respect for you as an individual. She expects you to be there at her beck and call, flakes on you when you\u2019ve made plans, and dismisses your feelings when you call her out. What exactly do you get out of the friendship with her?\n\nWhen someone screw up, you don\u2019t ask them to not repeat the behavior or action that harmed you. You explain how it affected you and then *request* it not happen again to set up healthy boundaries for yourself. \n\nYou deserve better than this OP. It may be time to end this bond between you both.", "NTA. Maybe leave her alone for a bit.", "NTA", "NTA. She is an emotional vampire and isn\u2019t really your friend.", "NTA\n\n> she will \u201cignore everyone if that\u2019s what she needs to do\u201d.\n\nThis is entirely unacceptable. She's got a friend that's reaching out and trying to be a source of human contact for her, and she's completely taking it for granted.\n\nI've been doing the depression gig for around 10 years and I have a very good friend who calls me, sends me memes, etc. etc. - I mostly don't respond, but man do I appreciate him. And the idea of straight up ghosting him while standing up our plans? Mind-bogglingly ungrateful and disrespectful.\n\nDepression is very hard, and it is easy to become selfishly lonely.\n\nI don't know if this advice is any good because I don't know the two of you - but I would hold off from her for a while. Don't be the plans-maker. Maybe she will be reminded of how nice it was to have someone like you around, and she might learn some thankfulness.", "Stop making plans with her. You tried, she doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate it.", "Nta. Don't hang out with her again until she learns to grow up. Being depressed is no excuse for disregarding your feelings", "Yes, it\u2019s an unfortunate fact that a LOT of people out here are dealing with depression. This saying is a little cliche but still true: it\u2019s not our fault, but it is our responsibility. Like you say, nobody is entitled to supportive friendships, that\u2019s something you have to nurture and maintain by reciprocating. I know being in a bout of depression can make me a little self-centered, but that\u2019s not an excuse to treat friends badly. \n\nOp, you sound like a great friend, and you deserve friends who also show care towards you in return.", "NTA, but don't set yourself on fire to warm your friend.\n\nPlease.", "Your crippling depression isn\u2019t others crippling depression. It\u2019s w3ird to try and compare.", "Whoa, hang on. She ghosted you and went SHOPPING? That changes everything.  Look, it would be one thing if she was self-care cocooning and slept all day, but she was out and about and actively chose not to even send you a text to let you know she'd changed her mind about your hang-out? That's not depression, that's just bad manners. If she had enough spoons to go out in public, then she had enough spoons to send you one short text message so that you could get on with your day and do other thing. \n\nBabe. You sound like an amazing friend, but she's treating you with absolute disrespect, like your time has no value at all. You deserve better than this! There's a fine line between being patient and being a doormat, and you need to stop letting her wipe her feet on you.  It breaks my heart that you're so sweet and she just... doesn't appreciate it at all. You deserve better.", "NTA. I had a friendship like this for a long time. My BFF lived internationally but jumped around a lot. Every time she'd come home we'd eventually get together and it was like old times. And every time I foolishly thought that she wouldn't totally ghost me when she left this time because she seemed like she was in a good place. But she would and when she'd eventually get in contact, it was always because she was too depressed to reach out or respond to any messages. I lived with it, but one day my millennial ass managed to scrape together enough savings to buy a house. I was over the moon happy, but when I pulled out my phone I realized I had no idea how to contact her and share my joy. And that was it. It was broken. It's ok to not be ok with the terms of your friendship and to scale back accordingly. We only live once, you gotta water the plants that actually grow.", "NTA. I have MDD and have been where your friend is, and while she may truly not be capable of giving you what you need, you have just as much right to take care of yourself as she does. You have been gracious and kind in your explanation to her about your needs and how it impacts you when she ghosts. If she isn\u2019t able to accommodate you then it may be time for you to move on. You don\u2019t have to have a big discussion or formally end your friendship or anything, just move on with your life. If/when she is through this and she wants to be in your life again, she can reach out. If you\u2019re available and want to see her then y\u2019all can do that then. Some friendships are only for a season and that\u2019s ok. They can still hold good memories and y\u2019all can still reconnect every once in while when you\u2019re both in a place to do so.", "NTA. I have a friend with depression and when we lived near each other we were close. Last year i moved to the same town as her and have yet to see her. I stopped asking after month 2. Id love to see her but i understand that her mental health comes first and she doesnt have time for me right now.", "NTA. I had a 'friend' like this in high school. She would want to go to the movies, hang at the mall, have me drive her around. Then, conveniently right before the time we were meant to hang out, she'd feel depressed. I'd get ready and sit there waiting for her to respond to the 'hey, are we still going out?' text and she never would. After a few times, I just couldn't take it anymore. Dropped her and we haven't spoken since, instead I got new friends who actually answer do stuff. You deserve better, OP!", "Not the asshole. But one thing you may want to try is to ask if something else is going on lately because the anger might be coming from some other place. Maybe start with some ego stroking \u201cI like how you\u2019re really into taking care of yourself. That\u2019s something I need to do more of.\u201d Then say \u201cwhat\u2019s been new with you? Has something been getting you down more than usual?\u201d It\u2019s not your responsibility at all and you\u2019re not the asshole (I have crippling depression and, more often, debilitating social anxiety, and with the few friends I have left at this point, I *always* make sure to let them know when plans are gonna fall through. You sound like a very understanding friend and asking for a heads up is totally reasonable. Just saying you could try this other approach if you get really worried about your friend. Sometimes the ego stroking for the other person can reduce their resistance.)", "NTA\n\nBut maybe she should just stay as a phone/text friend. May Stop making plans. They give you both stress.", "NTA. Your friend not only suffers from depression but entitlement as well. Stop making plans with her. You know she will only disappoint you. Let her make the plans and tell her that if you don\u2019t hear from her by a certain time you will move on to do something else. She can and probably will continue to ghost you but you know this already so stop waiting around for her. Always have a back up plan when dealing with her as well as a time limit you will wait for her. Enough is enough!!!", "With all due respect, you\u2019re only TA to yourself to keep this up, and it\u2019s time to break this friendship off. \n\nI used to be ver much the same way and give my 110% into friendships, even if they were toxic. No friendship has to be 50/50, can\u2019t realistically be, but you don\u2019t deserve to be played, whether it\u2019s intentional or not on her part.", "No.  What\u2019s weird is that OP\u2019s friend with crippling depression is too depressed to see OP for plans they agreed on but is NOT too depressed to go shopping the same day. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11709f5/aita_for_asking_my_depressed_friend_not_to_ghost/j99jqd5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "hell yes!\n\nI sometimes get so stressed by the phone ringing and me not calling back, but i almost always try to text and apologize before turning the phone off and going under the blanket. If this person is ok with doing other things and not telling the friend it is just fucked up. She will learn that friends are not that easy to get when you get older and while acting like an ass. I always try to apologize when i am one.\n\nSometimes i tell ppl something just to not have to speak on the phone, or feel like a flaky fuck up but i still apologize."]}
