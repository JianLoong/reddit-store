I had to work around the clock to redo everything.

I sent her an invoice for the materials and the rush delivery fee to redo the damaged work.\n\n(2) The reason this action might make me the asshole is that I\u2019m financially penalizing a family member over a child\u2019s innocent mistake. While I view the artwork as my livelihood and something I put my heart and soul into, others might see it as just art and think I should be more understanding, given the unpredictable nature of children. My sister\u2019s reaction, calling it \u201cjust a drawing\u201d and her refusal to pay, along with the division in my family\u2019s opinions on the matter, makes me wonder if I was too harsh or if I should have absorbed the cost as a family-related loss.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She still has to start all over with sketches and that takes a LOT of work. \nAlso- OP said this project took 10 days of actual painting in the first couple of sentences on this post. It was more than just ruining the sketch.", "Depending on if they are a summer birthday and the parents' decisions, there's a decent chance this 6 year old is just now starting kindergarten", "Yes, I would expect a 6 year old to know not to draw on their friends doodles.\n\nNTA.", "I have a high up slide lock on my home office for this exact reason.", "BOT", "[deleted]", "Actually yes, a 6 year old should know to respect someone else\u2019s property. \n\nI work in a primary school, so\u2026 yeah. The 6 year olds know not to ruin each others work.", "A 6 year old knows what 'no' means. And they still should have watched the kid, if it is leaving the rooms, where it is allowed to play.", "Sorry, used kindergarten but meant day care.", "Yes. The kid is 6, I have taught 6 year olds. They know better than this unless the parents totally dropped the ball.", "[deleted]", "At 6 they know not to draw on other people's pictures. That's a very basic thing they learn at school.", "Yup, they specifically taught us that at preschool. Keep your hands to yourself and your crayons on your own paper."]}
