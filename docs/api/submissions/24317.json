I had to work around the clock to redo everything. It cost me sleep, extra materials, and a rush fee to get some supplies delivered ASAP.\n\nMy sister is now angry with me for sending her an invoice for the damages and we haven\u2019t spoken in days.

I sent her an invoice for the materials and the rush delivery fee to redo the damaged work.\n\n(2) The reason this action might make me the asshole is that I\u2019m financially penalizing a family member over a child\u2019s innocent mistake. While I view the artwork as my livelihood and something I put my heart and soul into, others might see it as just art and think I should be more understanding, given the unpredictable nature of children. My sister\u2019s reaction, calling it \u201cjust a drawing\u201d and her refusal to pay, along with the division in my family\u2019s opinions on the matter, makes me wonder if I was too harsh or if I should have absorbed the cost as a family-related loss.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
