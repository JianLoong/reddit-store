I had to work around the clock to redo everything. It cost me sleep, extra materials, and a rush fee to get some supplies delivered ASAP.\n\nMy sister is now angry with me for sending her an invoice for the damages and we haven\u2019t spoken in days.

I sent her an invoice for the materials and the rush delivery fee to redo the damaged work.\n\n(2) The reason this action might make me the asshole is that I\u2019m financially penalizing a family member over a child\u2019s innocent mistake. While I view the artwork as my livelihood and something I put my heart and soul into, others might see it as just art and think I should be more understanding, given the unpredictable nature of children. My sister\u2019s reaction, calling it \u201cjust a drawing\u201d and her refusal to pay, along with the division in my family\u2019s opinions on the matter, makes me wonder if I was too harsh or if I should have absorbed the cost as a family-related loss.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most states don't require a minimum age, as per your PDF (there's your citation). Only 6 states out of 50, it seems.\n\n*\"designed ; intentional ; malicious.\"* aren't cumulative nor synonymous here.  Many jurisdictions' legislations will explicitly distinguish between malicious and willful, and for a reason.\n\nI think you are mitigating the tort of vandalizing the painting with the additional tort of damages resulting from the vandalizing. Both tort might be sued, even if auntie did technically replace the initial painting by another, different piece of work. The damages would be for the destroyed painting and for the strain resulting from making another one on short notice.\n\nWillfulness doesn't explicitly imply malicious intent, in most states, **but is either explicitly distinct from it, or is the sole criterion. Malicious intent is therefore not a prerequisite, unless explicitly and/or exclusively cited by law, before claiming damages.**\n\nIf an argument was to be made that the child willfully \"added\" to the painting, making it lose its commercial value, even with no malicious intent do to so, then the judge would seek to establish whether the act was indeed willful and whether legislation allowed claims for damages resulting from that willful act.\n\nThe act of painting over the canvas was willful, since the child did mean to paint over it. It wasn't malignant nor negligent, since he didn't mistake the painting for his, he didn't accidentally spill paint or water on it nor fell over it, he didn't wish to sabotage auntie, etc. But it did result in sleep deprivation, pain and money lost for auntie, and threatened her business. Under some jurisdictions, both negligent and willful acts may be tried, besides, but different cases would have to be made for either ground.\n\nFinally, there's nothing petty about this, as insurance might require that the party file a suit, if only to cover another suit in the event that a contractor fail to deliver.\n\nBy law, according to your PDF, the parent is liable to pay damages to the    plaintiff, either limited or unlimited, under the condition, under 6 states' jurisdictions out of 50 states, that the child would have reached either the age of 7 or 10.", "No, saying that a six year old should know better and should be expected to not take other people's things without permission isn't \"hating children\", it's called \"being normal\"."]}
