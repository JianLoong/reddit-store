{"id": 12526, "submission_id": "11twnaj", "title": "AITA for wanting to move out because of my boyfriend's kids?", "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 4 years. I moved into his home 10 months ago and he has 3 sons (10, 14, 16). Originally when I moved in he had limited custody because of his work schedule. The 14 & 16 years old now live almost full-time with him and the 10 year every other week. They teens moved in with him because they weren't getting along with their stepdad, the 16 yo specifically was kicked out by his mom.\n\nBefore the living arrangements changed I was getting along great with my stepsons. However, the relationship has changed since they moved in and I've found myself increasingly uncomfortable living with them. Because I'm around more than their dad (who works a lot) I end up having to discipline or \"snitch\" on them to their dad when they do things they're not supposed to. I regularly catch the oldest smoking in the house, the 14 yo picks on the 10 yo relentlessly, and the 10 yo regularly engages in dangerous play that I have to reign in. I'm not these children's mother or stepmother. They don't want me to discipline them or tell on them to their dad  and we used to have a much friendlier relationship. The thing is if I wasn't living in their home, their dad would most likely just leave them home alone anyway and they could do all the crap they're not supposed to behind his back and I wouldn't have to feel like I have to get involved.\n\nOn top if this living with a man and 3 boys is disgusting. They are messy and gross. We split the chores between myself and my boyfriend, and the boys have chores as well. However, they will often leave messes etc for a while before doing anything about it. They boys are also very rambunctious and loud and are always disturbing my peace. \n\nBecause of all this I told my boyfriend I would start looking for places to move to as I was no longer enjoying my time at his home. At first he thought I was trying to break out with him and even after I tried to assure him I still want to be with him, I don't want to live with him. \n\nHe's now mad at me and thinks I'm being an ass for wanting to move out. He thinks I never should of moved in if I wasn't comfortable with being around his kids. He's happy his kids are now able to spend more time with him and thinks I'm jealous of them because he spends so much of his time with them now.\n\nAita? Is it not reasonable that I don't want to raise kids that aren't mine or have to live in constant noise and mess?", "created_utc": 1679071919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11twnaj/aita_for_wanting_to_move_out_because_of_my/", "score": 1165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those kids, for better or worse are part of the deal. If you don't want them to be part of your life, then you're frozen the relationship in place until they move out. That's not fair to him. \n\nDon't think about the short term because its really kind of long.

Sometimes that's tough to give and to take.  You get to be heard and supported when you lay down the law with the kids.  That said, the law needs to be clearly defined, between you and their dad, AND between the kids and both of you.  It's not fair to anyone of the rules aren't clearly defined, and everyone knows their role in the house.  Those boys should know that you are the \"parent\" in the house,  and they should be expected to behave as such.  Dad needs to be the one to make that clear,  and he should absolutely back you up when you enforce the previously agreed upon ruled. \nI found it helped when the kids were part of the rule-making.

We just saw each other when the kids were at their other parent's house. At first my boyfriend was offended but by the time his sons were 13 both of them were in and out of jail for most of their teen and young adult years. Also as much as I loved my boyfriend I did not want a man in the house who would then want to discipline my sons. He had a way different parenting style than mine.

I don't see much *in your post* about trying to solve the problem before jumping ship. There's probably a lot that's gone on that you don't have time to really spell out here, but I feel like a decision of this magnitude should involve some attempt at compromise before you went to moving out. If you're living together, this is obviously a serious relationship, but this seems a bit flippant on your part only knowing what I know. If the relationship is not that serious, moving in together was probably a bad decision given how it had the potential to affect the kids' stability. Idk...it just all seems a little myopic to me. \n\nYou mention he's away from home more than you because he works a lot. That, in and of itself, is not a problem, and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how that equates to him, \"abandoning\" his children, as another poster said. Maybe there was no discussion about how someone was going to supervise his kids because you would be there, and he assumed you would take that responsibility. If that's true...he shouldn't have assumed that. An additional problem here is that you are his gf, not his wife, so the kids likely aren't going to respect your authority unless he backs you up. That's why clear cut rules and regulations are necessary, and then the kids should understand that the rules are enforced regardless of who is the adult in charge at the moment. And that part is up to him. He would have to \"deputize\" you, for lack of a better word, and then uphold his own rules. \n\nThe kids moved in full time with y'all because they didn't get along with their stepdad...sounds like the biological parents need to get their ish together. It's giving chaotic, and that probably contributes to the kids' behavior and lack of respect for you and their environment. Now, you said the boys will leave messes for \"a while\" before doing anything about it, but you didn't mention how long \"a while\" is, or what your definition of \"messes\" is. Do they leave dishes in the sink or in the kitchen after cooking themselves a snack for...idk...several hours, but then take it upon themselves to clean it up? If that's the level we're talking here, I don't think that's a huge deal. Do they leave cereal and milk in the floor and on the couch where they spilled it at 8am and only come to try and clean it up 14 hours later because dad's coming home after you've yelled and screamed all day and the milk has soured and the cereal has hardened and stained the carpet and couch?

But, like I said I am in one specific part of the world with a what could be a curious situation seen from one persons eyes. judging by the \"mum\" I would say UK or Australia. which could be completely different culture norms or gender norms. I am sorry if I caused you stress", "OP needs to inform the father and ask him to step up in his role as a parent because I can 100% assure you, being punished by a step parent, as a teenager is just going to cause problems between them. No 16 yo wants to be punished by their father\u2019s girlfriend.", "She\u2019s not even a step parent. She has no authority, outside of being an adult, which means little to nothing. If the father won\u2019t take responsibility for them, she needs no move.", "You do realize you can date someone without living together right?", "If you are used to men stepping up then firstly, you should see that his behaviour is wrong. Expecting his girlfriend to be the main caregiver with none of the authority, not doing anything about her concerns and for not being there for his kids when they have clearly had a rough time with their mother so need a parent! Also \u201chaving kids dumped on him\u201d is wrong. They are his children. What about when he divorced their mum and had limited custody were the kids dumped on her?! No she just did what any single parent (mum) does and looked after them. It\u2019s questionable whether she did a good job but I doubt she had a partner to drop it all on like he has and he does. It\u2019s great that you grew up on a culture where dads are involved and actually that is more and more the norm everywhere, but this is about a dad who isn\u2019t stepping up as a primary parent. I am the primary parent of two young children and I work one full time job and two part time ones and I am still the one who parents my children and any adult entrusted to look after them whether it\u2019s a partner, grandparent, friend, my children are expected to treat them with the respect of an adult in charge and that is the least OP deserves. Genuinely their mother has nothing to do with OPs problems", "She doesn\u2019t want a life free of kids. She doesn\u2019t want to be playing the role of step-mom when she\u2019s a girlfriend.

I wonder if their stepdad wasn\u2019t putting up with this bull crap (smoking in the house?) and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t get along. The dad needs to parent HIS children, not leave it up to his girlfriend.", "NTA. BUT, take this as a lesson.  When involved with someone with children, always anticipate the custody terms can change.  Those kids that only came on weekends very well may end up living with you full time.

When they are responsible for everything their attitudes may change. If not then  you can move on.", "NTA. \n\nGirlfriend, move out now. Glad it's already in the plans.

He thinks a little too highly of himself and the boys considering he isn't even around enough to deal with them.\n\nI'd ask does he want me to be his girlfriend or does he want you as his wife and to be a stepmom.

That's a bad parent. He's simply pawned off the new situation on to you. There is a reason the teens weren't getting along with the stepfather, and it's likely the reason they are no longer getting along as well with you - rule enforcement.

It won't get better until he actually parents, and with you there, he has no need to.", "YTA but not for the reasons you think.  You knew about these kids before you moved in with their father (and he was their father way before he became your boyfriend).  They are a package deal with their dad.  What if their mother had gotten ill and wasn't able to take care of them?  You'd be in the same situation.  You didn't really think about what you were getting into.\n\nWhen my brother got serious about his (now wife) girlfriend, he sat his two daughters down and told them \"If you are ever with G and I'm not around, G is in charge.  What she says goes.  Don't ever let me hear you disobeyed her or disrespected her.\"  For her part, G always made sure to include the girls in her weekend plans with my brother.  Did the girls make messes?  Yes.  Did she complain and whine about them?  No.  She did let it be known that the longer it took them to clean up the mess, the less time they'd have to do whatever fun activity they had planned.  The girls got really good at cleaning up after themselves without being told.  They view G as a trusted adult that they can discuss all sorts of things with.  They know she will maintain their confidence unless she determines it's something their bio-parents have to know about.  She's told them what factors she considers before sharing such things and, as a result, the girls still share with her even knowing she will tell their mom and dad about it.\n\nG understood that the man she was marrying was a package deal.  She blended seamlessly into the family because of that.  NTA for wanting to move out but YTA for the attitude that led to this situation.", "NTA you are being incredibly reasonable.

Hubby gave in and I am still on excellent terms with the kids (adults now, dad passed away some time ago). It took a few years to establish a good relationship with them but it was worth it. One told me recently that I was a bit hard on them as kids but they appreciated that as they got older.", "NTA\u2026.you didn\u2019t sign on to be a step mother to 3 kids living under one roof full time with your role being that of primary caretaker.

Did it ever occur to you that their mother could die? She could go to jail? There are tons of reasons that a parent can end up with full custody when they just enjoy being weekend parents. I had a friend who fell into the same trap. He saw the kids twice a month, and the rest of the time my friend lived in bliss in a beautiful house with the man of her dreams. Until suddenly at 34, Mommy dearest was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was arrested multiple times for doing crack and heroin. Suddenly they had full custody of a 13-year-old, 12-year-old and 10-year-old boys. She had to bail, and let me tell you, it was the right decision.", "NTA sounds like he was pretty comfortable with you playing house and stepping in as a step mom without any of the risk that comes with marriage.
