{"id": 12526, "submission_id": "11twnaj", "title": "AITA for wanting to move out because of my boyfriend's kids?", "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 4 years. I moved into his home 10 months ago and he has 3 sons (10, 14, 16). Originally when I moved in he had limited custody because of his work schedule. The 14 & 16 years old now live almost full-time with him and the 10 year every other week. They teens moved in with him because they weren't getting along with their stepdad, the 16 yo specifically was kicked out by his mom.\n\nBefore the living arrangements changed I was getting along great with my stepsons. However, the relationship has changed since they moved in and I've found myself increasingly uncomfortable living with them. Because I'm around more than their dad (who works a lot) I end up having to discipline or \"snitch\" on them to their dad when they do things they're not supposed to. I regularly catch the oldest smoking in the house, the 14 yo picks on the 10 yo relentlessly, and the 10 yo regularly engages in dangerous play that I have to reign in. I'm not these children's mother or stepmother. They don't want me to discipline them or tell on them to their dad  and we used to have a much friendlier relationship. The thing is if I wasn't living in their home, their dad would most likely just leave them home alone anyway and they could do all the crap they're not supposed to behind his back and I wouldn't have to feel like I have to get involved.\n\nOn top if this living with a man and 3 boys is disgusting. They are messy and gross. We split the chores between myself and my boyfriend, and the boys have chores as well. However, they will often leave messes etc for a while before doing anything about it. They boys are also very rambunctious and loud and are always disturbing my peace. \n\nBecause of all this I told my boyfriend I would start looking for places to move to as I was no longer enjoying my time at his home. At first he thought I was trying to break out with him and even after I tried to assure him I still want to be with him, I don't want to live with him. \n\nHe's now mad at me and thinks I'm being an ass for wanting to move out. He thinks I never should of moved in if I wasn't comfortable with being around his kids. He's happy his kids are now able to spend more time with him and thinks I'm jealous of them because he spends so much of his time with them now.\n\nAita? Is it not reasonable that I don't want to raise kids that aren't mine or have to live in constant noise and mess?", "created_utc": 1679071919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11twnaj/aita_for_wanting_to_move_out_because_of_my/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those kids, for better or worse are part of the deal. If you don't want them to be part of your life, then you're frozen the relationship in place until they move out. That's not fair to him. \n\nDon't think about the short term because its really kind of long.

Sometimes that's tough to give and to take.  You get to be heard and supported when you lay down the law with the kids.  That said, the law needs to be clearly defined, between you and their dad, AND between the kids and both of you.  It's not fair to anyone of the rules aren't clearly defined, and everyone knows their role in the house.  Those boys should know that you are the \"parent\" in the house,  and they should be expected to behave as such.  Dad needs to be the one to make that clear,  and he should absolutely back you up when you enforce the previously agreed upon ruled. \nI found it helped when the kids were part of the rule-making.

We just saw each other when the kids were at their other parent's house. At first my boyfriend was offended but by the time his sons were 13 both of them were in and out of jail for most of their teen and young adult years. Also as much as I loved my boyfriend I did not want a man in the house who would then want to discipline my sons. He had a way different parenting style than mine.

His kids should understand that this is everyone's home and that Dad's rules apply whether Dad is there or not.", "Agreed but they aren\u2019t married.
