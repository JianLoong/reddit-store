{"id": 12526, "submission_id": "11twnaj", "title": "AITA for wanting to move out because of my boyfriend's kids?", "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 4 years. I moved into his home 10 months ago and he has 3 sons (10, 14, 16). Originally when I moved in he had limited custody because of his work schedule. The 14 & 16 years old now live almost full-time with him and the 10 year every other week. They teens moved in with him because they weren't getting along with their stepdad, the 16 yo specifically was kicked out by his mom.\n\nBefore the living arrangements changed I was getting along great with my stepsons. However, the relationship has changed since they moved in and I've found myself increasingly uncomfortable living with them. Because I'm around more than their dad (who works a lot) I end up having to discipline or \"snitch\" on them to their dad when they do things they're not supposed to. I regularly catch the oldest smoking in the house, the 14 yo picks on the 10 yo relentlessly, and the 10 yo regularly engages in dangerous play that I have to reign in. I'm not these children's mother or stepmother. They don't want me to discipline them or tell on them to their dad  and we used to have a much friendlier relationship. The thing is if I wasn't living in their home, their dad would most likely just leave them home alone anyway and they could do all the crap they're not supposed to behind his back and I wouldn't have to feel like I have to get involved.\n\nOn top if this living with a man and 3 boys is disgusting. They are messy and gross. We split the chores between myself and my boyfriend, and the boys have chores as well. However, they will often leave messes etc for a while before doing anything about it. They boys are also very rambunctious and loud and are always disturbing my peace. \n\nBecause of all this I told my boyfriend I would start looking for places to move to as I was no longer enjoying my time at his home. At first he thought I was trying to break out with him and even after I tried to assure him I still want to be with him, I don't want to live with him. \n\nHe's now mad at me and thinks I'm being an ass for wanting to move out. He thinks I never should of moved in if I wasn't comfortable with being around his kids. He's happy his kids are now able to spend more time with him and thinks I'm jealous of them because he spends so much of his time with them now.\n\nAita? Is it not reasonable that I don't want to raise kids that aren't mine or have to live in constant noise and mess?", "created_utc": 1679071919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11twnaj/aita_for_wanting_to_move_out_because_of_my/", "score": 2145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those kids, for better or worse are part of the deal. If you don't want them to be part of your life, then you're frozen the relationship in place until they move out. That's not fair to him. \n\nDon't think about the short term because its really kind of long.

Sometimes that's tough to give and to take.  You get to be heard and supported when you lay down the law with the kids.  That said, the law needs to be clearly defined, between you and their dad, AND between the kids and both of you.  It's not fair to anyone of the rules aren't clearly defined, and everyone knows their role in the house.  Those boys should know that you are the \"parent\" in the house,  and they should be expected to behave as such.  Dad needs to be the one to make that clear,  and he should absolutely back you up when you enforce the previously agreed upon ruled. \nI found it helped when the kids were part of the rule-making.

We just saw each other when the kids were at their other parent's house. At first my boyfriend was offended but by the time his sons were 13 both of them were in and out of jail for most of their teen and young adult years. Also as much as I loved my boyfriend I did not want a man in the house who would then want to discipline my sons. He had a way different parenting style than mine.

I don't see much *in your post* about trying to solve the problem before jumping ship. There's probably a lot that's gone on that you don't have time to really spell out here, but I feel like a decision of this magnitude should involve some attempt at compromise before you went to moving out. If you're living together, this is obviously a serious relationship, but this seems a bit flippant on your part only knowing what I know. If the relationship is not that serious, moving in together was probably a bad decision given how it had the potential to affect the kids' stability. Idk...it just all seems a little myopic to me. \n\nYou mention he's away from home more than you because he works a lot. That, in and of itself, is not a problem, and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how that equates to him, \"abandoning\" his children, as another poster said. Maybe there was no discussion about how someone was going to supervise his kids because you would be there, and he assumed you would take that responsibility. If that's true...he shouldn't have assumed that. An additional problem here is that you are his gf, not his wife, so the kids likely aren't going to respect your authority unless he backs you up. That's why clear cut rules and regulations are necessary, and then the kids should understand that the rules are enforced regardless of who is the adult in charge at the moment. And that part is up to him. He would have to \"deputize\" you, for lack of a better word, and then uphold his own rules. \n\nThe kids moved in full time with y'all because they didn't get along with their stepdad...sounds like the biological parents need to get their ish together. It's giving chaotic, and that probably contributes to the kids' behavior and lack of respect for you and their environment. Now, you said the boys will leave messes for \"a while\" before doing anything about it, but you didn't mention how long \"a while\" is, or what your definition of \"messes\" is. Do they leave dishes in the sink or in the kitchen after cooking themselves a snack for...idk...several hours, but then take it upon themselves to clean it up? If that's the level we're talking here, I don't think that's a huge deal. Do they leave cereal and milk in the floor and on the couch where they spilled it at 8am and only come to try and clean it up 14 hours later because dad's coming home after you've yelled and screamed all day and the milk has soured and the cereal has hardened and stained the carpet and couch?

But, like I said I am in one specific part of the world with a what could be a curious situation seen from one persons eyes. judging by the \"mum\" I would say UK or Australia. which could be completely different culture norms or gender norms. I am sorry if I caused you stress", "OP needs to inform the father and ask him to step up in his role as a parent because I can 100% assure you, being punished by a step parent, as a teenager is just going to cause problems between them.

Also \u201chaving kids dumped on him\u201d is wrong. They are his children. What about when he divorced their mum and had limited custody were the kids dumped on her?! No she just did what any single parent (mum) does and looked after them. It\u2019s questionable whether she did a good job but I doubt she had a partner to drop it all on like he has and he does. It\u2019s great that you grew up on a culture where dads are involved and actually that is more and more the norm everywhere, but this is about a dad who isn\u2019t stepping up as a primary parent. I am the primary parent of two young children and I work one full time job and two part time ones and I am still the one who parents my children and any adult entrusted to look after them whether it\u2019s a partner, grandparent, friend, my children are expected to treat them with the respect of an adult in charge and that is the least OP deserves.

No.  She did let it be known that the longer it took them to clean up the mess, the less time they'd have to do whatever fun activity they had planned.

And their arguments are always the same: age doesn't matter (it does, otherwise they wouldn't want to date a certain age), there's nothing wrong with wanting younger (morally, I agree, but practically speaking, different life stages can be rough), & it's not even that big of an age gap (I'm 34 and while dating a 27yo isn't unimaginable, I'm also very aware at 27 I had a completely different set of priorities than I do now, and younger partners may likely not be on my wavelength).\n\nThe fact that so many people's response is basically \"nothing wrong with it, I can do what I want!\" belies a certain level of emotional/relational immaturity and not getting what makes LTRs work.", "Yes but that rule is about romantic attachment, not having all the responsibility of a stepmother without any of the rights.
