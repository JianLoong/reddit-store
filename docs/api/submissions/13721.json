I had found a group of people getting to their car and decided to stop and wait for them to leave so I could park there. I had been waiting there for about 5 minutes with my blinker on and right when I was about to back in another car pulled in at the same time as me and then started honking and squeezed her way in. I was pissed so I put my car in park where it was and got out of my car and said \u201care you fucking serious, I\u2019ve been waiting for that spot.\u201dthe young woman was offended and said she didn\u2019t know that and how was she supposed to know, to which I said I had pulled forward so that the car could back out and I had my blinker on right next to the spot. She then said \u201cwell you could\u2019ve asked for it instead of cussing at me, so good luck on finding a parking spot\u201d. I realized she wasn\u2019t a reasonable person at that point and didn\u2019t say anything to that and just left. Now I\u2019m thinking back and I think I could\u2019ve handled that situation better but don\u2019t regret confronting her. So AITA?\n\nEdit: the parking lot was not built well in the section I was parking in. It was the end of the parking lot and shaped like a triangle so I had to pull forward of the parking spot to allow traffic to flow around me while I waited for the spot. I normally don\u2019t back in but had no other options.\n\nTo help paint a better picture, I was about 8 feet away at the rear of my car when I was talking to her (i was only yelling loud enough for her to hear)", "created_utc": 1680356877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128myiz/aita_for_yelling_at_a_woman_in_the_parking_lot/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you are backing into a parking spot you need to pull past the parking spot to back into it. She most likely thought you were not going to use the spot and pulled in. An honest mistake. It\u2019s what I would have thought. Even having your blinker on would not have clued me in that you planned to back into the spot. So, yeah if you hadn\u2019t blown up at her and explained in a kind manner, you had a better chance.  \n\nEdited to add. OP, your edit to your original post doesn\u2019t change my judgment. If anything it reinforced it because you admit your actions are out of the ordinary for that parking lot.", "YTA. it's just a parking spot. clearly you had the time to waste if you were already there for an hour trying to find a spot. there's no reason to lose your temper over a minor inconvenience like this.", "YTA. You were beyond the parking spot and she couldn't have known you were going to back up. You could have been polite and explained rather than jumping to anger. You immediately went to cursing at her. That is a bit irrational.", "YTA - she wasn\u2019t a reasonable person because she didn\u2019t want to deal with your attitude? most people would have walked away from you if you came at them like that.\n\nnext time check your ego and discuss it like a fucking adult. or, even better, realize that a parking space isn\u2019t worth initiating confrontations over.", "ESH. She was in the wrong but...if you hadn't been so rude, a lot of people would've said 'my bad' and vacated the space.", "ESH. Stay in your car.", "ESH. I understand being angry at the other driver, but it's possible that she genuinely didn't realise you were waiting for the spot. If that driver had been me, I would've given way to another car if the driver politely called out they'd been waiting to park there, whereas if someone cussed at me over a misunderstanding, I'd pull into that spot and basically not move my car from it for the next year.", "YTA. It sounds like there was enough chaos in that parking lot that this woman deserves the benefit of the doubt. It's also never a good look for you to yell and swear at a young woman as a man in public because that introduces a possible threat into the situation.", "ESH.  Although she may have been able to figure out what space you were waiting for most people don\u2019t pass the spot and then wait with their signal on, even when backing in.  From what I\u2019ve seen they stop before the space and then when it\u2019s vacated they pull up and back in.  Also, if your goal was for her to give the space to you going off on her was never going to accomplish that.", "YTA she genuinely may not have known or wasn\u2019t paying attention and didn\u2019t see you waiting to park. Going in guns blazing and cussing at her was not the way to handle it. You should have been more polite", "ESH.  I think she did know you wanted the spot, but she probably would have backed down if you'd asked her politely and killed her with kindness.  But you didn't, you yelled and you swore.  So she doubled down.  So to me, you both suck.", "ESH What where you going to accomplish by yelling at her?", "ESH\n\nShe did you dirty but you also went off on her.", "YTA. It\u2019s a parking spot \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Driving around for an hour looking for a parking spot is crazy! But emotions run high when someone swoops in and takes what you thought was yours. NTA though.", "Nobody has any common courtesy anymore. Whenever I drive anywhere myself in the state I live in people cut me off flying straight through stop signs, drive way below the speed limit, don't use blinkers, shoot through red lights, speed up in the right lane to match my speed when lanes merge.... I could go in and on. \n\nYou clearly had a blinker on to indicate you wanted said spot. Only thing to make it more clear would be to roll down the window and scream \"I'm taking this spot here, so please don't\". \n\nWoman was a jerk for taking the spot when you had your blinker on. I say you acted pretty accordingly by cussing at her. Parking lots are the absolute worse when trying to finally find a spot and of course someone has to cut you off to grab it. \n\nNTA, screw that woman.", "You should have been nicer, but ESH.", "NTA. Everybody knows this is a dick move.", "NTA. You could have handled it better, yes. But her implying that if you had asked nicely she would have given it to you is a load of bs.", "I\u2019m going with a very soft NTA.  What I want to know is what I\u2019m earth was so important that you waited an HOUR to find a parking spot? Was there nowhere relatively nearby that you could park and walk?", "NTA. The woman made a completely di*k move", "Nta. She was the ah.", "NTA but should have handled it in a more rational manner than letting your emotions get the best of you. People suck. There are many AHs about and, as much as it sucks, the best thing you can do is not let it get to you so bad.", "ESH, including car culture because driving somewhere to wait an HOUR for a parking spot is absurd. Thank you for contributing to environmental pollution and climate change, I hope your shopping trip was worth it.", "NTA\u2014\u2014 she knew you were waiting for the spot! Also, some people may have even keyed her car or damaged it in some other way.  It\u2019s not worth the aggravation to \u201csteal\u201d someone\u2019s parking spot.", "NTA.  she does not seem to know parking etiquette, and at that point you were stressed and it got the better of you. No one was hurt, you walked away without further confrontation. It was a moment that's passed over just a parking spot. It's going to inform your future response to people when you feel stressed and it might help you maintain perspective . Most of us would have yelled, either director at the person or just in our car, after all that when someone swoops in and takes the spot you clearly indicated you were waiting for. Let it go.", "ESH - woman who pirated your parking spot is a much bigger AH though. I would have fucked with her car. At the very least, she would\u2019ve ended up with a flat tire when she got out, and anyone who pulls a stunt like that should reasonably expect their car to be fucked with.", "NTA\n\nNext time break her mirror", "NTA.  She's either an idiot or willfully ignorant and should learn parking lot etiquette because people will absolutely get physical about it, especially if she acts like that about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
