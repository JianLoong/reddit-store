I had found a group of people getting to their car and decided to stop and wait for them to leave so I could park there. I had been waiting there for about 5 minutes with my blinker on and right when I was about to back in another car pulled in at the same time as me and then started honking and squeezed their way in. I was pissed so I put my car in park where it was and got out of my car and said \u201care you fucking serious, I\u2019ve been waiting for that spot.\u201d the woman was offended and got out of her car and said she didn\u2019t know that and how was she supposed to know, to which I said I had pulled forward so that the car could back out and I had my blinker on right next to the spot. She then said \u201cwell you could\u2019ve asked for it instead of cussing at me, so good luck on finding a parking spot\u201d. At that point I didn\u2019t say anything to that and just left. Now I\u2019m thinking back and I think I could\u2019ve handled that situation better but don\u2019t regret confronting her. So AITA?\n\nEdit: the parking lot was not built well in the section I was parking in. It was the end of the parking lot and shaped like a triangle so I had to pull forward of the parking spot to allow traffic to flow around me while I waited for the spot. I had my rear backup light on as well. I saw the parking spot about 5 minutes later and she had left the parking spot.\n\nTo help paint a better picture, I was about 8 feet away at the rear of my car when I was talking to her (i was only yelling loud enough for her to hear)", "created_utc": 1680356877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128myiz/aita_for_yelling_at_a_woman_in_the_parking_lot/", "score": 334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
