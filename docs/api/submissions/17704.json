I'm Hispanic/Native American, he's white. \n\nI'll just put this out there: my husband's family is racist. Let's just say they were very happy during the last presidential administration. It wasn't so bad when my husband Jack and I started dating, as his mother usually kept her opinions to herself. But as most things did, her opinions changed (or came to the surface) during 2017-2021. Suddenly his family was posting all over social media about their horrible beliefs and how much they hate POCs. This was extremely awkward because my family used to be friends with them on social media so this led to a lot of arguments and now our families don't speak. In fact, things escalated and there was a huge blowout argument between my mom and his, and now my mom HATES his mother. My husband defends us every time and goes low contact with his family when things get out of hand. This has been going on for 10 years and I've been very understanding and nice to them and even attend events with the promise that there will be nothing controversial brought up. \n\nHowever, things are changing and they are becoming more and more brazen. They post downright disgusting things on social media (I have since muted them), and I'm done. We are supposed to take a trip to see his family for a week in July and I refuse to go now. First, I can't stand his family anymore, and second this trip is with his family and their horrible friends who literally hold rallies with certain flags supporting a former president every year and believe very radical things. I know on this trip people will be drinking and inhibitions will be down, which means there will be nothing holding them back from saying anything they want. I know for a fact if I go and something is said, I will absolutely blow up. So I told my husband I'm done and from now on I refuse to attend anything with his family. \n\nHe's very sad as he's worried this will make me look bad and like I don't care about them or like them. He worries this will make me look uncaring, and at this point I don't care anymore. We've been arguing for a few days now because his point is that he wants us to get along and he'll tell his parents to tone it down. He said he wants me on the trip with him and I'm not budging, telling him I'd rather spend that time with my family instead. He already feels like I'm cold enough as it is with his family and we don't spend enough time with them. \n\nReddit, AITA if I cut contact with them, don't go on this stupid trip and from now on make him attend family events by himself?", "created_utc": 1684529694, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m7h6e/aita_for_no_longer_wanting_to_associate_with_my/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s got some priorities out of whack. \n\nThis is a matter of safety for you as well as comfort, and he should not be telling his family to tone it down - he should be telling them to cut it out.", "Oh god NTA at all! And your husband should 100% be on your side with this. No excuses.\n\nThere is zero reasons you should ever associate with people who are actively racist & disrespecting you. None. Don\u2019t budge OP, you deserve better.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have an in-law problem. You have a husband problem. The fact he's willing to associate with these people is pretty obviously telling that they're not the only racists in the family. He's one too.", "NTA your husband should absolutely have been trying harder to educate his family before it became such a problem, how many times has he let this slide. he should never allow his family to disrespect his wife and her family regardless of the reason. but especially when this is the reason.", "NTA-I\u2019m sorry but what you need is to  cut contact with your husband.\n\nHis family are blatantly racist towards you and he STILL wants you to spend time with them.

Well, no shit. You don't, and decent people in general don't. NTA", "NTA but why are you not more mad at your husband?!  WTF?", "NTA - ask your husband, why he cares about what a bunch of racist A Hs think? If he thinks they're wrong ; it shouldn't matter. He should be more concerned about how they looked.", "Your husband has had 10 years to get his racist family to \"tone it down\". The fact that he still thinks it's ok to pressure you into spending time with them for the sake of appearances, knowing the full extent not only of their beliefs, but also of their behavior, is a huge red flag. He cannot have both. He cannot have a POC wife and still be on good terms with people who openly hate POC. He needs to choose, or you do. NTA.", "Idk what the hell happened in the last few years but the right wingers went CRAZY. I don\u2019t talk to half my family because of disgusting things they have said and continue saying. It\u2019s like people don\u2019t even have personalities anymore, it\u2019s all political and it\u2019s sad and gross. You can be into politics and not be an AH. But apparently people forgot that lol. NTA. You have to do what is necessary for your OWN peace. I don\u2019t know why he would want you to be in that situation with them in the first place.", "NTA\n\nEveryone here has already said basically what I feel. But I do want to say this: Trips and visiting family are meant to be relaxing and fun for you and your husband. If you feel that going to this place has a high chance of making you stressed and ruining parts of your life for a while, then that defeats the purpose of going. Even if you did go and they don't cause problems, it still would not be fun to hang out with people who you know are secretly judging you and that the only reason they aren't full-on attacking your character is cause of a promise they made. You should tell your husband about this and let him know that the point of a vacation is fun, and that going would not be fun to you. If he still insists on you going, then his entire family is the asshole including him.", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this shit", "Nta, I would ask your husband how would he feel being around your family if they posted stuff about hating white people.", "NTA\n\nWtf is wrong with your husband? Seriously? Why is he putting his family, who espouse disgusting and demeaning belief which completely invalidate not just an entire group of people\u2019s humanity, but YOUR humanity above his WIFE.\n\nI am so very sad for you. I get that it\u2019s hard to cut ties from family, but what  your husband is doing is completely inexcusable. And anyone that is ok with spending time with family that actively denigrates people, including your spouse who should be your number one priority, is not worthy of being a spouse.\n\nWhy does his family get told to tone it down? Why is he ok with \u201ctoned down\u201d. And before we get the dumb, \u201cbut new-maw is old, but papa loves YOU, but they weren\u2019t as bad last time, but iT\u2019s mY fAMilY!!\u201d Well guess what buttercup, that\u2019s all BS and some weak garbage of an excuse.\n\nI have conservatives white in laws. I\u2019m Hispanic. My husband is white.  So I understand how nuanced this situation can be.\n\nBut your husband needs to pull his head out of the sand and decide if he wants to be an apologist push-over that has so little value for his wife\u2019s feelings that he\u2019s willing to sacrifice your comfort and peace on the alter of his family\u2019s white supremacy OR if he wants to be your partner. Because a real partner would not be ok with how he\u2019s been acting. \n\nAnd OP\u2019s husband, if you\u2019re reading this\u2026. Shame on you. You either get to be a good person or you get to be a an alt-right apologist. It truly is that black and white. Why in the world do you think what you\u2019re doing is ok?", "NTA. If they're that radical, in a big group and will be drinking it's literally not safe for you to be in that environment. Your husband is overestimating himself thinking he can \"just ask to tone it down\" when they're this aggressive. Good job on him for standing up for you but he can stand up some more and have your back in this situation. It's literally not safe.", "I am a Christian married to a Jewish man and that is one of the reasons his sisters never wanted me in the role of wifey. I am also racially ambiguous and they don't love that either. \ud83e\udd23I don't actually care about them enough to let them stress me with the nonsense. But, I did draw the line at how much time I was willing to endure their vile personalities many years ago.\n\nI have always encouraged him to be around them without me. And I have never forced my children to endure them for so much as an afternoon. *\"Bad people make bad company, so you are on your own with that. You go build a better mousetrap of a relationship with the bigots. I can't make them stop being bigots. But, I can set terms for how people treat me.*\n\n*\"I know you love them and you get to love your family. That does not mean I am suffering through this. That's way too much to ask of me. And I've put in enough time in this hell that I'm over doing penance for the sin of not being just like you. I don't owe anyone my dignity or my peace of mind.\"*\n\nI haven't been in the same room as my SILs for a couple years now. And the peace has been wondrous. I was honest with myself before I was honest with my husband. And I can't love people who treat me poorly. Some distance allows me to respect myself and them too.\n\nNTA. No way. I have no idea why people think anyone would flagellate themselves and be on the cross just because they were born into a family of bigots. That's why in-laws aren't in the marriage vows, I guess? Taking your power back doesn't make you look bad. It makes you look stronger, independent and resolute. ;-)", "NTA. And why should you care about bigots. The fact your hubs is worried about how you will look to his family is very troubling tho. He should have your back 1000%. He can still have a relationship with them. But by no means should you be subject to their bigotry just for the sake of appearance.", "NTA You need to keep yourself SAFE above all other things. We all saw what happened on Jan 6th, people got HURT and other people were responsible for harming them.  Never underestimate the power of stupidity that occurs when large groups of people come together. MOB MENTALITY is an ACTUAL SOCIAL ISSUE, especially right now. These people are committing violence in the NAME of patriotism and you truly have NO IDEA what may set one of them over the edge, and once one jumps that police barricade either literal or figurative, the rest WILL FOLLOW, chaos and pandemonium will ensue and someone could end up in the hospital or the morgue. It is being played out ALL OVER THE COUNTRYand you honestly cannot trust that you WILL 100% BE SAFE because of all these factors. Let your husband read this, because I don't think he has really considered that the behavior exhibited by these people is extremely cultish, dangerous and VERY unreasonable...as in you CANNOT REASON WITH them. Keep yourself safe and hold your ground, this IS a hill to die on because you LITERALLY COULD GET HURT...or worse.", "NTA!!! My in-laws are the same way (though a little quieter about it). It's THEIR actions that are causing you to cut contact, not yours. You deserve to feel safe and loved with family, if you don't then it's 1000% justifiable to cut contact. Who gives AF if they think you like them or not, actions have consequences and it's time they faced theirs. \n\nHow nice will it be not to have to use vacation time to go visit them anymore!?\n\nI hope that your husband remains supportive and understanding.", "I\u2019m a white woman that grew up in the Midwest and I am absolutely abhorred by this behavior from your husband\u2019s family. You have every right to cut contact with them. It\u2019s disgusting.", "NTA. And your marriage is doomed if he\u2019s telling you to suck it up to spend time with racists. You should probably spend that time alone talking to a divorce lawyer because as it stands this should be a deal breaker. He\u2019s married to a POC, if racism doesn\u2019t bother him it\u2019s because he\u2019s decided \u201cyou\u2019re one of the good ones\u201d.", "NTA. So... your husband wants to put you in harm's way because other than that YOU will look bad, and like you don't like or care for them?\n\nIt's time to tell your husband you don't care how you look. But it says a lot about him how he chooses to focus on you not going instead of them being racist.", "Holy shit... you don't only have an in law problem, you have a husband problem.  The fact that your husband wants to put you in a situation like that is insane.  Does he watch the news?  People are getting shot just for turning around in somebody's driveway, what does he think a bunch of drunk racist a-holes will do when you show up... not being white?\n\nDo not back down and do not go.  Your husband needs to get his priorities in check.  His family is horrible and expecting you to just keep the peace is complete bullshit.\n\nHonestly, if I were you I would tell him that he has a choice to make... me or his racist a-hole family because he can't have both.", "NTA.  Take your husband to a bar, party, something that is exclusively black people or native people. Something where he is the only white person there. Order drinks, dinner, and have a good time.  If he kicks up a fuss or says he doesn't feel safe, tell him to suck it up. That's how you feel around his family every damn time.

He can tolerate them, even though they can't do the same for your very existence. \n\nI dearly hope you don't intend to have children with this man.

To the husband, they exist in more than one dimension. They aren't just bigots in his mind, is my point. And I won't make excuses for him.

They're sum is much better than their parts to him?\n\nMy own husband's family is a small and merry band of racist ass holes, IMO. I don't want to be bothered with them.

They are your family and have been for you entire life. If this happened to me, I would not disavow my family because of it.
