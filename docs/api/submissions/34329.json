She was browsing through the different flavors and was asking my three siblings which one she should pick. I don\u2019t know how to put this but the image of my siblings going \u201cooh ooh pick that one\u201d and \u201cthis one would taste so good!\u201d looked kinda off to me and the store owner seemed to agree judging by his expression. My 18yo sister already vapes and my mom doesn\u2019t care so I\u2019m a bit worried about my other sibs. I said \u201csetting a fine example mom\u201d as I was looking around the store and didn\u2019t think much of it. She didn\u2019t say anything and I thought that was over but when we exited the shop my mom said that I embarrassed her in front of the store owner and that I shouldn\u2019t talk to my mother in that way. I apologized but she still seems angry. Looking back I shouldn\u2019t have put her in that spot and she\u2019s free to do whatever she wants so AITA?", "created_utc": 1704389737, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yisa0/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_being_a_bad_role/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s one thing to get a vape with your kids present, but asking them what flavor to pick is just bad parenting.\n\nDoes she take them to the liquor store and ask them what kind of alcohol she should buy?", "NTA, you were right and your mom embarrassed herself", "NTA. Her being cross and embarrassed is indication that she knows she did wrong. You were just the one to point it out. I doubt she\u2019ll do it again.", "NTA. You just can't do that. How is she more embarassed from you calling her out over her letting your UNDERAGE siblings choose vape flavors. I'm sorry but she needs help.", "NTA", "i am sorry that between you and your mom, its you who is the adult. you didnt emberass her, her nehaviour did\n\nNTA", "100% NTA.\n\nshe is free to do what she wants when kids aren't around, but asking her children about vape flavors is crossing the line.", "Inform her that judging by the look he was giving her, that she was doing a fine job all on her own.

She did this to herself unfortunately", "NTA. The more embarrassed she was, the better. She should be ASHAMED for engaging her kids over vaping and allowing her 18-year-old to vape. Well the 18-year-old is an adult, but it's such a bad sign.", "NTA - It seems the store owner agreed with you and *she* embarrassed herself.
