She was browsing through the different flavors and was asking my three siblings which one she should pick. I don\u2019t know how to put this but the image of my siblings going \u201cooh ooh pick that one\u201d and \u201cthis one would taste so good!\u201d looked kinda off to me and the store owner seemed to agree judging by his expression. My 18yo sister already vapes and my mom doesn\u2019t care so I\u2019m a bit worried about my other sibs. I said \u201csetting a fine example mom\u201d as I was looking around the store and didn\u2019t think much of it. She didn\u2019t say anything and I thought that was over but when we exited the shop my mom said that I embarrassed her in front of the store owner and that I shouldn\u2019t talk to my mother in that way. I apologized but she still seems angry. Looking back I shouldn\u2019t have put her in that spot and she\u2019s free to do whatever she wants so AITA?", "created_utc": 1704389737, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yisa0/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_being_a_bad_role/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s one thing to get a vape with your kids present, but asking them what flavor to pick is just bad parenting.\n\nDoes she take them to the liquor store and ask them what kind of alcohol she should buy?", "NTA, you were right and your mom embarrassed herself", "NTA. Her being cross and embarrassed is indication that she knows she did wrong. You were just the one to point it out. I doubt she\u2019ll do it again.", "NTA. You just can't do that. How is she more embarassed from you calling her out over her letting your UNDERAGE siblings choose vape flavors. I'm sorry but she needs help.", "NTA", "i am sorry that between you and your mom, its you who is the adult. you didnt emberass her, her nehaviour did\n\nNTA", "100% NTA.\n\nshe is free to do what she wants when kids aren't around, but asking her children about vape flavors is crossing the line.", "Inform her that judging by the look he was giving her, that she was doing a fine job all on her own. NTA", "NTA- your mother embarrassed herself. You merely pointed out what the store owner was already thinking about her.", "Nta she embarrassed herself and she knows it. She just didn't think anyone would call her out.", "NTA- The store owner was already giving her the stink eye for asking her underage children to help decide on a vape flavor.", "NTA: you\u2019re in your right mind. She did this to herself unfortunately", "NTA. The more embarrassed she was, the better. She should be ASHAMED for engaging her kids over vaping and allowing her 18-year-old to vape. Well the 18-year-old is an adult, but it's such a bad sign.", "NTA - It seems the store owner agreed with you and *she* embarrassed herself. Good on you for not letting your mom poorly influence you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>she\u2019s being a bad role model\n\n100% true and and very sad.", "NTA. Someone should consider calling CPS", "Yta Jesus Christ. She's an adult mind ur freaking own business", "NTA and yikes.", "You hit a nerve because she knows she was in the wrong. Good for you. She needs to step up and be a mother instead of someone who is legitimizing poor behavior to young kids. Your mom is a gateway drug. She sucks!

You shouldn't apologise and you should have stood your ground.", "NTA, the fact that she was \u201cembarrassed\u201d means she knows what you said has validity. Her own actions were the only thing embarrassing her.", "NTA and I'll even add to it by saying I don't think going to the vape store (or to a liquor store for that matter) should be part of a family outing, specially with minors. \n\nPersonally, I think she should have either gone in by herself and asked you or your sister who are of age to stay outside with the younger ones, OR she should have just gone at another time, and if your sister wanted to get a vape too she could join in. \n\nI don't think engaging your children in unhealthy habits, specially in a way that makes the habit seem enticing for them, is an example of being a good parent.", "NTA. The truth hurts sometimes.", "You *absolutely* should have put her on the spot, and you should not have apologized.

When 3 of her 4 kids end up with addiction and health issues, maybe she'll then understand.  Start explaining all the harms that come from vaping to your younger siblings - financial, medical, addiction, stigma (I certainly don't want to hang out with someone who is constantly taking a hit on their vape).  Talk about the whole picture.  Don't hide your discussions from your mother, though keep it factual.", "NTA.  She should have been embarrassed.  Good for you for calling her out.", "NTA, I work in a smoke shop, if a parent came in with a group of kids who were obviously under age and was asking them questions like that I would flat out refuse to sell to them.

Like next time, she goes to get alcohol remind her to bring the girls so they can help her pick the best one. \n\nAlso, don't feel bad for calling out shit behavior. Your mom was only embarrassed because she knew it wasn't appropriate.", "The store owner should have told her to get the fuck out and calld the cops on her.\n\nThis is no different than having a child pick what cigarette brand you buy, or asking for their input in the alcohol you buy and should be treated as such.", "OPs siblings are minors", "And?
