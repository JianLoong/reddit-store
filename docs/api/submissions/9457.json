I had intentions of using it more often but never really did because I got busy with work.\n\nRecently a restaurant, which is part of a restaurant group, reached out to see if I could change my handle to something else because my current one was their old handle and they wanted it back. I playfully told them that for a bottle of wine and a couple apps I could be persuaded to do it since I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll start the project I had in mind with it and they happened to be in my area. They said they would check if that was possible. \n\nToday I got a message saying that I was extorting them. Honestly I was shocked since they were the ones to reach out to me. When I asked for the bottle of wine I was doing so as if you asked a friend to help with a move and they asked for beers in return. I also had all the intention of leaving the amount of money that the wine would have been as a tip. They also said I was going against IG terms of service which in any case they did by soliciting a transfer of my account.

And they\u2019re wrong about Insta\u2019s terms. The rules are that they can\u2019t \u201cpromote\u201d free alcohol. There\u2019s nothing about making an agreement to trade goods. Basically that\u2019s what you\u2019re offering.", "NTA\n\nThis is hilarious. It's your handle. They want you to give it to them for free. You asked for something in exchange. If anyone is violating IG terms (unlikely), it would be them. \n\nFor them to accuse you of extortion is really, really funny. You were perfectly content with what you had and they are the ones who want something from you. It's intimidation and gaslighting for them to now say that you are extorting them. \n\nIgnore them. Let them stew. They need you more than you need them. If you up the ante of what you want in return, fine, but they will likely just use that against you if they can figure a way to do it. So keep screen shots of everything with dates, just in case they try to make a case to IG about this ridiculousness.", "NTA. Instagram handles are like domains, they cost money. It\u2019s not against TOS to buy or sell them. You legally own the account, therefore you legally own the handle. It\u2019s better a bottle of wine and apps rather than a 100-200 dollars (which is what I would have charged since they showed that they wanted it badly). Business is business.", "NTA. Your handle - they are unwilling to do a trade. You need to keep it.", "NTA. People pay for the use of Instagram handles all the time, it\u2019s a simple transaction, not at all extortion. For it to be extortion, there has to be threats involved.", "NTA, you didn't ask for much at all and it's you who'd be inconvenienced by the change. Companies will pay good money to get the handles they want, so by comparison they'd be getting a great deal if you did it for some wine and free food.", "NTA... This is actually a business model for some people. Buy a web domain you think a company would like and hope they'll buy it.\n\nHonestly... Just ask for $... And never eat there", "NTA, and I think this would fall under wanting a certain domain name. Companies will pay a pretty penny to own related domain names and I don't see how this restaurant wanting an IG handle is anything different. You didn't ask for the moon... I'd double my offer personally, haha.", "Extortion definition: the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats.\n\nYou didn't threaten anyone. They're asking you to give them something for nothing in return. They're the cheap asses. Not you. \nNTA", "NTA They want to acquire your handle.\n\nYou must be convinced to part with your handle. A bottle of wine is a nice cheap price, and they should be delighted.\n\nYou are not extorting them. You are responding to their request with terms. If your terms are not acceptable then can choose or acquire a different handle.", "NTA - I am petty, so I would start posting unappetizing food.\n\nedit: spelling", "NTA, they\u2019re just mad you ain\u2019t a fool. Hope you get to enjoy some wine and apps from them soon :)", "NTA. You aren\u2019t extorting them.", "NTA and I'm petty so I'd use the account to post the most random stuff once a week just so it's being used", "NTA. Because I am petty, I would just message them saying, \"shame we can't reach a deal, but hey, keep following\" and start posting in support of their biggest rival. Really put some effort into it.", "NTA. So they named themselves after ur handle or something? May be u shud ask for more", "Lol what? That is in no way extortion. \n\nNTA. \n\nAlso, i would consider it quite rude if I ask someone to help me move and they asked for something in return - though to be fair, I wouldn't even ask someone for help moving in the first place without already planning on providing beer/pizza.", "NTA, although I can't speak to anything involving terms of service I do think they need a dictionary. Unless you left out a major detail about threatening them I don't see where it's extortion.", "NTA. Drop the handle!", "NTA. You have somethign that they want and attach a value you, you requested some form of consideration. This business isnt' your friend or even a place you have any emotional attachment to, youowe them nothing.", "NTA people buy phone numbers in my area (to get an OG area code) ... No one would give that away for free. They want something from you, you asked for something in return. They can say no, it's up to them. I would ignore any contact from them, I would not give them the account after that nasty response!!", "NTA..... also attempt to buy the domain....", "NTA. Looks like they don\u2019t want the handle that badly. I\u2019d keep it.", "NTA Post their message on your IG and laugh your ass off at the replies.", "That was pretty stupid of them. If it were me, I'd sit on that handle forever now lol\n\nNTA", "Love all the advice here. That restaurant really screwed themselves. Hold out for that wine & apps deal. I'd even up the ante after that rude parlay. NTA!!!", "NTA that\u2019s not extortion hahahhahaha", "NTA tell them \u201cExtortion is a criminal act and since you are accusing me of such, all further correspondence must go through an attorney\u201d", "NTA - I think this might be a misunderstanding ... if you are serious about giving the handle back, I would suggest arranging a meeting and saying \"I feel like there is a misunderstanding, can we meet up at your restaurant to discuss\". \n\nIf they refuse, then you can also refuse and post a screenshot of their message to keep the account active. If they do meet and play hardball, you can remind them of their breaching IG's terms of service.\n\nYou have no obligation to return the handle, but you also have to ask yourself if you want to go to war with a restaurant group.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You could have been a great repeat customer. I would keep it out of pettiness if I were you.", "NTA?\n\n> They also said I was going against IG terms of service which in any case they did by soliciting a transfer of my account.\n\nYou're correct. if they are so angry about it being a violation of the ToS, then your answer just changed to \"No\"", "So they aren't willing to comp a few hundred dollars worth of wine and food to get the instagram handle? Fuck em, they don't get the account then lol. That is literally so cheap for what it is. You offered a reasonable offer and they rejected it, sucks for them I guess.", "NTA \n\nYour response should be \u201ccool. Price is now $5,000\u201d. They want your IG tag, now they can pay for it instead of giving someone a free meal. People like that shouldn\u2019t be running a business. Anyone with half a brain would have jumped at that chance. Instead, the person controlling the account chose to insult you. \n\nPlease, tell them you want $5k and see what they say. \ud83d\ude02", "YTA", "Yeah, exactly this", "It is a violation of the TOS, and both would be in violation. \n\n> **You can't sell, license, or purchase** any account or data obtained from us or our Service.\nThis includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer **any aspect of your account (including your username)**; solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.\n\n[Source](https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870)", "It reminds me of that episode of the league when taco bus Dallas cowboys website", "Or enough to pay off the car or house \ud83d\ude06", "Sounds more like a \u201cbribe\u201d than \u201cextortion\u201d", "After they told me I was extorting them and squatting on their old handle I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be visiting them anytime soon.", "Apparently it used to be their old handle before I created that account. For context the handle they want I\u2019ve had it for probably 2 years.", "It could be my mother and if there\u2019s no beer I\u2019m not helping anyone move \ud83e\udd23", "I wouldn\u2019t say I few hundreds, at the most $75 for the wine a some apps and I would have left that amount as the tip. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything TBH but was shocked at their reply.", "Why?", "Yup negotiation!

In this case, OP had something they hadn't intended on selling until they were asked and instead of saying no, named a price. That's it.

They\u2019re trying to negotiate an exchange, but instead of being upfront about it they\u2019re asking for goods and services instead of cash.  The restaurant asked if OP would change their handle - it was a yes or no question.  Not an invitation to try to weasel free stuff from the restaurant.", "Why does it have to be a yes or no response? No one said anything about a favor, that's a trade proposition. OP made an offer after the restaurant made their interest known. Neither party is obligated to do anything.", "Desirable Instagram handles - and website addresses - are very often sold to businesses for a lot of money. OP was being generous frankly by giving it to them for just a bottle of wine. If they really wanted to, they could charge whatever they want for it. (Example: @chanel isn\u2019t owned by chanel and they\u2019ve been trying to get it for years - they have to use @chanelofficial, which is less Desirable and clear to consumers)"]}
