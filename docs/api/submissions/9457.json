I had intentions of using it more often but never really did because I got busy with work.\n\nRecently a restaurant, which is part of a restaurant group, reached out to see if I could change my handle to something else because my current one was their old handle and they wanted it back. I playfully told them that for a bottle of wine and a couple apps I could be persuaded to do it since I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll start the project I had in mind with it and they happened to be in my area. They said they would check if that was possible. \n\nToday I got a message saying that I was extorting them. Honestly I was shocked since they were the ones to reach out to me. When I asked for the bottle of wine I was doing so as if you asked a friend to help with a move and they asked for beers in return. I also had all the intention of leaving the amount of money that the wine would have been as a tip. They also said I was going against IG terms of service which in any case they did by soliciting a transfer of my account. But now I\u2019m thinking AITA?\n\nUpdate: I replied to their message and told them that saying that I was extorting and squatting was very disrespectful. They were the ones who reach out to me first to give up my handle. I also told them that their request was very entitled and that I was kindly rejecting their request.\n\n2nd and final update: They replied saying that I was violating IG TOS and that they were disappointed by my request of \u201cselling\u201d the account for some wine and a bar tab. They also were struggling to understand why I had their old handle (the handle is made up of a very common first and last name and a city) and since I wasn\u2019t using the account frequently they wanted it since it\u2019s the name of their restaurant in other socials. I told them that the handle was available when I registered and that I\u2019m keeping my username. I also made sure to add some posts just to keep the account active. Before I could restrict/block them, they blocked me. Unfortunately for them other variations of the handle are no longer available \ud83d\ude36.", "created_utc": 1675871697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x1xt1/aita_for_asking_for_wine_in_exchange_for_a_favor/", "score": 409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And they\u2019re wrong about Insta\u2019s terms. The rules are that they can\u2019t \u201cpromote\u201d free alcohol. There\u2019s nothing about making an agreement to trade goods. Basically that\u2019s what you\u2019re offering.", "NTA\n\nThis is hilarious. It's your handle. They want you to give it to them for free. You asked for something in exchange. If anyone is violating IG terms (unlikely), it would be them. \n\nFor them to accuse you of extortion is really, really funny. You were perfectly content with what you had and they are the ones who want something from you. It's intimidation and gaslighting for them to now say that you are extorting them. \n\nIgnore them. Let them stew. They need you more than you need them. If you up the ante of what you want in return, fine, but they will likely just use that against you if they can figure a way to do it. So keep screen shots of everything with dates, just in case they try to make a case to IG about this ridiculousness.", "NTA. Instagram handles are like domains, they cost money. It\u2019s not against TOS to buy or sell them. You legally own the account, therefore you legally own the handle. It\u2019s better a bottle of wine and apps rather than a 100-200 dollars (which is what I would have charged since they showed that they wanted it badly). Business is business.", "NTA. Your handle - they are unwilling to do a trade. You need to keep it.", "NTA. People pay for the use of Instagram handles all the time, it\u2019s a simple transaction, not at all extortion. For it to be extortion, there has to be threats involved.", "NTA, you didn't ask for much at all and it's you who'd be inconvenienced by the change. Companies will pay good money to get the handles they want, so by comparison they'd be getting a great deal if you did it for some wine and free food.", "NTA... This is actually a business model for some people. Buy a web domain you think a company would like and hope they'll buy it.\n\nHonestly... Just ask for $... And never eat there", "NTA, and I think this would fall under wanting a certain domain name. Companies will pay a pretty penny to own related domain names and I don't see how this restaurant wanting an IG handle is anything different. You didn't ask for the moon... I'd double my offer personally, haha.", "Extortion definition: the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats.\n\nYou didn't threaten anyone. They're asking you to give them something for nothing in return. They're the cheap asses. Not you. \nNTA", "NTA They want to acquire your handle.\n\nYou must be convinced to part with your handle. A bottle of wine is a nice cheap price, and they should be delighted.\n\nYou are not extorting them. You are responding to their request with terms.

Hope you get to enjoy some wine and apps from them soon :)", "NTA. You aren\u2019t extorting them.", "NTA and I'm petty so I'd use the account to post the most random stuff once a week just so it's being used", "NTA. Because I am petty, I would just message them saying, \"shame we can't reach a deal, but hey, keep following\" and start posting in support of their biggest rival. Really put some effort into it.", "NTA. So they named themselves after ur handle or something? May be u shud ask for more", "Lol what? That is in no way extortion. \n\nNTA. \n\nAlso, i would consider it quite rude if I ask someone to help me move and they asked for something in return - though to be fair, I wouldn't even ask someone for help moving in the first place without already planning on providing beer/pizza.", "NTA, although I can't speak to anything involving terms of service I do think they need a dictionary. Unless you left out a major detail about threatening them I don't see where it's extortion.", "NTA. Drop the handle!", "NTA. You have somethign that they want and attach a value you, you requested some form of consideration. This business isnt' your friend or even a place you have any emotional attachment to, youowe them nothing.", "NTA people buy phone numbers in my area (to get an OG area code) ...

Neither party is obligated to do anything.", "Desirable Instagram handles - and website addresses - are very often sold to businesses for a lot of money.

And kind of a massive over-reaction on their parts.  Was it the alcohol request that got them upset?  I don't know if there are legal issues surrounding gifting alcohol from a restaurant, but even if there were, they could have been more polite about it.  It wasn't as if you were asking for thousands of dollars.  (Or was the wine expensive?)\n\nAnyway, looks like they screwed themselves over.

I mean restaurants give away free appetizers all the time (most restaurants literally have a internal budget set for appetizers they would end up comping for the month) and a mid to cheap bottle of wine they have in stock would cost approximately $50-75, if not less. \n\nI mean there is literally no way someone would give up something for free to a business so they can make more money for themselves. Everything costs something. Right now, their inability to see a very good deal in front of them is costing them your rightfully played pettiness.", "Meh id just post confusing shit to it.

These people are super unprofessional and fools. OP's offer was a steal. IG handles are no different than domain names.

Thanks!", "I paid $5K eighteen years ago for my domain name, and thought it was a steal.  \nOP is NTA.", "They were also acting against ToS, then, as tranaferring the username in any way would be forbidden by that wording.
