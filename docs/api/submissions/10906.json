Growing up Jay was like an uncle to me. He taught me a lot of things about the world and was a huge mentor.\n\nJay has been married to May(F51) for \\~30 years. But around 21 years ago Jay had an affair due to May sterility issues from which an illegitimate child (Kay) was born. Jay and May solved their issues and remained happily married. For 18 years Jay paid child support but other than that wanted absolutely nothing to do with Kay. Yet, 3 years ago when Jay was diagnosed with cancer he tried to contact Kay, but at that point Kay refused. \n\nAlso Jay had a brother who\u2019s got 2 boys. Jay told me personally he never really approved of his SIL but they get along \u2018fine\u2019\u2026\n\nSadly Jay passed away last week. This wasn\u2019t unexpected news because he\u2019s been desperately fighting cancer for the past 3 years. I want to be transparent and admit that I was the one who convinced him to finally get checked and was there every step of the way with him. Used all my connections as a resident to get him the best treatment possible. \n\nA lot of people showed up at the funeral, including Kay and Jay\u2019s AP. It was heartwarming seeing so many people pay their respects, but May wasn\u2019t pleased seeing Kay and the AP there. And after the funeral, as Jay\u2019s executor May told everyone what was in his will:\n\n* 40% of his estate with May\n* 20% to his 2 nephews(16&19)\n* 5% ( certain items & memorabilia) to his friends (my dad included)\n* Rest to me.\n\nThis caused a bit of an outrage with 3 people in particular: Kay, the AP and the SIL.\n\nThe SIL said her nephews should get more. Her eldest and Jay\u2019s brother quickly shut her down though. From what Jay had told me about her she\u2019s the kind of person to go to court over this but his brother seemed reasonable and understanding so hopefully nothing happens.\n\nKay was livid. He went on about how dare Jay exclude him from his will when he couldn\u2019t even bother being a father, etc. He basically went on a tirade criticizing a man at his funeral. He also threatened to sue everyone. At this point everyone got incredibly irritated, because in my country if he sues he is likely to at least get something.\n\nSo I stepped in and made him an offer: I'll give him about 5% in cash right now, and he leaves everyone alone, we don\u2019t see his face ever again. \n\nHis reply was that i can go f\\*ck myself, that I\u2019m an entitled asshole who doesn\u2019t deserve anything from Jay and that he\u2019s gonna sue for everything. \n\nI told him that he is welcome to sue, but if he does I'll try my damndest to make sure he receives nothing and also has to pay for our court fees. \n\nSo that was that at the funeral. I\u2019m waiting for him to sue at this point. \n\nBut the thing is, today while hanging out with my friends i told the story. I thought it would be funny or entertaining. Thing is, a few of my friends disagreed. They called Jay an AH for \u201cabandoning\u201d Jay for 21 years, and me one for fighting for money I don\u2019t need and denying Kay his birthright.", "created_utc": 1677356294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11buksm/aita_for_fighting_to_steal_a_strangers_inheritance/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do realize that through like 85% of his life so far he was a minor and not the one deciding to go no contact from the moment of his birth?", "No jay was the one who didn\u2019t bother all their life", "This is another thing that irked me. I'm not going to disclose the entire sum due to privacy reasons, but I will say that 5% in this context means roughly what an average earner would accumulate in 10-20 years worth of labour.

You got the mentor relationship that should\u2019ve been his. I don\u2019t know why you threw in the bit that the reason Jay stepped out on his wife was because of fertility issues, but that makes him all the more cruel. Infertility is already emotionally and mentally difficult for women, and many women struggling feel like they \u201cfailed\u201d at being a woman. And so Jay instead has an affair? And then Jay punishes Kay for his misdeeds by refusing a relationship with him while at the same time doting fatherly on you? And then Jay only reaches out to Kay when he has cancer and presumably just wants to ease a guilty conscience?\n\nJay is certainly a mega asshole, but you and Kay are not. So.NAH. But some kindness and compassion could go along way here. I\u2019m not saying you have to give him money, although I think a settlement would be a favorable result, rather than a long protracted, legal battle.

He seems awful", ">what i don't understand is what it has to do with me\n\nAre you joking? It very much sounds like you acted like a surrogate son to Jay. You had the relationship that Kay wanted and was denied, and were financially rewarded for that. Can you really not see how that is hurtful to Kay??\n\n>Children, weather legitimate or not are given a lot importance in succession.\n\nInteresting. In that case I wish Kay all the luck in the world in fighting to get the recognition they are owed.", "How did he think of you like a son?

I refuse to be in contact with my shit father but I also have zero plans of going after an inheritance share when he dies lol.\n\nOP NTA", ">You had the relationship that Kay wanted and was denied\n\nThat was until 3 years ago, when the relationship was offered and Kay denied it.", ">3 years ago when Jay was diagnosed with cancer he tried to contact Kay, but at that point Kay refused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Kay wanted a relationship, why did he refuse after Jay reached out? That's Kay's own fault and if he had accepted, maybe he would've got something. It seems like Jay finding out he was dying was a wake up call and was trying to be a better Father, but Kay denied him that chance.", "OP is a direct beneficiary of Jay's shitty behaviour. It's naive to then claim that this has nothing to do with them.\n\n\nI'm glad Kay has some avenues to get that money. They deserve it.", "OP is a beneficiary of their friend\u2019s estate because they were close and he helped him through cancer.\n\nKay doesn\u2019t deserve OP\u2019s money, and OP doesn\u2019t deserve all the shit that\u2019s coming along with it.", ">3 years ago when Jay was diagnosed with cancer he tried to contact Kay, but at that point Kay refused.\n\nis everybody not reading this part?"]}
