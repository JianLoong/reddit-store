Growing up Jay was like an uncle to me. He taught me a lot of things about the world and was a huge mentor.\n\nJay has been married to May(F51) for \\~30 years. But around 21 years ago Jay had an affair due to May sterility issues from which an illegitimate child (Kay) was born. Jay and May solved their issues and remained happily married. For 18 years Jay paid child support but other than that wanted absolutely nothing to do with Kay. Yet, 3 years ago when Jay was diagnosed with cancer he tried to contact Kay, but at that point Kay refused. \n\nAlso Jay had a brother who\u2019s got 2 boys. Jay told me personally he never really approved of his SIL but they get along \u2018fine\u2019\u2026\n\nSadly Jay passed away last week. This wasn\u2019t unexpected news because he\u2019s been desperately fighting cancer for the past 3 years.

It was heartwarming seeing so many people pay their respects, but May wasn\u2019t pleased seeing Kay and the AP there. And after the funeral, as Jay\u2019s executor May told everyone what was in his will:\n\n* 40% of his estate with May\n* 20% to his 2 nephews(16&19)\n* 5% ( certain items & memorabilia) to his friends (my dad included)\n* Rest to me.\n\nThis caused a bit of an outrage with 3 people in particular: Kay, the AP and the SIL.\n\nThe SIL said her nephews should get more. Her eldest and Jay\u2019s brother quickly shut her down though. From what Jay had told me about her she\u2019s the kind of person to go to court over this but his brother seemed reasonable and understanding so hopefully nothing happens.\n\nKay was livid. He went on about how dare Jay exclude him from his will when he couldn\u2019t even bother being a father, etc. He basically went on a tirade criticizing a man at his funeral. He also threatened to sue everyone. At this point everyone got incredibly irritated, because in my country if he sues he is likely to at least get something.\n\nSo I stepped in and made him an offer: I'll give him about 5% in cash right now, and he leaves everyone alone, we don\u2019t see his face ever again. \n\nHis reply was that i can go f\\*ck myself, that I\u2019m an entitled asshole who doesn\u2019t deserve anything from Jay and that he\u2019s gonna sue for everything. \n\nI told him that he is welcome to sue, but if he does I'll try my damndest to make sure he receives nothing and also has to pay for our court fees. \n\nSo that was that at the funeral. I\u2019m waiting for him to sue at this point. \n\nBut the thing is, today while hanging out with my friends i told the story. I thought it would be funny or entertaining. Thing is, a few of my friends disagreed.

Unfucking likely. The only stand up thing for this idiot dead guy could have done was to leave his money to the kid he birthed and then abandoned. But he didn\u2019t.

But later, when they're thinking clearly, they may back down or apologize and handle the situation in a better way.

Jay does not look good, no matter how much OP makes excuses for him.", "Jay made an attempt at reconciling, Kay told him to piss off, which he\u2019s 100% justified to do and I probably would too, but then showing up to try and collect the inheritance when you spat in the outstretched hand is definitely shitty. Jay may have been an absent dad but if he fully paid child support then he wasn\u2019t a deadbeat. Not saying that makes him a good guy and I don\u2019t approve of him not being involved with Kay, but it still wouldn\u2019t sit well with me to see Kay rejecting him reaching out, and then showing up and demanding money now that he\u2019s dead. It also sounds like they showed up at the funeral uninvited, which is lousy in this case.", "Probably that Kay was given an opportunity to have a relationship, and he (understandably) declined.  That means he forfeited any claim to an inheritance.", "Agreed, Jay does not look good here. But we\u2019re speculating on the motivations of a dead stranger here. In fact, few people only have one motive for a choice. It could easily be a combination of both motives:  I feel guilty, I see I was wrong, and I want to fix it so I feel better. \n\nThere is a mix of good and bad in everyone. Few people are true monsters.

From our meetings with him, he didn\u2019t tell her not to contact us because of evil reasons, but because he was afraid it would go badly. And she went against his wishes because she straight up said she couldn\u2019t live with herself if she didn\u2019t. She has previously behaved towards me with very different motives, and I admit, it\u2019s hard for me, because it was so much easier when I could just hate her. I\u2019m going with my real world experience:  people are complicated, and no one wants to be the villain in their own story.", "Yeah, let\u2019s break this down:\n\n1) when he and his wife found out they couldn\u2019t have kids he decided to fuck around. \n\n2) when he got someone pregnant he decided he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the kid so just did the legally required bare minimum. \n\n3) he ignored his kid for over 18 years and only reached out when he was diagnosed with cancer and wanted to ask forgiveness from an 18 year old. An 18 year old who he had abandoned. \n\n4) when the kid rightfully told Jay where to go, Jay decided to do noting else other than stick it to his kid one last time by leaving him nothing. According to you your country has significant protections for children and their inheritance so essentially what Jay did was say that Kay was not his kid. \nJay was not only a flaming AH but deserves to go exactly where his kid probably told him to go. That would be hell. He deserves to go to hell for the trauma he put that boy through and then instead of making it up to him in any way, shape, or form he decided to twist the knife one last time. \n\nAt this point I understand your instinctive reaction. Jay was nice to you. Jay did not give you abandonment issues. Cause you to wonder as a little boy why you weren\u2019t good enough for your daddy to love you.

People can exclude family member, including children, from their wills if they want to.  Someone in my family did that, left everything to one adult child, and nothing to the rest.  It sucks for Kay but they may not have any claim to it if the will was solid, and Jay did pay child support for 18 years.", "So I'm curious if Jay is on Kay's birth certificate.

That funeral was full of people who the father chose over him, including people who he treated like sons. And that family couldn't see Kay and be sorry for Kay's pain, no, they didn't want him there.

But all in all, I'd get solid legal advice and settle the estate fairly rather than fighting for years and having lawyer fees eat it up instead.

Welcome to today\u2019s edition of \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d.\n\nAnd since you think the topic of adoption is some sort of gotcha, a lot adoptees do consider adoption a primal wound they work hard to make peace with, and that often deals with situations where the biological parents did not have the resources (often due to crushing poverty) to care for their child.
