Growing up Jay was like an uncle to me. He taught me a lot of things about the world and was a huge mentor.\n\nJay has been married to May(F51) for \\~30 years. But around 21 years ago Jay had an affair due to May sterility issues from which an illegitimate child (Kay) was born. Jay and May solved their issues and remained happily married. For 18 years Jay paid child support but other than that wanted absolutely nothing to do with Kay. Yet, 3 years ago when Jay was diagnosed with cancer he tried to contact Kay, but at that point Kay refused. \n\nAlso Jay had a brother who\u2019s got 2 boys. Jay told me personally he never really approved of his SIL but they get along \u2018fine\u2019\u2026\n\nSadly Jay passed away last week. This wasn\u2019t unexpected news because he\u2019s been desperately fighting cancer for the past 3 years.

It was heartwarming seeing so many people pay their respects, but May wasn\u2019t pleased seeing Kay and the AP there. And after the funeral, as Jay\u2019s executor May told everyone what was in his will:\n\n* 40% of his estate with May\n* 20% to his 2 nephews(16&19)\n* 5% ( certain items & memorabilia) to his friends (my dad included)\n* Rest to me.\n\nThis caused a bit of an outrage with 3 people in particular: Kay, the AP and the SIL.\n\nThe SIL said her nephews should get more. Her eldest and Jay\u2019s brother quickly shut her down though. From what Jay had told me about her she\u2019s the kind of person to go to court over this but his brother seemed reasonable and understanding so hopefully nothing happens.\n\nKay was livid. He went on about how dare Jay exclude him from his will when he couldn\u2019t even bother being a father, etc. He basically went on a tirade criticizing a man at his funeral. He also threatened to sue everyone. At this point everyone got incredibly irritated, because in my country if he sues he is likely to at least get something.\n\nSo I stepped in and made him an offer: I'll give him about 5% in cash right now, and he leaves everyone alone, we don\u2019t see his face ever again. \n\nHis reply was that i can go f\\*ck myself, that I\u2019m an entitled asshole who doesn\u2019t deserve anything from Jay and that he\u2019s gonna sue for everything. \n\nI told him that he is welcome to sue, but if he does I'll try my damndest to make sure he receives nothing and also has to pay for our court fees. \n\nSo that was that at the funeral. I\u2019m waiting for him to sue at this point. \n\nBut the thing is, today while hanging out with my friends i told the story. I thought it would be funny or entertaining. Thing is, a few of my friends disagreed.

Unfucking likely. The only stand up thing for this idiot dead guy could have done was to leave his money to the kid he birthed and then abandoned. But he didn\u2019t.

But later, when they're thinking clearly, they may back down or apologize and handle the situation in a better way.

They didn't have a relationship, regardless of whose fault it was, and you and he did. He left money with the people who meant the most to him. It's just unfortunate that he didn't set it up better to avoid challenges, but what are ya gonna do? I suggest seeing a good lawyer in advance so as to get ahead of all of this, you aren't in the wrong here, nobody should be entitled to something just due to the circumstances of their birth.", "NTA.

Did he ever try again? Or did he assuage whatever conscience he had with that one attempt?\n\nJay is the asshole. But among the living, reluctantly, NAH, except you have no standing whatsoever to be a dick to Kay or about his mother (21 years later, she's no longer the  \"affair partner.\") And you're a little too puffed up about the idea of making this 21-year-old pay your court fees, too.", "A will is what the person wants to happen to their estate.

Sorting out an estate is a long, drawn-out and complicated process. And this doesn't sound like a simple estate to administer. Also, will readings aren't a real thing. They might happen occasionally but they're not standard, not expected and not recommended by legal professionals.", "Simple, you got the surrogate father he never had as well as a fuck ton of cash and he got nothing and was obviously quite distressed about it. Hope he sees some money as I know people who have bad fathers step out of their lives.", "Kay sees that inherence as the compensation for the lack of father he had.  It is for his pain and suffering. I'm not saying he's right to think that way but you see it constantly here with people complaining about getting written out of wills by someone who abused them and they avoided until that party died. \n\nThey see you as withholding that compensation and helping the \"asshole\" who fucked them over, fuck them over one more time.", "It\u2019s also pretty dicey, that he knew Kay absolutely had a legal right and then tried to con him out of money by lowballing him.", "You'd offer her the money but you wouldn't let his actual son have it.

What will change if he takes his money? Will it change the fact that he never had a relationship with his father? Will it make his \"anger\" go away? Is it a final act of \"punishing\" Jay and everyone else who was on good terms with Jay? \n\nKay and Jay, although biologically linked, were and are strangers. Kay is fighting for a stranger's money because he wants the money. \n\nIf you despise someone for his actions, why go after his money? He is nothing to you, but his money is something to you?

OP could defuse all of this just by listening and validating.", "What?!", "OP is a direct beneficiary of the time he spent with Jay", "Yep, I agree and probably wouldn\u2019t have responded either. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t anticipate that this would lead to exclusion from the will, which is also understandable (if certainly not praiseworthy) if Jay fully paid child support for his childhood, and the olive branch was rejected in adulthood.", "Maybe he wanted to assuage his guilt. I think it is also possible than facing his own mortality made Jay reassess his priorities, and made him realize that not having a relationship with Kay was a mistake. I look for the positive reason, because thinking the ugly reason is only reason gets so depressing.", "You\u2019re asking an awful lot of OP, someone who did nothing wrong. Lemme lay out the scenario:\n\nOP has just lost his \u201cuncle\u201d who he loved very much, after a years long battle with cancer that OP was there every step of the way for, supporting and helping his uncle. His uncle has just died, he\u2019s grieving, the  whole family is grieving hard, and it\u2019s time to read the will. After it\u2019s announced that Kay has inherited nothing, he becomes irate (understandably), hurling verbal abuse at everyone there (less understandably), WHO ARE ALL GRIEVING and have nothing to do with Kay, his relationship with Jay, or the will allotment. Since he turned down speaking with Jay three years ago, Kay clearly does not want to be heard, he just wants money (understandably). OP, after listening to Kay hurl vitriol at himself and his whole grieving family, OP offers Kay some of his own inheritance, that he COMPLETELY deserves since he was Jay\u2019s caretaker through cancer, if he\u2019ll stop screaming at his distraught family and leave them alone to freaking grieve. That is not \u201csucks to be you, I got mine,\u201d that\u2019s \u201cno one here had anything to do with this, take the money you want and stop screaming at us.\u201d \n\nYou want some empathy for Kay? How about Kay have a little empathy for a family that just lost a beloved family member who had nothing to do with your situation? To be nasty to OP\u2019s mom is completely uncalled for. Yeah, Jay may suck for refusing to be a present dad and just pay child support, but Kay became the asshole when he decided to scream and yell at a bunch of grieving people who had nothing to do with and no say in why he\u2019s upset.", "Hmm, Kay deserved a father who actually gave a shit about him when he was growing up. Instead he got an asshole dad.\n\nI'd say Kay deserves the money for the shitty childhood he had, it will help pay for the therapy he needs.", "You mean the guy that never wanted anything to do with him in the first place? Yeah don\u2019t blame him LMFAO", ">But you don't get to be resentful over not having a relationship that you refused to have years prior.\n\nLol, this is just wrong. Of course you can be resentful over your father abandoning you. Him reaching out one single time your entire life does not suddenly absolve him of a lifetime of neglect. Jesus Christ.", "Well unfortunately reality is a depressing place. Jay does not look good, no matter how much OP makes excuses for him.", "Jay made an attempt at reconciling, Kay told him to piss off, which he\u2019s 100% justified to do and I probably would too, but then showing up to try and collect the inheritance when you spat in the outstretched hand is definitely shitty. Jay may have been an absent dad but if he fully paid child support then he wasn\u2019t a deadbeat. Not saying that makes him a good guy and I don\u2019t approve of him not being involved with Kay, but it still wouldn\u2019t sit well with me to see Kay rejecting him reaching out, and then showing up and demanding money now that he\u2019s dead. It also sounds like they showed up at the funeral uninvited, which is lousy in this case.", "Probably that Kay was given an opportunity to have a relationship, and he (understandably) declined.  That means he forfeited any claim to an inheritance.", "Agreed, Jay does not look good here. But we\u2019re speculating on the motivations of a dead stranger here. In fact, few people only have one motive for a choice. It could easily be a combination of both motives:  I feel guilty, I see I was wrong, and I want to fix it so I feel better. \n\nThere is a mix of good and bad in everyone. Few people are true monsters. It is not impossible, but it is improbable, and I think a healthy discussion accounts for more scenarios than just the extreme.", "He was given that 'opportunity ' when the father was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Typical and convenient. I would have declined too.", "He didn't fofeit all claims to the inheritance, he's fighting for it.", "Ok then, keep making excuses for a deadbeat. \ud83e\udd23", "What they meant was when Jay tried to reach out, Kay rejected him. So obviously when you have no relationship with somebody, you can't expect to receive a cut of their money", "Well, I\u2019m looking at this as the daughter of a deadbeat, who is now dying as a result of his alcoholism, and forbade his wife from reaching out to my sister and me. She did go ahead and reach out anyway.  I\u2019ve seen him, gotten to say goodbye, and am grateful for the opportunity. From our meetings with him, he didn\u2019t tell her not to contact us because of evil reasons, but because he was afraid it would go badly. And she went against his wishes because she straight up said she couldn\u2019t live with herself if she didn\u2019t. She has previously behaved towards me with very different motives, and I admit, it\u2019s hard for me, because it was so much easier when I could just hate her. I\u2019m going with my real world experience:  people are complicated, and no one wants to be the villain in their own story.", "Yeah, let\u2019s break this down:\n\n1) when he and his wife found out they couldn\u2019t have kids he decided to fuck around. \n\n2) when he got someone pregnant he decided he didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the kid so just did the legally required bare minimum. \n\n3) he ignored his kid for over 18 years and only reached out when he was diagnosed with cancer and wanted to ask forgiveness from an 18 year old. An 18 year old who he had abandoned. \n\n4) when the kid rightfully told Jay where to go, Jay decided to do noting else other than stick it to his kid one last time by leaving him nothing. According to you your country has significant protections for children and their inheritance so essentially what Jay did was say that Kay was not his kid. \nJay was not only a flaming AH but deserves to go exactly where his kid probably told him to go. That would be hell. He deserves to go to hell for the trauma he put that boy through and then instead of making it up to him in any way, shape, or form he decided to twist the knife one last time. \n\nAt this point I understand your instinctive reaction. Jay was nice to you. Jay did not give you abandonment issues. Cause you to wonder as a little boy why you weren\u2019t good enough for your daddy to love you. So you are not the AH for Jay being the AH but you would be the AH if you do what you threatened to do and help Jay hurt his kid one last time.", "YTA. You think it is funny that that terrible parent hurt is child again. I hope Kay has people in his life that make up for his terrible father.", "This is morally and, it sounds like, legally (in your country), Kay\u2019s birthright. YTA.", "Jay is the AH here, abandoning their kid like that.  However, I guess depending where this is, does Kay have any legal rights to the money?  People can exclude family member, including children, from their wills if they want to.  Someone in my family did that, left everything to one adult child, and nothing to the rest.  It sucks for Kay but they may not have any claim to it if the will was solid, and Jay did pay child support for 18 years.", "So I'm curious if Jay is on Kay's birth certificate. Makes a big difference if you are not in the U.S. Also, if you do go to court I would make it clear Jay tried reaching out 3 years ago and Kay wanted nothing to do with him etc. Show that Kay just wants a payday to be honest.", "ESH Jay was a shitty father and it was shitty to leave his kid nothing but it sounds like that was the kind of person he was", "NTA if it was giving to you it's yours", "INFO\n\n> Kay was livid. He went on about... \n\nWait.\n\nYou chose \"Kay\" for the name of a *man* in this story?\n\nI mean, it's immaterial to the story, but you know that's a traditionally female name, right? Why would you intentionally introduce ambiguity like that?", "NTA.  You offered a complete stranger money on the spot. Not any fault of the rest of you that he was not named in the will.  Jay did reach out 3 years prior and Kay said no, killing any chance of meeting.  Have to wonder how much of the non-involvement was in May\u2019s side.", "Nta", "NAH. \n\nLet this be a lesson to readers that of you have an immediate relative who you don\u2019t want to receive anything in a will, leave them $1. Otherwise in many countries they can claim the deceased was coerced by the other family to be omitted in the will and may win a portion of the estate.", "op=NTA\n\nYou were the one there for his last days, which likely why he put you in the will.  And no one is OWED a birthright in this day and age.    \nI do think Jay was an A H to Kay but Kay was fine being an A-H back when Jay did reach out. That was between them.  Jay wrote his will how he wanted it to be dispersed.  His choice.", "The rest is 35%. NTA,  you didnt write the will. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA here except SIL, SIL IS THE ASSHOLE! \n\nTwenty percent is fine for her children!\n\nIf Kay would inherit it all, it would not make up for the years lost without a father, those days are long gone and you can miss what you never had but sadly, money and material items do not bring happiness. A split as you suggested is nice of you as you aren\u2019t shifting into SIL mode over things but again, money or items will not be the bandaid Kay thinks it will be.\n\nJay possibly latched onto you because of May\u2019s fertility issues and later because of the situation with Kay, that\u2019s not entirely a wrong thing. He didn\u2019t have Kay at home so you were it for him. \n\nSister in law is obviously extremely greedy, \n\nThe splitting amongst friends seems fair and okay, in passing we don\u2019t get to take our money and collections with us.", "Couple issues with your judgement:  \n\n1 - it's all well and good to be given money by someone, but OP clearly states that Kay likely is entitled per the laws of their country. OP crossed the line the first time by trying to cheat Kay out of whatever Kay could receive with the 5% but shut up forever deal. Then threatened to fight him in court for forever. OP not only is defending Jay's AH behaviour but doing so after his friend is dead and is willing to go to court to defend his friends AH behaviour  \n\n2 - OP THINKS THIS IS FUNNY. OP seriously told this incredibly heartbreaking story to his friends, thinking that they would laugh about an abandoned child's heartbreak and anger. That's why this came to AITA in the first place. Because he thinks Kay's pain is fucking funny   \n\nthat makes OP squarely the AH himself. he's picked up the mantle of Jay's assholishness and is willing to fight for Jay's assholishness. and then on top of that, he finds this situation funny\n\nKay was rejecting by his father his entire life. His father reached out once and only once - when his father was ill and finally wanted something from Kay. And then even in death, rejected his son again. Was rejected in front of an entire family of people who should have been his family but aren't because his father rejected him. That funeral was full of people who the father chose over him, including people who he treated like sons. And that family couldn't see Kay and be sorry for Kay's pain, no, they didn't want him there. Not for anything Kay did, but because of what Jay did. So not only abandoned by his father, but punished by what should have been his friends and family because of his father's sins\n\nand OP not only treated Kay like shit on the bottom of his shoe, but also somehow finds Kay's anger over this funny\n\nYTA OP, majorly", "It has everything to do with you the moment you decide to fight against Kay. \n\nMost people would either be neutral as in \"whatever the court decides. I'm not fighting either way\" or would go the extra step of making sure they cooperate to ensure the courts have a full and complete picture of the situation (which will help Kay's case). \n\nMay decided to stay with her shitty husband on the condition that he abandon his kid. She's just as guilty as him.", "What it has to do with you is that you are helping Jay hurt Kay one last time. By leaving Kay out of the will he essentially said that Kay wasn\u2019t his son. \n\nJay was a selfish AH that didn\u2019t think about anyone other than himself and what he wanted so he hurt a lot of people along the way. And instead of trying to make it up to Kay in his will because that\u2019s the only kind of a \u201cfather\u201d he ever was, he just said \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t forgive me for abandoning you for 18 years until I decided I wanted something from you so fuck you\u201d. \n\nI really really hope hell is real and Jay ends up rotting there.", "I think you're going to lose this fight. If children legally have a right to an inheritance, Jay needed to take whatever steps were needed to disinherit them. If that's not possible, then he needed to leave them whatever was legally necessary or the will is probably at least partially invalid. \n\nI don't think you're TA but I don't think you're being realistic. I think you **should** get part of what he left you since you nursed him through the end of his life but should and will are not the same.", "You offer money to her but not the abandoned son. You\u2019re a piece of work.", "Why don\u2019t you keep 5% and give him 35, then?", "This depends entirely on jurisdiction.  In some parts of the world he wouldn't be entitled to anything, in some parts he would be entitled to a set percentage that's written in the law, and in some (including where I live) he'd be entitled to something, but figuring out what that something is can be very difficult to determine/agree on.  The laws in this area vary wildly across the globe.", "Idk. OP has been remarkably cold here. I think if he does what he said he\u2019s going to do he would absolutely be an AH for helping Jay hurt Kay one last time.", "What amends? Jay offered to be in contact and Kay has declined, possibly because Jay avoided all the hard parts of having a child and now wanted to be comforted as he succumbed to cancer. Jay reached out to ask Kay for contact, ask for a relationship, possibly asking Kay for his time to care for Jay, he wasn't offering a brass razoo.", "OP chose to involve himself when Kay expressed anger at the will, and offered to buy off Jay's only child with a pittance. Apparently in OP's country that won't fly.\n\nI'll trust that OP knows more about his country's inheritance laws than the random \"Kay is owed nothing\" commenters (there are places where the estate would be primarily divided between the spouse and actual children), so this \"take 5% and get tf out\" offer may have been very unfair in that jurisdiction, and it would be an interaction OP started. \n\nNow, I do think OP is NTA. But all in all, I'd get solid legal advice and settle the estate fairly rather than fighting for years and having lawyer fees eat it up instead. If offspring matters greatly for inheritance as OP said, and Kay is the only offspring dude had, he's probably getting a decent chunk of his father's estate.", "Oh, so you\u2019ve met my ex, have you?", "Was he supposed to just overcome being abandoned because his sperm donor got cancer?", "You absolutely can be resentful if that person is a deadbeat dad lmao"]}
