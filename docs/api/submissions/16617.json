We spent months practicing and perfecting the routine, and we were really excited to show it off at our wedding.\n\nHowever, when the big day arrived, things didn't go as planned. Many of our guests were uncomfortable with the idea of dancing in front of other people, and some even refused to participate. We were really disappointed and upset that our guests weren't willing to join in on the fun.\n\nTo make matters worse, we decided to make it mandatory for our guests to participate in the dance. We thought that this would encourage everyone to join in and have a good time, but it ended up causing a lot of tension and discomfort.\n\nNow, some of our guests are saying that we were being selfish and unreasonable for forcing them to do something that made them uncomfortable. They're also saying that it was inappropriate to make something mandatory at a wedding, and that we should have respected people's boundaries.\n\nWe're still upset that our guests didn't participate in the dance, but we're starting to realize that we may have been in the wrong for forcing them to do so. So, Reddit, AITA for forcing our wedding guests to participate in a weird and uncomfortable dance?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
