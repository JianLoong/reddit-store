She sounds exhausting.", "NTA, any bets the husband is frantically trying to fix this because he can't stand her being home now? Sounds like the only time she brings joy to a room is when she leaves it.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t treat you that way, and you should call her out on her criticism and rudeness. If you reconcile, set boundaries moving forward.\n\nWhat you said was the truth, and what you asked of her is reasonable. Sounds like she needs you more than you need her. Maybe she is depressed or still grieving from her parents\u2019 death. She sounds lonely, perhaps unhappy, and you are the only family she has left, apart from her husband and kids. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that at 38, she already considers the best years of her life older. Your 30s should be when financial stability, maturity, and youth intersect and peak. If she already feels like her best years are behind her at 38 with two young kids, it will only go downhill for her.", "NTA.  She turned up uninvited, you could have been out, sick etc.\n\nThis is on her not respecting normal boundaries that most people don't need to be told.", "NTA. It sounds like your childhood shaped you to be independent and protective. I'm kind of amazed that you allowed her level of intrusiveness for any length of time. I hope that if you do decide to reengage with her that you decide what boundaries you'll need to set first.", "You're NTA. It is deeply concerning that she flipped out this hard because you were asleep and didn't answer the door when she turned up unannounced.\n\nAlso some of your quirks sound like mine, I am Autistic. Have you thought about looking into neurodiversity? It wouldn't change my answer though whether you are Autistic or not - you should be able to live how you want in your space that you pay for.", "NTA. She keeps hanging around to abuse you out of what - desperate need for family to nag? Is this how she treated your parents, before they died? Is that why she needs you as a target, now? Is her husband so frantic because he knows that she'll spew this bile on him if he can't line up another target for her wrath?", "NTA\n\nShe became that unhinged because you didn't answer the door. That's not normal. The only reason I could think is that she may have been afraid that something happened to you and now she had no family left. But still she needs therapy not off loading all of that onto you.\n\nYou deserve your peace. I would not allow her back in my home. We'd have to meet at the park, or a restaurant, or some other public place.", "OP, have you ever investigated whether you are neurodiverse? Your interests and dislikes suggest that perhaps you are. If it\u2019s true, this could also suggest why there are lifelong differences and difficulties between you and your family, it is common neurotypical people might feel they have to \u201ctry hard\u201d to accommodate anyone different.\n\nI only suggest because it could be a way to have a conversation that the way you live isn\u2019t about you making supposed \u201cbad decisions\u201d (like your sister might think) but because it is very much who you are. The dim light, the way you eat, the way you respond to your needs over social expectation - could all be explained in a way that you\u2019re not trying to hurt or annoy her.\n\nI personally don\u2019t think either of you are assholes, but are deeply different people - and that can be reconciled with conversations about understanding each other.\n\nETA: it sounds like you do an excellent job of holding boundaries and get on just fine on your own. But a relationship with your sister (if you can both make the time to understand each other) could *add* to your life.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds intolerable. Be thankful she's not talking to you.\n\nI'd block her and her husband as well.", "NTA, you've been more than patient. Your sister enjoys being in your face and all up in your business, way too often, and at random intervals -- but you're not enjoying it one bit. And the 32 messages and escalating drama are just...just... beyond unacceptable.\n\nIf and only if your sister HERSELF calls and gives you a real apology, go to that meeting and choose specific days during the month (like \"every second Monday evening\") when you're willing to entertain her and her family. Advise that the rest of the month, your door will be locked and your phone will be off, effective immediately.\n\nYou know that if you don't protect your \"me time\" from this attention harpy, you won't have any. Guard it, OP!!\n\nNTA", "NTA.  It seems like your sister only comes over to criticize you.  You told her right, there is no need for her to visit if she can only bring negativity.\n\nI'm glad you were able to get your degree and be successful.  Don't let other people put you down to make themselves feel better.", "NTA. She's resentful of something, her marriage, her kids, her husband, her life. Something in her life is missing and she's jealous of you, most likely because it sounds like your life is simpler. You're self-sufficient and don't need her but I bet she's thinking, omg what if I die, who will take care of the kids...etc. That's why she's trying to force you to bond with them. Her husband and her most likely have issues.\n\nThe \"best years of her life\" have gone by, so that means that right now, it's the worst days of her life. She longs to go back to her youth and resents aging and the responsibilities of being a wife/mother....etc. It sounds like you don't have kids, another thing to envy you for besides you being younger. And how dare you, the one who got kicked out and was the black sheep, make HER, the golden child, jealous?!", "NTA but what was it that your parents decided to \"forgive and forget\"?", "Why are you still trying? Your parents are gone .. Let her be like that too. Don't waste your time with her. Go NC. Move on. Nta.", "nta. She has no right to come around unannounced. She also has no right to tell you how to live your life, you're a full grown adult, not her little sister anymore. I'd block her # and her husband's. Keep your peaceful life.", "Nta, your sister was being horribly controlling and invasive", "Honestly?  Nah.  She is dealing with her grief her way.  Too pushy but whatever.  Fair enough to have her back off and set boundaries.  It takes a while to renegotiate sibling relationships left in the past.  You have to learn who each other are.  \n\nI would say your sister is the ah if anyone.  But I think she is just upset and doesn't know how to relate to you and she has been trying.  \n\nLow light drives me crazy, family wearing noise canceling headphones drives me crazy, odd food habits drive me crazy, but I put up with all of it with a smile because I love my family.
