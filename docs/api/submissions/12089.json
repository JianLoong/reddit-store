You are supposed to be a role model and a good example. Not feed, bathe and change diapers every day. \n\nHonestly, I don't know what kind of relationship they expect you have with your little brothers being 18 years apart.

And I get the feeling they're doing so because you're 'only girls' and they wanted sons.\n\nThey should not have children when they can't parent them. \n\nI get your sister, but her anger is misdirected. It's your parents fault she gets abused that way, her youth is stolen from her by your parents, and whenever she brings that up you should gently point her in the right direction. Remind her that this is your parents choice, not yours, and as much as you love her, she can't expect you to sacrifice your life for her and to speak up against your parents who force her to parent your brothers, not you. Otherwise you should show some willingness to help her when it's her time to move out, but you're 18 and she can't demand you stay behind just because your parents suck.\n\nAnd they definitely do. What they're doing is unfair. They're ruining your life. Those are their kids, and you're just their kid too. And they've failed you and your sister big time. Whenever someone troes to guilt trip you you should throw that right into their faces.\n\nYes it's ok to expect children to take on a share of household responsibilities. And yes it's fair to ask them to babysit occasionally. But what is happening here is not reasonable. They're stealing your youth so they can have more babies. This is parentification.
