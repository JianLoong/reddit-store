Communication is very important.", "NTA I was made to watch my baby sister all the time as well. I was 15yo when she was born, so I was the built in babysitter. My mom and I got into some big fights, because there were times when she'd make me hold my baby sister and tell me that she was leaving and would be back later. \"Later\" always meant after the bars closed. The last straw was one morning she woke me up to babysit. I told her no, that's your baby and you can take her with you. She slapped me across the face and I ran upstairs and grabbed a utensil out of the knife block. I didn't intend to use it, but I was SO sick and tired of her hitting me. She backed off after that and ended up leaving with my baby sister. I began running away soon after that.\nOP my advice to you is;\n1. Make sure you finish high school! Try to go to community college, so you're not stuck in a crappy job and have to live with a bunch of roommates the majority of your life.\n2. Try to rent at least a 2 bedroom even if it's a dump. You and two other friends living in a 1 bedroom will go ok for awhile, but then you'll resent the friend who has the bedroom. The two of you who live in the living room will have a hard time bringing guests over and you'll have no privacy. \nAt least with two bedrooms two of you can have your own room and one of you lives in the living room(you all would have more privacy) or two of you split one room and the other has his own room. Either way it goes, whoever ends up with a room of their own should pay a little more\n3. Work really hard!\n4. Do NOT allow your parents to guilt you to come over and babysit. If they try to and don't give up you'll need to go low contact or no contact with them.\n5. Stay in contact with your sister. Invite her over often even if she can't go. Let her know that you'll always be there for her and as soon as she's able to, you'll help her move out too. Talk to her about getting a part time job, so she can start saving money now.\nLastly, make sure you have all your important documents(birth certificate, social security card, passport, etc.) If you haven't already done so go to the bank and open a checking account and savings account, so you have somewhere safe to put your money. Once your sister gets a job add her to your savings account, so she can deposit money into the account. Doing all this will keep your parents from being able to access you and your sisters money. \nGood luck OP and please update us in a few months.\n\nEdited: changed being a part time job to getting a part time job.", "NTA!
