The last straw was one morning she woke me up to babysit. I told her no, that's your baby and you can take her with you. She slapped me across the face and I ran upstairs and grabbed a utensil out of the knife block. I didn't intend to use it, but I was SO sick and tired of her hitting me. She backed off after that and ended up leaving with my baby sister. I began running away soon after that.\nOP my advice to you is;\n1. Make sure you finish high school! Try to go to community college, so you're not stuck in a crappy job and have to live with a bunch of roommates the majority of your life.\n2. Try to rent at least a 2 bedroom even if it's a dump. You and two other friends living in a 1 bedroom will go ok for awhile, but then you'll resent the friend who has the bedroom. The two of you who live in the living room will have a hard time bringing guests over and you'll have no privacy. \nAt least with two bedrooms two of you can have your own room and one of you lives in the living room(you all would have more privacy) or two of you split one room and the other has his own room. Either way it goes, whoever ends up with a room of their own should pay a little more\n3. Work really hard!\n4. Do NOT allow your parents to guilt you to come over and babysit. If they try to and don't give up you'll need to go low contact or no contact with them.\n5. Stay in contact with your sister. Invite her over often even if she can't go. Let her know that you'll always be there for her and as soon as she's able to, you'll help her move out too. Talk to her about getting a part time job, so she can start saving money now.\nLastly, make sure you have all your important documents(birth certificate, social security card, passport, etc.) If you haven't already done so go to the bank and open a checking account and savings account, so you have somewhere safe to put your money. Once your sister gets a job add her to your savings account, so she can deposit money into the account. Doing all this will keep your parents from being able to access you and your sisters money. \nGood luck OP and please update us in a few months.\n\nEdited: changed being a part time job to getting a part time job.", "NTA!

It\u2019s not fair to you or your sibling, but that COULD be the reason why.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right, but at least it\u2019s an understandable reason for having you babysit.", "Agreed. Nta parentification is considered illegal and abusive for a reason.

The kids made no decisions regarding if their parents had these kids or not, yet the older siblings have become the parents aside from financial responsibility.

There are so many ways the parents can deal with childcare without dumping it on their older kids. In one family I know, the dad works days and the mom works nights so one of them is always home. Or what about extended family, or hiring a \"mother's helper\" for a few hours after school? OP is NTA, and he and his sister are being abused.", "They could have not had the kids.\n\nIt's not a child's responsibility to watch their sibling.\n\nOP is NTA, but you certainly are.", "In this case, it sounds like full on parentification rather than the occasional helping out.", "This.

Even if the situation was mildly better before, why the 4th child?\n\nMost likely, the parents will refuse to discuss anything, as in their minds the teenagers' roles in the family are cemented: \"the kids contribute to the household by babysitting\". For them all is well if it's the teenage children whose needs get trampled.\n\nThe only way they will look hard and thoughtfully at their family and choices is if OP leaves.

How is she supposed to do that?", "Problem is OP's sister is 16, as mentioned in the post.", "What would you expect them to do? Take the kids away? That would be way more traumatic for everyone involved.", "CPS? You can't actually be serious can you because that is the most ridiculous suggestion I have heard in awhile. I suggest you do some research into what actual child abuse and severe situations CPS is involved in. Because this doesn't even remotely qualify, believe it or not older siblings watching their younger siblings a couple hours after school is extremely common. It's called being a family", "Link?", "I'm so sorry. I hope you and your sister are both in better places now.", "Yes! Sister can speak to a therapist (if she has one), a school guidance counselor or even if the situation is desperate enough CPS. She's not the one who is legally obligated to care for her siblings and if she's consistently put in a position where she has no choice, there are steps she can take to force her parents hands in the matter. If she makes plans outside the home (specifically like an extracurricular activity through the school or a part time job) and informs the parents that starting on xyz day, she will no longer have the time or flexibility to be the exclusive childcare provider, if they still leave the kids there she could report them for abandoning their young children. Just a simple phone call to the non emergency police line saying \"our parents left my siblings alone at home with me despite knowing that I have to leave at xyz time. I'm obligated to show up to xyz thing and they won't come home to be with their kids or arrange alternative childcare and I can't just leave them alone. What do I do?\" And in that scenario, the police will most likely contact CPS themselves and CPS will make the parents come up with an alternative solution. Being forced to parent an infant and a toddler isn't in the best interest of the 16yo and CPS would definitely put pressure on mom and dad to provide actual childcare. If they can't afford it, there are state assistance programs to cover some (or all) of the cost. They have no excuse. OP, NTA. Please be gentle with your sister. She's not mad at YOU so much as your parents and the circumstance. Good luck", "The cops will not physically touch you to drag you back home either. If she left, and was patient enough, the cops can\u2019t do dick shit.", "Yeah and back then it was also tradition for the daughter to move out at 16 and get married but that doesn't happen anymore either.

They have financial incentives to investigate and put families in the system.", "There is a lot of steps before taking the kids.", "That depends on where OP lives. In my country this would be a reason to investigate the family and the parents would be told to make changes.\n\n(Copied from a earlier respons)", "Given she is 16, there is a risk that could happen.

And parents can\u2019t kick her out either, she\u2019s 16; and frankly there is zero indication that they would. If they work that many hours they can afford a few more hours of daycare. They can afford an afternoon/evening nanny who will pick them up from their regular daycare. This is the parents problem to fix, OPs sister absolutely can force them to fix their own childcare problem. Of course the easiest way for the sister is to tell all this to another family member or friend. Tell them the average hours per week, not just \u201ca couple hours after school \u201c. Try to find someone who will house sister for just 1-3 mo. That will force the parents to find other childcare or for one of them yo reduce their hours. Then sister will have leverage to negotiate her return. Help her out OP, you know how trapped you felt at 16 and you had your sisters help back then with brother. She\u2019s all alone.", "Like what?", "Not necessarily I live in Texas and my sister (we have different dads and live with our own individual dads our mom wasn\u2019t all that active in our lives) went to her councilor saying she was severely depressed to the point of not caring about her life and that she couldn\u2019t be with her dad anymore and that same day CPS was notified and she was taken to our moms they do take mental health into account a lot more than you think it doesn\u2019t always have to be insane extremes", "There is a difference between helping out and raising their siblings cause mum and dad can't be bothered to use a daycare or nanny.", "This is the way! she can visit her sibling and join every single after school activity possible!!

I am furious with the parents in this situation and I think that the way they are treating their older children is despicable, and it will have long-term negative effects on their relationships with those kids and on those kids' futures.
