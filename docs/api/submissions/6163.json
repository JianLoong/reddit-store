{"id": 6163, "submission_id": "100bem5", "title": "AITA for opening Instagram message requests?", "selftext": "**edit at the bottom**\n\nThis all started like 3-4 days ago. I (19F) opened a message request and it had a dick pic in it. I immediately blocked the person and told my bf (20M). I told him exactly what I just told you - I opened a message request that had a dick pic and I blocked that person as soon as I saw it. I don't know who the person was, I assumed just some sick fuck assaulting my dms so he could get off. \n\nBf got pissed at me. He blamed me for it then narrowed it down to being my fault because I opened it. I explained *again* that I wasn't talking to the person, don't know who it was, and they were blocked. They weren't even a follower of mine, it was literally a random person. Eventually, we dropped it but it got brought up again today because of a different conversation. \n\nWe're arguing again because I don't see how receiving an unsolicited dick pic is ever **my** fault. He still stands by his original point. He's now saying I'll be in \"deep shit\" with him if it happens again. I tried to argue the point that I literally do not know what is in a message request until I open it and had I known, he would've been blocked before he was. Like at the very least, it's sexual harassment. \n\nI can understand not opening them and I'd understand if I was the AH for not respecting his boundary on this but I haven't opened any on any social media platform. I just don't get it. AITA?\n\n**ETA: this piece of our chat, copied word for word**\n\n\nBf: Just decide now which is more important open request or keeping me\u00a0\n\n\nMe: You're really saying you're going to break up with me if I open message requests?\n\n\nBf: No im not but this is stupid just stop opening the dam requests already fuck\u00a0\n\n\nBf: Im sick of it so sick of it you want to fight me on the message request all the time just stop opening them that\u2019s final\u00a0\n\n\nBf: Im so done with all the fighting im so close to snapping off like stop with the shit just stop it\u2019s would be amazing if you\u2019d stop opening any messages from anyone or any requests at all im not kidding im so done with it\u00a0\n\n\nMe: Okay\n\nThen he started talking about his truck door that he was working on. Has been since.\n\n**ETA #2: he said this to me like 5 minutes ago. Copied and pasted.**\n\nBF: I\u2019m sorry you got harassed but you can\u2019t even apologize for looking at a dick that isn\u2019t FUCKING MINE \n\nThat's his reasoning.", "created_utc": 1672545746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100bem5/aita_for_opening_instagram_message_requests/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
