{"id": 23204, "submission_id": "15aglag", "title": "AITA for unfolding my clothes because my wife accidentally folded them the wrong way?", "selftext": "My wife (29F) and I (31M) have been married for 5 years and have 3 kids that are 3, 2, and almost 2 months old. I work, and she stays home to take care of the kids. She is a great wife and mom and I love her. Whenever she does laundry, she rolls and puts my clothes on hangers  and I put them away. \n\nYesterday when I got home from work she handed me my basket of clothes, but instead of them being rolled, they were folded. I asked why, and she said she just forgot and did them like everyone else\u2019s. I said that was fine and I went in our room and unfolded the clothes and laid them on the bed, planning on rolling them back up. However I realized I didn\u2019t have the time because I had to work on a presentation, so I went to my office and started working.\n\nMy wife came in awhile after that and asked why I had unfolded my clothes. I said because I wanted them to be rolled and was going to do it but realized I needed to finish some work. I asked her if she could please re-roll them, and she just walked out. She came back with a basket of all my clothes and just dumped them on the ground in my office and called me an AH and told me to do it myself.\n\nI think that it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable request because she takes care of things around the house and I\u2019ve had the same preference for my laundry for our entire marriage. I work hard to provide her and our children with a very privileged life and I don\u2019t think properly rolled laundry is asking for that much. I did plan on doing it myself but just couldn\u2019t. Now she is giving me the cold shoulder.\n\nAm I the AH?", "created_utc": 1690402825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15aglag/aita_for_unfolding_my_clothes_because_my_wife/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s a stay at home mom to three extremely tiny kids, you should be doing your own goddamned laundry as it is. She stays home to take care of the children, not you.

I washed, dried, folded and put his clothes on the top of the dresser for him to put away. He said I folded his underwear wrong - his mom always folded it this way and that's how he wanted it folded. That boyfriend is now my husband of 32 years and he has done his own laundry since that fateful day. At least his underwear is always folded how he likes it. YTA.", "YTA. First, I have never heard of \"rolling\" laundry, but that is beside the point. Okay, she folded it. Maybe she forgot, maybe something else was going on. But when you take the items, dump them on the bed, and then walk away, asking her later to roll them again, YTA. That completely reads like you're trying to punish her for not doing it \"your way\". \n\nWow. Had you just said you were going to roll it when you finished work the outcome would have been much different.", "YTA.   You had two choices--either unfold and re-roll your clothing immediately, or deal with them folded.  Instead, you unfolded them, undoing the work she had done.  You left them laying on the bed, making a mess and keeping her from using the bed as well as displaying your disdain for the work she had done for you.  Then you still have enough audacity left to ask her to re-roll them for you.\n\nShe was right to refuse to do it, and if I were her, I'd stop doing your laundry entirely until you figured out that anything done on top of keeping your three tiny children alive for the day deserves copious amounts of gratitude.", ">I did plan on doing it myself but just couldn\u2019t.\n\nShe doesn't believe that, and honestly neither do I. You were unhappy she forgot your special little preferences, you told her it was fine, and then unfolded all of the clothes and left them until she came around and asked why, and then you asked her to re-roll them. It sounds more like you're getting back at her for not doing it \"right\" in the first place than any intent at all to just handle it yourself. YTA.", "If you unrolled it, then that is now your task. You two are partners, you don\u2019t employ her, so kindly walk back that \u201cI work hard for her\u2026\u201d she has value in what she provides for the home as well (maybe take some time to Google articles and familiarize yourself with what those contributions are thanks to the partners that stay at home). For the love of Pete do not use the \u201cI bring home the bacon\u2026\u201d line as a fallback reason that she should re-fold your clothes, that she already folded. No one wins that game. Who knows maybe she\u2019d prefer y\u2019all to have less money if that meant she could work outside the home and you had to do all the laundry? If you both truly have an agreement in how your roles are divided, cool. Maybe she had other things lined up after she finished the laundry: dishes, needed to run errands, getting kids lunch or a nap, maybe she was due for her only break in the day (everyone deserves breaks). So you asking her to refold your clothes, thereby undoing her already done work, was not ideal or in her plans. It\u2019s ok to prefer your clothes to be rolled or hung up or whatever. There\u2019s many tactful/respectful ways to go about that conversation. Asking her to refold is where you messed up, and that \u201cbreadwinner\u201d mentality is what\u2019s gonna keep you in hot water. Empathy and acknowledgement for what she does for you and your family will go far. (YTA)", "YTA. You want a maid, hire one. She is your partner and already took care of the clothes once.", "YTA \n\nYou just couldn't be happy with the way your clothes were folded this ONE TIME? This woman more than likely has a lot on her plate throughout the day with taking care of your kids and keeping your house in order. Dawg, she's working just as hard as you are, acting like she doesn't provide for the family just because it's not financial. You could have just left them as they were or never asked her to roll them, but you chose to ask her to refold laundry she had already done. Buddy, def need to get your head out your ass and learn to not be so privileged esp when it comes to the woman taking care of your home and raising your children.", "Of course YTA. It would have been different if you'd just rerolled them but you didn't. You treated her like a subordinate that you were punishing by doing a job over \"until she got it right\".

She is not your mother, she is the mother of your children and the savings on childcare alone for those kids alone makes your magnanimity of being the \u2018breadwinner\u2019 seem pretty hollow. Now do the costings for the rest of her UNPAID LABOUR: chef, housekeeper, laundress, cleaner\u2026and apologise or leave- she will appreciate only raising the children she\u2019s birthed for a change.", "YTA.\n\nYou wanting to roll them and doing it yourself? Perfectly acceptable.\n\nYou asking your wife to put in the extra time and effort to redo a task she already did? Perfectly abhorrent.\n\nYour wife does the laundry for everyone. She made one \u201cmistake\u201d because she was on autopilot while trying to keep up with all the household needs. \n\nDo you expect her to make you redo every mistake you make?

Unfolding them and rolling them is okay.\n\nYou should not have left them unfolded on the bed\\* but let's say that's okay again.\n\nHowever, asking your wife to roll your clothes after **you undid her work** and not understanding that she is pissed makes you the asshole. You should apologize for undoing her work and **asking her to do it again**. Moreover you should participate in laundry instead of asking her to do everything.\n\nYou should not expect your wife to do your laundry a particular way if she does it for 5 people and you do not help. That is only kind of her to do it your way, not something you should expect.\n\nIt looks like you feel superior because you are the one that brings money and you can disrespect her work because her work is less important.

You should support her and not demean her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* because she can't use the bed and feels pressured to roll them herself. Maybe it was your intention?

Pretty amazing you somehow remembered that you had a presentation, after you undid her hard work.  So you left the clothes for you wife to find.  That's rude behavior.

You undoing what she had done, then walking away from it because \u201cyou realized you had work to do\u201d it sounds suspicious as hell to me.  What it looks like to me, and probably to your wife, you had a little tantrum, undid her work, walked away and locked yourself in your office with a \u201cthat\u2019ll teach her attitude\u201d.  If that\u2019s your way of conditioning or controlling her with things in life then you are absolutely a complete a-hole and you\u2019ll be a miserable and lonely forever.

And then you had no time at all to do this thing you said you didn't mind doing and dumped the work back on your wide. I don't know if you are lying to us or lying to yourself but this is a passive aggressive statement and nothing else.  I hope she makes you do your own laundry from now on.", "YTA- how rude. how ungrateful and undeserving of the hard work she does that allows you to make the money you make. how disappointing it is to see you do not consider she significantly more contributions she makes to your household than you. You go home and clock out, she does not.", "Yta. She has 3 kids to take care of full time, it's a really hard work, you should do more at home, more than 50% of chores. My husband is lucky if I fold his laundry and I have only one kid full time home...", "YTA - your wife did a perfectly acceptable job of doing the laundry. If it wasn't to your liking, fixing it yourself was a pedantic but acceptable option. But creating extra work for your stay-at-home mom who *definitely* has better things to do than roll your laundry was indeed an asshole move. \n\nDo you think her life's passion is laundry and making you happy?", "YTA. She did do your laundry. Its not her fault it wasnt up to your standards. Myself, i wouldnt have reacted the way she did, i would have just pushed them to your side of the bed...

I'm just appreciative he's willing to wash and dry and fold my clothes at all, it's a huge help to me.\n\nYour wife is taking care of 3 kids -- including a brand new infant. She's doing A LOT. You undid her work, then asked her to essentially do it again. Look, dude, just do your own re-folding.\n\nAlso yes you provide money etc for the family. Your wife created 3 humans, including a teeny-tiny one that's ruining her sleep, and likely does the lion's share of all the household chores, emotional labor etc. Unrolling her hard work (she's doing laundry for FIVE PEOPLE MY GOD) and leaving it there is ridiculous, you know it.

Get your OCD in check and apologize to your wife.", "YTA - Plenty of people work full time jobs and also do their own laundry. You should consider this if the way your wife does it isn't good enough for you. She may be a stay at home mom but it's not her job to do EVERYTHING at the house. You need to do somethings too. It's too much having 3 kids and doing all the cleaning and laundry. That would have her working 24/7. Even people with a full time job have down time. Nanny's who work full time don't do all the cleaning and laundry. They only do what's necessary for the children. You are not a child.

I asked why, and she said she just forgot and did them like everyone else\u2019s.

I said because I wanted them to be rolled and was going to do it but realized I needed to finish some work. I asked her if she could please re-roll them, and she just walked out. She came back with a basket of all my clothes and just dumped them on the ground in my office and called me an AH and told me to do it myself.\n\nI think that it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable request because she takes care of things around the house and I\u2019ve had the same preference for my laundry for our entire marriage.

The moment you asked her to do it again was where the grave was finished", "YTA\nYou could have left them folded. \n\nBut instead you unfolded everything, then wanted your wife to redo it. Dude. Yes. You're unreasonable. You're lucky she didn't thrown them outside.", "YTA How much are you paying for these services because ain't no way.", "YTA and what a pretty little creature you are..... Your wife has a massive work load with so many children and household chores. You could have folded your clothes again immediately after unfolding them.", "I re-fold clothes that aren\u2019t folded the way I like\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Hell, I\u2019ll rearrange the dishwasher! But you\u2019re kinda the AH for making her roll them for you.", "YTA!  What fucking difference does it make.  They are clothes & not a Katana the Smith is folding the steel.", "YTA.  You say you suddenly realized you had to go work on something and \"didn't have the time.\" Please. You seriously didn't have 5 to 10 minutes? That's all the longer one basket of clothes takes, no matter how you do the clothes. You could probably make them into swans.", "I think she\u2019s feeling tired and very unappreciated. I suggest you roll your own clothes if you need them a specific way.", "YTA for asking her to do it again. I\u2019m a stay-at-home wife who does most (not always all) of the laundry. My husband was taught to fold a certain way, and I was taught another. I usually remember to fold his clothes his way so they\u2019ll match what he\u2019s already folded, but because my way is much faster I default to it when I have a million other things to do. Guess what? He doesn\u2019t give a crap. The clothes are clean, folded, and put away neatly in his closet. There are things to worry about that are actually important, and it seems like both of you are exhausted. Why waste precious energy worrying about this?", "YTA if you can\u2019t actually refold them, leave them alone until you can. Don\u2019t leave a mess on the bed.", "Quick question. Did you ground her? Take away her driving privileges? Or maybe no dessert? \n\nYTA for not realizing that maybe your wife was having an overwhelming day and instead of saying \u201chey I\u2019m sorry I left them there. I\u2019ll roll them when I wrap up here. Why don\u2019t you go get some coffee alone and I\u2019ll hang with the kids\u201d you treated her like your personal servant.", "You don't get to ask someone for a favor and then complain about how they do it. You REALLY don't get to undo what they've done and then demand they do it all over again.  I call BS on the \"I just got really busy and couldn't do it myself\" thing--you chose to unfold them at a time when you couldn't hang them up simply for the express purpose of punishing her.  If you had the time to unfold all the laundry and lay it flat on the bed you *had the time to put it all away instead.*  YTA", "Of all the things going on in the world at the moment this is the one thing the OP chooses to get his knickers in a twist about.\n\nRoll your own goddamned laundry, dude. YTA.", "I am deeply suspicious about the fact that the exact moment he realized he had more work to do was when he had laid them all out but hadn't started rolling them.  You think it would be easier to just take the folded clothes and roll each one rather than lay them all out and then roll them.", "He had too make damn sure she knew she was losing all of stars on her yelp review. /s", "Right, that line about how he works hard rubs me the wrong way. \n\nOP, YTA.", "It's worse than no communication because when she asked he just asked her to do it. I'm pretty sure he never actually intended to roll it himself.", "I (husband) do the laundry and all it\u2019s related bits. If I fuck something up my wife will let me know and I fix it.\n\nOP is TA with the half-assed bit, but not for expecting it getting fixed.", "Literally LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLed at this. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "This is so wrong. \n\nOP never says the wife is the only one that does laundry. \n\nEven if she were the only one, as long as there is balance in the rest of the house, there\u2019s nothing wrong. \n\nShe\u2019s responsible for taking care of the kids and her husband. He\u2019s responsible for taking care of his wife and the kids. What\u2019s with this idea that Husband and Wife aren\u2019 supposed to take care of each other? That\u2019s not a marriage that\u2019s just roommates.", "Yeah, my ex complained that I hadn't ironed his underwear. Hence ex...", "It's even weirder than that. He didn't \"take the items [and] dump them on the bed.\" He unfolded each item and laid them all out to be rolled. Then he suddenly had work to do, not a meeting or call but paperwork (that somehow he hadn't been aware of until then?). Then told his wife to refold his laundry. Yikes!", "OP probably feels like hes being generous hes not giving her the honeymooner treatment for disobeying him", "It\u2019s a great packing hack", "Instead of rolling, you can also fold into small sections, and it makes for great drawer organization, you can see everything and easily pull a shirt, pants, etc. out. I fold all my clothes this way and it makes seeing everything + putting everything back in a known \"place\" SO much easier/faster.", "You should try it! I roll up everything I don't hang; I can fit way more in a drawer this way, and I can identify individual T-shirts from above, which isn't possible with a stack of folded ones. This probably works best if your wardrobe is primarily T-shirt-like.", "Yes. She\u2019s a stay at home mom. Not a stay at home wife. She likely works more hours than he does. And she doesn\u2019t tell him how to do his job so he should have no say over the laundry. If he doesn\u2019t like it he can learn how to use the machine", "Right... I would honestly be curious if the cost savings of the wife's labor + childcare for 3 kids in OP's city is actually more than OP's salary. In many circumstances like this, it often draws VERY close to even.", "Guess OP is not exhausted.\n\nWorking all day as well......", "he never intended to roll them himself.", "I would never harm her. I love her. She is gorgeous and bright and the kindest person I know normally. I know that I\u2019m lucky to have her. These comments have helped me to see I\u2019ve been a dick. But please don\u2019t imply that I want to harm her or that I ever would", "He would still BTA for asking her to redo them at all. She's not his maid.", "So when she washes his car and misses a spot, he should throw mud on it and tell her to do it again?   Or forgets salt on his steak...he should dump it in the trash and tell her to restart dinner?  That's basically what you're saying...that his OCD trumps her forgetfulness.  Bull.  He is the one being emotionally manipulative and needs to put that into check.", "And what does the wife do to make OP feel appreciated for his hard work?\n\nOr is it acceptable for OP to feel underappreciated by the wife?", "Yep, I'm in total agreement.  This man is either spoiled enough to be used to her fulfilling his every whim, or he's completely manipulative and intended to have this outcome.  Either way, I doubt she ever gets to say no.", "Hard disagree. OP is TA 100% \n\nThe laundry was folded perfectly fine, and with 3 kids, his wife has plenty of better things to do than to refold them bc he's being picky. This isn't about quality of work, the laundry wasn't incompetently done, it's about preferences. It's the equivalent of \"make me another sandwich because this one is cut rectangle instead of triangle.\"\"\n\nAlso, it seems very manipulative to undo the folding claiming he intended to redo it himself and then behave as if it's unreasonable to ask her to redo it for him. Im guessing OP planned her to redo it the whole time.", "\u2018I think that it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable request because *she takes care of things around the house* and I\u2019ve had the same preference for my laundry our entire marriage\u2019. He doesn\u2019t do laundry. He sees \u2018taking care of things around the house\u2019 as her domain, which is fundamentally unbalanced with three kids that age.", "I fold it into packets.", "And things don't get as wrinkled...  It really works when packing a bag for traveling because you can fit more with less wrinkles\ud83d\udc4d", "OP works 8-10 hours a day. Mom is on for at least 18 (more with an infant waking through the night and OP doesn't sound like the type who takes his turn parenting the kids). She doesn't get breaks and if he works an office job, trust me, he gets lots of downtime.", "Your coworkers hopefully don't ask you to wipe their butts, throw up on you and have extremely loud tantrums several times a day?", "Oh I know I grew up with men like him. I\u2019m quite glad to have a competent husband.", "The line\n\n \u201cI work hard to provide her and our children with a very privileged life and I don\u2019t think properly rolled laundry is asking for that much\u201d \n\nScreams that he was never going to do it and he basically expected her to redo them when she found them laying out. That\u2019s why he is so shocked.", "The folded clothes which are not supposed to be folded? \n\nNope. \n\nIf there are dress slacks, shirts, blazers, etc made of materials which are not supposed to be folded, it would be inconsiderate and could be costly if they were folded. He would have every right to ask her to redo them.", "She does FUCKING EVERYTHING", "Cleaning, childcare, cooking, home maintenance, appointment making. She's on 24/7 and you don't think HE's appreciated enough? Christ.", "How do you know how many hours he works per day?\n\nHow do you know his commuting time?\n\nAlso he just got home from his 8 to 10 hour work day (according to your estimation) and is now working on a presentation for work.\n\nSo his work day, apparently, does not end when he gets home after 8 to 10 hours??\n\nIf Mom is organized and efficient she can have some down time, not all people are capable of of such time management.", "Nope, but that is part of the SAHP job.\n\nIf the Mom cannot take it, then get a different job and hire a nanny and housekeeper.\n\nI doubt if the hired help did not do their job up to wife's standards or felt underappreciated, I doubt she would be so understanding................", ">He would have every right to ask her to redo them.\n\nWith three kids under three?  Nah.   He needs to hang it himself and be grateful she didn't put dish detergent in the washing machine and put his shirts in the oven instead of the dryer.     \n\n\nThey have a two-month-old baby.  Admittedly I had a c-section, but I still wasn't doing laundry two months postpartum.   This dude who 'works hard' needs to spend a few days doing his wife's job and then see how he feels about thinking it's ok to ask her to redo a chore she already did once.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd he brings in ALL the money to pay ALL the expenses.\n\nSheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh.....................", "I doubt she doesn't not eat, sleep, bathe, visit with her friends, play on her phone or computer, just like her husband.\n\nHubby came home from work and is still working.
