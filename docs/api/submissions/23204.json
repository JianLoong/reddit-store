{"id": 23204, "submission_id": "15aglag", "title": "AITA for unfolding my clothes because my wife accidentally folded them the wrong way?", "selftext": "My wife (29F) and I (31M) have been married for 5 years and have 3 kids that are 3, 2, and almost 2 months old. I work, and she stays home to take care of the kids. She is a great wife and mom and I love her. Whenever she does laundry, she rolls and puts my clothes on hangers  and I put them away. \n\nYesterday when I got home from work she handed me my basket of clothes, but instead of them being rolled, they were folded. I asked why, and she said she just forgot and did them like everyone else\u2019s. I said that was fine and I went in our room and unfolded the clothes and laid them on the bed, planning on rolling them back up. However I realized I didn\u2019t have the time because I had to work on a presentation, so I went to my office and started working.\n\nMy wife came in awhile after that and asked why I had unfolded my clothes. I said because I wanted them to be rolled and was going to do it but realized I needed to finish some work. I asked her if she could please re-roll them, and she just walked out. She came back with a basket of all my clothes and just dumped them on the ground in my office and called me an AH and told me to do it myself.\n\nI think that it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable request because she takes care of things around the house and I\u2019ve had the same preference for my laundry for our entire marriage. I work hard to provide her and our children with a very privileged life and I don\u2019t think properly rolled laundry is asking for that much. I did plan on doing it myself but just couldn\u2019t. Now she is giving me the cold shoulder.\n\nAm I the AH?", "created_utc": 1690402825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15aglag/aita_for_unfolding_my_clothes_because_my_wife/", "score": 2289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s a stay at home mom to three extremely tiny kids, you should be doing your own goddamned laundry as it is. She stays home to take care of the children, not you.

I washed, dried, folded and put his clothes on the top of the dresser for him to put away. He said I folded his underwear wrong - his mom always folded it this way and that's how he wanted it folded. That boyfriend is now my husband of 32 years and he has done his own laundry since that fateful day. At least his underwear is always folded how he likes it. YTA.", "YTA. First, I have never heard of \"rolling\" laundry, but that is beside the point. Okay, she folded it. Maybe she forgot, maybe something else was going on. But when you take the items, dump them on the bed, and then walk away, asking her later to roll them again, YTA. That completely reads like you're trying to punish her for not doing it \"your way\". \n\nWow. Had you just said you were going to roll it when you finished work the outcome would have been much different.\n\nETA: I have heard of rolling clothes for packing. But that is not the issue here.", "YTA.   You had two choices--either unfold and re-roll your clothing immediately, or deal with them folded.  Instead, you unfolded them, undoing the work she had done.  You left them laying on the bed, making a mess and keeping her from using the bed as well as displaying your disdain for the work she had done for you.  Then you still have enough audacity left to ask her to re-roll them for you.\n\nShe was right to refuse to do it, and if I were her, I'd stop doing your laundry entirely until you figured out that anything done on top of keeping your three tiny children alive for the day deserves copious amounts of gratitude.", ">I did plan on doing it myself but just couldn\u2019t.\n\nShe doesn't believe that, and honestly neither do I. You were unhappy she forgot your special little preferences, you told her it was fine, and then unfolded all of the clothes and left them until she came around and asked why, and then you asked her to re-roll them. It sounds more like you're getting back at her for not doing it \"right\" in the first place than any intent at all to just handle it yourself. YTA.", "If you unrolled it, then that is now your task. You two are partners, you don\u2019t employ her, so kindly walk back that \u201cI work hard for her\u2026\u201d she has value in what she provides for the home as well (maybe take some time to Google articles and familiarize yourself with what those contributions are thanks to the partners that stay at home). For the love of Pete do not use the \u201cI bring home the bacon\u2026\u201d line as a fallback reason that she should re-fold your clothes, that she already folded. No one wins that game. Who knows maybe she\u2019d prefer y\u2019all to have less money if that meant she could work outside the home and you had to do all the laundry? If you both truly have an agreement in how your roles are divided, cool. Maybe she had other things lined up after she finished the laundry: dishes, needed to run errands, getting kids lunch or a nap, maybe she was due for her only break in the day (everyone deserves breaks). So you asking her to refold your clothes, thereby undoing her already done work, was not ideal or in her plans. It\u2019s ok to prefer your clothes to be rolled or hung up or whatever. There\u2019s many tactful/respectful ways to go about that conversation. Asking her to refold is where you messed up, and that \u201cbreadwinner\u201d mentality is what\u2019s gonna keep you in hot water. Empathy and acknowledgement for what she does for you and your family will go far. (YTA)", "YTA. You want a maid, hire one. She is your partner and already took care of the clothes once.", "YTA \n\nYou just couldn't be happy with the way your clothes were folded this ONE TIME? This woman more than likely has a lot on her plate throughout the day with taking care of your kids and keeping your house in order. Dawg, she's working just as hard as you are, acting like she doesn't provide for the family just because it's not financial. You could have just left them as they were or never asked her to roll them, but you chose to ask her to refold laundry she had already done. Buddy, def need to get your head out your ass and learn to not be so privileged esp when it comes to the woman taking care of your home and raising your children.", "Of course YTA. It would have been different if you'd just rerolled them but you didn't. You treated her like a subordinate that you were punishing by doing a job over \"until she got it right\". She may be a SAHM but that doesn't make her your servant.", "YTA. You sound like you were being pretty precious, about something that, ultimately, does not matter one way or another (although FYI, rolled items do fit better in a suitcase should OP\u2019s wife ever feel so inclined to reduce her UNPAID workload by 25% and throw you out)\n\nSeriously, you earn the dollars, she keeps the roof over your head a home AND wrangles two toddlers and a newborn- and she did the other adult\u2019s laundry, cleaned, dried, folded and delivered to OP\u2019s room. She is not your mother, she is the mother of your children and the savings on childcare alone for those kids alone makes your magnanimity of being the \u2018breadwinner\u2019 seem pretty hollow. Now do the costings for the rest of her UNPAID LABOUR: chef, housekeeper, laundress, cleaner\u2026and apologise or leave- she will appreciate only raising the children she\u2019s birthed for a change.", "YTA.\n\nYou wanting to roll them and doing it yourself? Perfectly acceptable.\n\nYou asking your wife to put in the extra time and effort to redo a task she already did? Perfectly abhorrent.\n\nYour wife does the laundry for everyone. She made one \u201cmistake\u201d because she was on autopilot while trying to keep up with all the household needs. \n\nDo you expect her to make you redo every mistake you make?

Unfolding them and rolling them is okay.\n\nYou should not have left them unfolded on the bed\\* but let's say that's okay again.\n\nHowever, asking your wife to roll your clothes after **you undid her work** and not understanding that she is pissed makes you the asshole. You should apologize for undoing her work and **asking her to do it again**. Moreover you should participate in laundry instead of asking her to do everything.\n\nYou should not expect your wife to do your laundry a particular way if she does it for 5 people and you do not help. That is only kind of her to do it your way, not something you should expect.\n\nIt looks like you feel superior because you are the one that brings money and you can disrespect her work because her work is less important. It is not. There are 3 kids and a 2 months one! You know what some people says about stay-at-home moms. She knows too. You should support her and not demean her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* because she can't use the bed and feels pressured to roll them herself. Maybe it was your intention?

So what she folded them. She washed them. Dried them. Then folded them instead of rolling them.  Then after her efforts you  dumped them.  Pretty amazing you somehow remembered that you had a presentation, after you undid her hard work.  So you left the clothes for you wife to find.  That's rude behavior.  It sounds like she normally rolls them. Did you ever think maybe she has something on her mind.   I'd guess that you will be getting your clothes in a pile from now on.", "YTA.  You undoing what she had done, then walking away from it because \u201cyou realized you had work to do\u201d it sounds suspicious as hell to me.  What it looks like to me, and probably to your wife, you had a little tantrum, undid her work, walked away and locked yourself in your office with a \u201cthat\u2019ll teach her attitude\u201d.  If that\u2019s your way of conditioning or controlling her with things in life then you are absolutely a complete a-hole and you\u2019ll be a miserable and lonely forever.

And then you had no time at all to do this thing you said you didn't mind doing and dumped the work back on your wide. I don't know if you are lying to us or lying to yourself but this is a passive aggressive statement and nothing else.  I hope she makes you do your own laundry from now on.", "YTA- how rude. how ungrateful and undeserving of the hard work she does that allows you to make the money you make. how disappointing it is to see you do not consider she significantly more contributions she makes to your household than you. You go home and clock out, she does not.", "Yta. She has 3 kids to take care of full time, it's a really hard work, you should do more at home, more than 50% of chores. My husband is lucky if I fold his laundry and I have only one kid full time home...", "YTA - your wife did a perfectly acceptable job of doing the laundry. If it wasn't to your liking, fixing it yourself was a pedantic but acceptable option. But creating extra work for your stay-at-home mom who *definitely* has better things to do than roll your laundry was indeed an asshole move. \n\nDo you think her life's passion is laundry and making you happy?", "YTA. She did do your laundry. Its not her fault it wasnt up to your standards. Myself, i wouldnt have reacted the way she did, i would have just pushed them to your side of the bed...

I'm just appreciative he's willing to wash and dry and fold my clothes at all, it's a huge help to me.\n\nYour wife is taking care of 3 kids -- including a brand new infant. She's doing A LOT. You undid her work, then asked her to essentially do it again. Look, dude, just do your own re-folding.\n\nAlso yes you provide money etc for the family. Your wife created 3 humans, including a teeny-tiny one that's ruining her sleep, and likely does the lion's share of all the household chores, emotional labor etc. Unrolling her hard work (she's doing laundry for FIVE PEOPLE MY GOD) and leaving it there is ridiculous, you know it.

Get your OCD in check and apologize to your wife.", "YTA - Plenty of people work full time jobs and also do their own laundry. You should consider this if the way your wife does it isn't good enough for you. She may be a stay at home mom but it's not her job to do EVERYTHING at the house. You need to do somethings too. It's too much having 3 kids and doing all the cleaning and laundry. That would have her working 24/7. Even people with a full time job have down time. Nanny's who work full time don't do all the cleaning and laundry. They only do what's necessary for the children. You are not a child.

I asked why, and she said she just forgot and did them like everyone else\u2019s.

I said because I wanted them to be rolled and was going to do it but realized I needed to finish some work. I asked her if she could please re-roll them, and she just walked out. She came back with a basket of all my clothes and just dumped them on the ground in my office and called me an AH and told me to do it myself.\n\nI think that it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable request because she takes care of things around the house and I\u2019ve had the same preference for my laundry for our entire marriage.
