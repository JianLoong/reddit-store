A few nights ago, I went to a community festival with my friend, also 24f. Following a fun night of roller coasters and pig racing contests, we decided to get some shitty fair food before leaving, deep fried oreos to be precise. While we were waiting for our food, we hear screaming. People around us start fleeing and screaming that there's someone with a gun shooting people, we see some cops sprinting in the direction of the commotion. I freeze in my spot until my friend grabs me and we start running. A young mother tripped and fell with her toddler in the chaos, I sprinted right around her, I'll never forgive myself for not stopping to help her. \nMy friend and I hid between some food trucks until the coast seemed clear, then booked it to the car and spent about an hour in traffic frantically trying to escape the very congested parking lot. I was so scared for my friend and myself, I can still hear the pounding in my ears, I don't know if l've ever been more frightened. I thought I had just survived a mass shooting, turns out it was a false alarm and that some idiot had just flashed his piece during a fight. I did not find this out until an article was published late yesterday regarding the incident on my local news site. \nAfter a very emotional car ride and dropping my friend off at home, I texted two people, my mom and my boyfriend. I texted them that there was a mass shooting and the festival, that I was informing them of this because I didn't want them to see it in the news and panic, that I was home and safe, and that I loved them. My mom was very concerned and I spent the next half hour on the phone soothing her. My boyfriend, however, read the message and did not reply. I waited the whole night for him to text me back, thinking he was maybe concerned and trying to compose himself or that he was on the way over to see me or something. \nHe did not text me until noon the next day, and simply said hello. I let him know that I was upset he didn't show more concern. He insisted that because I didn't actually get hurt that it didn't matter and that I was being dramatic for attention.\nI'm furious but he insists that it's not a big deal because I'm fine. Yesterday, when the article came out, he again insisted that because nothing actually happened that I'm being dramatic for attention. I'd be sick if something like this happened to him, even if it did turn out to be a false alarm.

It sort of sounds like the news story came out AFTER her first talk with her bf?  \n\nI mean -- I think she would probably know it wasn't an actual mass shooting by the following morning. If it HAD been, it would have been all over every local news channel starting first thing in the morning. I can't imagine going through that, and then not getting up and IMMEDIATELY checking the news to find out the latest.   \n\n(In fact, yeah, I've kind of gone through it, including experiencing how little you actually know while it's actively going on. And then being glued to TV reporting for basically the rest of the day, and all the next day, and hell, basically the rest of the week.  But that was being down near the bombing at the Boston Marathon, with my brother running that year.  We weren't on the course, we were a block south in the family waiting area, and in the aftermath we didn't even actually know it had been bombs, or where.  We didn't get a full picture of it until we'd met up with him and then walked back to his hotel and turned on the coverage.  So I'm just saying -- I totally get how confusing it is in the moment, and how it takes time to find out what exactly happened. But if you go through it, how can you not turn to the news first thing, to find out what actually happened?)\n\nAnd yeah,  his whole \"well obviously you weren't hurt, so it's no big deal\" thing is like, the nadir of emotional intelligence.", "The text read \u201chey, there was a shooting at the festival, im fine and home, i didn\u2019t want you to hear about it and get concerned, i love you\u201d. but i feel like if i got a text like that from him i\u2019d be very concerned", "Yes, looking back it's clear no one was in danger. But in the moment, it would be frightening. In the moment she THOUGHT they needed help and feels bad for not helping. In the moment she THOUGHT she was in danger. And there's a massive difference between 'unharmed' and 'fine', it's still a traumatic event.\n\nWith the number of daily mass shootings in America it could well have been a legit threat. The point is, would even a simple \"I'm glad you're safe\" be too much for him? It at least gives the appearance that he doesn't care. Yes, she's not hurt but still clearly shaken by it, is a little comfort too much to ask? The bare minimum of empathy?\n\nI teach people to drive. I had someone pull out in front of one of my learners and she almost hit them. She got quite a scare and was a little shaken. Did I tell her to stop being dramatic since she didn't actually crash? No, because I'm not a fucking monster. I got her pulled in to the side and helped calm her down and reassure her.", "the exact text read \"hey, there was a shooting at the festival, im fine and home, i didn't want you to hear about it and get concerned, i love you\" but i see your point, i guess with everything on the news my mind jumped to the worst case scenario", "> If it was a mass shooting it would have been in the news instantly, and your family would have checked that. \n\nNot late at night they wouldn't.  She said she and her friend went to the festival at night.\n\nYes, it might get onto the news that night, but if it's late enough, her family would not necessarily have seen that.\n\nAnd that's the whole point of her text?  Letting them know that she WAS there, but she wasn't hurt and got home okay.  So that if and when they DO see or hear it on the news, they don't immediately wonder about her safety.\n\nIt's also pretty counter-intuitive of you to demand that someone in a mob-panic situation like that exercise reason and logic in the moment.  That's not what most people who experience a mob-panic situation do.  It's really NOT weird at all that she heard \"someone with a gun is shooting people\" and saw cops running in that direction, and concluded -- apparently like everyone around her -- that maybe there was \\*someone shooting people\\*.  By definition, \"someone with a gun shooting people\" is... a mass shooting.\n\nSure, it turned out to be a \"yelling fire in a crowded theater\" thing instead.  But if you're lucky, you don't actually find out which it was until later.  And that's what happened.  She found out later.", "WTF??  OP did not lie.  She thought there was a shooting, only found out later it was a false alarm.  Maybe try working on your reading comprehension", "Maybe, but they don't get shot at that often.\n\nEven if he was a military vet, it wouldn't have excused the behavior just would've been an explanation.", "I mean, when I've been nearby to a shooting, the way I knew was by hearing gunshots.  From the sound of things, the OP experienced being in the same crowd as a fight that was taking place, where someone panicked.  I'm not being critical of the OP for texting what they did, but surviving a mass shooting would imply someone actually fired shots.", "\"She didn't know it *wasn't* until the next day.\"\n\nShe NEVER knew it was.\n\nSpreading the panic by repeating hearsay didn't help her or her mother. \n\nThe boyfriend not understanding how scary being caught in a human stampede is is a good sign they aren't compatible. She wants a partner who will care about her physical and emotional well being, while he doesn't know that other people experience emotions.", "To me that text doesn\u2019t imply you need an immediate response.\n\nIf you wanted to hear from him that same night, *you* needed to communicate that.  Not assume that he would know you want him to call you or text you.", "If you got a text where he told you he was fine, you would be concerned? Why? He said he was fine.", "At a loud festival, though? Rides, music, people -- those events are loud. Gunshots are never as loud as you think they are.  (I've heard them from close by only once, out in front of my apt building, when some guys drove by and shot at the house across the street.  It literally sounded like firecrackers, that's what I thought it was until the next morning when I went outside to find cops all over the place and shell casings in the street.)  You can accomplish a mass shooting with a hand gun. It doesn't have to be a semi-automatic rifle.  (Going by the \"a mass shooting is any incident in which 4 or more people are killed\" definition; has the FBI revised that upwards, at this point?)\n\nI mean, technically -- if someone was shooting at people, and yet OP couldn't hear the shots, then at that point she was \\*probably\\* more in danger of being trampled by a fleeing crowd than of being shot.  But that is definitely a danger in any situation that causes a very large number of people to run in panic.\n\nSo yeah, logic-brain says that, even at the time, she didn't \"survive a mass shooting\" in the sense that she was ever in range of the imaginary gunman, probably.  But if you're in that situation, you have still survived if if you make it out of the panicked mob without sustaining other injuries.  And, at that moment in time, logic-brain isn't the one that's really working.", "No.  If you get that text from someone you love, you respond immediately.  Even if only to say \"I'm glad you're okay!\"  \n\nThis is NOT one of those situations where the other party couldn't possibly tell what the correct response should be, without having been told what you want from them.  This is a situation where, if you have any empathy at all, and if you love someone, your natural response should be to WANT TO TALK TO THEM.  \n\nIf you \\*don't\\* want to talk to them after hearing that news, ask yourself why that is.", "i\u2019d be concerned for his well-being after a traumatic event", "Right, I'm not criticizing the OP for saying they're in a mass shooting after hearing the person yell out that someone's shooting (the person who panicked, after seeing a gun).  I don't know how close they thought they were to possible gunfire, so yes, it could be perceived they were nearby enough to get shot still but not hear the shots.  Obviously, the music wasn't loud enough that they couldn't hear people yelling.", "I wouldn\u2019t read the text to mean that you were there at the time.", "But he just said he was fine. Honestly it sounds like you said you were fine when you actually weren\u2019t and you wanted him to figure that out. Maybe next time, you should try saying what you mean.", "Yeah. I just also feel like it's not improper to say you've survived a mass shooting, even if you weren't in a position to be affected by the gunfire.  An extreme example, but: in the Las Vegas concert shooting, everyone who died \\*was\\* killed by bullets.  But, of over 900 injured, more than half of those had injuries not caused by bullets or shrapnel.  In events like that, it can be just as dangerous to be in the fleeing mob.\n\n(My guess would be that the person they heard yelling about \"someone with a gun is shooting people\" was relatively close to them, because obviously, by that point it became a sort of game of crowd telephone.  Anyone near enough to have seen the gun \\*probably\\* would have realized the guy hadn't started shooting.  But \"a guy just pulled a gun\" starts spreading out and the message mutates until it's \"someone is shooting people\".)", "I think you're kind of nitpicking there.  She was \"fine\" in the sense that she was not injured in any way.  That's what \"im fine and home\" means -- I'm not injured, I'm not at a hospital.\n\nIt should not take a genius to realize that going through that leaves most people rattled.  Even if you don't know whether she's rattled or not, if you love someone, you at LEAST text back AT THAT POINT and say \"wow! i'm glad you're okay!  do you need company?\"\n\nBeyond that, you're criticizing someone who just went through a traumatic event for not \\*composing her text message perfectly\\*.  While she's coming down from the adrenaline high.  Yeah, at a greater remove from the actual panic of the event, you could probably come up with perfect wording.  Or, say, if you're just sitting here reading a story about it, rather than having experienced it.  But she composed that in the immediate aftermath, so cut her some slack.\n\nHer boyfriend is a huge asshole for the \"you're being dramatic for attention\" thing alone."]}
