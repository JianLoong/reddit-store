My dad has remarried and now has a stepdaughter  and him and his wife had another baby, who is at this point.

This year he announced that he\u2019s buying a house. I was really happy for him, since he was beaming with joy and if my dad is happy, i\u2019m happy. \nAfter the announcement I sat down with him to discuss some details and naturally ( since his family is pretty big ) the topic of bedrooms and overall space came up. He said that there are 4 bedrooms in the house and I quote \u201cOur bedroom, your older sisters room, the babies room and your younger brothers room\u201d. When I asked where I would stay when I visited he simply responded there\u2019s a couch I could use. To say the least, that hurt my feelings. Since the divorce I\u2019ve been battling feelings of uselessness and a feeling of being replaceable ( which was facilitated by constantly being compared to my step sister ). My parents divorced because my dad cheated with his now wife and left, so I felt abandoned. In no way do I demand a separate room or anything like that, the only thing I want is to feel like I belong in his life and even in his new family situation and being the only person who doesn\u2019t have a so to say designated space does not help with that.

After a while my dads side of the family started asking why I stopped coming to his house. When I told them about my thoughts and feelings they told me I was a brat and being ungrateful and childish for sacrificing my relationship with my dad for my materialistic desires. Their main stance was \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of having space for me if I don\u2019t live there constantly?\u201d.

As the adult, it\u2019s his responsibility to make sure your emotional and physical needs are taken care of and from your post, this is not the case. You are not a brat and articulated the issue well. If you don\u2019t want to visits, don\u2019t. Talk to your mom and maybe look into a therapist to help with some of this. There are many reasons people go no contact with parents or family members and this is one of them. You need to do what is best for you.

No, you\u2019re feelings are very valid, if they valued your pretense within their family they would have set aside a space for you. I\u2019ve never been in your situation but I see on here alot, from both the divorced parents\u2019 POV and the POV of the kids, how important it is to leave a space to make the shared custody kids feel like they have always have place at their home.

When I was 15 I once asked my dad if I could paint my room, he said your mom\u2019s house right? Because I shared my bedroom as his office even though there was a spare bedroom downstairs that only my grandma stayed in when she came to visit for thanksgiving. \n\nHe may have thought he had been joking, but based on the above and how it was worded he made it sound like I didn\u2019t have a room at his house.

Since your dad's parents are on your side here, talk to them about how to respond when family, at least on their side, gives you grief. At the very least, they can give you advice on what to say to get through to people, who might actually listen to your side and who its better to just ignore.
