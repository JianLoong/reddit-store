The thing is, my fianc\u00e9's (29m) father (54m) hates this movie to the guts. Like, literally. I didn't really care about it, I just never mentioned it to him like ever, knowing he hates it. \n\nI got this tattoo on my arm, and he obviously noticed, but didn't tell me a word about it. He called my fianc\u00e9, who got mad and yelled at me for disrespecting his father's opinion, and told me he's threatening to not come to our wedding and cut us off completely. My fianc\u00e9 didn't even have a problem with this tattoo at first, only now, and asking me to go remove it. \n\nTo add, I've planned this tattoo years before I met my fianc\u00e9, and I didn't get it done to upset his father, which I was accused of.

So is it racist? Sexist? Cruel? Glorifying something disturbing? Pseudo-porn? Ultra-violent?\n\nWhat exactly is FIL's objection to this film, and is it justified?", "NTA, but is it something racist? Did the director of the movie steal his gf? I need more context.", "NTA. You\u2019re a grown ass woman and need not explain yourself over your own body art. It\u2019s important to you. He\u2019s disrespecting you and your relationship over a damn film, and it\u2019s a bit of a red flag that your fianc\u00e9 is demanding you remove it for his sake. I would have a talk with him about what is and isn\u2019t okay for him to request of you, boundaries are important in relationships. You should be free to get tattoos you enjoy and your FIL-to-be needs to grow up. How does one make it to their 50s and still have a fit over not liking something someone else likes? \n\nAlso, you mention he hated the movie which you knew but never mentioned your own attachment/significance to it. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO. again, you\u2019re allowed to like things without permission! Just like you can have them tattooed without permission assuming it isn\u2019t something vile or obscene! Just wanted to put that out there. It\u2019s really bizarre that he would be so worked up over something so small", "NTA but it does sound like you also have a fiance problem. If your fiance was totally fine with it and then all of a sudden as soon as they weren't going to get money they go off and yell at you to get rid of it.

Unless your fianc\u00e9 apologises, I'd get out while you still can!\n\nNot that it particularly matters in the context your your FIL and fianc\u00e9's behaviour, but is the film particularly controversial?

Do NOT marry this man.  I'm sorry but he's asking you to remove a tattoo he knows you wanted for years and is claiming you \"disrespected his father's opinion\"?\n\nHis father's opinion has jack squat to do with your body and his father is throwing a toddler tantrum.

I think you should cut ties and run as fast as you can.", "I don't understand why what we put on OUR bodies is anyone else's business. You got a tattoo that means something to you, and you like it.
