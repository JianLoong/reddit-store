I'm also the lucky  personal slave of 2 tuxedo cats.

You can make new kids right?\". \n\n \nAnd then he said: \"do you love me more or your cats?\"\nSo I answered truthfully that if you get a pet, it's for life, you don't dump them if they're inconvenient. And that I've had my cats for years and love them deeply. Like, they are my kids. So I said:\" I've loved these cats for years, I haven't met you in real life yet, so I don't know what I would miss if you weren't in my life anymore. My cats helped me through trauma.

Plus, he doesn't understand the importance of your relationship with your cats. Big red flags.\n\nI consider this a dodged bullet.", "You\u2026haven\u2019t met him in real life yet? And he wants you to move to a new continent to live with him?\n\nGirl, run. \n\nA more stable, non serial-killer move on his part would be to fly in for a week/weekend so you can have real life time before you know, starting a life with a stranger. \n\nNTA, go with the cats.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd being bluntly honest? As someone living outside of the U.S. who has done the LD thing with American guys over the years, DO NOT make long-term plans to live there if you have not spent a significant amount of time in the United States, and ESPECIALLY not if you have not even met him in person yet. You could be in for SERIOUS disappointment and culture shock. You haven't even known this man for a year, and you've never spent any time with him in person? That's not someone to uproot your life for.\n\nNo matter how long you correspond with, Facetime with, etc. people, it is not REMOTELY the same as spending time in person. Do not give up your home, your job, your life for someone until you have spent real time (like, preferably several months, but at LEAST a lot of weeks) with them in person. People are very, very different in person. \n\nSecondly, and I say this as someone whose closest friends are American: you couldn't pay me enough to move to the United States from almost any other Western country. I get that most Americans will downvote me for saying this, but that country is sliding backwards in record time, with their shockingly antagonistic two-party political system, rolling back human rights faster than you can blink, record highs in violence against marginalised groups (not to mention schoolchildren), a medical system that forces people to bankrupt themselves . . . \n\nI really recommend taking some time to think about this. You're talking about moving to an entirely new country that you've never spent any length of time in, for a man who doesn't even understand (or apparently care about) the most basic things about you, like your love for your pets. He literally thinks cats are interchangeable. What kind of human says things like that? You are NTA, but I don't think you've thought ANY of this through very well.", "NTA. You\u2019re better off without someone who thinks pets are disposable. It also shows he never really bothered to understand you and what you value.", "NTA and steer clear of anybody who tries to make you get rid of your pets.", "Wait a second - besides the obvious and major issues that people have rightfully pointed out about never actually having met him, are you saying with a straight face that a grown ass 38 year old man with children (and all the costs that come with them) JUST became steadily employed? And you're considering this relationship....why?", "NTA you're right pets are not disposable and seems the true him came out when tipsy. You made the right choice.", "NTA - but girl there's a difference between long distance and online/internet bf. You've never met this man in almost a year, that's not a relationship, I'm sorry to say, and he wants you to move accross the world for him? Maybe a meeting in person during a trip would have been best. No one should ask you to get rid of pets simply because you are moving in with them so good on you for standing your ground but may I suggest you find someone in your area who you can meet in person and gage what they are really like off the bat, seems like a long time to find this stuff out now.", "Wait, you have never met your LD partner in real life but are willing to uproot your life to move across the world to live with him?\n\nAt the very least, find someone to take care of your cats for 2 weeks for an extended visit.\n\nWhile the cavalier attitude about the cats is a red flag, there could be many more that you see when living with someone 24/7.  And if you don\u2019t have this trial run, your stuck with your cats not being able to go home.\n\nNTA, but don\u2019t up root your life for this person until you have spent time with him in person.", "NTA\n\nWTH?

Seriously, thats a horrible idea no matter how much you feel like you love him.", "I've never understood someone dating a person with an animal they weren't fond of. \n\nI am not a cat person what-so-ever, but would never start dating someone with cats and then demand they get rid of them. \n\nI have a dog, and if I were single and met someone who told me to get rid of him, I would absolutely break it off with this person. \n\nNTA", "Do not move to the US to live with this guy.

And only since May of 2022 and yall haven't met? He needs a wake up call. I'd choose the cats over him, too.", "NTA. With that attitude, he's not someone you wanted to be with anyway.", "NTA It's good you discovered his true character now and can dump him before you uprooted your life for him.", "NTA. Pets absolutely are for life. The mindset of them being disposable when inconvenient is toxic and a big red flag to me.", ">I replied:\" Okay bring your kids to the pound and then I'll dump my cats. You can make new kids right?\".\n\nNTA - and it is a deal breaker.  He's asking/pretty much demanding you abandon your pets.  If you did, it wouldn't be the last concession he'd ask/demand you make.", "Wait, hold up.  You haven't met in person and you're planning to move in with him?  What if you don't like him in real life?  Like, what if he smells bad or has intolerable habits or something? What if he's been obscuring the fact that the reason he was unemployed until recently is that he's broadly unemployable somehow?  You have an extremely narrow perspective on who this person is, curated and controlled entirely by him.  At least consider planning a few visits before immigrating permanently.", "NTA. You are about to move the states for a guy you don\u2019t know in real live?!", "Love me, love my cat. Or at least accept that I have and love one. \n\nNTA. But girl, this guy is all red flags", "Nta. Your logic is sound.", "NTA ... And people can be very different \"in person\" than they seem from a distance.  I wouldn't be so eager to uproot my life for someone I've never spent time with personally.  Giving up your cats is not a reasonable thing to ask.", "NTA\n\nHis attitude is a good bit of luck for you.\n\nHe wants you to uproot your whole life?  Move to a different country?  Go through all the expense and trouble of immigration paperwork?  Get rid of your cats?\n\nWhen you've never even met him in person?!?!?!?!!?!\n\nYou dodged a bullet.  This move would have left you extraordinarily vulnerable.  \n\nIf he's serious, and you're serious, then take your time, and visit each other a few times first.  Stay in a hotel, meet only in public the first few visits.  \n\nMoving to live with someone you've never met before, in a foreign nation, is an easy way to wind up in the wrong column in statistics spreadsheets.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou can always get a new bf that respects your fur babies.

There may be no chemistry there in real life. He might have serious personal hygiene issues. He might have characteristics, habits, addictions, health issues etc etc you can\u2019t deal with. Millions of people think they fall in love online. Look at all the people who give all their money away to someone they are totally in love with but doesn\u2019t actually exist. I\u2019m not American and in the past I used to look at the life Americans had and be so jealous. Their houses are huge, they have several bathrooms, they have Disneyland etc etc. it\u2019s evident to me now as a European that life in the US isn\u2019t always as glamorous as it seems. Look at their healthcare and the fact everyone seems to have 3 jobs, it doesn\u2019t seem too glamorous now. \n\nIf you\u2019re convinced you\u2019re in love visit him a few times.

I live in California, trust me when I say you do not want to be poor living here.\n\nThe fact you\u2019ve never even met your bf in person and he \u201cjust\u201d got a steady job leads me to believe you are going to have a really tough time if you move.
