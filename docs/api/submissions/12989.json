But he didn't feel like he lost anyone. He said he thought Emma was beginning to notice more since he  wasn't crying and didn't really have much trouble continuing with life as normal.

She heard my nephew say he hadn't ever experienced a personal loss before and wasn't sure how it would go but he would always let his friend talk.

So my nephew gets to stay with me.\n\nMy brother has accused me of taking his son away from him and told me I should be ashamed of myself. He said it wasn't my place to get so involved. I told him I didn't take his son, he chose to leave, and that if he didn't want his son \"taken away\" he should have been a better father.

Where is your nephew's biological mother in all of this?", "I know there's no time limit on grief from losing a child because burying a child is the worst thing a parent can do. But the fact that Emma essentially kicked her stepson out of her house for not being the same stage of grief as she is 8 years later is deeply concerning. If anything you are letting your brother off lightly. He should started trying to persuade his wife to see a grief therapist 8 years ago. \n\nI can't even process the amount of unaddressed trauma that must be behind genuinely feeling devastated to the point of kicking out your stepson because you discovered he didn't find your son's death as harrowing as you, the parent. Especially when they only knew each other only 3 years and the entire time it was known your late son & stepson disliked each other and didn't consider each other family.

The fact he doesn't consider her son's death a huge blow to him, a huge loss for him, is twisting her with anger and you're right, it's not healthy, at all. She's angry that a boy who didn't get along with her son isn't grief stricken that he's gone and she's fixated on this. Maybe she believes her son would have reacted and felt differently. Or maybe she's just so stuck that my nephew is the easiest person to lash out at.\n\nMy brother is clearly on Emma's side in this.", "Also, please check with your nephew and arrange for therapy. Years of Emma's constant spying and whatnot would have done a number on him, I'd guess. Please take care of him", "Was your brother as destroyed by Logans death as Emma?\n\nBecause I can't help but suspect Emma's anger isn't just at your nephew. And that's why your brother wants him back in the house. Emma's probably angry her husband gets to parent his child while she lost hers. And that's a subconscious reason why she's deliberately trying to ruin their relationship. She's probably furious because deep down she knows no one in the house mourned Logan on the level she does. Doesn't sound like his bio father was involved. Your brother probably didn't have enough time with Logan to truly love him exactly the same as his own. Being united in blaming your nephew is probably the only thing holding that marriage together. Most marriages fall apart after the death of a child, and those are marriages where both spouses were parents from birth and everyone is mourning the same amount.", "She's angry that Logan died instead of him.

He didn't have a close relationship with a step sibling. Who died 9 years ago (ish). Of course he didn't feel a personal loss himself. He saw others going through loss (Emma) so he was being kind.

To be upset the nephew moved on without memorializing a shrine is ludicrous.", "Wait so she\u2019s been spying on his social interactions for 8 whole years??? NTA! That is insane!", "Even if he had everyone grieves differently! My son\u2019s best friend lost his mom when he was like 10 and I has always seemed so unfazed by it, do I think he didn\u2019t love his mom? No, he just has different ways to cope.", "Since CPS is involved, could you get listed as a kinship caregiver? That would make him eligible for college aid as a foster child and he wouldn't need parent income on the FAFSA.", "Emancipation is never easy and requires the minor to be fully self sufficient both emotionally and financially.  It's exceedingly rare.  In this case my guess is that it will instead be a case of formalizing the guardianship allowing OP to act as guardian for school, doctors, etc.  In some states that will require a judges order but at 17 and with no concerns about OPs household judges will generally just go with what the minor wants.", "Yup- I tried, and failed, to be emancipated. Instead I moved out the day I turned 18.\n\nThat said emancipation isn't required to remove parents from FAFSA consideration, just a lot of documentation.", "Journaling is cool. I think it helps tremendously in our internal lives. \n\nI just hope he understands that therapy  isn't about HIM being terrible, but more about the impact ON HIM by his terrible parent and step-parent. \n\nAnd also, I think mental health care should be a part of routine preventive maintenance. I went to couples counseling way   back when I first got married and realized that seeing someone didn't always have to be about having an active problem. That sometimes, a tune-up for the mind and emotions and mentally  and stuff can just mean reflecting about past stuff, but also thinking about present and future stuff and learning some tools to deal with possible situations that might crop up. Like it's nice to talk to a mental health care person about a big upcoming event- maybe a new job or a new marriage or whatever and asking for help in learning some skills to deal with any  likely obstacles that might come up. \n\nI think a lot of the time we think of therapy  as a fix after-the-fact, but it really  can be an important tool for developing skills to deal with FUTURE set-backs and speed bumps. \n\nLike it's been about ten years since my last tune-up and I am looking around for someone to chat with about the last ten years and some big events coming up in the future- retirement, etc. I'm going in, not because I have a HUGE issue to solve or someone abused me or I  was harmed in some way, but more for me and my  life continuing with adequate skills to deal with all the shit life throws at you. \n\nJust my  thoughts on mental health care.", "Journaling is an excellent therapeutic tool. That alone helps him get his feelings and thoughts out in the open.  Just keep the communication lines open. You are on the right path. You cannot force someone to go to therapy. Therapy only works if your nephew wants to participate. Right now it appears he doesn't. As he begins to feel safe and developed more trust in you then you can nudge him. NTA", "Isn't a massive part of being a good parent protecting your child from abuse? Isn't a massive part of being a good partner is letting your loved one know when you think they need to seek professional help? Brother sat back and watched his wife be consumed by grief to the point where her anger & grief controls her life. Knowing that he chooses to help her abuse his only child. Brother is the literally most responsible for this situation escalating to this point.", "This step mom will never move past this and perhaps your brother has been faking his own grief so she doesn't leave him.", "Ahhh... well that makes more sense.", "There\u2019s no timeline on grief. My dad lost his dad almost 15 years ago and he\u2019s still grieving. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to lose a child. Emma is allowed to grieve her son, even 8 years later. But what she\u2019s not allowed to do is use her grief as an excuse and take her issues out on other people. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right though. Emma needs professional help. She needs a therapist. She needs to quit projecting her own expectations of grief on to the nephew. Her own personal grief is not the issue. The issue is that she is trying to force op\u2019s nephew into grieving someone that he neither loved nor cared for. \n\nNta op. You took your nephew out of a rather piss poor situation. And if you\u2019re brother didn\u2019t want to be accused of being a Shit dad, then he should have been a better one. The onus is on him. Not you and most certainly not on your nephew. Please tell your nephew that I am very sorry that he is having to deal with this and that I\u2019m happy that he at least has you to depend on.", ">Your brother chose Emma, but your nephew didn't have a choice about Logan. If he had, he probably would not have wanted to share his home.\n\nWorse, it seems the brother/father choose Logan over son/nephew.", "Is your Dad my Mom? Full on funeral attendance and grieving for the most tenuous of acquaintances. Can't understand why I won't fly in for funerals of people I barely knew or haven't spoken with for 20 years.", "Agreed. Not sure where you are. In Canada here, youth under age 18 can voluntarily enter care through something called a vysa.... Voluntary youth services agreement.\nThat way he can receive support for post secondary education", "You don't need to jump through all those hoops. I never legally emancipated but was able to document my lack of relationship with my mother and make it so her income wasn't considered. It requires working with the financial aid office of the school, and typically documentation from people around (I had letters from my principal).\n\nA combination of documentation from his aunt (OP), CPS, and even letters from friends can help prove his case.", "Unfortunately kinship care doesn't count as foster care in the eyes of colleges, at least where I live. I was banking on that my whole life so it was a slap to the face when I found out", "Props to you for supporting your nephew when his father and stepmother are failing in their parental role.\n\nHas your nephew expressed a desire for professional therapy though? (Not saying that he needs therapy for the death of his stepbrother.) just that being 17 is difficult enough, but becoming estranged from his father at 17 must be stressful.", "Thank you for being there for him. \n\nYour brother's lack of empathy and understanding of his son is really gross. He should go to a counselor himself to understand why his son reacted this way. It's not uncommon at all in blended families. He needs to sort his own bad parenting out before family therapy with his son starts.\n\nAnd Emma needs some professional help also.", "My mom\u2019s family is like that but my mom herself is the complete opposite, I have never once seen her cry for not even her parents even when they lived with us.", "Doesn't that depend on the judgement of the school? Whereas a foster child will be automatically independent in FAFSA.", "I had to go this route as well. I think they called it declaration of a minority or something weird like that. My state didn't do emancipations anymore so this was the only option.", "Just tell him it might be ideal to talk about this with a neutral party who at least is qualified to be more insightful being able to offer constructive advice. Suggest onky 2 sessions and if he sees it not helping then no dramas. Highlight your not getting him to do it to rekindle things with them but it might help explain what they were doing to him and how unhealthy it was...to help him move forward better and better informed.", "It might help to ask him what he thinks therapy is. If he thinks therapy means he's an evil monster, he doesn't understand what it's for. Try explaining it's not to 'fix' him as a person but to help work through problems. On their own terms, at their own pace, with someone who isn't connected.\n\nIt's not because you think there's anything wrong with him, but because he's had a bad time and could do with more support. A therapist isn't going to push for a certain resolution and isn't going to affect other parts of his life unless he puts his life at risk.", "I definitely understand that, and I agree that pushing it would be a bad plan. One idea, though, are you going to therapy? The way the world is I'm of the opinion that everyone probably needs some kind of therapy or at least a trained person to talk to. Could you go for yourself and then talk to him about what you're doing to normalize it as a healthy thing people do?", "but why it was only a step brother he only knew a few years and didn't form a close bond", "Your brother sounds like he would have been well served by having an older sibling to kick his fucking ass.", "That's where things get tricky. There are basically multiple levels of awards that come out of FAFSA- both public and private funds.\n\nIf you want to exclude your parents from FAFSA but want to qualify for financial aid via things like the Pell Grant you have to convince the government, not the school. However, the schools ultimately get the money so they're super helpful in doing this. None of this requires the schools approval, but their assistance is pretty useful.\n\nPrivate grants are more tricky, but at least for me going through the process with the financial aid office to remove my mothers income from consideration was enough for them to support me applying for the private and school based aid. Keep in mind though that being a foster kid doesn't automatically give you this private aid either though, you still have to apply and put forth a case for them, and they're very subjective.", "Yes, because the way to stop the cycle of emotional abuse and/or neglect is definitely physical violence."]}
