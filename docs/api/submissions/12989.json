Then my brother met his wife Emma and Emma's son Logan. Logan and my nephew had a very oil and water relationship and were not close at all. They were stepbrothers for about 18 months and had known each other for about 3 years when Logan died suddenly. Emma fell apart, unsurprisingly. My nephew confided in me a few times that he felt like everyone expected him to be feeling and reacting differently than he did. He told me he wasn't glad Logan was dead and it was sad. But he didn't feel like he lost anyone. He said he thought Emma was beginning to notice more since he  wasn't crying and didn't really have much trouble continuing with life as normal. I told him it was okay to feel that way, as long as he was compassionate of others, and if he needed to talk he could always come to me.\n\nMy nephew turned 17 three months ago and he begged to move in with my family. Things were bad with my brother and Emma. For about a year before Emma had been quizzing my nephew about Logan and all things connected. Then before Christmas she decided to spy on my nephew and his friend. His friend had lost his dad and sister in a car crash and my nephew was consoling him. She heard my nephew say he hadn't ever experienced a personal loss before and wasn't sure how it would go but he would always let his friend talk. Emma went nuts on the boys and chased the friend off, who was already upset. My nephew ended up yelling at her and the other boys parents called my brother. My brother told my nephew he should be ashamed of himself for being so dismissive of his brother's death.\n\nThis is when my nephew called. I was able to let him stay, mostly due to the police not wanting to drag him back to my brothers house (he called them) and my having already contacted CPS in order to talk about what was going on and they sent someone to talk to my nephew and then my brother and Emma. So my nephew gets to stay with me.\n\nMy brother has accused me of taking his son away from him and told me I should be ashamed of myself. He said it wasn't my place to get so involved. I told him I didn't take his son, he chose to leave, and that if he didn't want his son \"taken away\" he should have been a better father. This is when he told me I was overstepping and I should see his POV and how awful it is what my nephew has said and done...\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679576322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zjm8p/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_should_have_been_a/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But she may be taking it out on the child who is living, specially since he\u2019s not her son. She has misplaced resentment, and it\u2019s not healthy for your nephew to be in that environment.

She believes he should have been torn up losing his only sibling. But he never saw Logan as his sibling, and the two were not close, and anyone could see there was no love there when Logan was alive. Maybe it would have changed over time. But for my nephew it was not the loss of a sibling he felt.\n\nBut yes. She spied on him, did not like that he acknowledged to his friend that he never lost anyone important to him, though it sounds like she was just waiting to hear him say something she could pull him on.", "I have suggested he go to therapy but right now he's not interested.

So while he may think he's ok, this is having no long term emotional impact on him, he would never behave like them, the only way to truly break the cycle is not to repeat their behaviours. They refused to address their grief and seek a professional. Not ending up like them means doing these two things.", "I wonder why not?  I had a cousin leave home at 17 and the community college actually recommended it for financial aid reasons.  Where is your nephew's biological mother in all of this?", "I know there's no time limit on grief from losing a child because burying a child is the worst thing a parent can do. But the fact that Emma essentially kicked her stepson out of her house for not being the same stage of grief as she is 8 years later is deeply concerning. If anything you are letting your brother off lightly. He should started trying to persuade his wife to see a grief therapist 8 years ago. \n\nI can't even process the amount of unaddressed trauma that must be behind genuinely feeling devastated to the point of kicking out your stepson because you discovered he didn't find your son's death as harrowing as you, the parent. Especially when they only knew each other only 3 years and the entire time it was known your late son & stepson disliked each other and didn't consider each other family. That difference in levels of grief in the same household should have been addressed, processed and accepted within the first 3 years of his passing. What is your brother playing at letting this situation drag on to this extent?", "I don't blame him.", "Okay. I just wondered.", "Totally agree and I will.", "I worry about pushing that line because I do not want him to think I am comparing him to them. If he doesn't want any kind of therapy after a bit more time I will try gently bringing it up. But I don't want him to feel like every adult in his life sees him as some evil monster. Because he knows that's how Emma and his dad are treating him.", "Every state is different from what I know and some are very strict on that. She was never in his life. She abandoned him at the hospital when he was born.", "I think it even goes deeper. She's angry that he never felt the level of grief she wanted him to. The fact he doesn't consider her son's death a huge blow to him, a huge loss for him, is twisting her with anger and you're right, it's not healthy, at all. She's angry that a boy who didn't get along with her son isn't grief stricken that he's gone and she's fixated on this. Maybe she believes her son would have reacted and felt differently. Or maybe she's just so stuck that my nephew is the easiest person to lash out at.\n\nMy brother is clearly on Emma's side in this.", "Also, please check with your nephew and arrange for therapy. Years of Emma's constant spying and whatnot would have done a number on him, I'd guess. Please take care of him", "Was your brother as destroyed by Logans death as Emma?\n\nBecause I can't help but suspect Emma's anger isn't just at your nephew. And that's why your brother wants him back in the house. Emma's probably angry her husband gets to parent his child while she lost hers. And that's a subconscious reason why she's deliberately trying to ruin their relationship. She's probably furious because deep down she knows no one in the house mourned Logan on the level she does. Doesn't sound like his bio father was involved. Your brother probably didn't have enough time with Logan to truly love him exactly the same as his own. Being united in blaming your nephew is probably the only thing holding that marriage together. Most marriages fall apart after the death of a child, and those are marriages where both spouses were parents from birth and everyone is mourning the same amount.", "She's angry that Logan died instead of him. I guarantee she thinks 10 times a day, \"Why couldn't it have been HIM instead of my son?\""]}
