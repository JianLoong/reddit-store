Then my brother met his wife Emma and Emma's son Logan. Logan and my nephew had a very oil and water relationship and were not close at all. They were stepbrothers for about 18 months and had known each other for about 3 years when Logan died suddenly. Emma fell apart, unsurprisingly. My nephew confided in me a few times that he felt like everyone expected him to be feeling and reacting differently than he did. He told me he wasn't glad Logan was dead and it was sad. But he didn't feel like he lost anyone. He said he thought Emma was beginning to notice more since he  wasn't crying and didn't really have much trouble continuing with life as normal. I told him it was okay to feel that way, as long as he was compassionate of others, and if he needed to talk he could always come to me.\n\nMy nephew turned 17 three months ago and he begged to move in with my family. Things were bad with my brother and Emma. For about a year before Emma had been quizzing my nephew about Logan and all things connected. Then before Christmas she decided to spy on my nephew and his friend. His friend had lost his dad and sister in a car crash and my nephew was consoling him. She heard my nephew say he hadn't ever experienced a personal loss before and wasn't sure how it would go but he would always let his friend talk. Emma went nuts on the boys and chased the friend off, who was already upset. My nephew ended up yelling at her and the other boys mom and grandparents called my brother. My brother told my nephew he should be ashamed of himself for being so dismissive of his brother's death.\n\nThis is when my nephew called. I was able to let him stay, mostly due to the police not wanting to drag him back to my brothers house (he called them) and my having already contacted CPS in order to talk about what was going on and they sent someone to talk to my nephew and then my brother and Emma. So my nephew gets to stay with me.\n\nMy brother has accused me of taking his son away from him and told me I should be ashamed of myself. He said it wasn't my place to get so involved. I told him I didn't take his son, he chose to leave, and that if he didn't want his son \"taken away\" he should have been a better father.

Where is your nephew's biological mother in all of this?", "I know there's no time limit on grief from losing a child because burying a child is the worst thing a parent can do. But the fact that Emma essentially kicked her stepson out of her house for not being the same stage of grief as she is 8 years later is deeply concerning. If anything you are letting your brother off lightly. He should started trying to persuade his wife to see a grief therapist 8 years ago. \n\nI can't even process the amount of unaddressed trauma that must be behind genuinely feeling devastated to the point of kicking out your stepson because you discovered he didn't find your son's death as harrowing as you, the parent. Especially when they only knew each other only 3 years and the entire time it was known your late son & stepson disliked each other and didn't consider each other family.

The fact he doesn't consider her son's death a huge blow to him, a huge loss for him, is twisting her with anger and you're right, it's not healthy, at all. She's angry that a boy who didn't get along with her son isn't grief stricken that he's gone and she's fixated on this. Maybe she believes her son would have reacted and felt differently. Or maybe she's just so stuck that my nephew is the easiest person to lash out at.\n\nMy brother is clearly on Emma's side in this.", "Also, please check with your nephew and arrange for therapy. Years of Emma's constant spying and whatnot would have done a number on him, I'd guess. Please take care of him", "Was your brother as destroyed by Logans death as Emma?\n\nBecause I can't help but suspect Emma's anger isn't just at your nephew. And that's why your brother wants him back in the house. Emma's probably angry her husband gets to parent his child while she lost hers. And that's a subconscious reason why she's deliberately trying to ruin their relationship. She's probably furious because deep down she knows no one in the house mourned Logan on the level she does. Doesn't sound like his bio father was involved. Your brother probably didn't have enough time with Logan to truly love him exactly the same as his own. Being united in blaming your nephew is probably the only thing holding that marriage together. Most marriages fall apart after the death of a child, and those are marriages where both spouses were parents from birth and everyone is mourning the same amount.", "She's angry that Logan died instead of him.

He didn't have a close relationship with a step sibling. Who died 9 years ago (ish). Of course he didn't feel a personal loss himself. He saw others going through loss (Emma) so he was being kind.

The next time you do bring it up make sure to also talk about all the different forms of therapy options there are, art therapy, music therapy, etc. It might also be useful to use the term counselling instead if he has such a negative connotation with therapy! \n\nAnother suggestion is to offer to go to a session or two together to help ease him into it (my partner only became receptive to individual therapy after we did some couples counselling). You could frame it as wanting to get on the same page with him to make sure you\u2019re both comfortable with the new living situation and any rules/boundaries you both need. I imagine it\u2019s could be a tricky given how old he is.

But now, when I think about him, I think of him as the living man who loved me and participated in my life. I can\u2019t give an exact timeline, because as you say it\u2019s different for different people, but with my family as an example, I\u2019d say that 1.5-3 years is where that transition generally happened. That\u2019s right around the time where most of us moved from remembering him with pain and sadness to being able to laugh when we talked about him.\n\nIt\u2019s also around that length of time when I stopped feeling like I needed an outlet for the grief, and I wasn\u2019t using my pain as a reason to lash out and hurt others. There will always be pain, but at some point it stops being an understandable reason to cause pain to other people. \n\nThat\u2019s where I think OP\u2019s SIL is in an unhealthy grief pattern.

I don\u2019t expect her to stop grieving for the son she lost, she loves him and that\u2019s not a bad or wrong thing.

Like, you know you lost someone and you can normally just go about your day without it overriding everything, but sometimes things hit you and you really miss them. \n\nI lost 2 pregnancies pretty late and while it's not loosing a child, sometimes I do look at my living kids (born after my loss) and think of those babies. It's not constant, but it's normally around my loss dates. I feel like it's normal to miss them and what could have been...but at the same time, I don't plan to burden my living kids with it.", "And if you had taken the time to truly read mine, or the clarification that I just added for your benefit, you would revise your \"because of comments like yours I can't grieve\" accusation.

It does happen, and would be more understandable in the first year or two, but she has so much hostility that she takes out not only on her stepson, but on his grieving friend.

It took him around 2 years to move past the initial \u201cgut punch\u201d feeling when he thought about his dad. My dad, even in the throes of his grief, never pushed it onto us. He wasn\u2019t angry. He wasn\u2019t short. He just wasn\u2019t *there*. It took a long time, as well as professional help, for him to be ok. He spent most of his time in the shed, hugging my grandpa\u2019s blanket. We didn\u2019t see much of him. He just quit living and started existing. \n\nWas that grief healthy? No. But he needed to go through it so that he could find his way to healthy grief. Eventually, like you, my dad got to the point where he could remember all of the good about my grandpa instead of just remembering him on life support. He still takes his moments outside, but he\u2019s learned to bear the weight in a healthy manner, rather than a self-destructive one. \n\nEmma\u2019s grief isn\u2019t healthy. She isn\u2019t stepping away to take a breather, she\u2019s suffocating herself and everyone else with her need to grieve and see others grieve. Grief itself isn\u2019t unhealthy. Like you said, you still grieve your dad even 25 years later. Methods of dealing with grief is what becomes unhealthy. If you never learn to grow from the most painful memories, and instead choose to wallow in it. Grief, in the beginning, isn\u2019t an *excuse* for lashing out, but it\u2019s an explanation.

Each time a little\u2026 less. But never gone.", "Honestly, that sounds pretty healthy. Sounds like maybe he still has some stuff to work through, maybe he is, but if it\u2019s not negatively effecting him or others? Sounds reasonably healthy.", "Still don\u2019t see any reason to have this child TAKEN by the authorities. Unless he was in danger, his dad and stepmom being unhappy with his reaction isn\u2019t abusive parenting.", "Exactly how I would put it. The loss is always there, but grieving is the (painful) process of coming to terms with that loss.", "Op didn\u2019t call the authorities to remove the nephew from his house. They were called, by the nephew, to make sure he could stay with op. Op said the father and stepmother had a history with CPS already. \n\n\u201c\u201dThis is when my nephew called. I was able to let him stay, mostly due to the police not wanting to drag him back to my brothers house (he called them) and my having already contacted CPS in order to talk about what was going on and they sent someone to talk to my nephew and then my brother and Emma. So my nephew gets to stay with me.\u201d\u201d\n\nNobody took the nephew from his father. I think op\u2019s phrasing of \u201ctaking the nephew\u201d is because the father said she \u201ctook his son\u201d.\n\n\u201c\u201dMy brother has accused me of taking his son away from him and told me I should be ashamed of myself. He said it wasn't my place to get so involved. I told him I didn't take his son, he chose to leave.\u201d\u201d"]}
