During the custody battle, my ex tried to allege all sorts of physical and psychological abuse by me, none of which were true.  I brought up her troubling mental health history.  In the end, I was awarded full custody.\n\nDuring the almost two years we fought this battle, my son was in his mother's sole custody.  He had been subjected to a relentless campaign of parental alienation and was convinced I was some kind of rage monster.  And in a perverse twist of fate, the fact that I acted nothing like that just caused him even more anxiety.  I kept him no-contact with his mother.\n\nWhen he first came to me, he acted like a much younger child.  As time passed, he started acting more like his actual age.  He's a lot better now.\n\nMy ex has not stopped trying to get him back.  She filed several more court motions, and had friends file false CPS reports against me.  None of it worked.\n\nMy son recently celebrated his birthday.  My ex dropped off a bunch of presents at our doorstep for him.  I sent her a short email thanking her for the presents and asking if she wanted to have a video chat with our son.  This would represent her first contact with him since I was awarded custody.\n\nHer email response was pure virtiol.  I had neither the emotional maturity nor parental experience to even attempt to understand what our son was feeling.  I am mentally incompetent and devoid of empathy, so I must have been prompted by some third party to suggest this call.  (I'm politely paraphrasing to keep word searches from finding this post; her actual word choice was a lot meaner.)\n\nAt the end of this nastygram she agreed to the video chat.  I didn't respond other than to send her a link.\n\nMy son eagerly looked forward to this call.  I had scheduled ninety minutes, but it barely lasted half an hour.  My ex was having connectivity issues. The call was of poor quality and eventually just died.\n\nMy son was heartbroken.  He loves his mother and was aching for this contact.  The next day he was crying because he hadn't had the full ninety minutes he'd been promised.\n\nI am refusing to reschedule the call.  Not only because of her response, but also because after the call my son reverted to the almost-infantile mode of speaking he'd been using when I first got sole custody.  He was back to his usual way of speaking the next day, but in my judgment contact with his mother is damaging his mental health.\n\nHowever, I'm worried that this is just a rationalization.  I am admittedly quite annoyed by my wife's nastygram.  I'm afraid I'm letting my own personal anger cause my son hurt and dismay because he didn't get all the time he was promised with his mother on his birthday.\n\nAITA for not rescheduling a birthday video chat between my ex and our son because of the nasty way she responded to the original invitation?", "created_utc": 1684431764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l5ium/aita_for_refusing_to_reschedule_an_interrupted/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially if it was traumatic and difficult. Happens a lot with foster kids who go to see their family for scheduled visits. The next 12-48 hours can be really difficult.  \n\nIt is even similar to my own kids going to the grandparents house. We have to de-grandparent them for a day or two by getting back tight on discipline, not allowing certain behavior, and making sure all is fair.   \n\nThe kid probably needs to talk with his mom now and again but who knows. Let a counselor decide that one. He is just having a normal reaction to a tough time. Best thing to do is schedule some fun stuff to help redirect (I am guessing he is still pretty young) or if he is older - some talk it out time.", "INFO what does your son's therapist say?", "NTA - Sounds like there's a lot of damage done already.  Do you have him seeing a professional Therapist?  If not, I would do so immediately.", "Man I'm saying YTA for proceeding with the call after the \"nastygram\", that should have been your cue that no good would come of this. Not to mention you say it was against the advice of professionals. \n\nStop stringing him along, he needs a clean break, as much as it may seem cruel to stop a kid from seeing his mother.", "Question: divorce is traumatic for kids, then add a contentious one in the mix,does he see a therapist or medical professional about this? Because I think that might be best, having a psychologist really speak to what is mentally healthy for your son at this point.", "NTA, but that could change based on how you move forward. \n\nI get that this is hard, and it sounds like outside perspective and guidance is needed. If your son has a therapist, and he absolutely should, talk to them about the situation. Ask them what is best and healthiest for your son in this particular situation, and then move forward with that. \n\nYour feelings toward your ex are palpable in this post, and while I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not justified, it\u2019s not a great place to make parenting decisions from. Seek counsel from people who are not biased and have a vested interest in the wellbeing of your son. \n\nI hope in the coming years, you all find a way to form healthy relationships all around.", "NTA sounds like you need to ask your therapist and court for supervised visits to start. She clearly needs objective adult supervision, and you need to stay out of it to protect the rebuilding you are doing with you and your sons relationship", "NTA! Don\u2019t do it again. When the therapist thinks he is ready then take it from there", "NTA\n\nLook, you gave her a 90 minute window. You didn't guarantee her 90 minutes. \n\nThe fact that her connection wasn't good and whatever else just means that she didn't get organized, likely. (She'd know if her connection wasn't good, generally.) \n\nEither way, your son's behaviour regression shows that he doesn't respond positively to being in contact with her and that's all there is to it, in addition to the therapists telling you not to.", "it sounds like your ex is really trying to make you reschedule the call and i understand your hesitation because of what the outcome of the last one did to your son, but i have to ask-- do you think a successful redo of the call would affect him in a positive way, and help lead to more positive interactions with his mother? if so, then i would consider if you're just trying to keep him no-contact with her, and finding reasons to do so.", "NTA.", "YTA. Your ex PROVES to you solid as granite with her email that she is still terrible, and you then AGREE to the video call still? You need to improve your judgement.", "Yta - talk to your kid's therapist and do what's best for HIM. He's already being punished by having a set of parents who are using him to torture each other. \n\nIf the therapist recommends not to reschedule, then don't.", "[deleted]", "NTA for the way you feel, moving forward though can be difficult. \n\nYour instincts to keep your child safe make you want to cut contact, but if the CHILD DESIRES contact, you run the risk if resentment by withholding...\n\nMaybe approach it with the therapists? Perhaps they would want to do a monitored video call so they could see these reactions as well to aid in treatment.", "YWBTTA if you ignore that your child still craves the contact with his mother.  We coparent with imperfect people. But, the job of coparenting means that the child still has the option of contact with their other parent. Its the kid's right. And if your ex is not harming your son, then let the child have the contact.\n\nI don't care two sticks about your ex. But, your kid shouldn't be punished because your ex is unbalanced and vitriolic towards YOU. If she was that way with your son, then I could see not offering a second chance at a conference call.\n\nSo consult his therapist about what is best for him after the last encounter left him altered for a day. The therapist should have reasonable insight and you can make a healthy decision supported by his health practitioner. Since they have advised in the past that she is unhealthy for him, be prepared to actually accept their wisdom?\n\nNTA at all for wanting your child to be happy, healthy, safe and secure. No one can blame you for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You also need a professional opinion about how to help him with his developmental issues.  This kid has been used as a proxy in the war between the two of you, and while that may not be your fault, if you really are the good, reasonable, adult parent, you need to prove it and get real advice on how to help him, rather than just doing this seat-of-the-pants.", "NTA   But figure out whether the problem for the son was the contact, or the fact that the video call didn't work out the way he wanted and he didn't actually get to contact her the way he had hoped.", "NTA.  That girl is poison.", "After reading through the initial list and some of your later responses.\n\nsoft YTA\n\nI get it.  You love your son.  Your son was desperate for contact with his mother..  You didnt want to seem like the bad guy,  \n\nTherapists have advised no contact with the mother.  That is where YTA.\n\nYour soe has been through a great emotional upheaval for two years..  The therapists know more than you, or your Ex.  Please listen to them.\n\nParents who have been manipulative, will continue to manipulate.  I assume the therapists advice no contact is because they believe your ex will manipulate every contact  she gets with child.  You son will continue to be torn between your two.  He sounds  like he is young and doesn't have the mental development to decide when someone is lying or manipulating him.\n\nHe sound like he is a child in need of a calm environments where he can grow and discover himself.", "NTA, you need to only allow supervised visits with a counselor. That must be preceded by a real course of counseling for your son so that the counselor will know when to cut her off if she engages in the abusive behavior during the visit!", "This is the best answer. I was also going to bring up the resemblance of this situation with the foster care/bio family example. Based on what I've learned in the adoption community, I would think that having a brief video chat with his mother on a regular basis could be good for the child. However, it sounds like the child has therapists who are not recommending contact at the moment. If OP trusts those therapists, he should listen to their recommendations. There may be safe, constructive ways for the child to have contact with his mother, and he and the therapists should probably look into those. \n\nIn any case, NTA.", "He is seeing a couple of therapists, and they both agree with him being no-contact with his mother.

He broke those orders. Definitely NTA, he should have just never given the opportunity at all.\n\nThe son only suffers because of the mother. She is damaging to his mental health.", "NTA. I would suggest though, that if you do eventually allow him to video chat with his mother again, do not tell him a time frame. This way when the call ends, it ends.", "Honestly this sounds like it's above Reddit's paygrade. If you trust his therapy team you should probably let them lead here.", "Yes. You were for that. Now explain to him that you have concerns because of how the call you went and when you, he, AND the therapists agree, the call will be rescheduled for another time. \n\nAnd then explain that sometimes people promise things with good intentions but have unexpected bad outcomes and you have to accept that and change direction.

I recommend consulting with your attorney about everything to see what options there are, and how to go about moving forward with this.  And talk to the therapist about it first as well.~~\n\nEditing because I saw your note that all the therapists recommended your son go NC with his mom and that the video call was against those recommendations.
