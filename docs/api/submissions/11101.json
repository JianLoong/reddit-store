Childbirth is a major event and doesn\u2019t come without risks, the woman needs to feel supported by people she trusts, so it was very important for your sister that your mom was there. And your argument about being the second kid doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever. Are you less important than your older sister because you\u2019re \u201canother child\u201d? To your Mom, that wasn\u2019t the birth of \u201cjust another grandkid\u201d. It doesn\u2019t make it any less important or special. Imagine if your grandma was like \u201coh he\u2019s the second child, I\u2019ve already been there for one, so I don\u2019t care so much to be there for him\u201d. Anyway. Your mom was right; you were very selfish. I was too when I was a teenager, but please learn with your mistakes moving on.", "YTA but honestly that is down to your folks in a lot of ways.  \nIf you have zero concept of responsibility and helping and having to understand priorities...well, did your mom never expect you to, before?", "You are NOT the A-hole!\n\nI'm a mother and i hate this bullshit when a parent, grandparent, sister or whatever trys to force someone for watching a child.\n\nThis is not okay.", "YTA. search up \u201cweaponised incompetence\u201d. all you had to do was ask how to change her and what & when to feed her. you couldn\u2019t watch your niece for what, not even a few hours? pathetic & extremely entitled.", "My mom watches her once in awhile but my sister usually doesn\u2019t need a sitter", "Yup! It\u2019s crazy how this thing called the internet can help us with things like \u201chow to change a diaper\u201d or \u201cwhat to feed a 2 yr old\u201d nowadays. Especially for a one off emergency. But probably OP doesn\u2019t know about the internet, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re on Reddit or anything.", "Wait did you just ask why she needed her husband at the birth of his child?", "I had both my husband and mom there in case I died. Wanted to be with two people who loved me most.", "he's 17 not 10, its not hard to google/ask advice over text. People don't need a certificate in childcare to look after a toddler for a few hours. Plenty of 14 year old girls baby sit for much longer just fine. OP is just lazy and playing up his incompetence to get out of being a team player. If he were my son I'd be disappointed cause Id raised a selfish asshole.", "Probably at the hospital with the sister. \nIt sounds like the baby came super early- and with a second kid, they may not have made super advance plans for a babysitter. And with early preemies, that might mean pre-eclampsia. Both the baby\u2019s father and the mom likely needed to be there to make medical decisions.", "- He*\n- At the hospital \n\n\nGuess we\u2019re not that dumb, eh?", "Birth doesn't wait for a baby sitter to arrive. No telling how early this baby was, genuinely who has time to go through babysitters while in labor or while supporting someone in labor?", "Hes 17 its not his responsibility to watch any kid unless it was his own child he created. All his family decided to go, One of them couldve watched neice", "NAH the kid isnt an obligatory babysitter just because \u201cfamily.\u201d They dont feel comfortable with babies and they properly expressed that. Family ignored that. Plans or not, thats more than enough justification for OP to have stood their ground", "it was an emergency? wdym?", "My brother wouldn't have any idea how to take care of my 2 year old daughter, and he's 10 years older than OP. If I didn't have anyone else I'd leave her with him because he'd stop her drowning or burning the house down, but he'd be severely overwhelmed. He wouldn't refuse if it were an emergency either though...", "No matter what the emergency, I wouldn't be leaving my kid with someone who doesn't want to look after them and doesn't know how to look after them.\n\nWhat if the 2yo has an allergy OP doesn't know about and gives them that food? Kids life's at stake.\nWhat if the 2yo falls and bumps its head and OP doesn't know the correct procedure and let's it go for a nap? Kids life could be at stake.\n\nStop being so judgemental with your caps and snarky remarks - OP mom being at the hospital would have made no difference is the sister or babys life was at stake, emotional support would not have made a blind bit of difference.", "I think the grandmother is the one to blame for raising the mom to be an asshole expecting anyone uncomfortable with a toddler to watch the toddler. If the kid was 6, yeah, the OTHER KID would wlbe the asshole. But this was bullshit that the KID is getting in trouble because he wasn't comfortable watching a toddler. Forcing that can actually be dangerous tlfor the younger kid.", "No idea what to do... It's easy enough a 12yo can do it with no help or experience at all, he's 17.", "Sounds like it wasn't regular labor, maybe really early labor. He said was an emergency.", "Agree", "But to be fair, if something would go wrong they would blame her for everything.\n\nForcing to watch someone's child is never okay, even in an \"emergency\", but in this specific situation it wasn't one.\n\nI'm a mother and i would never force someone to watch my child. It's my responsibility, not theirs.", "I'm sure there's a YouTube about it.", "Preach", "By 17 anyone should know how to do the bare minimum care of a kid. Idk if that\u2019s a hot take, I don\u2019t think it should be.", "No kidding. Don\u2019t know how to change a diaper? Google it. \n\nYTA", "I hope you don\u2019t have a 2 year old if you\u2019d trust them to a teenager with no experience for an unpredictable amount of time.", "Dude seriously? It was an emergency. Have you ever given birth? Do you know how scary it is to go into premature labor? Being available in an emergency is what being family is all about", "Maybe she needed her mom there for support while giving birth\u2026.", "Family doesnt show up to the hospital to assist with delivery\u2026", "The hard hitting questions.", "All you have to do is keep the kid alive. It is not hard. She went into labor early. It does not specify how early. It could be 20 weeks early. I know damn well I didn't have everything nailed down at 20 weeks. Emergencies happen and family is supposed to help. She is 17 not 7.", "This wasn\u2019t a random toddler but OPs niece. I would expect a 17 boy (almost old enough to leave home) to step up for a family emergency.

I have a large family so was always around babies/kids, but I also had friends who were from families where their parents were only children, and all their friends were of similar ages, so they literally grew up never even holding a baby til in their 20's.", "Yes exactly YTA. They had a rare emergency and OP should look out for others especially when their plans were not as important.", "He was there with my sister", "He really is tbh. I hope his sister and mother start treating him like the trash he is.", "I mean, easy there. I agree he was selfish and he\u2019s in the wrong but we\u2019re talking about a 17 year old kid. Teenagers are inherently selfish and are learning, and they also may take whatever people say here to heart. Words have more impact than we think, especially for 17 year olds.", "This was an emergency, not a Tuesday book club meeting.", "Who was supposed to watch the kid during childbirth. YTA if it was an emergency, but if they planned this the whole time without telling you then NTA.", "Or a teenager in 2023 or anything", "90% of the time the man dosent do shit. They just sit around and are in the way. There is only need for one emotional support person so ops sister could've chosen dad or grandma. You dont need a freaking audience to watch your cooter open. The notion that everyone needs to see the baby as soon as it slides out is weird and creepy. If she has to has to have the dad there then grandma can stay home and babysit", "That's a fact, but wasn't her mom there like if she needed help couldn't she have asked?", "[deleted]", "By that token, its not the family's responsibility to provide him anything more than the bare minimum for survival. Living rent free and being fed shouldn't come without some expectations of reciprocity. Your attitude is how you raise spoiled brats like OP.", "Hes 17 living at home. His responsibilities are whatever his mom says they are.", "He wasn\u2019t being asked to babysit while his sister went to the mall. She was literally giving birth.", "So what would you say if the mom kicks OP out once they turn 18? \n\nFamily is a two way street but reddit loves to promote contention amongst family.", "Yes he would. That's bs. Sincerely someone who in an was left just like this in an emergency at 15 I'd never even saw a diaper changed before and did just fine.", "This is a lot of hypotheticals - when really the fact that OPs mom was confident enough or the situation emergent enough to want to leave the 2 year with OP is more telling than of your hypotheticals.", "Surely if any of this happened, OP could have contacted his family for advice?", "I still don\u2019t understand why there wasn\u2019t a plan on who would watch her kid when she went into labor. Early or not", "I generally don't try to second-guess parents when they decide who is and is not capable of caring for their children. OP's attitude seems disingenuous, but her sister thinks she's able to watch the niece.\n\nIf this were a story from one of the adults' perspectives with different context, it might be a different response.", "A 17 year old is more than capable of caring for a toddler. Also i doubt we\u2019re getting the full story here.", "I helped take care of my siblings and baby sat when I was 13. OP has no excuse. He coulda googled how to babysit a 2 year old. What to feed a 2 year old. How to change a diaper etc. he just decided to be selfish", "That\u2019s exactly why she would have needed her mum there. This commentator is probably quite wet behind the ears in regards to this subject", "Someone may have to make difficult medical decisions if the expectant mother becomes incapacitated. Her mother is her next of kin.", "Good enough. Your mom needed to stay with the kid. You don\u2019t leave a toddler with a teenage boy who has no idea what to do. If they wanted you to be their babysitter, they had many months to prepare you. If you agreed to it. That grounding is bogus.", "Nope, sorry. It was just a birth, not a serious car accident.\nYou can give birth without the grandmother and have still nurses and everything else you might need for the situation in the hospital.\n\nThere is no need to have here there.", "I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking here? The mom ended up having to stay home with the niece because OP bailed.", "And what makes you so sure?", "Still something he expressed discomfort for yet was forced into the duty regardless. Most would understand that alone. \nI mean its pretty irresponsible to give a job to someone who says they are bad at said job. Infant childcare isn\u2019t exactly a chore.", "Sure, kick him out. IDGAF \n\nIn this hypothetical world we\u2019ve created\u2026 the kid has his boundaries, the parents have their boundaries. If those boundaries clash and parents don\u2019t want it in their house, turn legal adult they have the right to boot him.", "yeah diapers are a bit gross but its really not rocket science. He's been wiping his own ass for over a decade, im sure he can figure out how to wipe someone elses.

Or at work where they can't call off? This was an emergency, way earlier than anyone was expecting. \n\nNo one plans to go into premature labor.", "Because emergencies happen.", "Exactly. I'd trust my 12yo son to do so. And in fact he's done the babysitting course.", "Baby daddy was there.", "OR just maybe help family out when there\u2019s an emergency.", "This is a morals sub.

Also given how apathetic OP is about this birth, do you think hed even know?", "Maybe they did. But maybe they didn\u2019t.

Is it all sorted out? Or would it be a surprise?\n\nIt was *unexpected* for it to be happening at this time.
