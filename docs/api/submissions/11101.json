The sister probably hadn't gotten around to putting together her hospital plan yet", "Yes her birth plan should have included someone on standby 24 hours a day for an \"early and unexpected\" birth. Another fantastic idea from Captain Hindsight!!", "A 17yo should absolutely be able to keep a 2yo alive and well with minimum supervision for 24 hours. Hell if I went to a niece or nephew of mine now that's around that age and give them my 9 week old daughter and a diaper bag I fully expect them to be able to cope.\n\nHaving a standby baby sitter 24/7 in the 2 weeks before pregnancy is something entitled people like you, me, and my wife can do but my family certainly can't afford that and if they had asked me I'd of bitched but also I'd of watched my cousin.", "Including \"early and unexpected\" births, there is a 15+ week window for viable births. It's reasonable to expect someone to have a solid plan for births that happen on or near the due date. Expecting them to have a perfect plan that can be executed flawlessly at a moment's notice 24 hours a day for 15 weeks is not reasonable.", "A 17 year old is very safely capable of watching a kid, legally and practically. \u201cKnows how to watch a kid\u201d\u2026.they are a 17 year old human being. The idea this is some sort of safety hazard or dangerous imposition is bizarre.", ">im sure he can figure out how to wipe someone elses. Unless his mum still does this for him too\n\nLOL for this part here", "and if he reaaaaallly can't? it's on youtube, wikihow, etc.", "Exactly, a 2 month old i would have been more fainted by but a 2 year old? That's simple. 15yo me had to watch a 2yo nephew and i even changed a diaper having never even seen one changed before that. Gave him some canned spaghetti Os for food. Easy peasy.", "Tf went on with your generation to make it so you watched 7 kids most likely not much younger than you.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t want to call OP an a-hole because shit. People make it seem like taking care of a 2 year old isn\u2019t hard when it is. I have seen it first hand. OP has zero experience babysitting so if something were to happen, what the hell do they expect him to do?\n\nETA: it also depends on how the child is/behaves. Some children are not easy to watch/take care of while some are", "It\u2019s not always that simple. Babysitters can be arranged in advance, but if things go fast and furious ahead of schedule plenty can change and it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. Your backup childcare might be sick/out of town etc. because they aren\u2019t putting their life on hold for the last five weeks of a pregnancy, and/or mom might need to go by ambulance and need someone at her home immediately, instead of driving older sibling to a babysitter\u2019s house, and/or something may have gone wrong and mom needs more or different support people at the hospital who were originally signed up to be childcare during a more predictable/typical labor situation. There definitely should\u2019ve been a plan in place (and there might have been), but it also definitely doesn\u2019t mean this situation wouldn\u2019t have still presented itself if there was.", "Toddlers can wreak more havoc than any infant.    \n\n\nI still remember my nephew at the top of a straight flight of stairs trying to climb the baby gate at the top of the stairs.    \n\n\nMe \"Wait right there.\" in the calmest voice I could manage.  Bolting up the stairs to grab him.  \n\n\nI'd been cooking dinner and his Grandmother had eyes on him - until she didn't.... took 30 seconds for him to be hanging 10 off the gate.    \n\n\nProbably broke some land speed records though?", "Even with a comprehensive birth plan, for an unexpectedly early birth, which seems like it's the case here, the planned sitter and even the back up sitter can't necessarily be in place immediately. If it's a friend or relative, they might need to arrange to take leave from work, or change the leave they've already booked in. For a professional sitter, unless you're paying them to be on call, they'll be free to work other jobs and won't automatically be available then and there.", "This. I went into labor 3 weeks early and had my contractions begin in earnest in the middle of Walmart the day after Thanksgiving. I was not expecting to have a baby that day at all. It was all I could do to leave that store and getting to the ER.", "I'm saying that there was more than enough time to teach the OP how to do the basics in looking after the baby.\n\nThe window is large, sure, but they should have known that they'd have to leave the baby with the OP in the event of an emergency and prepared them for that.", "Exactly. My mom was supposed to watch my toddler when I go into labor with my second child. She was on vacation when I was 8 months pregnant. Had I gone into premature labor, she would not have been available and I'd have to figure out something else."]}
