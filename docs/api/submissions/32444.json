Not saying lie but rather anticipate she\u2019s going to ask you again (and again and again) if she looks fat in something.

Unfortunately there wasn't really a way for you to be right", "ESH - but for different reasons and for reasons that I don't necessarily agree with, let me explain.\n\nFirst off, you're both 18 and have very little relationship experience in the grand scheme of things, so understand that it's okay to make mistakes like this as long as you know how to vome back from this. \n\nLet's start with what you did, which was telling the truth and making sure of it. Very honest of you, and you should be proud of that part of yourself. However, sometimes people ask questions and they're not looking for the answer to the question they're asking. She didn't want to know of she looked fat or not, she was feeling insecure about the way the dress looked and was looking for reassurance. Next time, here's how you handle it 'first off you're NOT fat, and you ARE beautiful. When I saw you in that dress I felt (tell her a good thing you felt).' then kiss her passionately or something and see if that does it. It won't for some. If after that she asks more probing questions about how the dress looks on her, you're gonna need to approach it from the perspective of \"All human bodies are normal and the way people look on media is not real life\". For instance, you can be thin as hell but when you crouch down to grab something your gut still bunches out, totally normal and it happens to literally everyone. Tread carefully and maybe lead with \"I don't know much about fashion and I've never done this before so please understand that I'm doing my best to fulfill your wishes\". \n\nHope that helps you show empathy and dance inside the goofy social bullshit that society teaches us.\n\nSpeaking of bullshit society stuff, let's talk about why she's also an asshole here. Women are taught/shown from a very young age that appearance is important. It comes from every angle, from family, friends, strangers, TV, social media, everywhere. It's brutal. I think that more young people are aware of the issues this causes than ever before, but awareness of an issue is just the first step in fighting it. She wants to feel pretty in her dress, but isn't used to wearing that kind of clothing and is feeling insecure because she's comparing the shape of her body in the mirror to the people she's seen wearing that type of dress that photoshop their photos taken with special lenses that are NOT how the human eye sees. Then in some kind of emotional state she turned to you and asked a direct question about what she was concerned about. There is no correct answer to that question, OP. They know what their body looks like and they know what they're comparing it to and they know when you're lying. The question itself is flawed as well because it sets up a false premise on several levels. She asked it the DRESS made her LOOK fat, not if she was fat. She then got mad that you had to check so her understanding of the question is that if you have to check that means you're saying she's fat. Illogical, but thats what emotion and insecurity can do to your perspective. Secondly, the premise of the question is still about the dress itself, and you are correct to scrutinize how the dress looks on a person, doing so is a service to the person asking as sometimes we have trouble seeing ourselves objectively. My wife is 5'0\" and most dresses look awful on her because she's so damn short. She doesn't ask me about how the shape looks on her, she can see it herself. She asks about my general opinion so we discuss how certain colors are more suitable for her skin/hair tones vs others. But again, your gf wasn't asking about the dress, and she's an asshole for not communicating directly about what she's thinking, and instead following social scripts that she's seen in media, and being upset about the answer she received because it was not only NOT what she wanted to hear, it also wasn't an answer to what she was actually asking. She may be aware of this on some level, which would only amplify her emotions because of the cognitive dissonance.\n\nAnyways, short answer is ESH because of society, not because either of you necessarily suck.", "Watch this video it's the perfect answer to your question https://youtube.com/shorts/HeB0vk8Q-vk?si=GFEJg9expPpO7oUR", "next time you know not to answer stupid questions. yta", "NTA - *but*.\n\nSo if my wife asks me that, I will just straight up ask if she wants validation/compliments or outfit advice. Both are sensible things for her to want, and I need to be able to give either, and the two of us (*being a team*) need to communicate as to which one she needs right now.\n\nIn this case you thought your girlfriend wanted advice, but maybe she actually wanted validation. She might dislike either the dress or more likely something about herself, and need you to reassure her (because people are a terrible judge of their own appearance) that this worry was nothing. This dislike may have been strong enough that she found the initial compliment hard to believe and asked for another.\n\nShe needs to learn to believe you when you compliment her and you need to learn how she asks for support and how she'd like it provided. This is normal.\n\n(From my wife, a request for a second compliment after I've given her one already means something else is actively wrong, and I'd respond by stopping whatever I was doing and fault-finding with her.
