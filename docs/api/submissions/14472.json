Shouldn't have had this conversation before date night...pretty much ruined. But she tells me that she is experiencing feelings of doubt in trusting things I said because I tell white lies. Nothing serious but little things. Like I lied to some hotel staff so she could go to the bathroom, or lied to the airplane hostess so I could get an extra soda. And she is like seeing those is damaging. \"Your best self is someone that doesn't lie\". I'm of the opinion that people lie when they are uncomfortable. Her best friend just lied to their other friend because she wasn't comfortable sharing her relationship drama yet. But she also said her best friend has a zero tolerance lie policy. to me that makes her friend a hypocrite and it makes my GF naive. People lie. Lies are tools. Just because I use that tool in certian situations doesn't mean you can't trust me. I know my parents have lied, my advisor lies, EVERYONE LIES when it suits them, it doesn't mean you have to spend every second doubting what people are saying. And I shared these things with her. She now thinks I don't care about her. I'm like it's ridiculous to promise I'd never lie about anything in life ever so she can trust me. That shit is unrealistic and naive.

Not everyone lies, some people can communicate without lying but can still maintain boundaries when it comes to revealing personal information.

And the fact that she used the hotel bathroom is irrelevant. She can have mixed feelings about that scenario, or she may have just been uncomfortable and not sure what to do in the moment. To me the issue is not those two specific examples, it's that she can see a pattern of lying and when you explain it you don't assuage any of those concerns.

It is a bad character flaw, and one that it seems you want to try and deflect to others. Yes, everyone lies once and a while, but you should never try to incorporate lies into your life as a \"tool\". Lies to spare someone's feelings are sometimes understandable, but lying to get an extra soda? You are being deceitful when doing things like that and saying I will say whatever I have to to get what I want. I do not blame her, as your reply to her if you really cared about her and were an emotionally mature person would have been \"You are right, I know I have an issue with lying.

You are needlessly \"white lying\" to get through life.  It's not \"naive\" for your girlfriend to think that if you pointlessly/compulsively lie to people to get little things, you are lying to her. (You know, you can just walk into a hotel and say \"Hey where's the bathroom?\" or ask a flight attendant for another drink, you don't need to lie).\n\n\\^ For the record, I had a friend in your girlfriend's position who found out her husband led a whole double life w/ a girlfriend in another city that he'd regularly take \"business trips\" to see, diverted some of his pay to a private bank account he'd use to fund these trips etc etc, and she says \"I knew he lied to other people to get what he wanted, but never thought he'd lie to me.\" \n\nIf you aren't hiding anything and love your gf, go to therapy. \n\nYTA", "YTA \nIf you willingly and easily lie about things that don't matter, how can you be trusted with things that do matter.", "First of all, hotels have bathrooms in the lobby and you can just go in and use them\u2026 for future reference, so you don\u2019t have to lie needlessly.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to side with your gf and say YTA here. If she sees you telling lies often, then it\u2019s not an issue of a little white lie here or there, it becomes a question of if you\u2019re a pathological liar. If you tell lies needlessly then one has to question *why* you\u2019re doing it. You\u2019ve said a few times that \u201cpeople lie when they\u2019re uncomfortable\u201d, that\u2019s a very generalized statement and not one I\u2019ve found to be true. I think what you really mean is *you* lie when *you\u2019re* uncomfortable. That would give me pause if I was your gf. \n\nLying when uncomfy shows that you are 1. Unable to handle conflict in a mature manner & 2. Willing to be dishonest to get out of a situation you don\u2019t like. Neither of those are good traits in a partner. It shows a lack of maturity, self awareness and conflict resolution skills. Which are all important traits if you want to have a relationship. So what you see as a minor thing is actually a red flag for a much bigger issue. \n\nPlus if you\u2019re willing to lie about little things to avoid conflict, then you will definitely lie to avoid conflict in bigger issues (which will inevitably arise in any long term relationship), and that\u2019s not something anyone wants in a partner.", "Info: what were the lies?", "Uhhh\u2026 being suspicious of someone that compulsively lies is almost the exact opposite of naive. \nYTA", "YTA.

The jump to calling her naive because of a difference in opinion makes it seems like you don\u2019t respect this person or their judgement/intelligence very much. I personally don\u2019t have a problem with OCCASIONAL white lies like you used as examples but I completely understand why someone would. She\u2019s not naive for having different values/problems with trust and communicating them to you. \n\nAs for her friend, shes not apart of the relationship so I don\u2019t see much relevance anyway but she\u2019s not obligated to tell people about her \u201cdrama.\u201d I have a personal policy to be nice to people. Sometimes I have a hard time and am not as nice to someone as I could\u2019ve been. People make mistakes.

He ended up in treatment by 35yo for pathological lying. It got to the point where he lied about everything, even when it was easier and more beneficial to tell the truth.

You\u2019re still going overboard.\n\nEdit: Are you actual adults?", "YTA for making lying seem more normal than it is.  Yes I agree everyone lies to an extent, but it\u2019s more complicated than that. \n\nFor instance - I lied to my kids, I told them Santa bought them stockings and the tooth fairy wrote wee notes for them and took their teeth.  So that was a lie.  However as soon as they asked me outright I told them the truth, mainly because I\u2019m crap at lying and just could never have lied to their faces like that.  The initial lie never sat well with me, but I remember loving the magic of Santa and the tooth fairy so wanted them to feel that too.\n\nGenerally I don\u2019t lie, I can\u2019t, I forget what I\u2019ve said and would tie myself up in knots, as well as just giving a lie away as soon as I\u2019ve told it because my face gives me away.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m very straight forward and need to know that I can trust what people tell me.

You're not lying because you're in an uncomfortable situation like GF's best friend, you're lying for your own advantage.

Your examples aren't white lies (intended to avoid harm), they are just lies. \n\nNot everyone would lie in those circumstances. She's right to be concerned.", "A white lie isn\u2019t something you use to manipulate a situation to get free shit. \n\nYou\u2019re not trustworthy. Look at what you wrote dude.

Ironically this is the thing most people have the hardest time believing, but I'm very straight - especially with partners. I tell them if they ask something that I don't want to answer (for whatever reason), I either change the subject, or tell them point blank that I'm not answering their question. That also includes those \"little white lies\" that some people make when trying to do something nice, like trying to arrange surprise parties/gifts etc. You can still do that while being truthful", "NTA- just creepy.", "YTA. Your attitude toward the truth is very concerning. If your girlfriend is smart, she will get out of this relationship fast. By your own admission, you have no qualms about lying if you think it will get you something. If that's your attitude, why wouldn't you lie to her? You would and probably have.", "Okay, so, this is a hard one.  If you're being honest about only lying about these minor things, then I'll take it at face value and approach it from that angle.\n\nNow, you and she clearly have a different idea of when it is valid to lie.  Lies should be avoided if possible, but there are indeed cases that can be argued.  You are getting defensive about it though.  Just because Billy stole a bag of chips and got views on tiktok about it doesn't mean you still won't get in trouble if you steal chips.  There are people out there who will applaud the worst behavior in the world.  You can't use that as a rubric of why you shouldn't be accountable for your actions.\n\nThat said, the issue is that she isn't comfortable with someone who lies casually.  It doesn't matter if everyone lies at some point, this isn't the issue.  You're obfuscating the matter.  This is between her and you.  Full stop.  She does not feel comfortable with casual lying and you do not see an issue with it.  Claims that she's naive and stuff isn't going to make her any more comfortable with the idea.  She may have had issues with liars in the past that have deeply affected her.  Maybe you lie more than you notice.  Maybe she is reading too much into it.  Couples therapy can potentially help.  It's not an accusation, it's mediation.\n\nWhat it comes down to is this.  She is deeply uncomfortable with casual lying and she cannot trust you if she feels you don't take honesty seriously.  If she doesn't trust you, she may be unwilling to continue the relationship.  You feel she is doubting you as a person over something you consider very minor and are upset she would think you would deceive her.  This is frustrating for both of you.  So what is the solution?  You can love someone and still have differences in opinion or values that make a relationship untenable.  So this requires open, serious communication.  Is this a dealbreaker for the two of you if it can't be resolved?  If it isn't, can you find a way to talk to each other and come to an understanding?  Would a mediator be helpful in doing that?\n\nIf I'm taking your story at face value, even though I think I too would feel a little sketch about your ideas about lies as tools to get what you want, I'll say NAH.  This is a relationship speedbump, and the test is how the two of you handle it together.", "YTA. I do agree, lots of people lie for many different reasons. Heck, with my anxiety, I lie and say I watched a movie when there\u2019s a social conversation going on and people are talking about the movie because I panic and suck at normal conversation. I question your lying habits when you lie to get extra soda.", "ESH\n\nLook, I agree with you about white lies. People lie to get through life safely. I lied this morning that I was \u201cwaiting for a friend\u201d because I didn\u2019t want a strange man to join me at my table. Lying is not always wrong.\n\nBut your partner clearly feels like the lines between small lies and big lies is blurred. You also shouldn\u2019t white lie to your partner, imo basically ever.

Like her house has 2 acres when it has less than 1, the cost of her house when she shared the listing for it before she bought it showing she clearly paid less.  It is a personal pet peeve of mine.  Her husband just sits there when she does this.  I wonder what he really thinks about her lying?  Because I wouldn't be with someone like that.  I think you lie a lot for it to bother her.

So ask yourself, is getting that free soda really worth damaging your relationship?", "Question, did she use the hotel bathroom?", "Bro lying for your own benefit is hella corrupt thinking", "YTA.  You seem to be a habitual liar and these are not white lies that you are telling. If I was your GF I'd have a hard time trusting anything you said too.", "YTA - You\u2019re focusing on the wrong thing here.

Proving that you\u2019re objectively \u201cright\u201d isn\u2019t going to save your relationship. Your girlfriend isn\u2019t feeling secure in your relationship, and she\u2019s offered you a way to regain her trust (couples therapy). All you have to do is decide if you\u2019re going to go with her and try to salvage your relationship, or break up with her. If you\u2019re not willing to listen to her and say, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make objective sense to me, but I understand that it\u2019s important to you so let\u2019s work on it,\u201d you don\u2019t stand a chance.", "YTA.\n\nMost people lie in at least some circumstances.  But what your girlfriend seems to be saying, which I think everybody in this comment section seems to be echoing, is that you're not making any attempt to articulate when you consider it to be morally permissible to lie, and when you don't.  Which makes it impossible for her to trust you.  Because there are things we don't mind being lied to about (\"I'm so sorry I'm late, did I inconvenience you?\") and things that we deeply mind about being lied to about (\"Did you cheat on me?\").  Knowing what you think is morally ok to lie about, and knowing how strongly you adhere to those morals is what allows you to trust.\n\nSo, for example, I'll absolutely lie if I think it is what everybody involved would want.  Like when my neighbor asks me if I liked the cookies she baked, but I never ate them because I'm on a diet, but I know my wife loved them.  There's no benefit to her from hearing the truth there, and if I just say they were amazing and thank her profusely, she feels good about doing a good deed, my wife gets cookies, and I don't have to break my diet.\n\nOr, I believe it's morally reasonable to lie to get out of a situation where you're being mistreated by somebody who doesn't deserve your honesty.  Like when some scary dude is following you home and is demanding to know why you won't stop and talk to him, it's totally reasonable to say \"Because my boyfriend is expecting me to get home on time!\"\n\nBut I don't believe it's morally reasonable to lie to a person you love to avoid conflict with them.  Even if you're feeling uncomfortable, I think that if a person you love has always made it clear to you that they want the truth even if it hurts them, and demonstrated to you that they always take negative feedback gracefully and kindly, you owe it to them to be honest with them even if you're scared.\n\nSo when you say things like \"everybody lies when it suits them\" it makes your girlfriend think that you could lie to her about anything that suits you.  That's a thing that rightfully makes her feel scared.\n\nPeople don't have to always be honest and never lie in order to trust them, but you have to know what they're willing to lie about.  I know my wife struggles giving people honest feedback.  Sometimes she'll lie and say she likes something even when she doesn't (and so do I!).  So I don't trust her to give me honest feedback.  If I want honest feedback on something that could hurt my feelings, she's not the one I'm going to ask.  But I do trust her never to take advantage of me, to lie to me to trick me into doing something for her that I wouldn't want to do if she told the truth.  And that trust is possible, because I've never seen my wife lie to trick another person into doing something for her.\n\nYour girlfriend has seen you lie to trick people into doing things for you that they otherwise wouldn't have wanted to do.  So now she knows she can not trust you not to trick her into doing something she doesn't want to do.", "I told my boss I was working remotely (which I had permission to do) in a different city than where I actually was", "> EVERYONE LIES when it suits them.\n\nOkay, Machiavelli.", "You openly admit that you're dishonest anytime it benefits you.

I've responded to a lot of comments. And while some of you have good points. Some of you must live on a different planet than I do. I DO NOT LIE TO HARM ANYONE ELSE. So to be clear my lies were literally harmless. And yet every is trying to make it seem like because you would lie about a harmless thing you would automatically lie about something that is harmful. Which to me is just an incredible argument to make. Guns are tools. Just because someone owns one and knows how to use them doesn't mean that they are going to then go out and internationally harm people. And going out to shoot cans in the woods doesn't mean I'm willing to harm people. So replace guns with lies. A lot of people have and use them. And that doesn't mean that those people are out to harm anyone. Nor should they be treated as such. I'm also kind of astounded by the people talking in here who speak like they have never EVER lied to get anything. Again not to cause harm. But to get anything ever. Like I'm not trying to say you should be out here lying everyday or cheating on your girl or anything like that....but to argue from the position that lies are to never be used........it seems like a lot of you don't practice what you preach cause if the world was as honest as y'all are typing it out to be we'd be in a much much better place than we are.

Lying for your own sake is selfish...  which is why OP's girlfriend is starting to wonder about him.", "But your examples in (answering fine, tooth fairy, santa) are all still lying to people to get things from them that you want. That is always the purpose of lying. You want the other person to not be aware of a truth that you hold, therefore granting you the power to manipulate that specific dynamic and/or individual situation to your will. \n\nYour purpose for said manipulation is the real moral conundrum you should be worrying about.", "I'm wondering exactly how often the OP lies. Maybe he doesn't see it as frequent or serious, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't a problematic behavior. \n\nI mean, if someone blatantly tells me they have no problem with lying for their own benefit and convenience, why should I believe them when they tell me nothing they're lying about is a big deal? Trust is an easy thing to lose, especially if the people involved don't agree on what's a \"serious\" lie.", "In my experience most of their time with the cases like being able to pee or a soda, telling the truth and being nice will get you what you want/need. I know I\u2019m much more willing to help someone in a situation like that if someone just tells the truth, I might do it even if I\u2019m being lied to, but I\u2019m likely to know when that\u2019s the case and I\u2019ll be bitter about it", "Right?

They aren't always malicious. \n\nAlso I would absolutely lie and say I'm staying in a hotel to pee in their lobby bathroom, what does it cost them?

Jog home at full speed and hope for the best?", "If I really had to pee, I\u2019d appreciate any lie my bf could tell that would get me access to a hotel bathroom.  Sooooo, I have to disagree there.", "Likely would have had to pay for it, if it was on an airline. Doesn't excuse it.

The white lie of \"I'm fine\" lets them get their headspace organized so that they *can* talk about it if the need is there.", "Maybe it\u2019s not even that, but like.

Social lies.", "I never said I like to lie. I said lying is morally neutral.

Is there any person to whom you wouldn't lie?\n\nFinally, it is obvious to almost every single person here why your girlfriend doesn't trust you.  She's right not to - because from what you've said, you wouldn't think twice about lying about an affair, or an addiction, or financial irresponsibility - to you, it seems like the lie would just be a tool to make things easier.", "Not the person you replied to, but I\u2019m not conventionally attractive at all, but still haven\u2019t encountered any problems asking for some extra things on a flight or to use a restroom at a cafe or hotel.

Are these the people you wanna group yourself with?", "You\u2019re a hypocrite. You say lies are like a tool while you use that tool in ways that gets you what you want.\n\nI understand lying to save someone ass, lying because of the drama or lying because you don\u2019t feel comfortable.

In most cases, lying is considered to be morally wrong because it involves intentionally deceiving someone. Lying for personal gain (e.g. a soda) is not morally neutral.\n\nThere are some situations where lying might be morally justifiable, such as when the lie is told to protect someone from harm, to prevent a greater evil, or to protect someone's privacy or dignity. \n\nSome philosophers, like Immanuel Kant believed that lying is always morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances. In his ethical theory, lying is considered to be a violation of the categorical imperative, which is the principle that we should always treat others as ends in themselves and never merely as means to our own ends.", "She must be lying to you when she it\u2019s important to her and needs to be addressed.", "... and doing so is a huge problem that no one condones.

People steal from Walmart and if I was a worker, I wouldn\u2019t blink an eye. Why? Because they\u2019re rich and still profiting regardless. Stealing from a small business? That\u2019s messed up.
