His controlling ways were only going to get worse. I'm proud of you for keeping your standards so early. \nNTA", "Nah you underreacted.

Yelling and calling you names for playing an online game with someone, who frankly is not even guaranteed to be a guy - after all, just because their online persona gives one impression does not mean it isn't a false impression.\n\nAt least it only took you 2 months to respond to the red flags, if it hadn't been for the game you were playing the other day you might have spent more time with the guy before the straw broke the camel's back.", "Yeah, keep him blocked.

It means he\u2019ll feel like he can do disrespectful hurtful things to you and you should take it because he\u2019s the man and you\u2019re a woman.

You are young and susceptible to this utter bs. Do your older self a favor and focus on you. Don\u2019t risk getting stuck with a guy like this you deserve much much better. Always run whenever anyone talks about someone else\u2019s value. These men see relationships as transactional instead of a partnership. Your value in a relationship isn\u2019t what you can provide sexually or as domestic work. Run from anyone who uses that kind of language. A relationship is a partnership. What each person brings to the relationship is companionship, emotional support, and love.", "Some folks excel at spinning crap like that in order to feel superior/powerful and make other's doubt themselves.

A pencil that's been sharpened too much will be practically unusable after a while, will become trash.

You can tell, because they work just fine without a key.", "where do you go to see game logs?   \ngenuinely this stuff is beyond me lol", "So lets say we take an example game League of Legends: If she left her game signed in and running then walked away to grab a drink or go to the washroom it would not take very much effort at all for her boyfriend to click to a tab to see match history.\n\nIn most competitive games where you team up with other teammates match history would also show the names of players on both teams including additional info on what role they were playing etc.\n\nIf the ex went on discord or some other chat/messaging program and found that they were planning to form a team then saw game logs where she was teamed up with 1 person repeatedly he can put two and two together to figure out she was playing with the same person.\n\nAt this point I would also like to acknowledge the fact that yes going through all this just to figure out your partner was playing video games with someone of the opposite gender is very controlling and irrational behavior.\n\nTL;DR: Most games where you team up to compete competitively keeps match history and game logs in-game."]}
