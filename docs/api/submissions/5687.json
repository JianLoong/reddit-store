Everyone is an asshole some of the time, but there is always that family member who goes above and beyond.

I'm a Colts fan, I love it.", "NTA\n\nI mean according to [this](https://nameberry.com/babyname/indie/girl) Indie is a real name, but there is also expressing concern and then just being rude. I think it's fine for SIL to express concern, but she was just being rude. I have a family member who has a name similar (two letters off) and that name seems even rarer than Indie, and is also a real name.", "NTA - start badgering your SIL about her kids\u2019 names. About how unoriginal and stifling they are. It\u2019s possible they will be mixed up with all of the other kids with the same names, so no one will remember them. Two can play her game.

She brought this up out of no where. She sounds like she just like to start drama. Indie is a beautiful name- and is honestly not \u201cweird\u201d at all.

NTA and its not a bad name. no one will think twice about it.", ">She said to both of us that I was too rude to her and acted like she wasn't our daughter's aunt, which I never said.\n\nI suggest telling her that if she continues to make rude comments about your daughter's name, she will be an aunt \"in name only\", since you don't want your daughter exposed to people who are full of negativity and who also can't model good behavior.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. Your daughter has a great name. Even if she didn\u2019t, how the hell is it anyone else\u2019s business? She\u2019s your child.

One of the secondary characters are named Indie (or Indy). It's none of her business what you named your child. She's just pissed she has no imagination & is taking it out on you. It's a cute name. I knew an Indy once, named after Indiana Jones, she was the coolest kid at that school. Nta.", "Obviously NTA. A unique name is better than a bland name that every second child has. Kids will tease no matter what the name. As an adult, a unique name can be (but I know not always) an advantage 'cause it makes one stand out from the crowd in a good way.", "NTA if she didn't want that kind of reaction she shouldn't be such an asshole about something that doesn't even concern her. And if she behaves like that in such a way she better have a thick enough skin to accept the reactions that people give her.", "[removed]", "I personally don't think that Indie is a bad name at all, but in this example, shouldn't someone have said something to the parent who makes their kid some weird symbol or Abcde instead of saddling their kid with a ghastly name.
