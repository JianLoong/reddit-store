What you name your child is your business and your SIL is a loudmouth, overbearing jerk!", "NTA. Indie is extremely normal compared to just s few of the ones I\u2019ve come across personally. I wish could say it\u2019s a joke but I really do know someone named Cola. Another was named Etois, they said it was pronounced Etoy but they weren\u2019t sure so they just called her Buddy.", "Came to say NTA and not just because that is literally my nieces first name. And it\u2019s not a nickname. Her name is Indie Ana Olivia Jones. She kinda hates it that everyone makes a reference to a movie she will probably never watch. But strange names run in the family. Plus, if she wanted to say something about it, it\u2019s WAY too late. You and your husband have every right to stand up for YOUR DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR CHILD. \n\nYour SIL is a real AH for taking it as far as she did especially with your daughter there and discussing it after you left with the other family members. Only AH like to hurt feelings and be immature about things that have nothing to do with them.", "NTA \n\nThere is a TV show called \"How to be Indie\" where the main character's name is Indie and it came out in 2009, so... Not that bonkers of a name lol", "NTA, your SIL is a very strange woman.", "I didn't care if people liked the name or not, but if they pushed I would simply say, \"if you don't like the name, you're welcome to go have your own child and name them whatever you want.\" I especially said this to my MIL, and it was funny seeing her get flustered.", "Every time that Heffa opened her mouth I would shut her down. The nerve of her to try n tell someone else what to and not to name their baby. Mind Yo MF Business.", "For what it\u2019s worth I knew maybe three or four variations of the name \u201cindie\u201d growing up, in my small lil country town. I think it\u2019s a nice name", "How does she process people around her? Didn't she reach this developmental stage during adolescence where you realize people are not like you and may have different tastes and hold different values?\n\nSo story time : my cousines daughter poped out yesterday. We learned how she named her baby. It's kitch. English sounding. Not our culture. Very suburb. First reaction: ah no cringe!......  And then... nothing else. No one is ever gonna say anything ever again. \n\nTada! That's how you react to your family's naming game. Because it's none of your fucking business.", "Maybe but like once, nicely, in the form of \"are you suuuuure?\", and stfu after.", "Not to be argumentative, but Tammy is a legal name.  And there are many similar names that aren\u2019t \u201cshort\u201d for anything.", "Twins or Orangejello and Lemonjello.", "That\u2019s my nieces name like for real on her birth certificate.", "Ugh, I remember that one. He wanted Chewbacca, she wanted Rebecca, so they compromised. \ud83e\udd22", "Vader is an awesome name! No one's going to be giving her shit", "Same!", "I didn\u2019t see that one; what was she compromise??  Chewbecca?  Rebacca?", "Yeah, literally Chewbecca. It was several months ago, wouldn't even know how to track it down. \ud83d\ude02", "My friends named their boy Indy. I thought it was odd but didn\u2019t say anything of course cause we\u2019ll, it\u2019s not a big deal and none of my business. NTA", "NTA. And tell her she is damn right with that stinky loud mouth that doesn't have words go through her brain, she has no place to be an aunt.", "NTA. Clearly this oldest SIL doesn't understand boundaries and when one should just shut up.", "NTA.", "If she was just drunk and lost her filter I can understand, but to double triple down after with texting is sus. Something weird is up with her. Meaning it could be she just has a shit personality or she's got a bigger problem elsewhere and is weirdly focusing on this to ignore that problem or maybe she has an unexplainable aversion to the name. \n\nSomething is definitely off with that one. Weird hill to die on for something not quite related to her. NTA", "NTA. None of her business and it\u2019s a lovely name anyway. In the modern world jobs and businesses have people from all sorts of backgrounds and countries of origin. On a CV (resum\u00e9) the name is the literal last thing anyone cares about.", "NTA SIL is crazy Indie is a nice name.", "NTA maybe she is mad because it\u2019s a name she secretly likes and wanted to use", "My Daughters name is Indy, it's different and it's a beautiful name.", "We nearly named our daughter Indie (was top 3 choice) and I think it\u2019s a beautiful name.", "my cousins family are all named after star wars people. and another one is american cities. another one is directions (north south east west). another one is sports people. please send help for my family", "I mean Chewbacca is a strong name\u2026", "she\u2019d have a fun time in Germany considering \u201cVader\u201d means \u201cFather\u201d", "Haha it means father though"]}
