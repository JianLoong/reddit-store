Just tell her to be glad you didn't name your kid \"X \u00c6 A-12\" or something.", "NTA \n\nTelling someone to mind their own business was exactly what I would have said.

It's a cute name btw \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. You were very polite in the face of her inappropriate behaviour.

And a lot of names are odd before they become mainstream.

No one gets to name other people\u2019s children.  She sounds jealous to me.", "NTA. Quite right your daughters name is none of her business.

Your SIL should keep her opinions to herself and focusing on naming her own kids. \n\nAlso there\u2019s a character in bluey called indie, if your kids are anything like mine they will be onsessed with bluey in no time and probably low that a character shares their name", "NTA and SIL is nothing but a bully. \u201cMost Outspoken\u201d in this case is code for \u201cbiggest AH that for some reason everyone puts up with\u201d. \n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, Indie is a cute name, it\u2019s unusual but not weird and no one will think it\u2019s weird for a kid or an adult.", "NTA.

Hubs was John Michael, son is Sean Michael.", "NTA at all and it makes me sad that you are putting any blame on yourself for this situation. Your SIL was in the wrong period. Your child\u2019s name is literally none of her business and she can go pound sand. Stop responding to her or trying to defend yourself. You have nothing to apologize for in this situation.", "Here's something to blow your SIL's mind. Every name in the history of of human existence is made up, even *hers*.", "NTA , love indie 10/10", "*Really* depends on the name, and the context surrounding it. If I tried naming my kid Megatron, *that* would make me the A H, and it would not be assholish for relatives to call me out on it. If I named my kid *explicitly* after a celebrity, I should be called out for that. (I\u2019ve known multiple people who hated their celebrity names, including a \u201cmaiquel jackson\u201d who refused to go by anything except \u201cmiguel\u201d). If I gave my kid a \u201ccrunchy\u201d name, that should also be called out. \n\nAnd yeah, for loving family with the kid\u2019s best interests at heart, it really *should be* the aunt\u2019s business. Who else but aunts and uncles and grandparents are in a position to tell the parents if they\u2019ve made a mistake?\n\nThat said, if the name isn\u2019t *that* weird, and the relatives are forcing excessive normalcy, then that\u2019s when the parents should stand their ground.\n\n(That said, I do generally recommend against diminutives-as-names. If you want to call your kid Bobby, just name them Robert. That way they\u2019ll have a more commonly-respected legal name, and no one would bat an eye at them identifying by the common nickname.)\n\nI\u2019m not going to pass judgement on \u201cIndie\u201d. Just explaining how it\u2019s not necessarily *not* the extended family\u2019s business. Depending on the type of intervention, it\u2019s a *good thing* to have extended family willing to oppose the parents for the best interest of the child. This specific case may be too intrusive, but it also sounds like a reasonable good-faith concern, so I\u2019d try to not burn bridges or hold grudges over it.", "I think she was hoping that.", "I think she expected me to sit quietly and let her say it and then run out and change my daughter's name.", "How is that even pronounced?", "My youngest sister had a classmate named Indiana.
