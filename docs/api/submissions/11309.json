My fianc\u00e9 \u201cThomas\u201d (22M) and I (22F) are currently planning our wedding. We just chose our perfect venue, which happens to have a guest limit of 120 people. This is causing issues with his parents and I, and I\u2019m wondering if I am TA. Relevant info: His parents have graciously contributed about $1K to the wedding. My parents have contributed $8K, and the rest is being paid by my fianc\u00e9 and I. \n\nWe recently made our guest lists with the understanding that we would each invite roughly 60 people, and were happy to see that this ended up being the case - me with 58, and Thomas with 62. Most of the people on the list we had already spoken to, and they had already verbally confirmed that they would be there. \n\nWhile visiting his parents recently, they asked to see Thomas\u2019s guest list. He showed them, and instantly they were telling him of all these new people that he needed to invite as well - 18 people total, mostly their friends. To my surprise, Thomas said he would do so. I chimed in with \u201cWe\u2019ll try, but it may be difficult for us to find space, unless a good chunk of my family isn\u2019t able to make it.\u201d His mom responded \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, we don\u2019t mean to force people on you, but there\u2019s nothing we can do! These people must be invited.\u201d\n\nLater, I pulled Thomas aside and asked him if these were all people he had been hoping to invite, but hadn\u2019t because of space. He said no, he barely knew these people and honestly hadn\u2019t thought of them - but he felt like he couldn\u2019t tell his parents no. I told him that this was stressful for me, as we were already at our cap - but that I would try to uninvite some of my side so that we could find a way to make it work. \n\nA few hours after we had left, Thomas got a call from his parents, who told him that they would be sending us more \u201csuggestions\u201d of people to invite: in his dad\u2019s words, \u201cjust so you don\u2019t forget anyone.\u201d After Thomas hung up, I told him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable receiving more suggestions from them, as we were inviting more people than we had planned already, and I was afraid that their \u201csuggestions\u201d would actually be demands. I asked him to text his parents and tell them that we didn\u2019t want any more guest list suggestions, and that instead we would reach out if we were worried about forgetting anyone. Thomas was pretty uncomfortable with this, as he isn\u2019t used to standing up to his parents - but he eventually did so. His parents didn\u2019t respond, which he said means that they are probably upset. \n\nI feel bad, because I made my fianc\u00e9 do something he wasn\u2019t comfortable with. His parents are also usually very nice people, so I am worried I could be TA for telling them no and potentially hurting our future relationship. I just don\u2019t want to uninvite even more of my family/friends, and risk overextending our venue\u2019s capacity. Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve seen multiple people suggest that his family throw a reception/party for all their friends instead - they are actually already planning on doing that, which is why I\u2019m confused that the friends need to be invited to the wedding as well. Thanks for all the advice!\n\nSECOND EDIT: I\u2019m realizing that I may have worded things poorly - the people on my side I chose to \u201cuninvite\u201d hadn\u2019t actually received their invitations yet - they were simply on the guest list.
