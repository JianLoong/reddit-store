My fianc\u00e9 \u201cThomas\u201d (22M) and I (22F) are currently planning our wedding. We just chose our perfect venue, which happens to have a guest limit of 120 people. This is causing issues with his parents and I, and I\u2019m wondering if I am TA. Relevant info: His parents have graciously contributed about $1K to the wedding. My parents have contributed $8K, and the rest is being paid by my fianc\u00e9 and I. \n\nWe recently made our guest lists with the understanding that we would each invite roughly 60 people, and were happy to see that this ended up being the case - me with 58, and Thomas with 62. Most of the people on the list we had already spoken to, and they had already verbally confirmed that they would be there. \n\nWhile visiting his parents recently, they asked to see Thomas\u2019s guest list. He showed them, and instantly they were telling him of all these new people that he needed to invite as well - 18 people total, mostly their friends. To my surprise, Thomas said he would do so. I chimed in with \u201cWe\u2019ll try, but it may be difficult for us to find space, unless a good chunk of my family isn\u2019t able to make it.\u201d His mom responded \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, we don\u2019t mean to force people on you, but there\u2019s nothing we can do! These people must be invited.\u201d\n\nLater, I pulled Thomas aside and asked him if these were all people he had been hoping to invite, but hadn\u2019t because of space. He said no, he barely knew these people and honestly hadn\u2019t thought of them - but he felt like he couldn\u2019t tell his parents no. I told him that this was stressful for me, as we were already at our cap - but that I would try to uninvite some of my side so that we could find a way to make it work. \n\nA few hours after we had left, Thomas got a call from his parents, who told him that they would be sending us more \u201csuggestions\u201d of people to invite: in his dad\u2019s words, \u201cjust so you don\u2019t forget anyone.\u201d After Thomas hung up, I told him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable receiving more suggestions from them, as we were inviting more people than we had planned already, and I was afraid that their \u201csuggestions\u201d would actually be demands. I asked him to text his parents and tell them that we didn\u2019t want any more guest list suggestions, and that instead we would reach out if we were worried about forgetting anyone. Thomas was pretty uncomfortable with this, as he isn\u2019t used to standing up to his parents - but he eventually did so. His parents didn\u2019t respond, which he said means that they are probably upset. \n\nI feel bad, because I made my fianc\u00e9 do something he wasn\u2019t comfortable with. His parents are also usually very nice people, so I am worried I could be TA for telling them no and potentially hurting our future relationship.

We communicate about this a lot, and I know that even if it\u2019s difficult for him, he will have my back at the end of the day.", "That\u2019s the thing! We are already having a big shower at their house with all their family/friends before the wedding, and Thomas and I are flying to the other side of the country to attend. But they still want these people to attend the actual wedding in addition to that.", "They are actually doing that already, they live across the country and my fianc\u00e9 and I are paying $$$ to fly out for it.", "This is the way... alternatively, calculate the cost of the extra people and discuss how willing his parents are to cover the additional cost.\n\nYour guests should be people you and your fianc\u00e9 want there, not people your parents want there.", "Exactly! If he wants to cave to his parents demands, he can \"make room\" from his list. Her parents are already contributing significantly more to the cost of the wedding than his, it would actually be offensive to uninvite her family members (who have already been casually invited) to invite his parents' friends.", "Don't invite any of the new \"guests\" and if his parents make a fuss, give them the 1k back and uninvite them and give their spots to 2 more of your people.\n\nNTA but someone in this partnership needs to set some serious boundaries preferably both of you but at least one of you.", "Just so you know, none of this behavior is kind. I get that they are in general, but it's not kind to force your guests onto your DIL, and it's not kind to be passive aggressive by not responding. It's also not kind to make your future wife uninvite people she cares about so you can avoid difficult conversations with your parents. \n\n\nI get that you don't want to rock the boat, but it's your wedding and you have to respect yourself. It's really sad to read that you would uninvite people you care about so that strangers can see you get married. \n\nLet's be clear: your in laws are happy to worry about what other people care about them, but they don't care what you think of them, or what your potential guests think of you. That's selfish, not kind.", "Whoa wait a minute. If you're inviting people to a shower, they need to be invited to the wedding. That is basic etiquette. Now I realize when I say \"you're inviting\" it's not you personally, it's the inlaws, but if you're going to do the shower thing they do kind of need to be invites to the wedding.", "I don't think it's about cost but rather space. They chose a location where it only holds 120 ppl. I can't believe OP is willing to give up her guests just to accommodate his parents. If anyone should be giving up guests it should be the fiance", "This is a \u201cplease don\u2019t bring gifts\u201d shower - I guess more like a reception?", "I don't know. It's good you're saying no gifts, that is a plus in your column. But I don't know this is kind of a gray area. And again I get his parents are forcing this but I don't know, tough situation.", "Maybe so - the wedding is on the opposite side of the country from where he and I both grew up, and on a weekday, so the shower-invitees are mostly people who wouldn\u2019t be able to make it, or who simply wouldn\u2019t decide it was worth it to go (which I totally understand). We figured that was better than doing nothing for them at all."]}
