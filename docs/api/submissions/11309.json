My fianc\u00e9 \u201cThomas\u201d (22M) and I (22F) are currently planning our wedding. We just chose our perfect venue, which happens to have a guest limit of 120 people. This is causing issues with his parents and I, and I\u2019m wondering if I am TA. Relevant info: His parents have graciously contributed about $1K to the wedding. My parents have contributed $8K, and the rest is being paid by my fianc\u00e9 and I. \n\nWe recently made our guest lists with the understanding that we would each invite roughly 60 people, and were happy to see that this ended up being the case - me with 58, and Thomas with 62. Most of the people on the list we had already spoken to, and they had already verbally confirmed that they would be there. \n\nWhile visiting his parents recently, they asked to see Thomas\u2019s guest list. He showed them, and instantly they were telling him of all these new people that he needed to invite as well - 18 people total, mostly their friends. To my surprise, Thomas said he would do so. I chimed in with \u201cWe\u2019ll try, but it may be difficult for us to find space, unless a good chunk of my family isn\u2019t able to make it.\u201d His mom responded \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, we don\u2019t mean to force people on you, but there\u2019s nothing we can do! These people must be invited.\u201d\n\nLater, I pulled Thomas aside and asked him if these were all people he had been hoping to invite, but hadn\u2019t because of space. He said no, he barely knew these people and honestly hadn\u2019t thought of them - but he felt like he couldn\u2019t tell his parents no. I told him that this was stressful for me, as we were already at our cap - but that I would try to uninvite some of my side so that we could find a way to make it work. \n\nA few hours after we had left, Thomas got a call from his parents, who told him that they would be sending us more \u201csuggestions\u201d of people to invite: in his dad\u2019s words, \u201cjust so you don\u2019t forget anyone.\u201d After Thomas hung up, I told him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable receiving more suggestions from them, as we were inviting more people than we had planned already, and I was afraid that their \u201csuggestions\u201d would actually be demands. I asked him to text his parents and tell them that we didn\u2019t want any more guest list suggestions, and that instead we would reach out if we were worried about forgetting anyone. Thomas was pretty uncomfortable with this, as he isn\u2019t used to standing up to his parents - but he eventually did so. His parents didn\u2019t respond, which he said means that they are probably upset. \n\nI feel bad, because I made my fianc\u00e9 do something he wasn\u2019t comfortable with. His parents are also usually very nice people, so I am worried I could be TA for telling them no and potentially hurting our future relationship. I just don\u2019t want to uninvite even more of my family/friends, and risk overextending our venue\u2019s capacity.

If they were paying for the whole wedding it would be more complicated, but they\u2019re not even close to covering the costs of all these guests. You should absolutely not uninvite people you want there to accommodate his parents\u2019 random friends. This is a good opportunity for your fianc\u00e9 to practice setting boundaries with his parents\u2014 he\u2019s going to need to learn to do it many times over in your lives together.", "Info: Are you marrying into the mafia?  If lives are on the line, fine, don't offend anyone and change the venue, otherwise they have no place dictating who you have at your wedding, especially not people both of you don't even know.", "Noooppe. As a fellow bride, please don\u2019t uninvite people who truly want there to try to accommodate them. These are your fianc\u00e9s parents and he needs to put his foot down and let them know that because of venue capacity you guys will be unable to accommodate everyone and are keeping the guest list to those who are most important to you as a couple. They don\u2019t get to dictate any of that at all especially when they are not really paying for much of the wedding.\n\nAlso Thomas is an adult and needs to learn to be mature enough to stand up to his parents rather than letting them dictate things for him. If you guys don\u2019t set these boundaries now it will continue through your marriage. Who cares if it makes him uncomfortable? It\u2019s part of being an adult and planning YOUR future as a couple not your future as a couple with mom and dads input.", "NTA. But your fiance isn't ready to get married.

Cuz its his parents who want to invite people so he's the one who should be replacing guests not you. The deal was you each for 60 invites. That means his parents invites come from his invite count. Not yours. (It would be same if your parents wanted to invite people. That would come from your count. Not his.)\n\nSo definitely NTA but I have questions. And concerns. But first questions.", "NTA!

This is your wedding, not a party for their friends. If they want to host a party, give them their money back and see how far it goes in entertaining all their hangers-on.", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules.  It's pretty nervy of them to more or less demand people who aren't even close to your fianc\u00e9, especially when space is limited.\n\nIf they have their way, the guest list will be predominantly the in-law's friends.  They aren't considering what uninviting family from your side to accommodate them will do to your family relationships.

It\u2019s good that you had your fianc\u00e9 deal with it, we are all responsible for handling our own families. It seems like you\u2019ve gone about this the best way you can.
