Anyways at the time I (f19, now 20) would babysit my 3rd grade teachers kid (m6) sometimes when she went out. The agreed rate was $10/hr. One weekend she needed me for some time on both days and was gonna pay me in full on sunday. Saturday goes fine, then comes Sunday she tells me she\u2019s going out on a date and will be back at 10pm, I told her to have fun and she left. I put the kid to bed around 9 and sat in the living room waiting for her to come home. She sent me a text around 10 saying she would be a little later. She ended up coming home around 1am, gave me money and I went home. I didn\u2019t check how much she gave me because I was tired and I never had any problems with her paying me. But when I did check I saw she gave me $100 instead of $130 (I babysat total of 13 hrs that weekend) I texted her about it and she said she didn\u2019t give me the money for the 3 hours bc he was asleep, but that she\u2019d give me $15, i agreed then she said nvm i\u2019ll give you the full $30 then i never heard or saw her again or the money lol but some of my friends were saying i was being an AH bc what if she didn\u2019t have the money and it was only $30", "created_utc": 1667336230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjl4ey/aita_for_asking_for_more_money_for_babysitting/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if the kid is asleep, you are entitled to your agreed upon rate for babysitting. You are physically present and on call in case the kid needs anything. To be paid half rate for those last 3 hours would be $5/hour, which is less than minimum wage. She's the AH for not paying you the $30 she owes you.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nYou need to be paid for all of your time spent keeping her child safe.\n\nYou are already charging her an insanely cheap hourly rate, she comes home several hours later than promised, and she thinks that she should not have to pay you for the entire time you were there?!\n\nStop working for her. She takes advantage of you, is cheap, inconsiderate, and dishonest.", "NTA. Would she have let you go home when he was sleeping? No? Then you should be paid.", "NTA. Babysitting is paid by the hour.

Teacher was for taking advantage. Think of it this way: In your state or county, would she have gotten into trouble with the authorities if they had to make a call to her residence and only found a 6yo asleep?
