Not shaving is a perfectly okay choice for women. It should be your personal choice. The part that is concerning is when you say you don\u2019t shower for days because you are lazy and stressed about household finances. That is not at all normal. Shame on your mother for letting you feel the stress of household finances. Shame on her for making you feel gross when you are clearly struggling. Try to shower at least every other day, even if you don\u2019t always wash your hair. The impact on the water bill will have the impact of pennies, I promise.", "NTA at all.\n\n1) It's your body, not hers.\n\n2) Bodies are not \"gross,\" yours included.  They're just bodies and they come in all different types.\n\nThere will always be someone who wishes you would shave, and someone who wishes you would not shave.  They're not YOU, so do what YOU want.", "As long as you don't smell bad (ie shower regularly, use deodorant and brush your teeth) do whatever you want regarding your body hair.\n\nNTA", "NTA but your mom is outdated and shouldn't be calling you nasty or gross. Most Men don't shave legs or armpits, but no one calls them nasty or gross.", "NTA: As someone from a different generation I want to stress that the THOUGHT is an internalised message over which she has no control. She's entitled to her view, and in a lot of ways it is not even her perspective but the perspective of the time she was raised in.\n\nThe difference seems to be that you're not shaming her or pushing your view on her. Autonomy is about choice. She's allowed to shave, you're allowed not to. Either of you pushing your choice onto the other is disrupting autonomy and, I believe the official term is, not cool.", "NTA. Women shaving wasn't even a thing until after the invention of the safety razor, and those companies were looking for more ways to push their product on people.", "You're NTA - personal hygiene looks different to different people depending on your body's functions. I know people who shower more than once a day because they have oily skin or they sweat more. And I know people who skip out for the opposite reasons. Plus having body hair is not unhygienic, it's more natural and hygienic than shaving. Shaving is known to cause ingrown hair and infections. As long as you have a fairly regular (not necessarily daily) routine for personal hygiene, I don't see a problem here.\n\nYour mom is the ah for calling you names, it is straight up mistreatment from someone who should be kind and respectful of your bodily autonomy irrespective of their own opinions.", "NTA.   \nSpeaking as a man, body hair is natural, it belongs to the human body and anyone telling you any different is simply conditioned by society, a purely human-made construct. Nature intends us to have body hair, it is simply human desire to expect otherwise. Do not feel you need to shave anything under any circumstance. Body hair is not unhygienic. It is natural, and has a place and a function.   \nShowering on the other hand is, I feel, important. Now, when I say showering I don't mean daily 30+ min full-on cleaning sessions. You can do 'bird baths', do a quick and simple clean with water. I see the financial issues playing into your situation, and that is sad and unfortunate. But a quick rinse every day does not hurt the bill that much. Skip a shower if you want, it does not need to be daily. But do not skimp on personal hygiene either. In the end, any hygienic condition due to a lack of showering/cleaning will cost more than just doing a simple quick clean a day. Prioritize your health above all else, first and foremost.", "NTA. Your mom is.\n\nYou should shower at least every other day, and preferably daily, though.\n\nWorry less about the cost. You sound responsible and conserving is fine.

Sometimes I shave because I'm sick of my arm pit hair but I haven't shaved my legs in like 20 yrs.\n\n2. I shower every second day. My doctor recommended that.

You are free to keep your hair if you like.  If you wish to shower and shave I doubt that will run up bills.", "NTA she has the right to think it's important to shave, but you also have the right to not want to shave. And she said some crap\\*y stuff to you that was very unkind and not motherly at all. She needs to respect your choice.", "Nta. I always ask, if it can't be there, why does it grow there? Obviously, it has some purpose. Stand your ground!", "NTA.  Your body and your choice.  It is no one else\u2019s job to dictate to you on. Whichever makes you comfortable in yourself.  Times have changed and your mother has definitely not caught up.", "NTA - self explanatory.  Your body, your choice", "Just wanted to say, thank you for the replies!", "Absolutely NTA. Women shave because the Gillette company realized 100 years ago that there was a lot of money they weren't making by only selling razors to half the population. So they started running ads that told women they were gross if they weren't shaving. That's it. And you absolutely don't need to shower every day. I'm 45 and I've showered every other day my whole life, sometimes every 3 days in the winter. Unless you have a job that gets you really filthy, or have some kind of medical issue that would require bathing more, you're actually doing more harm than good by showering every single day. You're stripping your hair and skin of all their natural oils and making it drier than necessary. Tell your mom that George Carlin (a great comedian who's dead now) said, \"You don't need a shower every day; it's overkill. Just make sure you clean the 4 key areas: armpits, asshole, crotch, and teeth.\" And tell her to stop telling you you're gross. That behavior is gross. My mom did similar things to me and I spent my entire childhood thinking EVERYTHING was wrong with me - that I was disgusting, had no self control, and was overall a bad kid. I left her house 5 days after I turned 18. Threw some clothes in a bag and left. I chose to be homeless rather than put up with her abuse for one more second. Let your mom know she's driving you to do the same.\n.\nEditing to add: if you do ever decide you want to experiment with losing some body hair, there are way more options than just shaving, especially now. You can wax (test other areas first or go to a pro for the bikini area - TRUST ME - don't learn that one thru trial and error), there are depilatory creams which you leave on your skin for 10-15 minutes and the chemicals in the cream essentially \"burn\" the hair off (it's not as bad as it sounds but again, NOT for the bikini area - at most just above it), they now sell IPLs which are intensive pulses of light that, over a few months of regular use, kill the follicle and prevent hair from ever returning and you can do these treatments at home yourself, you can even bleach some of your body hair if you don't want to get rid of it but would like it to be a little less noticeable. Don't do that with actual bleach, there's a product made for body hair, I know the Sally Hansen brand makes one and surely others as well.  Again, not even encouraging you to take any of these routes, you do whatever you want and it absolutely will NOT be gross, just letting you know shaving isn't your only option should you decide it's something you want to try in the future.", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry that your mom is talking to you this way and making you feel bad about yourself. Not saying this concerns your but many neurodivergent people have issues with self care and as someone who suffers from chronic illness, showers can actually be physically and mentally draining. Give yourself some grace.", "NTA, personally I think evolution went wrong in us mammals who\u2019ve lost all their hair. I could be rockin a calico or tiger stripe ffs, but instead I gotta buy clothes throughout life.", ">she says shaving is a natural part of female hygiene\n\nThere is nothing natural about shaving. It isn't a part of hygiene. Your mom is brainwashed by advertising bullshit. I'm older than her so feel free to ignore her. She did NOT grow up in a different time. Again, I am older and half the girls at my high school didn't shave their legs. NTA.", "I bet you're the only (or oldest) child.  Maybe she's upset that you're growing up.  Or maybe money is making her crazy.\n\nRegardless, stay clean (5 minutes showers work) but shaving should be your choice.  You can always start if you find out that it's important for dating.\n\nNTA", "NTA for not wanting to shave. That is down to the individual.\n\nHaving said that, can I gently press you to really sit down and think why you don't want to shave? If it's just personal choice, then that's ok. But if you're feeling unable to ask for things like razors due to cost, that's not something a 15 year old should be dealing with.\n\nOn a slightly separate tangent - shaving or not, is NOT the same thing as showering or not. You don't necessarily have to shower every day, but going for days at a time without showering isn't great. It can also be a sign of depression.\n\nHugs for you. Hopefully people on here will be able to suggest better resources, but for now I'd ask do you have anyone you can ask advice from? Maybe a different family member, a doctor, or a school counsellor?", "NTA for not shaving. Absolutely normal. It is a ridiculous and rather sexist standard to expect women to shave for ladylike cleanliness when it\u2018s not a cleanliness requirement for men. Stupid reasoning she\u2018s using. \nBut not showering for days does actually really affect your cleanliness. Have a quick cold shower to wash all the sweaty bits and your face if you are worried about the power usage, but honestly, a short shower every day will not be what breaks the bank. It\u2018s the long showers every day and baths which use way more hot water. I have one longer shower a week, when I need to wash my hair, and I turn off the water in between (while I\u2018m putting through shampoo or conditioner). Otherwise, generally like 3-4 minutes? I think if you get into a cycle of not washing and then feeling gross and depressed, the cycle will only worsen. Take pride in how you feel. Make sure you are clean, because otherwise you might get to a point where you are smelling yourself out and about, which will only lead to more insecurities. \nYour mum is absolutely wrong about the hairy armpits and legs. That\u2018s her problem. It may be a generational thing, but don\u2018t concern yourself with that. Being clean can help to keep you healthier too though, so do concern yourself with that. Good luck.", "Personally speaking I don't think either of you are TA. You both have a right to your opinions. \n\nI know lots of women who swear on being hairless and washing everyday. I know plenty of women that shave and wash every other day. And people's routines change.\n\nFor instance I went from washing everyday to every other because it was drying my skin and making my eczema worse. And sometimes when I'm super lazy and I'm not going to see another human. I won't shower an extra day because I would rather be sat on my bed binge watching a TV show. \n\nI went from never shaving (but cleaning) my bush, to having it waxed every month without fail. You do what feels correct to you as long as your hygiene is good what is the problem?\n\nEdited due to a very good point: your mum is a bit of an AH for her comments to her teenage daughter. She definitely shouldn't be calling you gross and saying you look like a man.", "ESH but your mom waaaayyyy more!\n\nYou don\u2019t have to shave.

Not shaving isn't dirty at all. You won't get diseases if you don't do it.\nHowever you will someday discover the relationship market place. You have time for that obviously, take all the time that you need. And for now you may think that men are disguting and you would never do anything with them. But you may see some day that you would like to compete against other girls for that top man that all the highschool talks about. That is when especially other women will try to shame you if you don't shave.\nKids and teens can be pretty nasty against each other.

And you see him pick a girl that you're jealous of. What are you going to do?\nEven if feminist will try all they can to push the no shaving movement, one woman shaving is enough to ruin it all. And if it doesn't blond haired girl will have an advantage over you cause their hair are less visible.\n\nYou may think that it is unfortunate, unfair,... but there's nothing you can do about it. At least you can shave. A lot of women want a 6 foot+ man, if a man is 5'5 he's screwed. And he can not shave to become taller.

Gillette introduced the first razor marketed specifically to women, called the Milady Decollette, in 1915.

In the 21st century where most people can wash themselves as frequently as they feel the need to, body hair is inconsequential and does not impact hygeine. \n\nPlus, there's more health risks associated with shaving than being hairy.
