It's understandable that you have concerns about financially supporting your husband's passion project, especially given your responsibilities and goals. However, your approach and perspective could be improved.  \nFirstly, it's essential to communicate openly and honestly with your husband about your feelings and concerns rather than outright refusing to support him. A healthy marriage involves understanding each other's dreams and aspirations, even if they seem risky or challenging.  \nSecondly, both partners in a marriage should be supportive of each other's endeavors, and that includes emotional and financial support when feasible. Instead of seeing it as \"funding his business,\" consider it as investing in your husband's passion and dreams, which can strengthen your relationship.  \nLastly, find a middle ground through compromise and financial planning. Discuss how you both can contribute to his business without compromising your other financial responsibilities and future plans. This might involve setting aside a certain portion of your future increased income for his project or exploring other funding options.  \nRemember, a successful marriage involves supporting and working together towards each other's goals, even if they seem different at times.

There\u2019s a practical element, too - I don\u2019t know what kind of timeline your husband has in mind for growing his business, but it realistically would take years, if not decades, to save up the money to buy his tools.", "NTA.", "NTA. With your upcoming change in financial situation you need to have a discussion around how finances will be managed.\n\nIf your husband has confidence in his business, he would take a loan. Getting what he thinks is easy money from you isn\u2019t a key incentive to drive a successful business. It\u2019s concerning he is just assuming he\u2019s going to have your additional income", "So you work full time, watch the kids, go to school, and pay your share of the bills and he thinks you owe him? NTA. Eff that entirely", "NTA, I had to check for a minute and see if I was in r/entitledpeople lol because he is feeling entitled AF to your money. Which isn't just about dollars but the hours you worked towards that degree, the emotional and physical toll it took on your body especially while still working and doing the majority of the child rearing etc. The only one who should get to plan on something super special, just for themselves would be you. The secret to savings is to spend less than you make, as long as you don't start indulging like crazy with the extra you could set up a nice college fund for your daughter or save towards a big purchase. The possibilities this could have on your financial futures is huge.\n\nIf he wants to get more things to be able to do more jobs for his business then he needs to spend the money he makes doing so. If he has difficulty with impulse spending you could set up a savings account where you both need to be there to withdraw money and put the funds in there, then he has no access to it until it's absolutely needed.", "I tell him that as well, however, he\u2019s not great with money and he usually spends the checks he makes on stuff unrelated to the business.", "I told him once I get a higher paying job I\u2019ll just have my direct deposit set to deposit the same amount I make now in our shared account and the rest in my own separate account. I really don\u2019t even like the thought of that, but he\u2019s trying to spend all the extra money I\u2019m going to make before I even get it. Wth!", "No, I was in the foster system growing up. My college is completely paid for.", "We\u2019re pretty much set in the house we have now, but you\u2019re right there are going to be other expenses.", "Our money from work goes into one account and is spent between the both of us.

Don\u2019t give him any money", "NTA.\n\nBut what kind of business?", "Wait, so HIS extra income is exclusively his but YOUR extra income is also his? Ew no ma'am.", "Ummm then he uses that money to buy the things he needs.", "Welding business", "Thank you!!! He says because it\u2019ll come from my 40 hours of work and his something he\u2019s doing outside of work. As if the last 4 years of going to college & taking care of kids isn\u2019t work outside of work.", "So he wants to buy a bigger and better welding rig to get more work? I live in Texas and know more than a few. He's not a AH for needing more.\n\nWhat is your degree? \n\nBecause depending on where you live you might not see the forrest for all the trees. It sounds like you just care about making more money than him instead of getting each other to the best possible position. \n\nSelf employed welders make a ton of money. Money that could be spent on your family. Oh and by virtue of being married, you own half the business anyway. \n\nHe needs business advice. How much is what he wants to buy?", "noooooooooooooooooo", "No, it\u2019s not that at all. I would love to support him, if I saw him taking it more seriously. He can be very irresponsible with money and he\u2019s always been that way. He\u2019s made thousands of dollars in a few months without even trying that hard and only hundreds have been put back into his business. I don\u2019t like that he thinks he\u2019s going to use all of our extra income, no matter what it comes from, on himself & himself alone.", "Fair enough. I am always of the feeling that a good number of AITA posts should be in the Relationship Advice Subreddit first before calling people AHs.\n\nDoes he have another job?\n\nHe needs both motivation and guidance.

Have your paycheck deposited into your own account, if you currently use a communal account.\n\nIf his business plan doesn't include plans for more equipment, such as small business loans, it isn't a business. It's a vanity project.", "Check into leasing the welding equipment. It\u2019s also a write off for his business.

You're not \"winning at life\" by earning more than someone else. The secret to nearly every successful business owner is a supportive (and sometimes brilliant) partner. You both need to do what you think is best and WANT to do.\n\nI believe what is happening here is your husband is hoping you'll support his endeavor so you too can be an owner as opposed to a well paid employee... but he lacks the articulation to say it.\n\nThe only thing I can't tell you is if he truly would be successful with a modicum of support, or if he would rest on laurels as soon as possible.

Take his hand and drag him with you to a financial advicer. Like couple\u2019s therapy about economy. Then you don\u2019t have to be the one telling him all the necessary stuff, the one assessing his business plan and advising how to spend/sort/divide your separate and joined income,  etc. It can  be really beneficial to have a neutral expert in your conversations so you don\u2019t have to do all the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d.", "NAH I think his expectation of support in his business and wanting avoid debt makes sense. As I'm sure he's supported you going to school, maybe not with money but with the added responsibilities while you were occupied with classes. \n\nYou are absolutely in the right to not want to throw money at something you think he hasn't put full efforts into. Especially when you've worked and gone to school which takes a lot of effort. \n\nGrowing his business, if he's serious about it, is much better done with the least amount of debt possible. \n\nI don't think either of you are aholes here, but I do think you're at odds. Perhaps a goal oriented internal loan from the \"family\" to the \"business\" would solve it. As he and his business meet benchmarks money can be invested.
