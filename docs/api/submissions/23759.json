My husband turned down a more lucrative job offer at one point because he would have switched from something he enjoyed and was good at to a job that he'd be miserable at and barely qualified for.\n\nCan you be the bank?

I\u2019ve been doing it all this time & I\u2019m almost done so I would say I\u2019m okay. My kids are very well taken care of and barely ever see me doing any kind of school work because I mostly do it when they\u2019re asleep \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "I\u2019m sure we will figure it out. I will support it if I make enough and he actually starts putting in more effort. He\u2019s actually a very good welder, he made a few thousand dollars in the first month of him doing it but now he just expects people to come to him. It\u2019s slowed down a lot already and he\u2019s not really doing anything else to get more clients.", "Not if she has or gets her own bank account", "> I told him to set up a separate account for the business because he\u2019s getting cash right now and he\u2019s not keeping track of it.\n\nNot an accountant, but someone who used to have a small business.\n\nIt's probably not a big deal right now, because of the small amounts of money, but your husband REALLY needs to set up an LLC and a separate bank account.\n\nYeah, generally, the taxes are a pass-through (taxed as personal income), but you need to keep the monies separate.  Or you've \"pierced the veil\", meaning the IRS won't consider your assets separate from business assets.  Source:  My aunt and uncle had to declare bankruptcy, and my aunt lost her interest in another business, because they comingled too much money trying to keep a business afloat.", "So he has no drive or ambition, and investing in a business run by him would be a terrible idea. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t stay romantically involved with someone like that either, as he\u2019s going to hold you back forever, but you guys are pretty far in now so that part is for you to decide", "You seem to be smart about this. You will find a way to have your need for stability balanced with what he wants.", "In another comment you said all the money you both make goes in one account. Feels like you're changing your story based on what you think will get you the most sympathy. \n\nActing like this (super defensive and changing your story) just reinforces my YTA vote.", "What is your actual job and how old is your son? This is the second school-based explanation but you haven\u2019t explained how you\u2019re working and being a stay at home mom at the exact same time.", "That's a great way to look at it.", "I\u2019d say if hubby is serious, he needs to download and fill it out himself-\u2014he needs to do the legwork to get his business on its feet, not OP", "No, the other comment said once I start making more I would contribute the same amount that I do now to our combined account and have the rest go to a separate savings account. I don\u2019t need sympathy, I just wanted opinions.", "I have been working from home for almost 5 years now. I really don\u2019t need to explain to you how I make it work. I just told you my job is relatively easy and I\u2019m able to work and still play with my kids", "Dude, you are misunderstanding me and getting defensive when I\u2019m not attacking you, all I\u2019m asking is, why are you taking on so much (the implication is, where is your husband in all this?) and you are TA to yourself. Like, you\u2019re really on here asking strangers if you\u2019re an asshole for not wanting to bankroll your husband? Is that really the extent of your problems? Judging by your post history, it isn\u2019t.", "Sorry, I\u2019ve had multiple people being my kids into this question & I really don\u2019t like that. I was being defensive because you\u2019re saying I ignore my kids & trust me, I don\u2019t. It is very hard to keep up with it all but I\u2019m almost done and I know it\u2019ll be worth it in the end. And I really didn\u2019t expect this question to get so many responses, I thought I would get 20 max and I could show my husband that I\u2019m not the only one who thinks it\u2019s a bad idea.", "There\u2019s a lot more to this question then just a few strangers on Reddit giving you the validation you want. \n\nJust go talk to him and have a long thought out, heart to heart about things and see where it goes. \n\nAgain, strangers agreeing with you on the internet is only going to give you a \u201cI\u2019m right you\u2019re wrong\u201d complex and then it\u2019ll truly be bad lol", "NTA.\n\nThe biggest piece is that he didn't ask you about it. It would have, in my opinion, been an okay thing to ask, especially if he had a solid plan on mind for how much he needs and how he would invest it. But to just assume that he gets to spend the money you make however he wants is disrespectful and inconsiderate of your life goals together.", "NTA as it doesn't sound like he's been supporting you", "IDK - i think no one sucks here.   \n\nDid he help pay your tuition?  You cant help him get his business settled?   sounds one sided to me ....   especially if this business is what he wants to do with his work life.", "NTA\n\nWait ... what? You work full time, go to school full time and are the primary caregiver to the children? What does he bring to the table? He is not funding your school so he should not be sitting around waiting for your riches to fund his hobby. Stand your ground.", "NTA- this is the wrong way to make a business pitch. If the initial funding is coming out of your pocket, how does money make it's way back INTO your pocket (and on what timeline), ideally with some interest or something resembling an incentive (e.g. partial ownership of the company)?\n\nIf you trust your husband to put in the work to grow the business & meet whatever goals/benchmarks he sets, & it makes your household more profitable overall, it's probably a good investment. But if you're providing seed money, you BETTER get something in return for it.", "You can see it like that, but you can see it as an investment. Tell him to write a business plan, and different scenarios: how much would he make if you bought the tools, how much bigger would the projects be, etc? So if you invest in the business, you\u2019d get a piece of the profits. Ask him to list the tools and prioritize which should be bought first, how much they cost, where ( you can buy used tools) etc. \n\nThings to consider: who pays for your tuition mow, and if it\u2019s a loan, who will pay for it? Because if it\u2019s you, you\u2019ll be paying it from that salary bump, not make do without .\n\n\nYou might want a cleaning service etc from the \u201cmore money\u201d you\u2019ll earn: make a list of what you want to do ( college acts for the kids, new car, etc) and see how it will all work. \n\nSo this way, you know how he\u2019s going to run his business, you\u2019ll have some input, and you both will be able to steer your lives, by knowing the wants and needs of the other. Good luck with school!", "OP=NTA\n\nbut you need to make sure you have a separate account for when you are making more so that you only match his fund(or do a reasonable percentage).\n\nYou are working full time AND providing daycare--seems to me that you are already providing MORE value than he is.", "She works full time, he works when he has projects he can handle.\n\nShe takes care of the kids/house, what does he do? Nothing mentioned other than she does majority of the load.\n\nShe is also going to school to better herself. He has done nothing to help her achieve her dreams. He can take out a SBL like the majority of business owners do when they first start out.\n\nSounds like he is lazy and expects his \"partner\" to bankroll so he isn't on the hook to pay back money if he fails.", "Is the way of the world for you to not read posts and just spew misogynistic drivel without basis? What part of this did you miss? OP works full time and contributes to the shared account, the OP does ALL the housework, and most of the childcare. Seems to me your foolish accusations are more likely applicable to the lazy husband.", "If HE doesn't want to put his money into the business, why should you? Definitely NTA.", "Never fund a financially irresponsible person, especially if they're family", "The LAST thing a person who is \"not great with money\" should do is start a business.

Yes the money we both make from our actual jobs goes into one account. All the money he\u2019s made from this side business has been spent on himself & not much has gone back into the business.", "NTA. Keep your finances separate.
