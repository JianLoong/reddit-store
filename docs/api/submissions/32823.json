To me relaxing is seeing my friends , sewing , making some jewelries , playing with my animals , having my privacy and control over my day. \nIn vacation I can't do any of that (I even have to share a room with my brother). So while my family likes it I always found myself wanting to go home in order to do the stuff that makes me happy\n\nFor this summer my family got invided one week in Portgual by my grand parents for their 50 year weddding anniversary. It's fine because I can totally make an effort for an occasion like this (Even if I rather be at home).

You need to have a sit-down task with your mum. Start off by asking her why she wants you to come. \u0130f she says it's for her/the family, v remind her that you're growing up. \u0130f she says it's for your sake, and it'll be enjoyable, ASK again what kinds of things she thinks you enjoy. \n\nRemind her that you're grateful for the money spent but that you're not a kid anymore.", "NTA.\n\nYou're old enough to decide what you want to do with your vacations, and it doesn't make you selfish if you don't want to spend an extra week there.\n\nBut if not having control is the part that bothers you, is there anything you can bring with you to help with that? Not friends or pets, obviously, but what about sewing or jewelry-making? Do you have some kind of small travel kit you can take with you and work on during the vacation?", "NTA, but i understand that your mum wants to spend time together as a family on vacation. This time there's not much you can do, but try and convince her to plan shorter vacations so you have downtime as well?", "Haven\u2019t seen one in the comments yet, but let me play devils advocate and say YTA. \n\nAccording to other comments they pay for your living expenses and tuition still, and would be paying thousands more so you can be with them. Some people\u2019s parents including my own charged me rent(while sharing a room with my brother) and I had to pay for school, but I still make effort to help them whenever I can because I can sacrifice my days off when they sacrificed their entire 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s. \n\nThey also probably just want memories to share with you. If they look back over the years, it might be sad to see you\u2019re missing from all the adventures. \n\nAnd if its really bad being there with them OP, you can still find time alone visiting parks, cafes, or renting your own hotel for a day or two during the trip to escape. \n\nBut end of the day, nobody could force you to go, I think those are just some reasons why you would reconsider.", "NTA. She is the selfish one for booking you an extra week knowing you didn't want it. Don;t stay for the second week. If you don;t make a stand she will keep on doing it.", "NTA  \nAs so often happens, the selfish one is your demanding mother who doesn't care at all about what you want to do.", "Thank you , I wish my parents (especially my mom) could understand that. She is really happy to travel and go to vacations but it's not my case. Despite that everytime I told her I didn't wanted to go she would things like \"Oh you always says that but when we are in vacation you end up liking being there\" Which is not true", "My mother is pretty scary you know", "No , I said in the post that I was willing to go for the week of vacation my Grand parents planned \nI just don't want to go to the second week that my mom planned without telling me and despite me saying that I don't want to go", "She said she'd be there for the 50th, just not for the extra week.", "I mean I don't want to leave on a bad note and create tensions\nIf I really have to go I guess I'll suck it up and go. I don't think those vacations are worth a conflict with my mother (She is with my dad the one paying for my studies and my living expenses after all. I am adult but I'm nowhere near independant and emancipated currently)", "They are indeed funding my living expenses and college\nBut there are lot of way to have quality time. Vacations are not a way to have this quality time with me because I don't like it and don't feel happy at all in those times (Difficut to get quality time in those conditions)\n\nAnything else is fine , I can cook , garden , going to amusement parks , visiting things that are not to far away\nHonestly anything that doesn't include leaving my home and hobbies for days", "It could be that , but she always acted like this even when I was still living with her\nIt's not a new behavior at all", "I am grateful for the money spent and for her wanting me there , that's true. Honestly this problem is not even about me disliking my family , or wanting to be left alone\n\nI just use my vacations to do things that actually relax me and gives me hapiness. Going to vacation is just really boring to me (+ I have to share a room with my brother when I really value privacy). I wish she would listen to me , I'll try talking to her again about this", "Fair enough I admit", "Uh, I don't want to imagine now. Learn to stand up to her when you really don't want to go. What can she do? It would be illegal for her to k*ll you or hurt you physically. Some yelling, unkind words and drawn faces you just let pass over you. Sooner or later she will run out of air.", "So your plan is to just let her control you forever?", "She is paying for my college and living expenses. I need her money so I can't go into conflict with her\nBeside despite this I still like her and don't want to damage the relationship", "That is highly relevant information that you might have mentioned in the original post as it changes everything. (S)he who pays the piper gets to decide the tune. In a situation like this, nothing as crude as what I have hitherto suggested will do. You need to do your finest negotiation. Think of how she can get as much of something she really wants at the same time as you gets as much of what you want as possible. It will be difficult, but it can be done. If I am wrong, console yourself that you will not be going to college forever."]}
