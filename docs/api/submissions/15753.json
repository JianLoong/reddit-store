The situations are not comparable. Everyone saying that people calling him the AH are displaying misandry clearly have no idea that there is NOTHING EQUAL about having a child. Nothing. Even if a father did 50% of the work, the mother is still doing doing her 50% of the work while physically and mentally healing from 9 months of pregnancy and either birth or major surgery. When you add breastfeeding to the mix it means it\u2019s even more unequal in caring for a child, so implying that treating mothers and fathers different is misandry is super close minded.

Also, the kids are both in daycare most of the time while they both work from home, so it's not like he's parenting all day every day when she has a work trip. Also, her work trip is just a day-evening thing, so it's actually just a day she is going to work in person and not from home.

OP would not be an AH if he was asking for a night to go see a concert with a friend. He would simply be requesting a day for himself, while otherwise being a good father. In this case, the wife is simply requesting a day to herself, but is otherwise a good and present mother (baby would already be weaned if this was not the case). So no, I don't think that if the roles were reversed, I would choose any differently.
