Elle is not her real name. \n\nTo start, my (F22) sister Elle(F27) has had schizophrenia for going on 8 years. She's been mostly unmedicated, save for when she's been in jail. It's a cycle, she'll use meth when she's out, go to jail for any number of reasons, get clean and medicated while in, than get out and go right back to her old habits. Truth be told, our mom is so in denial about Elle drug use that unless she's really doped up, I have a hard time telling if it's drugs or just Elle unmedicated, which is how she is now. (Though I'm leaning towards no meth, she's been relatively calm. I think she has been taking some medication, but you never really know with her, and mom will always say that she is.)\n\nFor the past few weeks, my sister has had this stuffed animal that's she's been calling Bee, and while I'm not actually sure if she sees it as her baby, she certainly acts like it. She'll talk for it and buy it things, and try to get you to hug it. Okay, no harm I guess, certainly better than some of the other delusions she's had. Normally if she tries to talk to you about her delusions, we kinda reinforce that they're not real. Not to be mean, just things like \"no, you're not a fire fairy\" or \"stop talking to them, there's no demons here, just us.\" Though I leave most of this to my mom, since she has more experience with this and takes care of her most often, but I guess she's letting Elle keep this one since it's not doing much harm.  I could go on and on with the dynamics but I'll try to keep it short. \n\nObviously, I'll be taking my daughter, who's 4, trick or treating, and my mom wants me to take Elle and Bee as well, and that she's going to get a stroller for Bee since Elle already got it a costume, I guess. Let them go door to door and let Bee ask for candy, like a kid. I expressed that I'm uncomfortable with this and that I'd have to think about it, to which my mom started with her usual guilt trip of \"well, I guess I could take her. Not sure how well be able to manage since my back is bad and my foot never got better after it broke but it's fine. Really it's fine\" you know.\n\n I'm not trying to be unsupportive, but this could very easily go wrong in a number of ways. First, Elle is unpredictable and could wig out, and she has a habit of cursing and saying really, *really* fowl things out of nowhere. I mean really bad, I don't feel comfortable repeating here, and there will be *real* kids around. Second, what happens when we run into adults who won't look past it? That said, her behavior has really been improving, whether that's because she's off meth for now or because she's taking medication, I genuinely can't be sure. \n\nThere's a lot more nuance here, but that's the most important context, I think. I asked my friend she thinks that I should, and that she hasn't wigged out in a while and to give her a chance, though I still disagree. I have some family members (all in another state) saying that it's not a big deal and that I need to give my mom a break, which is what I think is making me rethink. She has been a let better lately, and the outburst have been non existent for a few months now, which my mom is crediting medication for. \n\n\nTldr- My older sister, whose mentally ill, wants to take her stuffed animal trick or treating and our mother is guilt tripping me about it, but I think too many things go could go wrong and frankly I'm not comfortable with it.", "created_utc": 1698095596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17evaxk/wibta_if_i_dont_take_my_sister_whos_schizophrenic/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just say no. Protect your child. \n\nYour mother should tell her no as well. I suspect the reason she wants her to go with you is that you have a legitimate child to take trick-or-treating and she feels it will be less embarrassing. Don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t let them do it to you.", "NTA. You don't mention if you live with your mom and sister, but either way, you have no responsibility to take her with you and your daughter and indulge her delusions.

I'd tell your mother, no. She can take your sister, even with her bad back and foot, it will just be a short outing.", "I don't know where you live but where I'm at, the neighbors would be *pissed* that someone that age is trick or treating. They get pissed if the older teens ask for candy when they are in a group with little kids. I can't even imagine dealing with that.", "NTA. Your child comes first for you, just like your mom\u2019s child comes first for her. It is not right to take your child trick or treating adult who is unstable and could potentially get overstimulated and become out of control. That\u2019s not ableist. That\u2019s stating a fact. Not everyone can handle every situation, mental illness or not. Someone may potentially upset your sister by commenting on her behavior.  And frankly your mother is irresponsible if she takes your sister out and puts her and others at risk of her having meltdown. Who\u2019s to say this isn\u2019t the time she gets violent?", "NTA. Trick or treating is for real children, not adults with stuffed toys. It would be one thing if she was mentally the age of a child, but she's apparently not, so she should be able to understand that it's not something for her to do.", "Nta you gotta protext your kid and a night with an unmedicated and delusional schizophrenia person does not sound safe.", "NTA as it sounds like your sister can be very volatile and you would not feel safe being her caregiver for the evening while also caring for your 4 year old, in a situation where there would be many young children around. And put like that, it seems pretty reasonable for you not to feel safe in that situation as it sounds like your sister requires a 1:1 caregiver and a 4 year old certainly does. I think if your Mom can't come with you all it is reasonable to say no to taking Elle as you cannot split your attention like that.", "Listen, I'll give everybody candy for Halloween, no matter their age or costume status, but this is not a good situation for you. Your sister needs a chaperone for trick-or-treating, and you will be busy chaperoning your child (who is only four!).

DO NOT let her guilt you into taking responsibility for Elle if you don\u2019t want to. No is a full sentence.", "NTA and your mother is out of her mind for even suggesting this.  If she must, set up a pretend trick or treat thing in the back yard with stations she can stop at.  Real trick or treating for someone this age is not acceptable.  \n\nMaybe she can participate in handing out candy to the children on Halloween, that way if she gets out of hand, she can just go to her room, instead of being caught out with an episode.", "People are too willing to gamble with your daughter. Just because Elle has issues that she may or may not be addressing does not mean that your daughter isn\u2019t entitled to have a happy Halloween with her mom. That shouldn\u2019t get taken away from her just because Elle may pick Halloween to be the day she behaves. And to be honest, the thing with the stuffed toy doesn\u2019t do it for me. I think it\u2019s a main character attention stunt. Don\u2019t buy into any of it. NTA", "NTA. Despite being a \"scary\" holiday, kids enjoying Halloween should not be scared if someone acts poorly/violently. I'm sorry for this tragic situation.", "NTA. She has a serious mental illness and a drug addiction. Keep her away from your kid.", "So different take here. People (other people, not you) need to get a grip and not be such ableist ah about someone with an actual disability saying things they find offensive or behaving in ways they don't understand.   \nReally, it gets old and being disabled does not equate them to being dangerous.   \nHowever, mom needs to reach out and take your sister to a trunk or treat event with people she (mom) knows or not take her out at all but its on your mom either way.  \nIt is completely unacceptable of her to think that it's your job.   \nI get it, I really, really, really get it! The idea of the kid who's struggling significantly with a disability being able to hang out with their non disabled sibling, get out on a walk, have some fun, etc. seems like a nice idea but this isnt that.   \nHalloween is for your daughter, its for her to make memories as a 4 year old and have fun and you having your sister along would add a lot of stress and the possibility that she'd say or do something that others would inevitably judge and your night would easily go to shi!.   \nTell mom in no uncertain terms NO! She can figure out a way to entertain your sister on Halloween while you parent your own daughter but dont take your sister with.   \nYou're not ta.", "Nta - clear boundaries must be set with mental illnesses such as this.  Aaaaaand.... she's 27.  There is no reason on this planet that she needs to go trick or treating.  Your sister is your mum's responsibility.  Your daughter is yours.  Sorry mum..", "NTA - they should stay home and hand out candy", "NTA. I have zero problem with someone with a mental illness trick or treating or taking their baby doll or stuffie. However, she, in the past has had drug issues, and you would be with a 4 year old. That could turn rough fast. I\u2019ve had some experience with people with the same illness as your sister and one needs constant monitoring, one is super nice, but would not want to be around anyone else period, and another with his medication can see purple faces, but can tell himself they are not real. It\u2019s when the medication needs adjustment is the trouble. He can turn to self-harm. So, to me, trick or treating with loud noises, people running in costumes, flashing lights, all that\u2026could be way way too much. A trunk or treat would be great or a mall where the stores give out candy would probably be a better and quieter environment.", "NTA.  Your job is to take care of your daughter and not put her in risky situations.  Your mom can take your sister if it\u2019s that important.", "Yeah, what could possibly go wrong here? NTA", "NTA. You would not be helping your sister by reinforcing a delusion and you are correct that this could go very wrong.", "Nta why ruin your and your child's Halloween?  If you take her and she expects people to give candy to a fake child you will be an ahole. That is fraud.  I would be pissed if an adult came to my door expecting me to give a doll candy. Also I would be really angry if my child was exposed to profanity while out on Halloween.  The world does not revolve around your sister.  This whole idea is totally \nunappropriate. Stand up for yourself and your child. If your mom thinks sis should go trick or treating let mom take her. So what if mom has some discomfort. Your child or your sister, which is more important to you?  Be a good mom.", "NTA, your sister has a diagnosed mental condition, you cannot take her treat or treating with small kids around... she is a danger to herself and those around her...\n\nAs you say, what if someone doesn't go along with it, not everybody understand mental issues...", "NTA. If your mom thinks your sister needs to exercise her delusions then she can take her.", "Some people in my area reeeally commit to Halloween. I'm talking fully decorated yards and people in really great costumes with plenty of jump scares. I can't imagine bringing a schizophrenic into that while looking after a 4 year old. NTA.", "NTA first of all you will be, quite rightly, concentrating on your daughter. Let's face it an excited 4yr old getting a whole bucket full of sweets is like trying to hold onto a giant octopus. \n\n2nd; I would be concerned that your sister has had delusions where she believes there are demons in the room. If she is confronted with a lot of children in bright costumes with masks and facepaint, it could spark a fear response. Your sister, although going through a calm period, is unpredictable and if she usually needs your mum to calm her down, it could turn into an extremely traumatic situation for everyone.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom can take your sister trick and treating, no need for YOU to do it.", "I don\u2019t think this sounds harmless at all, but I\u2019m not a psychiatrist and have no experience with treatment for this brand of mental illness.  Regardless, trick-or-treating is a *terrible idea.*  You\u2019re talking about taking someone who hallucinates supernatural entities on a night-time stroll around tons of spooky decorations, odd noises, and people in costumes, with the inanimate object she is treating as a child along.  Oh and there will be actual children around.  In the potentially trigger-y costumes.    And also adults who may act fake-threatening, or may actually mock her or threaten \u201cBee\u2019s\u201d safety.  \n\nNope, nope, nopity nope with a side of nope sauce.  Do not.
