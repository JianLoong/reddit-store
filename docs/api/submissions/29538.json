Elle is not her real name. \n\nTo start, my (F22) sister Elle(F27) has had schizophrenia for going on 8 years. She's been mostly unmedicated, save for when she's been in jail. It's a cycle, she'll use meth when she's out, go to jail for any number of reasons, get clean and medicated while in, than get out and go right back to her old habits. Truth be told, our mom is so in denial about Elle drug use that unless she's really doped up, I have a hard time telling if it's drugs or just Elle unmedicated, which is how she is now. (Though I'm leaning towards no meth, she's been relatively calm. I think she has been taking some medication, but you never really know with her, and mom will always say that she is.)\n\nFor the past few weeks, my sister has had this stuffed animal that's she's been calling Bee, and while I'm not actually sure if she sees it as her baby, she certainly acts like it. She'll talk for it and buy it things, and try to get you to hug it. Okay, no harm I guess, certainly better than some of the other delusions she's had. Normally if she tries to talk to you about her delusions, we kinda reinforce that they're not real. Not to be mean, just things like \"no, you're not a fire fairy\" or \"stop talking to them, there's no demons here, just us.\" Though I leave most of this to my mom, since she has more experience with this and takes care of her most often, but I guess she's letting Elle keep this one since it's not doing much harm.  I could go on and on with the dynamics but I'll try to keep it short. \n\nObviously, I'll be taking my daughter, who's 4, trick or treating, and my mom wants me to take Elle and Bee as well, and that she's going to get a stroller for Bee since Elle already got it a costume, I guess. Let them go door to door and let Bee ask for candy, like a kid. I expressed that I'm uncomfortable with this and that I'd have to think about it, to which my mom started with her usual guilt trip of \"well, I guess I could take her. Not sure how well be able to manage since my back is bad and my foot never got better after it broke but it's fine. Really it's fine\" you know.\n\n I'm not trying to be unsupportive, but this could very easily go wrong in a number of ways. First, Elle is unpredictable and could wig out, and she has a habit of cursing and saying really, *really* fowl things out of nowhere. I mean really bad, I don't feel comfortable repeating here, and there will be *real* kids around. Second, what happens when we run into adults who won't look past it? That said, her behavior has really been improving, whether that's because she's off meth for now or because she's taking medication, I genuinely can't be sure. \n\nThere's a lot more nuance here, but that's the most important context, I think. I asked my friend she thinks that I should, and that she hasn't wigged out in a while and to give her a chance, though I still disagree. I have some family members (all in another state) saying that it's not a big deal and that I need to give my mom a break, which is what I think is making me rethink. She has been a let better lately, and the outburst have been non existent for a few months now, which my mom is crediting medication for. \n\n\nTldr- My older sister, whose mentally ill, wants to take her stuffed animal trick or treating and our mother is guilt tripping me about it, but I think too many things go could go wrong and frankly I'm not comfortable with it.", "created_utc": 1698095596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17evaxk/wibta_if_i_dont_take_my_sister_whos_schizophrenic/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just say no. Protect your child. \n\nYour mother should tell her no as well.

Your child comes first for you, just like your mom\u2019s child comes first for her. It is not right to take your child trick or treating adult who is unstable and could potentially get overstimulated and become out of control. That\u2019s not ableist. That\u2019s stating a fact. Not everyone can handle every situation, mental illness or not. Someone may potentially upset your sister by commenting on her behavior.

Trick or treating is for real children, not adults with stuffed toys. It would be one thing if she was mentally the age of a child, but she's apparently not, so she should be able to understand that it's not something for her to do.", "Nta you gotta protext your kid and a night with an unmedicated and delusional schizophrenia person does not sound safe.", "NTA as it sounds like your sister can be very volatile and you would not feel safe being her caregiver for the evening while also caring for your 4 year old, in a situation where there would be many young children around. And put like that, it seems pretty reasonable for you not to feel safe in that situation as it sounds like your sister requires a 1:1 caregiver and a 4 year old certainly does.

Just because Elle has issues that she may or may not be addressing does not mean that your daughter isn\u2019t entitled to have a happy Halloween with her mom. That shouldn\u2019t get taken away from her just because Elle may pick Halloween to be the day she behaves. And to be honest, the thing with the stuffed toy doesn\u2019t do it for me.

I\u2019ve had some experience with people with the same illness as your sister and one needs constant monitoring, one is super nice, but would not want to be around anyone else period, and another with his medication can see purple faces, but can tell himself they are not real. It\u2019s when the medication needs adjustment is the trouble. He can turn to self-harm. So, to me, trick or treating with loud noises, people running in costumes, flashing lights, all that\u2026could be way way too much.

You would not be helping your sister by reinforcing a delusion and you are correct that this could go very wrong.", "Nta why ruin your and your child's Halloween?  If you take her and she expects people to give candy to a fake child you will be an ahole. That is fraud.  I would be pissed if an adult came to my door expecting me to give a doll candy. Also I would be really angry if my child was exposed to profanity while out on Halloween.  The world does not revolve around your sister.  This whole idea is totally \nunappropriate. Stand up for yourself and your child. If your mom thinks sis should go trick or treating let mom take her. So what if mom has some discomfort. Your child or your sister, which is more important to you?

If your mom thinks your sister needs to exercise her delusions then she can take her.", "Some people in my area reeeally commit to Halloween.

Regardless, trick-or-treating is a *terrible idea.*  You\u2019re talking about taking someone who hallucinates supernatural entities on a night-time stroll around tons of spooky decorations, odd noises, and people in costumes, with the inanimate object she is treating as a child along.  Oh and there will be actual children around.  In the potentially trigger-y costumes.

Taking her trick-or-treating is simply too risky-- and if your mom refuses to see that, try emphasizing that it might hurt *Elle*. Overwhelming situations full of lots of people and different stimuli are not good for many disorders, and so trick-or-treating might just trigger something very unpleasant or even harmful for her. Even if your mom refuses to realize that not everyone will play along and give candy to the \"baby,\" and might become hostile, she might perhaps listen to the reasoning that the lights and sounds and busyness could cause an issue? \n\nYou could also suggest trunk-or-treating with people your mom knows-- that way your mom has to walk a lot less, and people can be informed ahead of time what the situation is; and you wouldn't have to be involved at all. A more controlled situation would be much safer for Elle and everyone else involved. Given her propensity for saying terrible things out of nowhere, it might be wise to do a small trunk-or-treat just for her and the \"baby,\" so no kids are exposed to potential harm. If your mom doesn't have friends who would be willing to do that, maybe a mental health charity or a sufficiently progressive group of church biddies would be willing to set up a trunk-or-treat for people with mental health needs.\n\nBut in the end, you're not obligated to do any of this for your sister. If your mom wants to make a bad decision that could harm Elle and cause problems with others, then *your mom* has to be the one who does it. She can't lay any of it at your feet. You are not a medical decision-maker for her and are not sufficiently informed about her full health situation; you don't even know what drugs (legal or illegal) she's on!", "I thought I had heard it all , bringing a stuffed animal trick or treating is pretty much one of the dumbest things I\u2019ve heard", "NTA - a 27 year old woman doesn\u2019t have any business trick or treating.

Do not take on responsibility for sis.  Do not split your attention between your daughter and sister.", "NTA.  What are you supposed to do if she flips out?  Does she get violent?  How are you supposed to keep your actual child safe if Elle gets triggered?\n\nYour mom can either take her or tell her no.  If you decide to take her, please bring an extra person to help so you don\u2019t have to choose between your child/Elle/bystanders if there is an episode.", "NTA. Your sister is an adult. If she came to my door, I\u2019d think it was weird and she was weird and I\u2019d get weirded out (I\u2019d probably get worried that she was going to attack me because adults don\u2019t go trick or treating so there must be something else going on) and your daughter would pick up on my emotion but because she\u2019s 4, she\u2019d think I was weirded out by her. Trick or treat was magical for my son when he was 4 (he\u2019s 19 now). He adored dressing up, he adored the candy. Tell your mother that you need to concentrate on going trick or treat with your daughter. Your sister shouldn\u2019t even be going out, so let your mother deal with the consequences.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let your small child around a severely mentally ill person known to abuse hard drugs. It\u2019ll be too late for regrets if something happens. Mom can live in denial and take all the risks she likes, she can\u2019t force the rest of you to do so.", "NTA I didn't have to read past schizophrenic. My ex-husband is an unmedicated schizophrenic with multiple addictions, and unstable as fuck. NO WAY would I take him anywhere, much less out trick or treating where there will be lots of noise and people in costumes. Not to mention kids that will be traumatized if they have to witness a schizophrenic flip-out, I know I still am as an adult and I've been divorced for 22 years.", "NTA. You have a young child you want to protect. Why take the risk? The potential for your child or another to be exposed to something traumatic, let alone dangerous, is too great.", "Nta", "NTA. \"A lot better lately\" does not mean \"totally 100% going to be fine in a high-stimulus environment where not everyone will understand or be kind about your sister's delusion.\" Managing one four year old on Halloween is a full time job.\n\nSeconding the suggestions of trunk or treat.", "All those family members in another state DONT get an opinion. They aren\u2019t in the trenches with you. \n\nDo you want to risk turning Halloween into a horror show for your child?  There\u2019s a memory to last a lifetime.", "NTA. Trust your gut. Neither your sister nor your mother are honest about the severity of her psychosis and you will have your child with you. If your mother wants to unleash this on the neighborhood, leave her to it. Your sister is due for a meltdown. Please don't enable it to happen in front of a bunch if kids trying to have a good time.", "NTA. Let your mom and her broken back and limp foot take it. That way it\u2019ll be a shorter trip for them. It isn\u2019t worth ruining Halloween for your own daughter.", "NTA. Meth use can cause drug induced psychosis. Couple that with schizophrenia & it\u2019s a recipe for disaster. Protect your child.", "NTA. This is a situation where you are not required to participate. Take your little girl out and not sis.", "I'm sorry but I would be more concerned with what your mom is doing to set her up when she can no longer take care of her. This is more important then Halloween. I bet she's thinking you'll take care of one if not both of them", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Halloween night will have sensory overload factors not present on a normal day. Possible strobe lighting, scary music off and on at different houses, people or animatronics  jumping out of shadows to give a friendly scare, and lots of little kids in costumes. Even if your sister is behaving beautifully on a typical day, the extraordinary circumstances of Halloween could easily be too much for her without it even being in her control. \n\nHalloween night you are focused on your child\u2019s safety. Your sister needs a separate adult focused on her safety. By saying no you are looking out for your sister. If you have other relatives complaining about your choice then it sounds like they are excellent volunteers to take your sister out on Halloween- I mean it, straight up put them on the spot.", "NTA but you\u2019ve got to stop dancing to your mother\u2019s guilt trip performance. She does it because it works on you. It\u2019s absolutely absurd to consider taking an unstable woman that may or may not be on meth around children. Why are you considering having her around *your* child? I understand that you don\u2019t control what Elle does, but you do have control over whether you put your daughter in that unsafe position.", "My job is a manager/supervisor at a mental health group facility. So I\u2019m speaking as a professional mental health provider, and as someone with experience supporting clients with schizophrenia and planning their care. \n\nYour sister going trick or treating like this is a terrible idea. The risk of something triggering her psychosis is so high, it\u2019s pretty much a guarantee. Halloween is unpredictable. Not something someone experiencing psychosis needs. Being around large groups of vulnerable children with so many uncontrollable triggers is a recipe for disaster. \n\nIf you want to help, suggest your mom find a daytime (many are church sponsored) trunk or treat or similar. Or go to a mall for trick or treating. Something with controlled admission/crowds, no strange lights, props or illusions, and no triggering sounds. Maybe mom can babysit your 4 year old while you take sis.", "NTA. I would be concerned about how people will react to your sister and her stuffed animal, and in turn how your sister will then react. And if your sister has the capacity to go off the rails how will you handle her and your 4 year old at the she has an incident? This Halloween should be about creating magical memories for your LO not about babysitting your grown sister and catering to her delusions. Tell your mom she can either take her to a couple houses herself (if she dares) or else Bee can stay in and do other Halloween related activities. Maybe hand out candy instead.", "NTA! \n\nAny chance of her \u201cwigging\u201d out is too high, around not only your child but all the others in the neighbourhood. \n\nWhat would happen if another child approached and tried to touch \u201cher baby\u201d (that the kid would just see as a stuffed toy)?", "NTA. A real option: can you take your daughter trick or treating first, then have Elle and Bee join you later or even take Elle/Bee separately? (Can someone watch your daughter for a bit at home?)", "Absolutely NTA. Your mom is treating you and your daughter as toys for your sister\u2026 thing is you ARE real and matter as much as Elle.\n\nMy sister is schizophrenic too and I still act as her carer at times. This is a silly, risk ridden idea. Say no", "LOL.  NTA.  But you'll get more candy from people out of pity or fear.  You'll also be the talk of the neighborhood.", "Agree. Trick or treating sounds like absolutely the wrong environment to take her out in, especially with your daughter", "Oh hell no. Do not let her around your child.", "NTA Oh, schizophrenia is really complicated but I really like how you didn't say anything bad about your sister. You sound like a really calm person and I think that is awesome. \n\nPut your kid first and create sweet memories with her, you deserve to spend that night without worrying about what your sister Is going to do. Please remember that you are as important as your sister.", "NTA. But speaking as a person with schizophrenia, you really need to reevaluate the way you view and interact with your sister. Especially when trying to give her \u201creality checks.\u201d", "This.", "But Elle isn\u2019t the one trick or treating - Bee is! And Bee is a child! \n\nYou see the issue. Elle may be an adult, but she is not thinking rationally. She can\u2019t. Within her delusion she is being a good mom by taking Bee trick or treating. The reality\u2026 is really irrelevant as far as Elle is concerned.", "I think you are right but Elle doesn't think that she will be the one trick or treating, she thinks that Bee is the one that will go trick or treating. \n\nStill, op should put herself first.", "While, yes, disabled people are more likely to experience violence than perpetrate it, the risk calculus is different in this case. For one thing, it sounds like the schizophrenia isn't well controlled, and trick or treating is likely to result in a lot of frustrating situations (which is when a violent episode is most likely) where people, a bunch of whom will be kids, don't buy into the delusion, both of these are things that increase the likelihood of violence. Then, the meth use *substantially* increases the likelihood of a violent episode. It would be hard to set up a situation more likely to end in a violent episode if you tried, and that episode would happen around people who don't know about the danger and didn't consent to be put in that situation. Those people would, again, mostly be kids. \n\nAbelism sucks, but I think an overlooked type of abelism is telling people that they should feel bad about not being included in situations that would be setting people up to fail. It happens with autistic kids whose parents throw a fit when they're asked not to bring them to places that pretty much guarantee a meltdown. It makes the kids feel like they need to go and fight to be included, even though going will be excruciating, which in turn sets up a shame spiral for the kid, etc. etc", "Call me ableist, don't give a shit, I'm not hanging out with a schizophrenic meth head especially with a 4 year old in the mix.", "I think a lot of people are more assuming she\u2019s dangerous b/c of the whole meth thing and not the schizophrenia thing.", "Explain you don\u2019t have the mental and physical capacity to take a mentally unstable person out trick or treating . You are not going to deprive your daughter of this experience to cater to your mother and your sister, your child always comes first. I\u2019d also be concerned about the reaction you will get from others when an adult with a toy in a stroller wants candy.  I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s going to make people uncomfortable maybe enough to call the authorities. Tell your mom no, this is a bad idea and your child deserves to enjoy Halloween with you. Though what does your sister doctor say??", "Oh no\u2026 NTA\u2026 quality time with your daughter \ud83e\udde1\ud83c\udf83\ud83e\udde1", "Is there a way to take your daughter earlier in the day/evening and then set up with a few people you know, who know your sisters situation, to take your sister to later on without your daughter present? So it's only \"safe\" people and places your sister is exposed to who aren't likely to freak your sister out or freak out if your sister goes off on one? Set a time of only an hour or an hour and a half out. Find a compromise of sorts? I totally understand your reluctance though and if you'd be unwilling to deal with this situation at all don't let anyone guilt you but if you are willing to try and find a way to make it work this would have been a way we'd have done it when I worked with clients like your sister. I definitely wouldn't be taking your sister and daughter out alone, together, though. Who knows if the nature of Halloween, the lighting, outfits, decorations, etc, may trigger your sister in any way, and your focus needs to be either fully on your sister or fully on your child. NTA.", "So she can take Elle to houses on one block and wait for her at the car. Then go home.", "When I first read the post I had the same idea. Seems like a win, win. But then I realized it is probably worse in the long run to reinforce her delusions. If you \"prep\" people to accept her child it will be way more devastating when an outsider calls her out. This is an awful situation to be stuck in. Any chance of taking your daughter out early and getting a bit of a temperature, and maybe a bit of the COVID?", "NTA.  Your mom, Elle, and Bee can stay in and bake Halloween -themed cupcakes.  Or trick or treat in a mall where walking is easier if they're really going to do it.", "While it\u2019s not your decision to let Elle go or not, it IS your decision to stop feeding this idea, which is what I think they\u2019re trying to tell you. If you let her come with you, you\u2019re enabling the delusion. And if Elle is so free in all the other regards, why couldn\u2019t she go around her block and come home alone?", "Isn\u2019t Halloween the most likely time for a person with potentially unmedicated schizophrenia to have an episode? Being surrounded by people in costumes, different levels of scary decorations, assholes pulling pranks, people setting off fireworks? There is no way I would feel safe taking responsibility someone who could easily be triggered into an episode by any of those things. I don\u2019t know if your sister\u2019s previous episodes have involved any level of violence, but what if she gets mistakes someone in a devil costume for a delusion and gets violent towards them? Best case, she falls off the wagon and starts using again. Worst case, someone ends up very, very hurt.\n\nNTA and I think you need to be extremely clear with your mother that enabling Elle to do anything on Halloween that isn\u2019t in a controlled, supervised environment could be extremely dangerous for your sister, your mom, your daughter, yourself, and the public.", "But the insight matters, my sister will question delusions and often even realise some of her voices aren\u2019t real. Unmedicated, she always ends up believing things fully and becoming institutionalised", "Yup...or hit up one of the harvest carnivals/Trunk or Treats/etc that a lot of religious congregations and the like hold."]}
