Sometimes we\u2019re good and other times if we\u2019re together we just get into arguments and disagreements we aren\u2019t able to get passed. Last year I got engaged and hosted a brunch with my older sister, younger sister and my fianc\u00e9s sisters( he has 3). \n\nThe day of the brunch comes and my sister says she won\u2019t make it because our mom was out of town and there\u2019s no one to watch my niece. I told her my fianc\u00e9 could watch her and she said no my niece wouldn\u2019t stay with him. ( which is a lie because my niece and my fianc\u00e9 are cool and she likes to play with our dogs). \nThe day after the brunch I told my sister that I was disappointed that she didn\u2019t come or make an effort to stop by to meet my fianc\u00e9s sisters which was the point of the brunch. I also said I didn\u2019t want to hang out with her anymore if it meant that my mom is the only person that can watch my niece.\nInstead of an apology or trying to make it up to me,  my sister said \u201chow disgusting of you to think I would leave my child with someone I don\u2019t know\u201d. Her comment was insulting because my fianc\u00e9 has not only been good to me but he\u2019s been a very good person to my family and has even helped my older sister.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t show up to family events if she knows I\u2019ll be there or let me hang out with my niece. My niece had a dance recital that she wasn\u2019t planning on telling me about then my sister last minute invited me on Thursday to the recital that was on Saturday and an hour away but I still showed up. \n\nNow my parents, little sister, Aunt, grandma and even my god father keep trying to speak to me and get me to change my mind about inviting my sister to my wedding so that my niece can be a flower girl because she really wants to. I would love for my niece to be a flower girl but I do not want my sister at my wedding if she\u2019s not willing to apologize. \n\nI reached out to my sister and said if she\u2019s willing to apologize for her comments and the way she\u2019s acted I\u2019ll put it all behind me and invite her to my wedding so that my niece can be a flower girl. My sister said she won\u2019t apologize for letting someone she doesn\u2019t know and isn\u2019t comfortable with watching her child. She said she didn\u2019t know him then still doesn\u2019t know him now and my fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t watch my niece unsupervised. I even asked my sister if she would let my mom bring my niece to my wedding and she said no. \n\nMy wedding is less than 2 months away and I would like to have a flower girl but my family is mad at me because I\u2019m asking other family members to fill in. My mom literally said \u201c I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS TO YOUR NIECE THE PERSON YOU WERE FIGHTING FOR\u201d when I did everything I can do and my sister is the one who isn\u2019t allowing my niece to come. \n\nAITA for standing my ground and not allowing my family to force me into inviting my sister just so my niece can be a flower girl?", "created_utc": 1693070271, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1620wps/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sister_to_my_wedding/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Likewise, giving an ultimatum saying people other than your mom have to watch your niece in order for you to hang out with your sister is just weird.\n\nWas your sister's response rude? Yes. Were you also out of line? Yes. This sounds like a typical sibling agree to disagree situation you took personally bc she refused your fianc\u00e9. Your mom is right.

She had a boundary and you keep trying to force her to do what you wanted. It's her decision who she allows to be alone with her daughter. You decided she is not supportive of your relationship when she said she isn't comfortable having your fianc\u00e9 babysit her daughter. One thing has nothing to do with the other, but you decided to take offense. \n\n>I even asked my sister if she would let my mom bring my niece to my wedding and she said no. \n\nThis is ridiculous. If your sister is unwelcome, why should she let you take her daughter?\n\n>when I did everything I can do and my sister is the one who isn\u2019t allowing my niece to come\n\nNo. You didn't. You didn't respect her decision as a parent, you decided to be offended she wasn't comfortable with your fianc\u00e9 looking after her daughter, and you decided to cut her off but still expect access to her daughter. Then you kept saying that she should apologize for not trusting your future husband to be alone with her daughter, or to let someone take her daughter from her so you can have what you want.", "YTA.

There have been too many stories out there where a mother has been too trusting to men they don\u2019t really know in depth, even family and it\u2019s gone wrong.

And think about the rest of your family (mum, sister, niece) having to watch the family they raised/grew up with torn apart all because your sister didn't come to brunch.\n\nI'd start practicing your response for when you're asked 50 times on the wedding day \"Where are sister and niece?\".

She said she doesn't know your fiance well enough to leave her child with him and she has every right to decide who her daughter is babysat by. You're an entitled brat", "YTA. It was a pretty minor thing to disinvite someone over. Your sister is the parent and gets to decide who watches her children for whatever reason she thinks is appropriate. Parents and children are package deals. It's inappropriate to invite a minor child or expect her to have a role in your wedding without getting the parent involved.

Not your prerogative. I don\u2019t see what ground is.", "YTA\n\nYou took a childcare situation personally. She knows her kid better than you do. She is not obligated to leave her child with your fiance just because you love him. There are a lot of people I know who are decent people, but I wouldn't have left my 3 year old with them. Being a good person doesn't mean you're good with kids. Even if you're good with kids, that doesn't mean you'll be good with MY kid. \n\nThere are a thousand reasons she might not want him to watch her kid that have nothing to do with her judgement of him as a human being. Does your fiance really know how to deal gently with a 3 yo potty accident? Will he accidentally scare her by being too loud? (My husband, a hands-on father who can babywear, change diapers, wrangle kids, etc.  has a loud voice, and one of our friends' kids was scared of him for awhile). Is she a shy kid who needs a lot of time to warm up to people? Does he know how to use a carset correctly if he needs to trasnport her? Does he understand he food allergies if she has any? Will she feel comfortable telling him she's hurt or feeling sick? \n\nYour sister wasn't willing to make her kid uncomfortable with someone she doesn't know well.  That's not a crime. It also doesn't mean she doesn't like you or your fiance.\n\nIt just means her kid's well being is more important than your brunch. That's called being a parent.", "Let me get this straight. Because your sister didn't want your fiance's babysitting services, you've gone NC with her?\n\nI'm very fond of my BILs. I still wouldn't let them babysit solo because they are not experienced childcarers, I only know them in a casual friendly way rather than being in a close trusting relationship with them, and my kid would not know them well AT ALL to suddenly be left in their care.\n\nYOU know your partner is trustworthy - it's okay the rest of the world doesn't, and wouldn't be willing to bet their kids' safety and wellbeing on a mild acquaintance.\n\nNot that this all matters, really. You simply don't get to police your sister's babysitting decisions and punish her for not going where you want and doing what you want. Period.\n\nYTA, you don't now get access to someone's kid after disrespecting them and their parenting choices. As for your sister, if I were her, I wouldn't want to go to your wedding after this anyway, and I would be relieved to have a reason to keep my kid from this kind of emotional manipulation.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your place to decide who is acceptable as a babysitter for your sisters daughter and who isn't.\n\nIt is a BIG difference to leave the niece alone with your fiance than her to be there in a family setting.", "Yeeeaaah, I wouldn't leave my daughter with a man I barely know, either. YTA. You may know and love him, but your older sister doesn't.", "I think the actual issue is you being frustrated that she doesn't actually make the effort to make or keep plans with you especially considering the lengths you go to in order to be there for her/your niece. Like yes, you wished she would have just shown up to brunch and allowed your fianc\u00e9 to watch her but really it was the message that it sent you that she doesn't care all that much to be there for you as a sister.

I suspect heavily there is more to this story with her though and she does not owe you an apology, you do owe her one, when it comes to the brunch but the events since then lead me to think there is huge underlying issues with your relationship with your sister which would be reason enough not to invite her to your wedding. Your sister is then weaponizing your niece against you because of your strained relationship with her by refusing to let a TRUSTED family member take your niece who would be responsible for her  in the form of your mom, so no its not just about not trusting your fiance to babysit, she does not trust him to be around her daughter.  \n\n\nWill she expect family to exclude him from future events because she does not want him near her daughter?  \n\n\nIf this is her boundry so be it but make it clear to her and to family she is the one making that choice.

And, she was part of our wedding party because she is important to my husband and is part of our family.\n\nThere's also a different level of comfort necessary for watching your child. My ILs are good people, but they had different ideas about parenting, and weren't always respectful of our choices. So, I didn't feel comfortable leaving my children as babies with them alone because I didn't trust them to understand/follow our instructions. When the kids were older, they were great grandparents and I felt fine leaving the kids with them. \n\nYou seem really petty, tbh.", "Omg get a new line. How many times have you copy and pasted this comment that does nothing to make you look like less of an AH?", "You're making yourself look worse and I feel sorry for your fiance. Your sister doesn't want to leave her young daughter with a man and you refuse to respect her as a parent. I hope your entire family sides with your sister and stay home rather than condone your behavior by attending your wedding. Beyond selfish and you clearly don't care about anyone but yourself.", "Not helping your case no matter how many times you copy and paste this!", "INFO: how have you and/or your sister taken steps so that she would be able to get to know your fianc\u00e9 better? Also, do you know if/who your sister trusts to watch your niece? \n\nYou keep copying and pasting the same thing over and over but in this case it in no way answered the questions posed. The \u201cproviding additional info\u201d doesn\u2019t actually provide additional info here. \n\nEdited for clarity.", "Like i said she should at least let mom bring her daughter to the wedding, as daughter has no fault whatsoever in what happened. But you both seem... not suited to have a good relationship. I'm sure you're both good people, but together you don't mesh. It happens. That being said, are you absolutely sure you want to deal with all the drama of not inviting her to the wedding?? I don't mean from her, i mean from the rest of the family? If you can, then don't invite her and that's that.", "OP cut contact first, and then expected to see her niece without the presence of her mother. Fucking crazy.", "I am not saying she was right about the babysitting thing. OP offered, sister said no, OP didn't respect that. That's not right BUT that does not mean OPs sister was justified in her behavior towards OP before and after this brunch incident. \n\nOPs sister has known this man for 5 years. OP has stated that the fiance has helped out the sister (I am assuming at least financially) and suddenly the sister is pitching a fit and saying she  doesn't know this man. He has been around for half a decade, no one else seems to have a problem with him, he has been to family functions and has probably played with his soon to be niece countless times. \n\nDon't you think it's a bit disrespectful of the sister to act like this? OP has also stated she and finance are having a small intimate wedding. Would you want someone who treats you and the person you are about to marry like this? I know I wouldn't.", "Nope, I sure don't. He could have helped her sister move a couch for all we know. Her sister said no to the fiance watching her young daughter and she doesn't have to explain herself for it. No is a complete sentence. OP lost her shit for not getting her way and, rather than fight with OP, sister chose to go NC. OP is acting entitled and incredibly selfish. If I had a young daughter, I wouldn't trust any man to care for her either. It's better safe than sorry imo.", "I agree with you about the sister refusing to leave her child with him and OP throwing a fit over it. It was childish and disrespectful.  I was also in that situation when my child was about that age. I said no and it was not agreed with but I  did not suddenly act like this person was a dangerous stranger who I hadn't known for 5 years. \n\nAs for the rest of it we'll just have to respectfully agree to disagree.", "She didn't act like that she said no, I don't feel like I know him well enough to be comfortable. Saying I don't know him, to me, means I don't know him well enough to be comfortable. OP is reaping the consequences of throwing her tantrum.", "I don't agree but we'll just have to live with it"]}
