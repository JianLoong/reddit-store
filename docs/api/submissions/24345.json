This determines whether they keep their license or not. I told the manager what was going on and she started to make the necessary changes to become compliant. This really upset this stylist as well as her friends, coworkers, in the spa. They held a private meeting without our knowledge with the managers boss about us and without our knowledge. My immediate manager quit as a result and I the only one left and they clearly want me gone. I am documenting everything to file professional complaints on this stylist and on the business license of the spa. I am also writing a complaint to HR and and letting the corporate head of all spas in the country know what is going on. They recently did a tour of our location and told the manager the spa needed to be totally revamped talking about the staff. Hours would be extended and current staff would have hours cut.
