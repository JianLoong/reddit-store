Yes, there is a one year rule. It is (was?) considered rude to have 2 siblings married w/i the same 12 month period, NOT because you are stealing someone else's thunder, but b/c it is asking a lot of guests, since weddings (and showers) are expensive to attend for your guests and it comes off as a gift grab.\n\nI understand your desire for speed, but you need to understand this will be a lot of added time/stress/expense on your fiance's parents and any of the other people that will be attending both weddings (8 people?). Even if you are paying for the wedding 100% yourselves, there is a lot of extra for that group of people. Your fiance's brother likely not have the time or the money to be a groomsman or go to the bachelor party, for example. Your finances mother will have to buy 2 MOG dresses. If the older relatives need help getting to and from places, then you are asking their caregivers to deal with making a lot of arrangements twice in a short period of time.

Weddings are so expensive now and the current focus on \"the perfect wedding\" has made it so that people do feel slighted about having a sibling or close friend's wedding so close (social media, I'm blaming you). Although the feeling may not be necessarily valid, it is becoming more and more prelevant, and there will be a lot of people who agree that 3 months is too close. You will have to deal with that.\n\nRelated point: You are throwing a large wedding right after their small one. It really is a form of upstaging, intentional or not.\n\nSummary:\nOffically, you are not TA for having the wedding so close.

Auntie + uncle, grandmother + grandfather will be attending both weddings. \n\n(his grandparents are happy and excited, only ones mind) \n\nThey all live 40 minutes from our venue funnily enough thinking about it they have the least distance to go after us. \n\nWe aren\u2019t asking for gifts just donations to charities if people wish. We also aren\u2019t having wedding parties, no groomsmen or bridesmaids/ no hen dos or stags (just because they are expensive for what they are in my opinion and I\u2019d rather my friends save their money) \n\nWe hadn\u2019t planned on asking anyone to do anything really it hadn\u2019t crossed my mind. But we are paying for their photographer as a wedding gift on their day (although they haven\u2019t mentioned it I should probably ask if they still want us to) \n\nI guess it could be seen that way as it\u2019s a big wedding following theirs that is probably why they are upset it\u2019s not being done out of spite or to flaunt anything though. Literally just to bring our family and friends together for good old knees up and to have a nice time sadly many of my family are entering their golden years and i don\u2019t want to risk them not making it.", "Make sure that the dress you wear to your brother's wedding isnt remotely close to a white colour.", "That\u2019s just not practical, especially since Covid. There\u2019s 5 of us in my family with siblings and cousins we are close to all within about 3 years of age. All went to Uni, met people then Covid paused any engagement/wedding plans. We all got engaged within about a year of each other and you can\u2019t expect to space out the weddings for 2-5 years so we\u2019re a few months apart, it\u2019s not an issue at all", "I did not mean you had to try asap. But if you want to marry in November 24. And then start trying. That would make you loose almost 18 months. But you both need to do what feels best. I wish that you will have a great wedding and after a beautiful child together.", "Your MIL will definitely feel she has to buy a 2nd dress and she will definitely NOT want to be in the same dress for both sets of wedding photos, not to mention soon to be BIL/SIL will want as much visual seperation between the weddings as possible.\n\nI understand your thought process, but it doesn't mean everyone involved knows/understands there won't be other commitments (time/expense) etc. Also, people of your parent's generation and older WILL feel obligated to buy gifts and so will close family - I speak from experience on this. There is no way his parent's won't be giving you a gift and if they are decent parents, they will want the gift to equal the brother's.\n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if the upstaging is intentional or not, it is the unfortunate reality of the situation that your future BIL/SIL may be hurt by this, even if they understand you didn't do it intentionally.\n\nSo yeah, this is an unforced error. Again, it sounds like you aren't an AH for this, but it doesn't mean there won't be some resentment that you will have to deal with for planning a wedding so close. \n\nYour MIL told you politely what she thought of the situation. No one is demanding anything, they would be AH's if they did. Ultimately, though, this isn't a good look from his side of the family's perspective, and they aren't out of line for thinking it isn't a good look. I think you really should have talked this over with them before setting a date.", "Um\u2026yes\u2026taking such a long engagement AND insisting no one gets married before them or a year after them seems pretty unfair. Perfect if this schedule works for them, but why would OP put her life on hold for them!?", "I remember reading a story here where all 5 siblings had to wait til the siblings older then them got married then the youngest got tired of waiting.", "Right?? I would probably add to the post that this year was already vetoed!", "Yikes - I empathize with him as well. But that's all the more reason for him to look after his own happiness now first and foremost.\n\nOh yeah, and obviously NTA", "I hear you. But that should work both ways, fiances brother ideally also wouldn\u2019t want to loose him over this. Otherwise the problem will just shift to the next big life event - who gets pregnant first, fights about baby names, dates for baby showers, gender reveals\u2026whatever else there is to come", "Thank you. Yes he does need to put himself first. This is all quite fresh so I\u2019m hoping after a few weeks of processing he\u2019ll realise it.", "NTA. They don\u2019t call it \u201cwedding season\u201d for nothing. No one has a monopoly on wedding dates, venues, dresses, vendors, etc. People really need to understand that they\u2019re the only ones who are totally invested in the day.

It was appropriate of you to schedule your wedding after his brother's-- and if it's a destination wedding or a wedding where most of the guests to to both events will have to travel then a buffer of 6 - 8 weeks is more common.  You only have a handful of common guests (which seems unusual but whatever) and 3 moths is a perfectly acceptable buffer.  ENJOY YOUR DAY", "Do your thing.  Guests can come or not.  They can B\\*\\*\\*\\* about it or not.  Who cares.  Wedding guests don't really give a hoot about who was first, who was there, etc.  When I go to a wedding, even people I love dearly,  I am usually blasting out the door with my hair on fire hoping I have the right address.   No-one cares they are within 3 months.  Plus, your brother's wedding is first.  So, how could you POSSIBLY be stealing their \"wedding thunder.\"    I can't believe people are so weird and insecure about weddings.  Just marry the woman you love when you want to.  And then live your life well.  Congrats and have fun.", "NTA.\n\nMy SIL got married late August and my wife and I got married early November of the same year. It was during covid so from what I know about the venue they are booked solid for 2+ years now.  \n\nThey can have their wedding day but they can\u2019t have yours.", "NTA\n\nMy brother and I got engaged 1 night apart and married 1 week apart. His wedding was large on the 19th and mine was a lot smaller on the 26th. No one had any problems and did not compare our weddings.", "NTA\n\nI'm calling the entire next year for my wedding so no one can get engaged, pregnant, divorced or die in order to not steal my spotlight.  Now I'm not engaged, have no intention of ever marrying but gosh darn it - I heard that's the way it works, right?", "Given the circumstances, I would say NAH. But I do think it\u2019s generally a good rule not to get married the same year as your siblings, if you can avoid it. At the very least you should give it 6 months. Even if there are only a few people attending both, it\u2019s a lot on the parents.", "NTA.\nIt's 3 months later. Not 3 days.\nThey're being ridiculous and greedy.\nPeople typically forget about someone else's wedding in 3 hours because they're too drunk to even care.", "NTA they can't book out the year. you're giving them s whole season. they are in high summer you're in late fall. heck you're going to clash with thanksgiving before you clash with them.", "NTA.. tell these AH to grow up", "Get married in August! I never heard something like - Siblings don\u2019t get married in the same year! It\u2019s your wedding and you do what you want. They will get over it and if they don\u2019t- I wouldn\u2019t want them around. That\u2019s ridiculous, if other family members are comparing \u201cwedding days\u201d than they don\u2019t have much to think about. Your Not The Ass", "NTA at all. I got married in the same year as my wife\u2019s brother and my own brother. BIL got married in the winter, wife and I got married in the summer and my brother got married in the fall. It made for a busy year but no one was trying to steal anyone\u2019s thunder.", "NTA. The thing about forgetting their wedding made me laugh. I forget weddings the minute they\u2019re over. I\u2019d prefer to forget them beforehand but friends might be a tad miffed.", "NTA\n\nIt is 3 months later with mostly different guests. It is fine.\n\nWho compares weddings anyway? Like \u201cBob and Jill got married better than Joe and David. I can\u2019t believe we suffered through their substandard event 3 months ago. I\u2019m going to demand our toaster back! They are off the Christmas card list!\u201d", "NTA, 3 months is plenty of time. No one will be forced to choose between one or the other. The weddings will be in completely different seasons. That\u2019s like saying you can\u2019t throw an party for Easter because it will upstage someone else\u2019s Christmas party. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "It's a hard situation. Normally I'd say it's inconsiderate of family members who need to travel to do both weddings in the same year (obviously doesn't apply if all your family lives locally). But ageing family members can also make it time sensitive. I don't think you're doing anything wrong exactly, bi I also don't think they're wrong to be upset.

I had 2 weddings of 2 siblings within 3 months like this and it was a constant comparison of X's wedding was like this and Y's was like that.\n\nI also think it's a lot to ask of the guests who may have to travel to both weddings, buy gifts, hotel, outfits, etc.", "I can understand why it might be a problem getting married in the same MONTH, especially if people have to travel but if I were them I'd be perfectly happy with 3 months of space.", "Eh, it can be annoying.  My brother just planned his wedding 2 months before mine.  It\u2019s enough time and I\u2019m happy for him but it puts people in a rough spot.  Lots of family need to travel for both and traveling is very expensive right now.  Asking all my cousins to fly there families across the country twice that quickly sucks for them.  \n\nStill though, NTA.", "Same. It's in poor taste to do them weekend to weekend, sometimes \"in the same month\" is mentioned but same year? Fuck off with that nonsense. My father's family is *old money wealthy*, and not a single one of them said anything except when my father and his cousin got married in the same month as half the family is military and there were some issues with leave.", "I know it was uncommon for sisters to marry in the same year (unless it was a double wedding) in the early to mid 1900s when the bride's parents were expected to pay for the wedding and reception and the buffer was for financial reasons.", "My brother/SIL missed my wedding because their second child was born the day before. It truly didn't matter to me because I love that baby more than anything. I know not everyone thinks like that, but don't postpone your family for someone else's wedding!", "Please don\u2019t wait another year+ to start trying if this is something you truly want. Not only is fertility declining, having a baby at 41 is exhausting.", "My family is *old money wealthy* there is no such thing as *no wedding in the same year* unless your bloody aristocrats, that's some absolute audacity. In the same month will get some eyebrows due to travel and time off requests but 3 months out? Tell them to take a hike and enjoy your wedding.\n\n\nAs for babies? Babies come when they come. Everyone can get out of the way and take a hike, even with IVF there is no other polite response than *oh we are so happy for you*.", "Only time it's not recommending is a state wedding of a close relation- aristocrats and political where the entire wedding planning takes over a year and your wedding *will* be overshadowed by everyone else and the traditions/costs associated with it will be overbearing on other family members. This is more \"oh I don't want to be married in June when my sister is being married in November because just the cost of attending her state wedding will be $$$$\" or \"we should move our wedding to the following year because my sister is being married in June and the blow out of our wedding will negatively impact hers\". That's also to just be in good taste its not a hard and fast rule.\n\n\nThis is according to my great-grandmother who once hosted premires and ambassadors but I think in the case of OP she and her husband are fine and his relations are being entitled shuts.", "Congratulations and thanks you x", "I've never heard of a bride feeling put out about a wedding that isn't even in the same season as hers!", "Thanks!
