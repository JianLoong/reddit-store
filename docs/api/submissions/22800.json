You and your fianc\u00e9e can deal with this, but this is her family, so she needs to take the lead on this, just as you should take the lead on any issues with your family.\n\nBut the FBIL should be asked: \"Which of these nine people will be making that comparison?\" \n\nTwo siblings getting married in the same year is superstition.

Don't schedule your lives around these people.", "NTA.

Your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother is being ridiculous", "Wedding culture is a mistake. These rules on who can marry and when? They came out of expectations that everyone needs to have fairytale weddings seen in 1980s-present films. They were only the place of the most super wealthy, now people go in stupid levels of debt they could be using for a home or starting a family, bring on intense stress and family hardship fighting over the details, and strain friendships with insane demands over bridesmaids and spacing and uniforms and whatnot. I sound like Abe Simpson, but in my day we often would have several weddings in our community a month and everyone attended all of them, at least in part. It was fine. People remembered their own fondly. Nobody compared except for the shitty people who would do that even if they were years apart.\n\nNTA, just hold your wedding. Someone will always be angry. People are always angry about weddings now. There is no escaping it.", "NTA. Out of courtesy, I would say that if you get married in the 4/5 month following close firneds or family, then don't go for the same venue if you want to be gracious about it. \nNow, this put aside, you have several months between both weddings, and sharing very few guests, and by the number of person attending, it seems like both weddings will have really different vibes. They have absolutely no reason to fear comparison.\n\nNow, depending on the relation you have with them, you might want to have a calm conversation with them on gow you think both wedding will be really different and as great as each other, just to try to appease them without moving your own date (which you should absolutely not do, you have no reason to).", "I\u2019m from SE Asia and we have a superstition that siblings should not marry within the same year because its bad luck.", "NTA exactly, but yeah, generally, with someone as closely related as a sibling, it's not polite to get married the same year. If they were a distant cousin or your nephew's daughter, it would be fine, but you should give it 6 months to a year between weddings for people in the same family unit. It sounds like the brother got his date first, so I'd pick a new date. (Anything in 2025 ought to do.)\n\nEdited to add a verdict.", "YTA\n\nNot for the wedding dates thing, that's fine.

There is also abandonment issues at play etc cause his dad was never in the picture his mum was never around and he was left to raise the others as the eldest but he\u2019s also the only one in his family who has had professional help to deal with it all.  So when he says he doesn\u2019t want to lose them I empathise with why he says that. \n\nThis feed was to try and show him that complete strangers are saying the same thing, but also I\u2019ve been so involved in this dispute that I was beginning to doubt myself."]}
