You can have 100 requests at a restaurant, doesn\u2019t make it appropriate when somebody has cooked a meal for you.\n\nIt is also considered rude by many people to add condiments and seasonings to a meal somebody has prepared for you, when you\u2019re a guest in their home.

Oh and I think it's not about how you like steaks :D :D\n\nOP says he is on the spectrum, so I shall be very detailed and explicit on the social stresses I think may be going on here. Note that if course I am extrapolating and projecting significantly here, but since my main advice is talking to GF ad nauseam, the true answer is offline anyway :)\n\nYou have been seeing each other for 6 months, but are only official recently, so this sounds to me like you are the first time hosting, and on top of that, her family is there, and you, a guy in a heterosexual couple,  are 4 years her junior . there is nothing actually anything wrong with the age thing, it's just less common, as Ms are perceived as maturing slower than Fs, so it just heightens everyone's attentions being paid. \n\nWhen I meet a friend's or siblings significant other, all I care about is how they treat my friend or sibling. And the interaction you describe would easily fit the any-signs-of-disrespect I am looking out for. Actually, the use of the term 'serving' in the title already rung my alarm bells. Bluntly, you interacted with her like with a food worker at a buffet. Nicely and politely, but not on social currency, but as if it was her job to prepare the food to your liking.\n\nIf I was her dad or sister in this situation, I would not like that at all, as it would hint at an unbalanced relationship (a bit like - you are an entitled little kid, seeing her perhaps as a servile mum-replacement, now an equal partner) and think less of you for it.\nIf I was her, I would be feeling embarrassed, knowing that what I just described was going through my family's head. And I would already be stressed because I am dealing with all these food things and all those people interactions, and my newly-official BF doing something unexpected that paints our relationship in a light that I don't like, and presumably isn't true.\n\nNote that in none of this it matters what your intention was, but how it looked to other people, as this was likely not a 'just chilling' social situation, but one where she had something to show/portray/perform regarding your new relationship.\n\nMy recommendation is lots of direct talking to each other. That is based on my experience as a somewhat socially anxious person having been in a relationship with a person on the autism spectrum. Like, if we went into a situation that I found already tricky or that I vulnerable in and we didn't game-plan it before, you bet I got stressed and annoyed by something they did that made the situation harder for me, while they were rather clueless about what was going on. \n\nHowever, by putting in the work ahead of time, game planning and coming up with some code words to signal to them explicitly what was going on in my perception/head (I wanted them to know but not the other people involved), we navigated the situations as a team and made both our lives easier than they were without each other.\n\nTL;DR: talk it out in detail until you fully understand what was going on and then turn the need for all that talking into a superpower and thrive from here on out :)\n\nOh yes, also do try that steak with butter and herbs, sounds delicious!", "I'm going with NTA.  GF was grilling steak with butter herbs on it.  OP didn't want butter and herbs so he asked GF not to put it on his.  This isn't in any way rude to the chef.  It isn't giving the chef one second of extra work.  It isn't telling the chef to run inside and rustle up a bowl of pasta carbonara; it's just asking her not to season his steak -- it's actually easier for her to do this than to season the damned steak.\n\nIt worries me that GF is unwilling to make this simple accommodation to the OP's food preferences.  And that she'd criticize him for expressing his preferences.  (It's not like he went, \"Ewww, gag me with a spoon.  Butter on steak!  Disgusting!!!  Don't ruin my steak with it,\" he said, \"May I please have mine without butter and herbs?\"  Seems fine to me.)\n\nIt seems like GF's position reflects a my way or the highway kind of rigidity that I very much hope isn't reflected in other areas of their lives together.\n\nOtherwise we're looking at a ketsup-colored flag.", "NAH but why not try it, it\u2019s delicious and honestly I almost went with YTA for putting ketchup on it.

I suspect she knows something is a little different with me, she calls me \u201cMr. Habit Rabbit\u201d and also will do things for me and add \u201cand I did it the way you like it!\u201d As a gesture of affection. It\u2019s part of what made the food thing weird. She\u2019s never taken issue to my plain food habits before.", "Also there\u2019s nothing wrong with adding ketchup to your steak afterwards . . . . . I\u2019m a simple ketchup-on-everything kind of gal myself, but I promise you, even if I just want ketchup on my steak, it never hurts to add some extra butter and herbs first!! Absolutely delicious and usually makes the ketchup unnecessary, though perhaps not unwanted lol", "The trick is to split your meal in 2 and have the new seasoning on one half and your safe option available for the other. If you like it, you add the new seasoning to the rest. If you don't, you add safe seasoning to the second half. \n\nYou're NTA, this is a legitimate accommodation for your autism and if they're this up in arms about such a minor request you might be in for a difficult road ahead. I suggest you sit down with her and explain that this is part of your autism. You're willing to expand your range of safe foods slowly but if you're going to be together long term she will need to be in your corner when it comes to accommodations.", "You've gotten great advice here OP. Sounds like you are going to try, and that's what's important. Also, apologize to your sweetie sincerely, and promise next time she makes steak, your going to try it.", "Well, I don't especially like being lectured about my identity or how i perceive myself. It is, in fact, for many people, a disability. Autism sometimes means people cannot talk or cannot care for themselves, may be so subject to meltdowns that they cannot engage effectively with other people, etc. Level three autism especially can be intensely disabling. Look, in a world where no one talks, being mute isn't a disability. In a world where people talk, it is a disability. Disability isn't an insult, it acknowledges that there are unique challenges that need to be accommodated. Autism needs to be accommodated. \n\n\nAnd yeah, some people DO see it as a burden on their lives, including sometimes me, and that is allowed. I can both love myself and really struggle with this. And I'd rather have people who struggle at the table rather than be driven out so all we hear is proud voices, because frankly diverse voices are beneficial. You'd rather shame people who struggle with their autism until either they consider themselves \"not ok\" as community advocates or until they fall in line with your prescriptive vision of how it's ok to understand oneself? \n\n\nI DO understand what I'm saying, and I find it condescending that you have decided I must not. Like I say, there are people who work in the line of advocacy who specifically validate person first language. It's not up to you how people handle their identity. My identity is one of many facets, autism is one of them, and it doesn't always come first. \n\n\nYour capitalization is passive-aggressive and unnecessary in this situation. It would be a worthwhile if angry correction if I were objectively wrong (eg you were advocating for trans identities to be respected), though unlikely to defuse anything, but this is just as problematic as what you think you're crusading against. I hear your perspective, but all it's incited is defensiveness, and all it's accomplished is erasure of a valid perspective. This could have been productive discussion. The community is not and does not need to be a monolith.", "Same, but it pisses me off, imagen acting the way they do to us to any of the other groups that frequently get discriminated against, disgustingly ableism is the most ignored form of discrimination, at best an afterthought", "Legit adorable. You two sound so cute.\n\nYou\u2019re right, maybe it\u2019s her family pressuring her or something. When you talk to her you can always ask her if she\u2019s ok or if she was nervous about impressing her family or something. You never know!", "Love yourself and accept yourself for who you are, you are a wonderful brilliant autistic human being, please  take your anger elsewhere hun", ">Your capitalization is passive-aggressive and unnecessary in this situation.

I know she was fussing a lot before the BBQ about how her Dad wasn\u2019t going to like a woman on the grill and maybe she should have done a lasagna. But I encouraged her to just grill, she\u2019s been practicing. I know she\u2019s been practicing because she texts me a lot about her work lunches being leftover steak all week (we only really see eachother every other weekend right now).", "Ok. The refrain of speaking over someone's experience refusing to listen, and then identifying me for me doesn't help. Neither does referring to me as hun. I'm angry because you're not listening. I can love and accept myself and still not always prefer identity first language, and you handing me an identity doesn't help. What you're doing actually makes it worse, because you're refusing to hear my personhood and experience. When we yell at people for refusing to listen to the community, it also includes this: refusing to consider a diversity of voices.", "YO. this is completely unnecessary. I am jewish, I'm queer, I'm liberal as shit, and you do NOT get to decide what I am first and foremost. Our experience outlines us and informs us but does not define us. We are individuals, and the world is not a prescription. You are welcome to see yourself as autistic before anything else and hang your experience and self as ornamentation on that. I don't view that as affirming, and it's absurd to continue telling others people how to view themselves.", "Okay hun I think you're getting a wee bit stressed so it might be time to walk away, I hope you grow and accept yourself one day \ud83d\udc97", "Hun out of all those things I'm gonna guess you were acting autistic before you're were reading the Torah or waving rainbow flags around, you're a good example of the horse shoe effect, you're so far left that you're leaning right and you just don't know it", ">. I am jewish, I'm queer, I'm liberal as shit,\n\nAre you sure you're not a person with queerness or a person with Jewish beliefs or a human of liberal aligning. Nope you're an autistic Jewish queer person and congratulations for that we accept you we just wish you would too"]}
