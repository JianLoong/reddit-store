You can have 100 requests at a restaurant, doesn\u2019t make it appropriate when somebody has cooked a meal for you.\n\nIt is also considered rude by many people to add condiments and seasonings to a meal somebody has prepared for you, when you\u2019re a guest in their home.

Oh and I think it's not about how you like steaks :D :D\n\nOP says he is on the spectrum, so I shall be very detailed and explicit on the social stresses I think may be going on here. Note that if course I am extrapolating and projecting significantly here, but since my main advice is talking to GF ad nauseam, the true answer is offline anyway :)\n\nYou have been seeing each other for 6 months, but are only official recently, so this sounds to me like you are the first time hosting, and on top of that, her family is there, and you, a guy in a heterosexual couple,  are 4 years her junior . there is nothing actually anything wrong with the age thing, it's just less common, as Ms are perceived as maturing slower than Fs, so it just heightens everyone's attentions being paid. \n\nWhen I meet a friend's or siblings significant other, all I care about is how they treat my friend or sibling. And the interaction you describe would easily fit the any-signs-of-disrespect I am looking out for. Actually, the use of the term 'serving' in the title already rung my alarm bells. Bluntly, you interacted with her like with a food worker at a buffet. Nicely and politely, but not on social currency, but as if it was her job to prepare the food to your liking.\n\nIf I was her dad or sister in this situation, I would not like that at all, as it would hint at an unbalanced relationship (a bit like - you are an entitled little kid, seeing her perhaps as a servile mum-replacement, now an equal partner) and think less of you for it.\nIf I was her, I would be feeling embarrassed, knowing that what I just described was going through my family's head. And I would already be stressed because I am dealing with all these food things and all those people interactions, and my newly-official BF doing something unexpected that paints our relationship in a light that I don't like, and presumably isn't true.\n\nNote that in none of this it matters what your intention was, but how it looked to other people, as this was likely not a 'just chilling' social situation, but one where she had something to show/portray/perform regarding your new relationship.\n\nMy recommendation is lots of direct talking to each other. That is based on my experience as a somewhat socially anxious person having been in a relationship with a person on the autism spectrum. Like, if we went into a situation that I found already tricky or that I vulnerable in and we didn't game-plan it before, you bet I got stressed and annoyed by something they did that made the situation harder for me, while they were rather clueless about what was going on. \n\nHowever, by putting in the work ahead of time, game planning and coming up with some code words to signal to them explicitly what was going on in my perception/head (I wanted them to know but not the other people involved), we navigated the situations as a team and made both our lives easier than they were without each other.\n\nTL;DR: talk it out in detail until you fully understand what was going on and then turn the need for all that talking into a superpower and thrive from here on out :)\n\nOh yes, also do try that steak with butter and herbs, sounds delicious!", "I'm going with NTA.  GF was grilling steak with butter herbs on it.  OP didn't want butter and herbs so he asked GF not to put it on his.  This isn't in any way rude to the chef.  It isn't giving the chef one second of extra work.  It isn't telling the chef to run inside and rustle up a bowl of pasta carbonara; it's just asking her not to season his steak -- it's actually easier for her to do this than to season the damned steak.\n\nIt worries me that GF is unwilling to make this simple accommodation to the OP's food preferences.  And that she'd criticize him for expressing his preferences.  (It's not like he went, \"Ewww, gag me with a spoon.  Butter on steak!  Disgusting!!!  Don't ruin my steak with it,\" he said, \"May I please have mine without butter and herbs?\"  Seems fine to me.)\n\nIt seems like GF's position reflects a my way or the highway kind of rigidity that I very much hope isn't reflected in other areas of their lives together.\n\nOtherwise we're looking at a ketsup-colored flag.", "NAH but why not try it, it\u2019s delicious and honestly I almost went with YTA for putting ketchup on it.

And I am a little neurodivergent myself. I agree that when a cheaper steak is cooked very thoroughly, ketchup is the only way to get it down. Ketchup is compensating for the flavor and texture. That\u2019s how I ate it as a kid too. But when someone is cooking a higher quality cut of meat, it has a really good flavor and texture that you might really like. Putting ketchup on expensive steaks is sort of equivalent to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, paying for a movie ticket and then spending the whole movie on your phone reading the plot summary and spoilers instead of watching it.

It\u2019s very possible he was rude about it or they haven\u2019t talked about it, but it being a surprise enough for her to be upset about it is kind of giving me pause. \n\nTo be fair to her I guess, my friend who I mentioned before didn\u2019t really twig the food thing until around the 6 month mark, because there were some things he would not eat and she got annoyed by it - so they talked! And she made the decision that she could cope with him not liking certain foods, she could still make and eat them herself. But it has to be talked about or it becomes a problem in a new relationship. \n\nNot everyone wants to be in a relationship with an autistic person with these kinds of issues (a \u2018food thing\u2019 is never going to be the only point on which the autist is quite rigid and particular/weird), and that\u2019s cool, but the only way you find out if it\u2019s a dealbreaker is by actually talking through \u2018things\u2019. (Personal anecdote: my most obvious aspie thing is I cannot eat with a fork that has uneven tines. They must be even or I cannot bring myself to eat with it. Low key drives me kinda mental. I can mask with the best of them and genuinely seem neurotypical, but if I\u2019m at dinner with family/friends and my fork is uneven, I give the game away immediately because I have to swap it \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m a rather mild case and I\u2019m female/diagnosed as an adult so I got more masking practice than most, but it totally ruins my mood and dramatically shortens my temper to have to \u2018just deal\u2019 with uneven tines. Someone who has it any worse than I do is very unlikely to be able to handle a specific \u2018thing\u2019. Men are often significantly worse at masking too.)", "It's plonking the second to last steak on a plate and leaving it untouched beside you while the others you garnish and hand out.

I know people like to look down on people for not having steak the \"right way\" but to me, adding butter to meat is also an unusual choice. I'm sure it was delicious.\n\nLet people like what they like, who gives a shit.", "If your GF is open to it you could start trying bits of her food prepared with ingredients you know you like in other meals (as above with butter and herbs) but keep yours plain. If it\u2019s something easy added on at the end like this if you like it you can have the same and if it\u2019s something that would have needed to be prepped differently earlier on then you can still have yours plain as planned but you\u2019ll know for next time if you like it. That way you\u2019re never stuck with a whole meal you hate or even that you might have anxiety you\u2019re going to hate but hopefully you\u2019ll discover some new things along the way. And I think using what you know you already like but in different ways might be an initial good start to try and branch out a bit, and if that goes well you could think about trying things that are similar (like if you like red peppers, try green for example). You can always cook in a way that the new thing is on the side - this is what we do when we cook for our young godson when he comes to stay rather than cooking a totally separate kid dinner, largely the same meal but \u2018split up\u2019 in to parts as much as possible (eg. sauce on the side, plain rice, plain prawns, veg cooked separately for what might be all mixed together on our plates). That way if he knows he likes rice and prawns he won\u2019t go hungry or be upset, he\u2019ll probably like the sauce or the veg but maybe not both but the whole meal isn\u2019t ruined if he doesn\u2019t like one part. Also, don\u2019t forget (because ASD food issues are sensory) that the texture of things can be wildly different depending on cooking style. Thought I hated green beans until I was in my late 20s when I had some and loved them and they now form part of my regular veg line up. But I saut\u00e9 them and until almost slightly charred. I went home to my mum\u2019s ages after starting to eat green beans and she cooked them for me for the first time since she gave up in childhood and\u2026.. yeah an undercooked boiled SQUEAKY green bean I can\u2019t stand! But you can use this knowledge to either introduce a new food that you don\u2019t think you like (swap texture to check if that was the issue) or use this to keep more things you know you like consistent so it\u2019s the minimal \u2018newness\u2019 and change possible. \n\nIt\u2019s great you want to try and branch out - hopefully you\u2019ll discover loads of new stuff you love which will be wonderful for you. There\u2019s also no getting round the fact it is socially (and practically) easier to not be a \u2018fussy eater\u2019 - even if that\u2019s just a case of knowing there\u2019s more you can tolerate without worrying about it or having to make changes to meals people are cooking you that\u2019s helpful - even if steak and ketchup is still your favourite. \n\nHowever, go at your own pace and know that if you don\u2019t manage to introduce any new foods then that doesn\u2019t make you a bad person or in the wrong. It\u2019s definitely good if you can do whatever is reasonable to make it easy for people to accommodate you, like offering to help if you\u2019ve added lots of steps or separate cooking to their agenda (and showing your loved ones it\u2019s something you\u2019re trying to improve if food is important to them and if your dietary restrictions make it hard to eat out for example is maybe part of that). But if anyone gets arsey remind people that they probably have things they hate too and how would they feel if you tried to insist it wouldn\u2019t be that big a deal for them to just eat that thing (pigs testicles anyone?).
