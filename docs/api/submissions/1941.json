{"id": 1941, "submission_id": "yraao1", "title": "AITA for telling my ex that his family called my husband an upgrade.", "selftext": "After I had my first child I had post partum depression. I had a hard time getting motivated to do anything. I was just a ball of emotions and tears.  My boyfriend was 25 at the time and he couldn't handle it.  So he left. His mom, Linda, took me in.  She took over taking care of my son and she helped me get therapy. She paid for the formula when I went on medication for my treatment and I couldn't breastfeed.  She quite literally held me while I cried, feeling useless as a mother and as a woman.  She was more of a mother to me than I had ever known before.  \n\nIt took a while but I balance out.  I got back to watching my child. When I went back to work my \"mom\" said that she would watch my son so he didn't have to go to daycare and cost me all the money I earned.  She knew her son was not paying child support.  She told me to go after him for it so I did.  Getting it made my life easier and I asked her if she wanted me to move out.  She said \"nope\". \n\nWhen my son was six, three years ago, I started talking to my now husband. He worked out at the gym where I went to get rid of all the weight I put on.  He had seen me there for years and had nodded and said hi but never approached me before.  He told me that he was really impressed by my commitment to my health and he asked me out.  I almost said no. I had only ever been with one guy and that was before the stretch marks and stuff.  \n\nLinda told me to go for it. \n\nSo, long story short, I am now married to a pretty great guy.  I'm working, and Linda  lives in our guest suite and takes care of my son before and after school.  She has even met a gentleman and has spent a few evenings out of the house.  LoL\n\nBecause of my relationship with her I am still part of her family. So several of them were invited to my wedding.  And they all called my husband an upgrade from my ex.\n\nSo last Sunday my ex was bringing my son back from his time with him and he asked if I ever thought about what our life would be if I hadn't gotten depressed. I snorted and said no. I never thought of him as anything other than a sperm donor. He said that his family had done a lot for me and that I should be grateful. I said that I was grateful TO THEM.  I said that all of them that were still in my life considered my husband an upgrade from him.  He got all butthurt that I said that and left.  \n\nHe called his mom and complained about what I said.  \n\nHer and I talked yesterday and she said that even though it was true it was hurtful and that I shouldn't have said it.  She seemed sad and I feel like shit for disappointing her.  \n\nI apologized to her and I called my ex and apologized to him. Sincerely. He called me an asshole for turning his family against him.  I guess he called other family members and they all said he wasn't as good for me as my husband. And a few were less complementary than that.  \n\nSo now I feel like crap for starting drama I could have avoided by keeping my big mouth shut. But it was so shocking to hear him ask about us when he left me without looking back.", "created_utc": 1668073225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yraao1/aita_for_telling_my_ex_that_his_family_called_my/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes you could have done better, but you apologized sincerely and that\u2019s all one can do in retrospect. Hopefully Linda will forgive you. \n\nYour ex however? F him and his \u201cwhat if you didn\u2019t get a very normal illness caused by carrying and delivering my child\u201d. Like seriously. F that guy lol. You didn\u2019t turn his family against him he did that to himself by being a massive A!", "This is justified asshole territory. When will that category be added to AITA? Linda sounds wonderful. She knows her son is an asshole. But sometimes it's not worth the drama even if it's true.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't start the drama. He did by asking a rather stupid question.  Maybe you shouldn't have mentioned the \"upgrade\", but you are only human and he was an idiot. \n\nYou apologized to his mom and even she knew what you said was true and so do other family members. He can only blame himself for running around complaining about what you said.", "Reluctantly I say ESH, becasue of how you worded it. I feel bad about this verdict, because the more you interact with him, the more he doubles down in his assholicity.\n\nI wish you many happy years in the future with your husband and child and your \"mom\". She sounds like an angel.", "ESH for how the argument went, but I\u2019ll give you a slight NTA in the end because you reached out afterwards to sincerely apologize. \n\nAs harsh as you were, you weren\u2019t exactly screaming about how awesome your new husband is to the wind. Your ex blew open your conversation by phoning in all of his other family members, and now he\u2019s mad that everyone else said the exact same thing you did. Sure, you didn\u2019t have to go low revealing the \u201cupgrade\u201d comment, but it\u2019s also his own fault for being such a deadbeat.", "NTA. He shouldn't ask questions he might not like the answers to", "NTA\n\nAny man willing to downplay mental illness and put the blame on women is an asshole. One piece of advice does not to compare your husband to your ex. That's hurting to your husband as you compare him to that low-levelled jerk ex. Next time say this: How would  our life would be if you did not leave me during my time of need and accepted your mistake .", "If you balance your hurtful words against his dumping you, you still come out as the better person, so I will say\n\nNTA.\n\nI do think he needed to hear this, as I am guessing he has not grown from the situation (otherwise, he would have apologized rather than asking you if you ever thought about him).", "NTA", "NTA. He left you when you had given birth and has postpartum depression. The audacity he has to even ask you that question after everything he put you and your child through. His mom is just sad because that\u2019s her son, but she knows he isn\u2019t a good person for what he had done to you. And the fact he says if YOU hadn\u2019t gotten depressed? He put a baby in you and he can\u2019t understand all that comes with a baby and after pregnancy? Like it was your choice to have postpartum depression?\nAlso, you didn\u2019t turn his family against him. He did that himself when he left you and your child.", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown man with a kid who called his mommy because you smacked him with facts in a convo he opened the door on. Oops.", "A not harsh YTA (I'm treating this as a conflict between you and your mum/MIL, rather than with your ex).\n\nYour ex was wrong, but you did drop your mother in it ans cause drama for her she didnt ask for.", "YTA it was unkind and unnecessary to say and betrayed the confidence of people who had been lovely to.\n\nYou only said it to hurt him.", "NTA", "NTA. I feel bad for Linda because her hurt probably comes from guilt of her son turned out. You didn\u2019t turn his family against him; his family appropriately judge him for his character.", "Soft YTA.\n\nI feel like you said it just to clap back at him and even tho you're right, you've put Linda in a tricky situation. Your ex is an absolute crap but does the 5 seconds of glory of treating him like shit is worth hurting your relationship with Linda?\n\nWhat is done, Is done. You've apologized and she accepted it, but, learn from it. \n\nTake good care of yourself", "YTA,\n\nThat woman helped you and you disrespected her son so you hurt her as well probably. Your ex should have helped you imo but apparently he could not, there could be underlying reasons so I'm not gonna judge about it to harshly.\n\nEdit, he is an AH btw for not paying child support", "Esh\n\nHim for thinking depression is the reason everything went downhill and not paying child support.\n\nYou because you did this to start drama and succeeded.", "A MILD YTA. Not for hurting the guy because good riddance, but his family\u2019s opinion was not yours to voice. The whole situation must be awfully difficult for Linda, who probably wishes her son had done better than this. It was pretty inconsiderate of you to voice her feelings for her when she\u2019s not ready or not willing to do it herself.", "YTA\n\n\n\nU betrayed their trust even though they were speaking truth.

He bailed. But you telling him that throws his family and your mom under the bus even though it\u2019s true. You don\u2019t want to cause her any drama. In the future, use your own words and your own opinion and that way you can call him out without getting other people involved. But it\u2019s nice to know his family have your back. I\u2019m happy your life turned out so well!", "YTA.  I get it, but YTA - to her.  That mom is still a mom and she bonded with you over you being a good mom.  She admitted a difficult thing about her own child to you in confidence and you betrayed that which you could have easily avoided.", "Gotta give this a very, extremely soft ESH. \n\nYour ex is an AH. Fully, no question. Biggest AH in this situation by far. \n\nYou are slightly an AH for starting shit, though tbh I think it's justified. It did hurt someone you actually cared about, and had you taken a sec to consider before responding I think you would have realized that possibility - that's why it's kindof an AH move. Still, I don't blame you for it. And you didn't turn anyone against him, he clearly brought all of that on his own self.\n\nLinda sounds amazing though, I'm glad you apologized to her and tried to make it right to her. Make sure she knows how much she matters to you. <3", "You are sort of a YTA, not becouse you hurt your ex feeling (he had that coming specially since he asked that stupid question), but that you said something that was not in your place to say.\nHis mom and family might have said their honest opinions to you and they do seem to consider you family, but she is still his mom and they still seem to have a sort of relationship.\nIf she wanted to say that to him she would have, but you have kinda broken their relationship and yours as well. \nShe might not tell you her honest opinions anymore in fear you might start something unnecessary again.\n\nSometimes it is better to say nothing.\nI get why you wanted to clap back considering what he did, but it was a selfish comment to make.", "Same. I'm begging mods to add a justified AH judgement and this is a prime example of why \ud83d\ude4f", "The mods say that if you think someone is a justified asshole,  you just put NTA -  makes sense to me.", "Your judgment should be ESH if they're both TA", "Three persons in the story, the mom does not suck so imo not ESH", "Generally people rule \"ESH, except [the mom]\" rather than Y-T-A, which just means OP is the only AH. \n\nRegardless, obviously you can vote however you want, I just disagree in this case. Guy left his kid and didn't pay child support because OP had postpartum depression. Calling OP TA is too harsh imo"]}
