I had a hard time getting motivated to do anything. I was just a ball of emotions and tears.  My boyfriend was 25 at the time and he couldn't handle it.  So he left. His mom, Linda, took me in.  She took over taking care of my son and she helped me get therapy. She paid for the formula when I went on medication for my treatment and I couldn't breastfeed.  She quite literally held me while I cried, feeling useless as a mother and as a woman.  She was more of a mother to me than I had ever known before.  \n\nIt took a while but I balance out.  I got back to watching my child. When I went back to work my \"mom\" said that she would watch my son so he didn't have to go to daycare and cost me all the money I earned.  She knew her son was not paying child support.  She told me to go after him for it so I did.  Getting it made my life easier and I asked her if she wanted me to move out.  She said \"nope\". \n\nWhen my son was six, three years ago, I started talking to my now husband. He worked out at the gym where I went to get rid of all the weight I put on.  He had seen me there for years and had nodded and said hi but never approached me before.  He told me that he was really impressed by my commitment to my health and he asked me out.  I almost said no. I had only ever been with one guy and that was before the stretch marks and stuff.  \n\nLinda told me to go for it. \n\nSo, long story short, I am now married to a pretty great guy.  I'm working, and Linda  lives in our guest suite and takes care of my son before and after school.  She has even met a gentleman and has spent a few evenings out of the house.  LoL\n\nBecause of my relationship with her I am still part of her family. So several of them were invited to my wedding.  And they all called my husband an upgrade from my ex.\n\nSo last Sunday my ex was bringing my son back from his time with him and he asked if I ever thought about what our life would be if I hadn't gotten depressed. I snorted and said no. I never thought of him as anything other than a sperm donor. He said that his family had done a lot for me and that I should be grateful. I said that I was grateful TO THEM.  I said that all of them that were still in my life considered my husband an upgrade from him.  He got all butthurt that I said that and left.  \n\nHe called his mom and complained about what I said.  \n\nHer and I talked yesterday and she said that even though it was true it was hurtful and that I shouldn't have said it.  She seemed sad and I feel like shit for disappointing her.  \n\nI apologized to her and I called my ex and apologized to him. Sincerely. He called me an asshole for turning his family against him.  I guess he called other family members and they all said he wasn't as good for me as my husband. And a few were less complementary than that.  \n\nSo now I feel like crap for starting drama I could have avoided by keeping my big mouth shut.

Clearly his family does as well. And tbh, you ex is likely seeing it with his line of questioning *HOWEVER* you know what he\u2019s like so stop trying to out AH an AH.

We got a great kid out of it, so nothing to regret.\n\nAs you can see through time and patience, I worked hard to be better able to manage my mental health. What I could not have recovered from is the idea of being with a partner, the one supposed to stand by me in hard times, who would leave me in those times. And with hard work, and a loving community, I got over that too.\n\nSo, no, I do not think about what life would be like if I had not suffered through depression, because it taught me a lot of valuable lessons, and showed me the life that I truly want.
