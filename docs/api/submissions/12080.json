She spent several days at friends\u2019 homes and one of the nights sleeping on a night bus. The friends she has been hanging around with are trouble and alcohol and possibly drugs were involved. 4 nights after she ran away, myself and a friend tracked her down to a park and were able to convince her into my car (she was drunk). When we got to her mum\u2019s house she freaked out and refused to go in. Both my niece and her mum agreed that she would come to my house for the night.\n\nI live with my wife, our two sons (7/8), and my two teenagers (16F/16M). My daughter was the reason we knew she was at this park, as a friend who was there posted on social media. I also have an older daughter (22) that had been trying to talk her into going home. My niece is my wife's sister's daughter, and her dad isn't present in her life. She has a younger sister and a stepbrother.\n\nThe next day her mum came over to talk with her and that didn't go well. Afterwards my wife talked to her, and mum decided to leave and give her some space. They spent the rest of the day watching Netflix and trying to keep everything calm. The week after she ran away was half-term so none of the kids had school. That week her mum and sister came over every day to see her and they left the house with her a few times to go shopping and for dog walks. By the next week she was still living with us, and we were able to send her to school, where her mum talked to staff/councillors about what was going on.\n\nCurrently, around 5 weeks after this started, my niece still lives with us. She is having meetings with councillors and is mostly following the rules of our home. However, she has continued to get in trouble at school (despite showing some improvement at completing her homework and revising) and there has been times where she has come home from school late and lying about where she was. Her mum is fed up with this situation and wants her daughter to come home. She has turned on us and is demanding we kick her daughter out. Her daughter has only been able to stay with us up to now because her mum allowed it, now we are unsure how to proceed.\n\nMy wife and I don't feel comfortable sending her away. Over the last weeks whenever anyone has begun pushing her to go home, she starts acting out again. It also does not seem that anyone has gotten to the root of the issue of why she is acting this way. We told my SIL that we would not force her out but would continue to encourage her to go home and suggested to SIL that she continues to communicate with her daughter and persuade her home rather than forcing her. Both her and her husband are now telling us that we are meddling in their family and are threatening to call the police. My wife's parents agree that we are in the wrong and the niece\u2019s behaviour is just bratty teenage acting out.

The fact that living at home seems to be in a causal relationship with extreme behaviour is a huge red flag for possible abuse - perhaps the covert emotionally toxic kind where any given incident isn't clearly over the line but the cumulative effect is clearly harmful. It's also possible that the abuser has threatened the other kids in the home if she spills the beans and so she's stuck between telling her story and escaping and wanting to protect the other children in the home.\n\nIt's a really tough situation but worth taking a patient approach here.", "NTA for wanting to keep her when she doesn\u2019t want to go.\n\nBut\u2026 moral principles aren\u2019t the only issue here.

She should know that you care about her safety, and that sleeping rough in a public space is incredibly dangerous, which is why you are more than happy to have her stay with you. But she is old enough to understand that, unless there is a serious problem at home, you can't ignore her mom's wishes. She needs to open up - is she just sick of being at home and desperate for her independence, or is there a more serious problem at home?

I think key here is to find out WHY she does not want to go back to her mom's. Is the stepfather abusing her? Or is the atmosphere toxic? Or is she just having some teenage uncertainties? Perhaps the best thing would be to seek counseling as a family, all of you involved, and if there is no abuse and all the adults are well-meaning, they should agree to that. If the parents refuse, I'd fear something fishy.\n\nIdeally, and if the problem is just her having a difficult  puberty, both sets of adults should cooperate, and your SIL should understand that it is a kindness of you to let her daughter live with you, and under the given circumstances - otherwise she would be God knows where on the streets - a much better option for her, and both of you should work on a solution acceptable for the girl.
