I\u2019ve had enough of British weather and needed a change. I\u2019m an interpreter and I work with Spanish and my native language. I\u2019m not going to mention it because while that pairing isn\u2019t unusual in Europe, it\u2019s quite rare in South America. I don\u2019t interpret with English as it\u2019s my weakest language. \n\nAnyway, my move took a while to plan and during that time, I met my ex boyfriend. I was very upfront about my move and he was fine with that, even excited. After a few months of things going great, he suggested that he\u2019d move with me as he found a job as an English teacher.\n\nHonestly, I was apprehensive as we\u2019ve only been seeing each other for a short while but at the same time, it would be nice to not move alone.\n\nWe moved in January and rented a house together. Things were great but after two months, he was sacked from his position. He never told me the real reason, always changed his story.\n\nHe refused to learn even a bit of Spanish even though he promised he\u2019d do it. He made friends only with other Brits or people from the US. He spent his time gaming and seeing them. Chores were undone and I was doing everything, supporting him and doing chores.\nI\u2019ve had enough.\n\nBut because he wasn\u2019t working, he didn\u2019t have any money on his own. That made breaking up with him even more difficult because I would have felt horrible for kicking him out in a foreign country when he didn\u2019t even speak the language.\n\nHe started mentioning wanting to go visit his family in the UK for Christmas and asking me to buy him tickets.\nHonestly, I thought it was wonderful and it was my chance. I got him tickets and he left on December 1. \nI shipped all his stuff back to him using a courier, luckily he didn\u2019t have much. I also cancelled his return ticket.\n\nI called him up to break up with him and explain what\u2019s happened. He immediately started shouting at me which wasn\u2019t new because he would pick fights often. I blocked him everywhere. But During Christmas, I was inundated with messages and calls from his family. They\u2019d try every way possible to tell me what a horrible person I am, calling me all sorts of names, blasting me all Over social media. They\u2019re requesting I bug him his ticket so he can return. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel really bad about how I handled this. It\u2019s got me thinking thag I\u2019m the asshole here and I shouldn\u2019t have done this that way. AITA?\n\nApologies for any mistakes, my autocorrect hates me and my grammar sucks.

Beautiful way to get rid of some dead weight and a loser, moocher of a \"boyfriend.\"", "NTA. I cackled at this. His family only wants him back with you because they don\u2019t want to deal with his shenanigans either.", "NTA. If he wants to come back so much, he can pay for his own ticket, and find his own place to live.\n\nDo his dear friends know that he was living with his ~~mommy~~ girlfriend and on her dime?", "NTA\n\nHere's a detail most commenters don't seem to realize: nearly all the legitimate \"teach english in another country\" jobs require the teacher to return home if they lose the job. They also usually require that the teacher keep separate, secured funds to return to their home. Sounds like ex did neither of these things. So, sending him and his stuff home on your dime was likely a kindness to him and possibly necessary for you to protect your own safety/interests.\n\nHe probably could have been reported to the immigration authorities, arrested, and deported on their dime. That's gonna be a bad time in pretty much any country anywhere. That also risked exposing you to attention you do not want from immigration authorities.", "\u201cOur relationship hasn\u2019t been healthy since he lost his job in March and never tried to get another.

You\u2019re lucky to be in a country that didn\u2019t treat him as your tenant that you can\u2019t get ride of.\n\nThis could have escalated and gotten ugly. I\u2019m sure if he treated you with calm and respect, you could have handled it differently.", "NTA. Sure you could have given him more warning (and time to cause problems with you kicking him out). But really his family trying to get you to pay for a return ticket? Do they think you're going to let him move back in? If he's going to stay with a friend then he can work and save for the ticket to go back to said friend's house.", "NTA.

Be rid of him and ring in 2023 with a clean slate.", "NTA! Power moved, but nicely played. Well done getting rid of dead weight.", "NTA. You chose an elegant and compassionate solution to rid yourself of a lazy hobosexual. Well played", "NTA you were extremely kind to buy him a ticket home & sent his things. Anyone else would have kicked the freeloader out to fend for himself.  Tell his family to grateful he isn\u2019t stranded in South America without a job. The bank of OP is closed. He can buy his own ticket wherever her wants as long as it isn\u2019t back to you.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it like a BOSS.

So impressive", "idk it\u2019s hard to decide if YTA but i find what you did extremely funny", "NAH.

You did the right thing.", "ESH - he presumably had friends and a life in the city that didn't have to do with you, and he should have been able to decide whether to move out and stay in the city and move back, which is a choice you took away.

Now they want him gone again.", "Nta", "ESH \n\nYou where a coward in the way you acted, you could have found another appartement and broke up with him. Leaving him with a month of rent and the possibility to decide for himself what he wanted to do after that. \n\nBut the fact is that he sounded like a leach and an angry man so he may have make you feel like you had no choice. \n\nI would advice you to not let yourself be in that kind of situation ever again because, to be honest, you created part of it yourself.", "In no way are you the AH, definite NTA.

The mature thing to do was to discuss this face to face, but he sounds like he might have just refused to leave.

I don't think its bad that you broke with him, but I definitely think you could have done it in a better way. You should have just broken up with him in person and told him you'll book him a flight home if he wants to go back. Otherwise he can get out of your house and find a new place to live in this new country. But suddenly springing up \"btw we're breaking up, I'm sending your stuff, and good luck finding your way back here if you want to stay in this country,\" seems a bit rough to me. Its almost pulling the rug out from under him and getting rid of the options he should have been able to make for himself. Idk, this might be an unpopular opinion but yeah...\nDef not the asshoke for breaking up with him though, he sounds stressful af", "YTA-IF you buy him a return ticket.", "NTA. You already did your part by paying for his plane ticket and shipping his things. He was freeloading off you for a year. You should have broken up with him much sooner. Seemed like he used you and probably told a bunch of lies to his family. His family can pay for his plane ticket if he really wants to come back.", "Definitely YTA, but hilariously so. \n\nIt was just a cowards way out, and much worse than breaking up by text. \n\nYou still did him a solid sending him home to the UK, but you could definitely have handled it like a grown up.", "YTA\n\nWhile I admit what you did was hilarious, it was definitely the wrong way to go about it. You really should have talked to him about everything.", "I think YTA - only softly, because of the way the break up happened. It was very passive aggressive, when you definately should have been up front and given your ex the choice of moving out, maybe staying with a friend, finding a different job, or moving back home.\n\nIn this scenario you made the choice for them, and broke up with them after the fact which was kind of sneaky. If they had known the facts ahead of time, they could have made plans to leave or made alternate arrangements.\n\nHowever, they seemed to be a real drag, and it wasnt working, and break ups arent easy, and I agree the break up needed to happen. \n\nI wouldnt indulge his family and buy him a ticket to return home; you broke up and he hasnt paid rent etc to live with you. If he wants to come back so bad he needs to make alt arrangements and figure it tf out. At this point you need to stand your ground.", "Look the dude is an ass so definitely don't get back together and don't buy him a ticket to come back.\n\nHOWEVER, YTA. You handled this in an incredibly underhanded, petty, and immature way. You don't lie to people and then ship their stuff while refusing to communicate. You should have sat down like an adult and had a conversation or done it with a mediator if you felt unsafe since you mentioned him picking fights.", "Info: how much time is left on the lease, and is his name on it?", "YTA\n\nYou took the idea of breaking up with someone over text and then made it so much worse.\n\nAlthough after what you did, I'm wondering why he would even want to return,  you sound fantastic", "Lol you shipped him and his belongings to another country. This is so much worse than breaking up by text. \n\nYTA.\n\nEdit: don't get me wrong, I'm glad you broke up with him. And how you did it is epic.
