Based on this wording, I would also assume that dinosaur costumes would be okay. \n\nI personally feel like fairies and gothic costumes do not really fit into the theme of \"joining the moon and sea\" If those costumes are okay, then why not dinosaurs?\n\nYou mentioned \"Renaissance best\". Dragons were a huge part of stories/myths and legends at that time - what if guests dressed as those beasts? Werewolves are affected by the moon - are you going to be upset if someone dresses up in such a costume? Sharks live in the sea - are you happy to have guests dress like this? Mermaids and sirens are mythical creatures of the sea - are you going to enjoy seeing guests dress like these traditionally beautiful and enchanting creatures?

Can we collectively stop trying to control our wedding guests? If you want a specific kind of attire, you indicate that on the invite (as OP did). If OP wanted specific dresses/costumes only, she should have indicated that so people can make an informed RSVP choice. \n\n\nThis whole weird \"omg rip the attention from my cold, dead hands\" is so fucking cringey.

They're huge spectacles and it might make a fun video to wear them picking up grandma from the airport but they'll just get in the way during the ceremony and when people are eating. \n\nThey want a whimsical or period piece or wtvr type of party and look. If this was an 80s party, or murder mystery party and the invite described costume choices but put 'whatever you feel comfortable wearing!'

If OP actually cared about how tacky her ren faire wedding would look, she'd require the moon bride side in gray or silver and the sea king groom's in blue or something.", "She was very specific.  Nowhere does a Trex costume seem an appropriate choice.", "I'm leaning a little ESH myself - the costume note really should have been clearer if OP wanted a specific esthetic, but you'd think family members would maybe be considerate enough to ask before taking it that far. It just doesn't seem very thoughtful to draw that much attention to yourself, and if you want to pull off a joke or stunt at the wedding, you should really run it by the couple first and confirm that they find it as funny as you think it is. \n\nOP is really getting skewered by people trashing her wedding concept, which is, admittedly, oddly specific while keeping it eclectic. I feel like this is the source of a lot of the YTA rulings, plus a certain disdain for theme weddings I'm picking up on.

Same goes for, for example, wearing a prom dress to a wedding.", "She did say costume/cosplay, to be fair. I do agree though if Op has a certain image in mind, she needs to express that and be more thorough with instructions next time. In her defense, I don't think op would have imagined she would have to specify to adults that wearing a giant blow up T-Rex costume isn't welcome.

Where do you hire such costumes? How much are they? \n\nI must admit, given what you have chosen to wear, that you calling their choice tacky was pot calling the kettle black but that is just my personal opinion and, perhaps, irrelevant.\n\nPersonally, having received such an invitation, I would wish you the very best for the future and stay at home.\n\nYou are clearly N T A for wanting to wear such costumes at your own wedding but YTA for making your guests wear things to match.

Just because you and your husband, as cosplayers, have a very specific definition of \u201ccostume/garb\u201d, does not mean that everyone you invited to your wedding defines those terms the same way. To non-cosplayers, a dinosaur costume IS a costume. I doubt they did this to be mean spirited, but thought this would be the most fun wedding they have ever been to and wanted to have fun with your theme and also honor your husband\u2019s love for a Jurassic Park, and part of your love story! I think it\u2019s both funny and sweet really. You should be prepared that even if they leave the dino gear behind, other normies may show up in random costumes that also don\u2019t fit your theme. \n\nMight I suggest setting up a wedding website where you can give examples of what to wear and where to buy appropriate costumes for guests who might be interested. I\u2019d hate for great Aunt Edna to show up in a  biker chick costume and not be allowed inside because she didn\u2019t fit the vibe. \n\nHonestly, my advice would be to just go with the flow.

That makes perfect sense.", "Well done.", "excellent!  \nalso, old school Poseidon or modern style Aquaman?", " One of the directions were nothing \"political\" or \"religious\" and not knowing the brides family (I was a guest of the groom) too well I made sure to check if  the jeweled glittered dinosaur fascinator I made would be considered offensive to some as my dad was one of those weirdos who believed that dinosaurs weren't real. Be specific and have examples if you don't want any surprises", "But did she make that explicit in the invites? Because it seems she just said \u201cwear a costume/cosplay outfit\u201d.", "I understand if that was the theme, but she did not specifically say in her post that she shared the moon goddess theme in the invitation. She may have, but she didn\u2019t say it in the post. So that\u2019s what I was going by.", "I'd dress up as Princess Yue and now I need someone I know to have this themed wedding so I can do so", ">Personally I do think that if you don't want to run the risk of people showing up in inappropriate garb, then be specific in your instructions.\n\nEven if you are specific in your instructions some people will ignore them, which was the main point of my comment.  \n\nIf I, or any other reasonable person, has a question about the appropriate attire for an event I will *ask* the host.  I won't make an assumption and the same goes for almost everyone else.\n\n\"The theme is moon goddess and sea god, I'll go as a dinosaur!\"  \n\nSee how ridiculous that sounds.", "I\u2019m giving the benefit of the doubt that OP said what the theme was because she opened up for guests to wear a costume/dress in that theme because why would someone knowingly have a theme but not mention the theme? Seems counterintuitive. \n\nI can understand messing up and not say don\u2019t wear a dumb costume like a T-Rex costume or a Shark costume (though a shark costume fits the theme and I would of argued a Y T A if it was with the theme.)\n\nHowever, at the end of the day both the fianc\u00e9 and OP asked the Uncle to not wear it but they bought the costumes anyways. I don\u2019t see how OP is an AH here.", "I mean, if you are going to have a theme you would tell that to your guests. Unless OP didn\u2019t say the specific theme then yeah, but I\u2019m going off common sense that OP would of done it."]}
