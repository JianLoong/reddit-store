However, the past few years have been a bit more tense, and seemed to have started since he began dating his now fianc\u00e9. It\u2019s always felt like she\u2019s had a chip on her shoulder towards me and my fianc\u00e9. I\u2019ve never been a fan of her because of her selfish and entitled outlook on life (a long with many more reasons), but I\u2019m nothing but friendly to her and my brother when we meet at my parents\u2019 house. \n\nHe proposed to her about a year ago after they dated for about 2 years, and I proposed to my fianc\u00e9 6 months later after we dated for about 6 years. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother had passed away suddenly earlier that year, and as much as I\u2019d loved her to see us engaged, I knew our engagement would cheer up my fianc\u00e9 and her family a bit. My brother had asked if we had a time frame on when we were getting married, but we hadn\u2019t planned anything yet. My brother then informs everyone that they plan on throwing a grand destination wedding 2 years following his engagement. \n\nAbout a year after our engagement, my fianc\u00e9 and I decided that we wanted to avoid the financial burden and inevitable drama of a wedding, so we\u2019d elope and celebrate individually with family and friends. We decided we\u2019d elope on our anniversary the following year, about 5 months before my brother\u2019s wedding. Since we were going to elope we didn\u2019t think it would conflict with my brother\u2019s wedding plans (we apparently thought wrong).\n\nWhen my brother found out about our plan he was furious. He told me that they put a lot of time and money into planning their wedding, and they deserve to have their \u201cown year\u201d. I expressed that we could wait to tell people we\u2019ve eloped until after his wedding if it was an issue, but he was insistent about us not getting married in the same year # as him. This was unlike my brother and it sounded like he was regurgitating the delusion of his partner. My parents initially sided with him, but eased off of me once I explained that if the roles were reversed I\u2019d love to be married the same year as my brother. \n\nMy brother recently told me he wasn\u2019t going to have me in his wedding party, and can\u2019t continue our relationship if we eloped the same year as his wedding, but we don\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to celebrate our marriage with our grandparents before they become too sick.\n\nAITA if we follow through with our elopement the same year as his wedding?", "created_utc": 1701145191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185ndt9/aita_for_getting_eloped_the_same_year_as_my/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should probably cancel those as well....", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry he's drawn this bizarrely arbitrary line in the sand. Plenty of people get married every year, and each one is special.

There's room here for  both of you to have the weddings you want. It doesn't have to be a competition. He's created that. \n\n\nDo not change your plans. Drop out of his wedding before he can remove you, and explain why.

That isn't a reasonable expectation and we will be getting married on our anniversary.  As much as I hate to do it, I am removing myself from your wedding party so that you do not have to remove me. I'd like to save you from having to do that. I love you and hope you and your new wife have decades of happiness together. \"*", "NTA.. you do whatever makes your love story the best for you.

No one gets a wedding year.

If you were doing it 2 weeks beforehand it might be kinda rude but you are ELOPING. There is nothing to interrupt. No one is entitled to a year where no one else gets married.", "NTA \n\ngo for it have the wedding you want, it's not like you are upstaging your brother, in fact it's the opposite.\n\nCongratulations and good luck", "Own year? \ud83e\udd23 Wow. \ud83e\udd23", " NTA.
