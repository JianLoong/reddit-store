He\u2019s a huge groomzilla. Nobody owns a year to get married in. That\u2019s straight up absurd. It\u2019s maybe reasonable to expect family not to set a date the same month just for logistics because it can be hard on family to have to arrange time off twice in a month. I would decline to be in his wedding party and maybe don\u2019t attend. You do you and ignore all his drama", "NTA my best friend is getting married the weekend after mine. We are both over joyed.

Some people get really weird about time frames, I read a post where the bride demanded no one get engaged or married in the planning lead up and year after the wedding\u2026.. wtaf! \ud83d\ude31\n\nETA\u2026.. if they\u2019re carrying on like this now I\u2019d be quite happy about the get out of jail card for being in the  wedding party!", "My husband\u2019s sister and her fianc\u00e9 planned a December wedding (this was many years ago).  Then their brother and fianc\u00e9e up and decided to get married in June, 6 months before his sister (no reason, they just wanted to).  Ok we all rolled with it.  Then another sister became pregnant and she and her fianc\u00e9 got married in October.  So three family weddings in the space of six months, with at least half of the same guests at each.  We just rolled with it   The December bride, the first with a planned wedding but the last to get married, just kinda said Meh, what are you gonna do?   The only ones who minded were my MIL and FIL, they shelled out a lot of money that year!\n\nMy point is, each wedding was special, and as far as I know no one complained about 3 weddings being so close to one another \nPS-only December bride and her husband are still married", "lol WTH \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f a wedding year lol  NTA\nHave a talk with your brother just the 3 of you", "i\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t claim an ENTIRE YEAR wtf?????\n\nNTA", "Anyone who got married in 2021 stole my wedding year and should be ashamed. /s \n\nNta", "The less celebrated groomzilla strikes.\n\nYou're NTA.

How ridiculous. 5 months is more than reasonable. Carry on with your plans, elope, enjoy celebrating with those who choose to celebrate with you. \n\nUnfortunately it sounds like your brother will continue to be unreasonable on all things as long as he is with a partner who encourages this behaviour. This is something you will have to accept (difficult as it is). \n\nLive your life. Do things that bring you joy and surround yourself with others with the same mindset.", "NTA.  Your brother has no exclusive hold on a year just because he is getting married.  His behaviour is childish and entitled.  Elope and get married so you are happy.  I bet he would have a hard time explaining why you are not at his wedding by using his sad excuse.", "NTA! \n\nBut tell your brother (almost certainly actually his fianc\u00e9 but the words are coming from HIS mouth) that any compromises you were willing to make are now gone. He does not get to claim an entire year - I could see his point if it was a month or maybe even two, and another big ceremony, but it isn\u2019t!

There is no such thing as a wedding year.  \n\nOn top of that, you are eloping.

What about birthdays, is anyone allowed to celebrate that year? What if a baby is born?!?", "NTA. If your wedding was closer to his, *and* you were also having a big wedding *and* people would have to travel for both weddings, then it would be more understandable because two big weddings close together is a lot, and guests would feel forced to choose.\n\nThat's not what this is, though.

She was also offended that we were momentarily considering doing Nightmare before Christmas as our theme, she claimed that had been her theme even though there wasn't any visible theme for their wedding. When I brought it up to her wife, her wife told me that their theme was actually supposed to be Corpse Bride. So she was so crazy that she didn't think anyone could have an October weddinging, and they couldn't have a similar but not same wedding theme. \nThis woman also thinks she should be celebrated the whole month of her birthday.", "I like how rational you are, but I'd have loved your last sentence to read \"... hope you and your new wife have days of happiness together.\" Seriously, marrying someone who thinks they need a wedding *year* does not bode well for their mental state. \n\n\nCould you imagine if OP and his wife attended this wedding and she was *gasp* PREGANANANT?!", "My dh's best friend got married three *weeks* before we did.
