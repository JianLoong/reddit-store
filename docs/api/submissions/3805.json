A little back story. My mom had me at 14 and didn't know who my father was. She was partying, sleeping around and using illegal substances. My grandma took care of me because my mom never intended to be a mom. When i was 2 my mom got pregnant again and the guy she was seeing wanted nothing to do with the baby. Grandma had told my mom that she since she doesn't care about school (she was failed most of her classes) then she either starts taking care of her kids or gets a job . My mom promised she'll do better at school so grandma agreed to keep raising us only if my mom won't have any more kids. \n\nWhen i was 15 she got pregnant again and grandma kicked her out but let me and my brother stay. We never heard from her again.\n\nI studied very hard and got into college with a full scholarship wich got me good room in the dorms. I had about 12k saved wich i used for food and extras. After the first semester thanks to my grades i got a paid (about 5k) internship at my dream job. Since i graduated my paycheck doubled and after 4 months i got a promotion that added another 6k to my paycheck. \n\nMy mom is suddenly back. She found my Instagram and saw that i travel frequently and that i own a 45k car. Last weekend i went home and mom was there with 4 kids. Apparently she got married and had 3 more kids in the last 4 years.\n\n To cut the story short my mom wants me to start college funds for the other 4 kids because there my siblings and it's not fair that I'm helping my brother with his college expensise but not them. \n\nI got really angry i told her that she's not my mom and they're not my siblings and that she's an idiot if she thinks i will give her a dollar after 7 years of radio silence.\n\nGrandma and my brother are on my side but some friends say I'm not fair because she is still my mom even if she's a bad mom and that my siblings are my siblings even tho I've never met them. So AITA?\n\nLittle UPDATE:\nShe DMed me on IG to again say I'm not fair etc. I told her that I'm open to try and build a relationship with my half siblings because at the end of the day it's not their fault she's a horrible mother and they deserve to at least get to know me and my brother however, i will never ever want a relationship with her. I told i can be cordial towards her but she isn't my mom, never was and never will be. Also, my brother feels the same. Her response was \"so that means you will pay their college?\" I again said no. I'm only open to getting to know them and MAYBE having a relationship with them over the YEARS but they will never stand at the same level as my brother. She said if we (brother and me) want to build a relationship with them she will only let us see them if i agree to pay.", "created_utc": 1670028746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb3ax4/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_not_my_mom_and_her/", "score": 288, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So it's one of them", "Omg she said her mother was sleeping around and doing drugs; she had 6 kids by multiple fathers; what\u2019s \u201cshocking\u201d is her mother\u2019s behavior, not the way she talked about her.", "Car! Idk what happened there sorry", "She wanted to have fun- her words", "Thank you!!\u2665\ufe0f", "A month", "Your mother's using some pretty twisted logic:  what's fair is if she actually supported her children (for once), instead of blowing through her money and expecting others to help out.\n\nTrust me, you did the right thing.", "The friends who say you are an AH have never experienced what you have experienced and clearly not empathic enough to understand what you and your brother went through.\n\nNTA. Get better friends.", "She's trying to \" guilt\" you into thinking you owe her and those other kids something. Honestly, you don't.", "Repeat you said no. And get a restraining order if necessary. You are neither obligated nor should be manipulated by her.", "What's unfair is that she never tried to raise you and showed up to ask you for anything. Who are these people who think you owe her anything? They're not your friends. They're not your support system.", "Not fair? NOT FAIR?!? \n\nWhat\u2019s not fair is you and your brother being abandoned. Nothing about your life was fair so why she thinks that\u2019s justification for anything is a mystery. \n\nMake your Insta private and move on with your life. NTA.", "Life isn\u2019t fair \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Gaslighting momma", "I'm so sorry OP. You sound like you got a lovely mom in your grandmother when your birthgiver couldn't/wouldn't be one. You're certainly NTA and should never feel obligated to financially help anyone outside or your safe circle. \n\nI just want to say that I'm going to be secretly willing my kids to be like you when they grow up because you are intelligent, strong, successful, and the kind of overall amazing that anyone would be so proud to call their kid. Good luck!", "NTA. She didn't financially support you, she didn't raise you and your brother. She is now trying to hand off responsibilities towards her kids once again, this time to you instead if your grandmother. Don't do it.", "Another indication that all she wants is money. Don't bother trying to talk to her, she will just continue to ask for money.", "I legitimately just can't comprehend the fact that she couldn't even be bothered to try to pretend to want back into your life for selfless reasons. She just...Went straight for the kill, and actually thought that would work for her? Just....Wow.", "You earned the life you have and the ability to have nice things. Tell her that she should help her other kids focus on school and get good grades so they can have good lives.", "Use that money and do something nice for your grandma.", "Yikes. Maybe I'm missing something, but you have $10k left in savings and a $45k car? Please get some financial advice as car's really are a pretty terrible investment. Anyway, none of my business but you seem young and so just wanted to pass that along.  NTA at all for your question. Even if you were a millionaire it would be unreasonable to pay for like 4 kids to go to college.", "Thank you and yes i do thank my grandma all the time because she's the one that took care of me , loved me and supported me my entire life. I love her more then words can describe", "So that just proves in the 20 years since she had you she\u2019s learnt ABSOLUTELY nothing and will continue to expect everyone else to solve her messes\u2026..Nope not your responsibility!", "That\u2019s awesome! Maybe your mother will see this and get clued in that people tend to be happy to help people who have been good to them and not out of obligation and will try harder this time around, but lets be honest probably not", "Makes a lot more sense.  Thanks.  NTA.", "How many kids you got at 14?", "That\u2019s not gaslighting, that\u2019s guilting", "Omg thank you!\u2665\ufe0f", "Already did. I payed her mortgage and took her on 7 trips so far. She wants to see the world so that's what imma do", "The car is payed for completely. And in savings i have about 100k and I'm thinking of using it for a house. But i will speak with someone just to make sure if something happens my so called mother won't get her hands on anything.", "I don't have kids tf?", "No thank you! You stay strong and keep moving forward and have a fabulous life. Always remember you have an internet cheerleader cheering you on in life\ud83d\ude04!", "You are an awesome granddaughter and sister to the only sibling that you need to be awesome to. And you seem to be awesome to yourself too. A testament to your hard work and your grandma\u2019s support. Keep doing you and go back to no contact with your mom.", "You are a certified bad ass. If you do manage to buy a house, for the love of GOD do everything in your power to never let your (not) mom find out where you live. I'd lock down my socials HARD. The last thing you need is her suddenly dropping her new litter off on your doorstep."]}
