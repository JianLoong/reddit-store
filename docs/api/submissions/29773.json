{"id": 29773, "submission_id": "17hpvev", "title": "AITA making my daughter walk to the bus stop?", "selftext": "We live in upper US area where it gets cold and snow can start to come around this time. We are used to harsh winters (close to 0 if not negative in the winter months is usual). This morning we woke to a tiny layer of snow (which will melt when the sun comes up) and temperatures hovering around freezing (32F). Again, not anything crazy out of the ordinary, we've lived here our entire lives so we're used to it. \n\nOur 10 year olds bus stop system switched last year so instead of stopping at every house, they now have 1 designated spot for pick up for the neighborhood. It's about a 3 minute walk from our home. No roads to cross, she can walk the bike path around the pond.\n\nMy husband works as a part time snow plow driver, so he has to leave early on snow days (3am today instead of his usual 8). He normally drives her to the spot on his way to work a couple minutes before the bus gets there. \n\nI'm a SAHM. We also have a 1 and 4 year old. The 1 year old is normally still asleep during the morning routine, and sleeps for at least an hour afterward. I use that time to get quite a bit of the daily things around the house that need doing done without a baby attached. \n\nThis morning she threw a fit about everything. How cold it was. She didn't want to wear her winter coat. She didn't want to walk. She wanted me to either wake the baby up to put in the car for a 5 minute round trip to drop her off. Or leave him sleeping in the house alone. Neither of those were good options to me. She's 10, she's able to stand outside. Some other kids have an even further walk than she does, and they do it every day. She left in a huff pretty early to the bus getting there refusing to wear gloves or snow pants (but conceded with a sweater, light winter coat, and hat). \n\nI didn't think I was the AH until I talked to husband later and he said I could've done option 1 and it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. I think I shouldn't have to wake the baby up and disrupt his day. On the super negative or windy days, I will drive her if husband is gone. I thought we'd have a couple more months until then, and 1 year old will be in a different sleep stage, hopefully weened off night bottles by then.\n\nETA: \n\u2022She gets plenty of attention and isn't neglected. She's the only one in sports, which we both attend and cheer her on. We regularly have 1 on 1 mom/daughter or dad dates with her. She alone always joins me on errands if she wants so we can wander target or get Starbucks and drive around just the two of us.\n\n\u2022She knows she has to walk if dad is gone and it's not crazy cold or rainy conditions. He drops her off as it's the path he takes every day anyway on the way to work. She did it last year. It's just a nice thing he does for her and not in any way an inconvenience to him.\n\n\u2022The 4 year old is special needs so a disability van comes to the house for pick up 15 minutes before she has to leave. She likes to help with that so she knew the weather. She loves being an older sibling. \n\n\u2022Tantrums aren't usual but also not out of the ordinary lately. We used to say from age 8 she was 8 going on 18. I raised a strong, willful girl who knows her own mind and isn't afraid to speak it (with a preteen attitude angle).\n", "created_utc": 1698419846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hpvev/aita_making_my_daughter_walk_to_the_bus_stop/", "score": 382, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is just what we do, so there are no arguments.\n\nShe shouldn't need snowpants to walk 3 min to the bus.  Though will need them in her backpack for recess.

When getting my own kid used to something they don't like (whether that was drop off at a new school or giving him new chores) I always remind myself, this is a long term investment in them being a functional grown up able to take care of themself. Yeah, you get pushback and sass and stuff, but you get through it and eventually it's no big deal. My mental image is if you had a dollar and put it in a savings account, and in 18 years you have a nice chunk of change.

She will learn to pick her battles, and either wear a jacket or freeze.

The four year old has special needs so gets special treatment (obviously necessary and understandable, but try to see it through the eyes of a child) and then you have the baby who gets to just sleep in and stay warm and cozy haha. \n\nSo maybe you can create a plan that's a little more flexible that shows her when she really needs it, you'll drive her.

I don't have kids myself but I do know how much of a hassle it is getting them up and in the carrier and in the car. And it's all pointless for a 5 minute round trip. I'm not calling your daughter entitled by any means, but she needs to understand that you can't uproot your whole morning and your 1 year olds whole morning because she doesn't want to walk 3 minutes in weather she grew up with.", "She'll be fine. It's a small discomfort. I definitely had to walk in worse because my mom didn't drive. I'm glad she's got a parent that can drive her when it's terrible tho. \n\nI slipped 3 times one day trying to walk to school after they finally started having us back after a huge ice storm. I barely made it a block so I just went home. Told my mom I wasn't going lol.", "NTA and in this day and age, if someone were to find out you left your baby alone, even for 5 minutes, they will report you to CPS or your states equivalent. Americans are nosey, busy body pain in the asses who think they can tell you how to raise your kids.", "Nya. I live in Canada and at age 10 stopped taking the school bus. I would either walk home form school in nice weather (35 min) or do a 5 min walk and take the subway in bad weather. So yeah not a big deal.", "NTA. Most likely she just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. If anything, make sure she isn\u2019t coming down with something but honestly, she\u2019s fine.", "NTA. We walked 15 minute rain or shine to elementary school from my second grade year till we moved onto middle school. Also upper US. We bundled up \ud83e\udd37", "You and hubs should get on the same page and then have a sit down with daughter. Tell her that this is not acceptable. You should not have to wake up the baby or leave the baby at home alone. A very short walk is good for her. Make sure she has warm clothes and maybe a couple of options for outer weather. It's barely the start of the cold season so you have several months to go of cold, ugly weather before next spring arrives. Good luck.\n\nNTA", "Sounds like she was just having a day. We\u2019ve all been there. Hopefully tomorrow is a better day, the weekend she can have a sleep in.", "NTA\n\nIt's my time to shine!  I lived in a special place.  On a hill.  My school existed in a special place too.  On a hill.  These two places existed in a special place.  One where we got 2 to 3 feet of snow each year.  My school and home were separated by around 4 or 5 miles.  \n\nWhat does this mean?  It means I literally walked 5 miles, uphill both ways, in the winter, through the snow to get to and from school.  \n\nA 3 minute walk will be ok for your daughter.", "NTA. My dad would my siblings and I to school. When my brother and I were in middle school the school would be locked until seven but we were dropped off around six. No shelter and very bitter wet winters. My brother and I eventually found a way around it by joining an art club that allowed us in early.", "100000% the AH it takes like you said 5 minutes to do a round trip to the bus stop and it takes how long to get the baby ready? not long is my point you could've just taken her to the bus stop i dont think you realize she is 10. not 18. shes not grown shes still a child do you know how many children are picked up and kidnapped by strangers at bus stops? Alot. im not sure about you but id want my child to be safe rather then be sorry about it later on.", "Is it possible she got her period?\n\nEven if not, it sounds like she was having a really bad day. \n\nI think you should talk to her over the weekend & figure out what was going on for her, since this isn\u2019t unusual for her to need to walk in this type of weather. \n\nFocus on her on & what was going on for her. If the conversation reveals something that might make the routine need to change, don\u2019t make any promises & just keep the focus on her & her feelings. You & your husband can talk later about what all the options are.", "Uh that sounds a bit unusual for 10. My 10s were more on the - \u201cbabies get their moms to walk them to the bus, mom!\u201d side of things.\n\nNot wanting to wear a coat is definitely par for the course but in my house a child who felt it was warm enough to not wear a coat could not simultaneously claim that it was too cold to walk. Pick a lane. But waking the baby would be non negotiable for me.\n\nNTA but something about the way you casually talk about tantrums and fits and the \u201cstrong, willful girl\u201d makes me think perhaps stronger boundaries could be helpful for your kid. 8 going on 18 - not sure what that even means, but I feel like you might be unintentionally equating what sounds like immature and somewhat bratty behaviour with being a teenager. A teen can be strong, confident, know their own mind and not afraid to speak it but also respectful and willing to think of what\u2019s best for others over their own desires. Are you sure your kid is on track to be that kind of teen?", "Canadian here, I walked the 15 minutes to school from jk-8, even in the -40 weather. She sounds like a typical 10-year-old. Heck, I'm 47, and I still have mornings like this. I don't want to wear a coat or walk to the bus in the rain/fog/snow. Sadly, this is just life in the northern areas.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I make my kids walk to the bus stop\u2014about 2 minutes away\u2014on cold mornings too. She\u2019ll live.", "NTA", "NTA I wish I had  had a 3 minute walk when I was that age. 70s kid two miles no matter the weather. There's no reason to make the little ones get up.", "Is the special needs child autistic? If so don\u2019t be surprised if the 8 year old is as well. Tantrums or meltdowns? Change of routine and having to do extra functioning. Something to consider.", "NTA- Can you compromise and stand in the driveway/doorway until the bus gets her? She\u2019s capable of walking to the bus stop in inclement weather. What she needs from you is proof she matters just as much as a sleeping one year old and her special needs sibling. I know you said you have mommy/daughter days but do you? Grocery shopping isn\u2019t the same as one on one attention.", "this is normal in suburban chicago. plenty of snow and subzero temps. everyone i know walked to school.", "NTA.\nWe have a 3 year old that rides with us on public transit to daycare every day. It's a 5 minute walk from our house. She can definitely do it, I cannot fathom why a 10 year old can't.", "When I was in kindergarten and first second and third grade, age age 4, 5, 6, in the snowy winter northeast, I had to walk over a mile home from school. I remember the morning drive TO school, the parents had some kind of carpooling deal, but not for pick up from school. We all walked home. This was when girls had to always wear a skirt to school back then too. We had these crappy thin nylon leggings called leotards which were slightly helpful, but most of the time it was knee socks with bare skin from the knee up to the top of the leg. Walking home over a mile in the freezing winter cold or snow covered day, practically still a toddler. It wasn\u2019t until middle school we started to be able to wear pants to school.   \nYour daughter can walk herself up to the bus stop.   \nNTA", "NTA but honestly it sounds like your daughter wants you to prioritize her for a little bit. Maybe have a talk with her and do something special just the two of you, without the babies?", "Oh, the humanity!\n\nNTA", "NTA I had to walk 5 minutes to the bus stop no matter how cold or wet.  Up the hill and halfway down the other side. Started that at 9. She\u2019s spoiled. My Mom never drive any of us kids to the bus stop. Dress appropriately.", "I live where our winters get to -40 and rarely zero and our kids walk to school unless it is -40", "NAH\n \nYou\u2019re definitely NTA here. She was never in any danger and a little discomfort is okay. Waking the baby that much early would have thrown off your entire day. I remind my kids often that they\u2019re not always going to like the things they have to do but they still need to be done. \n\nAnd she\u2019s NTA because she\u2019s 10 and I don\u2019t blame her from grumbling on a cold morning when she\u2019d prefer someone save her from the discomfort.", "I grew up on a farm and had a gravel driveway longer than her walk. We had to walk to the bus even in terrible weather. Uphill both ways. Jk on that last partn but my parents never even drove me to the end even in rain or snow. I'm feeling neglected and need to call my mom lol. NTA", "INFO: it's a three minute walk but how long is she outside waiting for the bus?,", "NTA I live in southern Ontario, so have very similar weather. It's super normal for kids to walk to their bus stop even in shitty weather. Honestly her getting a ride most mornings sounds like a luxury to me. \n\nThough trying to get her to wear snow pants in a light dusting of snow sounds like overkill!", "NTA - assuming that it would be easy enough for her to contact you if the bus was late. 1st snowfalls of the year always create traffic issues while everyone digs through their memory of how to drive in icy conditions.\n\n1st snowfalls in general can be tough on a lot of people, we had ours on Monday. I had Halloween stuff planned with some kids who normally are ok with walking on Tuesday. It was -5, minimal wind, so fairly warm when the snow isn't immediately melting. We ditched the walking aspect as the kids were really against it. I'll give her justified AH for snow in Oct. It's expected in places like here, but it can make anyone a bit cranky and not eager to be outdoors until we adjust.", "\n\nP\u00e5", "NTA\n\nI walked 8 blocks in a foot of snow daily from age 7 to 14.", "It sounds like her walking is the most feasible option. But that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t suck. Maybe offer her some sympathy and drive her on the very snowy days! Sometimes a hard snow means that the busses are late and she could be very cold for several minutes.", "Is your daughter having difficulty removing/putting her winter wear back on?  Are the zippers or boots if they tie an issue?  Does she have a locker at school she is having issues with as far as opening it?  Does she feel like she is rushed on arrival or at dismissal with putting away or putting the winter clothing back on?  I\u2019m just trying to view her behavior from a different angle.", "I\u2019m sorry but I feel 10 is too young to go down the street unaccompanied but that\u2019s my opinion.", "NAH you're absolutely right but she's a kid, she has to try", "NTA, I did it as a child. It\u2019s not that bad. Yeah of course I hated it and didn\u2019t want to do it but not everything is avoidable/convenient. As long as she\u2019s not going to hurt herself falling on ice or any other way like not wearing the proper clothes then she should be okay!", "Yeah I grew up in Maine and CT. Had to walk even further. My only complaint living in Maine was the whole having to be outside at 630 in the morning. Walking wasn't the problem. The cold kind of sucked, but it is what it is. I would just bundle up I don't care if I look ridiculous. When it's that cold, the people who wanted to look cool and not wear enough layers were idiots. . What I didn't get was the kids (pretty much only boys) who would be outside in shorts when it was below freezing, that wasn't about being cool it was just weird.", "Me and my sister both walked to school at that age. We live roughly a half-mile from the school and could walk that distance in about 10 minutes. It sounds like she's only walking a little ways away if she's doing it in 3.\n\nNTA. She'll survive, she just needs a warmer coat.", "I went to a walking students only school from p-9 I  Canada, my walk took around 10-12 minutes.", "Common German saying and there's a ton in Michigan, so that checks out", " It\u2019s not unusual behavior for a 10 year old to be tired of having to walk then stand till the bus comes in really cold weather.", "This! She sounds like a really good kid who had a bad morning! Second the idea of thinking through some cozy ideas with her that you can send her on her walk when it\u2019s cold &  she can\u2019t be driven, like hot chocolate.", "My dad would do the same exact thing\u2026 even if it was raining or snowing \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "\"genuinely one of the most liberating times of my childhood\"\n\nIt seems that a lot of people these days don't understand this.

I feel so sorry for kids that experience so little freedom before their teenage years.", "I lived in NH briefly for my job. There were 8' poles around the parking lot and the roads. This was in June. I asked about them. I was told they were there so the snow plows could find the surface of the road. I am forever grateful that I didn't experience a harsh winter while there. There is an idiom that says all's fair in love and war. I've added cold weather to that. Warmth over fashion.", "Is that Celsius or fahrenheit?", "I'm guessing LW is in the Twin Cities -- they got a dusting of sniw this morning. (Snow pants not required.)", "My husband works in an industry where you can't have passengers in your vehicle. He'd lose his special licenses.", "I agree tbh, i want to move back somewhere where the public transport was just as good. I hate using my car tbh, and the US has horrendous public transportation. I like listening to music and sitting in a bus for the time to pass. People in the states think it's endangerment to make kids walk to school or use public transport, but it's really a good skill to have. you might not have a car for some period of your life, maybe it's not financially feasible. public transportation is so important and it does a lot of independent freedom for younger kids", "Or, as I often say with my kids, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re getting sick. Maybe they\u2019re hitting a growth spurt. Maybe Mercury is in retrograde.\u201d\n\nSometimes kids just get difficult for no apparent reason. I think it\u2019s often related to brain development, but you rarely know for sure. You just try to make sure they get to bed a little early that night and otherwise hold steady.

Why???", "A one year old is not capable of understanding that choosing not to wear a coat will make them cold. A ten year old is.", "...but do you think no one in a cold area of the world has a job?
