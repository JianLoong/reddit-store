{"id": 29773, "submission_id": "17hpvev", "title": "AITA making my daughter walk to the bus stop?", "selftext": "We live in upper US area where it gets cold and snow can start to come around this time. We are used to harsh winters (close to 0 if not negative in the winter months is usual). This morning we woke to a tiny layer of snow (which will melt when the sun comes up) and temperatures hovering around freezing (32F). Again, not anything crazy out of the ordinary, we've lived here our entire lives so we're used to it. \n\nOur 10 year olds bus stop system switched last year so instead of stopping at every house, they now have 1 designated spot for pick up for the neighborhood. It's about a 3 minute walk from our home. No roads to cross, she can walk the bike path around the pond.\n\nMy husband works as a part time snow plow driver, so he has to leave early on snow days (3am today instead of his usual 8). He normally drives her to the spot on his way to work a couple minutes before the bus gets there. \n\nI'm a SAHM. We also have a 1 and 4 year old. The 1 year old is normally still asleep during the morning routine, and sleeps for at least an hour afterward. I use that time to get quite a bit of the daily things around the house that need doing done without a baby attached. \n\nThis morning she threw a fit about everything. How cold it was. She didn't want to wear her winter coat. She didn't want to walk. She wanted me to either wake the baby up to put in the car for a 5 minute round trip to drop her off. Or leave him sleeping in the house alone. Neither of those were good options to me. She's 10, she's able to stand outside. Some other kids have an even further walk than she does, and they do it every day. She left in a huff pretty early to the bus getting there refusing to wear gloves or snow pants (but conceded with a sweater, light winter coat, and hat). \n\nI didn't think I was the AH until I talked to husband later and he said I could've done option 1 and it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. I think I shouldn't have to wake the baby up and disrupt his day. On the super negative or windy days, I will drive her if husband is gone. I thought we'd have a couple more months until then, and 1 year old will be in a different sleep stage, hopefully weened off night bottles by then.\n\nETA: \n\u2022She gets plenty of attention and isn't neglected. She's the only one in sports, which we both attend and cheer her on. We regularly have 1 on 1 mom/daughter or dad dates with her. She alone always joins me on errands if she wants so we can wander target or get Starbucks and drive around just the two of us.\n\n\u2022She knows she has to walk if dad is gone and it's not crazy cold or rainy conditions. He drops her off as it's the path he takes every day anyway on the way to work. She did it last year. It's just a nice thing he does for her and not in any way an inconvenience to him.\n\n\u2022The 4 year old is special needs so a disability van comes to the house for pick up 15 minutes before she has to leave. She likes to help with that so she knew the weather. She loves being an older sibling. \n\n\u2022Tantrums aren't usual but also not out of the ordinary lately. We used to say from age 8 she was 8 going on 18. I raised a strong, willful girl who knows her own mind and isn't afraid to speak it (with a preteen attitude angle).\n", "created_utc": 1698419846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hpvev/aita_making_my_daughter_walk_to_the_bus_stop/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is just what we do, so there are no arguments.\n\nShe shouldn't need snowpants to walk 3 min to the bus.  Though will need them in her backpack for recess.

I'd guess she's testing your boundaries, so I'd say just grin and bear it until it becomes routine. When getting my own kid used to something they don't like (whether that was drop off at a new school or giving him new chores) I always remind myself, this is a long term investment in them being a functional grown up able to take care of themself. Yeah, you get pushback and sass and stuff, but you get through it and eventually it's no big deal. My mental image is if you had a dollar and put it in a savings account, and in 18 years you have a nice chunk of change.

She will learn to pick her battles, and either wear a jacket or freeze.

The four year old has special needs so gets special treatment (obviously necessary and understandable, but try to see it through the eyes of a child) and then you have the baby who gets to just sleep in and stay warm and cozy haha. \n\nSo maybe you can create a plan that's a little more flexible that shows her when she really needs it, you'll drive her.

Yes, she didn't cope well with the choice, but you couldn't have foreseen that outcome. \n\nYour husband is right that, yes, technically you could have gone with option 1. But who knows that the impact of that choice would have been? It might have resulted in a cranky baby and a husband telling you that you should have done something different, right?\n\nHindsight, they say, is 20-20.\n\nI'm confident she'll get used to walking alone again.  If she doesn't then maybe you'll find another solution.  In my day, kids used to walk to school or the bus stop together.  Maybe she'll find some friends to walk with, too.  Hang in there, Mom!  Parenting is never boring, is it?", "NAH we get sub zero wind temps and use to walk to the bus stop or to school depending on where we lived. It was usually .5 mile-1 mile. Weather didn't matter, you dressed for it and that was that. \n\nI don't think this has anything to do with the weather. Throwing tantrums isn't normal at her age. Something else is going on and you need to sit her down and have a heart to heart, see if you can get to the bottom of it. Maybe she doesn't feel like she's getting enough attention with the 2 littles or their needs always come before hers. Whatever it is, it's best to figure it out before that issue gets worse.", "NAH.\n\nBut it's odd that you, and many commenters, are ignoring the obvious question: how reliable is the bus?

There's no need to coddle or baby her,  she's going to have to learn to do things on her own.", "NTA, she can absolutely walk, but just wondering, is something bothering her? Does she hate how her coat looks? Have her mittens or scarf been made fun of? Winter boots? I mean, don't cave, but please listen if something is up that's going to make her and your life harder the coming months.", "I say NTA I was a little bit on the fence about until I learned it was just a three minute walk when I was a kid my bus would not go down my driveway which made sense it was 3/4 of a mile and a dirt road through a wooded area so my dad would always drive me in the mornings but at that age she can pick herself up enough to walk three minutes in cold weather", "NTA: If she didn\u2019t have a problem with it before, she\u2019s probably a kid  pushing her limit or she has something going on making her upset or nervous (Even something small like an upcoming test or argument with a friend).", "As a Norwegian this is just about the most laughable thing I've read. \n\nSo weird how people in the US aren't used to physical activity. I think I walked twenty minutes to school one way regardless of the weather when I grew up.\n\nMy sister walked even longer, closer to 30 - up hill. \n\nTell your kid to grow up.", "NTA, as long as it's well lit when it's dark and she's obviously not vulnerable to being snatched.  Those would apply year round, not just when it's raining and cold.", "NTA.  Also, I'm laughing in Canadian right now.  Temperatures dropped this week from 32 (0C) to 14 (-10C).  My kids have a 25 min walk to school (they're 8 and 10) unless it's below 0 fahrenheit.", "NTA but I'd gently remind you she is 10 none of this is about the 3-minute walk apart from the  fact that due to changing hormones, she is FEELING that cold air right now .... if you haven't , get some girly supplies in", "YTA- sounds like you raised a California girl in some awful cold place. I\u2019m on the daughter\u2019s side because I wouldn\u2019t walk it, either. I also wear a sweater when it\u2019s 70 because that\u2019s cold. \n\nCan you have a weather chart so she knows if it\u2019s at x, she gets a ride and if it\u2019s at y, she has to walk?", "NTA. Unless they have to deal with the 1 y/o they have no room to talk. 3 min walk is worth waking my baby up.", "NAH. It is perfectly reasonable to expect her to do the walk and I think it would have been a mistake to give in as then she will expect it which isn't fair on your son. But I won't call a ten year old an AH for being 10 though. She is full of hormones and maybe was just having a bad day.", "NTA we woke up to snow yesterday and today. The kids walked to school both days and will continue to do so when it's -30c. This is life. \n\nSounds pretty normal for a 10yr old lol", "NTA - I was walking to the bus stop and sometimes home from school at that age. It\u2019d be a huge hassle to get the 1 and 4 year old in the car PLUS it\u2019s a 3 min walk", "NTA. My daughter also complains to high heaven if she ever has to walk anywhere. This is a perfectly reasonable expectation and no reason to wake your baby up.", "NTA  \n\n\n3 minutes walk? Hell I was driving my bike to school (a 15 minute bike trip) when I was 10 when it was around 0F. Good boots, good coat and good gloves and she's good to go", "Skimmed this. Fahrenheit is so stupid man.", "LOL then generations of parents were assholes then! Ha ha ha", "NTA, also in the midwest, and my daughter and her friends are still biking 2 miles to school. It's been around 35-38 in the morning and 50s on the way home. She's fine if she dresses appropriately for the weather.", "NTA. I'd imagine her walk is much shorter than the majority of kids at her school that ride the bus.", "NY raised and elementary school was 5 blocks from home. Had to walk it there and back sun, rain or snow from the age of 8 - my mom did not drive at that time. Junior High and High School it was busses and trains to get to school no matter if it rained or snowed. \n\nNTA - Your daughter is 3 minutes from the bus and if you are comfortable letting her walk then a bit of snow or cold is not going to harm her.", "NTA. I live in the southeast US and we get temps like you describe and lower. Not for as many months. Kids walk to bus stops all the time. The disconnect between complaining about the cold and not wearing proper clothing makes it clear this is not a real problem, it\u2019s just her perception. She could be more comfortable if she chose but doesn\u2019t do so. \n\nCommunal bus stops suck for everyone. It\u2019s unfortunate she doesn\u2019t have a ride guaranteed every day. But she\u2019s not being harmed by this.", "A 3 minute walk? NTA and she's lucky she doesn't have to do it every day. We did.", "NTA. For some reason this country has decided that the world revolves around our children and their WANTS. I don't get it.", "Esh.  I've watched news stories where young girls get abducted. ( Google Jaycee Lee Duggard or Fidel Castro ). Stuff is crazy.", "I grew up in northern Michigan.

It is perfectly walkable. Better she learn now the world does not revolve around her. You're too nice. I'd have let her know if she's going to be throwing tantrums when she has to walk, she won't be getting rides at all.", "I grew up in a snow state and walked the third of a mile to school daily. The annoying thing was that occasionally my dad would drive by and wave if he had work in town but he couldn\u2019t give me a lift because it was a business owned car and he wasn\u2019t allowed.", "NTA - In my day she would have walked to school and it was uphill both ways, without a coat and wearing cardboard shoes!", "Agreed.

Unless the child's safety is at risk, a short walk to the bus stop is fine.", "I honestly can't imagine my parents driving me to the bus stop when I was kid unless the weather was bad enough that they would have canceled school anyway.  When you live in the midwest, you just suck it up.", "Yes. My daughter in kindergarten (age 5) had to walk 1.4 km (almost a mile) each way to school.

Mom had her one sibling when they were 6 and just starting school so mom had to balance the two.  A couple years later baby 3 comes out and is only a year old.  Mommy\u2019s attention has been on babies for 4 years and not on daughter.  Not blaming the mom only putting forth an idea through the eyes of daughter.", "It could be something as simple as a test in school coming up or something small like that.", "This. It makes sense that the kid doesn\u2019t want to do this but part of being a parent is building resilience in your kid.", "No, giving in to a tantrum does nothing to help regulate anything.  It teaches the kid to throw a fit whenever they don't get their way.", "Seriously, so mom is supposed to give into the tantrum?? what does that teach the child?? My bus stops were further than a 3 minute walk, and I had to walk in the cold. In High School I walked out the door at 6:05 in the morning to catch the bus - my mom was just getting ready for work at that time.", "Haha. And reward her bad behavior? OP was being a parent and did the right thing. The kid is ten and can easily walk three minutes to the bus. She will regret not wearing proper clothes and do better tomorrow.", "Adults, teenagers, tweens all make stupid decision, that is lame excuse to call OP the AH.\n\nAt some point the kid needs to be in a situation where they have to make the right or wrong decision, without their parents around. \n\nLearning to be independent and realizing the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you are part of growing up.", "I don\u2019t think you know the definition of the word tantrum", "It's 3 minutes. Kids do this every day.", "I live in a southern state so I actually more have a rule that if it\u2019s in the 90s, then I\u2019ll drive them in the afternoon. Other than that the general rule is we walk if it\u2019s not raining and above 30. And I walk with them. My six-year-old has been complaining that I walked to pick him up when the high was 85. I told him to get over it.", "I walked a mile and a half each way, to and from school, in the northeastern US.

At the end of the last school year my younger kid had an event and it was noted that parents \u201cmay\u201d take their child home after if they wanted. It was a lovely day so I walked. Realize that every single child was being taken home so he had to walk home with me and oh the drama. Sorry kid, I wanted a nice stroll before it gets to the temperature of the sun by 9am.", "But the world is not predictable and reliable, you\u2019re doing your child a disservice if you don\u2019t teach them how to cope with and handle change.", "> It harms them when they are not.
