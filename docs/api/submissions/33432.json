Hope your mother is on your side here. Auntie was out of line.", "Your aunt trippin bro", "NTA.\n\nIt is actually entirely possible that your aunt *does* have OCD. OCD is not a collection of symptoms so much as it's a *mechanism.* To have OCD, you just need to have obsessions (intrusive thoughts born of anxiety) and compulsions (actions or compulsive thoughts taken to counteract the anxiety provoked by the obsessions). It's very common for germ fears to be an obsession, and cleaning and sanitation-related behaviors to be a compulsion, but it's not universal. I personally have OCD and have much fewer germ fears than most people (for example, I am not afraid of the toilet, but I am afraid of the kitchen sink) and my compulsions often manifest as tics rather than repeated behaviors. I actually struggle with hygiene and tidiness because my OCD puts me into a state of overwhelm due to the anxiety, and I don't compulsively clean, so it makes it *harder* for me to tidy. \n\nAnd unusual superstitions can also be a sign of OCD-- my grandma, who had OCD, believed that it would protect her family members from dying in airplane crashes if she wore a specific pair of earrings when they flew. It was just an unusual obsession (fear of her family dying) and compulsion (wearing the earrings). Her compulsions also included doing Bible study for hours every day; OCD folks are often more devout/spiritual than average, and religion and spirituality are large components of OCD in some people. So your auntie's crystal superstition *could* actually be a compulsion. Her smell could even be anxiety-related-- lots of people get into crystals and stuff like that because they're *afraid* of side effects from legit products and treatments, and fearmongering about stuff like aluminum in deodorant can cause them to avoid products that would keep them clean. \n\nThat said... you are absolutely unequivocally NTA in this situation anyways, because your auntie had no right to touch you. If she really has OCD, she should know the absolute *torment* that triggering obsessions can cause, and yet she went ahead and hugged you anyways. Forcing someone through something to try to desensitize them *doesn't work* and only ever makes things worse. Desensitization has to happen at a slow pace, and start from a place of feeling safe and supported-- not during a confrontation. And yelling about you being \"unstable\" is not ever going to help, because those kinds of labels just create self-fulfilling prophecies instead of providing support. \n\nI'm sorry that your family is unsupportive and not understanding. Lots of people don't realize how horrible OCD is and what they need to do to actually help it get better. You didn't mention therapy, but perhaps you can parlay this into asking for your parents to get you therapy since they think your reaction was so irrational anyways. I also always recommend the site https://anxieties.com/ which is run by a doctor who I worked with for my own OCD, so I can vouch for the info. It's got lots of self-help techniques and a self-assessment for various kinds of anxiety. It's not a replacement for therapy, but can help as a stopgap until you're able to get therapy or as a supplement to it.", "Because of my past, I do not like being touched, hugged, etc unless I am the one to initiate it, so I completely understand the frantic, although different circumstances.

I'm assuming your aunt is not a therapist so she should not attempt to diagnose you and definitely shouldn't have hugged you without your consent. \n\nBut you have some work to do too. Speak to your mam about getting you an assessment and into therapy. If you do have OCD related to germs, there's work you need to do which could help you learn to live with the disorder. The world is dirty and germs are everywhere, boundaries aren't going to change that. But you can change how you deal with that fact.", "You're definitely not the asshole here. Setting up boundaries, trying to be as clear as possible to everyone as to where they stand, communicating how you feel? That's about the best way to go about it.

I think you need to see a therapist who specializes in ERP therapy. It's the number one therapy for OCD (many experts believe).

Unstable is grabbing hold of people who don't want to be touched and if she's upset at you telling her she smells then maybe there's a crystal that can help her get a grip.", "Uhh your aunt jumped up and forcefully hugged you? That\u2019s kinda assault. I don\u2019t think getting authorities involved would be at all helpful, but you\u2019re definitely NTA. Especially since you clearly have some debilitating mental health issues.", "Sorry to hear what your going thru, I had ocd like that myself, still am a bit of a germaphobe but it\u2019s calmed down a lot, for me it was the combo of smoking weed/getting older/ working out daily all helped with symptoms. I dunno if ur able to get on meds or maybe even get weed but that\u2019s what helped me a lot with ocd. Ur not the asshole here just dumb people will never understand not all minds work the same.", "NTA. Don\u2019t even be nice or associate with her until she genuinely apologizes. I\u2019d cut all contact with her.", "OP is also self diagnosed.", "Thank you for this, I would never assume a person to be self diagnosing or falsely diagnosing themselves. Her and I aren\u2019t close at all, nor have I ever gone into full detail of what it has been like for me to deal with. I got upset over the fact that she was comparing both our situations and saying that she understood my feelings entirely, only seconds later she told me I was overreacting. OCD has many different forms, and she could very well have it, yet what her and I both experience is very different and she has never shown a bit of understanding or care to my situation. I\u2019ve also not been tested for a specific \u201cdiagnosis\u201d or been to therapy, so I wanna clear that here also that I\u2019m not saying I have OCD.", "it happens sometimes when something gets really overwhelming, it kind of completely drains me and I can\u2019t bring myself to do anything. i don\u2019t really know how to explain it, it\u2019s usually when i\u2019ve had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d like the one explained here. i just lose sense of reality really, like nothing feels real, i go sort of in a daze where i stay in my room for months at a time. it\u2019s been like this for a long time it\u2019s not really anything new for me. i didn\u2019t mean to overreact, i never wanted any of this to happen again, i\u2019ve been trying really hard to get out of it or at least force myself to be alright for the people around me but it\u2019s been building for a really long while i\u2019ll admit, and it always ends up being a single occurrence such as this just to bring me back. I guess I just snapped because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be alright the second I was on my own again. I\u2019ll be fine, just right now i\u2019m stuck on how to feel over what both of us did, if what she did was enough to be insulted. I didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone.", "I live with my mam, i just go stay with my dad sometimes. it used to be every weekend but i\u2019ve never really been comfortable there as i\u2019m not very close with his side of the family at all, it makes me feel a bit like an intruder so i rarely go. i keep in close enough contact with my dad and siblings that live with him, however i only hear from his other family members once or twice a year. i think that my auntie and i not being very close also added onto my anger when my she voiced an opinion of my own situation, as she doesn\u2019t really know how it affects me, resulting in me reacting how i did.", "i appreciate this comment, i\u2019d like to clarify though in case anyone else didn\u2019t understand. she did not hug me, she grabbed me. it was done purely because I don\u2019t like being touched and what i had said previously annoyed her enough into doing so. it wasn\u2019t with a comforting intent.", "OP never actually flat out said they had OCD, though.", "Yeah, saying \"I understand your feelings\" and then actively proving she doesn't understand your feelings *at all* was completely unacceptable of her. A lot of people who share the same problems are still somehow incapable of empathy with people in exactly the same situation, so it's really kind of irrelevant whether she has OCD or not, in the end.  \n\nI hope you're able to get diagnosis and treatment, whether that be therapy, medication, or something else. Hopefully that link from my earlier comment will help in the meantime!\n\nOCD is torture, and horrendously misunderstood. It's incredibly hard when people don't understand and aren't supportive. But it can absolutely get better; it's very treatable with the right tools. I just want to make sure you know that you don't have to be trapped in the anxiety forever, and there's a light at the end of the tunnel, as someone who has been through it myself. (Assuming you have OCD, of course. But even if it's something different, the point is that treatment can help and you don't have to suffer like this forever.)", "Your parents need to help you get in a therapist appointment.  There are many medications and therapies that will help you live a more normal life.  Please go and ask them to help you find one.", "Hi OP, it sounds like you\u2019re doing a really great job of identifying that you have a problem and are doing a great job articulating this. I know this must be incredibly difficult for you, you are absolutely valid that this is a difficult thing that you cannot control. It\u2019s important you see a professional psychologist about this. There are techniques and possibly medication that can help you feel more at peace and less sensitive to the world around you. There is hope! Talk to your mom about needing to see a psychologist or specialized therapist. If she doesn\u2019t support this ask to see your doctor, even OBGYN. They should hopefully be able to help encourage your mom to get you help. If they don\u2019t take you seriously try and see a different doctor. If you need help preparing for those conversations people would be happy to help.", "We have the same phobias/ \"awareness.\" I've had OCD since I was 7, and I'm hyper aware of germs. It sucks to live with and is exhausting. \n\nI'd recommend just trying a therapist. Exposure therapy could potentially help you immensely in the correct environment. \n\nSending good vibes your way.", "I don't think this is an overreaction, you have a disorder that you're trying to handle and your aunt purposefully, maliciously triggered it. \n\nMy gf has CPTSD. Extreme, extreme trauma. Sometimes she will make a small mistake and it will send her spiraling for a week. She has been in therapy every week for 8 years to deal with this, and she's gotten so much better - it used to be way worse and I won't explain for the sake of her privacy, but her episodes now are already considered severe, and before therapy... I have no idea how she made it. \n\nYou are not overreacting, this isn't something mildly annoying you and pouting for days. Your brain is literally turning on you and it's clear you're doing everything you can to combat that. just keep it up. this isn't gonna be the thing that takes you down. NTA and your aunt is an insufferable jerk.", "Not therapy specifically (unless I'm reading wrong), they simply say they're trying things which are helping, not what those things are", "From op's emotional view it appears so, but her aunts babbling is trying to relate to her niece, trying to show she understands.  As annoying as that might be she's trying to show she's with her niece, on her side, sharing her struggle because she has ocd \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2d.  Clearly can't understand but also completely oblivious to everything this kids going through internally in the moment.  Would grandma really sit there if bullying was going on?.   It's the op's perception but I doubt the reality.  This doesn't make OP any less innocent in the situation.  She feels what she feels and the aunt crossed her boundary. So nah we didn't read a different post I just don't get emotionally blinded by someone else's perception.", "Did anyone even bother to read after the first sentence? My god", "Ahh ok I always give people the benefit of the doubt because I've never met anyone truly cruel.  And if the source of her actions came from an intent to harm you then you should definitely stay right away from her.  If your family doesn't see the malicious intent they must be insane. Everyone else is the problem your nta.", "you\u2019re right. i\u2019m not in therapy and I haven\u2019t had any proper \u201cdiagnosis\u201d or anything, it\u2019s why I haven\u2019t really claimed a label for it.", "Even worse, but doesn't matter the age to me. My girlfriend's parents are like this and it pisses me off. She keeps finding excuses they are from different times and they grew in the Soviet union and sure, I get it. But you also need to have empathy for your child struggles and don't always belittle them because you had a tougher childhood.", "Okay, but literally any or all of the posts here could be fake. You can't possibly figure them all out, so why not play pretend?", "For the record, you absolutely should look into it if you haven't already. It is very easy to accidentally make things worse on your own without someone to talk to", "I like to think I do a lot of the time, certain ones just reek \n\nHave you ever heard in your life someone literally say \"I couldn't stop sobbing\"? The villain  is a stereotype. Idk bs alarms a firin"]}
