A therapist can help with behavioral strategies to overcome the OCD.

You aren\u2019t in the wrong and I hope she gets karma, or taught a lesson. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the Asshole!\n\nI also don\u2019t like how she self diagnosed herself with OCD.

That's not sustainable and (my opinion only) it's time to get professional help for this.

The type of people who are comfortable weaponizing diagnoses that they are not remotely qualified to make, tend to have one other trait in common\u2026  but I\u2019m not a psychologist, so I\u2019m not gonna diagnose anybody.  Hope your mother is on your side here. Auntie was out of line.", "Your aunt trippin bro", "NTA.\n\nIt is actually entirely possible that your aunt *does* have OCD. OCD is not a collection of symptoms so much as it's a *mechanism.* To have OCD, you just need to have obsessions (intrusive thoughts born of anxiety) and compulsions (actions or compulsive thoughts taken to counteract the anxiety provoked by the obsessions). It's very common for germ fears to be an obsession, and cleaning and sanitation-related behaviors to be a compulsion, but it's not universal. I personally have OCD and have much fewer germ fears than most people (for example, I am not afraid of the toilet, but I am afraid of the kitchen sink) and my compulsions often manifest as tics rather than repeated behaviors. I actually struggle with hygiene and tidiness because my OCD puts me into a state of overwhelm due to the anxiety, and I don't compulsively clean, so it makes it *harder* for me to tidy. \n\nAnd unusual superstitions can also be a sign of OCD-- my grandma, who had OCD, believed that it would protect her family members from dying in airplane crashes if she wore a specific pair of earrings when they flew. It was just an unusual obsession (fear of her family dying) and compulsion (wearing the earrings). Her compulsions also included doing Bible study for hours every day; OCD folks are often more devout/spiritual than average, and religion and spirituality are large components of OCD in some people. So your auntie's crystal superstition *could* actually be a compulsion. Her smell could even be anxiety-related-- lots of people get into crystals and stuff like that because they're *afraid* of side effects from legit products and treatments, and fearmongering about stuff like aluminum in deodorant can cause them to avoid products that would keep them clean. \n\nThat said... you are absolutely unequivocally NTA in this situation anyways, because your auntie had no right to touch you. If she really has OCD, she should know the absolute *torment* that triggering obsessions can cause, and yet she went ahead and hugged you anyways. Forcing someone through something to try to desensitize them *doesn't work* and only ever makes things worse. Desensitization has to happen at a slow pace, and start from a place of feeling safe and supported-- not during a confrontation. And yelling about you being \"unstable\" is not ever going to help, because those kinds of labels just create self-fulfilling prophecies instead of providing support. \n\nI'm sorry that your family is unsupportive and not understanding. Lots of people don't realize how horrible OCD is and what they need to do to actually help it get better. You didn't mention therapy, but perhaps you can parlay this into asking for your parents to get you therapy since they think your reaction was so irrational anyways. I also always recommend the site https://anxieties.com/ which is run by a doctor who I worked with for my own OCD, so I can vouch for the info. It's got lots of self-help techniques and a self-assessment for various kinds of anxiety. It's not a replacement for therapy, but can help as a stopgap until you're able to get therapy or as a supplement to it.", "Because of my past, I do not like being touched, hugged, etc unless I am the one to initiate it, so I completely understand the frantic, although different circumstances. If someone did that to me, I would\u2019ve been way more mean than you were. NTA. And I hope your aunts crystals cleanse her outside like they do on the inside. \ud83d\ude44", "ESH you both have issues.", "NTA, didn't need to read the post but did anyway, if someone stinks then they stink, you're doing them a favour telling them.", "NTA. I'm assuming your aunt is not a therapist so she should not attempt to diagnose you and definitely shouldn't have hugged you without your consent. \n\nBut you have some work to do too. Speak to your mam about getting you an assessment and into therapy. If you do have OCD related to germs, there's work you need to do which could help you learn to live with the disorder. The world is dirty and germs are everywhere, boundaries aren't going to change that. But you can change how you deal with that fact.", "You're definitely not the asshole here. Setting up boundaries, trying to be as clear as possible to everyone as to where they stand, communicating how you feel? That's about the best way to go about it. It prevents you and other people from getting upset. Problem is: it only works if people are willing to actually listen and understand. That failure comes from you aunt, not from you.", "What an AH your \u201cauntie\u201d is! What she did was assault. Why the hell aren\u2019t your parents supporting you?!? They are so wrong in my opinion! I would be livid if someone treated my child this way. \nYour NTA at all. I wish this hadn\u2019t happened to you.", "I have pretty bad OCD as well. You're not the asshole. I hope you get away from all this. Also people need to learn basic hygiene so I would've told her years ago.\n\nIf you need to talk, I'll be around.", "OP, you're NTA, but you do sound like you have OCD. I think you need to see a therapist who specializes in ERP therapy. It's the number one therapy for OCD (many experts believe). It's actually similar to what you're doing by yourself, by trying to get used to people being in your space and touching your things, but you could do it in a safe space with help. I saw it have a night-and-day improvement on my loved one with OCD.\n\nI don't even care about your aunt. She shouldn't have touched you. You're not wrong. But I've seen the impact of OCD firsthand, and you really need to go get some help. You're the one I was worried about in this post.", "NTA.  Your aunt was way out of line.  That being said, as others have stated, your parents should have you working with a professional to learn coping strategies for your \u201cgerm thing\u201d, which yes, sounds a lot like OCD.  You deserve to have your boundaries respected; that being said, you also may be happier and be able to enjoy life more if you get some caring, supportive, real professional help.", "Awww you're nta and I think your auntie loves you, was trying to relate and thinking; in a hug like everyone else you'd feel the love.   But she's crossed a boundary she should've respected.  It's not your fault you have these issues and people need to be more aware and respectful when someone is struggling with anything.  Keep trying to overcome and eventually you will.  Baby steps you're ok \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb compliment yourself for every little thing you achieve in the day even if it's just getting up washing your face and brushing your teeth.
