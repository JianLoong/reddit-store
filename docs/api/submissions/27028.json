It's a power move. \n\nGotta establish dominance before you discuss uncomfortable topics.", "Easements are easier to prove than adverse possession though", "A lot of areas require exclusive use of the area as well though, and given the driveway is completely open they\u2019d be hard pressed to prove that if it is required.", "True", "An easement would have been found when the survey was performed. Surveys typically start with a search of title so that the surveyor knows what they are looking to survey.

If they have been using it without paying taxes but paid to have it sealed that might not be enough. The time period is also a variable in every location. Some places it's 5 years some it's 20 so it's still up in the air.", "Fair. Im also just not trusting OP to be 100% accurate but fair.", "I\u2019m currently dealing with a fence dispute with a neighbour. He likes where the old fence is (built prior to my move in). I have a survey showing the existing fence is on my property by about a foot. He says let\u2019s just agree to disagree and leave it where it is. I say his opinion doesn\u2019t hold as much weight as the survey I had done two years ago. We\u2019ll see how it plays out."]}
