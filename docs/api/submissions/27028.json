I had to do it when, in an almost identical issue to yours, our neighbors kept using our driveway as their own walkway to their backyard, having their lawn service use it to cut their grass with large riding mowers that clipped my car multiple times, and would have their children use it as their play area around my car and nearly got them run over when I pulled in not knowing they were sitting directly in my driveway hidden by their mom\u2019s car. \nAsking them nicely never worked, changing my parking habits did nothing, so finally I made the call and secured my side of the driveway with a four foot chainlink and double wide gate. \n\nHaven\u2019t had a single issue since, they keep to theirs and I as always, keep to mine. \n\nThey\u2019re not going go to work with you on this, even if you try to be nice, you\u2019ll end up having a headache any time they see fit to give you one.\nBite the bullet now and get that fence put in, even if it just runs the length of the driveway.", "Speak to a property /real estate  lawyer and make sure you are legally in the clear for your jurisdiction.

Adverse possession doesn't happen overnight and the fact that OP didn't know that part of the driveway was on their land when they purchased the place suggests that previous owner also wasn't aware that they were potentially slowly giving their neighbor land either. I'm certainly not saying it couldn't potentially get messy but I'm also not a lawyer. Either way finding out WTA is should be the least of OP's concerns right now.", "Or maybe a previous owner didn't have a car and didn't care. Or preferred to park in the street.", "It was cheaper for a developer to pave six wide driveways and curb-cuts than 12 narrow ones, and in the 50s-60s era of one-car households, it didn't make much difference, but people these days don't like sharing for exactly this reason, and the fashion has died out.", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adverse-possession.asp\n\nContinuous use - check, they claim to have used it for decades\nHostile and adverse occupation of the property - no agreement to use the driveway was conveyed to the new owner.\nOpen and notorious possession - it doesn't get more open and notorious than vehicles parked on pavement\nActual possession - we can't make any determinations without knowing the specific state but they have mentioned multiple decades which gives this high odds.\nExclusive use - sounds like only the neighbor has been using it for years. Even OP was unaware it was on their land until they had a survey, suggests even the previous owner was unaware that their neighbor was working towards adverse possession of their land.\n\nOP very much needs to consult an attorney and get in front of this. Land doesn't just grow on trees and while it didn't seem like the neighbor put up much of a fight during this confrontation that certainly doesn't mean they won't try to \"win the war\".", "Almost half the states also require the occupant to pay the property taxes for the statutory period, though some have exceptions."]}
