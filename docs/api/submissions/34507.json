We drove through a winter storm during the first few hours of our drive on the second day. The storm created icy road conditions, periods of poor visibility, and eventually an accident that led to us sitting in stop and go traffic for quite some time. My husband has done a lot of driving in his life, but does make me nervous because he\u2019s a distracted driver and uses his phone while driving. This means sometimes I see things up ahead before he does and he hits the brakes harder or more suddenly than if he hadn\u2019t been distracted. \n\nWhile we were sitting in traffic, both kids started crying. This is typical for sitting in traffic - they\u2019re happier in the car while we\u2019re moving. It was also about the time that our 4-month old should be starting to get hungry. I started trying to distract/entertain the kids to keep them happy. My husband mentioned a couple times that I should just take our youngest out of her car seat and feed her. We were only going a few miles/hour in stop and go traffic, on an icy road, surrounded by semi trucks. There was an exit coming up that would take about 10 minutes to get to, and I decided I\u2019d wait until we could get off the freeway and pull over. By the time we got to the exit, traffic had started to pick up again, we were going 40mph, and our youngest wasn\u2019t crying anymore, so my husband kept driving. A few minutes later we were in stop and go again and she was crying again. He ended up angrily pulling over and feeding her himself (at that point he wouldn\u2019t let me, and I was worried if I was feeding her he\u2019d keep driving again anyway). \n\nHe maintains that I was being \u201cpsycho\u201d and \u201cneglectful\u201d for not wanting to get her out of her car seat when we were driving \u201cas fast as I can walk\u201d while she was clearly hungry. I feel that traffic can pick back up unexpectedly and we were in conditions that didn\u2019t feel safe, even if we were going so slowly. \n\nAITA for not getting my daughter out of her seat in stop and go traffic to feed her when she was clearly hungry?\n\nEDIT: I did try feeding her in her car seat first, but since there isn\u2019t room between the car seats for me to sit and buckle up, this was also unsafe as I was then unbuckled. She wouldn\u2019t take the bottle in her seat anyway. \n\nThank you for the replies. If anything, this has given me the very necessary reminder that I need to do something about his distracted driving in the instances that I can control it, despite how he reacts, including being the only driver myself if necessary.", "created_utc": 1704614471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190n8j4/aita_for_letting_my_baby_cry_when_she_was_hungry/", "score": 1495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That he doesn\u2019t read messages till he gets where he\u2019s getting. If I had seen him do any of those things again he\u2019d never be driving our kids about ever. I\u2019ll admit I was annoyed and did say he can do what he likes when it\u2019s just him in the car but not with our son in the back. He actually apologised and said he didn\u2019t think and guess what now he doesn\u2019t touch his phone for anything. It rings he leaves it to ring and calls them back when he stops.

If this is a one-off, he should apologize and you can both move on. \n\nBe careful if this is a pattern of behavior though, it can be a part of emotional abuse. Keep in mind, abusers don't necessarily consciously mean to cause harm, but that doesn't make their actions any less harmful. People with good intentions and bad models of behavior can improve through counseling. People who don't care that they're doing harm won't, and might weaponize therapy against you.

I live and drive in Michigan, so I know winter roads and driving conditions, and even a slow-moving car can slide into a ditch or another vehicle, or get hit and sent into another car.

If he can't handle the baby crying because she's hungry, why did he want to have kids? And why on earth would he pass up the next exit just because she stopped crying for the time being? Not to mention his cell phone usage while driving. I do not care who I'm in the car with, if they start to use their phone for anything, I immediately say put that shit down. And I am not sorry at all. I have a friend who gets a little pissy at me at times and has snapped back a couple times that she was just checking the time or this or that. But she didn't need to period. If it was really checking the time she could ask me. I even say I don't care how many times you have to pull over or I would rather you pull over multiple times than to cause a crash. Or she could even let me drive. Eventually she did start asking me to drive some. And make no mistake, it's not an accident but a crash if you're driving distracted. If I had my kids in the car, no way would I be putting up with someone driving distracted. If he wants to risk his own life out of stupidity so be it. But he has no right to risk your kids lives. He can think it's ok and he'll never crash all he wants but it just takes that one singular time being distracted for a second or two and that's it.

I wouldn\u2019t take the kid out either. Even if the driver was always paying attention. Better a crying hungry kid that safely in their seat in case something happens than one in your arms if something happens. Also just pulling off to the side of the road and feeding is just as dangerous because another vehicle could hit you especially in those conditions.

As well as telling me I\u2019m trying to control him.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He yells at her when she tries to bring up safety, he manipulates her by not giving the baby back when he\u2019s feeding her. She\u2019s a victim of her husband. It can be very difficult to leave an abusive situation. And if she refuses to get in the car, she doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do. He might grab the kids and go anyway. He could potentially get violent.", "It sounds like you walk on eggshells to try and avoid his explosive anger. That is not healthy. This is how abusers shut down conversation to get what they want. Is this what you want for you and your children?", "I'm sorry but he sounds abusive. He is the one with control issues and he is turning them backwards onto you. This is what manipulative abusive people do. \n\nThe line where you said he wouldn't LET you feed the baby? That's not ok. He is the problem. \n\nI hope you and the kids get away from him.", "Leave him. Seriously.", "I did not know that, thanks. I've never had kids so I've never driven with friends babies without them. \n\nThank you for answering rather than just downvoting me.", "No, that's 2 under 16!", "Would you say the same about getting in the car with a drunk driver?", "There was a period of time in the UK, about 16 years ago (just before my eldest was born) where, despite there being laws about not using your phone whilst driving, everyone continued to do it, my OH included.\nWork calls were the worst. He had a Bluetooth headset, big bulky thing, sat over & around his ear and had about 20 buttons on it. So bloody complicated to use, it was easier to just pick the phone up!\nThe minute our kid was born, I told him he would never again answer a call whilst driving with us in the car (what he did when he was alone was up to him, but I wasn't arranging his funeral if that was the outcome) The advice was changing about when it was safe to go out with newborns, but generally accepted that keeping them inside for the first 10 days was safest. After 2 weeks, we were going to visit a friend who lived about 5 miles away, and surprise surprise, he answered a call whilst driving.\nI made him pull over, got out of the car with my 2 week old & proceeded to walk the rest of the way to my friend's (not the best move!) He went home in a huff, to be greeted with the sight of a letter on the doormat, from the police, telling him he'd been spotted on the phone the week before & they were taking him to court, fining him and/or points on licence.\nHe's never done it again.", "The airbag would kill a 4 month old.", "True, but harder for OP to force.", "No you get divorced, and bring up their driving habits to the cops, and hope they get caught distracted driving so you can use that shit to keep your children out of their freaking car."]}
