The storm created icy road conditions, periods of poor visibility, and eventually an accident that led to us sitting in stop and go traffic for quite some time. My husband has done a lot of driving in his life, but does make me nervous because he\u2019s a distracted driver and uses his phone while driving. This means sometimes I see things up ahead before he does and he hits the brakes harder or more suddenly than if he hadn\u2019t been distracted. \n\nWhile we were sitting in traffic, both kids started crying. This is typical for sitting in traffic - they\u2019re happier in the car while we\u2019re moving. It was also about the time that our 4-month old should be starting to get hungry. I started trying to distract/entertain the kids to keep them happy. My husband mentioned a couple times that I should just take our youngest out of her car seat and feed her. We were only going a few miles/hour in stop and go traffic, on an icy road, surrounded by semi trucks. There was an exit coming up that would take about 10 minutes to get to, and I decided I\u2019d wait until we could get off the freeway and pull over. By the time we got to the exit, traffic had started to pick up again, we were going 40mph, and our youngest wasn\u2019t crying anymore, so my husband kept driving. A few minutes later we were in stop and go again and she was crying again.

However you are too for knowing what type of driver he is and still putting your kids in the car when he\u2019s behind the wheel. I also get it could be difficult you have places to be and perhaps you don\u2019t drive but at the very least you need a open and honest conversation with him about why him being on his phone is unsafe why it\u2019s unsafe to get a baby out the seat. A child won\u2019t die being upset and waiting ten minutes for some food but they very well might with him as a driver. \n\nNow I get it, I myself don\u2019t drive and we have four kids.

I told him then and there that in future he sorts his music before he gets in the car and if it\u2019s something he wants to skip and I\u2019m with him he asks me. That he doesn\u2019t read messages till he gets where he\u2019s getting. If I had seen him do any of those things again he\u2019d never be driving our kids about ever. I\u2019ll admit I was annoyed and did say he can do what he likes when it\u2019s just him in the car but not with our son in the back. He actually apologised and said he didn\u2019t think and guess what now he doesn\u2019t touch his phone for anything. It rings he leaves it to ring and calls them back when he stops.
