It's annoying for you that your parents have forgotten that, but it's entirely normal.  And, no, it doesn't lead toddlers to become little thieves.

Many kids will eat when they\u2019re *starving* which is something a child should never never be! If you starve children to the point where they\u2019ll eat what you give them, it is so damaging to their developing bodies and brains. Everyone has different tastes, kids are not different. Not to mention that many children with cognitive disabilities or eating disorders won\u2019t eat no matter how starving they are! \n\nHe\u2019s a young kid. You do what you need to do to keep them fed. Idk why everyone decides when a kid can walk and talk they now don\u2019t get any form of freedom or preference when it comes to food.

That being said I think it should be a stepping stone to a better solution. I've worked in preschools before and it is very frustrating when parents don't work with their kids when it comes to food, and it can impede their growth. It sounds like you are feeding your kid and have his best interests at heart. \n\nI also don't think it's a bad thing to have him sit at the table with his family and learn to eat his own food. Obviously make sure he isn't wasting away, but sometimes children need a little push to get them on the right track. If he eats less for a little bit of his own volition that's fine, if his health is being effected then you can look into another solution.", "NTA - if you make it a temporary solution.  Toddlers change from day to day, week to week.  Next week he may demand his own plate.  So do what you need to do to make sure he eats.  However - don't start using dips/ketchup as a way to try to get him to eat food.  This is why we now have 21-year-olds who must dump ranch dressing on everything they consume, regardless of what it is. \n\nIt's actually a good thing that your parents are having you eat dinner with them - their tactics are wrong, but it's good to have your child learn to eat in a large family setting.", "NTA.

Also all these people saying you need to \"break the habit\" are not taking into account that it's actually a normal thing to share food in many cultures.

Basically, toddlers eat with their parents in the same plate. They copy and mimics and eat as much as they need this way. There is a lot less struggle involved for the whole family.\n\nI remember in Bali, family don't even eat all together except on special days. They live and work together, but each person eat when they want, when they are hungry. The grandma or someone else would prepare a big pot of whatever on the menu that day, there is always rice with it, and that's it.

If no, listen to why and see if there is a modification that addresses those concerns.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t go well, you should really look into a different living arrangement.

Children do have a voice and how they feel is valid and deserves to be heard/honored.

Some examples:\n\n\u2022Using simple instructions like \u201cfirst we each eat our own plates, then we watch ___ tv show!\u201d \n\n\u2022Getting everyone in on it and when he takes 2-3 bites from his plate, he gets a ton of praise/high fives/tickles \n\n\u2022Before dinner offer 2 types of his favorite sweet treat and tell him which ever one he chose, he gets to eat if he eats the protein/veggie/whatever from his own plate. \n\nThe main thing is consistent instruction and reinforcement until he is doing it so independently that he doesn\u2019t even need any of that anymore.

It turned out i have ARFID due to autism.\n\nI lived with my grandparents until i was five and im greatfull they let my mum take the lead with my parenting, because if i had been forced i don't think i'd of ever felt comfortable enough to try expanding my food when i was older\n\nYour son is eating, all that matters at this age is that he is fed , bonus points if theres vegetables and protein in there!", "NTA \n\nSharing a meal isn\u2019t a moral failing .
