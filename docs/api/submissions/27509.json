Pretending that it was his was how my husband got our oldest to eat broccoli.  Pretending that they were all his was how he got him to wear hats when they were cold.  This is how toddlers are.  It's annoying for you that your parents have forgotten that, but it's entirely normal.  And, no, it doesn't lead toddlers to become little thieves.

Many kids will eat when they\u2019re *starving* which is something a child should never never be! If you starve children to the point where they\u2019ll eat what you give them, it is so damaging to their developing bodies and brains. Everyone has different tastes, kids are not different. Not to mention that many children with cognitive disabilities or eating disorders won\u2019t eat no matter how starving they are! \n\nHe\u2019s a young kid. You do what you need to do to keep them fed. Idk why everyone decides when a kid can walk and talk they now don\u2019t get any form of freedom or preference when it comes to food.

That being said I think it should be a stepping stone to a better solution. I've worked in preschools before and it is very frustrating when parents don't work with their kids when it comes to food, and it can impede their growth. It sounds like you are feeding your kid and have his best interests at heart. \n\nI also don't think it's a bad thing to have him sit at the table with his family and learn to eat his own food. Obviously make sure he isn't wasting away, but sometimes children need a little push to get them on the right track. If he eats less for a little bit of his own volition that's fine, if his health is being effected then you can look into another solution.", "NTA - if you make it a temporary solution.  Toddlers change from day to day, week to week.  Next week he may demand his own plate.  So do what you need to do to make sure he eats.  However - don't start using dips/ketchup as a way to try to get him to eat food.  This is why we now have 21-year-olds who must dump ranch dressing on everything they consume, regardless of what it is. \n\nIt's actually a good thing that your parents are having you eat dinner with them - their tactics are wrong, but it's good to have your child learn to eat in a large family setting.", "NTA.

Also all these people saying you need to \"break the habit\" are not taking into account that it's actually a normal thing to share food in many cultures.

And if they'll only eat that varied diet if it's from your plate, not theirs, then so be it.", "\"Picky\" eating has nothing to do with the mother or what she consumes.\n\nWhere tf did you come up with THAT??\n\nIf this theory were actually worth the half a byte of data it consumed, I wouldn't be a \"picky\" eater. My mom at least tried nearly anything that wouldn't bite her first and I'm the exact opposite. \n\n\"Picky\" eating can be a multitude of things. Sensory issues, taste, look...there's a thousand reasons a person might not like certain foods. Putting it on the mother is ignorant and false.", "I\u2019m a Latina. Ate ALL my fav foods while pregnant. My husband is as white as a cracker and has so many stomach problems & is gf. You know how hard it is to be with someone who has a completely diff palate than you.? Really hard. Well his eating ways passed down to our son. My kid won\u2019t even eat tortillas now. Like, what kid doesn\u2019t want to have a quesadilla? He is so gung-ho on mac n cheese that it\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve tried to bring him some concha\u2019s before and he didn\u2019t even want to try that! So maybe your theory has only worked for you, but I sooo wish my kid could eat good like me \ud83d\ude29 our son does see us both eating everything but he still has his reservations. He\u2019ll grow out of it soon enough like my eldest grew out of his \u201conly eating pizza\u201d ways.", "Lol, wut?", "It\u2019s an obnoxious \u201cjoke\u201d intended to cut down young parents who are obviously already aware their situation isn\u2019t ideal.", "Ok? I'm so impressed?", "Honestly? Her laughing didn't bother me. There was a lot of \"Mom, you're not helping\" though. That just made her laugh harder. \n\nI laugh now but in the moment, I was NOT finding it funny at all. lol\n\nOf course, it helps if you realize my mother was notoriously chill when it came to anything that didn't involve an injury. \n\nPaint the cat green? lol\n\nScratch the TV with your stick horse? lol\n\nGet your hand caught in the hole for the coocoo clock and have to sit there while I take it apart? lmao every few minutes for over an hour.\n\nBreak your arm falling out of a tree? To the hospital we go! (No lol)\n\nMiss that woman every day.", "Yes! My kid prefers my husband\u2019s pho cause mines not quite as spicy \ud83e\udd23", "Lol your comment reminded me of my mum. She's a doctor so she didn't put any salt into my youngest brother's baby foods until he hit about 11 months old. Cue a toddler who would happily eat ketchup and nori sandwiches... \n\nHonestly I was the most picky of three kids and it turned out to primarily be a texture aversion to things like slimy overcooked bean sprouts and stir fried eggplant... (though I did get better about it as I grew up).", "aww thats a shame, I wish I could give you some advice.. Kid will eat mac n cheese but not a quesadilla is just so fucking hilarious to me Im still laughing about it.", "I never grew out of this \u201conly eating pizza\u201d phase. In fact I think I only picked it up in adulthood \ud83d\ude02", "I've heard about a really interesting way to try to get toddlers to eat better. At each family dinner, you have a \"try it\" plate of something new--one or two bites is fine. It may take them several tries to be brave enough to eat the new food, and then even more tries to actually like it. The point is, there's no pressure and it's not on the same plate as the rest of their food so it's less intimidating."]}
