She's always been passionate about her beliefs, but now she's taken it to a whole new level.\n\nLast weekend, we had a family barbecue, and my sister refused to attend because we were grilling meat. She claimed it was unethical and she couldn't be around it. Fine, her choice, right? But here's where it gets spicy.\n\nShe's been pestering me (27F) and my fiance (28M) about our diet choices, trying to guilt-trip us into going vegan too. She sends us graphic videos of animal cruelty and lectures us about the environmental impact of eating meat. She even said she won't come to our house anymore if we continue eating animal products.\n\nI lost my temper and told her that she can't impose her vegan lifestyle on our family and that she's being overly dramatic. I may have used some choice words in the heat of the moment. Now, she's telling the entire family that I'm insensitive and disrespectful.\n\nI believe in respecting her choices, but she's going way too far by trying to dictate what we eat and making ultimatums.

I find people like your sister find being dismissed far more frustrating than evoking the reaction they want.", "Nta.  You are seeing a boundary.  Hey behavior is awful and she is being the asshole.", "NTA. Respect all religions and beliefs, but immediately dump anybody who pesters you to change yours.", "NTA\n\nI don't respect anyone like that. I'd tell her I don't allow dicktaters over at my house anyways.", "NTA.  As simple as that.  She's joined a cult and is trying to get others to go with her.  Vegans get a bad rap because of this kind of person; most vegans are not like that. She's an asshole.", "NTA. I believe in respecting other people\u2019s dietary requirements and preferences (whether due to allergy, intolerances or just personal choice) and catering for those requirements and preferences unless absolutely impossible to do so but I draw the line at trying to impose a chosen lifestyle on other households. \n\nYour sister needs to realise she is perfectly welcome to lead a vegan life but she cannot expect anyone else to follow her if they do not wish to.", "NTA. Fanatics are always a pain in the ass.", "If you want to be petty, you could point out \u201cthis is *exactly* why people hate vegans\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s the truth. Nothing is worse than a vegan on a mission to \u201csave the world\u201d\n\nNext time she sends you videos, ask her if she knows how many animals were brutally murdered or maimed when farmers clear cut their land in preparation for farming? \n\nHow many are killed when they do an agricultural burn to their lands to clear out crop residuals?\nHow many gorillas are slaughtered when palm oil is harvested?\n\nThe list goes on and on. Start doing your research, so you can educate her on the harm veganism does to animals. Does she care about the environment as well? Ask her if she knows how bad almonds are for the environment? They take a TON of water to grow (1.1L per ALMOND nut, not plant to be exact) and they are primarily grown in California. Which has been in a drought for like 20 years now\n\nNTA, but you may need to weaponize her beliefs against her. Yes that will kinda make you the A, but she needs to understand that veganism isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be \n\n\n(Most of these bits of information I\u2019m recalling from memory from a few years back, it\u2019s after midnight where I am, so I maybe off a little bit)", "NTA.\n\nIn my experience this is a temporary thing a lot of new vegans go through and they eventually relax. YMMV but just hold your boundaries firm while continuing to respect her choices (e.g., don't try to sneak animal products into meals, don't harangue her about how good bacon is, etc.) and, hopefully, her fervor will subside.", "NTA\n\nWasn't this a Simpsons episode?  \"You don't win friends with salad!\"\n\nI think Roseanne had a similar episode.", "NTA. Her current lifestyle does not need to be a militant family bandwagon! This behavior is why I never had vegan friends when I WAS vegan. \n\nI stopped trying to make vegan friends then (in the days of Meet Ups) because they would go nuts on me saying that I wasn't truly vegan if my cat wasn't also on a vegan diet. Pure insanity.", "NTA. Tell the whole family the truth - she's harassing you & DH about your food choices. Don't stoop to petty revenge, just don't invite her until she will agree to not say a word about going vegan. Then, do make sure there are some vegan options for her and see if she can keep her word.

Behaviour like this is why a lot vegans get hate.", "Your sister is a moron and needs to stop evangelizing you. Cut her off.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing(and granted it's just a guess, but an educated one) that she's only gone vegan because it's the latest fad and it makes her feel superior to everyone else. \n\nSending you those videos and being dramatic about the ethics of meat eating by sending cruelty vids is very possibly her way of showing you just how much better than you she thinks she is.", "The vegan lifestyle is responsible for more animal/insect destruction than any other as farmers will destroy anything that could harm their group. Not to mention the environmental damage done by trucks/planes shipping produce around the world. She needs to stop being a hypocrite, unless she only eats what she herself personally grows. NTA", "NTA, this is why you never trust anyone who makes things that are not moral issues into a moral issue.", "NTA though it sounds like you\u2019re glossing over what exactly you said that might make you TA even though setting boundaries isn\u2019t a bad thing.", "YTAH for sure. You should change your entire life to fit her feelings Lmaooooo. Jk obviously NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m vegan and get where she\u2019s coming from, but yes trying to cut off family isn\u2019t a good strategy. She\u2019s a new believer and you can compare this with the \u2018new believer high\u2019 when someone converts to a new religion or philosophy. You know the annoying new Christians always evangelizing and talking over you\u2026 \n\nTo her, she sees the cruelty and the horrible shit we do to animals. She wants to stop it and doesn\u2019t understand why everyone is doing it. You talk of imposing a diet choice, to her she hears you want to impose torture and pain and death on innocent animals. Ultimately that\u2019s what it is. You could choose a vegan burger or a burger made of someone who wanted to live and it sounds like a horrible choice\u2026 but yeah absolutely the way she\u2019s doing that tho of course isn\u2019t effective here. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s like the new believer high, caught up in her new way of seeing the world to deal individually with the person in front of her. And to see what\u2019s the most effective way of reaching them. \n\nSo are you an asshole for telling you vegan sister she can\u2019t impose her lifestyle on you? No. Especially threatening to cut off all contact is self-defeating and a poor strategy for social movements. It doesn\u2019t work. If she\u2019s saying you\u2019re insensitive and disrespectful to her just because you told her she can\u2019t impose that, obviously NTA. You say you lost your temper tho so sounds like you did more than just say that\u2026 for her to say you were insensitive and disrespectful to *her* suggests you said something more personal - but only you know what you said in anger. \n\nNo doubt some people will just read me saying I\u2019m vegan and downvote immediately and reply the usual silly nonsense. In reality, everything is more nuanced. \n\nHopefully your sister can find people who understand the issues and have the experience to get her through the initial stages of that \u2018new believer high\u2019. Cos yeah the damage she\u2019s doing to relationships is hard to get back. Very few people listen well to someone shouting at them, rather than talking with them.", "NTA.   Talk to her about God. Or how she can save 10% with Geico. By doing this, try to point out that it's your business what you choose to eat, and talking about veganism is not interesting to you. Indifference will work better for you than getting upset, because there are a lot of people who want to upset you, who think they're making progress if they can affect you that much.

This is her personal choice and sending media like that is wrong. I'd block her so she can't send you things you don't want to see.

Honestly the case is very much unclear. Meat can be raised in places where we can't grow stuff for our own consumption, and there's a lot of measures of environmental impact and health impact.", "NTA.

Growing food for animal feed and then killing the animal does more destruction (deforestation and destruction of habitat and creates more emissions) than growing food directly for humans would.

Animal agriculture uses nearly 80% of farmland and produces only 20% of the calories (only 1/3 of protein).
