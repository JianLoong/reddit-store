I'd tell her I don't allow dicktaters over at my house anyways.", "NTA.  As simple as that.  She's joined a cult and is trying to get others to go with her.

Fanatics are always a pain in the ass.", "If you want to be petty, you could point out \u201cthis is *exactly* why people hate vegans\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s the truth. Nothing is worse than a vegan on a mission to \u201csave the world\u201d\n\nNext time she sends you videos, ask her if she knows how many animals were brutally murdered or maimed when farmers clear cut their land in preparation for farming? \n\nHow many are killed when they do an agricultural burn to their lands to clear out crop residuals?\nHow many gorillas are slaughtered when palm oil is harvested?\n\nThe list goes on and on. Start doing your research, so you can educate her on the harm veganism does to animals. Does she care about the environment as well? Ask her if she knows how bad almonds are for the environment? They take a TON of water to grow (1.1L per ALMOND nut, not plant to be exact) and they are primarily grown in California. Which has been in a drought for like 20 years now\n\nNTA, but you may need to weaponize her beliefs against her. Yes that will kinda make you the A, but she needs to understand that veganism isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be \n\n\n(Most of these bits of information I\u2019m recalling from memory from a few years back, it\u2019s after midnight where I am, so I maybe off a little bit)\n\n\n\nETA: It\u2019s been about 7 hours since my original comment and I\u2019ve clearly touched a nerve here lol. \n\nthe reality is, whether or not veganism is better or not isn\u2019t the point. The point is, trying to browbeat/bully those around you isn\u2019t going to change people\u2019s minds. And they\u2019re just going to dig in their heels out of spite \n\nWhen people behave like the sister is, it just comes across as a performance piece. That they\u2019re saying/doing this for the shock value\n\nVeganism isn\u2019t realistic for a lot of folks, whether it\u2019s because they live in a \u201cfood desert\u201d or meat alternatives are way more expensive (and I\u2019ve tried them, used to work at a grocery store and they did samples. That stuff was nasty) or they have allergies to the main ingredients in meat alternatives\n\nAnd some people just love the taste of meat. Me personally? I\u2019d eat steak raw if I could. If scientists are able to lab grow meat the looks and tastes like real meat, or better and it\u2019s the same price or cheaper, I\u2019d probably switch. But until then, \u201csteak is on the menu tonight boys!\u201d\n\nOh and for those who want to be more ethical but are ready to fully give up meat yet? Try to eat as locally as possible. I believe it\u2019s referred to as \u201cthe 100mile/km diet\u201d. Try to avoid fast fashion, thrift your clothing when possible, try not to waste food, grow your own fruits and veggies when possible\n\nAnd look at your information sources with a critical eye, I did look into veganism a few years back, but everything in favour for it, came from random blogs and unverified/questionable sources. Whereas sites with a more balanced, educated take, were from reputable sources\n\nThink critically, be mindful of your choices, whether you eat meat or don\u2019t eat meat is a personal choice and browbeating those around you isn\u2019t going to change minds\n\nEdit 2 I forgot to add this earlier. Let\u2019s not forget the top meat alternatives (soy and nuts) are also the top anaphylaxis allergies. So what are people who allergic supposed to do? I know, let\u2019s let them die, their genes are weak and should be removed from the gene pool. What about those whose bodies can\u2019t absorb protein from non animal sources? Too fucking bad right?\n\nNow we\u2019re getting into eugenics, and that my folks is a very slippery slope\n\nHow about the fact, being a healthy vegan takes a lot of time, energy, money and desire. And most of us don\u2019t have that\n\nThere is also a small group of \u201cvegans\u201d who use it to hide eating disorders. But becoming vegan/vegetarian has helped some folks in their recovery from their eating disorder\n\nThere are pros and cons to being vegan, just like pretty much everything else in this world", "NTA.\n\nIn my experience this is a temporary thing a lot of new vegans go through and they eventually relax. YMMV but just hold your boundaries firm while continuing to respect her choices (e.g., don't try to sneak animal products into meals, don't harangue her about how good bacon is, etc.) and, hopefully, her fervor will subside.", "NTA\n\nWasn't this a Simpsons episode?  \"You don't win friends with salad!\"\n\nI think Roseanne had a similar episode.", "NTA. Her current lifestyle does not need to be a militant family bandwagon! This behavior is why I never had vegan friends when I WAS vegan. \n\nI stopped trying to make vegan friends then (in the days of Meet Ups) because they would go nuts on me saying that I wasn't truly vegan if my cat wasn't also on a vegan diet. Pure insanity.", "NTA. Tell the whole family the truth - she's harassing you & DH about your food choices. Don't stoop to petty revenge, just don't invite her until she will agree to not say a word about going vegan. Then, do make sure there are some vegan options for her and see if she can keep her word. Pasta salad with lots of veggies in it and any meat or cheese is on the side.", "NTA. She\u2019s still young and thinks she\u2019s smarter than everyone else.

Not everyone can be vegan for their own health reasons.", "NTA - and ask about all the little critters who are  destroyed when the plow breaks the soil.", "NTA I'm vegetarian but I never force my choice on other people or guilt trip them. \nIt's her choice, if she doesn't want to come it's her choice but she should consider that the relationship between you may suffer\n\nIt's good you told her that, she needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her and in real life no one would or should accommodate this behaviour .

Behaviour like this is why a lot vegans get hate.", "Your sister is a moron and needs to stop evangelizing you. Cut her off.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing(and granted it's just a guess, but an educated one) that she's only gone vegan because it's the latest fad and it makes her feel superior to everyone else. \n\nSending you those videos and being dramatic about the ethics of meat eating by sending cruelty vids is very possibly her way of showing you just how much better than you she thinks she is.", "The vegan lifestyle is responsible for more animal/insect destruction than any other as farmers will destroy anything that could harm their group. Not to mention the environmental damage done by trucks/planes shipping produce around the world. She needs to stop being a hypocrite, unless she only eats what she herself personally grows. NTA", "NTA, this is why you never trust anyone who makes things that are not moral issues into a moral issue.", "NTA though it sounds like you\u2019re glossing over what exactly you said that might make you TA even though setting boundaries isn\u2019t a bad thing.", "YTAH for sure. You should change your entire life to fit her feelings Lmaooooo. Jk obviously NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m vegan and get where she\u2019s coming from, but yes trying to cut off family isn\u2019t a good strategy. She\u2019s a new believer and you can compare this with the \u2018new believer high\u2019 when someone converts to a new religion or philosophy. You know the annoying new Christians always evangelizing and talking over you\u2026 \n\nTo her, she sees the cruelty and the horrible shit we do to animals. She wants to stop it and doesn\u2019t understand why everyone is doing it. You talk of imposing a diet choice, to her she hears you want to impose torture and pain and death on innocent animals. Ultimately that\u2019s what it is. You could choose a vegan burger or a burger made of someone who wanted to live and it sounds like a horrible choice\u2026 but yeah absolutely the way she\u2019s doing that tho of course isn\u2019t effective here. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s like the new believer high, caught up in her new way of seeing the world to deal individually with the person in front of her. And to see what\u2019s the most effective way of reaching them. \n\nSo are you an asshole for telling you vegan sister she can\u2019t impose her lifestyle on you? No. Especially threatening to cut off all contact is self-defeating and a poor strategy for social movements. It doesn\u2019t work. If she\u2019s saying you\u2019re insensitive and disrespectful to her just because you told her she can\u2019t impose that, obviously NTA. You say you lost your temper tho so sounds like you did more than just say that\u2026 for her to say you were insensitive and disrespectful to *her* suggests you said something more personal - but only you know what you said in anger. \n\nNo doubt some people will just read me saying I\u2019m vegan and downvote immediately and reply the usual silly nonsense. In reality, everything is more nuanced. \n\nHopefully your sister can find people who understand the issues and have the experience to get her through the initial stages of that \u2018new believer high\u2019. Cos yeah the damage she\u2019s doing to relationships is hard to get back. Very few people listen well to someone shouting at them, rather than talking with them.", "NTA.   Talk to her about God. Or how she can save 10% with Geico. By doing this, try to point out that it's your business what you choose to eat, and talking about veganism is not interesting to you. Indifference will work better for you than getting upset, because there are a lot of people who want to upset you, who think they're making progress if they can affect you that much.

Growing food for animal feed and then killing the animal does more destruction (deforestation and destruction of habitat and creates more emissions) than growing food directly for humans would. Animal agriculture is leading causes of deforestation still, clearing space for pasture (40%) and animal feed (up to another 20%).

Growing crops uses natural nutrients and such from the ground. Repeatedly using the same field destroys the ground eventully. You need to give land time to heal. Rotating crops and animals in different pastures helps the ground stay full of nutrients and reduced damage to the land.

Basically, this underpins all of my decisions and actions.\n\nAnd then a friend of mine told me: \"If you chose to eat salad, it doesn't affect anyone. But if you chose to eat meat, an animal has to die. That choice has a victim\".\n\nIt took years until I actually aligned my actions accordingly, but that comment and the following realization did do a number on me.

Veganism is a philosophy that strives to reduce harm to and exploitation of animals as much as possible. The dietary choices then logically follow from that.", "This is the way.\n\nI *do not* respect all beliefs and religions. In fact, your beliefs and religion have to earn my respect.\n\nMisogynistic and hateful dogmas don't get any tolerance from me, simply because they're baked into your religion. \n\nYou should be scrutinizing that shit, questioning it, and rejecting it.  And if you can't extricate the misogyny and hate from the core tenets of the religion because they are built upon them, then you need a new religion.  It's 2023 AD not 200 AD, folks.\n\nI dunno where this concept of blanket religious acceptance and tolerance came from, but I find it absurd and wrong.", "Thank you. I try my best to be articulate.

You can make your own choice from the get go. If I wanted to drop everything and go nothing is really stopping me. If I wanted to turn my life around no one is stopping me. I won't allow someone to stop me. \n\nI am confused on what you mean by this. Do you feel that you do not have control in your actions for your life? Are your choices not your own?\n\n> when should our choices be subject to scrutiny or outright restricted?\n\n? People can scrutinize all they want. Everyone has an opinion. Our choices are always being judged. Whether or not we should care about their opinions are on us.\n\nThe only reason things would be restricted is if it is a criminal action otherwise. My diet has no effect in causing someone physical harm. If I threw a punch at someone, my choices would be restricted through punishments. \n\nIf all my choices are doing is hurting someone's feelings, then they need to ignore me, block me, unfriendly me etc... as feelings are not something to restrict choices over. \n\nIf I don't like being around someone, It is on me to not be around them. It is not on them to cater to my feelings. \n\nWhat is your opinion on the matter?\n\nWhat choices are you talking about that should be restricted or subject to scrutiny?", "Sure thing! \n\nhttps://sustainability-success.com/negative-effects-of-veganism-on-the-environment/", "Found the vegan", "Until you factor the huge amount of small animals killed in order to produce plant foods for people.\n\nHere's the thing - the vast majority of the almonds are grown in California, a state with major water issues.
