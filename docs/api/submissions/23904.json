She claimed it was unethical and she couldn't be around it. Fine, her choice, right? But here's where it gets spicy.\n\nShe's been pestering me (27F) and my fiance (28M) about our diet choices, trying to guilt-trip us into going vegan too. She sends us graphic videos of animal cruelty and lectures us about the environmental impact of eating meat. She even said she won't come to our house anymore if we continue eating animal products.\n\nI lost my temper and told her that she can't impose her vegan lifestyle on our family and that she's being overly dramatic.

You know the annoying new Christians always evangelizing and talking over you\u2026 \n\nTo her, she sees the cruelty and the horrible shit we do to animals. She wants to stop it and doesn\u2019t understand why everyone is doing it. You talk of imposing a diet choice, to her she hears you want to impose torture and pain and death on innocent animals. Ultimately that\u2019s what it is. You could choose a vegan burger or a burger made of someone who wanted to live and it sounds like a horrible choice\u2026 but yeah absolutely the way she\u2019s doing that tho of course isn\u2019t effective here. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s like the new believer high, caught up in her new way of seeing the world to deal individually with the person in front of her.

No. Especially threatening to cut off all contact is self-defeating and a poor strategy for social movements. It doesn\u2019t work. If she\u2019s saying you\u2019re insensitive and disrespectful to her just because you told her she can\u2019t impose that, obviously NTA. You say you lost your temper tho so sounds like you did more than just say that\u2026 for her to say you were insensitive and disrespectful to *her* suggests you said something more personal - but only you know what you said in anger. \n\nNo doubt some people will just read me saying I\u2019m vegan and downvote immediately and reply the usual silly nonsense. In reality, everything is more nuanced. \n\nHopefully your sister can find people who understand the issues and have the experience to get her through the initial stages of that \u2018new believer high\u2019.
