She claimed it was unethical and she couldn't be around it. Fine, her choice, right? But here's where it gets spicy.\n\nShe's been pestering me (27F) and my fiance (28M) about our diet choices, trying to guilt-trip us into going vegan too. She sends us graphic videos of animal cruelty and lectures us about the environmental impact of eating meat. She even said she won't come to our house anymore if we continue eating animal products.\n\nI lost my temper and told her that she can't impose her vegan lifestyle on our family and that she's being overly dramatic.

You know the annoying new Christians always evangelizing and talking over you\u2026 \n\nTo her, she sees the cruelty and the horrible shit we do to animals. She wants to stop it and doesn\u2019t understand why everyone is doing it. You talk of imposing a diet choice, to her she hears you want to impose torture and pain and death on innocent animals. Ultimately that\u2019s what it is. You could choose a vegan burger or a burger made of someone who wanted to live and it sounds like a horrible choice\u2026 but yeah absolutely the way she\u2019s doing that tho of course isn\u2019t effective here. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s like the new believer high, caught up in her new way of seeing the world to deal individually with the person in front of her.

No. Especially threatening to cut off all contact is self-defeating and a poor strategy for social movements. It doesn\u2019t work. If she\u2019s saying you\u2019re insensitive and disrespectful to her just because you told her she can\u2019t impose that, obviously NTA. You say you lost your temper tho so sounds like you did more than just say that\u2026 for her to say you were insensitive and disrespectful to *her* suggests you said something more personal - but only you know what you said in anger. \n\nNo doubt some people will just read me saying I\u2019m vegan and downvote immediately and reply the usual silly nonsense. In reality, everything is more nuanced. \n\nHopefully your sister can find people who understand the issues and have the experience to get her through the initial stages of that \u2018new believer high\u2019.

Of course any food product is hurting other species (since you need space to produce, so you destroy/take over an existing ecosystem), but meat production just requires much, much more land. The food for animals doesn't come from nowhere.\n\nYou may feel better lying to yourself or believiing that you desteoyed vegans with facts and logic, but if you can do 1 + 1 it's obvious that reducing meat consumption is clearly less harmful to the environment by a large, large margin.\n\nNTA, the sister seems pretty annoying, despite being essentially right.", "Funny thing: more wood gets burned down and animals killed, because farmland is needed to feed animals that we use (eat, milk, skin, and so on) or to stretch gasoline, than to directly feed people. \n\nThis also requires a ginormous amount of water. Way more than almond milk. \n\nIf EVERYONE would ho vegan, we would only need a tiny part of the land we currently use. \n\nThe other thing: not everyone hates vegans, because they pester others with their believes. As a non vegan, I try to limit my animal product usage a lot, but I just can not live without my quattro formagie pizza (4 cheese) and my beloved croissants (which use butter). \n\nBut I can live without milk and a lot less steak.", "You're so misinformed it's laughable.", "As much as I hate Ted Nugget he makes a good point about being a vegan being absolutely no better with what happens with farming of soy and other products", "his sister is going to marry a carrot", "You've got it all wrong! Vegans are perfect and better than everyone and were a bunch of heartless unempathetic people with no hearts /s", "You are not fully right nor fully wrong. There are a lot of negatives and positives. \n\nhttps://sustainability-success.com/negative-effects-of-veganism-on-the-environment/\n\nVegainisum does have a smaller environmental footprint but it still does lots of damage. \n\nIt has both goods and bads but becauseof the negatives like soil pollution, pollution from transportation, deforestation etc..  it isn't sustainable.", "Ambivalence means mixed feelings. The opposite of love is *apathy*.", "Ok, please tell us why? What is problematic about this to you?", "Fair enough, thanks for the correction.", "*Po-tay-toes!* Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew... Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.", "Why should the food you choose to eat not be a moral issue? Any choice, action, or belief that results in a negative outcome for another sentient being should absolutely be a moral issue. \n\nWhether you come to the same moral conclusion after that point is another issue, but disregarding ethical consideration when it comes to food is illogical and excuses plenty of abhorrent practices.", "This is the worst take I've ever heard  \n\n\n  \nWhether or not living creatures that feel pain are killed in a very unpleasant and terrifying manner, and whether you give the people who did it money to keep doing it, is an area where morality is \"neither needed nor desired\"?  \n\n\nDo you have a dog or cat, friend?"]}
