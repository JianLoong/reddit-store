I should make myself a bit more clear. My mind isnt made up, and while i love my boyfriend more than anything, there isnt anything i wouldnt do just to put a smile on his face. I love myself, and while i love being with him, i know he is controlling but we have to love the whole picture dont we? Im torn between my love for him and my want to experience the world on my own for the very first time. I want to marry him, but not this young! And if we do get married in the near future im dishonouring thr other half of me that wants to explore.\n\nI, 18(F) have been with my boyfriend 18M for over a year now. Before him i dated my ex for 2 years, and before that another girl for 3. Recently though, looking back I realised I never got to experience life on my own. If i wanted to do something they always had to be included or I had to plan my days around their schedules to best suit them. Sometimes it feels like im mothering them but oh well. I never get to hang out with my friends much, because the moment my work schedule is out my boyfriend is making plans before I can even figure out my friend's schedule to make plans with them.\n\nIve never gotten to go clubbing with just my friends, as my boyfriend insists someone will try make a move on me so he has to come to protect me, and when I went on holidays with my friends a few weeks back, that principal still followed. They went clubbing and I had to stay in the hotel on the phone with him. I know I could have jusy went, but he said he'd be uncomfortable and I didnt want to disrespect his boundaries. \n\nAnd now he's talking about marrying me and settling down \"as soon as we can\" and its made me realise if we do. Theres so much to life I wont be able to experience. Ive never had a period of time where I can go clubbing, meet a guy and nothing serious happens. Or being able to giggle about the cute guy at the coffee shop with my friends instead of just looking at my phone and pretending i dont agree. I always end up in these long term relationships when they arent necessarily what I want? The other either just decides we are dating without my input or just keeps asking till im too tired to say no. \n\nI talked with my boyfriend about this and he called me an AH and that \"you wont even like that kind of stuff anyways\" but how can I know I dont like something I may never get to experience?\n\nAm I the AH for wanting more \"experiences\" before settling down?", "created_utc": 1691828598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15oywf8/aita_for_wanting_to_experience_life_alone_before/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Massive red flags there", "NTA\n\nAnd good for you that you are considering getting out of the relationship!\nIt\u2019s not normal behaviour to limit your partner in the way your bf does with you. You can go clubbing with your girls alone- he should be able to trust you.\n\nBut I also get the sentiment that you want to experience what it is like to be single and free and your own person! As a serial relationship jumper myself I can only say\u2026 do it. Find out who you are without a partner. You don\u2019t seem to love him that much that you\u2019d really want to settle down with him. So yes! Go for it! Say goodbye for him and get yourself a couple of coffee shop crushes but also.. spend some time by yourself :)", "Dear stranger, dump that controlling loser and go live your best life with your friends. Don't look back. NTA", "Your boyfriend is an insecure controlling asshole who wants to tell you what you can and can\u2019t do on your own time. He wants to marry you so he can keep tabs on you and keep you all to himself. It will only get worse. Ditch this loser.", "Nta. Learning how to function as an adult/individual without a partner is healthy part of growing up. You should be able to place boundaries where you spend time with your friends I will say clubbing and similar things are commonly hurtle for couples.  \n\nFrom your story, your bf is showing serious red flag behavior with the control  he wants to have in your life. Something to consider is that if you just want to have independence and do things without your bf no issue,  you need to instill that boundary with him, and he needs to accept or move on. If you want to actively go to clubs and flirt/be flirted with by other people then it sounds like you need to discuss the potential of an open relationship or break up and go separate ways.", "NTA. I (30M), can totally relate where you're coming from. I've been together with my wife since we were 18. \nIn the first years I was kind of in your position. I wanted to party, hang out with friends, go on vacation and definitely didn't want to stay Saturday night at home watching a movie with her parents. We have had quite a few fights about it, but eventually she gave me the freedom I desired. That lasted until around 22 and we started to settle down after that. But if she didn't give me space then, I don't know if it would've worked out.\n\nWe're married now, own a house, have stable jobs and think about children.\n\nI can remember this urge to discover and experience the world can be really intense. Also i think it's natural for a young person and nothing to be called an AH for in any way. I think you should be really honest with your boyfriend. Tell him what you feel and what you need. He is claiming you and that is not okay. That you have to stay in the hotel on the phone with him is toxic. I guess he is doing it out of insecurity, but it's not a healthy thing. It will isolate you slowly from your friends, so you'll have to put a stop on that.\nAlso be honest to yourself because I think you already made your choice.\n\nFurthermore you should consider if you see yourself  building a life together with your boyfriend. When I read your post, I didn't read that you love him or are happy when you're with him. If you're still living with your parents a relationship is easy. When living together you got to work for it: you'll have to become more than just boyfriend and girlfriend but you'll have to become real partners to make everyday life work. \n\nIt's good to choose for yourself.

It\u2019s important as an adult that you are able to find yourself and discover who you truly are. Some people are able to do this within a relationship but it sounds like your relationship is not that space and may not allow you to truly grow and thrive as a human. My advice would be to not settle down so young, there is so much to experience out there, go and travel, have fun, find your passions", "This is not the person for you. He's insecure and controlling, and he's only gonna get worse. You're just 18. There's so much living for you to do. Don't settle for your jailer (that's what he is).\n\nIn healthy relationships, people still have time for other aspects of their lives and for other people in their lives. You should be able to hang out with your friends or go clubbing and whatever without it turning into world war 3. What he's doing is not him communicating his boundaries. That's just him imposing his insecurities on you and being a controlling a-hole. This is a toxic relationship. Not at all healthy. \n\n\nPlease break up with him. Then take a break from dating for like a year or two. Take that time to grow, explore and figure out what you want in a relationship and the kind of person that you want it with. Practice saying no and sticking to that no, no matter the pressure put on you. So that the next time you get into a relationship, you are able to set your boundaries right from the start, can spot redflags a mile away and avoid insecure a-holes.

If this is what you want, your goals are basically opposites and you should both just go in your separate directions to pursue what you want without each other.", "NTA. Plus, your bf is controlling. You don't want to marry somebody who controls what you do because he is uncomfortable. I think you are right, you need to spend some time by yourself, understand who you are, and take steps to become able to assert your boundaries.

As long as she doesn't drag me to too many social events, she's free to go wherever she wants.", "NTA - going out to a club with your friends when on holiday is NOT disrespecting his boundaries.  \nIt is you letting him control you.  \nYou definitely need time alone out of a relationship.  \nYou desperately need time away from this controlling red flag.   \nHe will only get worse, next you won\u2019t be allowed to see your friends at all", "NTA. Stop caving in to others and do what you want. Learning how to say no to others is a vital life skill that you need to work on.", "In reply to your edit: a partner being controlling isn\u2019t ever something you should make yourself love. You are seeing red flags. Love feels important, but it isn\u2019t worth putting up with this.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m speaking from experience.

Make the break as amicable as possible and move on. \n\nYou are setting both of you up for many years of unhappiness if you give up on your desire to experience life and settle down with someone just because you have dated for a couple of years.", "ESH. You seem to want to flirt, or have sex with other guys. He won't even allow you to go anywhere that might have other guys without him.

It won't be your fault that it doesn't work, it was never meant to. What will be your fault is if you know this and keep going with the relationship, ignoring your gut instinct, and bring children into that relationship too.", "She \"chooses\" not to do them because he manipulates her. She's in love with him and doesn't want to make him feel \" uncomfortable\", setting her own wishes aside. This is no free choice."]}
