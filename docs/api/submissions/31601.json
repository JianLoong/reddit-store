We have been together for over five years, own a home together, have two dogs, and live a happy life. We have had a rocky relationship at times though, and are definitely not perfect. He is the oldest of two brothers and sometimes when we get playful, he will take it just a tad too far and maybe he may push me a little to hard or tickle me until I'm frustrated, things like that. \n\nAs we started planning our wedding, he off the bat talked about how excited he was to put cake in my face. I was little apprehensive about this, but he seemed so excited, I'm not having makeup professionally done, and I figured it is just one moment of the day so I said sure. As time has gone on I have seen the TikTok tragedies over cake in face at weddings, and I began to get worried. With the way he is, I'm worried he will take it a little to far. \n\nWhen I started to feel this way I talked to him and told him I would want to practice before hand, to which he seemed a little frustrated about but said sure he understood. He promised he wouldn't get it in my hair or on my dress, but really how can you control that?\n\nI have kept trying to get him to practice, and he never wants to. He will do it without the cake, but never wants to with cake or whipped cream because \"he doesn't want to be sticky\". (like I would be a the wedding right?) Anyways, every time we do it without the cake, I sware he will touch my hair to which I call him out on.\n\nToday was thanksgiving. He started talking about this with my dad and I mentioned I really didn't want to do it unless we practiced. Once again he did it without anything, and touched my hair. I called him out and my dad said \"we have whipped cream, why not try it\". So I said sure. I said please be careful, don't get it in my hair or on my clothes. (Once again it it thanksgiving) I showed him where I was okay with it going on my face and he went to do it. He put way too much on and I told him, \"see even that was too much\". And then he smashed the rest in my face. I guess I moved and it got all over my hair, eyebrows, and some on my clothes. \n\nI immediately started crying and ran to the bathroom. He came in and apologized and cleaned me up and said, \"I'm sorry, you just moved and I got it on you\". He was really nice and cleaned me up, but it just frustrated me and I said we were absolutely not doing it at the wedding because if he couldn't control himself now, he wouldn't at our wedding. I was upset for like 30 more minutes and he said, \"I understand if you don't want to anymore, I just want you happy\". \n\nI said we will see but IF we do it we have to practice properly.... Not on a freaking family holiday. As of right now though, my answer is a hard no.

Your wedding is supposed to be the happiest moment of your life, not a moment to be humiliated.\n\nIf he's so desperate to smash your face into a cake (which is really weird as far as I'm concerned), then you can do it on the honeymoon when you're in a relaxed environment, not surrounded by people or dressed in formal clothing. \n\nBut above all else, tell him very firmly that this isn't going to happen at the wedding, and any attempts to do so despite your protests will result in a crying bride and a ruined wedding, and everyone from you to the guests being angry with his immaturity.", "NTA.

My mother told me that on their wedding day she explicitly told my dad not to do it.", "Western nothing, is misogyny.", "Most people smash a bite or two at most on their partner's face - they really just smear a small piece around", "Right?! He keeps pushing boundaries to see how far he can go with her. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually it leads to full on physical abuse.", "There's the thing, it's a \"trend\", not a \"tradition\".  I'd never even heard of it outside of AITA threads.  But then even things that are actual traditions aren't mandatory - if either of the people getting married don't want something at their wedding or are uncomfortable with something, that should be the end of it.  We didn't exchange rings because neither of us wear jewellery.  The registrar looked slightly perplexed but NOBODY DIED.", "This, this, THIS. The comment about him regularly violating her boundaries got to me. Like, bro, he knows it's wrong. He does that shit anyway. Even that comment about him not wanting to do the cakesmashing thing any more reeks of manipulation. OP has already expressed discomfort about it before and he's refused to listen. \n\nI honestly hope that OP wakes up and at least puts the wedding on hold.", "It's not that recent. I remember weddings back in the mid 80's.  My ex and I thought it was stupid and promised we wouldn't do it.", "Cake smashing at weddings is definitely not a very recent phenomenon. \n\nIt\u2019s been going on for years.

Soon as it's the two of them he'll be pressuring her again.", "She's already allowed him to convince her that he doesn't mean it.  \"Sometimes he goes just a tad too far,\" don't you know.  He's probably got her believing it's her fault when it happens, too, just like he did with the whipped cream incident.", "I know,  I find it so frustrating just how many people post about their partners treating them so badly and so many seem willing to put up with it. I know it's not easy when you may be in a marriage or living with someone who turns into a Jekyll and Hyde but it can be done. I dont know what the answer is, perhaps teach self esteem classes at school!!", "My niece married into a family that has a tradition of shoving someone\u2019s face into a cake. Typically at birthdays, but occasionally other events too. It\u2019s weird AF IMO, but apparently it\u2019s a cultural thing? \n\nAnyway, there as an event this summer with a gorgeous cake and of course, part of the family wanted to shove someone into the cake and it had dowels in it. A fight broke out because someone stopped the cake smash. You know, to prevent someone from losing an eye. \n\nSuch a dumb tradition IMO", "If she really is fine with it, it might be a cute compromise to do something like dipping the index finger in the cream/frosting/whatever and swipe it over the cheek or nose. Basically just painting a little line with it. It's more like a sweet gesture than the whole cake smashing drama. But it's save regards to hidden structures and mostly about getting cake somewhere it shouldn't be, too.", "best suggestion on here!", "Just awful.

It's the full on, face first, food wasting stuff that isn't. \n\n\\*Kinda/kind of = a little cute. \n\nPlus, the person I responded to said\n\n>Cake smashing is only fun when both parties want to do it. \n\nWhich is the same thing I said, but differently.", "Yes it\u2019s very much an American thing!!!!", "Exactly. I've never seen it and would be horrified to.", "It\u2019s not usual in Australia either", "I've only heard under a handful of times about smearing a small drop of the cream on the nose tip. \n\nBut that's it.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re being downvoted, that\u2019s exactly how the \u201ccake smash\u201d should be. It\u2019s supposed to be a playful action that might mess up your lipstick a bit, but absolutely shouldn\u2019t be getting in your hair or all over your clothes.  I have no idea why anyone would do it that aggressively to someone they love anyway.", "I got married in the early 90s and remember making sure my husband (then-fiance) knew I'd divorce him immediately if he put cake on my face. I really couldn't image he'd want to anyway, and indeed he thought it would be extremely declasse. Anway, I can confirm it's been around longer than 20 years. It might have been smooshing a slice all over someone's face and not shoving them into the whole cake, though--not sure about the specifics.", "I thought back then it was both parties smashing cake into each other's faces? Like a \"who can get who first\" thing?", "Is this in the USA been too many weddings over the years and never seen it once here in the UK. In fact over here the couple pose cutting the cake for a cheer and photos then it goes off to be sliced and plated to hand out. The whole feeding each other cake thing seems to be from the other side of the pond as well.", "The \"I guess I moved\" statement sounds like there might be (actual, literal, properly-defined) gaslighting going on in the relationship too. I'm a survivor of real gaslighting and when I read that line combined with how she's obviously forcing herself to go along with something she *really* doesn't want to do for this clown who's dead-set on humiliating her on the happiest day of her life for some reason, it made me nauseous. :(", "It's not part of any culture. It's crude and aggressive. Note how it's usually the man doing it to the woman? So on second thought maybe a male culture that values dominating women by publically humiliating them at a time they're looking elegant?", "It\u2019s more about his loss of control rather than who gets messy, this whole post feels more like control than fun with cake.", "I know this sub can be extremely black and white but there is a lot in OP's post that should give her pause before she decides to continue with this wedding.", "Pretty sure this version (La Mordida) started as a Mexican tradition, but of course this traditional has spread around the Americas. There's also a version where both the groom and bride both do it to each other, but that doesn't seem to be what's being proposed here.", "I've never seen it done anywhere other than in a cruel youtube video.  Let it die.", "Makes me wonder if this is an ownership/ dominance thing like now you are mine and I can what I like to you and I am the boss. Almost all abusive relationships start off as romantic and wonderful until they see you as \u201ccaught\u201d then they start the control and abuse.

You know the fella wasn't bothered to keep it respectful - that's why he's so excited. He will totally lose control, he wants to humiliate OP for some reason. \n\nAlso, if OP turned it around on him and said \"and I'm going to smash one in your face back\" I bet husband to be wouldn't be so enthralled with the idea. \n\nOP seems to be trying to persuade herself into something she is truly not happy with, and for some reason the fact the fianc\u00e9 is so excited about this and ignoring OP's very reasonable concerns is making me feel very uneasy. \n\nThere is something else going on here.", "It\u2019s supposed to be after the first cut and the couple is feeding each other the first bite of cake at the same time.
