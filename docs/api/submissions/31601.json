We have been together for over five years, own a home together, have two dogs, and live a happy life. We have had a rocky relationship at times though, and are definitely not perfect. He is the oldest of two brothers and sometimes when we get playful, he will take it just a tad too far and maybe he may push me a little to hard or tickle me until I'm frustrated, things like that. \n\nAs we started planning our wedding, he off the bat talked about how excited he was to put cake in my face. I was little apprehensive about this, but he seemed so excited, I'm not having makeup professionally done, and I figured it is just one moment of the day so I said sure. As time has gone on I have seen the TikTok tragedies over cake in face at weddings, and I began to get worried. With the way he is, I'm worried he will take it a little to far. \n\nWhen I started to feel this way I talked to him and told him I would want to practice before hand, to which he seemed a little frustrated about but said sure he understood. He promised he wouldn't get it in my hair or on my dress, but really how can you control that?\n\nI have kept trying to get him to practice, and he never wants to. He will do it without the cake, but never wants to with cake or whipped cream because \"he doesn't want to be sticky\". (like I would be a the wedding right?) Anyways, every time we do it without the cake, I sware he will touch my hair to which I call him out on.\n\nToday was thanksgiving. He started talking about this with my dad and I mentioned I really didn't want to do it unless we practiced. Once again he did it without anything, and touched my hair. I called him out and my dad said \"we have whipped cream, why not try it\". So I said sure. I said please be careful, don't get it in my hair or on my clothes. (Once again it it thanksgiving) I showed him where I was okay with it going on my face and he went to do it. He put way too much on and I told him, \"see even that was too much\". And then he smashed the rest in my face. I guess I moved and it got all over my hair, eyebrows, and some on my clothes. \n\nI immediately started crying and ran to the bathroom. He came in and apologized and cleaned me up and said, \"I'm sorry, you just moved and I got it on you\". He was really nice and cleaned me up, but it just frustrated me and I said we were absolutely not doing it at the wedding because if he couldn't control himself now, he wouldn't at our wedding. I was upset for like 30 more minutes and he said, \"I understand if you don't want to anymore, I just want you happy\". \n\nI said we will see but IF we do it we have to practice properly.... Not on a freaking family holiday. As of right now though, my answer is a hard no.

Your wedding is supposed to be the happiest moment of your life, not a moment to be humiliated.\n\nIf he's so desperate to smash your face into a cake (which is really weird as far as I'm concerned), then you can do it on the honeymoon when you're in a relaxed environment, not surrounded by people or dressed in formal clothing. \n\nBut above all else, tell him very firmly that this isn't going to happen at the wedding, and any attempts to do so despite your protests will result in a crying bride and a ruined wedding, and everyone from you to the guests being angry with his immaturity.", "NTA.

If you're uncomfortable with it, he shouldn't do it at all (otherwise it's just about him being able to do something to your body against your will...think about what that implies).
