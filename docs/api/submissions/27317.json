You can\u2019t rightfully punish a person for the actions of another person. People aren\u2019t always like their parents. This kid deserves a chance at some type of normalcy. Hate the rest of them all you want.", "It's amazing how many people don't get the picture that when they get blocked on social media it means the person blocking them wants nothing to do with them. ESPECIALLY when it's a person they've never met before!\n\nNTA, OP. This woman needs to wake up to reality.", "She likely have little or no support structure, so she's looking for those close family connections (aka: it boils down to babysitting for young kids).", "Some impressive mental gymnastics here to turn this on the person being harassed. What an asshole comment.", "This kid has absolutely no relation to OP whatsoever.", "Good call - I hadn't thought that deadbeat may not have legally married this woman.", "You're smart!", "Even if you're right, it doesn't mean the woman knows that", "True mindset of someone who doesn't respect other's boundaries.", "Or of someone with the utmost respect for other's boundaries who wouldn't want my family members' boundaries disrespected as a result of my personal issues.\n\nPersonally, I like to minimize risk and harm to my family members. Wasn't expecting that to be such a controversial take, which is kind of sad.", "and what if this is the only way to stop this woman bothering him and his family? I don't think op should waste their time fighting to claim anything from someone they never knew my view is simply have a third party aka a lawyer confirm the real motive if there is one and have them deal with her by send a letter along with the cease and deist they already want to send which atleast where i live would require getting a lawyer anyway so just get the lawyer you are already paying for to do 2-3 things instead of just one.", "Maybe you should look at why nobody agrees with you instead of acting like a martyr.", "The original post is a bit light on connective tissue, so we don't know how this went down.  Thus the info post. But it's possible from the text that it's something like:\n\n1. Crazy person declares determination to contact OP\n2. OP ignores problem and hopes it goes away\n3. Crazy person escalates contact attempts on other social media venues\n4. OP ignores problem and hopes it goes away\n5. Crazy person tries to get to OP through their mother\n6. OP ignores problem and hopes it goes away\n7. Crazy person turns to OP's younger, minor siblings. It gets bad enough that younger siblings' life is actually disrupted\n8. OP finally does something to address it\n\nWe also don't have any sense of timeframe. For all we know, this lady was harassing family members for almost a year before OP did anything. It's possible OP took action earlier and it didn't work. It's possible OP talked through a gameplan with their mother and it just didn't pan out. OP could be entirely in the clear. But we don't know that from the post.\n\nIs that what happened?  Probably not? I hope not? But if it is, then OP ignored the issues impacting them until they actually damaged the quality of life of a group of kids OP cares about. Again, might not be what happened. Which was the point of the INFO.\n\nAs for the lack of agreement, well...anyone who thinks the above worst-case scenario is okay has a very limited and Randian view of personal responsibility, which is a trend pretty widely acknowledged in this sub."]}
