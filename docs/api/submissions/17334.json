But you didn't want to do that, and I can guess why: you knew that Ann actually participated in the project, and you suspected that the other group members (and possibly the professor) would believe that she was ill and give her a pass on the part she missed, so you wouldn't be able to fully \"punish\" her for her prior behavior \n\nYTA for going behind people's backs to manipulate the situation", "You are such a YTA.

It's infuriating to have someone hinder your work and benefit from your efforts. That being said you actively went out of your way to make sure she failed without bringing it up to her or talking about your grievances with her first.

You sabotaged her ability to at least try to complete the assignment. My guess is that you just don't like her. You could've helped her out with her portion of all the group work you did with her over the entire semester, including the final, but you let her turn in inferior work time and time again and just cleaned it up for her instead. That's not help, btw. Helping her would've been sitting down with her and explaining things she doesn't understand, helping her with spelling and grammar, etc. It seems like the whole group was unwilling to help her out as well.

Second, her lack of quality work previously has nothing to do with what happened in the most recent group, so your justifications don\u2019t even make sense.

But she really did deserve the fail at the end since most of her work from that course I had done and it wasn\u2019t really her. I now realize that the way I reacted was shady and wrong, and I\u2019ll approach a similar situation in the future more carefully, but I also hope that Ann learns from what happened to her too, and that she needs to work and get grades she deserves, she might get put in similar situations in the future and I hope she remembers this and that not everyone\u2019s going to be nice with her and learn from it.

If you really wanted to stand up for yourself you should have told her you were taking her name off the project & would no longer allow her to have access", "ESH It's not fair for her to mooch off of you, but the right thing to do would've been to discuss this with the instructor and ask not to be grouped with her when you found out it was a group assignment or to discuss this with her and with your group before you started working on it and when she didnt show up. Use your words to stand up for yourself instead of playing petty tricks", "YTA. Talk to your professor.", "Listen, I've been in your place. I was beyond frustrated with people who simply don't contribute to group projects. I can understand not wanting to confront people, but giving her the wrong assignment and hiding what you did from other teammates was plain wrong. The easiest solution was to confide in your professor that she doesn't contribute. Nothing else needed to be done - you didn't need to bring it up with your teammates, you didn't need to tell her to contribute more, you didn't need to share a fake assignment. I relate to your frustration but YTA", "YTA. If Ann is paying for college she has grounds to sue the OP for any additional cost her failing the class incurred.

And I'll refuse to give points to kids just cause they have a name on a project.", "Most teachers and professors dgaf they say that if someone doesn\u2019t do their share let them know but they do nothing about it or say figure it out among yourselves. I\u2019ve been in op shoes and I understand where they\u2019re coming from (I\u2019m an older student) I refuse to let anyone get credit or give them notes if they don\u2019t bother to show up for class or not participate in the assignment.  \nso what if other student know what op did, going forward they know op won\u2019t take them doing no work and expect to get full credit for it.. if the others want to be suckers and helped this lazy student that\u2019s on them.. they can do that next time if they are unfortunate enough to have another class with her.", "All of this. \n\nPlus OP your experience in a group collaboration closely mimics how it is in the real world. Sometimes you do more work than others in the group.

The only thing you should have done is speak to your instructor about being down a member", "Oh yeah I mean you are an asshole but only because you didn\u2019t bring the other two in and ask them in my opinion. It made you look a bit bad, but dude people who don\u2019t do shit for a group project are the WORST", "This is what I would have done. I'm not the mediator I'm not the instructor this isn't my course but it is my grade so the most I would've done is speak to the instructor beforehand. Express your concerns and if the result was the same (that she didn't contribute) go to the instructor with proof and she'll handle it on the other student's end of accountability.", "Tbf, teachers do usually require some type of doctor's note if you're asking for extra time or to be excused from a project or etc. That being said, you definitely don't have to give the details of why you were in the hospital, just you have to prove you were. But regardless of that, the teacher should never have discussed whether she was out wasn't in the hospital with another person, especially with another student. That seems like a huge breach of privacy and could get them in trouble.", "If she doesn't want to show her paperwork or whatever, showing she was in the hospital, then I believe at the very least, a doctor's note is required. At least when you work someplace, that's how it works.", "Yeah, i can't imagine a professor (im assuming college, but who knows) would NEVER discuss the discipline of anothed student, their grades, or work ethic with another student in the class.

She may have chronic health issues.", "Idk how old OP is but I never had a college professor ask for proof of anything, they always just trusted us to handle our shit and be honest if we needed extra time or help. Either way OP should have just spoken to their instructor and let them handle it for sure", "I\u2019ve never had a job or a professor that didn\u2019t just trust us.

Maybe they wanted this person in their debt.  \n\nThis is coming from someone who has both organized a lot of group projects and done a lot of group projects.  I've been in your shoes and your teachers shoes and it sucks when someone won't contribute to a group project from both sides.

And with shared documents / recorded Zoom calls / etc., this is pretty easy to evidence now, if the professor wants some sort of proof as to who did what.", "This is a good point about it being unfair to give Ann credit for work she didn't do. But pretending and hiding it from her was the problem. Your suggestion about going to the professor was the best one I've seen. \"Dear Prof. Ann did not work on this project with us. She claims she was in the hospital. I feel like we can't include her name on the document. I'm CCing her so that you and she can talk about an alternate assignment. Thanks! OP\" Easy email to send.", "I\u2019m with you lol", "But they contributed just as much as you and they didn\u2019t want to remove her name from the project they contributed to. \n\nSo you acted for them without their permission?", "If Ann has a valid excuse she should have taken in to the teacher and let them decide the consequences.\nAnn didn't do any work so she deserves 0 credit.\n\n\nNTA and don't let internet slackers tell you otherwise.", "Hopefully Ann can prove she was sick and the others in the group will report you to the professor for bullying. \n\nYou could have publicly removed her by emailing the group and the professor.", "Did you also tell the instructor that you purposely deleted important information and sent Ann the wrong assignment? Because I have a hard time believing that ANY instructor would support that.", "You should put that on your text!", "You should have left it at speaking with the professor. And a peer eval.\n\nI once became gravely ill the day a group assignment was due. I was not present when the paper was turned in. Afterwards, Jill told me that Nancy had tried to convince everyone in my group  to tell the professor that I had contributed nothing and to take my name off the assignment.\n\nI did more than my fair share. Nancy was a liar. Funny part is I had to correct 80% of her work.\n\nGuess what? Everyone in the group shunned Nancy after that. She showed her true colors. Backstabbing, for no reason.\n\nAlternatively, I had a group one with three other people. One girl, Gretchen, never came to one meeting on campus or off campus. She had millions of excuses. She contributed two sentences to the entire assignment. We even scheduled the final project meeting around her schedule. We all met up to print and bind everything - no Gretchen. For hours, she didn\u2019t even message us back.\n\nwe each had a chance to evaluate our peers. We gave her a bad grade in power evaluation. I spoke to the professor during office goes and explained. She said she would speak to Gretchen herself.\n\nFor all you know, this girl\u2019s mom could have died and she didn\u2019t want to share that. Yes, the grades should be fair, but leave that to the professor. Try to give people some more benefit of doubt.\n\nAlso - all this has done is make you look super bad.", "The instructor wasn\u2019t on your side. By your own admission, Ann did do some work on earlier portions of the project. Your instructor quite obviously was telling you you absolutely shouldn\u2019t have taken another student\u2019s academic performance into your own hands.", "She doesn\u2019t have to if this is in the US. The Dean of Students\u2019 office usually handles this and the professor never knows the whole story. They\u2019re told \u201cqualifying excuse per the handbook\u201d basically and that\u2019s it.", "This is such a fucking lie, every comment you have about your professor is either so obviously made up or or prof needs to be fired.", "I just can't fathom putting a group grade like that on a bunch of college kids. If a credit is $1000 then I'm risking $3k minimum on a single credit. Maybe more--a scholarship or grant. Etc. Kids fail my course all the time--cause of them, not a group. \n\nI also can't fathom putting such a huge weight on one assignment, let alone a group project like that.", "As a professor, I wouldn\u2019t punish OP if I was able to determine that the other student did no work. If they didn\u2019t contribute to the assignment, they don\u2019t get any credit for it.", "Dealing with adults it's a bit different and when I taught college I wouldn't make group projects worth that much. I had a friend almost not graduate undergrad for a group project like this. \n\nWhat OP did is fucked up but I have also dealt with students like he described and conflict is hard. So I think I'd circumvent the problem so I don't have to deal with it, truthfully... When you put people in positions like that where ONE assignment is worth 24% of a grade, it will bring out the worst in people. Knowing how this shit goes as a teacher, that's my answer cause it's not black and white.", "Haven't you been on AITA before?  Everyone is 100% sure about the parts they make up.", "OP absolutely should have discussed with the other group members during the multi-hour zoom. Heck, the best part of group projects when the flakey member has bailed on the meeting is to complain about how they've done this before.", "Your argument is not that he casted stones but didn't cast stones as a group? Interesting lol", "I wouldn\u2019t trust what the OP says about their professors reaction at all. The OP is a weasel and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they were using that line to curry favor with the posters in this thread.", "I don't know about OPs school, but my university professors would ask for a note from the doctor when we had to skip classes or to deliver something past the due date!", "Even if they unilaterally made the decision, without your or the group\u2019s input? That\u2019s crazy and very unprofessional.", "I don\u2019t disagree with you re: your concerns and dislike for group projects. As a student and when I taught undergrads, I preferred independent assignments.\n\nI would have been open to hearing OP\u2019s concerns. I would not have responded well to their unilateral decisions. If the professor had concerns about that particular student, they should have intervened earlier.", "Are you sure about that?", "Either Ann gets credit or she doesn\u2019t. That means there is one stone to cast or not cast. OP took it upon himself to decide for the entire group that the stone should be cast.", "Oof, that\u2019s not cool. Adults who are paying to be there don\u2019t need to explain why they aren\u2019t there. Thankfully neither my undergrad nor graduate schools ever had a culture like that", "There\u2019s a huge push in education today for grades to 100% reflect content knowledge, and not behavior. That\u2019s why many teachers aren\u2019t allowed to take points off for late work or lack of participation anymore. I doubt the professor could do anything about it anyway. They\u2019re not allowed to grade OP on professional behavior.", "I wouldn\u2019t ever do that myself if I was working on the project, and I agree that it\u2019s unprofessional.", "I think the biggest problem here is a core educational problem of continually placing communication skills as byproducts rather than goals. I say that because I was going to say, \"They need the communication skills for the workforce,\" but unless it's a communication course, then it shouldn't be graded because it clearly wasn't taught...", "Oh, so you're siding with whoever were all mad at?", "Then she needs to work that out with a professor.  It\u2019s against the Academic Code of Conduct to put your  name in work you didn\u2019t do.  If she\u2019s that sick then she need to talk with the department, not try and wiggle her way in on everyone else\u2019s work.", "The vast majority of people I know with chronic health conditions own them at some level, particularly when it\u2019s the difference between being somewhere and not.   \n\n\nA vague \u201cI was unwell and went to the hospital\u201d isn\u2019t owning it, saying \u201cI\u201dm sorry, I have a medical condition and it flared, I needed to see the hospital about pain relief/for help\u201d is more likely (because people with chronic health conditions learn that the apology has to be sincere sounding), and even more likely is \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have IBS and it flared yesterday, it meant that I was crippled with pain and had to go to the hospital for help\u201d\u2026 because you know\u2026 sincerity.", "You do realize the group doesn't decide right? I'm pretty sure that wasn't the end of it. I am sure Ann went to the professor and argued for her side. \n1. What Ann was attempting to do is called plagiarism which is a violation of all school the ethical conducts. \n2. If she was ill enough to go to the hospital she would have been able to provide some form of document that could get her an extended due date or a different way to make up her grade. \n3. Ultimately if she didn't argue for her side to the professor then we all know she was lying. \nOP doesn't decide what the professor ultimately decides the best course of action.", "Yeah idk what school or where you work but I had to submit doctor's notes for tests and projects if I was sick as well and I graduated fall 2019.", "I think it's cultural! Because all of the universities here in Brazil have similar rules! \nWe have to have 75% attendance, and if we don't, we have to justify it. Otherwise, we fail!", "It's not a terrible way to live. People call in sick all the time when they're not really sick. Depending on the type of business, that can really affect your place of employment. A requirement for a doctor's note helps prevent people from pretending to be sick. Like I said, you don't need to prove why, or what was wrong with you, Just that you were actually seen.", "I don't know where you live, but here in Michigan it's a requirement for a doctor's note. You don't have to prove why you were there, you just need proof you were actually seen. Anyone can claim a sick day. Oh I'm sick, I can't come in today. Yep, here you can actually get fired if you can't provide proof.", "Not in my experience at all. I don\u2019t accept late work. I do t do participation points, though. Not everyone is an extravert.", "It\u2019s unprofessional if you ignored a situation where a student made unilateral decisions about another kid in the class. The appropriate recourse would be for the student with a concern to approach the teacher or professor.\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t approach you though, because you like to be obtuse for fun.", "I\u2019m not sure. I am 100% not sure about what I am sure about.", "Plus if she was sick and the others in the group disagree with OP then this girl can accuse OP of toxic behaviour and her grade removed", "as someone who is deaf with chronic health conditions - \n\ni get accommodations from my uni including extensions, assistive technology, notetakers, etc. but those accommodations do NOT apply for assessments involving group work. i cannot use any of my accommodations for assessments involving group work. it makes it extremely challenging for me, as one of me disabilities makes it challenging and painful for me to type and doing any kind of group work or discussion is very challenging for someone who is deaf. i otherwise average HD on all other assessments, but i sometimes under perform on group work because i cant use accommodations and my group is not always understanding. \n\nsome unis are very, very unforgiving when it comes to stuff like this and it isn't always up to the professors or unit convenors. often they have to defer to their faculty/the university's decision. \n\ni think there is a problem in how these things work. it isn't fair that the group should have to do the job of accessibility units at universities, but accessibility units at many unis are underfunded and underresourced and staff at universities don't get enough training in that particular area. \n\nthat said, i kind of agree with op that she was probably full of shit. i doubt most people in similar circumstances look forward to group work, considering it strips us of the supports we need to succeed at university.", "OP decided to remove her name and send her the wrong document. OP did not consult the group.\n\nOP cast a stone without asking the group if they were okay with that.", "I\u2019m just thinking there are plenty of cases where someone is too sick to go to work or school but not sick enough to go to the hospital or urgent care or primary care. Not everyone can afford to see a doctor every time they get a normal sickness. It seems inconsiderate of people without health insurance or people with high deductibles", "So you have to spend money to go to a doctor just to get a doctors note? You can easily be too sick to work but not sick enough to warrant a trip to the hospital or doctors. You can be sick enough that you are contagious and just need a couple days. Asking people to spend money to see a doctor just to take a day or two to recover is mean. I\u2019ve never made my employees do that. I trust them and they always have my back and do their jobs because of it", "That\u2019s so fucked up lmao. My sick days are my sick days, if I use them all up that\u2019s on me. Grown adults should trust each other. Also, it takes money to go to the doctor. Just because I\u2019m sick doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m so deadly sick that I need to go to the doctor. Sometimes I just need to stay home and recover, but now I have to spend money to go to a doctor just to get a doctors note that I can call out of work? Doesn\u2019t seem practical", "Some classes are just easier to grade using at least partially participation, like PE. However, you are lucky you\u2019re able to not accept late work. I\u2019ve worked at schools where no one has a deadline but the teacher, because the kids all just turn everything in the day before the grading period ends. It sucks!", "Again your argument is that he casted a stone alone but not as a group. Therefore he is wrong", "Yeah. Welcome to USA. It is what it is. I would take tests with a cold quite a bit. I would also sometimes study while sick and wait to take medicine or get better because I didn't have the time to be sick between school and my part time job.", "Also most people don't know this, but a lot of schools give heath insurance and have doctors you can visit on campus and they will give the note and prescription one needs. I found out my senior year and was like Fuck me", "At my office, if we use just one or two sick days at a time, no note is needed. If we need to be out for longer than that (or want to work remotely for an extended period of time), then a doctor's note is needed.", "I teach college. I\u2019m pretty sure this post was about college", "Sure, but trends in education can reach to all levels in a lot of cases."]}
