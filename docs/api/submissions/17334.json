Unfortunately once the teams were announced I ended up with her in a group again (I think because our names are close alphabetically) but I was fine with it since the other 2 were smart students. When time came for us to start working on this assignment, I noticed that she always responded to the group chat and I was happy with her contribution, until the day we worked on it came, I sent a zoom link for all group members to join so we could start and finish our assignment that day, it was a short but really complicated assignment. But this time Ann didn\u2019t respond to anything despite the fact that she agreed the day prior to the timing we picked, she didn\u2019t join any second of the meeting. When we finished the assignment, which took us around 5-6 consecutive hours, we created a cover page and included all the names, including Ann\u2019s, but after we left the meeting, I removed Ann\u2019s name and waited till everyone in my group submitted it to completely delete the document. Around that same time Ann messaged the group chat saying she was feeling a bit sick and went to the hospital, my other team members told her it\u2019s fine and assumed she still had access to the document.

Actually people were surprised with what I did since it really isn\u2019t like me and I\u2019m usually a shy people pleaser, even my friends that I told the story to said that. But I\u2019ve been taken advantage of many times, especially academically and I always gave in and and took on all the weight myself. I\u2019m really bad in standing up for myself, since I rarely do it and the way I handled this situation proofs it. Since I rarely do it, I went hard this time and didn\u2019t notice the extent until I read everyone\u2019s judgements on here. I genuinely thought I wasn\u2019t the asshole but now I\u2019m viewing it in a completely different way.

There may have been a solution that didn't include underhanded, lying submissions.\n\nYou have ruined your reputation with everyone that knows.  Who will want to work with you going forward?", "Of course YTA  You should have at least checked with the other group members..  Instead you played God.", "\"I made changes to a group assignment behind the backs of the other 2 group members so I could punish the 3rd member. I then refused to acknowledge what I had done and lied to Ann and intentionally sent her the wrong document, hoping she wouldn't realize. So even though she participated in the early part of the project, and even though she might have legitimately been able to get an incomplete on the project (based on whether she was able to demonstrate to the professor that she was actually sick or not), I was hoping to cause her to fail.\"\n\nA good rule of thumb in life is that if you are not willing to be up front about the actions you are taking, you are probably being an AH.\n\nAre you an AH for not letting Ann get credit for work she didn't do? No. And if you had made that case to the other group members and to your professor, I would have had no objection to your actions. But you didn't want to do that, and I can guess why: you knew that Ann actually participated in the project, and you suspected that the other group members (and possibly the professor) would believe that she was ill and give her a pass on the part she missed, so you wouldn't be able to fully \"punish\" her for her prior behavior \n\nYTA for going behind people's backs to manipulate the situation", "You are such a YTA. So disgusting and loathsome to do that deliberately to another person.\n\nIn fact, I got so wound up about it, I immediately began to suspect this was fake. A post causing an extreme reaction is often a pretty indication it was simply posted to provoke people.\n\nBut if it is real, YTA.", "YTA.  Secretly sabotaging a group member, nasty.  The adult approach would have been raising it directly with that particular group member and then the rest of the team.  It\u2019s meant to be teamwork for a reason; so that each can learn to effectively produce within a team dynamic.  You acted unilaterally.  You  failed the assignment.", "Yea I think YTA- So I completely understand your frustration working with someone who doesn't contribute the same amount of work as you. It's infuriating to have someone hinder your work and benefit from your efforts. That being said you actively went out of your way to make sure she failed without bringing it up to her or talking about your grievances with her first. You should have spoken to her about it rather than just sabotaging her on purpose. It's one thing to let people fail on their own, it's another to be a key player in that failure and that makes you an AH", "YTA for the secretive and shady way you did it.", "YTA. You sabotaged her ability to at least try to complete the assignment. My guess is that you just don't like her. You could've helped her out with her portion of all the group work you did with her over the entire semester, including the final, but you let her turn in inferior work time and time again and just cleaned it up for her instead. That's not help, btw. Helping her would've been sitting down with her and explaining things she doesn't understand, helping her with spelling and grammar, etc. It seems like the whole group was unwilling to help her out as well. Some people need a little help with their assignments, but you guys let her flounder and then *you* sabotaged her grade.", "YTA. Being part of a group of here implies democratic decision-making. You have no right to change anything in the document without the consent of everyone else in your team. You could have discussed what you felt with your team including her, and brought up your previous experiences so everybody can hold her accountable for her work. Instead, you took away her chance to contribute AND to learn. Worse still, you sabotaged her grades as well. Not cool.", "YTA. You should have talked to her first about what was bothering you, so she would have had time to improve herself. Additionally, it's a group project, and whenever decisions like these are being made, all members should have been included.", "ESH except the two group members who contributed and included all names on the project.\n\nAnn for seemingly expecting to coast through on a group project. If she was unwell, she should have told you. If she wasn\u2019t, bonus AH points for saying she was.\n\nYou for deciding this on your own and doing it behind the others\u2019 backs. And sending her a dummy assignment instead of being upfront about her contribution (or lack thereof).", "Yta\n\nYou wouldn't be the AH if you hadn't removed her name in secret and sent her a false project. You should have talked it through with the group, of course that leaves the option that they just secretly remove *your* name instead.

However, first, there are multiple avenues for a resolution you apparently didn\u2019t take, including addressing your concerns with your group member or your professor. Second, her lack of quality work previously has nothing to do with what happened in the most recent group, so your justifications don\u2019t even make sense. Lastly, it kinda seems you know all of this because you not only purposefully sabotaged her, you clearly waited until it would be hidden from your other group members, which I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d do if you weren\u2019t aware they\u2019d call you on your behavior. I\u2019m sorry, but despite what you may hope, group projects don\u2019t disappear when you leave school, and you could really hurt your career if you pulled a stunt like this in the real world.", "**ESH.** What you did was cold and calculated. The decisions you made regarding removing her name should have been a group decision and not yours alone. If this was a group decision (including notifying Ann) then my answer would be NTA. Ann's poor history of participation and her lack of effort in attending the two group meetings left her in the situation she is in. She has no one to blame but herself.\n\nIf she was out due to medical issues she should have made arrangements with her teacher (and at mimimum you and her group). She did neither.", "YTA.  Its not your job to punish Ann.  \n\nIf she is as awful as you say she is she will fall flat soon enough.  You didn't know if she was in the hospital or not.  Your other teammates had the right idea.  They worried about themselves and their grade and weren't punitive.  \n\nI wonder how you would have felt if the other two has decided that you hadn't contributed as much as them and just phoned it in so they tried to have your grade lowered.", "YTA\n\nThis could end up causing a problem for you. All Ann will have to do is message the teacher and let them know that you intentionally deleted the shared document and then purposely sent her the wrong replacement document. \n\nThe teacher knows what should have been completed as they made the groups and will only have to look at what you and the other two members submitted.\n\nIt's sucky that Ann didn't pull her weight, but it's none of your business if she is sick or not. Teacher said to be a group. If you really had a problem with Ann, you should have taken it up with the teacher. \n\nInstead, you did some shady maneuvers. \n\nAnd it's quite possible everyone will find out.", "NTA - those who worked on it got graded accordingly.", "YTA-  she might have done a crappy thing but you did a crappier thing.  Your other group members didn't care so why was it your right to make the decision.  This should have been handled differently.  Just because she isn't up to your standards it doesn't give you the right to sabotage her.", "YTA and your group members should report you to the professor or whoever is in charge of this class. How dare you go behind the entire group's back to remove someone's name from the project? You're not tough enough to say anything to her face about her performance, but you're tough enough to go behind everyone's backs and make changes to the assignment? In my opinion, you deserve to fail the course for removing her access and tampering with her ability to pass the class.  You could've turned this in and talked to the professor yourself but you chose the most cowardly and petty option possible. YTA SO HARD.", "NTA.", "I knew the other group members were going to side with Ann, since they haven\u2019t worked with her before and believe her excuse, but yeah, after reading all the judgments from people I\u2019ve realized that this should\u2019ve been a group decision, and that I should\u2019ve talked to Ann about not wanting to send her a copy instead of sabotaging it for her. But she really did deserve the fail at the end since most of her work from that course I had done and it wasn\u2019t really her. I now realize that the way I reacted was shady and wrong, and I\u2019ll approach a similar situation in the future more carefully, but I also hope that Ann learns from what happened to her too, and that she needs to work and get grades she deserves, she might get put in similar situations in the future and I hope she remembers this and that not everyone\u2019s going to be nice with her and learn from it. I really hope both of us grow and learn after this since I realize now we were both assholes.", "NTA The story about her being sick made up she tried to take advantage of you and she got fucked in the long term.\n\nEdit: If the story about her being in the hospital is true then you would be the AH", "YTA\n\nThat was so spiteful. \n\nWhat a horrible thing to do.", "YTA, do you even know she wasn't in the hospital?", "YTA for not telling your group about it before you went ahead with your plan.

Still, you have no idea what happened to her.\n\nBut, there's no \"maybe\" about you.  You are an unmitigated asshole.  One who apparently doesn't know how to use the 'enter' key.\n\nYTA", "This is fucked up. YTA. If she isn\u2019t pulling her weight then report it to the lecturer.

This was supposed to be a group project, whether you like it or not. That means the whole group had to have a say on how it was handled, not just YOU unilaterally deciding to eject someone from the project moments before you pulled the trigger. Whether her illness was real or fake, this is something you should have discussed with all the group members rather than making the choice on your own.
