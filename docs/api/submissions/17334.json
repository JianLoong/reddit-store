But you didn't want to do that, and I can guess why: you knew that Ann actually participated in the project, and you suspected that the other group members (and possibly the professor) would believe that she was ill and give her a pass on the part she missed, so you wouldn't be able to fully \"punish\" her for her prior behavior \n\nYTA for going behind people's backs to manipulate the situation", "You are such a YTA.

It's infuriating to have someone hinder your work and benefit from your efforts. That being said you actively went out of your way to make sure she failed without bringing it up to her or talking about your grievances with her first.

You sabotaged her ability to at least try to complete the assignment. My guess is that you just don't like her. You could've helped her out with her portion of all the group work you did with her over the entire semester, including the final, but you let her turn in inferior work time and time again and just cleaned it up for her instead. That's not help, btw. Helping her would've been sitting down with her and explaining things she doesn't understand, helping her with spelling and grammar, etc. It seems like the whole group was unwilling to help her out as well.

Second, her lack of quality work previously has nothing to do with what happened in the most recent group, so your justifications don\u2019t even make sense.

But she really did deserve the fail at the end since most of her work from that course I had done and it wasn\u2019t really her. I now realize that the way I reacted was shady and wrong, and I\u2019ll approach a similar situation in the future more carefully, but I also hope that Ann learns from what happened to her too, and that she needs to work and get grades she deserves, she might get put in similar situations in the future and I hope she remembers this and that not everyone\u2019s going to be nice with her and learn from it.

If you really wanted to stand up for yourself you should have told her you were taking her name off the project & would no longer allow her to have access", "ESH It's not fair for her to mooch off of you, but the right thing to do would've been to discuss this with the instructor and ask not to be grouped with her when you found out it was a group assignment or to discuss this with her and with your group before you started working on it and when she didnt show up. Use your words to stand up for yourself instead of playing petty tricks", "YTA. Talk to your professor.", "Listen, I've been in your place. I was beyond frustrated with people who simply don't contribute to group projects. I can understand not wanting to confront people, but giving her the wrong assignment and hiding what you did from other teammates was plain wrong. The easiest solution was to confide in your professor that she doesn't contribute. Nothing else needed to be done - you didn't need to bring it up with your teammates, you didn't need to tell her to contribute more, you didn't need to share a fake assignment. I relate to your frustration but YTA", "YTA. If Ann is paying for college she has grounds to sue the OP for any additional cost her failing the class incurred. This isn\u2019t just being an asshole, it\u2019s actual fraud. What a petty jerk. Hope she sues the shit out of OP.", "I'm a teacher and it sucks but I have to just be like it is what it is... But I'll gladly fail a kid I watch not work while their group gets an A. And I'll refuse to give points to kids just cause they have a name on a project.", "Most teachers and professors dgaf they say that if someone doesn\u2019t do their share let them know but they do nothing about it or say figure it out among yourselves. I\u2019ve been in op shoes and I understand where they\u2019re coming from (I\u2019m an older student) I refuse to let anyone get credit or give them notes if they don\u2019t bother to show up for class or not participate in the assignment.  \nso what if other student know what op did, going forward they know op won\u2019t take them doing no work and expect to get full credit for it.. if the others want to be suckers and helped this lazy student that\u2019s on them.. they can do that next time if they are unfortunate enough to have another class with her.", "All of this. \n\nPlus OP your experience in a group collaboration closely mimics how it is in the real world. Sometimes you do more work than others in the group. Sometimes people will take credit for work and ideas that were yours. \n\nIf you decided to delete work because your feeling petty you would be fired so fast. Now be a good little worker and fall in line. Its not about shinning, its about a good end result.", "This, yeah. Going to the professor after the Zoom meeting Ann didn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t) attend and report her absence would\u2019ve been fine. Make it their problem to find a way for Ann to earn her grade. \n\nBut this level of backstabbing is not going to endear OP to anyone.", "Wanted to add, if that didn't work speaking to their professor first would be another adult solution.", "Yup. OP went from people-pleaser to passive-agressive. Still avoiding confrontations.", "Classmate should have at least done something. No one owes her extra help. SHE knows she does shitty work and should have gotten tutoring.", ">I knew the other group members were going to side with Ann\n\nThen you should have let them. Two votes against one. Majority rules. That's how group projects operate.\n\nYou could have told the instructor that Ann was a no show. The other two group members could have confirmed it.\n\nYou didn't need to actively sabotage Ann and had no right to make that decision unilaterally on behalf of the entire group.", "So youre a mega AH and a control freak. Got it!", "NOTHING, she didn\u2019t even know the topic we picked.", "But would you punish a kid who acted the way OP did? Because that\u2019s fucked up.", "After the first meeting you should have explained to your group your history with her and suggested that together you contact the instructor about her non participation in the agreed meeting. You should have also messaged her for a reason. It would be the instructor\u2019s responsibility to ask for evidence of her hospital admission. You can also keep evidence of editing history to show that she didn\u2019t contribute to the document.", "This is so euphoria maddy lmao", "Why in the world do *you* know what the instructor is/isn't emailing Ann about? and what Ann is/isn't emailing the instructor about?\n\nUnless Ann is telling you, for some unknown reason, what emails are being exchanged between her and the instructor, you shouldn't have any of that information.\n\nAnd if your instructor is telling you, for some unknown reason, what emails are being exchanged between them and another student, *especially in relation to a medical situation*, then they are very likely breaching the school's privacy rules, as are you, and neither of you get to be on your high moral horse here.", "I doubt you talked to your professor a private medical note is between a student and the school. It has nothing to do with you and why a teacher would tell you if a student was or was not seen at a hospital is beyond me. So you\u2019re either lying or your professor is negligent.", "No one has to prove they are in the hospital, they are entitled to privacy. The only thing you should have done is speak to your instructor about being down a member", "Oh yeah I mean you are an asshole but only because you didn\u2019t bring the other two in and ask them in my opinion. It made you look a bit bad, but dude people who don\u2019t do shit for a group project are the WORST", "This is what I would have done. I'm not the mediator I'm not the instructor this isn't my course but it is my grade so the most I would've done is speak to the instructor beforehand. Express your concerns and if the result was the same (that she didn't contribute) go to the instructor with proof and she'll handle it on the other student's end of accountability.", "Tbf, teachers do usually require some type of doctor's note if you're asking for extra time or to be excused from a project or etc. That being said, you definitely don't have to give the details of why you were in the hospital, just you have to prove you were. But regardless of that, the teacher should never have discussed whether she was out wasn't in the hospital with another person, especially with another student. That seems like a huge breach of privacy and could get them in trouble.", "If she doesn't want to show her paperwork or whatever, showing she was in the hospital, then I believe at the very least, a doctor's note is required. At least when you work someplace, that's how it works.", "Yeah, i can't imagine a professor (im assuming college, but who knows) would NEVER discuss the discipline of anothed student, their grades, or work ethic with another student in the class. Unless that instructor is hoping to be fired.", "Sickness doesn\u2019t wait until a certain time. She may have chronic health issues.", "Idk how old OP is but I never had a college professor ask for proof of anything, they always just trusted us to handle our shit and be honest if we needed extra time or help. Either way OP should have just spoken to their instructor and let them handle it for sure", "I\u2019ve never had a job or a professor that didn\u2019t just trust us. That sounds like a terrible way to live, not only do you have to be concerned about your health, but you have to get paperwork to prove that you\u2019re suffering."]}
