It's infuriating to have someone hinder your work and benefit from your efforts. That being said you actively went out of your way to make sure she failed without bringing it up to her or talking about your grievances with her first.

You sabotaged her ability to at least try to complete the assignment. My guess is that you just don't like her. You could've helped her out with her portion of all the group work you did with her over the entire semester, including the final, but you let her turn in inferior work time and time again and just cleaned it up for her instead. That's not help, btw. Helping her would've been sitting down with her and explaining things she doesn't understand, helping her with spelling and grammar, etc. It seems like the whole group was unwilling to help her out as well.

Second, her lack of quality work previously has nothing to do with what happened in the most recent group, so your justifications don\u2019t even make sense.

But she really did deserve the fail at the end since most of her work from that course I had done and it wasn\u2019t really her. I now realize that the way I reacted was shady and wrong, and I\u2019ll approach a similar situation in the future more carefully, but I also hope that Ann learns from what happened to her too, and that she needs to work and get grades she deserves, she might get put in similar situations in the future and I hope she remembers this and that not everyone\u2019s going to be nice with her and learn from it.

If you really wanted to stand up for yourself you should have told her you were taking her name off the project & would no longer allow her to have access", "ESH It's not fair for her to mooch off of you, but the right thing to do would've been to discuss this with the instructor and ask not to be grouped with her when you found out it was a group assignment or to discuss this with her and with your group before you started working on it and when she didnt show up. Use your words to stand up for yourself instead of playing petty tricks", "YTA. Talk to your professor.", "Listen, I've been in your place. I was beyond frustrated with people who simply don't contribute to group projects. I can understand not wanting to confront people, but giving her the wrong assignment and hiding what you did from other teammates was plain wrong. The easiest solution was to confide in your professor that she doesn't contribute. Nothing else needed to be done - you didn't need to bring it up with your teammates, you didn't need to tell her to contribute more, you didn't need to share a fake assignment. I relate to your frustration but YTA", "YTA. If Ann is paying for college she has grounds to sue the OP for any additional cost her failing the class incurred.

And I'll refuse to give points to kids just cause they have a name on a project.", "Most teachers and professors dgaf they say that if someone doesn\u2019t do their share let them know but they do nothing about it or say figure it out among yourselves. I\u2019ve been in op shoes and I understand where they\u2019re coming from (I\u2019m an older student) I refuse to let anyone get credit or give them notes if they don\u2019t bother to show up for class or not participate in the assignment.  \nso what if other student know what op did, going forward they know op won\u2019t take them doing no work and expect to get full credit for it.. if the others want to be suckers and helped this lazy student that\u2019s on them.. they can do that next time if they are unfortunate enough to have another class with her.", "All of this. \n\nPlus OP your experience in a group collaboration closely mimics how it is in the real world. Sometimes you do more work than others in the group.

The only thing you should have done is speak to your instructor about being down a member", "Oh yeah I mean you are an asshole but only because you didn\u2019t bring the other two in and ask them in my opinion. It made you look a bit bad, but dude people who don\u2019t do shit for a group project are the WORST", "This is what I would have done. I'm not the mediator I'm not the instructor this isn't my course but it is my grade so the most I would've done is speak to the instructor beforehand. Express your concerns and if the result was the same (that she didn't contribute) go to the instructor with proof and she'll handle it on the other student's end of accountability.", "Tbf, teachers do usually require some type of doctor's note if you're asking for extra time or to be excused from a project or etc. That being said, you definitely don't have to give the details of why you were in the hospital, just you have to prove you were. But regardless of that, the teacher should never have discussed whether she was out wasn't in the hospital with another person, especially with another student. That seems like a huge breach of privacy and could get them in trouble.", "If she doesn't want to show her paperwork or whatever, showing she was in the hospital, then I believe at the very least, a doctor's note is required. At least when you work someplace, that's how it works.", "Yeah, i can't imagine a professor (im assuming college, but who knows) would NEVER discuss the discipline of anothed student, their grades, or work ethic with another student in the class.

She may have chronic health issues.", "Idk how old OP is but I never had a college professor ask for proof of anything, they always just trusted us to handle our shit and be honest if we needed extra time or help. Either way OP should have just spoken to their instructor and let them handle it for sure", "I\u2019ve never had a job or a professor that didn\u2019t just trust us.

Maybe they wanted this person in their debt.  \n\nThis is coming from someone who has both organized a lot of group projects and done a lot of group projects.  I've been in your shoes and your teachers shoes and it sucks when someone won't contribute to a group project from both sides.

Nancy was a liar. Funny part is I had to correct 80% of her work.\n\nGuess what? Everyone in the group shunned Nancy after that. She showed her true colors. Backstabbing, for no reason.\n\nAlternatively, I had a group one with three other people. One girl, Gretchen, never came to one meeting on campus or off campus. She had millions of excuses. She contributed two sentences to the entire assignment. We even scheduled the final project meeting around her schedule. We all met up to print and bind everything - no Gretchen.

Every individual member had to speak.Everyone on the team would be graded the same.\n\nSo the smart one couldn't do all the smart work and get the whole team good marks.

Not only was she conveniently sick the day of the project but she also didn\u2019t send a text out until right after the project was done? This just seems way too coincidental.\n\nMy college may be different but all my professors encourage honest groupmate reviews when working on a project. If you did nothing for the whole project then you\u2019re going to get a 0 while everyone else gets the same grade. I may be more jaded because I had 2 years where people just didn\u2019t show up for group projects and I had to restructure my entire week just to maybe see them if I\u2019m lucky. From what it sounds like she\u2019s a slacker that\u2019s coasted off of subpar work for the last couple of years. If she was truly sick she can give the professor a doctors note and get an extension on the project. But people lie all the time because people lie and college students enjoy the college life. Part of group project is learning to work in a group. She didn\u2019t show up and do anything for this project and she provided subpar work for previous projects.

That is not for you to dictate. If you were really that worried about it then why did you not take your concerns to the professor when groups were assembled?

For the last couple of days before turn in time, he was completely unresponsive. So we collectivly chose to not put his name on the project. We explained it to the professor. That he didn't contribute and went MIA in the end. \n\nThe dude was upset, saying he felt ill and went to the hospital. AND he had the papers to prove it!! Imagine our shock. He indeed came up with papers from hospital that he was there on the final day of the assigntments due date. Till this day we all believe he either faked the papers, or more likely illness to go to the hospital in the first place.\n\nSo... I'm not sure. Soft YTA because you didn't talk to your other teammates before you excluded her.", "YTA \n\nYou should have told her that she didn\u2019t do the work she cannot have her name on the assignment. And if she had a doctors note etc she could have discussed it with your teacher/professor or whom ever. \n\nYou chose to lie instead and purposely made her fail. \n\nYour edit is irritating to read because it makes you seem like you\u2019re trying to be the victim. You chose this. There\u2019s a time and place for a lesson to be learnt and being a cowball about it is not the way you help yourself or anyone else. None of your classmates will ever trust you to not do the same to them even if they did participate.", " NTA mate, I\u2019ve dealt with too many slobs on group projects before\n\nI also had a dude do ZERO work then lie on the entire group claiming WE were the ones who weren\u2019t working, claimed a file he was supposed to receive was corrupted but it suddenly \u201cWorked\u201d when the girl gave it to me and I sent to to him.\n\nSo he deleted our project and did the entire thing himself. Claimed we were lazy.\n\nScrew these pampered lying ass people. Sometimes you need to stoop to their level.", "YTA. In these situations you take it up with the teacher. You don't decide yourself to sabotage someone's grade just because you're mad they didn't help. \n\nYou stated you've done projects with this person before so you knew they probably weren't gonna pull through. Because you were aware of that your reaction was unwarranted, it just makes it seem as though you were plotting this from the beginning. \n\nIf you weren't able to tell her up front you were gonna remove her name and have the others summit it so that she couldn't get credit then you shouldn't have done it in the first place. If you feel that strongly about it you should have been bold enough to tell her the reason why you didn't want her to get credit. \n\nIf you didn't want to be upfront about it like I said before you should have took it up with the teacher.", "YTA. This was not your decision to make. You went behind everyone\u2019s back to sabotage Ann. I\u2019m not sure you even realise that long term you sabotaged yourself as well. You seem to think this is a one off thing? But no one is going to forget you did this to a project partner. And no one is going to trust you going forward because who knows when you\u2019ll think it\u2019s justified to sabotage someone else. You did it once, why wouldn\u2019t people expect you to do it again?", "YTA. You don't just remove people from group project because you want to. \n\nWhat you do it is set clear boundaries and consequences.  \"If you don't submit your work to us until xx date we'll have to remove you from the group\". I've done this before, they didn't like but they totally deserved it. And of course, with the group involved.", "Hey, if you're going to do this, at least have the bravery to actually take responsibility. Don't do this cowardly stuff where you hide behind other people and then send false documents.\n\nIf you want to show someone that you think they contributed nothing, do the bare minimum and state so out loud. I consider secret, behind-the-back sabotage to not only be pretty pathetic, but also just a genuinely bad idea.\n\nWhy? Because now it's hard to prove that you're not just executing a personal witch hunt. If your group members had agreed, you'd have better evidence in a complaint to a professor. Now though? If she complains, she's got a good argument to suggest that it's entirely your fault. \n\nPlus, in the ever-wonderful court of public opinion, she can now tell absolutely anyone that you go behind people's backs and change their work. Not to mention putting the same implication on your group.\n\nYTA. Take some responsibility for your actions. Don't be underhanded.", "What authority do you have? Are you a teacher? A teacher's assistant? No. You are a student. Act like it. \n\nYTA", "NTA. You understood the game she was playing and played it better. \n\nAlso, even if she was in the hospital, she still didn\u2019t demonstrate that she knew the skills and knowledge for the assignment, so she should not pass that part.", "YTA. \nI just completed a degree that involves a ton of group work. We create team agreements before starting (which your teacher should try), that way when someone fails to do their part we can handle it internally before getting the professor involved. Not only did you not get the teacher involved, you didn't talk to the teammates OR this person you had beef with. While you do have proof Ann was slacking, this could definitely be considered sabotage, which reflects extremely poorly on you.", "ESH. I'd have failed you for failing the \"groupwork\" aspect of the task miserably.", "YTA and you sound like one of those people who is like \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d, regardless of if another person does their work perfectly fine but in a different way.", "YTA. I understand the frustration of having to do those ridiculous group projects where you don\u2019t even get to pick your team.  No one ever does the same amount of work so it\u2019s frustrating.  *However* you didn\u2019t give her a chance to finish her part.  I could understand deleting it one minute before it was due if she hadn\u2019t done anything but other than that YTA", "Yes, you have issues", "You have to be wary of cowards - the second they get any power they abuse it as they take out their feelings of helplessness in disproportionate manners.\n\nYTA and you\u2019ll do more overreactions I\u2019m sure.", "YTA. But OP you need to seek help to stand up for yourself in a healthier way.", "YTA. \n\ni\u2019ve had a girl do this to me in high school. she thought she did more work then i did even though we worked together on it and we argued about it, she then turned it in early and told the teacher i did absolutely nothing when it absolutely wasn\u2019t true and i got a zero and had to make up the assignment on my own. you gotta work with people you dont like to work with sometimes but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to take credit for all of it. she may half ass it and she may turn it in last minute but she did the damn work. give her that. your partner were right to call you out.", "You simply could have messaged your professor to let them know what was going on or you could\u2019ve messaged a group member to make sure ann was okay. When you take things into your own hands like you did here you can end up sabotaging yourself. YTA", "ESH. So Ann didn't turn up and do any work so what did she expect exactly? Credit for everyone else's work?", "Here\u2019s a different take: if OP put anyone\u2019s name on it that didn\u2019t actually do the assignment, wouldn\u2019t that be fraud? It would be inaccurate and it would diminish the teacher\u2019s ability to accurately grade the work.", "Yup YTA, an absolute asshole, be ashamed of yourself.\nI'm sure you're a very diligent and capable student, but this is some BS. You're gonna do great in life as that AH that everyone's gonna complain about.", "Oh come on she had already proven herself to be a proven slacker and user twice before and did not provide any proof of a supposed hospitalization.  Slacker deserved it.", "If they all submitted the assignment before he removed Ann\u2019s name, I assume it was a live document so nobody noticed? But if that\u2019s the case, you can usually see the edit history, which would show OP removing Ann\u2019s name, and I\u2019m surprised nobody brought that up?", "Yah - the grammar in this post completely discredits it for me. I've seen this happen before. An AH group partner will go through and \"correct\" someone's grammar and start to brew resentment for the perceived errors. However, in reality the grammar was fine before and the AH is making it worse. The AH often has a misguided belief that they are skilled in all things, including writing.\n\nAs for OP's situation: YTA", "If she had really been in hospital she'd be able to get a note and explain to the university or file an appeal. Universities want proof though.\n\nOP was rather high handed about it and shouldn't have acted alone. And should have spoken to the lecturers/profs on the previous occasions when the freeloader wasn't doing any work! I can understand why she's frustrated, but it's not a constructive way to go about things.", "Even if this claim is true, it's doesn't prove she lied.", "Which is irrelevant, the point of group projects is to make you ready for real world to work with other people with different abilities and mentalities. If you go questioning someone else\u2019s medical problems real or not in real world hr will have you packing in no time. Learning to resolve conflicts is a skill that they are trying to teach by giving you group projects", ">That's why the other group people are pissed.\n\nThey're amgry because OP could have randomly deleted their names as well.", "Sure,  but that professor is NEVER going to discuss another students grades and/or medical issues (or lack there of) with any other student. So OP is already an admitted liar and is an untrustworthy narrator. Also, 90% of my undergraduate and graduate professors don\u2019t ask for notes. I get them just in case but I\u2019ve rarely actually needed one. They know that when college kids congregate, people get sick. And grad students are broke lol", "But that would be fine if this assignment was the first time they worked together - she knows her form from the past, she's had to re-do her work mins before submission time.  This person is a user, and is untrustworthy and its unacceptable she passes constantly because of others work not hers. If she truly was in the hospital then all she has to do is submit proof and get an exemption and re-do the assignment. Even if she was in hospital she still shouldnt be allowed to pass for 0 contribution, she has to make up for it.\n\nBUT i do think OP went completely the wrong way about it - she needed to just inform the professor by email before the submission deadline and let them deal with it.", "Still costs a co-pay and the prescriptions still cost money.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
