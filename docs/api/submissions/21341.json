Our father had passed away a few years ago, and he had saved money for my sister's quincea\u00f1era. We worked hard to contribute as well. However, there were conflicts with our cousin who wanted to be part of court and caused fits about it. She was mad she wasn\u2019t apart of it even though her brother was. We explained to her we were only doing chambelanes for her court instead of damas. This left her still furious. On the day of the quincea\u00f1era, I had prepared a picture of our father for the father-daughter dance, but it was ripped up and damaged leaving me heartbroken and In tears. I found a clue, a press-on nail, which was left on the ground. This led me to suspect my cousin, she had the same kind of press on nails and was even missing one. Confronting her resulted in an argument with my aunt. She was yelling at me saying it wasn\u2019t her daughter then started insulting me and my sister which lead me to kicking her out. I was still sad about the picture and not being able to surprise my sister with it, but my sister's boyfriend saved the day by revealing he had bought a picture wanting to surprise my sister.

My cousin was sorta young so I felt like I should have handled it a different way and not just yell at her face for it since people make mistakes. I felt sorta bad because I had done it infront of everyone and I should have done it more later. I\u2019m supposed to be a bigger person and yelling at my younger cousin should have not been the best choice.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There is no universe in which that is acceptable behavior and I will not tolerate any harassment or bad mouthing of myself, my mother or my sister. Aunt and cousin deserved to be kicked out for their absolutely abhorrent behavior.\u201d And then maybe if you\u2019re catholic bring in some saints to really drive home the shame and guilt they should feel.", "NTA. They caused a fuss and rightly were asked to leave.
