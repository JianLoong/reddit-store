They never met my mom and were never part of my  mom's family.\n\nMy mom died when I was 7.\n\nMy grandma owned the scrapbook and after mom died she and the rest of the family agreed I should be the next person to have it. It was given to me when I was 8 and I had it until I was 11. But my dad's wife was very interested in it and it made me uncomfortable so I asked my grandma to keep it for me. I'm now 16(m) and I have half siblings who are 6, 4 and 3. The 6 year olds are twin girls and they were told about the scrapbook by my dad and maybe his wife.\n\nThey wanted to see it and help me work on it because they heard it belongs to me now. They first asked me about it at Christmas and said they want to add their own photos to it. I told them it wasn't for them. They said I'm their brother so I should add them and our younger brother and sister. I told them it wasn't how it worked. They brought it up a few weeks after that. Then dad told me I should ask my grandma for it back and include my half siblings in it. I told him I wasn't going to add them for something for my family from mom when they weren't related to them. He said it shouldn't matter since they are related to me.\n\nA couple of weeks ago they cried into my face for like an hour over it and I told dad to deal with it because I'm not asking my grandma for the book back and it won't be coming back into his (dad's) house because I don't want my half siblings to get their hands on it. Dad had told me I was being spiteful and should use it as a way to accept my half siblings better because I'm not close to them like I should be. My half siblings either heard or dad told them what I said because they asked why I don't want them to touch it.\n\nI told them it was part of my mom's family and they were not part of my mom's family. They said our sister was included (my sister was born before me, she died when she was 3 weeks old) and so they should be too. I told them my sister was mom's child. They asked if I wanted them in the book and would I ask for them and I said it was for my mom's family and did not answer directly. They cried. Then my dad called me an asshole and told me if my sister could be in it, I could include the others too, because they're aware of it and are getting hurt by my refusal to include them and by keeping it from them. I told him they wouldn't be hurt if he hadn't told them about it.\n\nBut AITA for keeping it from them?", "created_utc": 1680539201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12apix1/aita_for_keeping_my_maternal_family_scrapbook/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids that age have the attention span of a gnat, and don\u2019t understand why something like a scrapbook would be important to anyone.  They are definitely being coached and prodded by one or both of their parents, who are using the children to manipulate you in the name of some twisted family bonding.  Tell your father that if the kids have hurt feelings it will NOT be your fault but theirs; if there is distance between you and his children it\u2019s because he and his wife created that distance.

You are in the right here", "Absolutely not!  And your dad and stepmom need to back off.  Your dad in particular knows that this scrapbook came from your mother's family - why is he pushing this?

You\u2019re most definitely doing the right thing by keeping it away from your dad\u2019s house. From the outside looking in, it appears as if he\u2019s trying to erase your mom. I personally believe if you were to bring it back into the house, your mom\u2019s pictures would start disappearing. The only way to prevent that is never having at your dad\u2019s house ever again. Your poor half siblings are being used to do this to you. It\u2019s horrible that their parents are doing this to them. I am a lot on the petty side and definitely suggest you getting back at them (your dad and stepmom) by using your half siblings. Turn about is fair play. If you have money, go out and buy scrapbook stuff and start a scrapbook with just you and your half siblings to begin with. Do this with them. They will most likely want your dad and their mom\u2019s pictures but have that after a few pages. Make the first few pages are with just you kids. If you don\u2019t have any money of your own or not enough, tell your maternal side of the family for money and why. It\u2019s a great way to make the half siblings feel special and it\u2019s a tiny piece of revenge for two adults using children to try and erase your biological mom. Nobody can be upset by it either. Then after you have used all the current pictures, your siblings can keep going with it when they get new pictures of the family!"]}
