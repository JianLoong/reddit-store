{"id": 12097, "submission_id": "11p62ac", "title": "WIBTA for not showing up to plans because I was never invited?", "selftext": "I know the title might be a little strange. But I will try to explain.\n\nMy sister (18F) and I (20F) live in the same city for college. We are the only 2 family members that live there, everyone else lives further north.\n\nShe invited two of our cousins (19F and 21F) to stay with her for the weekend next week. She never told me she invited them. She worked with them to figure out the date, time, where they would sleep, and activities they would do. Again, without telling me any of this.\n\nWe both traveled to my parents house over break. During dinner with our entire family, my mom asks \"anyone have any fun plans coming up?\" My sister then decides to bring up these plans with our cousins. This was the FIRST time I had ever heard about it.\n\nI immediately asked about the plans, and if she ever planned on telling me about them. She stated that the plans were made a few days ago and she was \"telling me now\". But she had only brought it up because she was prompted the question. She never asked if I was free that weekend so she had no idea if I could even make it. (and she most likely didn't care).\n\nObviously, her telling the dinner table was not a personal invite for me. If she wanted me to come she would have said \"you should join us\" or \"come with!\" Or perhaps she would ask if I was even busy that weekend before making plans. But she did not do any of that. I fear that she will feel the need to invite me out of pity because she accidentally brought it up. I will not feel welcome to join them at that point.\n\nMy sister and I are equally close with these cousins. We rarely ever get to see them. I am also very sad that neither of them told me either. But it is possible that they assumed my sister told me or that I was in on the plan.\n\nAnyways, I don't plan on showing up. But I know my sister very well. My cousins will probably ask where I am and she will explain to our cousins that I am choosing to not show up because I am rude or dislike them. She will probably also call me (in a way they can hear) and confront me and ask why I am not there. Also, I do not want my cousins to feel like I am ignoring them out of pettiness. Despite really wanting to see them, I genuinely don't feel welcome.\n\nI am in a horrible spot. I have been stressing about this so much since I found out. I am not sure what to do. I don't want to seem petty but I also feel unwanted and unwelome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Someone asked about my relationship with my sister. I think that was a good question and maybe that context would help people. My relationship with her isn't the greatest. She is the type of sister who still teases me for my weight. And if I mess up (such as stutter or mispronounce a word) she will point it out to other people in the room and get them to laugh at me. She contributes a lot to my social anxiety. I never react or yell because I am older than her and am trying to be the mature sibling. But as a result, she walks all over me.", "created_utc": 1678598047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p62ac/wibta_for_not_showing_up_to_plans_because_i_was/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So you're good to go on that front.\n\nIf you're worried about your sister trash talking you to your cousins, it's pretty easy to preempt that with an email. Send your cousins a message and say that you heard they'll be in town, but it also seems your sister has made plans, so they might be fairly busy, but if they have some free time and would like to come by and visit, to give you a call and you'd love to see them.\n\nYou don't have to explain anything about your sister, or the strife that apparently exists between the two of you. Your cousins probably already have some idea about it, and it's not really their business. The important thing for your cousins to understand is that plans with you are separate from plans with your sister. And they will understand it, as long as your email is plainly worded.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe get ahead of the issue by contacting your cousins.  Tell her you found out they're coming over family dinner, your sister didn't invite you but you still want to see them.  Invite them for coffee or dinner.  No need to involve someone that doesn't like you in her life.", "INFO: I think we need to know more about your relationship with your sister. Does she often behave in a spiteful way towards you?", "Don\u2019t stress, your sister is at fault here for excluding you. I wouldn\u2019t go either seeing as how you weren\u2019t invited. If your sister does phone you then say exactly that \u2018I wanted to come to see cousins but you made it clear I was neither invited or wanted\u2019 NTA", "OP, stop trying to be a sister to a person who does not care- it does do your mental health any good. Go LC- let her come back into your life if she so chooses. \n\nYou cannot live your life in fear of being judged by others- if they really care about you, they will reach to you.", "Contact your cousins. The words you're looking for are \"I heard you might be in town soon and would love to meet up. When are you visiting?\" When they tell you about all the plans with sis and invite you along, you can say \"oh no, I'm busy that weekend! I wish I'd known the dates of your visit sooner, I would have kept it open. Say hi to my sister for me though, we hardly ever find time to talk. Isn't it funny? We live in the same city but I mostly hear about her through mom!\" The tone you're aiming for in that last bit is light and breezy. You'll get to give your regrets to them, circumvent your sister's weirdness, and let them know that they need to talk to you if they want to see y all in one go.\n\nAnd NTA by the way. And your sister sounds like my father, btw. Once I became an adult he was constantly either making plans and then bailing on me or telling me about things only when it was too late for me to attend.", "no judgment but please go to see them at least once. i completely understand how you're feeling because i've been in your situation and it sucks feeling unwanted, but in the past when i've had plans and not wanted to invite someone i simply didn't mention it in front of the other people. maybe she forgot to tell you or maybe she doesn't want you there, but you shouldn't miss out on seeing your cousins because of this. maybe go with the intention of staying for an hour, and if the vibes are good then stay with them! if things feel weird you can make up an excuse to leave. you can also text them and let them know that you heard they were coming next weekend and to let you know what the plans are.", "ESH.

Also she should have included you.", "NTA. \n\nJust ask your sister, \u201cwhat time are we meeting our cousins?\u201d", "Your 'sister' is abusing you.

Have a good time focused on your cousins, and don't worry what your sister thinks. \nIf you're feeling extra brave and cheeky, make a witty (not mean) joke about how you had to invite yourself because your sister didn't actually invite you, in front of your cousins. If your sister says anything behind your back to them, you've already covered yourself", "NTA", "I am sitting on the fence.   \nGo crash the party.   \n\n\nTip: don\u2019t give yourself high blood pressure, give your sis high blood pressure. Don\u2019t let her make you feel anxious, make her feel anxious.", "NTA. But I think you should try to spend time with your cousins. I think you could also tell your sister that you feel a bit hurt that she didn\u2019t mention anything sooner and that you\u2019d like to be included, if that\u2019s cool with everyone. Be direct in your communication so there\u2019s no confusion on your end about where you stand. I think being passive or avoidant in this kind of situation will only reinforce your sister to bully or mistreat you.", "NTA. Your sister clearly didn\u2019t mean to include you in the plans. Tell your cousins, if they ask, that you only found out about it recently and it was to late for you to change your plans, but you love them and hope to see them soon. Stop hanging out with your sister unless you have to, what you describe is selfish and immature conduct, don\u2019t subject yourself to that.", "NTA  I would however call your cousins and say that you found out over dinner at your mom's that they were going to be in town and was was wondering if they'd maybe have time to go to brunch with you one day. If they ask if you aren't coming out with them tell them the truth that you weren't invited and only found out that they'd be in town when your sister told your mom. You can add you already had plans anyway if you want. I definitely wouldn't go because your sister will make sure you don't enjoy yourself anyway.", "NTA. If you really think that your cousins are also not excluding you intentionally, give them a call and keep them.informed that if they were expecting you to show up, you would not be able to do it.\n\nYou could be honest and say that your sister made you feel unwelcome. Or if you feel like avoiding the drama just say that you had plans of your own and it's too late to adjust it anymore since you were not kept in the loop about this visit by your sister", "Your sis is a real peach. NTA.", "WNBTA\n\nBut shut down your sister by contacting your cousins and apologizing for not having time to join them for the weekend, but you made other plans before learning of their visit. Then head home again or spend the weekend elsewhere.", "Do you actually want to join in? Would you have fun? If so, go, enjoy yourself, and don't let your sister spoil your fun.

Sounds like ya'll have a pretty full schedule, but I'd love to at least do dinner one night you're here!\"  NTA, and I would only join for plans that specifically sound fun while they're there.\n\nSounds like you'd probably rather hang out with them without your sister anyway, so maybe take a page from her book and try planning stuff with them yourself?  If the two of you don't get along, it's not bad for you to have independent relationships with family members.", "Drop your cousins an email and throw sister under the bus; say \u201cI just found out you were going to be in town this weekend\u2014sorry I can\u2019t meet up with you as I have plans & sis didn\u2019t bother telling me until today that you were coming.

I did tell her that I wanted to take one of them to a casino. My cousin and I did talk about going to that casino in the past and I said i'd love to take her there some time. At the dinner table I said \"oh maybe I can finally take her there for an hour or so\". My sister isn't old enough to go. Obviously, she got very upset when I said this because I would be \"ditching her\". Kinda ironic.", "Yes constantly. She is insanely stubborn and self-centered. She constantly makes me feel like a burden to her and still teases me in a child-like manner (such as when I stutter, forget my keys, or me weight)", "Thank you for your reply. If she does call, she will likely say \"well I am calling you now and you should come over\" and if i say that I dont want to, I cant imagine how horrible that would make my cousins feel. If I were in their shoes, I would be upset that someone is choosing pettiness over seeing me for the first time in almost a year.", "I'm not saying you're right or wrong, but why are you calling it abuse? She has been like this all my life I am honestly used to it and it feels like a normal sibling relationship to me.", "But she didn't invite her.  Sister was responding to a question their mother asked. From reading her comments, she doesn't want her to go and I say don't go where you're not wanted.", "Im scared to go tbh. She will make fun of me the whole time and try to get them to laugh at me. She always does. And it's always so awkward because they don't always laugh with her, but sometimes they do out of awkwardness.", "I agree, you were never invited (because sister is an AH) - if you are invited to something, you will know it. Like you say, she mentioned her plans around you but that is not the same as being invited. mochi\\_for\\_breakfast has the right idea, reach out beforehand to let them know you'd love to hang out but sister didn't invite you. Sister sounds like a real piece of work.", "Mmmmkay. You're NTA.

If they're close with you, they'll understand.", "It's because she is jealous of you. Call your cousins.and let them know you won't be seeing them during their trip to town because you just found out about. Let them know you appreciate them making the trip and hope they have a great time. You will see them at the next get together.  Let your sister have the time with them.", "Talk directly to your cousins. Ask if they'd like you to come. If they invite you, treat it as genuine and go.", "Why not arrange something yourself with your cousins another day?", "No baby, it's not. Your sibling should be supportive of you and help you to be more confident as a person. Not verbally abusing you and adding to your MH. You are NTA.", "I can do that. And I have thought about it. But I don't want them to feel like I am inviting them purposefully without her to get back at her. I don't want to put them in the middle of her immaturity.\n\nIf I were in their shoes, I would think I was only invited to get back at someone's sister, which isn't genuine either.\n\nPlus I refuse to become as immature as she is."]}
