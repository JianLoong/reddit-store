Forget the nice car v. not-so-nice car. She lost her license for 2 years for drunk driving (not the first time). Got a new car when she was able to drive again, only had it a year before she crashed it while drunk driving AGAIN.  What's the odds she's going to lose her license for more than 2 years, if not permanently?

It was weird that she was comparing vehicles, but I suppose when you get a new car, you want to drive it lots and think it's the best, but weird to tell your partner theirs sucks like that. When will she learn with the drinking and driving? Sounds like her dad just enables it and spoils her so it's no surprise she's sort of a disaster.

This is not something that you can change, for it is the addict that has to decide to change themselves.

I, am a very happy-go-lucky drunk, but did a lot of stupid things while drinking, always lying to myself that I didn't have a problem. Things for me escalated after my fathers death, and I went into a deep, dark hole numbing myself with booze, until a little over 3 years ago I did hit rock bottom, unbeknownst to my family and friends, and made the decision to get sober. You would think that getting her first DUI, she would have hit that low point to seek the help she needs, but it is apparent she has not, and her father isn't doing her any favors in pressuring you to drive her around, and he should instead be encouraging her to seek help. If I were you, I would seriously reevaluate this relationship, because if you break it off it *may* be enough for her to realize that she has a problem, but she also may still have a bit further to go into that hole, and hopefully doesn't bring anyone else with her.\n\nYou are NTA.", "after hitting another family in the same accident and murdering them.
