Ended up going alone since everyone had work and no one I knew liked the band enough to take the day off.\n\nI had spent double on tickets to get the VIP package, which allowed for early entry with a Q&A session with the band.\n\nEverything's going smooth, get in the doors 45 mins early so I can get a good spot near the stage. I go to the bathroom after the Q&A and grab a drink at the bar, and by the time I get back to the stage, a few people had been let, no big deal.\n\nI take up a good spot with only one person standing in front of me who is a good deal shorter than I am, so I'm very happy with my spot.\n\nThe entire time the crowd is flooding in, I keep seeing the guy in front of me looking back, as if he's looking for someone. I get excited, because I assume he's going to go find a friend and leave me the spot right in front.\n\nWell fast forward, another guy reaches over my shoulder and taps the guy in front of me. This other guy is easily 6'4.\n\nThey start talking to each other over my shoulder and the original guy says \"Go get everyone else.\"\n\nHe then looks at me and say \"Do you mind backing up a little so we can all be together?\"\n\nI immediately tell him \"No.\" And he looked shocked. He starts saying \"It's just two other girls and they're very short. It'll be cool.\"\n\nI then get frustrated and tell him \"That's not how concerts work. If I'm taking any steps, it's going to be forward. I paid extra for the VIP ticket and I'm not going to let people force me back!\"\n\nHe says \"FUCKING FINE! MOVE THEN!\" as he steps behind me and joins his friend.\n\nThe rest of the show, I feel his entire group of 4 behind me giving me dirty ass looks, and even felt awkward next to the other two unrelated people who witnessed me argue with him.\n\nI ended up getting the set list and thanked by the singer for being so into it, so I felt a bit justified, but still feel like a dick about the whole thing.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1694640151, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hz9g5/aita_for_refusing_to_move_even_a_step_backwards/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just some entitled folks who thought they should be able to move you--who arrived early and paid for the privilege-- back so they could stand where they want to. Love that you stood your ground, and if they're staring at you angrily, look over your shoulder every now and then with a huge grin and wink like \"isn't this awesome??!!\" Comment on what a great spot it is to your neighbors now and then. So they can get even angrier that you're immune to their petty, futile rage and still enjoying everything while they're mad at you.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
