I'm not saying my wife's concerns aren't valid, because they are. I'm simply not willing to re-home my dog (3yo Heeler). My MIL gave us the dog for free back 2 1/2 years ago and the behaviors have always been there. She gets in to the cat box constantly, she gets up on our table when we aren't looking, she growls at us for redirecting her every single time, she absolutely has bitten the back of my wife's leg when my wife was vacuuming or bitten my wife's hand when my wife went to take away something she wasn't supposed to have. So she's bitten twice over the time we have had her and both times were barely hard enough to draw blood (scratches that had tiny beads of blood). We brought her to the vet and we were told she has a hormonal imbalance, more than likely due to inbreeding (my MIL got her from a breeder in Kentucky so I guess its possible- as we know nothing about the people and were told there was easily 6 male dogs there to two females). She was put on meds and it didn't help the issue. More things are the fact that she runs off/jumps out of our vehicle when we aren't looking and takes off. She has broken through many leads and harnesses, one of them being meant for a large dog (80+lbs). She had jumped out of our vehicle when we stopped at a red light the other day and took off down the street (chewed through her dog seat belt and we didn't realize it). It took us over 4 hours to get her back in the vehicle and my wife missed her doctor's appointment as a result (she's pregnant). \n\nNow the issues were brought up heavy lately because my wife said, and I quote, \"I outright refuse to continue dealing with this when our baby arrives. You have 6 months to find a new trainer and correct her behaviors or the dog is gone.\" We have already been through trainers however and even the trainers have stated that this is likely an imbalance in chemicals, not behavioral. This was after 2 years (she was just taken from the training program 4 months ago). She can't be heavily medicated due to other health related issues. But I'm also not willing to just give up on my dog. My wife on the other hand has no qualms rehoming her because of her being bitten and her simply being completely fed up with \"revolving her life around a dog when she has a baby on the way and no energy\" (missing her appointment and chasing the dog around for 4 hours truly made her resentful because it was the gender ultrasound that she had been looking forward to). I told her I wasn't getting rid of the dog and she immediately started packing her stuff. She's currently with her mother and has texted me and said that she will not be coming home until the dog is gone. I think it's just hormones but my friends have stated I'm an AH because I'm essentially choosing a \"annoying and aggressive\" dog over my wife and unborn child.", "created_utc": 1676816450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116bnbv/aita_for_not_getting_rid_of_my_dog_when_my_wife/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He didn't like me when my parents brought me home and he hated it when I was getting attention and he wasn't. He warmed up ti me though and by the time I was 6 months old, he was sleeping under my cot and would try and stop anyone who wasn't my mum or dad from coming near me. My reason for adding this is that a lot of dogs are jealous of new babies. You're dog has already shown signs of aggression to you and your wife, people it knows, and so its reaction to a new baby in the house, taking the attention away from it, is unlikely to be nuzzling at your arms to try and get you to pet it instead of touching your kid. It'll bite.", "Yta. \n\nYou can't have a dog that is prone to biting people once you bring a baby into the home. \n\nYou need to get rid of this dog before the baby comes. \n\nI'd leave you also. Never chose a dog over the safety of your child.  \n\nDon't be stupid here.  Lose your wife and your baby over a dog?  Come on.", "YTA and I truly hope you see that before it costs you your marriage and child.", "YTA big time. After this much time and all the evidence presented to you indicating this dog will not improve even in the slightest and you are still going to refuse not to give up on it? You\u2019re really going to risk the safety or your pregnant wife and your baby? You do realize if your wife stays with you (I wouldn\u2019t) and something happens to the baby because of the dog, you could be criminally liable? Grow the f up and get rid of the dog or just divorce your wife now so her and her baby can be safe.", "YTA\n\nThis dog has already bitten your wife *twice*. What happens when she bites the baby? You tried trainers, and it didn't work. I don't blame your wife one bit for leaving. A dog like that does not belong in a home with children.\n\nYou're choosing a dog over your wife and unborn child's safety. Let that sink in.", "YTA. That dog doesn\u2019t need to be around the baby because there will be issues. You\u2019re putting the dog above your child and your wife\u2019s concerns. It\u2019s a problem dog that you are not equipped to handle, and you need to give the dog to someone who can. Your wife was completely fair to set the strict boundary of getting the dog trained before the baby is born or rehoming it.", "YTA. I love dogs, I think they are great and could not imagine my life without one and agree that when you adopt a dog it's a lifetime commitment. But you have an aggressive dog that bites and you're going to have a baby, those two things don't mix", "NTA but the calf biting is natural instinct and very hard to train out. They are 90% crazy and unless you are working with them constantly, they will do their own thing. In rural cattle country, you know to be very careful around outdoor heelers. I have seen some great indoor pet heelers but lots of time and training are required. They are a gritty working dog. They have trouble understanding that they cannot herd people. I would 100% not have a baby around that dog.", "YTA an aggressive unstable dog around a child is a recipe for a tragedy. Rehome the dog.", "Are you kidding me? YTA \n\nHow can you write all of that out and not come to the same conclusion.", "YTA. You had years to properly train the dog (chemical imbalance or nay), and chose not to. The dog is violent and unpredictable. You are being *delusional* thinking this dog is not a threat to your pregnant wife and soon-to-be child. Sounds like you've just lost your wife, good for her for keeping herself safe, because she clearly can't rely on her husband to protect her.", "Huge YTA\n\nBiting dogs are put down, no exception. You've had two and a half years to train it to behave and its not working. That dog is a danger and your refusal to see it makes you a huge AH.", "YTA- and this comes from someone who worked in the pet care industry for 7+ years. I agree, you should do everything possible to avoid rehoming your dog. It sounds like you\u2019ve exhausted all avenues between using a trainer as well as speaking with your vet. Your primary focus right now needs to be on the baby coming into your life. Your wife gave you a 6 month time frame to get this figured out or to rehome the dog. I think that\u2019s more than fair. Especially considering she\u2019s the one who has been but several times. Not you. \n\nYou think you\u2019re being selfless by trying to fix your dog when in reality you\u2019re being selfish. You are NOT the right family for this dog. There is someone out there who will be a better fit for the dog. You need to put your wife and your new child first here dude. And please whatever you do, do not blame this on your wife\u2019s hormones. She seems to be the only one of out the two you thinking logically about this.", "YTA and I say this as a dog person. It is not safe to have an aggressive, untrainable dog in the house with a baby, and clearly it's not a good situation for the dog, either.\n\nRe-home him to someone who's experienced with behavior issues & herding breeds and you'll all be happier.", "YTA.\n\nYes, owning a pet should be a lifetime commitment,  but there are exceptions, and you are describing one.  Your commitment to the dog right now is to find her a good home where she will be safe and happy. Your home doesn't fit her needs, and it's creating a dangerous situation for her current humans. See if there's a rescue group for her breed. \n\nMy boss had to rehome a very sweet dog because she was only sweet around older children and adults; once their daughter started crawling, the dog became aggressive towards her even though the baby was never allowed to approach the dog. My boss' family is now safer, and the dog is still happy with her current people.", "YTA\n\nYou haven't been able to find a trainer for the dog, you aren't able to train the dog, you can't medicate the dog to correct the hormone imbalance, and it's proven to be aggressive. \n\nYou aren't able to care for this dog, you can't keep your wife safe from the dog, and you won't be able to keep your child safe from this dog. It needs to be out of your home. Rehomed, sent to a sanctuary, destroyed; make your choice. But you cannot seriously be planning to keep this dog when it presents an active danger to those around it.", "YTA. Your dog is dangerous. Get a proper trainer and work on your dogs behavior and how you all manage it because this is a recipe for disaster. r/reactivedogs  has a lot of great recources so start there.", "YTA. The dog is aggressive and could seriously injure your child. She has already bitten your wife twice, and shows no sign of improvement. It\u2019s selfish to put your feelings about the dog over your wife and child\u2019s safety.", "Did you by any chance mean to put \"YTA\"?", "I doubt that'll happen.", "Exactly! This breed of dog, compounded by the possible inbreeding and other issues, should be on a farm working. The dog obviously doesn't want to be living there anymore than the wife wants it there. It keeps trying to run away!", "It's a hit or miss. Some days she's really good but other days she acts like she's never had an ounce of training. Like most days she loves strangers but some days she will stalk and run up on people. Some days she is good with animals and the next the is going in for a kill.", "If this is real, and I were your wife, I would re-home YOU. (and your dog)", "She's bitten twice and not bad enough to draw anything more than tiny droplets of blood. I don't think she's aggressive. I think she has boundaries. My wife is the one who thinks she is aggressive.", "Plus supervised visitation only.", "The other times she has jumped out of the car is when we are physically parked somewhere and she darts out as soon as we open the door and she takes off. Yesterday was an off chance because we did have the window open but we had her buckled. I didn't see that she had chewed through her buckle.", "According to a previous comment, OT doubts the dog will harm the child.", "Why is that dog still allowed to go on car rides? Was the vet appointment right before your wife\u2019s appointment?\n\nInfo: is this your first baby? \n\nHaving a child changes a person\u2019s feelings toward animals. People might disagree, and you can still love your pets after babies, but it no longer feels like a replacement child. I think you may change your mind about the dog once you\u2019re actually a father.", "Privately rehoming a dog with behavioral issues, especially biting, is nearly impossible if you\u2019re honest about those behavioral issues. Even if eventually successful it can take a long time to find someone who will take that dog. OP does not have that kind of time. It\u2019s over - for his family\u2019s safety, the dog has to go. And if he is responsible about doing his research, he\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s extremely unlikely a shelter will be willing to take the dog, or try to rehome it. With those kind of issues, unsolvable chemical issues, it\u2019s irresponsible. \n\nIf OP cares about his dog he\u2019ll hire an in home vet to come and put his dog down in comfortable surroundings. The alternative is the dog spends several weeks in a shelter being evaluated for behavior issues and then gets put down at the end anyways, by strangers, alone, and scared. He\u2019s about to be a father, he needs to adult up.", "I want to change my vote. I thought you were the wife. You are going to have to do something about the dog. Sorry.", "Are you mentally deficient? He's  already bitten your wife twice. He *will* bite your child. Not if, when. I hope the dog keeps you warm at night because you just lost your wife over it.", "That dog bites both you and your wife, people it knows.  \nAnd you're willing to risk it injuring a baby, someone the dog doesn't know, because you doubt it'll happen? That alone makes you TA.", "And what evidence are you basing that assumption on? Everything you have said clearly points that the likelihood is that the dog will bite the kid", "yes it will bro", "You should not be allowed to have a dog. Or a child. YTA.", "Why?", "Why?", "Yes it will. YTA OP.", "Not bitting but, picture life:\n\nHow does that look like?\n\n\u2014wife is preparing herself a quick bite while the baby is finally asleep. There\u2019s a sound on the monitor so she goes to check and when she gets back, the dog has jumped on the table and eaten her food.\n\n\u2014wife finally puts the baby to sleep, takes her time to pump, is exhausted and wakes to find shit and cat litter all over the floor.\n\n\u2014dog can find the newborn a novelty, get in the baby\u2019s tub? Chew some of his items or furniture?\n\n\u2014dog can escape while your wife is occupied with the newborn?\n\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think dog will bite (which c\u2019mon, there\u2019s evidence the dog will) you have to want a safer and more considerate environment for your wife and baby. She was compassionate enough to ask you to control the issues, re-homing is the nuclear option if you fail. This is reasonable", "Yes. It will. You do realize toddlers have no boundaries and get into everything. You baby will annoy your dog and your dog will bite. Rehome the dog before something horrible happens", "And there we have!\n\nYou\u2019re so much the asshole that you\u2019re willing to GAMBLE your CHILD\u2019S SAFETY on \u201cI doubt that will happen\u201d.\n\nTell us, what evidence are you placing your bet on?\n\nThe dog\u2019s docile nature?\n\nThe dog\u2019s history of obedience?\n\nThe dog\u2019s obvious affection for your wife?\n\nYTA. \n\nYour wife should stay with her mom. Knowing how you\u2019d willingly put her and your baby at risk, she\u2019d be a fool to come back to you. And downright negligent to allow you unsupervised visitation with her baby.", "So YTA + extremely obtuse", "That's just stupid.  Is your IQ like 40 or something?", "Is she working as a farm dog? Can you list her usual exercise/stimulation or enrichment routine?", "She BIT your wife and drew blood. That's AGGRESSIVE. Dude YTA. What's going to happen if the baby gets too close and she decides to have \"a boundary\"? No. You NEED to do what is right for your family and your child. This is not normal behaviour for a dog and it won't get better.", "You can't be serious with this comment!! A child can not control it's actions. She will touch the dog, pull her ears..Your dog will \"play\" with her or maybe really bite her as self defense. Or bite her because she is jealous. \nIf your wife lost a few droplets of blood this will mean your kid can loose a hand and will have scars in her face or will even die by \"one small bite\". If I would be your wife, I wouldn't trust you to be a responsible parent for a baby. I really hope you are a troll. Please google about damages a dog can do to a baby and a toddler and than think about your priorities. You will lose the dog or you will lose your wife.", "Your dog IS AGGRESSIVE. She growls, bites, and does not respond to training. Your going to bring a NEWBORN into your home?! Are you an insane person?! Absolutely YTA.", "That\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard of", "The dog enjoys car rides so I bring her everywhere with me, for the most part. Yes it's my first baby. Highly doubt my opinion will change however because my dog is like my kid already.", "Tap the three dots and hit \u2018edit\u2019 to change your vote", "We have a farm, yes. She has \"duties\" but generally has no interest in doing them unless I'm standing right there. As soon as I'm out of eye shot she becomes aggressive toward the animals (mainly chickens). She is outdoors all day rounding up the sheep and cattle. Whenever I go anywhere, she goes with me. But as I said, if I'm not right there watching her she will absolutely go after the animals for a kill. When indoors she has a bunch of stimulation mats as well.", "So you\u2019re saying your dog is more important?", "You are absolutely not ready to be a parent. I hope your wife will be willing to leave you if it becomes necessary to protect the baby."]}
