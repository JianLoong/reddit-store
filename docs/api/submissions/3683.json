He snorted and reluctantly got up and I learned from other classmates that he uses it when I'm not there for another course I'm not taking. I didn't care as long as I could use it when I needed it.\n\nYesterday though, I came in and found him sitting there once again. I go up to him and say excuse me. He looks at me and says what. I tell him I'm sorry that's my chair. He then says \"says who, what's your justification of this chair belonging to you\". I explained to him that it was approved by admin but he said you simply took it from the meeting room, it's public property and not your chair. He also said you don't look sick anyway and I also hate those regular chairs.\n\nI told him if he hated them, he should go get one and he told me no you go get one that's none of my business. I was so mad at his attitude and decided to complain to the TA. The TA asked him what's going on and he repeated to him what he said to me. So the TA turned to look at me and told me don't mind him just get a new chair, class will be starting soon.\n\nI then went out but didn't go to get another one, but told security someone was occupying my chair and wouldn't budge. So he came in with me and told him son, I'm gonna need you to get up from that chair. Classmate told him I'm not going anywhere and you can try to force me and see what happens. That's when TA comes up to us and tells security I already told her to get another one but and the problem would be solved but she wouldn't listen. Security then stared at him for a while, turned and stared at calssmate for a while, shook his head and told me wait here. He went and grabbed me a chair. \n\nTA told me I specifically asked YOU to get another chair. I retorted and told him but that's my chair and he said I know that's your chair. I told you to get another one and then you could have taken it to admin about what happened and not delayed class. He then went on a long tirade about how a smart engineer should know how to solve problems peacefully....etc etc\n\nI know that the problem would have been solved if i just got another chair but wouldn't it also have been solved if my classmate got up?

Maybe there's some misogyny there too.", "Its a chair brought in for them specifically, how is that entitlement bcuz they have a bad back, not like the jerk who took OP\u2019s chair who had no issues, now that\u2019s entitlement.", "In my experience, TAs are usually grad students who likely don't go through the same sensitivity training at professors do. Either way, they need to be told that they need to respect all accommodations.", "They do need training to understand they have legal requirements towards students with disabilities and maybe that would help going forward, but it's too bad that \"basic human decency\" wasn't enough. Training can solve the problem but the ultimate problem is that the TA is an AH.", "I assumed that was given. \n\nI assumed the OP was asking if OP was being an asshole to the TA or if the TA was being an asshole to the OP.\n\nThe fact that the student was being an asshole is more a fact in the story than an opinion.\n\nThe student was definitely being an asshole, the TA was potentially breaking laws by siding with the AH.", ">delayed for everyone because someone was crying about a chair.\n\nGreat way to minimize someone's medical issues. This isn't about something as simple and petty as preferred seating. OP has a medical condition that causes chronic pain and was being denied the accommodations that would minimize that pain.", "> It didn\u2019t achieve anything though did it? No one got punched in the nuts. The security guard just got another chair and the class was delayed for everyone because someone was crying about a chair.\n\nIt sure did. The guy didn't roll over the speedbump this time. The speedbump didn't have to get his own chair.\n\nAnd now the next time the asshat knows he's going to call security. 90% of dealing with asshats is making it clear you won't take their BS.", "They fucking better be. Dipshit.", "I don't disagree with that, but that doesn't make it \"protected\" and it doesn't mean the other student sitting in it or the school is suddenly breaking ADA. It would be a different situation if OP were granted a wheelchair accommodation and another student sat in it just for fun and wouldn't give it up.", "I don't disagree. OP has priority on it and the other student is an AH for not giving it up. That doesn't make it an ADA issue.", "Yes, correct. I'm going to reiterate this on every reply like this, but the other student is the AH here...but that doesn't mean ADA was somehow broken.", "What bothers me is how one can get to such a point of advanced learning and somehow have never picked up very basic almost HR-like knowledge that surround, y\u2019know, basic fucking human rights.

You have the material here to go to town, so please do.", "Accommodations look different for everyone, and they are not just for those with visible disabilities. The other student was an AH and should\u2019ve given up the chair, sure, but the TA was the bigger problem. As the instructor, it is his responsibility to ensure accommodations are being honored; his response should\u2019ve been to tell the other student to get another chair, not make it OP\u2019s problem.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an ADA issue or not. Once the uni grants accommodations, it becomes their responsibility to make sure they\u2019re being met.", "That's a different point than the one I was replying to.
