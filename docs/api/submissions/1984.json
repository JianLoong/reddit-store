Jodie lives with our parents, and a boyfriend [M26] who she's been seeing for a couple of months.\n\nIn early October, at one point, Jodie accused me of using the family computer in our parents' home to go on gambling websites and signing up with our mom's debit card while I was babysitting. I told Jodie that's not true at all and asked her why on earth she would think that.\n\nJodie explained that money was disappearing from our mom's bank account and that she checked the computer's browser history and that gambling websites came up.\n\nTo be honest, I was kind of offended that Jodie would think I'd do something like that. I've never had a gambling problem and I've never stolen from anyone. I told Jodie that that's awful but that it wasn't me who did it.\n\nShe didn't believe me and went and told a load of our extended family that I was apparently stealing our mom's money to go on gambling websites, and now they all think I'm a horrible person and many of them have blocked me on Facebook.\n\nAnyway, the next week, Jodie got back in touch with me. She said that she found a gambling website on her boyfriend's phone and connected the dots, and he admitted that it was him who was stealing our mom's money and going on gambling websites.\n\nHowever, Jodie refused to apologise to me for jumping to conclusions and basically ruining my reputation with our extended family. Sure, I never speak to them anyway, but it's still a terrible reputation to have especially when it's undeserved.\n\nJodie said that it's my own fault because apparently I \"acted guilty\" and said that I got too defensive when she accused me.\n\nLater in October was Jodie's birthday and she had a big party with our extended family. I decided to give Jodie her gifts a couple of days before, but refused to go to the party. I didn't want to go because I didn't want to deal with all the questions and judgement, and I was still really angry at Jodie for not even apologising for what she did.\n\nMy parents are understanding but Jodie said I'm an asshole for not attending her party and that if I'm going to be that way then I shouldn't bother being a part of the family, and accused me of being petty.", "created_utc": 1668107194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrolx2/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_birthday_party/", "score": 2159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were providing childcare for her, she put you on public blast for something you hadnt done and then still blamed you when the truth outed.\n\nSister or not, you don't need her in your life.", "NTA why on earth would you still give her presents??", "NTA for not going.  You are very much being TA to yourself for not putting the truth out there.  I hope you also put a stop to the babysitting.  Give Jodie one more chance to come clean to the family and apologize to you and if she still refuses then take steps yourself.", "NTA but you gave her presents? what? I wouldn't even want to see her again let alone give her presents. You are very forgiving and not giving her much of a consequence here. She's clearly learned nothing", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe you bought her birthday gifts.\nDid she dump her bf?", "NTA and I would be nc with Jodie until she tells your entire family who really was gambling and that she fucked up", "NTA Jodie\u2019s a dumbasshole", "Total NTA. Your sister needs to set the record straight with the family and apologise.", "Definitely NTA, and she should apologize to you for accusing you of something that her deadbeat thief boyfriend is doing, and should not only contact all of your family members and explain that she was wrong, but also tell them that it was actually indirectly her fault because it was her boyfriend, that she brought to the house that was actually the one stealing.\n\nHonestly though, I would go to the party, then when everyone is there, bring it up in front of the whole group and put your sister on blast in front of everyone so she has to explain the whole situation to the group and everyone will see who was really at fault.", "NTA - Accusing you once was one thing, but doubling down and telling the whole extended family that you did this (with no proof) is majorly AH behavior. Why would you even buy her presents after she acted that way? Are you still providing free child care? Because I would be telling her that if she thinks you're capable of stealing like that then surely she doesn't want you around her kid.", "NTA. Jodie, on the other hand, is. It was easier for her to let the rest of the family think it had been you stealing from your mom than facing the fact that she had living with her a thief and a man with gambling issues. She would not loose face with the family, so she let them still believe it had been you. On top of that, she berates you and accuses you of pettiness. I really can't believe it. I wouldn't have bought a single thing for her unless she apologizes: if she is unable to see how serious what she did to you was, it is a SHE issue, not a YOU issue. And maybe, go NC with her? She sounds toxic.", "NTA - your sister sure is and possibly your parents. Honestly I would go either low contact or no contact with your sister. She is sure quick to blame you for something you didn't do. I wonder what else she can blame you for.\nOh and then she is pretty much kicking you out of your family? What makes her in charge?\n\nQuestion. Do your parents know that you didn't do this? If so, haven't they stuck up for you? \nYou said that they are understanding, I'm assuming as to why you didn't go to your sister's birthday party. Yet they don't have you back at all? Couldn't they reach out to those extended family members and set them straight? \n\n\n>Jodie said I'm an asshole for not attending her party and that if I'm going to be that way then I shouldn't bother being a part of the family\n\nOh and they are okay with your sister pretty much kicking you out of your family?", "You are TA for giving her gifts.\n\nJodie wronged you, and she refuses to make it right. I would go NC with her until she apologizes publicly.\n\nYou are NTA for not going to the party, but you are TA to yourself for letting Jodie get away with this and enabling her to do worse next time.", "NTA - why are you giving her presents?!!!! That's ridiculous itself. She hasn't even apologized. Has she admitted to the rest of the family that her loser bf was the one stealing? Or does she not want him to look bad to the rest of them? It's ok for you to get crapped all over but not him? Have your parents cleared it up with your extended family? WTH is \"acting guilty? Honestly, your sister sucks.", "NTA\n\nPlease tell me you stopped the free babysitting until she clears your name.", "NTA\nJodie sucks", "NTA - Jodie sounds exactly like that person from that time and that place or the thing that I don\u2019t spend energy remembering.", "NTA. I would stop all the free babysitting until she tells everyone the truth and apologizes.", "NTA.  Why are you still in touch with her at all? I wouldn't be unless she posted a public confession to all of your family.  Wouldn't trust that she would not pull a stunt like this again.", "Yeah that\u2019s not ok what she did\u2026 refused to apologize when she learned the truth? WTH is wrong with her? I guess you can say at least she came forward to you with the truth but why she doesn\u2019t think an apology is necessary is beyond me and her excuse is terrible. She should be making it up to you and until she does, I think you are well within your rights to distance yourself. NTA", "NTA, she's not accepting responsibility for her actions and should at least apologize. \n\nBut the thing I don't get is...do you live at home too? If not, why would you go to their house to use a computer to gamble? If you do, it makes at least a little more sense, explanation, not excuse, but still not right to just accuse people without evidence.", "NTA.  Sister is entitled, not someone that should be trusted, and a red flag. NTA  \n\nDid she give anywhere near the same shit to her stealing bf tht she gave you?", "NTA:\nIf she was any kind of sister and cared about you at all she would use this party as an opportunity to admit to all the extended family that she accused you unjustly/falsely and sincerely apologizes to you for all the fall out.\nIf she can't do this then she is selfish and I would not babysit for her as she is only using you. I would NOT be buying her presents or even having contact with her or her boyfriend until they apologize publicly for the humiliation they have put you through. \n\nYour parents should have your back and insist that both your sister and her bf apologize.", "*Jodie, I am not going to allow you back into my life until you go to each and every family member and tell them that you made a mistake, that I didn't have a gambling problem, and that you are making amends for not believing your sister.  If you can't do that then you can't be a part of my life moving forward.*\n\nNTA", "NTA. Jodie sucks", "NTA. What a sweet forgiving sister you are to get her presents. I would have told her to F herself. ITs ridiculous that she automatically assumed it was you cause as soon as I read that someone was stealing and gambling I KNEW it was the boyfriend. You should ask your sister what about yalls lives together made her think you would be the one to steal. Of course you got defensive when she accused you! Who wouldnt?? And the fact that she refuses to apologize is doubling down on her shitty asshole behavior. Id tell her who wants to be a part of a family who jumps to conclusions about each other and refuses to apologize or believe each other?", "NTA. Jodie and her boyfriend are both giant assholes. I have no idea why you\u2019re buying her presents to doing anything to help her before she publicly apologizes and corrects herself to all of your family and everyone else.", "Well then Jodie can find herself a new babysitter.   NTA for avoiding her toxic behaviour.", "NTA\n\nWTF. She owed you a huge apology, plus she should have proactively reached out to all the people she gave bad info and explained what really happened.\n\nI'm amazed you haven't cut her out of your life.", "NTA. I wouldn't have even given her a present.", "NTA.   \nJodie was incredibly disrespectful to you - she questioned your morals, integrity and values...that is horrible. To appease or placate her in any way is giving her permission to continue to treat you like this. \n\nI am surprised you gave her gifts, without an apology I would not have spoken to her again (the apology would have been tip of the iceberg...she did a lot of damage). She had no problem telling everyone how untrustworthy, immoral and terrible you were, but cannot even take responsibility for her statements and the consequences for you. \n\n\\*And please say you are not watching her daughter anymore! If she has told your family, who knows what she has told your niece.", "NTA.\n\nWait, wait, wait... so, what is the likelihood any part of Jodi's story is true? Did she know the whole time it was her boyfriend but told everyone it was you as a way to keep her boyfriend around? Was the missing money even used on a gambling site or did Jodi just buy herself something nice and decide to make a story and make it your fault and knew her BF went to gambling sites so she thought she could use it as cover.\n\nWhy are you buying her gifts and taking care of her child? Stop all of that until 1. EVERYONE knows exactly how the charges got onto your mom's card and what they were for 2. Your sister apologizes to you and makes sure she made up the entire accusation. 3. If it was the boyfriend that did the charges that he is kicked out of the house.\n\nMy money is on Jodi using the card.", "NTA- Jodie sucks.", "NTA.  Did she text you, perhaps, once she found out it was her boyfriend?  She's refusing to undo the harm she has caused to you, so I'd say posting the text proof (if you have it) that it was her boyfriend is fair.", "NTA. I could\u2019ve connected the dots from a mile away that the new boyfriend was stealing money from your mom, not her own daughter. Honestly it sounds like she was trying to cover up for her boyfriend\u2019s gambling addiction more than anything. Her going to family to spread that seems a bit extra if she actually thought it was true. Also, the fact that she\u2019s not even trying to take it back or apologize but still expects you to be supportive is awful. She should\u2019ve used more common sense and investigated further until she had a real answer.", "I wouldn\u2019t even have given her a gift. NTA", "NTA But Jodie is one massive a-hole and i wonder why you give her presents", "NTA   but why are you wasting money on gifts for her?\n\nThis is when you go NC with her, until she tells everyone it was her dirtbag bf who was stealing your mother's money, then think about if you want someone in your life who treats you like this.\n\nYour parents also suck. Why aren't they talking to your relatives, and telling them what really happened?\n\nETA: stop watching her kids, or doing other helpful things, until she makes it right.", "NTA. \n\nMy petty ass would've gone to that party and made a toast to Jodie for (depending on which one's true) \"standing by / dumping her boyfriend and his gambling problem, and I know that she's deeply sorry for her false accusations. Here's to the birthday girl!\" \n\nYou're a better person than I am, OP.", "NTA But next time she has a party go and make a big announcement to clear your reputation. It will make her look bad, sure, but she did the same to you and you deserve to clear your name.", "NTA \nJodie sounds like a master manipulator but you sounds like a complete doormat. JC, this woman falsely accuses you of gambling and theft **w/o any proof**, slanders you to all your extended family, then refuses to apologize and make it right, and you\u2019re still buying her birthday gifts?! You\u2019re still in contact and taking her verbal abuse?! I don\u2019t get it. Why not set the record straight with everyone. If you have screenshots of her admitting it was her bf, share them with your family. And I wouldn\u2019t talk to her until she apologizes.

I would\u2019ve immediately told even sis is a liar and her stealing boyfriend was the issue. Also, stop doing favors and buying gifts for someone who clearly hates you.", "And how old is the child?  She sounds and thinks like she\u2019s maybe 13 at most.  Good lord.", "Why the heck did you get her anything? Why are you even speaking to her?", "NTA and Jodie seems to be quite a piece of work, lol. Did they (she and her stealing friend) even repay your mom? Don't give in and don't babysit for free anymore, it's about time for sis to learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA\n You should go and tell everyone what the bf did", "NTA. Why are you still helping her and giving her gifts? I find that so bizarre.", "Jodie is a Jupiter-sized A H. Id have been tempted to have gone to have brought up the whole saga in front of them all so she had to admit it, personally but she is horrid. To you, very unreasonable NTA", "You should go and put her shitty boyfriend on blast.", "NTA. Jodie is. She should be apologizing to you publicly. You are better than I am because I wouldn\u2019t have given her a present; nor would I babysit for her again.", "NTA: tell your parents that if Jodie refuses to clean up your reputation that she destroyed, then they need to do it, or you are going to look and see if there may be any legal options that you can take to sue her for slander.", "NTA  \nOutrageous.   \nPetty? You would be within your rights to go on a nuclear smear campaign by just blasting the TRUTH on social media. And she's calling YOU petty? WTAF????", "NTA. Your sister and even your parents are. Why aren't they clearing your name? Why are you still babysitting her child and giving her gifts? You are not good to yourself. She had the audacity to claim it was your fault she accused you because you were naturally offended, and of course, your feelings were hurt. \n\nIs your sister the golden child?", "> Jodie said that it's my own fault because apparently I \"acted guilty\" and said that I got too defensive when she accused me.\n\nAnd then you slapped her in the face, right? Hard?\n\nYour sister is a narcissist. Go NC ASAP.", "YTA for buying her presents. Go round the extended family and set them right.", "NTA - an AH move (and what'd I'd probably do tbh) would be showing up to the party with self help books for gambling addicts spouses to help her with her struggles after everything her husband did - granted I'd only do this if she didn't correct everything with the extended family that would be there that it was her BF - not you - who was a gambling thief. From the story it doesn't sound like she reached back out to everyone she shit talked you to? That would be an AH move. Sending genuine gifts and not coming yourself is the least AH move you could make. I'm not sure I'd ever talk to someone again if they accused me of that and lied to the whole family about it before confirming.", "Gifts?!\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Jodie and her boyfriend are utter arseholes and I wouldn't be babysitting anymore. No apology = limited contact and no gifts.\nStill seeing the boyfriend? She's an idiot too.", "NTA. She\u2019s really acting like she\u2019s got the moral high ground on this by calling you a petty AH, throwing out ultimatums and shit\u2026 no, SHE wronged YOU after all you did, and she\u2019s too cowardly and egotistical to own up to the family and apologize. You shouldn\u2019t have even gotten her a gift, and you should call her bluff on NC with her.", "INFO:\n  \nYou gave her *gifts?!?!?!?!*\n  \nAnd she hasn't yet made a public retraction?", "A dude she's known for 5 months has admitted to doing what you're accused of. Spread the word while pointing your giant finger, don't stop yelling it til everyone has heard you. Then go back to ignoring the extended fam as usual no loss to you", "I know! OP is an asshole to herself by continuing to let her sister walk all over her.", "I'd go to the party and announce to everyone that your sister wanted to do a big public apology to you, and then she's cornered. \"Hey family, it's so great to see all of you here. Sis said once everyone arrived she wanted to apologize to all of you, and myself, for lying and jumping to conclusions.  So here you go sis, the floor is yours.\" \n\nBut I'm petty.", "Maybe she needs to tell all the family members she was wrong and it was in fact her boyfriend. But she won\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t want everyone to hate him (I assume).", "Wait, are you still babysitting for free after the accusations?", "NTA. BUT I would not of bought her shit for her birthday other than maybe a book on properly apologizing when wrong; and I also would of went to the party JUsT to clear my name, letting every single person there know that she not only falsely accused, but refuses to take responsibility & apologize, and that it was in fact her boyfriend who stole your mom\u2019s money. What better way to reestablish your reputation and put your sister in her place?!", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nBut I'd have gone to the party just to announce my innocence and how ashamed i was of everyone who wrongfully judged me off baseless lies. Then called jodie out to confirm if i was lying now or not. \n\nIf i had to I'd have pulled the parents to speak on my behalf too..and if i really had to I'd go nuclear and dropped her bf right in it, but til that point I'd have kept his name out of it, just sought to clear mine.", "For him maybe but I'd like to point out she just showed she's willing to completely forgive him for stealing from your family, while you she'll drag through the mud completely, and never own up to being wrong.  Is that really the kind of person you want in your life who will defend their SO when they are committing criminal activity but will accuse you without proof and never even acknowledge wrongdoing?", "The parents too. I hope he\u2019s never allowed in  theirs house again. If he is, they\u2019re doormats too. Sister would be out of my life forever.", "Jodie doesn\u2019t want her new leech of a boyfriend to look bad but her doormat of a sister is okay. Your parents are just as bad for letting family believe this about you!", "I think Jodie is trying playing a long game in separating you from your parents will.\n\nShe and her gambling addict partner are booth still living with your parents. Her partner has already stolen from your parents. She\u2019s unwilling to reveal the truth about her boyfriend and wants to keep you out of the picture.\n\nRight now I\u2019m very afraid for your parents. The guy l, and possibly also Jodie, need to leave. \n\nAlso look into being made the POA for your parents. And change any passwords, get new cards for your parents as well.\n\nNTA", "> they were worried it was going to make me look worse and like they\u2019re enabling my fictional gambling addiction.\n\nWhat the hell? That makes no sense whatsoever. Your sister is a raging asshole, and your parents are, sorry, but cowards.\n\nI question whether Jodie ever really thought it was you - I mean, you don\u2019t live there, right? You have no history of gambling? I\u2019m wondering whether she was (intentionally or subconsciously) launching an attack on you to divert attention, so people wouldn\u2019t immediately draw the most obvious conclusion - that it was her bf.\n\nYou are obviously NTA, but I can\u2019t believe you gave your sister gifts! I hope you\u2019re not still babysitting for her\u2026 no more sisterly help until she publicly apologizes!", "Because we all know how hard it is to find penis that gambles with our mom's credit card. \n\nHow could she stand to lose such a winner?", "Why not have her apologize at the party OP. You bring it up. She deserves to eat crow.", "I would out Jodie and her boyfriend on Facebook. It would make sure that all Jodie's family kept their wallets close to their chest around him, and it would clear OP's name. Would it hurt OPs relationship with her sister? Yuppers, but if I were OP I would not give a shit at this point.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It's getting cold."]}
