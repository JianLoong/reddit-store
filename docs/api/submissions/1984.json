Jodie lives with our parents, and a boyfriend [M26] who she's been seeing for a couple of months.\n\nIn early October, at one point, Jodie accused me of using the family computer in our parents' home to go on gambling websites and signing up with our mom's debit card while I was babysitting. I told Jodie that's not true at all and asked her why on earth she would think that.\n\nJodie explained that money was disappearing from our mom's bank account and that she checked the computer's browser history and that gambling websites came up.\n\nTo be honest, I was kind of offended that Jodie would think I'd do something like that. I've never had a gambling problem and I've never stolen from anyone. I told Jodie that that's awful but that it wasn't me who did it.\n\nShe didn't believe me and went and told a load of our extended family that I was apparently stealing our mom's money to go on gambling websites, and now they all think I'm a horrible person and many of them have blocked me on Facebook.\n\nAnyway, the next week, Jodie got back in touch with me. She said that she found a gambling website on her boyfriend's phone and connected the dots, and he admitted that it was him who was stealing our mom's money and going on gambling websites.\n\nHowever, Jodie refused to apologise to me for jumping to conclusions and basically ruining my reputation with our extended family. Sure, I never speak to them anyway, but it's still a terrible reputation to have especially when it's undeserved.\n\nJodie said that it's my own fault because apparently I \"acted guilty\" and said that I got too defensive when she accused me.\n\nLater in October was Jodie's birthday and she had a big party with our extended family. I decided to give Jodie her gifts a couple of days before, but refused to go to the party. I didn't want to go because I didn't want to deal with all the questions and judgement, and I was still really angry at Jodie for not even apologising for what she did.\n\nMy parents are understanding but Jodie said I'm an asshole for not attending her party and that if I'm going to be that way then I shouldn't bother being a part of the family, and accused me of being petty.", "created_utc": 1668107194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrolx2/aita_for_not_going_to_my_sisters_birthday_party/", "score": 804, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were providing childcare for her, she put you on public blast for something you hadnt done and then still blamed you when the truth outed.\n\nSister or not, you don't need her in your life.", "NTA why on earth would you still give her presents??", "NTA for not going.  You are very much being TA to yourself for not putting the truth out there.  I hope you also put a stop to the babysitting.  Give Jodie one more chance to come clean to the family and apologize to you and if she still refuses then take steps yourself.", "NTA but you gave her presents? what? I wouldn't even want to see her again let alone give her presents. You are very forgiving and not giving her much of a consequence here. She's clearly learned nothing", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe you bought her birthday gifts.\nDid she dump her bf?", "NTA and I would be nc with Jodie until she tells your entire family who really was gambling and that she fucked up", "NTA Jodie\u2019s a dumbasshole", "Total NTA. Your sister needs to set the record straight with the family and apologise.", "Definitely NTA, and she should apologize to you for accusing you of something that her deadbeat thief boyfriend is doing, and should not only contact all of your family members and explain that she was wrong, but also tell them that it was actually indirectly her fault because it was her boyfriend, that she brought to the house that was actually the one stealing.\n\nHonestly though, I would go to the party, then when everyone is there, bring it up in front of the whole group and put your sister on blast in front of everyone so she has to explain the whole situation to the group and everyone will see who was really at fault.", "NTA - Accusing you once was one thing, but doubling down and telling the whole extended family that you did this (with no proof) is majorly AH behavior. Why would you even buy her presents after she acted that way? Are you still providing free child care? Because I would be telling her that if she thinks you're capable of stealing like that then surely she doesn't want you around her kid.", "NTA. Jodie, on the other hand, is. It was easier for her to let the rest of the family think it had been you stealing from your mom than facing the fact that she had living with her a thief and a man with gambling issues. She would not loose face with the family, so she let them still believe it had been you. On top of that, she berates you and accuses you of pettiness. I really can't believe it. I wouldn't have bought a single thing for her unless she apologizes: if she is unable to see how serious what she did to you was, it is a SHE issue, not a YOU issue. And maybe, go NC with her? She sounds toxic.", "NTA - your sister sure is and possibly your parents. Honestly I would go either low contact or no contact with your sister. She is sure quick to blame you for something you didn't do. I wonder what else she can blame you for.\nOh and then she is pretty much kicking you out of your family? What makes her in charge?\n\nQuestion. Do your parents know that you didn't do this? If so, haven't they stuck up for you? \nYou said that they are understanding, I'm assuming as to why you didn't go to your sister's birthday party. Yet they don't have you back at all? Couldn't they reach out to those extended family members and set them straight? \n\n\n>Jodie said I'm an asshole for not attending her party and that if I'm going to be that way then I shouldn't bother being a part of the family\n\nOh and they are okay with your sister pretty much kicking you out of your family?", "You are TA for giving her gifts.\n\nJodie wronged you, and she refuses to make it right. I would go NC with her until she apologizes publicly.\n\nYou are NTA for not going to the party, but you are TA to yourself for letting Jodie get away with this and enabling her to do worse next time.", "NTA - why are you giving her presents?!!!! That's ridiculous itself. She hasn't even apologized. Has she admitted to the rest of the family that her loser bf was the one stealing? Or does she not want him to look bad to the rest of them? It's ok for you to get crapped all over but not him? Have your parents cleared it up with your extended family? WTH is \"acting guilty? Honestly, your sister sucks.", "NTA\n\nPlease tell me you stopped the free babysitting until she clears your name.", "NTA\nJodie sucks", "NTA - Jodie sounds exactly like that person from that time and that place or the thing that I don\u2019t spend energy remembering.", "NTA. I would stop all the free babysitting until she tells everyone the truth and apologizes.", "NTA.  Why are you still in touch with her at all? I wouldn't be unless she posted a public confession to all of your family.  Wouldn't trust that she would not pull a stunt like this again.", "Yeah that\u2019s not ok what she did\u2026 refused to apologize when she learned the truth? WTH is wrong with her? I guess you can say at least she came forward to you with the truth but why she doesn\u2019t think an apology is necessary is beyond me and her excuse is terrible. She should be making it up to you and until she does, I think you are well within your rights to distance yourself. NTA", "NTA, she's not accepting responsibility for her actions and should at least apologize. \n\nBut the thing I don't get is...do you live at home too? If not, why would you go to their house to use a computer to gamble? If you do, it makes at least a little more sense, explanation, not excuse, but still not right to just accuse people without evidence.", "NTA.  Sister is entitled, not someone that should be trusted, and a red flag. NTA  \n\nDid she give anywhere near the same shit to her stealing bf tht she gave you?", "NTA:\nIf she was any kind of sister and cared about you at all she would use this party as an opportunity to admit to all the extended family that she accused you unjustly/falsely and sincerely apologizes to you for all the fall out.\nIf she can't do this then she is selfish and I would not babysit for her as she is only using you. I would NOT be buying her presents or even having contact with her or her boyfriend until they apologize publicly for the humiliation they have put you through. \n\nYour parents should have your back and insist that both your sister and her bf apologize.", "*Jodie, I am not going to allow you back into my life until you go to each and every family member and tell them that you made a mistake, that I didn't have a gambling problem, and that you are making amends for not believing your sister.  If you can't do that then you can't be a part of my life moving forward.*\n\nNTA", "NTA. Jodie sucks", "NTA. What a sweet forgiving sister you are to get her presents. I would have told her to F herself. ITs ridiculous that she automatically assumed it was you cause as soon as I read that someone was stealing and gambling I KNEW it was the boyfriend. You should ask your sister what about yalls lives together made her think you would be the one to steal. Of course you got defensive when she accused you! Who wouldnt?? And the fact that she refuses to apologize is doubling down on her shitty asshole behavior. Id tell her who wants to be a part of a family who jumps to conclusions about each other and refuses to apologize or believe each other?", "NTA. Jodie and her boyfriend are both giant assholes. I have no idea why you\u2019re buying her presents to doing anything to help her before she publicly apologizes and corrects herself to all of your family and everyone else.", "Well then Jodie can find herself a new babysitter.   NTA for avoiding her toxic behaviour.", "NTA\n\nWTF. She owed you a huge apology, plus she should have proactively reached out to all the people she gave bad info and explained what really happened.\n\nI'm amazed you haven't cut her out of your life.", "NTA. I wouldn't have even given her a present.", "NTA.   \nJodie was incredibly disrespectful to you - she questioned your morals, integrity and values...that is horrible. To appease or placate her in any way is giving her permission to continue to treat you like this. \n\nI am surprised you gave her gifts, without an apology I would not have spoken to her again (the apology would have been tip of the iceberg...she did a lot of damage). She had no problem telling everyone how untrustworthy, immoral and terrible you were, but cannot even take responsibility for her statements and the consequences for you. \n\n\\*And please say you are not watching her daughter anymore! If she has told your family, who knows what she has told your niece.", "NTA.\n\nWait, wait, wait... so, what is the likelihood any part of Jodi's story is true? Did she know the whole time it was her boyfriend but told everyone it was you as a way to keep her boyfriend around? Was the missing money even used on a gambling site or did Jodi just buy herself something nice and decide to make a story and make it your fault and knew her BF went to gambling sites so she thought she could use it as cover.\n\nWhy are you buying her gifts and taking care of her child? Stop all of that until 1. EVERYONE knows exactly how the charges got onto your mom's card and what they were for 2. Your sister apologizes to you and makes sure she made up the entire accusation. 3. If it was the boyfriend that did the charges that he is kicked out of the house.\n\nMy money is on Jodi using the card.", "NTA- Jodie sucks.", "NTA.  Did she text you, perhaps, once she found out it was her boyfriend?  She's refusing to undo the harm she has caused to you, so I'd say posting the text proof (if you have it) that it was her boyfriend is fair.", "NTA. I could\u2019ve connected the dots from a mile away that the new boyfriend was stealing money from your mom, not her own daughter. Honestly it sounds like she was trying to cover up for her boyfriend\u2019s gambling addiction more than anything. Her going to family to spread that seems a bit extra if she actually thought it was true. Also, the fact that she\u2019s not even trying to take it back or apologize but still expects you to be supportive is awful. She should\u2019ve used more common sense and investigated further until she had a real answer.", "I wouldn\u2019t even have given her a gift. NTA", "NTA But Jodie is one massive a-hole and i wonder why you give her presents", "NTA   but why are you wasting money on gifts for her?\n\nThis is when you go NC with her, until she tells everyone it was her dirtbag bf who was stealing your mother's money, then think about if you want someone in your life who treats you like this.\n\nYour parents also suck. Why aren't they talking to your relatives, and telling them what really happened?\n\nETA: stop watching her kids, or doing other helpful things, until she makes it right.", "NTA. \n\nMy petty ass would've gone to that party and made a toast to Jodie for (depending on which one's true) \"standing by / dumping her boyfriend and his gambling problem, and I know that she's deeply sorry for her false accusations. Here's to the birthday girl!\" \n\nYou're a better person than I am, OP.", "NTA But next time she has a party go and make a big announcement to clear your reputation. It will make her look bad, sure, but she did the same to you and you deserve to clear your name.", "NTA \nJodie sounds like a master manipulator but you sounds like a complete doormat. JC, this woman falsely accuses you of gambling and theft **w/o any proof**, slanders you to all your extended family, then refuses to apologize and make it right, and you\u2019re still buying her birthday gifts?! You\u2019re still in contact and taking her verbal abuse?! I don\u2019t get it. Why not set the record straight with everyone. If you have screenshots of her admitting it was her bf, share them with your family. And I wouldn\u2019t talk to her until she apologizes.
