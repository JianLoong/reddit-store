That\u2019s not a healthy relationship.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds toxic af, I been in those situations dude, it never ends well.

Can see this has already been commented but I'll say as well.. you're experiencing THIS much drama only 3 months in? That's a sign pal. Easier said than done but might be time to cut your losses as it doesn't read like the two of you are very compatible. But maybe you two can work things out. \nBut anyway, liking your friends Insta photo isn't a big deal.", "NTA You guys are fairly new to this relationship. However it does seem like she\u2019s really insecure and she has to work through that. My advice would be to sit down and have a conversation about likes and dislikes. Personally I don\u2019t agree with stalking social media to the point where my likes are being scrutinized.", "NTA\n\nShe's psycho. Ditch her.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is indeed quite controlling and she is very insecure. OP, you need sit her down and have a frank talk with her.  If she respects your feelings, she would not be sending angry texts over your friend's bikini picture. Good grief, OP, she is already displaying red flags. I would seriously reevaluate this relationship and break up with her if this continues, because it will only get worse if you don't put a stop to this immediately.", "INFO - Have you ever been romantically involved with the girl in the bikini?\n\nIf your girlfriend liked a guy friend of hers' shirtless thirst trap, you wouldn't think anything of it?", "OP,\n\n(Revised on new information OP shared below)\n\nNTA, but there needs to be a boundaries discussion on what is and is not acceptable behavior while dating.  Just because something doesn\u2019t bother you doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t bother the other person.  You don\u2019t have to agree with your partner\u2019s POV, but you do need to take them into consideration.\n\nBased on what you shared below, she is holding you to a different standard than she is for herself.\n\nOne thing that might help you both is looking at emotional validation to understand how to communicate your feelings when you\u2019re hurt or bothered without criticizing the other person. \n\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-emotional-validation-425336", "If you want to stay in a committed relationship with this girl, you need to take her feelings into account. If she doesn\u2019t like you liking other girls bikini photos, you need to talk to her about it, and come to an understanding. A lot of people are saying she\u2019s controlling, but really she is setting up a boundary (in an immature way but still). He can have the boundary that he is allowed to like other girls bikini photos; but that would mean they\u2019d have to break up, as their desires don\u2019t match and they can\u2019t respect each others feelings. Wanting things to be a certain way and not settling for less than your standard (in this case the girlfriends standard being that he doesn\u2019t like bikini photos) is not controlling. Forcing someone to maintain your standard is controlling. This issue will be solved by talking, though it may end in a break up.", "NTA. The girl you\u2019re dating is controlling and by her own words \u201cinsecure\u201d.

This is also my first ever real, serious relationship. We\u2019ve had a few major arguments before, made up, but established that we\u2019re two very people in relationships; where I\u2019m very laid back, almost to a fault, she\u2019s very controlling, and in her own words, insecure. \n\nI\u2019ve felt for a while that she doesn\u2019t trust me, and often when she\u2019s angry at me for something I\u2019ve done I\u2019d find it difficult to see her side because it\u2019s something that would never, bother me, e.g. having a best friend of the opposite gender (I\u2019ve practically been had cut off my female best friend bc my gf wasn\u2019t comfortable with her and how close we were)\n\nI\u2019ve gone away for a few days and a couple nights ago we fell out over text and later a phone call. We then didn\u2019t talk for the rest of the next day, until at around 12 at night a receive an angry text from her out of the blue.\n\nIn it is an angry \u2018what the fuck is this?\u2019 Followed by a screenshot of a photo of one of my friends in a bikini that I had liked a few hours ago on instagram. I\u2019d like to clarify that when I liked this photo it didn\u2019t even cross my mind that  this would upset her or was wrong to do, after all it wouldn\u2019t ever bother me if I had seen she had done the same. This was followed by \u2018so you\u2019re liking bikini pics just because we\u2019re in an argument?\u2019\n\nSo AITA for not feeling remotely sorry or remorseful for doing so? I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s upset but I cannot for the life of me understand how what I\u2019ve done is wrong. \n\nThanks! xxx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Relationships have arguments, but it's been three months, why are y'all arguing so much??", "u shouldn't be liking bikini pictures especially since she obviously doesn't like that its basic respect of boundaries", "Hey OP, I want you to know that your girlfriend's behaviour isn't healthy. I know it's your first serious relationship so it might be confusing to figure out what is normal or okay when it is all so new. I wish when I was your age that I got some wisdom from some older folks letting me know that if you're getting that feeling in your gut where you feel anxious about why your partner got angry or you describe a partner as controlling YOU to control their insecurities or isolating you from friendships, that this is wrong and not how relationships should go. Your girlfriend may be lovely in other ways, but she doesnt have the skills for a serious romantic relationship right now. Be careful about molding yourself around her anger-- you may one day find yourself as a person you dont recognize and always watching for her mood.

The best thing you can do is not feed into it, just tell her \"this is how it's going to be and there will be no compromise\" then go about your life with your friend doing whatever.

It will get worse. You will lose most of your friends. First you stop seeing your friends who are girls.

She sounds truly exhausting and your personalities are just like completely incompatible. I wish you the best of luck finding someone you can actually get on well with for a long time.\n\nYTA - For cutting off your friend. That's a friendship you need to get back and make right again. Never give up a bestie for someone new to your life. It's always a bad idea.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t how relationships have to be.

YTA for cutting off one of your friends for a 3 month relationship.", "Bro I didn't even finish this, lose this person, reestablish your friendship and apologize to her, I've been there before and you will always regret losing your friends for a bad gf.\n\nYou will not marry this girl, things will not get better, and you should break up ASAP, the sooner the better.", "ESH", "NTA Liking other girls pics is a huge no no. On social media, people will like pics as a way of getting the other person's attention (not saying that you are doing this) so liking a picture is not as innocent as it may seem. Typically though, you will not have a lot of luck in having a close friend of the opposite sex and this may create issues is not only this relationship but future ones as well. I don't think you had malicious intent in liking the picture, but hopefully now you know why this is an issue", "JFC. She sounds exhausting. \n\nNTA", "Never once been remotely romantically involved with the friend. She pushed me to become distant with my best friend because my gf was convinced she was into me (which she evidently wasn\u2019t, as all our friend group agreed). \n\nIt genuinely wouldn\u2019t bother me in the slightest if I saw her like a male friend\u2019s thirst trap/topless pic, because I trust her and it\u2019s not a random person, they\u2019re friends.\n\nI\u2019d also like to add that she is still currently friends with a guy she slept with a few times before, and will actually be living with in a flatshare (with 6 other people) in a few months. I\u2019m also friends with him, but regardless I find it a bit hypocritical of her to act like this despite her friendship with this guy. I trust her though, and it doesn\u2019t bother me and I\u2019ve never once mentioned it or even alluded to it being a problem", "This here is some real mental gymnastics. I\u2019m guessing if the roles were swapped and a girl liked a pic of a guy and he got this pissed about it you\u2019d tell her to leave him because he\u2019s a controlling misogynist. I disagree completely that this is OPs fault. But I do agree that this is in all likelihood a doomed relationship.", "OP,\nWith this additional information, I\u2019d revise my comment and now say NTA.  If it\u2019s okay for her to have relationships with exes but you can\u2019t with female friends, then there are different standards in the relationship and you\u2019re NTA.", "Why is she allowed to have a male friend and you aren't? This will be your entire life with her. I doubt it will change. Is this how you want to live?", "Do you tend to like your friend's pics? You're NTA and your girlfriend is being dramatic and controlling but you may or may not have committed a bit of a faux pas. If you don't normally like your friend's photos and you've liked this one bikini pic it does look a bit flirtatious but if you normally like her pics because that's a normal thing that friends do then you're completely in the clear.\n\nFYI your girlfriend admitting her problems does not make them any more acceptable. Admitting to toxic traits and then acting like you can't complain about those traits because they've been honest with you is a very common thing toxic people do.", "Is this the first time she's ever brought up you liking other girls' pics?", "Not really.\n\nA while ago she got mad at me for liking someone\u2019s pic but that was because she had seen it after I hadn\u2019t replied to one of her texts in an argument, but that\u2019s the closest thing.", "You're NTA here.  It sounds very much like you said in your post, you are two **very** different people in relationships.\n\nYou guys are still fresh, and thankfully you're well aware of how these compromises are affecting you... if it gets too much, you know what you need to do.\n\nAlso, what you brought up about your girlfriend's flatshare fling friend **is** a bit hypocritical. Keep not mentioning it though... you've got a solid unshakably secure vibe going, don't lose that."]}
