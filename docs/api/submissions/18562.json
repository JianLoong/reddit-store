I am grateful that I could marry the love of my life,but with the wedding almost everything went wrong.(Husband and I were paying for every fee, the wedding was not a gift from the parents)\nI wanted to wear white vans to the wedding because I never been a girly girl,so she made fun of me,\u201dwomen who are pairing gowns with sneakers are just making themselves looking dumb\u201d. Then she got mad and confronted us for not inviting this and that person but why inviting that another one. I wanted to bake the desserts,but she went ahead and ordered desserts from here and there,the same happened with the menu,she tried to change it because it wasnt to her liking. \nIn my country we don\u2019t wear white and red to other couples wedding due to traditions, because the bride changes from white into a red gown at midnight. MIL of course wanted to wear a red long lace gown to our wedding because i quote \u201cred is a passionate color and it brings everybodys attention\u201d We tried to talk to her, that red might not be the best idea, but she got mad at us again and said she never heard about this tradition and we are being mean to her. I dont have a father so we figured I could sit with my husband during the festivities, but she got mad again, and demanded to sit at our table too, because she is not just a regular guest, if she can\u2019t sit at the \u201chead table\u201d, then she won\u2019t attend the wedding at all. \nAt this point I was so sad and cried so much because I felt like it was not even our own wedding, I wanted to call off the whole wedding but my husband somehow managed to talk to her so she choose a long royal blue gown instead of the red! \nA year and a half passed, thought i was overreacting, maybe she was just trying to help on her own way. Last week she called my husband on the phone and had a question for me too, so he put her on the speakers and then she asked if her other daughter in law could wear my red wedding gown for a wedding as a guest (we are also invited to this wedding) i was completely lost for words, my husband replied noway instead of me, and guess what, she got mad again. \n\nIn the meantime, I got pregnant with our first baby, actually we have 2 days left, we are so excited! Husband and I thought it might be a good idea to spend a week or so with the baby, just the three of us to get used to the feeling of being a real family. MIL said she wants to come and visit immediately after the baby borns. Well i do not want that..neither my husband. MIL cried, and confronted my husband because she thinks it is my idea only and I don\u2019t want her to see her grandson and it is cruel towards her. Now i feel mad at her for trying to arrange not just the wedding but our whole lives and making not just me but her own son sad and uncomfortable too. \nAITA? Or should I just discuss it with my husband to let her stay for the first few days?", "created_utc": 1685454160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vqppq/aita_for_not_letting_mil_have_everything_under/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
