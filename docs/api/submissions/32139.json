I was a college student and working full time, so we agreed when the baby was born I would quit my job and focus on baby and finishing my degree (Nursing Student). Once I graduated, we would move back to my hometown (3 hours away) where I would support our family while he re-established his business. Then we would settle down, buy a home, and have more kids. In the meantime, we would stay put in our current small town with his small business. Very important here - I am not and have never been a fan of this small town. I am vocal about this. I only moved here because we clearly agreed it would be temporary ; we would move once I graduated.\n\nI\u2019ve upheld every part of the plan that involved me. I gave up my good job, stayed home, started nursing school and I am set to graduate next year! \nMy husband on the other hand has changed his mind. He no longer wants to move. He says he is comfortable in his current job and this area. When I expressed my feelings, he shuts me down with \u201cDon\u2019t be childish, you\u2019re only being negative Nancy, find something to be happy about, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t find happiness here, etc\u2026\u201d\nI just don\u2019t like it here. We have 0 involvement from his family. My family was SO excited we would be closer to them, and I was so excited to have a support system again. I told my husband that I don\u2019t think I can have more children while so far from support, so now he says we will simply not have more.  \nI\u2019m crushed, sad, even a little angry. I put so much into making this plan work. He never even told me he changed his mind, I found out through conversations with acquaintances. \nThe best compromise I\u2019ve gotten is we move a few minutes away so our kid can be in a decent school system. I will graduate and then be the breadwinner. He wants to jump immediately to buying a house and getting himself a nice truck. I feel almost played. I\u2019m just simply not happy with this new arrangement, but I feel guilty like I\u2019m in the wrong for feeling this way. \nSo tell me honestly, AITA?", "created_utc": 1701468128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188nqmv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_stay_in_a_location_we/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
