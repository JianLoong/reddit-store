Once I graduated, we would move back to my hometown (3 hours away) where I would support our family while he re-established his business. Then we would settle down, buy a home, and have more kids.

I only moved here because we clearly agreed it would be temporary ; we would move once I graduated.\n\nI\u2019ve upheld every part of the plan that involved me. I gave up my good job, stayed home, started nursing school and I am set to graduate next year! \nMy husband on the other hand has changed his mind. He no longer wants to move.

I put so much into making this plan work. He never even told me he changed his mind, I found out through conversations with acquaintances. \nThe best compromise I\u2019ve gotten is we move a few minutes away so our kid can be in a decent school system. I will graduate and then be the breadwinner. He wants to jump immediately to buying a house and getting himself a nice truck. I feel almost played.

He doesn't care that you two made life plans together, or that you're going to suffer now as a result. \nYou can't trust what he says anymore. \n\nI know it's easier said than done but you should really move back. See if your family can help. Don't share finances with this man, whatever you do.  Make an exit plan, save up and get out while you can!", "Yep, she can just stick to the plan: buy a house near her family and move there.\n\nHe can get onboard or not.", "Nta just finish school and then move and get divorced", "NTA.  Your husband doesn\u2019t get to make unilateral decisions that effect all of you unless you let him.  It sounds like he was hoping to baby trap you into agreeing to whatever he wanted because he thinks you won\u2019t leave him now that you have a child and are \u201csettled.\u201d  Don\u2019t let him get away with it, and for god\u2019s sake, make sure your birth control method is something he can\u2019t tamper with.  Or better yet, tell him you won\u2019t be sleeping with him until he\u2019s willing to reconsider sticking to the original plan.", "Graduate and you and child move back to your hometown. Tell him he is welcome to come to but, you are sticking with your agreed on plan.\n\nNTA", "Agree. OP, separate your finances BEFORE you become the primary breadwinner; if he uses your pay to proceed with a new house and truck, you'll never have any leverage to leave.", "It does \u201cwell\u201d according to LCOL area standards. I would make a little more as a new grad nurse.", "He's unilaterally changed the plan. There is no reason OP needs to. She can move back. He might move back with her, he might not.\n\nIn moving back, she's not abandoning him, she's simply following thru on their original commitment. If he chooses not to accompany her, it will be him, not her, breaking the commitment. At which point she can decide on a separation and possible divorce.\n\nBut again, in keeping to the original plan, she is not abandoning him. She's holding him to his commitment. If he does not move it is he, not she, who has failed.", "The cold part is, he probably never fully agreed and just said yes to appease OP. I think if he\u2019s allowed to make decisions on his own, I think OP needs to start applying for jobs in her hometown and make the move. When you have kids, a support system is absolutely necessary. And being a nurse, I\u2019m sure there are way more opportunities there. So go for it.", "New plan:  divorce.", "Better to get the divorce before she has income if she\u2019ll be the breadwinner.  Otherwise he\u2019ll get a quarter of that nursing salary.", "And no joint accounts for your finances. Keep your money in a separate account, in a separate bank, in the town where you want to live. Triple up on the birth control in case he gets sneaky.", "I should probably clarify on the truck part: he doesn\u2019t want me to directly purchase him a truck. He\u2019s always dreamed of having a nice decked out truck (40k probably minimum.) He currently has a basic model truck we bought less than a year ago. He plans, after I graduate, to upgrade to his dream truck. I struggle with feeling obligated to purchase the truck because he has spent the last couple years paying my car note, and my car will be paid off soon. \nI\u2019m not really sure if this explanation makes it better or worse.", "I expressed that I wanted to go to therapy alone, he said he wouldn\u2019t pay for it (my parents stepped in and offered to pay).\nI asked for couples therapy, and he refused.", "If she\u2019s thinking of divorce, it\u2019s better to do it before she\u2019s the breadwinner. \n\nWhy do I feel like he doesn\u2019t give two shits if she leaves him? Because he\u2019s planning on getting custody, child support, and alimony. \n\nHe\u2019s playing the long game.", "Your last line actually brought tears. Thank you.", "I\u2019d suggest not telling him because I wouldn\u2019t trust him not to try to stop her. She should make her plans and inform him afterwards. Once she is settled and has a stable home with a family support system in place, she will be in a stronger position legally if this turns into a custody battle.", "He refuses. I\u2019ve asked before.", "She should get a consult with an attorney before she makes any financial decisions if she\u2019s thinking of leaving. \n\nHer becoming the breadwinner could mean she pays him alimony. Buying more assets will make the process much more complicated. If she leaves, she should do it before he shutters his business, buys a truck, or a different house with the crazy loan rates and slower sales.", "Wow, your last paragraph is almost exactly his thought process in our conversations - \u201cwhy ruin a good thing?\u201d", "He\u2019s also a youngest child\u2026 I don\u2019t know that he knows what it\u2019s like to not get his way.", "I would understand a little more if he slowly changed his mind, and came to me with valid reasons. But he tried to hide it under the excuse of \u201cnot wanting to cause conflict\u201d because he knew it would upset me. I guess he just planned to not mention it and hope I would eventually forget that we were supposed to move?", "I have maintained a separate bank account and credit card!", "If you're outpacing him as a newly minted nurse in a LCOL area, it isn't that successful of a business by the most generous interpretations. I'd look at relocating back to your support network.", "If you are considering divorce it\u2019s best you do it before you get your new job that pays more, you don\u2019t need to be paying him alimony when he\u2019s the one who blew up your life/plans. He can pay for his own shiny new truck with his successful business money.", "> If they divorce, can't a judge rule that she can't move away with their child?\n\nYes, this is why it\u2019s important for her to move before filing for divorce.", "There\u2019s a child involved unfortunately. Usually you can\u2019t move a significant distance without court approval", "Thank you for your kind words\u2764\ufe0f", ">She finished a Ph.D (!!) and he decided he wasn\u2019t going to move. She could apply for jobs but he wouldn\u2019t follow. She did. He didn\u2019t. They\u2019re divorced.\n\nWhat did that dummy expect? That his ex-wife, who had poured years into her career and her scholarship, would be like, \"You know what? Being your wife and centering your location is *so much more important* to me than this thing that's consumed most of my adult life!\"\n\nImagine actually thinking that!", "He doesn't need a new truck then. He just got one less than a year ago. This whole situation has been about what he wants, and he expects you to keep doing everything he wants. You are not obligated to buy the truck. That's nice that he paid your car note. But as the breadwinner, you'll be paying for a lot more than just the truck. I think he wants the house and the truck to make it a lot harder for you to move. If you buy the truck now, you'll have a lot less money to save and pay for other bills. And a new house AND a new truck are too much when you're still starting out in your career. I know that nurses can earn a lot, but you shouldn't be spending too much too soon. Do not make any big purchases if you're still considering moving. And don't let him insult you into doing what he wants. Good luck. I hope things get better for you. ETA: even if he technically pays for the truck himself, that means he'll expect you to make an even bigger financial contribution to everything else.", "Do not feel obligated. You quit your job and adapted your life over an agreement you had with him. He went back on the agreement, belittled your justified feelings. He keeps manipulating you. You cannot 'play fair' with a person like that. You have to play to win. You have to play all the cards you have. Like NOT putting your money for his truck.", "\"I struggle with feeling obligated to purchase the truck...\"\n\nWhy? He didn't struggle with feeling obligated to pay for your therapy.", "You wouldn't need him to pay if you were not pregnant and still working.", "He clearly has no remorse for his behavior or any desire to improve your relationship. I understand that you may want to keep the family together for your child, but this man does not have your best interests at heart and concealed his true intentions from you. So, please consult with a divorce attorney and take the appropriate steps to protect yourself!", "If you are in the United States a lot of schools offer limited counseling services cheap or through your student fees.", "This alone would be enough for me to leave. He\u2019s not willing to do anything to help you be happier that will inconvenience him.", "Well, there is your answer right there. It will always be his way or the highway.\n\nI know which one I would choose - I'd take the highway with my kid right to my parents door. With a little planning beforehand and without letting him know until it was done.", "It may be a good thing for him, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for you. \n\nHe has no flexibility and no respect for you or your needs. That doesn\u2019t look likely to change. You need to look out for you and your baby.", "Well if you have any sense, he's about to.", "That doesn\u2019t do it.  File for a separation of assets.  You are responsible for his debts.", "Yes, but she has been the primary parent, will have a great job and a support system in place. Her case will be strong, especially if she is smart about finances, moves first, and has a job lined up.", "If she doesn't divorce him, it's less of a problem. She should just move.", "Is 3 hours a \"significant distance\" though? That depends country to country", "That\u2019s definitely a top fear.", "Talk to a lawyer. But currently there is no custody agreement and both of you have the ability to do what you want with your kid. It is a great flaw, and might be frowned upon by a judge. But legally as a parent with no custody agreement you can take your kid where you want.\n\nTalk to a lawyer though. Do not tell your husband your plan."]}
