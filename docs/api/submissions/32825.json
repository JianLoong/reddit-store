A lot of vets are not sufficiently trained in diagnosis or care of sick guinea pigs and most people would let a pig die rather than get treatment. One of mine has a mass in her abdomen, a consult, 2 xrays and painkillers just set me back 300 EUR. I'm fine with it because I keep a savings pot for vets bills, but treatment for exotics is expensive. Also you can't keep them alone, they need a friend, or a small group, it's cruel otherwise. \n\nUnfortunately guinea pigs are seen as disposable and are frequently dumped outside where they cannot survive, or given away for free where snake owners snatch them up for free food for their snake.  I am a guinea pig foster for a local shelter, I look after pigs when the shelter is full, and with the current economic situation there are hundreds of pigs being surrendered just in my province, it's heartbreaking.

My issue is, great she will have purchase money and initial start up, but what about long term?\n\nI feel awful because I imagine the divorce must be very stressful on them, and she's looking at the guinea pig as comfort, but she also has the other pets I feel.

Like if I demanded a guinea pig and nothing else, they would have gotten me a guinea pig stuffed toy, guinea pig t-shirt, everything guinea pig *except* an actual guinea pig.\n\nYou'd be NTA if you got her nothing and you can tell your sister that tou will not support the purchase of an animal as a present (good for you btw, full support from this internet stranger). But if you DO get her something, get something that's so generic that it could have been bought from a hundred different stores, take off the tag, and no receipt.

Getting a pet right before moving (when you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re moving) is never a responsible choice. It\u2019s very stressful for the pet.

I still think gifting her a book would be a good way to go.

I'm hopeful that if she does end up getting a guinea pig, she will do the right thing and get two, and make sure she provides proper care", "For sure! And thank you for checking me while being civil. :)", "This is a good idea! I didn't want to give extra context that might create too much bias in my favour, but it does weigh on my mind a lot. I really like the book on care", "Have a conversation with her. *\u201dHey! I heard you wanted a Guinea Pig. Here\u2019s what I know since I used to have one myself.\u201d*\n\nI don\u2019t know if you saw my other comment but this could be done as a cute, free consultation with a Guinea Pig expert. \ud83d\ude09 That and I\u2019d like to imagine that hearing from you will help her with the divorce of her parents.
