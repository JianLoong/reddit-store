She chose to exclude you from her life for years. She only wanted you there as a backup when here \"real\" father disappointed her again.", "NTA. This is not just about you. It's also about the rest of the family, whom she cut out of the wedding. She should have invited her brothers and your parents, and at the very least had both you and bio-dad walk her down the aisle. Telling you point blank that you'd be the back up was a slap in your face. It was a good idea to take your sons on vacation and make up for a little bit of the disappointment all of you must have felt. She needs to realize that you're not an on-demand backup parent.", "NTA. An invitation is not a binding contract, you were under no obligation to go to the wedding of someone who really hasn't spoken to you in a few years prior to this.", "NTA and not your responsibility. She'd already cut you out of her life for years. If she knew her bio father was flaky, it was her responsibility to get an understudy for his role in the wedding. You didn't have to volunteer, and taking your family for a vacation was the best way to make it clear that you were not available for the role. Hope Disney was enjoyed by all!", "NTA, and you did an awesome thing for the boys and your parents. SD sounds just as manipulative as her bio dad.

You weren't obligated to be her backup plan.", "NTA in my pov.\n\nFrom your words she clearly does not see you as a father of some kind. \nEven tho you cared for her in every aspect like a father would for a long time.\n\nTo me she sounds like a troubled person.\nShe dumped you/cut you and her own brothers after her mom died,that means from my experience at least, things nice or normal she ever did where mostlikely because of her pleasing her mom. And acting upon expectations from her surroundings. Sounds to me like she might needs some professional help.", "NTA she decided years ago to go NC with you.", "Absolutely NTA.  She made her decisions clear as to who was important to be at her wedding and you took second spot as always.  You had RSVP a firm No.  She disrespect your parents and excluded her own brothers without a second thought.  She had already cut off ties so should have had zero expectations.  Her and her family should take it up with her bio dad and leave you out of it as she has been doing all along.", "NTA Wow. No offence but your step daughter is the worst. She cuts out you, your parents who have been part of your life for 20 years? The grandparents and brothers don't make the cut to her wedding.  That's a special kind of ruthless.  The child free part of the wedding doesn't apply to siblings.  You did the right thing by not going. No one deserves to be an after thought or not a thought at all.  Oof.", "NTA, respond on social media that she made a point of kicking you out of her life after her mom passed. Let them know that her brothers and step grandparents were not invited.

The apple didn't fall far from the tree it seems. I'm terribly sorry for experiencing something this heartbreaking but you did well for yourself and your kids!", "NTA. Although I suspect her reason for cutting you off was related to her shitty father (trauma bonding is a bitch) you\u2019re not obligated to be the saviour all the time. If she won\u2019t help herself, you can\u2019t force her; you\u2019re more than allowed to live your life.", "NTA. Having a deadbeat dad messes with your self-esteem no matter who else is in your life so I have some empathy for her. But she's an adult and knows that actions have consequences. She should also know that cutting someone out of your life means you don't get to contact them when you need something. She needs to grow up.", "NTA. She should have just walked herself down the aisle. She knew bio father was a flake/no show before. What a drama queen.", "NTA; Karma is real, and she finally got a taste of it from the blatant disrespect she has shown to you, your parents and your sons when you all have been NOTHING but good to her all those years.", "NTA. I will say that when I read the title of your post, I was definitely ready to call you the asshole but after reading through the entirety of it I would say NTA and your stepdaughter is a spoiled brat.", "NTA.", "NTA.

You already responded that you weren\u2019t going to her wedding.", "NTA. Father's story sounds like bullshit, there's plenty of cross country flights he could have made. Or drive + fly from a different airport. Or you know, don't plan to take a must-make flight for your daughter's wedding; lots of other things can go wrong, not just forest fires. All sounds like bullshit tbh. You can feel sorry for her wedding turning out poorly, but you don't need to be sorry for your actions.\n\nIf you actually want to have a relationship with her, gently mention that you didn't feel like she actually wanted you there and you weren't really interested in being a back-up; you didn't do it out of spite, rather genuinely didn't feel like she wanted you there.

Btw - I really can\u2019t believe that she didn\u2019t invite her own *brothers* to her wedding. Child-free wedding or not\u2026siblings are usually the exceptions. Your wife must be rolling over in her grave. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and how shitty your stepdaughter has treated you.", "NTA She didn't invite her half brothers to her wedding? To me, a child-free wedding would exclude little kids, maybe under 10 who would be bored and run riot. Not her own teenager and almost teenager brothers.
