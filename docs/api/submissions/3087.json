I have no issue with my child spending so much time with them, it just saddens me that my ex refuses to be a part of it.", "I am an amazing parent. How dare you talk to a stranger that way. It seems like YOU were raised by bad parents with that kind of attitude.", "No. I am going to ask where they want to live.  \n\n\nI would never take my kid away from my ex fully. But currently? They share a bedroom, at her parent's small apartment. My kid has their own bedroom at my place. I want them to have the option of doing so. And knowing my ex, that will unfortunately mean I will have to take it to court.", "We already have joint custody. We were forced into an agreement because of a rouge grandparent filing for visitation rights.", "I mean\u2026 I feel your pain because I have kids. My daughter brought home first covid and then the flu within the span of the past month. It was my birthday Monday and I spent it crying because financially its screwed me, I own a small business and now can\u2019t pay the rent there or on our home. I don\u2019t have anyone else to \u201cpawn\u201d\u2019 my kids off on so I literally have them all day every day each and every day. What I don\u2019t get is how you think your ex is less deserving of being able to take care of their bills or reducing their risk of getting sick. It sounds like what they are asking you to do is take them during your time to have them while they have had them throughout the week. Which sounds pretty damn fair if you ask me, YTA", "What do you mean constantly? You mean the two days a week you\u2019re supposed to have the kids?", "I don\u2019t believe that for a second \ud83d\ude02", "Yes, you also stated that you both (foolishly) do not go by the legal custody agreement. If you DID, they you would not be TA but you don't, so you are.   \n\n\nAccept your damn judgement, and take care of your kid during your agreed upon time to do so.", "You said in another post this was your scheduled time.", "I won\u2019t yell at you at all. I sound unsympathetic and my judgment of this specific action is harsh I think. completely understand where you are coming from, getting a constant sick kid is something I do not envy. I also give you a pretty high level of kudos for the no gender thing, that\u2019s savvy.", "So you\u2019re complaining about not being able to pay rent, yet you go out for dinner multiple times?", "it soudns like you're doing everything right. just keep doing that, and keep records of everything. yes, it sucks now, but will get better. having a long stretch of time with you having proof that you're the one that established responsible parenting behavior will go further with the courts than anything else.\n\nit also sounds like she just wants a kid when it's convenient for her and doesn't get in the way of her social life. if your boy is sick then don't leave him there to be passively ignored or neglected, even if it's her time by the court agreement. don't make a scene about it and be a good dad, and just keep documenting to better pad your case.\n\nonce you have full custody the terrain shifts and then you'll have a lot more say in your ex's visitation and you can still let him see his grandparents on her side whenever you and him are up for it.", "Says the person not taking their kid during what you and your ex agreed to being your time per your own custody agreement.", "Hmm, I am not so sure... the amazing parents that I know that have to share custody take every single chance that they can get to spend with their children since they are already spending a lot of time not parenting..", "Amazing parents are more than happy to take care of their sick child.", "Dude, you're as much as a bad parent as your ex. You're just to clueless to realize it.", "1. They live for free with their parents. They don't pay bills. So, they cannot lose electricity or heat for missing work - they often skip work to just go out.   \n\n2. My kid spends at least 3 times as much time with my ex's parents than the do with my ex.  \n\n3. I already offered to pay for a sitter, a hotel, whatever they needed, and offered to take extra time when possible. I am not refusing to see my kid - I am refusing to take my sick child for the seventh or eighth time this year (multiple were THEIR time, mind you) because last month it nearly cost me my apartment.", "No. As I've stated MANY times, I take the kid even during their time when the kid is sick.", "Good for you? My ex listened to them and agreed to keep the kid. So...  \n\n\nWhat you think and what reality is are 2 different things. I didn't ask for anyone's opinion on what a doctor would say, I already have that info. Thanks.", "According to our verbal agreement, it would be.  \n\n\nAccording to court documents, it is not.", "That would be me!! \n\nNo matter what the situation, no matter if I have plans, meetings, even hospital appointments I ALWAYS say yes to having them any chance I can get. I hate them not being with me and the thought of them knowing I wouldn't want them is so horrendously heartbreaking. I have them every single time they're ill. Chicken pox, flu, stomach bugs, colds. Give me vomit and diarrhoea all day long if I get my kids more.\n\nEdit: not saying I'm an amazing parent, I meant that I want them/have them every single chance I can get.", "And I always do. This is literally the first time I have done so.  \n\n\nMy ex almost never has my kid, their parents do.", "I'm really confused because in another comment you said you paid their electricity bill multiple times, now you are saying they don't have bills. Which is it? Also YTA, when my little man is sick, I want to look after him. If I was in your situation, I'd want him more, if you think your ex will go partying rather than taking care of him. You chose to have a child with someone who is a shitty parent, that means you do more not less. Not decide to wait til they are in middle school to be a full time parent. This is definitely about screwing your ex on their birthday plans cause you are pissed off.", "I get how that can be frustrating, my ex husband lived with his mom, sister and now wife and I really resented that when it was time for visitation (he lives 1800km away) he didn\u2019t have to do anything as they dote on him, meanwhile it\u2019s just me here. He\u2019s never taken a sick day to take care of the kids, or worried that utilities would get cut off.  My daughter\u2019s father wasn\u2019t good for much and has passed away (heck sometimes I resent how easy he had it being a deadbeat). We have to take parenting classes here with divorce or family court hearings, something they drilled into me is that you have to really work to get these kind of comparisons out of your head as they will eat you alive. It\u2019s just not ever going to be fair, and there isn\u2019t much to be done about it, coparenting is rough! \n\nMaybe get masks and try to keep them to one room as much as possible? Or also you could try asking their parents directly to keep them for the weekend. If you approach it less like it\u2019s not fair and your ex isn\u2019t pulling their weight and more as it\u2019s holiday season and you just can\u2019t afford to take any more risks at work maybe they will want to help out", "Honestly, the people above don't seem to understand your situation.\nIf you loose your job, then your housing - what good is that for the kid?\nFuck, you'd probably end up with less custody of they took it to court.\n\nNTA", "Congrats on being a shit parent I guess \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. It doesn\u2019t help your case to lie on here but keep at it slugger.", "Whoever is on the signed court order from the judge for the time in question is responsible for taking care of the kid. Birthday or not. Sickness or not.", "So all the sudden you want to go by what your dr supposedly said to do, to screw your ex over on their bday. \n\nMakes sense.", "I said they DON'T PAY BILLS. Not that they don't have them.\n\nKnow why? Because everyone else pays them.", "I am not lying - I have no reason to.", "That is why I keep stating - even though my ex SHOULD be LEGALLY obliged to do so, we don't care about the court document. We have literally NEVER followed it.  \n\n\nWhat I care about is my kid being safe, healthy, and taken care of. And according to my child's doctor, they should not be passing germs around. They need to stay home from school, not be traveling around for plans, and not changing hands of parents. So, that is what I am sticking with.", "I only now asked the doctor because it has been a talking point for months now.  \n\n\nHas nothing to do with \"screwing over my ex\". I helped my ex through the worst parts of their life, and still offer to pay for all my kid's needs AND THEIRS. I covered their electric bill multiple times. We go out on double dates and all that.  \n\n\nThis illness thing is the biggest point of contention with us, and last month I lost 7 days of work due to it. So yes, I asked the doc for an answer, and then gave that info to my ex."]}
