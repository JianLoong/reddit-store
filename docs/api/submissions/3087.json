I have no sick days left, and last time I got something my kid had I lost 7 days of work while my current partner lost 4 - we even had to borrow money to pay our rent...  \n\n\nMy child is 8 years old, and gets sick about average for a kid that age. My ex always seems to want to pass the kiddo off to us whenever they are sick, even when I called their doctor and got advice from several nurses there all saying the same thing - if kid is sick, they should stay put.  \n\n\nThis week/weekend is also my ex's birthday, and I know they have plans for the holiday and their birthday that they will need to cancel.   \n\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my ex I will not take our kid until they are flu free?\n\nEDIT: To clarify a few things, since there has been a lot of assumptions I'm adding more info below.\n\n1. I'm the mother, not the dad. I purposefully left gender out of the post to keep it unbiased, but it seems most people just assume I'm a man for whatever reason and then provide sexist \"deadbeat dad\" replies.\n\n2. I constantly see my child during \"my ex's time\" because they refuse to take care of our child when sick. This isn't me shirking responsibility - I constantly cover for them, to the point that I lose significant amount of time at work.\n\n3. We have a custody agreement. We don't follow it because it literally makes no sense. It's something like Tuesday to Friday alternating - my kid has school, it literally is impossible to make that work. The ONLY reason we have court papers is because one of our parents is insane and decided to take me and my ex to court over visitation rights when we both refused to let our kid around them. We both have a verbal agreement that is adjusted as needed, and has worked for us so far... Outside of how I am the only one handling the kid when sick.\n\n4. My ex only has more time with my kid because of the school situation. We lived in their district when our kid was enrolled, and I didn't want to just force my child to change schools upon our breakup. Two adults didn't work out romantically, it's effecting them more than it should already, moving schools and possibly losing friends along the way was not something we wanted to include.\n\n5. Me and my ex are mostly amicable. I hate how they parent, but we stayed friends after the breakup. That friendship is slowly dissolving over time due to how poorly I see my child is being treated...\n\n6. \"Why don't you get custody then?\" If it were that simple, it would already have been done. It isn't that simple.

So if you're  ex is due to take the kid back on a Thursday ,  and the kid has a cold he still takes  the kid back, unless the doctor says otherwise, that way there will be no dumping at inconvenient times.

They say it\u2019s better for them to stay put so that\u2019s the decision. If the dad doesn\u2019t agree, it\u2019ll have to be taken back to custody court and you will most likely have to rework your custody agreement to fit what you currently do, but it\u2019s not too hard if you guys agree for the most part. \nI know it\u2019s not easy going to court for all of these issues. My bfs mom has four kids she\u2019s had to have custody agreements and battles for. That being said, please consider looking into getting primary custody of the child if you have the ability to handle that.

From your post I suspect not.  Those are both valid reasons to not change plans.  Also, you don\u2019t need to take care of your ex anymore.

Just wear a mask and wash your hands like they do.", "YTA.  Nit because you want to be cautious & are concerned about getting sick.  It's because you have a child who you state is mistreated by the dad who has primary.  You are making this about you instead of kid.  Your reasons for not wanting primary are short sighted.  If a child is treated unwell but stays in the same school district & keeps friends, then the child is still a child why just yearns for peace and kindness.  That is the true goal.  You are kid's mom.  THE person who is supposed to look out for the child's wellbeing.  Having a contentious ex makes it so much harder too.  But, think about your child not just today, but 5, 10 years from now.  How they develop because of their environment.  Do they learn that their best bet when things are bad are to talk to mom or figure it out with friends.  Trust me, you want it to be you.  Please rethink the whole custody thing.  A move to a loving home may be hard, but growing up neglected, feeling less than is worse.\nAlso, it doesn't matter why dad doesn't want kid.  All that matters to your kid is that when chips are down & dad, as usual, tries to dump kid off, mom always makes kid feel wanted.  Dad is wrong.  Kid is sick.
