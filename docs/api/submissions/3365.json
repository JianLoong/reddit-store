You can break down tasks like washing into separate pieces like load, hang, fold, and put away. Same for cooking if you do planning, shopping, cooking, and dishes separately.

Have the discussion and compromise. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve divided up the chores make a plan to revisit the division regularly because things change. \n\nWhen it comes to chores a fair/non-asshole balance really depends on the opinions of the folks living together.

Not.**\n\nAs a person who does my own wash and hangs it, it's a lot less labor and time to load the machine and set it on.  Your GF is rightfully upset about the task of taking the heavy load out of the machine and the time it takes it to hang to dry.\n\nYou can offer to take it out when you get home from work and the two of you do it together, or you can offer to be the one who folds it and puts it away after she hangs it.", "Yta", "Do you not have a dryer? It takes just as much energy to put things in a dryer as it does a washer. NTA, it's not like it needs done everyday and her clothes are in there too.", "Well I feel NTA. Cos it can\u2019t all wait till your home. However maybe a simple solution to this is you both start washing stuff separately for a while, sure it\u2019ll be a pain in the ass but then neither can complain about having to do more", "a slight ESH\n\nYou're not an AH for starting the laundry - but it's more of the attitude: \"**it doesn't take much to hang it out on her day off when she's home.**\" This is very dismissive of her time and perhaps THAT is the reason she's so pissed off.  Have you been dealing with other household chores this way ie 'YOU have more time off YOU can easily clean the toilet/vacuum/dust/shop/make meals because I am working 9-5!\"  If you are skating by doing the minimum of loading a washing machine & taking out the trash perhaps unloading the washer might be the final straw.\n\nIf this was just something you did without discussing it with her; that too could feel dismissive - like you're leaving work for the maid to finish up.  \n\nYes it's good your putting the cloths in and starting the wash but that is the least time consuming part of laundry.  \n\nINFO: is the wash inside your apartment or is it in a common area? If it's in your home you don't need to be dressed in any particular way you don't have to put on shoes, you just dump everything in all at once,  add detergent, hit a button and go.  The follow up means she needs to be dressed for going outdoors, and it takes 2x as long to to hang every single piece of clothing. She's a slight AH because - while it is the more time & labor intensive part of the job at least the cloths are clean more often during the week meaning LESS laundry to hang, more clothing options during the week, and there will more free time when your both off to enjoy the day vs making it about laundry.  \n\nPersonally my husband and I do what you do all the time, one or the other will start a load and if we have to leave the other will do part 2.  Also when he was out of town I'd often start a load, go to work, and then when I got home put it into the dryer&hang.  Yes it's been sitting in the washing machine all day but no harm comes to it.  This will only work if you have your own washer vs an apartment complex shared machine.  THAT might be something to suggest too - if she's got to much on her plate that day just let it sit and the two of you can hang it up when you get home.  \n\nTake some time out, sit down together and as calmly as possible make a chore list and divide things up reasonably.  Talk it out and stop assuming.  It takes a while for people who just started living together to work things out.", "NTA, but y'all need to sot down and talk, find out her reasoning behind wanting to spend a good majority of y'alls days off doing chores all at once instead of slowing doing them during the work week. Also, there might be something else going on that y'all need to work through.", "Don't you have a dryer?", "NTA, just do your own laundry and it saves a lot of arguments later on in life. Just put your laundry in and tell her not to bother hanging it out and if you put it on the timer, you can get it to be done by the time you get home. Hang your own laundry and she can do the same.", "NTA probably, this just sounds like a communication problem \n\nI'd ask her why she feels that it is unacceptable. She may very well have a reason for feeling that way. Disagreeing about chores is normal, communication is really the only way to straighten it out that I know of.
