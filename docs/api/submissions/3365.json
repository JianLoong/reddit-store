You can break down tasks like washing into separate pieces like load, hang, fold, and put away. Same for cooking if you do planning, shopping, cooking, and dishes separately.

Not.**\n\nAs a person who does my own wash and hangs it, it's a lot less labor and time to load the machine and set it on.

Cos it can\u2019t all wait till your home. However maybe a simple solution to this is you both start washing stuff separately for a while, sure it\u2019ll be a pain in the ass but then neither can complain about having to do more", "a slight ESH\n\nYou're not an AH for starting the laundry - but it's more of the attitude: \"**it doesn't take much to hang it out on her day off when she's home.**\" This is very dismissive of her time and perhaps THAT is the reason she's so pissed off.  Have you been dealing with other household chores this way ie 'YOU have more time off YOU can easily clean the toilet/vacuum/dust/shop/make meals because I am working 9-5!\"  If you are skating by doing the minimum of loading a washing machine & taking out the trash perhaps unloading the washer might be the final straw.\n\nIf this was just something you did without discussing it with her; that too could feel dismissive - like you're leaving work for the maid to finish up.  \n\nYes it's good your putting the cloths in and starting the wash but that is the least time consuming part of laundry.  \n\nINFO: is the wash inside your apartment or is it in a common area? If it's in your home you don't need to be dressed in any particular way you don't have to put on shoes, you just dump everything in all at once,  add detergent, hit a button and go.  The follow up means she needs to be dressed for going outdoors, and it takes 2x as long to to hang every single piece of clothing. She's a slight AH because - while it is the more time & labor intensive part of the job at least the cloths are clean more often during the week meaning LESS laundry to hang, more clothing options during the week, and there will more free time when your both off to enjoy the day vs making it about laundry.  \n\nPersonally my husband and I do what you do all the time, one or the other will start a load and if we have to leave the other will do part 2.  Also when he was out of town I'd often start a load, go to work, and then when I got home put it into the dryer&hang.  Yes it's been sitting in the washing machine all day but no harm comes to it.  This will only work if you have your own washer vs an apartment complex shared machine.  THAT might be something to suggest too - if she's got to much on her plate that day just let it sit and the two of you can hang it up when you get home.  \n\nTake some time out, sit down together and as calmly as possible make a chore list and divide things up reasonably.  Talk it out and stop assuming.  It takes a while for people who just started living together to work things out.", "NTA, but y'all need to sot down and talk, find out her reasoning behind wanting to spend a good majority of y'alls days off doing chores all at once instead of slowing doing them during the work week. Also, there might be something else going on that y'all need to work through.", "Don't you have a dryer?", "NTA, just do your own laundry and it saves a lot of arguments later on in life. Just put your laundry in and tell her not to bother hanging it out and if you put it on the timer, you can get it to be done by the time you get home. Hang your own laundry and she can do the same.", "NTA probably, this just sounds like a communication problem \n\nI'd ask her why she feels that it is unacceptable. She may very well have a reason for feeling that way. Disagreeing about chores is normal, communication is really the only way to straighten it out that I know of.

If that shit ain't hung up with in an hour- hour & a half TOPS, you can rest assured you'll be rewashing due to sour smells.\nTropics take no time at all to sour an entire load of laundry.", "6-7 hours will ABSOLUTELY make the clothes at least stink like hell and get wrinkly. I personally would never hang clothes that's been sitting in the washing machine for longer than an hour. But that's not excuse, the clothes can be washed after work, the gf can put it in an hour or so before the op comes home, there is the start delay option and so on.", "He could put the load of washing on at night and hang it in the morning. As he said it doesn\u2019t take very long to hang so he has the time.", "It depends where you live. Mine would definitely start to smell and need to be re-washed.", "Now I know why all my California glass fusing friends have their kilns on in the early hours of the morning", "Interesting! What parts of the world do this? Also what do you do about lights from sundown to 10 PM?\n\nEdit: Also lights during the day for rooms with no windows ?", ">Usually leaving clothes in that long makes them wrinkly.\n\nMost machines have a delay start-option that he could use.", "Hate to tell you, but I've got 3 teens that all wash their own laundry, and it's frequently left in the washer for 12+ hours, and dried without any dryer sheets and we don't have any issues with the clothes smelling.", "You can use electricity during those times, and lights don\u2019t tend to draw that much power.", "I think it\u2019s a discussion to be had if he works full time and she part - but he mentioned shifts, which makes me think she works full time but not at the same times.  And that would mean he gets his share of time off that she has to work.  My sister works overnights in and ER and runs into that attitude - people want to act like she must have so much extra time \u201conly\u201d working 3-4 days a week and having \u201call day\u201d home, without ever considering she is at work 12.5 hours each night she works then has to make up sleep during the day.  Shift work is not a piece of cake, even when it suits your personality!", "Maybe he wants her to make him breakfast too, since she's already making it for herself. (Sorry, that post killed me).", "I did this very early on in my relationship with my now husband because he's a messy person and when we did our laundry together and he took them to put away some item of mine would inevitably disappear into his pile of clothes. \n\nNow I haven't lost so much as a sock in over a decade. Highly recommend.", "When she works weekends, and he is off, she should start a load for him to hang up, since ya know, he's off with nothing better to do.\nEdit: because i can't type", "They hang dry. The wrinkles from the machine will absolutely stay.", "No, that's the washer lol. Semi wet clothes sitting in a crumpled ball for 7 hours are going to get wrinkles.", "Eh, results are highly dependent on the machine and the climate. Point is, everyone's needs will vary.", "Hate to tell you but probs you all have degraded smell from all that mold. 12+ hrs is a guaranteed moldy clothes, the spores start to grow after between 8 and 12h. And the clothes already start to smell not too nice after one hour. I know that very well because I've been raised in a very clean household and then went through a boyfriend who would leave the clothes in the washing machine for hours. And then I went through a roommate who would put clothes to washing and then leave for the weekend. The smell was terrifying but he couldn't smell it either. And then the washing machine and the bathroom started to smell too and started to get on my clothes.", "I agree that it's because she does shift work while he does a 9-5. And as you say if she did have more free time compared to him then it could be a discussion BUT unless he's paying her way or something she doesn't really owe him more than a fair division of labor at home. \n\nThe thing is... He's having no discussion he's just starting a big job and leaving her to finish it. I have to wonder how he would react if on his weekend she did the same to him?", "Haha... Holy crap, you're right! I read that one too. Apparently it's the day for clueless dudes to post their grievances against their partners who don't owe them free labor \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly my thought! I think this is Iranian yogurt and the _room-that-must-not-be-named_ territory!", "Too right. If he keeps it up, he'll likely end up doing his own laundry, cooking, cleaning, and shopping because she'll find someone who doesn't make twice the laundry she does and then gets mad that she's not doing it for him.", "Work smarter, not harder \ud83d\ude09", "Exactly.", "This has never ever been a problem for me. All it takes is a vigorous shake/snap of the clothing before I hang it.", ">clueless dudes to post their grievances against their partners who don't owe them free labor\n\nBoy I wish I'd learned this earlier than I did.", "Then he can do his part. How interesting it almost seem to fall in her to do most of the work", "Thanks! \ud83d\ude0a", "This is such a good point! People definitely do this. You\u2019re right that\u2019s it\u2019s not only how many chores but how hard, how long each one takes.", "Weaponized incompetence", "Your dad is funny. Glad you guys have the same kind of humor.", "Yeah, but it\u2019s an electric dryer, not air dry", "My partner works shifts. Sometimes he'll do 5 days in a row of 7.30am- 8/10pm/12am with 2 nights on call which might means he's woken up in the night, back again at 7.30am\n\nIf he needs 2 days off completely after that I think it is very reasonable", "We have it in Ontario, Canada, too.", "That\u2026 seems hard.", "Agree, except I am guessing the expectation is that partner will do it and it gets mentioned if they don't. Just because the person has a day off or works at home(which is not a day off) you don't get to dictate what they do with it - and hanging items out takes 10x longer than putting a load in the machine. YTA OP.", "I'm wondering if he knows she's going to do her own laundry that day so he tosses his in and starts it so she has to remove it anyway to get hers done.", "Thanks. This ladies and gentlemen is the way !", "Most washing machines have a delay function don't they? Just set it to finish right as he gets home", "He makes it sound like this was his habit since before she moved in, so I'm sure he was drying the clothes after work without issue. It seems like his girlfriend is making assumptions and unnecessarily taking it upon herself to hang the wash. NTA Tell her not to worry about the wash, you'll hang it after work.", "I ended up having to tell my now ex that I will do my own laundry. He'd leave it in the washer for a day or two. It'd smell and I'd just have to rewash it anyways. When I do laundry I make sure I have enough time to wash, dry and put away. And yes I would do his laundry. I just requested that he not do mine.", "It depends on how often you clean your machine and how well your clothes are getting cleaned too. \n\nMine used to get the wet dog smell if they sat in the machine too long. Then I started using cloth nappies on my baby and had to look into washing best practices, essentially. Turns out I wasn't cleaning my machine regularly enough, was underdosing washing liquid/powder, and wasn't setting the water level correctly for the amount of clothes (for ideal agitation). \n\nNow my clothes can stay in the washing machine for heaps longer without a problem.", "Except he doesn\u2019t realize there aren\u2019t two halves to laundry. It also has to be put away so she\u2019s actually more than likely doing the longest 2/3 of the laundry.", "Yikes, sounds like it's a good thing they are your ex!", "How about you have an adult, reasonable conversation with your girlfriend about division of housework and responsiblities instead of running to reddit for the opnion of strangers?", "Wtf? People who are voting Y T A and victimising the gf for doing laundry really need to grow up\u2026 so what if she has to hang some laundry? GASP OH NO. SHE HAS TO BE AN ADULT AND HANG LAUNDRY. it takes all but 5 mins. Ffs.", "Oh, come now!  Simple solution is if she doesn\u2019t like hanging the laundry, then she should put the clothes into the wash & he can hang it on his day off, right?  I mean, in OP\u2019s mind, she would be doing 50% of the work & he could do the other 50% that she\u2019s just not that fond of doing for some reason\u2026..", "YTA.  Throwing a pile of clothes into a washer is almost effortless & takes seconds.  Pulling a pile of wet clothes out if the washer & hanging each of them up individually to dry on the line is far from effortless & takes several minutes.  \n\nYou\u2019re doing basically the easiest chore there is while leaving her with one of the hardest.  And you know it.  For both those reasons, YTA.", "\u2026You\u2019ve never properly hung laundry in your life if you think it takes 5 minutes.", "Hanging them takes significantly longer than washing.", "Folding laundry extremely chill chore because you can just do it while you're watching TV. No reason for it to become a point of contention.", "Days\u2026? You mean 1 day. Because it will be daytime literally the next day.", "Lmao at listing \"wiping the counter\" as its own item", "OP\u2019s comment makes it so much worse. Adults don\u2019t have chores.  Has he been asking for an allowance?", "If they're hanging it outside, that's her stuck at home so she can bring it in if it rains", "saaaaame!", "Who said any of OP's laundry is even dry before he returns from work?", "Don't forget how heavy wet laundry is!  \n\nIt's not just more time, but a lot more physical labor. Carrying a lot of wet laundry to the clothes line and repeatedly lifting wet laundry to do all that is an arm workout. \n\nOP also says nothing about who takes the clothes off of the clothesline and folds them. \n\nINFO: Does she have to take down and fold the previous day's laundry before putting up the new load you left her, or do you do that after you get home from work? How much laundry do you do on your days off?", "He also said that the basket of the washing machine was full so he didn\u2019t sort or pre-treat or load. He literally just added soap and hit a button. That\u2019s like 30 seconds of work.", "Plus it means she can't make too many plans for the day while it's out in case it rains and she's probably the one bringing it all in again and folding it.", "And it has to be at a specific time, once the machine is done, or everything wrinkles anyways.", "I'm in the US and have delay start on my washer (and my dishwasher), and we have peak/off peak pricing. I know it varies by state, but check with your electric company. It isn't always made known unless you ask for it specifically.", "Yeah I was going to say, it's hot and humid most of the year where I live, and leaving damp clothes in the machine all day would mean the whole load would permanently stink of mildew.", "On a technological level, this should be possible anywhere you have smart meters.\n\nPower retailers would like people to shift their usage to off-peak times, because:\n\n* it reduces the possibility of blackouts or brownouts from too much demand, which are things that cause their customers (and maybe powerful politicians) to hate them, and\n* it reduces the need for your power company to buy energy on the spot market at very high wholesale rates and then sell it to customers at much lower retail rates that were fixed in advance.\n\nIf you have a smart meter and your power company doesn't have plans like that, just call them and ask about it. If they get enough customer interest, they might introduce one.", "This is the way.", "Never been a problem for me", "Never happened to me and I routinely leave them in the washer overnight.", "Not sure I've ever read room-that-must-not-be-named....
