The day before Xmas eve,  my son was going to have a sleepover at our house with seven of his friends because they all wouldn't see each other for a couple of weeks.\n\nAlex came a few hours early and he and Matt spend a long time on the trampoline. When they came inside, they were both sweaty and stinky. I told them to go shower before their friends came over. My son shrugged and went upstairs to shower. \n\nI looked at Alex and asked if he was waiting for an invite. He said I don't have any clothes. I said you can use your pajamas. Make sure you put deodorant on. You can use Matt's if you don't have any. He stared at me. I said go take a shower. He said no.\n\nI said hell no. You don't say no to me. I'm 10 years older than your dad. I made him take showers and I will make you too. I eventually did. The rest of the night was uneventful. They did their secret santa, pizza, video games, etc.\n\nThe day after Xmas, my brother calls me and asked me what was this thing about making Alex take a shower. I said he came in sweaty and gross and I told him and Matt to go shower before their friends came over. Matt did, no problem. Getting your kid to take a shower was like getting a cat to take one. He accused me of bullying Alex.

Did you just want to argue with strangers on the internet or do you actually want outsider perspective?", "YTA.\n\nYou sound obsessed with \"respect\", which is pretty pathetic.\n\nA kid does not owe you respect just because you're a) older than him, and b) mean. \n\nYou sound threatening, and I wouldn't want kids around you.", "General idea of getting your nephew to shower? You're not the asshole. You wanted him to shower because he smelt bad, that's fine\n\nThe way you approached it makes you the asshole, at least the way you wrote about it makes you the asshole. I mean, he's a fucking 10 year old. Did you even ask him why he didn't want to shower? Did you think to call your brother and ask him if this is a common issue?", "YTA - You were harsh and rude. Id also imagine a 10 year old not wanting to already be in their pajamas when everyone shows up for the sleepover.\n\nAlso what does you being older than his dad matter?", "NTA, but it was kinda shitty for you to make him put on his pajamas if all the rest of the kids were gonna be wearing regular clothes. Didn't he have clothes to wear for the next day? Or could he have borrowed an outfit from your son or could you have just washed his clothes before the other kids got there? But ultimately it's completely reasonable for you to tell a sweaty kid that he needs to shower.", "\u201cI\u2019m older than you so I can force you to shower.\u201d\n\nYTA, but based on your comments to others you already know that and don\u2019t care. Don\u2019t be creepy around your nephew.", "YTA. Not because you wanted him to shower, but for the way you handled it. Respect is earned not blindly given. Just because you are ten years older than your brother means nothing. Toy talked to your nephew and brother in disrespectful ways, but demand respect from them. You are a bully.", "YTA and your attitude is awful", "Isn't forcing a kid who's not yours to shower and not taking his wishes into account treating him like a 4 year old?\n\nYTA based on how you describe your interpersonal interactions, and I feel for your brother.", "YTA. You really wanna take a sand on something so dumb and frivolous?", "YTA. That is not an acceptable way to talk to a child.", "Did you ask him why he didn't want to take a shower?\n\nDid you ask him if he was comfortable wearing his cousin's clothes?\n\nI suggest reading The Explosive Child. \n\nYou will get further with kids using those techniques than you will trying to force kids to do anything. \n\nPlus, by shifting your method, your new behaviors won't damage relationships or make your kids and your nephews afraid of you.\n\n'Cause that's what you're doing now: making little kids afraid of you.", "YTA honestly just for your attitude. did you even ask him why?", "YTA. \n\nThe child, even at 10, has bodily autonomy. It sounds like he didn't want to shower because he was at your house, only had pajamas, and had an adult trying to force him. I am sure there were alternatives like using a washcloth to wash himself up or the like. No need for him to be forced into an uncomfortable position because you said so. You could have also called dad and had dad ask him to take a shower or even bring over a change of clothes.", "He didn't have any clothes. He didn't want to wear pjs that weren't his.

And of course a 10-year old is going to feel a little self-conscious when he's not in his own home...you should have been a little more considerate, like had your son give him some extra clothes so he didn't have to be the only kid at the party in pajamas.  Not all parents would immediately insist on their kids taking a shower after playing on a trampoline.  You made it seem so 'non negotiable'.  Not that big a deal is it? H's 10, not a 17-year old back from the gym.  Kids play all day at school, you tell me you make your son shower every night when he walks in the door?  'Hell no, you don't say no to me?'  ffs...It was a little heavy-handed.", "YTA. Who gives a fuck? Kids are gonna be dirty and smelly.

He's a kid and you have a superiority complex, your kid listened to you because he doesn't want to deal with you", "YTA -\n\nI originally planned on saying you weren't, but I took the time to read your responses as well as the post.\n\nWhy did you bother making it if you're going to be super defensive in the comments and not actually take anything anyone has said on board? You're not here for genuine advice, you're here to be validated and the post isn't going the way you want it, so you're being defensive. \n\nYou're not TA for making him shower, you are TA for the way you handled the situation and from what I can gather not offering for him to borrow normal clothes, not PJs. And TA for making a post clearly searching to be validated, not to actually understand what you did wrong.\n\nEdit: Just to add to this, being 10 years older makes no difference when you don't have the maturity or mental capacity that goes with your age. Do better.", "YTA. You sound like a drill sergeant. This is a remarkably harsh way to talk to a child.", "YTA for your attitude.  \n\n\nYou being 10 years older then his dad has nothing to do with anything.

Your attitude is horrifc.", "YTA\n\nUnderstandable sentiment, particularly as you approach teenage years where they\u2019ll become a BO factory. But this whole respect complex, and arguing with the YTA comments, puts you in TA territory. \n\nWord of advice - get used to pushback. You\u2019ve got a lot more of that coming in the next few years.", "YTA for how you\u2019re responding to these comments bro. And do you even hold an ounce of respect for your brother? Like holy shit the way you talk about them makes me believe you genuinely loathe them.", "Not bullying. If he had continued to refuse to bathe, his dad needed to come pick him up. No sleepover.

Your bro is accepting behavior that will make your nephew an outcast in his current friend group.", "NTA - these people who claim that you aren't entitled to respect from your 10 year old nephew are nuts.  He is a child, and you are the adult in charge of him - and one making a reasonable and normal request.

It sounds like in your house that doesn\u2019t fly and that\u2019s okay. Those are the rules of your house and when he\u2019s visiting he should be expected to follow them. My nieces aren\u2019t allowed to jump on my couch. They\u2019re also not allowed to tell me no (unless it\u2019s like they don\u2019t wanna hug me or something related to *safe* bodily autonomy).

We have the discussion every year and every year he tries again and we have the same talk and he lies and looks at me and then corrects himself because I won\u2019t put up with it. \n\nSo while making the kid put his pjs on kinda sucks, it also sounds like the two cousins are close enough that he could have been able to ask his cousin for a change of clothes. \n\nAnd 10 year olds can definitely stink, they don\u2019t even have to be boys.", "Idiot", "Kids can purposely be assholes", "He absolutely bullied his son and I'm sure he bullied his dad too. Good for the son, his dad's probably taught him to stand up to bullies after being forced to live with one. The dad I'm sure knew exactly what went down cause he lived it.", "Its fine - tbh it provided some much needed context", "Refusing to shower when you stink is acting like a 4-year-old.\n\nInsisting a kid does shower when he doesn't want to is treating him like a 4-year-old.\n\nOP stance holds up.", "Well, at least in the latter instance you know he\u2019s trying to keep clean. Better than having a biohazard in your house.", "10yo kids say far worse", "[deleted]", "I've had a couple and been around a lot, and I just don't see them giving a shit about whether a kid takes a shower after they get dirty playing outside.  Kids are all different though. \n\nSeriously though this isn't about showering, it's about a butthurt dad who can't take it when his rules aren't followed and thinks he needs to teach his nephew some discipline. I'll take the guy's brother's word for it that the lesson was not appreciated.", "That story about your cousin sounds like it isn't about kids learning respect, it's about grownups needing to control their tempers around kids and keeping their fragile egos in check.", "Nope I don't want anyone else teaching my kids discipline, that's messed up.  OP's brother clearly agrees.", "Thats what I was thinking.", "I never said anybody was a brat. \n\nAnd my father is a wonderful person and he was a great father growing up. \n\nKeep on projecting there, bud. I hope things improve for you.", "If a kid saying they don\u2019t want to shower at your house is testing boundaries, maybe you should check your boundaries.", "The guy sounds authoritarian. Which may as well be crazy, because it's sitting yourself in the foot as far as parenting goes.\n\nAnd if you're wondering my motivation for my comment, it's because I raised 3 kids and they're *exceptional* and successful and I was never the \"my way or the highway\" type", "Demanding respect from someone you don't respect, who's dad you don't respect, is crazy. Respect is a two way street. If my brother said something so disrespectful, spewing that \"birth order makes me more important than you\" bs then I hope my kid talks back to him, cause I teach my kids to stand up to bullies. That's all OP is, a bully. A scared, self conscious, powerless bully who strong arms who he can to try and feel better about himself. It has nothing to do with deciding sides ahead of time. It's knowing anyone who thinks you can \"demand\" respect instead of earn it is completely unhinged.", "Yeah, he sounds like a drill sergeant. \"Hell no. You don't say no to me. I'm 10 years older than your dad. I made him take showers and I will make you too.\" Like wow, swearing, saying he can't say no, implying he has authority over another full grown man just because he's the older brother, which, ***NO***. There's a lot of intimidation used here.", "That's why we discipline", "apparently so can you", "Okay, yes, sure - but you just assumed he was being an asshole, rather than ***asking him why***", "And so can you - to a child no less! YTA for comments like this alone.", "And so can you, obviously. YTA", "I'm guessing OP didn't actually see if he was stinky, it was just \"play outside, go shower\". He's clearly a rules-is-rules guy.", "There's no issue in wanting a stinky kid to shower if they're staying in your home. The way he handled it is the issue. Demanding respect while also being extremely disrespectful to his brother aka the kids dad....directly to the kid. If I had a kid sleeping over who needed a shower and they didn't want to I'd do the sane thing, call the kids parent, explain the situation, and have the parent handle it. I wouldn't go around yelling and beating my chest like an overgrown monkey demanding everyone has to listen to him cause he's a big boy now.", "Both are biohazards", "That doesn't matter. You're the adult. **Act like it.** Instead of using swearing and intimidation to make him do things.", "Your kid no doubt", "\"I didn't swear\" -OP\n\n- *hell is a low level swear word*...\n\n\"10yo is kids say far worse\" -OP playing both sides of the field and being a goal moving hypocrite\n\nYTA for being a bully online and IRL, takes a lot more maturity than that to be an adult and if you expect a child to act their age you should be to", "Apparently saying not to have your first response be a rant that was clearly meant to intimidate a child instead of starting off with a countdown or something is, \"pearl clutching.\"", "My kids hear worse than \"hell\" pretty often but it is indeed a swear word, and you're indeed being a prick.", "Well as per the expression you clutch your own pearls, not someone else\u2019s.", "Yeah you\u2019ve been around a lucky few it\u2019s rough over here\ud83d\ude13 the kids are literally demons where I\u2019m at. But yeah I get your point the dad did have a shitty attitude he could\u2019ve handled it better.", "No, you are not entitled to respect from anyone. People like you are the reason why my parents taught me as a child to humble egotistical assholes like you.", "No it's not.\n\nYour kids will be failures and it will be squarely on your head.\n\nI know, I raised 3 kids. Your way never turns out good.", "Yeah, maybe the kid was uncomfortable getting naked at someone else\u2019s house?\n\nI was always uncomfortable showering when I wasn\u2019t home as a kid.\n\nMaybe he didn\u2019t know where the soap, towels were, or how to turn on the shower\u2026.\n\nOp YTA. Who takes a child\u2019s discomfort as \u201cdisrespect\u201d? Only someone uncomfortable in their masculinity\u2026", "And to be fair, right around when my kid turned 12 he started to stink whenever it was hot at school, and we had to have talks about showering regularly and using deodorant, precisely to avoid that kind of inevitable teasing.  I had to be really insistent, but it became routine pretty quickly.", "Sadly I don\u2019t think his definition of good is the same as yours."]}
