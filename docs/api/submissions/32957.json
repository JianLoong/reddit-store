The absolute nerve to call you names!!!!  They absolutely are not honoring the fact that your grandmother owned this land legally but they believe a guilt trip can get them free property.  They seem to be the AH here, not you.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou had no part in any of those agreements.  Legally it is yours.

Your grandmother only agreed to ASK your mother to give them the property. What would grandmother have said if her daughter informed her that she really wanted to give the property to you and that you wanted it? The reason they want it is because they say your mother wasn't going to do anything with the property well it sounds like your mother wanted you to have it so she was doing something with the property. Grandmothers word was only to ask your mother....not give them the property.", "NTA. \n\nDid I get it right that your grandmother had already given the land to your mother, when her siblings asked for it? \n\nIf it is like that... there is no reason for you to give them the land. As your grandmother only promised to \"ask her daughter\" (choice of words).", "NTA\n\nYou've received a gift that is yours to keep, despite harassment from others in the family. You were right to show them the way out, so to speak.

It's your land and your decision on what you do with it.", "NTA. Not in writing not theirs.", "So the hounded an old lady for a period of time, and finally coerced her to consider it. Damn they\u2019re ruthless", "NTA.  It is your property.  You do not owe these distant entitled relatives anything.  They only want something for nothing.  You are free to keep, use, or sell the land as you wish.", "NTA. They were demanding", "NTA. She only agreed (and not in time to change her will or even note it down somewhere) under duress and pressure from them.  If you don't want it you could offer to sell it to them at market price.

She gave it to your mother. They are greedy and begged her to go back on her word to your mother. They have no honor or respect for what your Grandmother wanted.  They waited until she was sick and tried to force her to steal the land back from your mother. NTA but stop talking to them.", "Let me get this straight. The land already belonged to your mother. Your grandmother was going to \"ASK\" your mother to give it to her relatives. She died before she could \"ASK\" your mother. Is that correct? Whether she got to ask her or not, the fact remains that the land already belonged to your mother, and she was under no obligation to give in to this request. Your \"grandmother's word\" was just to make a request. She had no control over what your mother's answer would be, and therefore no power to make any sort of promise to do anything more than make a request. NTA.", "Also, who told you she said this? The siblings. Because you said in your explanation that grandma didn\u2019t have time to speak with your mom before she passed. Sounds love your aunts/uncles and cousins are a little conniving and sneaky.", "My grandmother never communicated that to my mother or me. The last \u201cword\u201d we got from her was that mom was inheriting the land.

They did offer to buy it later, but I refused that as well.", ">Did they offer anything in exchange? \n\nThey were demanding it for free earlier, but they offered money later, and I refused that too.\n\nAnd yeah, it was family land.", "Well, I knew my grandmother's sisters (and their grandsons) when I was a child & they used to give me stuff when I visited them, but I don't really want them in my life. I am not sure what you meant by financial situation, but I don't have any problems if that's what you meant.", "Yeah, it was given to my mother's already, and they asked her for it after that.", "I wouldn't sell to them either. They don't deserve it.", "Well it still is family land... that belongs to you.  You do as you see fit.  Anyone that makes nagging demands for something for free and then begrudgingly offers money gives them no right to say anything about you.  It's your right to do with it as you please.", "Do they have big financial problems?", "No, they don't.", "Then keep it if you dont care about probably burning those bridges"]}
