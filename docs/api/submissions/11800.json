It was only when my mother\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s health began to get terminal did they show up again.\n\nThis is where my dilemma begins. a month ago, my grandmother passed away, (My grandfather passed away while I was in middle school and my mother passed away last year) and left me everything. This included her 2 cars, the remainder of her 401K, her life insurance, and most importantly her house. In her will she specifically left Aunt Karen, Cousin Keith, and Cousin Sarah small mementos just to have them mentioned in the will for legal reasons. I currently have no idea what I am going to do with the house. I cannot live in it as it is too small for my growing family.\n\nA week after the funeral Aunt Karen called me. At first the conversation was just idle chit chat and catching up on family. Then she started talking about my cousin Keith. Karen told me all about how he had joined the Marines shortly after I graduated and a year later was dishonorable discharged for drug abuse and how his first wife had left him due to his drug addiction. He had no visitation and was really depressed. She went on to say that he has since got clean, remarried, and has 4 kids with his new wife.\n\nKaren then bluntly asked if Keith and his family could move into my grandmother's house. I was shocked at house easily she was able to make this request. Karen then said he could even pay rent as both Keith and his wife work and make decent money. Karen then went on a long spell about how it would be good for reuniting the family and a bunch of other things that I didn't really hear because I was still in shock. Once I finally snapped out of the daze I was filled with a large amount of rage and began telling her off. I said that I couldn't believe that she could go over 10 years without seeking to me and then have the audacity to play the family card and how this should have been something me and Keith discussed but now I'd rather sell the place long before I let him live in it.\n\nI hung up before she could respond. Since then, I have been getting daily messages from Karen, Keith, and Sarah trying to convince me to talk to them and how they are sorry that they haven't been in touch more often. I don't want to speak to any of them, but my wife believes I should calm down and at least speak to Keith about the situation first and see how I feel about him.\n\nI am starting to feel like a jerk for not even giving them the chance to talk, especially since I still don't have any plans for the house.

I will say this though. You as well could have picked up the phone and extended the olive branch. You have to ask yourself if you want a relationship with these people with no strings attached or to just pass on and not look back if they want the strings. \n\nAlso doing business with family rarely works out because once money & family are together problems arise like them being late on rent because you're family and you'll understand.

They have had how much time to get in touch and only do once they need something? Absolutely not. I\u2019d sell it or rent to a friend or something before them.", "NTA\n\nBetter rent that house or at least get a security cameras and alarms. Also, send your aunt and cousin very official and unambiguous e-mail or message with a clear refusal.", "No Way! This is will end up as that old AITA chestnut,  \u201cI\u2019ve let my relatives live in my house, they are destroying my property and they won\u2019t pay rent,\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t do it. Block them from your phone and find some nice renters with a good rental history to live in your house. \n\nNTA", "NTA overall, but it was wrong to get mad and hang up on your Aunt. You might owe a quick and dirty apology for that. I would just tell her the house is not available at this time, you dont know when it will be, and if you decide to rent it out you will have her let Keith and Family know to apply and you will give them a fair shot. Repeat this as many times as you need too. Write it out and keep it by the phone to help you remember it. And then dont call her back. If Keith reacts in any way badly, you will know you have dodged a big bullet. Good luck and sincere condolonces on your loss.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your grandmother and your mother, the last year must have been really tough for you. It\u2019s wrong and unfair that your extended family is trying to take advantage of you.", "There is nothing worse than a favor. The only thing worse than a favor, is a favor involving money. NTA\n\nSell them the house if you must, but don\u2019t rent it to them.", "NTA.\n\nThe house is yours to do with as you wish.", "Thank you.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I want a relationship with them because of the drama my aunt talked about. I don't want to be involved. The reason I don't consider selling it to them is, based on things not mentioned in the post, I don't think they are currently capable of procuring a loan.", "This. It doesn't seem like they want to live in that house for sentimental reasons, given that they were estranged and essentially left out of the will, so presumably they only want to live there because they think they can pressure you into a below-market rent. Especially since the aunt is already framing it as they could \"even\" pay rent. Don't do it.", "THIS.  The phone works both ways, but if you chose not to have a relationship with them, then that's all they need to know.  That includes a financial relationship or a landlord/tenant relationship. \n\nAnd if they are \"making good money\" they should be able to rent anywhere.  It doesn't have to be granny's house.", "They could rent from anyone. They want to rent from you so they can not pay you and play the family card over and over again because if it works the first time that's the message you're sending. NTA."]}
