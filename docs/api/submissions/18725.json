She said she knew it wasn\u2019t a relationship, but couldn\u2019t understand why he reacted the way he did.Cut to a week later, she comes skipping into the house declaring her and the boy were now in a relationship. Apparently, he\u2019d reacted that way because he had feelings for her and was worried they weren\u2019t reciprocated and so he didn\u2019t want to \u201csend the wrong message\u201d and after apologising, asked my daughter to be his girlfriend.

I got cheated on twice during my teen years, so I know what your daughter will go through when she inevitably discovers the truth for herself, and trust me, she'll be fine with your support.\n\nThe only time parents should get involved in their child's relationship is if physical abuse is happening, or if there is extreme emotional abuse to the point of the child feeling suicidal or something similar.", "Simple honesty, in all my experience of raising teenage girls, has rarely ever gone down well.
