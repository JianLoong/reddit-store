Lots of people have that name. Unless someone explicitly tells you the child is named after you, why would you assume they are?\n\nThat's a very self-absorbed way to view the world. Her response was a bit cutting, but perfectly valid given your bizarre behaviour.", "YTA, I guess. I mean... you grew apart over decades. She's right. You're *not* important enough to be the person she named her baby after. It's not rude, it's the truth. It's weird that you presumed. You probably should have left it as an awkward joke.", "Oof. YTA", "YTA. If you\u2019d grown apart, it\u2019s pretty unlikely the baby would be named after you and saying what you said to her is insulting to her because it makes it sound like she\u2019s still not over the friendship ending. It also makes you seem self centered.", "YTA.\n\u201cI felt as if she were naming her child after me and we didn\u2019t feel close enough for that\u201d yet you thought it was rude when she finally had to put you in your place with \u201cyou\u2019re not important enough.\u201d It\u2019s the same thing!

The main character in everyone\u2019s story!", "YTA....you've also got the biggest case of Main Character Syndrome that I've seen in a while.  You are not the only one in the world with that name. You are not the only one in your circle with that name. Your friend doesn't care that much about you to name her child after you. She told you that. She said what she said because you wouldn't let it go. Get over yourself.", "Yta . Get over yourself", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to jokingly reference how you and the baby go by the same name (since you don\u2019t have the same name, since the shared name is her nickname), but you seem to really believe that it\u2019s odd someone you know would happen to give their child a nickname that is also your, common enough, name. It\u2019s not that odd, there are only so many names.", "YTA, big time. All the way down to your self obsessed overpriced shoes.\n\nThe sun does not rise when you get up in the morning.", "YTA she told you the baby wasn\u2019t named after you, and you doubled down.

If OP was named Rivera-Noodlesby and the friend\u2019s baby popped up with that name, you could probably assume it was inspired by OP. But MIA?? I can count three Mia babies off the top of my head that I know of. Mia is popular. And the kid is Amelia, anyway? Also, let\u2019s pretend the friend did name her baby after OP.
