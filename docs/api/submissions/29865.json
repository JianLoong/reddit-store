You need to grow up", "OP upset because she thought baby was named after her. OP more upset when finding out baby was not in fact named after her. Lmao. OP sounds insufferable .", "Here\u2019s the thing: I have a super rare name for where I live. I\u2019ve only met two others with my name in my entire life. I still wouldn\u2019t think someone named their kid after me if they used my name.\n\nLike maybe Elon Musk\u2019s kid could think that since I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another one in this universe named the same as him, but even then, get over it", "Exactly! She's tge weird one, not Melinda lol", "Yeah but before it was her doing the insulting, now she's being insulted so it's not nice", "right! \n\nMy real name is not common in the US (there were less than 150 of us the year I was born and there were less than 420 in 2022 to put it in perspective). It's a Greek name and the only people I have ever met with my name have literally been named  because their parents met me and thought my name was pretty. \n\nA girl I went to high school with (we were not friends, just acquaintances) named her daughter my name.  I didn't question it at all. I just assumed she thought the name was pretty (or maybe she actually knew somebody with the name, or she went to Greece and heard of it, or a million other things).  I didn't think she was weird or that the baby was named specifically after me. It was just a brief thing I noticed on social media one day and was like oh cool... and went about my day. \n\nOP is an egotistical weirdo and an asshole.", "OP says that the other woman is odd and obsessive, which is hilarious since the only one that comes across as odd and obsessive is OP. \n\nPlus the name Amelia/Mia is super common. I go to the park everyday and every other little girl is named Mia.", "This one is super funny to me, I had a best friend throughout childhood, we were more like sisters, her mother and mine were best friends, we were only a few months apart all of it, we were friends like that until well into highschool and we just grew apart. I still love her and she loves me but we aren't the same people anymore.\n\nShe recently had a daughter and she named her a short version of my name, it was a nickname my Dad always calls me. I have joked to myself, and only myself, that the baby was named after me but I was literally joking (yes I talk to myself) but i didn't think it was weird at all, it's a beautiful name and I love that I know someone with that as their actual name.", "YTA \n\nyou seem like you might have narcissistic traits. i say that because you think things *have* to be about you, you get upset when you\u2019re told you\u2019re not important enough to be named after, and you feel as though people have to ask you to name their child a similar name as you (when your name is one of the most common english names at the moment). it\u2019s not about you, has never been about you, and you should get some therapy my dude.\n\nedit: ayo i didn\u2019t realize this posted as a reply to a comment my bad \ud83d\ude2d", "She didn\u2019t even name it Mia \ud83d\ude2d that\u2019s the craziest part.", "There's having narcissistic traits and there's being a narcissist. People with narcissistic traits sometimes think narcissistic things, narcissists say them.", "She's always been like weirdly obsessed with me. Now that I think about it everyone is weirdly obsessed with me. Why does everyone think I'm so amazing and want to copy me? Everyone else is so weird.", "Even her first comment wouldn\u2019t have been THAT out of line if she had just played it off as 100% a haha we have the same name joke, and then letting it go. Her persistence and whole attitude are what made it weird", "I think all these cats named Mia should be called Mia-ow.", "That's where my mind went.", "Excuse me but that\u2019s my name, your parents clearly named you after me. I was the first Lauren. So were the other four Laurens in my sixth grade class.", "My name is also Lauren and you obviously stole my name!   /S", "We have a friend named Lauren, and a daughter named Lorelei. \n\nShe (seemingly jokingly) tells people we named our daughter after her. \n\nI truly hope she\u2019s joking.", "\ud83d\ude06", "And OP \\*really\\* thinks it's her friend who is the odd one...", "I had a parrot who I named Juanita Gretchen.

Which makes them in their 40s.  I thought at first they were young 20s based on her behavior.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t ask her permission\u2026.  Hysterical to be egotistical enough to think anyone needs permission to use same name as a nickname.", "Oof you're giving creepy and desperate to be the center of attention. Do better.", "And you\u2019re self absorbed", "YTA and also the one that appears a 'little obsessive and odd'. \nGot a mighty big ego there as well to go along with it, automatically assuming she was named after you!", "I think it's the other way around, ur the odd one for thinking her baby is named after u EVEN when your friend said it's not.", "no u", "You're joking, right?", "Why are you thinking it's rude of her to think you are not close enough to name children after each other, when *you* say the *exact same thing*? You agree with her!\n\nYTA. And you come off as *very* obsessive and odd, I might add. Tone it down.", "There is a difference, you're right", "Exactly. Even after being told the child was named after her paternal grandmother (or great-grandmother), OP STILL thought she was factored into the naming decision. Like Melinda couldn't have been more clear that OP wasn't a consideration at all in the naming, especially as it is only the child's nickname that matches OP. And yet OP still thinks it is weird and she was a factor in the naming.", "Exactly, if she'd said something like.\n\n*It's so cool that your baby and I will be sharing a name*.  (notice I don't say named after)\n\nMaybe even say, *I'd like to get her <personalized item>, to celebrate the beauty of the name.*  (tho most personalized items would be for Amelia not Mia)\n\nI think friend would have been receptive to either of those.", "Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldo, aka princess Mia from The Princes Diaries", "I asked her, she approves!", "I know like 5 cats named Mia and no human....", "An award for you Glen Coco!
