While you could have handled it differently (confronting her privately, requesting she take it down, etc.), she posted on social media first and opened the door. It sounds like she might not have included personal details that would have made it possible for people to know that she was talking about you while you presumably did specifically call her out, which is why it might have been more polite to give her a chance to fix it but pretending to have someone else's disability and posting about it isn't exactly a polite way of trying to \"better understand what it's like to be disabled.\" If she didn't want to get crap for telling lies, she shouldn't have lied or posted them for everyone to read.", "NTA she wasn\u2019t doing it to understand you.

What\u2019s beyond the pale is that Zoey wasn\u2019t just pretending to be disabled; she was stealing your experiences and making them public. Sure, it would\u2019ve been kinder to contact her privately and give her a chance to take the blog down, but the sub is \u2018Am I the Asshole?\u2019, not \u2018Did I Act Like a Saint When the Other Person was Being a Massive Asshole?\u2019.\n\nThe reason Zoey gave for her actions is nonsensical, and it\u2019s hard to imagine her being motivated by anything other than attention-seeking. You know what she could\u2019ve done if she really wanted to better understand what it was like to be disabled? She could\u2019ve contacted you or your friends, with a message that began with \u2018Sorry for being an asshole to you guys sometimes in high school.\u2019.\n\nI also want to highlight two groups of people who will benefit from your public exposure of Zoey: (1) Zoey\u2019s friends. Were I in their position, I\u2019d want to know about her behaviour, as it\u2019s a giant red flag; and (2) People with ASD. You all deserve better than having your disability mashed up with other conditions (and goodness knows what else) by a dishonest actor who has no idea what they are talking about. Simply put, she was spreading misinformation about ASD.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThough I do personally think a private conversation would have been less aggressive and hurtful for Zoey, I do totally understand how dreadful you and your friends must feel about your lives being annexed in this way. And a given you only told those who had followed the blog it was karma for Zoey.", "ESH", "NTA. Could you have spoken with her privately? Sure. Same could be said for her. Prior to her blog project she could have reached out and clarified with each of you what she was considering because by not doing so she exposed not only herself but all of you while not even getting it right for all the world to see and dissect.", "Thank you", "Thank you\n\nI agree she was a bit of an attention seeker 20 years ago too. I think she may have wanted to see how people respond to someone with ASD on the internet. It\u2019s still awful", "Thank you. I appreciate it. Im so upset because she shared things we didn\u2019t want shared. But it really shook Anders up", "Thank you", "Thank you", "Thank you", "Thank you.\n\nShe pulled a LOT of crap in high school and always got away with it. But the problem was adults saw honors student and looked away. Problem was back then she didn\u2019t do her own work. And of course her lack of post high school success is testament to that.", "Thank you so much", "Everything she did she told the story first person as if it had happened to her\n\nIt was all a bold faced lie, and she couldn\u2019t even keep her story straight", "Yeah this person is a huge liar and not worth associating with or dealing with. Nta", "You're welcome! All credit to you for wondering if you could've behaved any better in the face of very poor behaviour on the part of the other person. It's no surprise to hear that she has a history of poor behaviour.", "If that\u2019s the case it deserves to be called out. If your going to use other people\u2019s lives for personal projects without permission at least get the story straight.", "Thank you", "I\u2019m loathe to admit she wasn\u2019t even that clever", "NTA.  Calling her out on social media was the only way to get her to acknowledge she's a fraud.  She probably would have claimed it was harming her mental health so she pulled the blog down and getting even more sympathy from her followers.\n\nCheck to see if she's using go fund me or other money raising sites and report her if she is to the sites and law enforcement for fraud.", "NTA. Drag her to hell! Disability fakers are god damn disgusting. Tell everybody she knows what she did, she's definitely using your experiences for her own gain, trash her reputation.", "NTA\n\nShe got exactly what was coming to\nHer", "NTA. Fucking gross. This is no different than people on tiktok faking tourrettes for attention", "NTA she was trying to profit from lies. \nTo be fair she is like nearly 50% of Reddit with the lies. And most the internet", "NTA", ">she\u2019d have taken the blog down if I\u2019d confronted her privately\n\nNo she wouldn't", "ESH. Y\u2019all are all too old for this foolishness. She shouldn\u2019t lie but goddamn who cares? Grow up", "Now that you say that I should", "Thank you", "Thank you", "Thank you", "Because she's a liar and probably profiting off it with people donating things to her. She's also probably talking to people who really have those issues and giving then misinformation.", "Seriously underrated comment. Nearly middle aged people scraping the internet for people they didn\u2019t even like from high school *two decades ago* find some pathetic blog cobbling together semifictional \u201cautobiography\u201d with some bits and pieces remembered about other people. Awkward all around. Technically NTA because Zoey is super yikes, but all this talk of unleashing and taking to social media for whatsoever is just so much energy for someone who seems so contemptibly small, and seems like OP already has all the \u201cNTA\u201d validation they needed.", "It might have been less aggressive to confront her privately,  but she's spreading misinformation. She's probably been profiting from her blog and misappropriating resources from people who really need it. \n\nShe needed to be exposed on social media so her followers know she's a liar and her information is inaccurate at the very minimum.", "I think she's like people who use a phony cancer diagnosis to get money.", "If she ever pulls a stunt like that I will personally report her to the department of health. She has a nursing license and a lie like that can get your credentials revoked", "She should definitely know better then if she's ever used her license.  She's had to have come across people with the same things you and your friends have.  \n\nPretending to have ASD only lets her experience how people respond to her.  If she really wanted to know she could have asked,  done research or worked in the field.  \n\nHonestly I believe she's just another internet scanner looking for money and attention.", "I don\u2019t even know what to say about her", "NTA. She lied. There was a reason for you to share the truth because this was shared publicly without your consent. Actually, it was smart to do this in the public because she shared your stories in public as well. If she kept this privately, then you confront her in private. So sorry you had to deal with those issues with Zoey. Hang in there, move forward.", "NTA\n\nShe lied publicly and got called out publicly....As the saying goes, she fucked around and found out.", "Sounds like [Amanda Baggs](http://abaggs.blogspot.com/) of [Ballastexistenz](https://ballastexistenz.wordpress.com).", "NTA.  \nShe lied publicly about information none of you wanted divulged, all for attention.  \nOnly fair you disavow her publicly.", "Nta, she's really toxic and God punishes those things, she can't lie like that about having disabilities", "I briefly worked with an older man who, after several months of working there, started complaining that his Parkinson's was acting up. Never once saw him shake. I think he tripped in the office once, and that's when he brought it up. Apparently, he had also written a book on the subject. \n\nI don't have a lot of experience with Parkinson's, but I know it's not a thing that comes and goes or has flare-ups. Turns out he also had some really racist music on sound cloud or something.", "Thank you", "Thank you", "Oh no", "Thank you", "Thank you\n\nWorst part is she goes to church and judges the daylights out of the rest of ua", "She died in 2020.", "She's a bully, a hypocrite and peaked in high school, what a loser", "Wait, people LIE?? On the internet?? \ud83d\ude43 If you are taking medical advice from a random person's blog then you deserve whatever happens. As for profiting, that was not mentioned in the post and I highly doubt a random women is making any real profit from her random blog.", "I wasn\u2019t familiar with her until you made this comment", "Oh", "I agree\n\nAnd thank you", "You know people lie. I know people lie. And yet people still get scammed.  \n\nPeople who are undiagnosed or looking to connect with people in similar situations might find her blog. \n\n\nShe's reaching out to people in a not good head space.  It's likely she's making passive income from affiliate links and actively soliciting \"donations\". \n\nShe's gone to a lot of trouble to portray herself this way. It's either for attention or financial gain. \n\nShe mixes up the diagnoses and is putting misinformation out there to a community of people who are often misunderstood.", "It sucks most certainly but you are describing most of the internet. This is why you go to the doctor and not a random person's blog to seek help. At the end of the day, a bunch of 40-somethings (or almost 40) are acting like teenagers and it's sad.", "NTA She went public with her lies and you answered those lies in public.", "How does she think that appropriating and publishing an amalgam of your group's stories would help her better understand disability whether she has one or not?!

Eff that liar.", "NTA She put that in public, don't feel bad to do the same.\nYou don't have to respect her that much since she don't respect your privacy and the condition", "No man you exposed a liar she was faking ASD and I guess at the same time she was reaching for clout and sympathy I would have exposed her right on the spot.", "It's no different than people developing Tourette's for attention on TikTok", "If someone is taking your wallet, you don\u2019t wait to see if they were planning to give it back.\n\nYou post a lie for all to see, you get called out on it the same way.  Simple as that.", "So a bunch of people who have lived with these conditions their whole lives are calling out someone who is lying. Someone who could never empathize with them.  Someone who is now literally stealing their lives and calling it her own for some type of gain be it attention or money. \n\nNo worse than calling out authors who plagiarize,  embezzlers,  or lying politicians.  \n\nMore power to them for outing her.", "NTA at all Zoey deserved it, you slayed", "NTA.", "op=NTA\n\nShe has no right to disseminate YOUR personal stories.\n\nThis wasn't about understanding other people it was about gaining sympathy and attention.  Feck Zoey.", "NTA\n\nShe deserved it. You did the right thing. People like this don\u2019t care, so why should you?", "NTA\n\ni worked with someone who lies ab their disabilities and always used it as an excuse to get out of work. (harsh, but i only say that bc it is a lie. ofc if she truly had what she said, i wouldnt make a fuss ab using it.)\n\none day, we were in a group and she was talking very softly & used \u201cim partially deaf\u201d as an excuse to why she couldnt talk loudly. \n\ni am partially deaf and i would say it occasionally to people bc i didnt want them to think i was rude & not listening. i also do not have a soft voice bc obvi im partially deaf and its hard to know what volume i am speaking at. it wasnt until a few weeks after that she started using the \u201cpartially deaf\u201d as an excuse & it made me mad. my other coworker is also partially deaf & that made her mad aswell. \n\nfor someone to use your disability when you know they dont have it, is very very enraging. exposing her on social media was the right move in my opinion. Especially bc she made a blog to get attention from people. \n\npathological liars & people who fake disabilities for attention are TA.", "NTA this happened recently with a woman on social media who faked having cancer, she got tens of thousands of dollars, funds from non-profit organizations and even befriended a struggling cancer patient just to steal her information and use her story as her own. she got arrested and is now facing criminal charges. it really fucked up to tell someone else's struggles as your own.", "NTA. She used you and your friends for her gain. End. Of. Story. \n\nI'm glad you publicly exposed her.", "NTA. As a diagnosed person this shit drives me nuts. And this is basically every TikTok faker on steroids. I\u2019m glad you shut it down because it\u2019s offensive to those of us with an actual diagnosis.", "She is still the same asshole she was in high school\u2026", "Well then, if she contacts you again about calling her out publicly, give her this: \n\nProverbs 10:9 - Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out.", "You could report her fake blog and everything to the nursing board or her employer. I mean if you want her to really face some consequences. Most hospitals and clinics don't like their staff doing shady shit like that."]}
