Before this move we lived 15 minutes away from my parents and now it\u2019s around 45 minutes. \n\nWhen we were building the house we kept in mind that we wanted an open space that would be good to have family over during the holidays. I told my family that after the house was build we could have thanksgiving and Christmas at our place. My brother (48m) thought this was a good idea since our parents home was started to feel too small for everyone to exist comfortably, especially since our children were getting older and started to bring boyfriends around which meant more people. \n\nDuring the building process my mother (75f) never said anything against us moving or the idea that holidays would be at our place from now on. The house was finished for thanksgiving 2022 and we were ready to host. However my brother phoned me a week before and said mom was adamant about having thanksgiving at her house. I tried to reason with her but she didn\u2019t change her mind so trying to be nice I caved and let her host. As I expected there was not anywhere near enough space. Her living room fit six people and there were fifteen of us, so many sat on the floor or dragged chairs in from other rooms. Again her table only fit six comfortably so we were very squished with no elbow room. \n\nChristmas 2022 I put my foot down. I told everyone we were having it at my place and everyone seemed happy, except my mother. She said it was too far and that she didn\u2019t like to drive it the dark. I told her she could stay in the spare room (which I also offered to her at thanksgiving) and that it was unfair to make everyone cramp into her small house, especially since we have 17 people this year. I told her everyone else was also staying over to be able to drink which they were unable to do last year because they had to drive. She refused saying I was being unreasonable and that if we didn\u2019t come to her, she wouldn\u2019t come. When she looked to my brother to back her up, he sided with me. She\u2019s now upset and refuses to talk to either of us. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nUpdate: She caved for the better our her grandchildren. I sent my youngest daughter (21f) and my niece (17f) to go over to my mothers house to make pies with her. They made a pumpkin pie and an apple pie then drove her over to our place. She and my father stayed the night and seemed to enjoy it.", "created_utc": 1672249281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxfqru/aita_for_telling_my_mother_shes_going_to_do_it_my/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As much as she tried she couldn't handle the amount of work, and expense.", "NTA base on common sense. As families grow, they need more space, and you have space to spare while she doesn't. \n\nBut I don't think that this is about the drive or anything else that she mentioned. I'm betting that she feels like she's being replaced and she's uncomfortable with that. Might I recommend an olive branch of asking her to help with the prep for the holidays?

I can understand not wanting to drive at night and wanting to sleep in your own bed, especially at 75 years old. But no she obviously can\u2019t continue to host, it\u2019s time to pass the torch. I\u2019d make one more attempt to be kind and conciliatory and then let her decide if she\u2019d rather be a martyr or spend time with her family. NTA.", "No obviously NTA here. But despite her being unreasonable, keep in mind that it\u2019s hard for the older generation to let go of the traditional way of things and pass the responsibilities on to the next generation. \n\nThat said, stick to your guns on it and hope she\u2019ll come around.", "Nta she\u2019s being stubborn what\u2019s more important.

When I took over hosting duties for my mom, she fought me fir a few years because she felt like she was being displaced. Was it rational, no, her home and kitchen just couldn't accommodate our growing family. It was a bit of a learning curve to plan and cook such a large meal that I had only been given assigned tasks for but it worked out eventually. I also made sure to have mom bring some of the family recipes that made the holiday meals feel like the traditional ones at her house. Plus picked her brain for what to make ahead and generally made her feel like she was a part of it all.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your mom is the common denominator here.", "NTA", "It kind of sounds like your mom has some other reason for not wanting to do holidays outside of her home?", "Ehh NAH.  Your mom clearly isn\u2019t seeing reason, but I\u2019d feel harsh calling your 75 year old mom an asshole for acting like a stubborn 75 year old woman.  But you\u2019re dead on the money about your reasons for having it at your place.", "At this point in life, laying it on the line and stating this is how it's going to be has taken away the matriarchal role from your mother.  Perhaps a better approach is to invite her to be involved with the prep and planning of holiday meals vs telling her it's your way or the highway.  NAH", "NAH. Your reasons make perfect sense, but I can also see where she might feel hurt.\n\nI think she should have just declined if she didn't want to go, but I do see where she might feel a bit rejected by everyone choosing to drink and have more space at the bigger house over what she probably thought was a tradition everyone enjoyed at hers.", "Soft YTA -  giving this kind of thing up is psychologically hard.   So while I understand why you wanted it at your house, this kind of harsh ultimatum wasn't going to work with her.  I'm 57 and my mom 88, MIL is 77. I understand that these kinds of interactions are challenging.  Please don't worry who the asshole is and find a way to repair the relatoinship", "You need to take a step back and see this from your mom's point of view. What she heard was \"Hey mom. Your house is no longer good enough and you are no longer useful for hosting so I am taking over the holidays.\" That is not what you meant (I hope) but that is what she heard. \n\nBecause you had no actual conversation with her, didn't invite her to help prep or even host but just at your house, I am going to go with a slight YTA.

Your mother will have to adjust to a new tradition or stay home alone.", "NTA. having the holidays over at your house literally isn't a big deal. is your mom the sentimental kind? maybe she's upset traditions are changing. but even still, how she's handling this is unfair and honestly a bit childish", "NTA. She apparently cannot gracefully move on.", "NTA.  And I\u2019m sorry, spouse and I are on our 70\u2019s. Don\u2019t give in to emotional blackmail.

But change is hard on older people sometimes.", "NTA hope you had a good Christmas at YOUR house.", "NTA", "NTA, but letting go of hosting holidays can be really hard and emotional.\n\nThere are a lot of memories in her house, and this change can represent a lot of things and feel like it\u2019s being \u201ctaken\u201d from her before she\u2019s ready. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should keep having holidays at hers, but there may be a more empathetic way to approach this and an opportunity to give her some ownership over the holidays even if they\u2019re hosted at yours.\n\n(Do you like cooking with her? Are there activities she can do to feel like an important and needed part of the event?)", "NTA. I am so tired of people - specifically, older people - who just insist on never changing, despite the world and realities (needs, wants, etc) changing around them.", "NTA \n\nMeanwhile I am questioning whether or not our hosting holidays makes my DIL feel like we are hogging things or if she's ok with it....", "NTA. You built your house with the intentions of hosting for holidays. However, if she's always hosted, I suggest a compromise. My great grandma would always host at her house. Eventually we realized it was hard to fit 40 people in her house for every holiday, especially New Years, Christmas, Thanksgiving when it was cold making the screened in porch unusable. So, the compromise was she was able to host Easter, because even if it was slightly chilly or raining, the screened in porch could be used in addition to front/back living rooms and kitchens. It might make the fight easier to do something like this and allow your mother to host smaller gatherings to give her a sense of being needed and in control. And of course, the pride of being able to provide for everyone.", "Fired, made me lol", "Could she come a day or two early and help? That way she wouldn't feel replaced. Maybe if you'd ask?", "I like this, OP, and agree. When my sister started taking over the hosting duties, she would call my mom 5+ times a day the week before the holiday looking for advice. It made my mom feel really appreciated. About 5 years in, she gifted my sister the huge dining room table that had been in our family for generations. She also no longer drives at night, so one of her grandchildren (early 20s) drives her home, as she likes her own bed. \nTry to include her, but absolutely insist on hosting. It may take a while, but she'll eventually enjoy being served a raspberry bellini and not having to lift a finger! ;)\n\nNAH.", "Age doesn't excuse asshole behavior.

To you it\u2019s practical and a matter of space. But to her, it\u2019s the end of her being the center of the family. Suddenly she\u2019s not needed anymore. Not important. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t done so (and if she\u2019s not insufferable) ask her to come a little early because her help would mean so much to you since she\u2019s been such a wonderful hostess for so long. Emphasize how she can still be in the thick of things without the stress and additional demands and expense of physically hosting. Tell her how much you appreciate her hosting over the years.", "Definitely NTA but neither is your mom.", "NTA. A huge part of hosting is making your guests comfortable, and clearly your mom can't make that many people comfortable.", "NTA!! your Mother is set in her ways and telling you that.", "Yes, you are, a little bit. It sounds like she values being able to contribute to her family's celebrations a lot more than you understand. While your position makes logical sense, it sounds like you crushed her.", "Yea I tried this with an aunt and it went over like a LEAD BALLOON!

She feels this has always been her gig..so gently tread.", "Bit harsh to call the mum a jerk.", "Yep. My late mother insisted (until she finally sold the house) that I and my three brothers, and their wives (at least in David's case his current wife) and their children (gotta have the grandkids) and later, the grandkids' kids came to her until, finally, one Christmas the dinner table, card tables and whatever else were could come up with we insufficient and I wound up literally sitting halfway into the Christmas tree (fortunately artificial).\n\nMomma may not be able to give up Christmas at her place until she literally can't do it anymore.

Jerk is tame", "Sometimes it is so hard for people to let go of the past, traditions, and the way things have always been.  For some, it is easy but for others it is hard. I have lots of memories of my children being in my home for Christmas. As they have grown and want to make their own memories with their kids and beginning a new way of doing things it is hard. My mother had a hard time with us kids wanting Christmas in our own homes and I have had a hard time with my kids wanting Christmas in their own homes. The difference is, I\u2019m not an asshole about it and am understanding that things change and new memories can be made anywhere. Give mom some slack though, she may be having a hard time with it for reasons that you dont understand or what reasons that she isnt even able to understand herself. Im sure in time she will see how much more reasonable it is to do it your way and in time she will probably enjoy that she doesnt have to cook and clean up after. You arent the asshole, but give mom some grace.", "NTA- I understand completely what you're dealing with.  30 yrs later and mine still brings up the fact that we had to move the gathering to Christmas Eve instead of day because we wanted our kids to be able to have a Christmas morning at home.  And now there are great-grands!  Definitely not enough room and only 1 bathroom.  Just include her in as much prep as she wants and is able to do.  She might find herself enjoying the down time and you probably have a full-time gig.", "NTA. Give her a job to do there so she still feels important.", "Nta. Especially when the whole family backs you.", "Definitely this. Mom is being unreasonable, but I don't think this is just about control or not wanting to drive. Hosting holidays probably means the world to her, and it may be making her very sad to be losing that, even if it makes more sense to have it elsewhere.
