He really likes it, and recently my daughter(14F) has been expressing an interest to join.\n\nWe signed her up for a trial class, and I came to the parent's section to watch and see how things were going. It seemed really safe, which was a relief as I was worried that my daughter would get hurt, or that it might be too much for her. But I noticed that during breaks, she was getting really friendly with this other newcomer, a white belt boy.\n\nI didn't really want her to get into dating or relationships at this age, and i was really worried about the influence he might have on her. As a parent, it's my duty to carefully select and vet my daughter's friends, and I wanted to keep her focus on school high, so she will have like-minded friends. Also, as the levels get higher, there will be all sorts of fighting and board-breaking and I'm worried that it'll be too much for her, like she doesn't need to learn that kind of violence and have it change her personality.\n\nWhen we got home I told my daughter that she can't do karate anymore, usually she listens to me perfectly, but today, she started arguing with me, and this only reaffirmed my decision, as I knew the slippery slope of what could happen. She stormed off to her room, but now my son and my wife are both telling me to let her do what she likes and to stop being so controlling, but I'm just looking out for her best interests.

Statically, it\u2019s something like 1 in 5 women who get sexually assaulted, so yeah, she might need some karate. \n\nYou think you\u2019re right and that karate changed her personality to argue with you in one session, other than the more obvious answer that she\u2019s angry with you because you hurt her? \n\nAlso, all the nonsense about her befriending a boy IN A PLACE YOU WILLINGLY TAKE YOUR SON is beyond messed up. \n\nApologize.

Really glad your wife does too.", "The \u201cslippery slope\u201d here is you quickly losing any healthy relationship with your daughter by trying to control another human.

It's part of growing up.\n\nWhat's going to happen is as soon as she's out from under daddy's thumb she's going to go wild doing all the things that you won't let her do now because she's a girl, except she won't have the tools to manage the difficult parts of early adulthood because you won't let her develop them when she's a teenager.  Very unwise", "YTA- I am a black belt in karate. You have no idea the amount of discipline and perseverance it takes to excel at karate.

You taking her out of Karate or \"vetting\" her friends isn't going to stop her from liking boys and talking to them. \n\nTo be frank, your attitude really ticks me off cause you make the rest of us parents look bad. Especially dads if you are one. Time to let your daughter grow up.", "YTA - Why is your son allowed to fight and board break and your daughter is not? Why is this not \u201cliked minded\u201d if your also son does this? My parents put me in Karate as a kid because they wanted me to learn self defence and be able to stand up for myself as a girl. This is a dumb reason to not let your daughter participate in karate. What do you want her to do, sit at home and practice needle point only? \n\nI don\u2019t know why you are bringing up her being friendly to another student. This shouldn\u2019t be a reason to not let her join a sport. Unless this kid is a literal child predator or something this is a non issue. She had a few interactions with a boy and you\u2019re jumping to conclusions. It\u2019s ok to not want her to date at her age but she\u2019s allowed to make male friends.

She is a teenager with hormones. There is nothing you can do to stop this. What you need to do is set rules and be willing to listen to her thoughts and feelings. Unless you want her to go behind your back. I had friends in high school that had parents like you, some of whom ended up pregnant by sixteen. \n3. She is a human being, not property. She will grow up and if you want her to keep a close relationship with you, I would recommend that you give her the same freedoms you gave your son when he was 14.", "YTA,  As a female brown belt in Karate, I can tell you Karate is about self defense not violence.

If she\u2019s 14 she\u2019s gonna be interested in boys (or girls or whoever) and you aren\u2019t going to be able to stop that. It\u2019s a natural part of life. Not letting her do a hobby that is fun and that you\u2019ve let your son do just because there\u2019s a boy there is controlling and hypocritical.

Just keep her in the attic until she dies. YTA", "I hope you're rage trolling but if you're not, YTA without even a shadow of a doubt. It is your duty to protect your daughter from predators and bad influences, not shield her from the entire world unless YOU choose every single person and interaction she has in life. Teaching her self-defense, confidence, and discipline are all very VERY good things and that's what martial arts will do for her. And saying that \"learning violence will change her personality\" is asinine. \n\nYour daughter and wife are right, you're being extremely controlling. Ffs, your daughter just talked to a boy, she didn't rip his clothes off and start passionately making out with him. You're seriously projecting to decide that since she had a friendly conversation with a boy, she's definitely going to have a relationship with him and forget about school and blah blah blah good Lord *calm down.* I'm with you that 14 year olds shouldn't have serious romantic relationships yet, but that shouldn't mean that a 14yo can't talk to anyone of the opposite gender ever.\n\nEdited to add, I notice that you didn't have these same catastrophizing worries about your son when he started learning karate.

You consider it justified to stifle anything that might  not fit your vision of the perfect daughter, with no concern that for her actual desires, convinced that your way is for the best. This is the definition of controlling. The only reasons I can see why your son can learn karate but you daughter can't are sexist ones, so add that to the list of reasons your an ahole. Stop trying to force your daughter into the sexist mold you are envisioning for her by using parental fiat to remove anything that might effect your ideal, and actually treat her as a person instead of a doll that you can decorate as you wish.", "Wow, you are a controlling AH, with horrible parenting skills, and a bad outlook on how to raise your kids. You don\u2019t get to HAND SELECT your kids friends. YTA.", "Jesus christ You are an asshole", "The phrasing of \"usually she listens to me perfectly\" is very telling of your parenting. YTA", "YTA. Sounds like your daughter made a friend in karate class and you felt insecure and over stepped. Just because your daughter got friendly with a boy in class doesn't mean anything. Perhaps she wanted a friend to talk to and practice techniques with. She 14 . By now she should be smart enough to know how to handle boys and knows any rules.

Come to think of it, why did you immediately project a straight relationship onto her? She may like boys, girls, or some permutation thereof - and all of that is perfectly ok. \n\nYour son isn\u2019t ready to date at 16 either.

A few things:\n\n1. Your daughter is 14, obviously she\u2019s starting to become interested in boys. You can\u2019t keep her from dating forever.\n\n2.

Martial arts isn't a new thing either, so you worrying it will be too much for her in the future doesn't make too much sense, she will develop because of it and create a healthy social circle of friends with something she clearly has a passion for. I can't think of anything better for your child growing up.\n\nLet us look at your actions. Sure people have strong worded opinions on your choices, but here is what it comes down to. You are actively isolating your child, and as we established before this is an activity she is showing interest in and would be safe in. It is far more damaging to keep her from doing this stuff, \n\n-because what you may not realise is this is a time for her to develop her personality and interests. You have a chance to be a part of it and support her, you won't stop her from growing up, and holding her back means she will just pursue her interests and decide how she wants to develop without you and your input and won't view you as someone with her best interests at heart in the future. -\n\nIn regards to the boy in her class that's not something you can control about her, maybe she doesn't see him how you do, we wouldn't know because it's only been a trial class, heck he might not even be in the class anymore. But ultimately that doesn't matter because she can be just as interested with people at her school as in her karate class, you can probably express to her you don't want her dating at this age instead of keeping your intentions secret, communication is a lovely thing. \n\nFinally I just want to remark, you are working through the world of parenting, you seem to want to be there for your daughter just as you are for your son. Controlling aspects of someone else's life only creates resentment towards you, that's a given. So pick and choose your battles better than this. You want her to be around like-minded people, but you take her away from her interests. She can still do well in school and take karate. Every kid I know whose parents made school the top priority found it to be a waste of their life, not to say school isn't important but it isn't everything either. \n\nAgain I recommend to not hold her back but instead let her pursue her interests, there is zero need to be taking the actions you are even through your own justifications.", "This is a joke right?", "YTA.\n\nShe's 14, it's normal that she socializes with people her age or a little older.

Perhaps it annoys the hell out of me when a parents puts ridiculous restrictions of female children and not male children??? \n\nBottom line: It's an ah move to allow your son to take Karate and not your daughter. All your reasons make no sense given the fact that your son has been doing it for 3 years.", "He's not trying to send his daughter back to the 50s!!!!! He's trying to bring select 50s misogynistic ideology to his daughter in the NOW. What's so hard to understand about that???!! Gosh darn, have a man explain it to you.", "Why not? Clearly you like that era, you never left.\n\nYTA.", "Well she's not allowed to choose her friends and you seem to live in a world we're it's not dangerous for a woman to walk by herself at night, so yeah, questioning your view in reality seems about right", "You didn't say any of that, but your post says clearly that you're treating your son and daughter differently because your son is a man and your daughter is a woman. Ergo sexism. Ergo making fun of you for being stuck in the 1950s.\n\nIt's 2023. You have *no* **single** ***good*** reason to deprive your daughter from martial art classes she wants.", "What\u2019s wrong with you?", "But you obviously have a 50\u2019s mindset. You need to work on that, before she turns 18 or you won\u2019t see or communicate with her. Cause if you have this attitude about karate which stresses self control, anger management as well as self defense (which everyone should learn) you\u2019re either doing it or will start to have this attitude about other things", "While you as not have mentioned any of those things, you clearly have the same mindset as the 50s culture of how women should be treated, hidden behind a thin facade of what is socially acceptable to say.", ">I'm not trying to send my daughter back to the 50s, what is wrong with you?\n\nFunny, your post says otherwise. So what is wrong with you? \n\nYTA a feel so sorry for every girl who has to grow up with a sexist, misogynistic asshole for a father. Sorry, I have to go now and call my dad thank him he treated me as a person growing up who can do or try out what I want, that he taught me I am just as worthy and capable as anyone else instead of pushing me down and treating as second class, less than.", "Yes, you are because you're just like the sexist assholes back then who insisted on controlling every aspect of girls' lives and believed that they weren't as strong as boys were. Shame on you. I feel sorry for your daughter for having such an awful parent. You're controlling, sexist, and just plain nasty to your own daughter. You're ruining her childhood because you can't stand the idea of her having a life that you can't control.", ">I'm not trying to send my daughter back to the 50s, what is wrong with you?\n\nOf course not, women were allowed to take personal safety classes in the 50s.  You want to take her back to the 1900s.", "You are that controlling though.", "YTA. Did you vet your son's behavior with girls in his class? Do you worry about him getting too friendly with girls? What about the character of his friends?

And she can compete, earn her belts, have fun.", "You\u2019re an awful parent and on the speed road to being cut out of her life as an adult. Very gross comments about women. Women can do anything men can do\u2026 and if you don\u2019t think so you\u2019re a misogynist. Major YTA. Gross guy.", "Why did you ask for advise if you gonna keep arguing with people", "You\u2019re making a mistake. Your daughter doesn\u2019t need self defence classes she needs a hobby or sport or interest and she\u2019s interested in karate. Quit being a dick.
