How's your relationship in general?", "This is a tough one because I would say things like drinks and snacks would be for everyone if kept in the kitchen in a family home. If you have something you want to keep just for yourself I\u2019d suggest keeping it in your room.", "Everyone always has things in the kitchen fridge.

No, replace it or ask.

I recommend you don't bring alcohol into the house at all anymore, not even to keep in your room.

You don't mention your SIL's age, but I'll assume she's in the same age-range as you and your husband?  \n\nFirst, SIL stole your stuff.  (And yeah, as you noticed, she stole your stuff, not her brother's. I'm assuming that's because yours were vodka seltzers, but his were some other kind of alcohol, and she liked yours more?)  That sucks.  Don't take things that you know belong to other people without asking if you can have some.\n\nSecond, you're right to point it out to your husband, because frankly, if SIL came in and drank FOUR vodka seltzers in one night -- that's too much, and SIL sounds like she's on the edge of a drinking problem.\n\nIs there ANY way to get your in-laws to say something to SIL, reminding her not to touch stuff in the refrigerator that isn't hers?", "NTA\n\nI always ask first.

I'm always on the lookout for new cider makers to try!\n\n(Several years ago, Woodchuck Cider in VT put out a seasonal called something like \"Campfire Maple Pancakes\", and it was a little bit smoky, and a little bit maple-y.

So of course they never brought it out again.)", "As a Canadian, I can second the \"liquor isn\u2019t cheap\"!

It\u2019s kind of a polarizing flavor - I love it and think it tastes like apple pie in a glass but some of my friends didn\u2019t like the cinnamon levels. On tap they sometimes would have \u201capple pie\u201d which was just half cardinal cin and half their standard cider. It\u2019s a winter flavor so I\u2019d always stock up in February and ration it until the summer when I\u2019d eventually run out.", "Grew up in atlantic canada, if you had an attitude as a kid, you were always called \"sooky\"", "Me too!

When we got back I opened the fridge and they drank all the red bull(12 cans), all the tea & half the water.

Yeah, that is East of me and that is definitely shocking."]}
