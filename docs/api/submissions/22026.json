But she claims she only drank 2 yet the 4 empty cans were in her bedroom garbage? They cost about $25 for a pack of them (6).", "Yes sort of. We are currently living with my In laws waiting for our house to be ready and she lives here too.", ">They cost about $25 for a pack of them (6).\n\nBased on the costs, NTA to bring it up.  She should have asked.", "we talk about 6% alcohol cans right? I mean did she really even need so much in one go for no good reason . Sounds bit like she did it on purpose only to spite you somehow. How's your relationship in general?", "This is a tough one because I would say things like drinks and snacks would be for everyone if kept in the kitchen in a family home. If you have something you want to keep just for yourself I\u2019d suggest keeping it in your room.", "Everyone always has things in the kitchen fridge. I can confidently say that I have never eaten or drank someone else\u2019s things from the fridge without asking (aside from the things that his parents by consistently) anything \u201cspecial\u201d like a nice desert, take out, alcohol, or things that aren\u2019t typically in the fridge none of us touch without asking.", "She drank all your alcohol. Without your permission. Then proceeded to make you feel bad about her poor choice. \n\nThis smacks of alcoholism (stealing for alcohol, drinking alone, lying to cover for drinking). The best thing you can do is not keep alcohol anywhere in your home from now on, and help SIL when she bottoms. \n\nYou have expressed your opinion. Once done that all you get. So for now I\u2019d drop it. \n\nNah", "NTA some people are terrible and lack manners, your SIL included", " NTA- but I\u2019m betting this isn\u2019t the 1st time hiding alcohol", "NTA... my personal rule is I'm fine if you have one or two of something of mine, but if you take all of it - especially the last of something - I get unreasonably irate. That's some disrespectful shit right there and I'm not down for it.", "Is she generous with alcohol with others?", "If you were over 30 or so years old, I\u2019d say yes you are BUT early 20\u2019s \u2026.Nah.

No, replace it or ask. Especially cause I like a local hard cider that is significantly more expensive than my sharing cider(which is angry orchard btw) and if someone drank all of that without even asking I would be pissed and expect a new box of it(they come in four packs but priced like a 6 pack)", "There\u2019s your answer \u2026 you may have to find some consensus with your partner about boundaries", "You have alot going on in your life rn , you have rights to be at SIL and I agree with being upset with her. \n\nDo you feel like conflict with her and possibly his parents is worth the extra time it would take up in your life?", "Never take the last one.", "Are you like, an actual human adult?", "House rule at our house is if there's several anything help yourself to one or 2.

You drank all 4 of my drinks. Didn't leave me any. Had you left me 2 or asked or offered to replace them or literally anything... it would be totally fine.\n\nThe big deal is not checking and not leaving me any.

I recommend you don't bring alcohol into the house at all anymore, not even to keep in your room.  Yes, that sucks, but SIL isn't behaving normally about it and it's better to avoid this kind of problem altogether.", "> sooking\n\nDid this happen in Eastern Canada? Lol", "NTA. She was rude. My brother used to pull that and not replace it. His wife found out and made him replace it.", "No actually! We are in the states lol", "I'm wondering if she didn't actually lie, but had someone over and they each had 2 drinks each or something.

( Since she didn't bought them she should have not touched them but this way there really is no excuse when it's labeled with your name on it)"]}
