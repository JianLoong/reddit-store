You did ask if there were any dietary restrictions. Something like no alcohol should have been mentioned at the time you asked. It isn't like you snuck it in just to screw up his sobriety.\n\nMost people with allergies are going to speak up really quick when asked that question. The same should have happened with alcohol. They need to learn how to use their words instead of expecting people to just magically know.", "I guess you can\u2019t use vanilla in anything you serve recovering alcoholic boy, either. And so much for beer battered fries or onion rings. Oh, I have a really good barbq recipe that uses 24 ounces of Fosters in the sauce. So that would be off the table, too\u2026\n\nYea. No. If this guy falls off the wagon, it\u2019s not because you served him a slice of lazagna. Tell him to try again. He is looking for an excuse. NTA", "NTA OP.  He should have said something about it when you were asking about dietary restrictions, and your cousin\u2019s side of the family are major @$$holes for putting the blame on you when you had clearly asked about dietary restrictions.", "Easy NTA on this one.", "NTA at all. Dude sounds like he's already off the wagon and is looking for someone else to blame. Like, the amount of undercooking required to even end up with alcohol in the final dish....", "NTA. They should have told you he was an alcoholic. Accidentally consuming alcohol, especially as an ingredient in a dish, is not a relapse. He\u2019s still sober. If finding out that he accidentally consumed sauce with some wine in it causes him to relapse, that\u2019s an issue he needs to take up with AA/his therapist, not you.", "NTA. Im guessing he is only beginning his journey of conquering his addiction cause this response is not in keeping of someone who is in a good place with alcohol.", "NTA. Red wine in a sauce 100% doesn't count as 'relapsing' and these fucks need to grow up. It's this shitty cultish behavior that discourages people from entering recovery in the first place and alienating loved ones over breaking some unspoken illogical rules certainly doesn't foster a supportive enviroment. Fuck your cousin and her weak ass bf.", "You can't even taste the alcohol haha. \n\nRelapsed because of lasagna? \n\nNTA. Not even close. \n\n1) they should have told you if he was that nit-picky.\n\n2) lots of foods are cooked with alcohol, but again...you can't even taste it.", "NTA. Whenever people ignore the restrictions request, they are their own enemies. Also, if something is SUPER important, like if you're allergic to something, you better ask twice. So since they didnt - they didnt care. The fact they had a rant about it afterwards makes them AH", "The alcohol in wine used to cook evaporates off almost completely and when the food is ready to serve there is virtually no alcohol left, just the flavor imparted by the wine. Alcohol has a very low evaporation temperature. The cooking temp is high enough to evaporate pretty much all of it out quickly, long before the food is served.", "NTA, as others have said, the burden as the recovering alcoholic is on him.", ">I tried to explain that I had no idea he couldn\u2019t have alcohol (people were asked about dietary restrictions as part of the planning process)\n\nFull stop. You don't go to a restaurant, order a dish your allergic too and tell no one until you get your food and then expect them to READ YOUR MIND!\n\n# NTA. \n\nThey should've came forward when asked the first time about dietary restrictions. Also there's a difference between cooking wine and regular wine. Cooking wine tends to be higher in alcohol, coming in at around 16 to 17 percent. This is intentional, since alcohol burns off during cooking\u2014 the higher the alcohol level, the longer it takes to burn off.\n\nSo if you had used regular bottled wine or boxed wine, the alcohol would've burned off really quickly. If you really want the flavor of the wine, there's a few other alternatives' that might work! Grape Juice and Vinegar, Stock, Broth or Bouillon, Tomato Juice.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you didn't even know he was a recovering alcoholic. Going by this, and by the fact that simmering for 5 hours likely did cook off all the alcohol, I can't see how this would be a problem.\n\nHaving said that, if the flavor is enough to trigger someone, they should absolutely be responsible enough to ask before consuming something if they are concerned about it. It certainly isn't the responsibility of the rest of the world to make all food safe for alcoholics. If I can take the time to ask if there are nuts in desserts (and I just don't like nuts in desserts), an alcoholic should be taking the time to check before eating a dinner made by someone else. Imagine if they hadn't bothered to ask for the recipe. They'd never have known.\n\nOh, and your cousin and her bf suck for lashing out at you. Tell them, and whomever is on their side, to go suck eggs.", "NTA. Anyone with diet restrictions needs to ask and be responsible for those restrictions. Hard stop.", "NTA. FWIW I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic.", "NTA. He\u2019s dumb. It\u2019s quite common to make lasagna with wine and as an alcoholic it\u2019s his responsibility to check. Btw I know alcoholics who accidentally ate alcohol. If they were truely in the mindset of recovering, it was not great but not horrible either. It sounds like he\u2019s struggling, lashing out and not taking responsibility. That\u2019s one of the biggest symptoms of alcoholism. Ignore him.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t serve alcohol. You served a dish that used alcohol in the preparation stages that was no longer present when the dish was eaten. They\u2019re angry at you for literally no reason, and I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re not very bright either, or they would understand the difference between drinking alcohol and eating a dish prepared with alcohol.", "NTA\n\nThey failed to disclose a dietary issue when asked if there were any.  This is 100% on them.", "NTA. The alcohol content was cooked out during the preparation. If he\u2019s responsible for his own recovery, he should be asking ahead of time if the food that\u2019s been prepared by a stranger contains any alcohol. That\u2019s what I do. I don\u2019t make it everyone else\u2019s responsibility to assume what I can and cannot eat. I choose not to eat things prepared with alcohol, because I\u2019m an alcoholic who\u2019s been sober for 9 years, and it\u2019s a personal choice\u2026 but I ASK. It\u2019s my job to make sure what I\u2019m putting into my body doesn\u2019t contain alcohol. I wouldn\u2019t bat an eye over a lasagna sauce that was prepared with wine but simmered for 5 hours\u2026 it\u2019s just a non-issue. If they have issues that serious with simple food preparations, then it\u2019s THEIR job to check ahead of time.", "Man, was I about to scold you.

This is some weird crazy family drama.  Seems like the best way to deal with any further strife is to set some hard boundaries: you asked for dietary restrictions and they didn't say anything about alcohol, you didn't serve alcohol anyway since it was long boiled off, and now you know, you of course won't even use it if they're coming over.  Keep it adult, don't let them bully you, disengage quickly, politely, and finally.  If you're lucky they will realize you can't be bullied in this way and they'll move on.

He is probably one of them.", "Yep, agreed. \n\nThey are probably morons and don't understand.", "Exactly. In fact following any reasonable recipe about 5% of the alcohol will remain. 250 ml of vodka for vodka lasagne is probably the most alcohol infused lasagne dish. That means 12.5 ml is left in the entire pan. Eight servings yields 1.57 ml vodka per serving. Using 100 proof vodka each serving would contain 0.80 ml alcohol. This in itself isn\u2019t relapse material. What is concerning to this writer is the potential risk if the person was on Antabuse. Again unlikely to trigger a reaction as 5-10 mg per 100ml is generally thought required. \nThat\u2019s the science. Obviously there\u2019s more to it than that.

A host is absolutely obligated to respect those limitations.NTA.", "I 100% agree.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s important to note, in cooking, it\u2019s not the actual alcohol that triggers an addict. Even the flavors of alcohol can trigger someone in recovery. Something as innocuous as the knowledge of alcohol being used to make something can trigger someone. Different people have different tolerances for this sort of thing, so I would not knowingly serve even something like vodka sauce to someone who is sober without telling them first. My brother is an alcoholic and he wouldn\u2019t even eat jarred vodka sauce even though vodka is flavorless and jarred sauces are not often not made with vodka.\n\nOf course, you have to know someone is a recovering alcoholic before warning them.

I don\u2019t eat things with raw alcohol like desserts but cooked the amount of residual alcohol is very minimal (about 25% of the total alcohol content remains after cooking for an hour, for the entire amount so if you put in 1 cup of wine in an entire sauce the amount each person got was minuscule) and it was his job to tell OP they don\u2019t drink.  He is abdicating responsibility for his own sobriety and frankly may be looking for excuses or needs to call his sponsor because shit happens)", "Wouldn't it? \n\nIt would go down in history as the dumbest relapse excuse ever.", "Lmao yes they do, I've been there and done that... but it's not right and it's entitlement, it was just the first thing that popped into mind XD", "Fair point. I'm sure if she had known, she would have ommitted the wine.", "That's what I was thinking!  Like he's been gearing up for a relapse and now he's going to make this his excuse and try to blame it all on OP!", "Right?  I'm in recovery myself and also an addictions counselor.  It's so much of a non-issue that during all our pre-holidays groups, it's not even brought up.  Eating something which was COOKED with alcohol should have NO impact on a person in recovery.\n\nGiving someone a drink with alcohol in it and not telling him?  Maybe asshole, as many of us are triggered by the effects of even one DRINK.  Simmered sauce containing wine?  Gimme a fucking break.  That's someone looking for an excuse to relapse", "I agree it's the entitlement that's not right. Especially when the allergen is in the name or description of the meal.

Never relapsed or even worried about it because I work a program of recovery and so not want to screw up my life again.

Sure usually there's still some.  But a quick search with Google sensei tells me that after cooking for 3 hours there's no alcoholic content remaining.  He should educate himself first.  Then advise he can't have anything with alcohol.  No explanation needed.  People do this for many reasons.  Just a simple 'please let me know anything made with alcohol so I can skip it\" is enough.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know, how can it possibly be your fault.
