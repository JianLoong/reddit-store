On the trip is me, my boyfriend, dad, his girlfriend, dad\u2019s cousin + family, and my best friend, \u201cGabe\u201d.\n\nA few days ago in town, we ran into a business associate of my dad\u2019s that is also a family friend. He invited my dad to dinner, which was meant to take place yesterday. My dad said he would take me and Gabe to the dinner, but said I couldn\u2019t bring Jake, because while the dinner was social the guys always end up discussing work/business and it\u2019s confidential stuff.\n\nI completely understand why he couldn\u2019t go but I didn\u2019t want to leave him at the house with the cousins since he didn\u2019t know them. I asked Jake and he said he would feel better if I stayed back, so I told my dad if Jake couldn\u2019t come I would skip the dinner and stay with him. My dad and Gabe were annoyed by this and said it\u2019s important that we present a united front, and that our friend was bringing his daughter and wife and I should be there as part of the family. I said I didn\u2019t feel right leaving Jake and dug my heels in.\n\nMy dad said he was disappointed in my behaviour but let it go, but Gabe was really annoyed. He said if Jake wasn\u2019t okay on his own for a few hours then he needed a babysitter bit a girlfriend, and that I shouldn\u2019t turn into one of those girls who snubs their family for a boyfriend. He brought up that my dad\u2019s girlfriend was fine not going to the dinner, which is true. We argued for a bit and now we\u2019re sort of not speaking. \n\nI know it was inconvenient that I skipped the dinner (it was considered a bit of a snub) and I normally wouldn\u2019t make such a choice but it\u2019s just because Jake is my guest on the holiday.

Hopefully you and Jake had a great night!  NTA", "NTA, unless you are involved in the business I'm not sure how you being there was any worse than your BF being there......your Dad decided to turn the invite into a business meeting & unless you are integral to that business why should you go.  \n\n\nUltimately your BF is who you are looking to create a future with not your Dad's business......on holiday I'd spend time with my GF rather than my or her family at a business meal.", "nta, maybe this is just me bc i have really bad social anxiety but me and my fianc\u00e9 have been together for almost 11 years and have a kid and i still don't like being left alone with his family", "Dad wants you involved. He wants to pass it to you and Gabe as a couple. He needs you at these meetings so you know what's going on", "Tbh your dad should've accepted the dinner invite in the 1st place. If he would accept he should've said \"I'm not sure if my daughter or Gabe will be coming but I'll ask and confirm\". \n\nI say NTA for your and you did the right thing since Jake was invited to the trip. AH is your dad in this case for accepting the invite on your behalf without even asking. If you were under age, I would've accepted it but you are 25 and you are more than capable of making your own decisions.", "YTA. This is about family income and ultimately your inheritance. The money you spend comes from somewhere. Don't screw with it.", "Gabe works for my dad, so yes. I\u2019m not part of the business but I\u2019m also close enough that I\u2019m privy to information. It\u2019s not government/legally classified, it\u2019s just stuff they don\u2019t talk about around people they don\u2019t know", "She\u2019s VERY nice window dressing but they\u2019re not serious and this was a \u201cfamily\u201d thing", "In what?", "It was *for* business but it\u2019s what they always end up talking about lol\n\nI would have gone if Jake had known the cousins a bit better but it\u2019s only been four days, it seemed a bit rude to just leave him there.", "(Did you mean to say it's out of place to plan a business dinner on a family vacation? OP did specify this was vacation.) Totally agree with you. Planning a business dinner would be inappropriate but at least she could have organized with her bf in advance if they knew in advance that this was happening. But seems like this was an impromptu dinner because they bumped into each other while on vacation, and OP isn't even in the business. So it's actually a strange combo of a social  meetup with a family friend AND a business dinner at the same time, because apparently OP's dad and the friend cannot be in the same room without talking about private business things.\n\nHonestly it just seems like a show of dominance by OP's dad and his friend here. They could have made this work if they agreed to have dinner all together but not talk about business. They could have made this work if OP's dad went out to dinner alone with his friend to talk about business. But instead, OP's dad has to do some weird quasi-social-quasi-business dinner that necessitates treating their guest (OP's bf) like an unwelcome interloper. \n\nJust very rude on the part of OP's dad, really.", "He works for my dad, so he\u2019s in the business. His cousin *could* hear it but doesn\u2019t know the guy and works in a different industry so no point in him coming. \n\nI\u2019m not mad Jake wasn\u2019t invited, I just think after only four days of knowing everyone it would be rude to leave him there for the evening. If the dinner was at the end of the trip I probably would have gone, because Jake might have been a bit more comfortable", "It\u2019s not government classified information \ud83d\ude02 99.9% of people aren\u2019t going to hear anything and do anything with the information, but you don\u2019t necessarily want to talk about business deals in front of near strangers, right? In front of family it\u2019s fine.", "Seems like Dad wanted more related ornamentation in the dinner. It's probably old-school showing that you're a good family guy (which is why business associate brought his wife and daughter). He probably wanted OP to attend more than Gabe.\n\nI guess people do this instead of the mid-century practice of inviting your boss over to dinner (to a wife-cooked meal).", "Is OP Shiv Roy?", "He works for my dad and they\u2019re very close", "ok I understand. So only family is authorized, that's why your \"new\" boyfriend is not yet part of the family \n\nI would say NTA but I'm not the good person to say that : I have a social phobia so I can't stay with \"strangers\". And when we met, sometimes my husband left me alone with his family. I was very angry at him so, I just imagine your boyfriend alone for several hours with people he doesn't know, not knowing when they're serious or joking... If you don't have parts in the society, you have no obligation to go. You father can understand.", "I'm guessing that he wanted you along because the friends wife and daughter were going to be there too, and he wanted you to entertain them while the friend, Gabe and him were discussing business. Probably so that the friend wouldn't get as much flak from his family about them being dragged along to a business dinner while on vacation.\n\nDo you think there will ever be a point where your dad will be comfortable having these discussions around your boyfriend? Like maybe if you got married?\n\nIf you don't think he ever will get that comfortable, then he should maybe start getting used to you not beng his entertainment commitee. If he really needs someone for that, he should be working on getting comfortable with his GF hearing those conversations, so that ahe can play that role.", "No it wasn't, if it was your bf could have tagged along. It was a business thing, and a rather old fashioned at that.", "In you", "that's what it looks like to me, too.  that your dad wished you ended up with gabe, so he's enabling this bullshit excuse to drive a wedge between you n' your boyfriend.", "The trip might be business for the organiser, but not for the family.\n\nI take my wife and kids on worktrips, but dont expect them, or the guest to be a part of the business functions.\n\nHard lesson to learn,  but his little girl is growing up", "it's still pretty weird that gabe was invited and not your boyfriend.  they can't just ... *not* talk about their secret stuff at a meal? they'd be talking about it in front of you, and other people not  involved in the business, and it's just pretty damn weird to exclude your boyfriend on that basis.", "Okay, that\u2019s some important context. I thought he was just someone in your friendzone\n\nETA NTA btw. Enjoy your holiday!", "Pretty much, which is totally fair, but leaving him was a bridge to far for me because like you, I would be *livid* if he left me alone with his family.", "Well, he\u2019s not family, ergo not invited either way. But old fashioned, yes it certainly is \ud83d\ude02", "Highly unlikely \ud83d\ude02", "Yup. Trying to exclude the boyfriend and then getting worked up when it fails.", "Haha that would be wild if he was just randomly on the family holiday \ud83d\ude02 no he\u2019s my dad\u2019s heir apparent, definitely not a friendzone entourage \n\nThank you!", "So you did exactly what you needed to do. It's important to respect each other in a relationship. Gabe was really incorrect in his comment about the \"babysitter\", it's really disrespectful for Jake", "Gabe is also not family, hence business", "My dad considers Gabe like a son to him. He\u2019s not blood family, but I\u2019d never make that distinction", "Are you and Gabe part of dad\u2019s business? Was this actually a required work event? Gabe is being an ass saying you are ditching \u201cyour family\u201d for a boyfriend. You were right to not abandon a guest for an exclusionary dinner for the In Crowd.", "Gabe works for my dad. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a work event, it was a social dinner with a business associate.", "You did the right thing."]}
