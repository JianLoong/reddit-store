Jim is a perfectionist and lately he's been frustrated because he feels I'm slacking on staying on top of things around the house and tells me there's no excuse for the house to not stay immaculate at all times.\n\nDev is the best baby, but he does not sleep at night. My 3rd trimester was rough, and it's been nearly 6 months since I've slept through the night. Dev is breastfed, so I do all the overnights with him while Jim sleeps, he typically gets 8-10 hours of sleep per night. I also take care of Dev during the day. Jim takes Dev for an hour or so when he gets home and I use that time to try and rush to catch up on chores so Jim and I don't argue.\n\nJim is quick to point out when i don't do something, for ex: in the kitchen I'll wash dishes, clean the stove, wipe counters and table, organize pantry, sweep the floor, but I won't have the energy to mop. Instead of acknowledging all I do around the house, Jim constantly points out what i don't do: I see you can't be bothered to mop the floor. Must be nice to do nothing all day. I wish I could stay home and be lazy. You have no excuse for this! (And it goes like that across all the household chores.)\n\nI try to explain to Jim I'm constantly exhausted, I'm dealing with chronic pain issues, ehlers danlos, osteoarthritis, pots, mcas, gastroparesis, and neuropathy. Plus I've struggled on and off for years with anxiety, depression and ptsd. (I have a therapist.) Jim points out that when he's at home he does his share of the chores with no problem and he works full time, so me being home all day means I should be able to do everything just by myself and take the stress off him.\n\nWhen Jim gets mad he gets very snarky too. He'll ask me if I capable of taking care of Dev since I'm obviously inept at taking care of the house. Says he hopes I don't neglect Dev like I neglect my other responsibilities. That he will take Dev and leave if I don't get my act together and start doing better. And it goes on.\n\nI finally got fed up and snapped at Jim to shut up and leave me alone. That he gets actual sleep every night and has far more energy than I do. I'm doing my best and I'm sorry it's not good enough, but please leave me alone about it.\n\nJim got upset and accused me of attacking him when he's just trying to help and make sure I don't forget what needs to be done. And he doesn't know if he wants to stay in a relationship with someone who attacks him that way and clearly doesn't care about anything in life.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675577740, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u5n2c/aita_for_snapping_at_my_husband/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds so familiar to what I went through when I left my husband when our daughter was around 6 months old.  It sounds like he isn't helping with the baby and is putting you down while you are trying to do everything, which is very confusing  since this is supposed to be your partner who loves and cares about you and should help support you when you need help sometimes. Was he like this before you guys had the baby? This is what abusers do and even therapy together may not do anything.  For me,  I had gotten used to my husband treating me like this for years,  but when we had the baby,  it came to a head and helped me realize how unfair it was to be treated consistently this way. I also left because I refused to let my kid grow up seeing a woman (me) treated like this and thinking it is normal.   In my case,  my husband kept belittling me,  was so focused on just himself during my entire pregnancy and FMLA leave and continued being a massive ass even when I started back to work and juggled work,  pumping milk all the time, cleaning the house, and he rarely could even wash a bottle or watch the baby so I could catch a nap ever.  He'd even comment how I should be making more money at my job so he could just be a SAHD and he resented my parents watching the baby (basically for free) while  we were at work (he had helped me with none of the research and had 0 interest in trying to find childcare). Of course,  asking to do joint therapy was laughed off. There were other red flags,  too, and the divorce took forever,  but it was the best thing for me and (edit:our) kid (who is now several years older). My child sees her dad somewhat regularly (we have a regular schedule that he doesn't commit to at times) and he is the \"fun dad\" -- better than her seeing him as the a-hole dad who name calls mom and treats mom like garbage. I went to solo therapy immediately when I left him and it was worth its weight in gold to be able to get stronger to face him emotionally during the divorce. \n       Why am I sharing all this? Because IMO it's likely Jim will continue to be this way to you and there isn't a magic fix unless he genuinely  wants to be a better partner to you,  which it seems like he doesn't.  You've already been direct with him multiple times . You said he's threatened once to take the baby. Does that sound like like a caring supportive partner? That's not right and I'm sorry.
