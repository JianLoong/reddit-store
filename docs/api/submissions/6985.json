Last night we got a hotel for the last night before we drove home, and my fianc\u00e9e and I were in the master bed and my daughter was in the pull out couch bed in the next room, and shortly after we went to sleep, my daughter asked if she could sleep in my bed with me. My daughter is on the spectrum and has anxiety from previous trauma and has some trouble with being alone in unfamiliar places, so I said absolutely and I initially offered to go sleep on the pull out couch with her but she said it was very uncomfortable and she needed to sleep on a real mattress. I asked my fianc\u00e9e if she\u2019d be willing to sleep on the pull out couch for the night, and she seemed a little annoyed. I offered to get another room for us or to figure something else out, but she insisted it was ok. So my daughter and I shared the master bed and my fianc\u00e9e slept on the pull out couch.\n\nToday we got home and she\u2019s seemed kind of passive aggressive with me and when I asked what was wrong, she said she felt completely sidelined and like she was treated with no respect or decency last night. I told her I was sorry but my daughter was in distress and I needed to do something, and she insisted she\u2019s not a little kid and could\u2019ve done something else that didn\u2019t involve sleeping in my bed with me. Then I told her she was starting to get out of line and she needs to understand I have an autistic daughter so if we\u2019re going to be together, she needs to understand stuff like this will happen from time to time. She got very annoyed with me and then walked off.\n\nAITA?\n\ntl;dr: autistic daughter was nervous sleeping in our hotel room and hated the feeling of the pull out couch so she asked to sleep in my bed with me, which put my fianc\u00e9e on the pull out couch and she feels undignified and disrespected for it.\n\nETA: something I should\u2019ve mentioned in the post is that we did talk about it and she said she\u2019d sleep on the couch. We talked about it this morning and she said she didn\u2019t want to come between us so she\u2019d sleep on the couch, but bit off more she could chew.\n\nBut in hindsight, yeah it wasn\u2019t cool of me to not get two beds.", "created_utc": 1673371393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108fcym/aita_for_asking_my_fianc\u00e9e_to_sleep_on_the_pull/", "score": 4842, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or at 16, is it equally if not more important that she begins learning how to deal with discomfort and self soothe, and comes to terms with not always getting her way? The world isn\u2019t going to cater to her limitations, nor should she be taught to expect that in every situation. Sending your fianc\u00e9 to an uncomfortable pullout to sleep alone while your daughter takes her place in bed with you is not appropriate or respectful.\n\n-Daughter takes comfortable bed and you share pull out with fiance.\n\n-You rent separate room/proper bed for daughter or at bare minimum fianc\u00e9, instead of relegating her to pullout.\n\n-You move to room with two beds so daughter has her own and you are close, but still in bed with fianc\u00e9.\n\nJust about any other option would have been better, more respectful of your fianc\u00e9 and the position she now holds in your life, and should have been ample consolation to your daughter. Completely ceding to her and giving her her way is not the answer here. Are we sure no part of this was her asserting ownership of you and intentionally pushing fianc\u00e9 to the side? If she was attempting to put a wedge between you, she succeeded. Her behavior seems borderline manipulative. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not thrilled about having to share your attention and affection with another woman. But she\u2019s going to have to learn to deal with it in a healthy and respectful manner.\n\nAutistic or not, 16 is old enough to learn healthy boundaries and make peace with not always getting one\u2019s way. You offered many compromises that should have solved the problem. Do not allow your 16 year old daughter to hold you hostage or come between you and your partner. Autism is not an excuse here. You\u2019re responsible for raising her to survive and thrive in a world that won\u2019t always be so accommodating, and you\u2019re now also responsible for respecting and considering your partner\u2019s needs and feelings, too.", "NTA. If i was in the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoes, would this situation annoy me a bit in the moment? absolutely. But in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. It was a small inconvenience. And I personally would look at my fianc\u00e9 funny if he let his autistic daughter struggle/feel uncomfortable when she didn\u2019t have to. This is such a small sacrifice to make, and he offered to get her another room with a bed which she said no to, so i\u2019m really failing to see why ppl think he\u2019s in the wrong here (besides the \u201cout of line\u201d comment he made later to his fianc\u00e9e). If she was so bothered by couch sleeping she should\u2019ve said yes when he offered her an alternative. Ppl saying the daughter should\u2019ve slept in the bed with the fianc\u00e9e are also missing something: We don\u2019t know the nature of the relationship between the fianc\u00e9e and the daughter, and we don\u2019t know how comfortable she would\u2019ve been sleeping with the fianc\u00e9e given her history with anxiety and autism.\n\nBooking a room with multiple beds in the future is smart to prevent issues like this. You did right by your kid and anyone who feels some type of way or looks at you funny because of that can kick rocks.\n\nEdit: There were a few comments saying the dad should\u2019ve slept on the pull out with the daughter, but did you all read over the fact that this was his very first solution? We also don\u2019t know how hard he pressed his daughter about just sleeping on the couch and not waking up the fianc\u00e9e. the Y T A judgements on this one is interesting.\n\nEdit 2: People using their anecdotal experiences with autism (either having it themselves or having kids with it) You do realize that everyone\u2019s autism is different in terms of severity and whatnot?

I am on the spectrum myself so I completely sympathize with having a daughter who is autistic. It manifests in countless ways. With previous trauma and sensory issues I think it is expected there will be times when your daughter will need your attention in ways that allistic (neurotypical) people don't understand, as evidence in the comments of alluding to you being \"creepy\" for sleeping in a bed with your daughter or saying she's \"too old\" to act that way and even insinuating that she's doing it on purpose to mess with your relationship. I take offense to that on your behalf. Autism is a disability. Our brains are atypical. Even being moderately or mostly \"able\" is an enormous struggle. A father isn't \"creepy\" for letting his \\*autistic\\* daughter share a bed in the same hotel room \\*as his fiance\\*.\n\nI think you were very reasonable handling what you were dealt with in this scenario. You intended to sleep on the pullout couch first and when that was an issue, you \\*asked\\* your fiance rather than demanding she sleep on the couch, you could see she was upset and offered to get an additional room so that she was comfortable and she declined. You did right by your daughter by allowing her to feel safe and comfortable in an unfamiliar situation.\n\nAll of that being said I think you should have a bit of compassion for your fiance. Blended families are difficult to navigate. It sounds like your fiance may not fully understand what autism is and how it manifests so it must have been irritating to feel like she was kicked out of her own bed. Just the comment about your daughter's age tells me you need to have an in-depth conversation about things she should expect if you are both going to be together for a long time. Autism is one of those things that can throw a wrench in any plan that neurotypical people make at any time. Most (daresay all?) autistic people do not have additional expendable mental energy to play games with people's relationships or do things just to be unkind or be ugly. That's mostly in the wheelhouse of neurotypical people who intuit inter-personal relationships better.", "YTA - if you couldn\u2019t join your daughter on the pull out you should have went to sleep on it.

I am recently discovering I mask a lot (audhd here), and part of this is that I cite tiredness as a reason I have to leave party's early, just for example. The real reason is that it's gotten too hard to follow conversation and the loud music has made me overstimulated and my outfit isn't quite right and I'm feeling too sweaty plus 10 other things... \n\nSure, the kid did even mention that the bed wasn't so comfortable, which makes me think even less that it was manipulative, and instead just a contributing reason to feeling insecure and unsafe and uneasy in a new environment.

All people need to have ways to self soothe and it's their parents responsibility to teach them. There's no telling if she'll have her dad to comfort her in 5/10/15/etc. years.

In consequence, I don't go very many places because a potential poor night's sleep in a hotel outweighs the value of most trips.

Maybe they were concerned about price, or more likely it was just EASIER to suck it up for the night and sleep on the bed that was already available, without having to pack up, move some of their stuff, go to the front desk, etc etc. For people asserting that OP \"asked\" not \"demanded\" the fiancee to take the pull-out and thus they're not the A H are failing to see that OP put the fiancee in a no-win situation.

Your daughter needs to learn and understand that her needs won't always be met with top-tier accommodations. This doesn't mean you should completely ignore her needs/wants, there has to be a like drawn with how far you'll go to meet those needs/wants. Cause if you constantly give in to those needs/wants that possibly makes your fianc\u00e9e feel disrespected/uncomfortable, then your daughter -- once she's older -- will go out into the world assuming that her needs/wants will be accommodated no matter what. You should also educate your fianc\u00e9e (if you haven't already) on having a child on the spectrum and how she should treat your daughter. Your fianc\u00e9e also needs to feel all the love and respect she deserves in order to have balance: loving and respecting your fianc\u00e9e while also doing the same with your daughter but with lines, especially for your daughter.\n\nI am speaking mostly from experience from this situation. My parents did meet my needs to a degree, as in they left room for me to grow on my own and learn to 'accommodate' myself so that i didn't expect for my needs to be perfectly met anywhere i went (with or without them). I also had to have my dad sleep in my room in my sister's bed (which was empty since my sister slept on the living room floor by my mom for a few years of her tween life) till i was 12 or 13 cause i had trouble falling asleep and struggled with other things when going to bed in the first place.

All people can experience pain when they aren't accommodated.", "Yeah, my partner and his kids are autistic and he's told me his daughter will probably always live with us", ">Dad needs to understand that a 16 year old girl should not be sleeping in the same bed as her father\n\nOkay, I understand in OPs specific scenario why kicking the partner out for the kid was a big no but .... Why can't a child share a bed with their parent? What do you think is going on between them that makes that inappropriate?\n\nI'm 29, and if the situation arose where I needed to share a bed with my dad (and it didn't kick his wife out of the bed), I would do it. We still cuddle on the couch together like we did when I was little (granted, rarely, as we're often with both his wife and my fiancee when at either home, but I digress), he still hugs me and gives me a kiss on the head goodbye, we've even held hands going through crowded streets to stick together.\n\nI hope you don't withhold physical affection from your children if you have any; I can promise you a cuddle won't hurt.", "You\u2019re doing too much y\u2019all are so weird", "OP should buy fiance a massage or spa day to apologise.", "yeah. Autism and other mental illnesses can explain it up until about age 10, but past that age, it's something that *has* to be fixed in therapy/counseling.

The daughter could head to school tommorow and tell a friend how she \"slept with her dad last night\" and start a whole cascade of events. If there's no counselor/therapist to clear it up quickly, it could go awfully.\n\nI also think OPs way too nonchalant about this. Travelling for a night is not a huge stressor in life. If she reacts this way over this small a stressor, what in the world is gonna happen when she encounters life? I mean, it's a very short list of reasons that should make a near-adult climb in bed with their parent for comfort. We're talking being victims of violent crimes, losing close relatives, or having other life-shattering events happen. In those circumstances, it would be understandable for anyone. But, *simply travelling for a night*? how does she possibly cope with bigger stresses than this?", "This was my thinking - either daughter could join in (although three in one bed would obviously be crowded), or he could try to swap rooms for one with two beds (which I\u2019m pretty sure he said he offered to do\u2026. not sure why that wasn\u2019t the easy solution..), or daughter will have to deal with a little discomfort and some \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d (another option that comes to mind is dad taking the pull-out and allowing daughter/wife to share the bed, that way he\u2019s not putting either out)", "Exactly. I think she can choose either the pullout with dad or share the bed with the fianc\u00e9e while dad is on the couch. I just wouldn\u2019t give the option of sharing the bed with dad in this case.", "Yes, sorry, I was agreeing with you", "I agree with this. Another question I have is if this was a sensory issue or if this was a distress issue then wouldn't this have come up at the beginning of the stay, not during the last night?", "Finally a take that isn\u2019t putting this man on trial for worst father of the year. I agree with your judgement of NAH/soft YTA. \n\nI\u2019m glad his daughter felt like her father was a safe place and it sucks the fianc\u00e9 was put out, but we also don\u2019t know how autistic she is and if she could handled a different solution.\n\nHonestly the situation feels blown out of proportion and could be fixed with the agreement of booking extra beds in the future.", "The comments on here are making me lose my mind. He was doing a kind thing here for his daughter and the comments are ripping him apart.", "> Your daughter has obvious sensory issues connected to her autism \n\nThen why didn't he book a room with two beds in the first place?\n\nOr offered to sleep on the couch and let her and the fiancee share the bed?\n> it\u2019s an issue over who gets to share the bed with you.\n\nThat's a reasonable thing to take issue with. A 16 year old girl sharing a bed with her 43 year old daddy is weird.", "EXACTLYy thoughts. Automatically dismissing people experiences in the name of autism, trauma, disability, chronic illnesses, etc. Is literally the opposite to integration or acceptation.

Its parents ffs, people in comments should stop implying sexual stuff. \n\n\nI used to have horrible nightmares and night terrors (still do but not nearly as bad) when I was 16-20. I could sit and rock in my bed for hours during the night, cry and scream. I shared bed with my mom for 2 years and it helped a lot. She was waking me up when I had nightmare, held my hand, hugged me, kissed me on the head and said that everything was alright.", "Then why expect her to sleep on a couch in the first place?", "I can\u2019t sleep on those pull out beds.  No matter how I lay, that damn bar is in the middle of my back.  Always two beds!!", "I don't know anyone Autistic personally so I can't speak about  that aspect of the situation but I do know a bit about female behavior and about how a girl might feel when her Dad is about to get remarried. Perhaps she's feeling a bit insecure and looking for ways to prove to herself that she'll still be the most important female in her dad's life. With this little scenario, she certainly demonstrated to her stepmother-to-be just where she stands with her Dad and that he's willing to put her and  her needs first.", "Because she asked to sleep specifically with him which should have been cut the hell off about 8 years ago. Now this is getting a little too eerily similar to Norman Bates and codependency.

This is not preparing her for life as an adult.\n\nThis is what I couldn't comprehend. I am not autistic but I have a neurological disability which features SPD.\n\nWhen you work on sensory issues there absolutely may be sensory issues that cannot be overcome and have to be avoided BUT you also learn in OT how to properly respond to those situations and find solutions. Like if I found that I couldn't possibly sleep on a particular bed I could, make a bed somewhere else. I could ask for a cot. If the  worst case scenario happened I could say, I'm really sorry but I need help finding an appropriate solution.\n\nIt seems like all of this could have been avoided if OP had gotten his daughter appropriate help or if she was genuinely unable to make those gains in OT, why is he not making sure she's taken care of by having an appropriate bed in the first place?", "Not all Autistic folks become independent and that's okay. Maybe her future is in a group home with some level of independence, maybe it's being with her dad for the rest of his life. That's the kind of thing they're going to be figuring out now while she's a teen. That's not a failure or anything, some people have high care needs.", "For autism, it\u2019s normal, if you\u2019re special needs/have anxiety (like OP\u2019s daughter) it\u2019s pretty common.", ">Like yea she could\u2019ve sucked it up and **slept** there\n\nPerhaps. Not as painful as sensory issues but it is pretty dang common for autistic people to have sleep issues.

Queen is actually the most popular sized mattress. You'd think, \"hey, there are more sheets produced for Queen mattresses so there are more bargains.\" This is incorrect. King bedding actually goes on sale for higher discounts as do the box springs and frames. My partner actually did an undergrad project on the financial advantages of owning two kings vs. two queens for her and her roommate throughout college and found it was cheaper to purchase two king sized beds than two queens due to the bargains for king sized beds. This was strictly for purchasing new items and not thrifting, donations, etc.", "Why are you acting like parents sleeping in the bed with their children is some gross vile thing.

It's fucking creepy when people's minds go to that. \n\nI agree that a parent shouldn't be kicked out of their bed tho, but again, overall, it's not weird or bad at all for children of any age to be sleeping in the same bed as their parents. \n\nI'm 24, and I'm fine with sleeping in the same bed as my mom or literally anyone because it's SLEEPING. Hell, if I have panic attacks, I like sleeping within the same vicinity as my mom because it brings me comfort.

Coping with the world successfully as a neurodivergent person requires BOTH awareness of how much battery you have and how much each activity takes, as well as the power to make choices that limit the drain.

She was likely under a decent bit of social scrutiny, and out of her element for an extended period of time. It makes complete sense for her to be at the end of her ability to cope. And even then, she got overwhelmed and asked her dad for support, which is a pretty healthy and reasonable way to handle it. It's not like she threw a fit at dinner or something. When else are people allowed to ask for support if not in privacy with immediate family?\n\nAll these people saying she's manipulative scare me.

Second, even if you flipped the situation and said, your husband's mother, it's still very different. Allergies can and do become fatal. You can't just forget, someone could end up dead. Third, I'm not defending this situation saying this should be \"normal\", just that it is typical and not at all surprising.

The kid chose what we would have for dinner every night and when and where we would go on vacation as well as what we would do when we got there. If he didn\u2019t get his way, he\u2019d throw a tantrum until daddy gave in. Initially, my husband told me we couldn\u2019t work on being a couple until his kid grew up. I asked for family counseling. Big no. It was MISERABLE for a long time, but we made it. We all had a lot of baggage and trauma, and counseling would have helped us get through without adding more, especially for the kid, but we made it. I would ask anyone with a child who wants a healthy relationship between family members to do family counseling when you bring another person into the mix. It\u2019s especially important for the kid involved. Please don\u2019t add more trauma to step parenting situations. I have no relationship now with my husband\u2019s son, in spite of trying to show him how proud I am of him.

It\u2019s either two queens or one king, same price always. Might have been an availability issue though.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole in this case though.

You have issues", "It's possible to be uncomfortable for 2 different reasons at the same time. \n\nThose pullout couches are notoriously miserable, and being alone in a strange space is stressful if you have negative associations with that. I've never had trauma with being in a strange space and I still check that hotel doors are locked 10+ times before I feel comfortable sleeping. Heck I often check my doors at home more than once. \n\nI'm not sure how you jump straight to it being \"pure manipulation\" when there are other perfectly good explanations. I did note that the event should be considered in context with the daughter's reaction to the father's relationship as a whole. If she's constantly and intentionally getting in the way of the relationship, then there's more evidence on the side of her maybe not being entirely genuine.\n\nI just don't see how you jump straight to \"this teen who undoubtedly sleeps on her own most nights is lying to cozy up with her dad.\" What does she get out of it? A nicer bed for a night? The comfort of a person she trusts nearby? Neither of those things are insane to ask for.", "Y\u2019all are weird and have dad issues. Seek help. Not everything is sexual", "Exactly this. I  slept in the same bed with my mom when I was 17 for probably a week or so straight, I had  just lost my best friend and I just did *not* want to be alone. We've also even shared the same bed a few times when I was an adult simply due to lack of enough beds for everyone to have their own. Absolutely nothing sexual was going on and if that's where your mind goes when a child (even an older teen or adult ) comes to a parent for comfort  then that's 100% a you problem and you probably really need to sit with it for a while and try to understand why you have that visceral reaction.", "Too much hassle when you're exhausted and unpacked.

Their experience was probably anywhere from cold indifference to neglect to sexual assault. I for one was weirded out by it until I had children of my own. I never slept in the same bed as my parents or my mom when she was single. Hell, I don\u2019t even remember her ever consoling me when I had a nightmare.

That involves meeting new people and being judged on social cues, eye contact, potential physical contact, ect. That can be extremely taxing to an autistic person, and it sounds like she held it together the whole trip and didn't make any noticeable negative impression on the fiance's family. She just needed a bit of extra support at the end. Would you tell a kid in a wheelchair that they're 16 and need to get their shit together and fix their legs already? Or would you recognize they need a bit more care with certain things and encourage them to ask for the help they need? Why is it so hard for people to recognize needs that aren't accompanied with outward physical signs as valid needs?\n\nThe fiance got the nice trip to visit HER family that SHE wanted, which likely meant a lot of discomfort for the daughter. But heck the teenage girl who needs a bit of support from her dad at the end. If the fiance can't read the symptoms of autism and see why such a trip would be difficult for her soon to be step daughter, then maybe there shouldn't be a fiance any longer.", "Some people even forget allergies.
