Last night we got a hotel for the last night before we drove home, and my fianc\u00e9e and I were in the master bed and my daughter was in the pull out couch bed in the next room, and shortly after we went to sleep, my daughter asked if she could sleep in my bed with me. My daughter is on the spectrum and has anxiety from previous trauma and has some trouble with being alone in unfamiliar places, so I said absolutely and I initially offered to go sleep on the pull out couch with her but she said it was very uncomfortable and she needed to sleep on a real mattress. I asked my fianc\u00e9e if she\u2019d be willing to sleep on the pull out couch for the night, and she seemed a little annoyed. I offered to get another room for us or to figure something else out, but she insisted it was ok. So my daughter and I shared the master bed and my fianc\u00e9e slept on the pull out couch.\n\nToday we got home and she\u2019s seemed kind of passive aggressive with me and when I asked what was wrong, she said she felt completely sidelined and like she was treated with no respect or decency last night. I told her I was sorry but my daughter was in distress and I needed to do something, and she insisted she\u2019s not a little kid and could\u2019ve done something else that didn\u2019t involve sleeping in my bed with me. Then I told her she was starting to get out of line and she needs to understand I have an autistic daughter so if we\u2019re going to be together, she needs to understand stuff like this will happen from time to time. She got very annoyed with me and then walked off.\n\nAITA?\n\ntl;dr: autistic daughter was nervous sleeping in our hotel room and hated the feeling of the pull out couch so she asked to sleep in my bed with me, which put my fianc\u00e9e on the pull out couch and she feels undignified and disrespected for it.\n\nETA: something I should\u2019ve mentioned in the post is that we did talk about it and she said she\u2019d sleep on the couch. We talked about it this morning and she said she didn\u2019t want to come between us so she\u2019d sleep on the couch, but bit off more she could chew.\n\nBut in hindsight, yeah it wasn\u2019t cool of me to not get two beds.", "created_utc": 1673371393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108fcym/aita_for_asking_my_fianc\u00e9e_to_sleep_on_the_pull/", "score": 1795, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or at 16, is it equally if not more important that she begins learning how to deal with discomfort and self soothe, and comes to terms with not always getting her way? The world isn\u2019t going to cater to her limitations, nor should she be taught to expect that in every situation. Sending your fianc\u00e9 to an uncomfortable pullout to sleep alone while your daughter takes her place in bed with you is not appropriate or respectful.\n\n-Daughter takes comfortable bed and you share pull out with fiance.\n\n-You rent separate room/proper bed for daughter or at bare minimum fianc\u00e9, instead of relegating her to pullout.\n\n-You move to room with two beds so daughter has her own and you are close, but still in bed with fianc\u00e9.\n\nJust about any other option would have been better, more respectful of your fianc\u00e9 and the position she now holds in your life, and should have been ample consolation to your daughter. Completely ceding to her and giving her her way is not the answer here. Are we sure no part of this was her asserting ownership of you and intentionally pushing fianc\u00e9 to the side? If she was attempting to put a wedge between you, she succeeded. Her behavior seems borderline manipulative. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not thrilled about having to share your attention and affection with another woman. But she\u2019s going to have to learn to deal with it in a healthy and respectful manner.\n\nAutistic or not, 16 is old enough to learn healthy boundaries and make peace with not always getting one\u2019s way. You offered many compromises that should have solved the problem. Do not allow your 16 year old daughter to hold you hostage or come between you and your partner. Autism is not an excuse here. You\u2019re responsible for raising her to survive and thrive in a world that won\u2019t always be so accommodating, and you\u2019re now also responsible for respecting and considering your partner\u2019s needs and feelings, too.", "NTA. If i was in the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoes, would this situation annoy me a bit in the moment? absolutely. But in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s really not that big of a deal. It was a small inconvenience. And I personally would look at my fianc\u00e9 funny if he let his autistic daughter struggle/feel uncomfortable when she didn\u2019t have to. This is such a small sacrifice to make, and he offered to get her another room with a bed which she said no to, so i\u2019m really failing to see why ppl think he\u2019s in the wrong here (besides the \u201cout of line\u201d comment he made later to his fianc\u00e9e). If she was so bothered by couch sleeping she should\u2019ve said yes when he offered her an alternative. Ppl saying the daughter should\u2019ve slept in the bed with the fianc\u00e9e are also missing something: We don\u2019t know the nature of the relationship between the fianc\u00e9e and the daughter, and we don\u2019t know how comfortable she would\u2019ve been sleeping with the fianc\u00e9e given her history with anxiety and autism.\n\nBooking a room with multiple beds in the future is smart to prevent issues like this. You did right by your kid and anyone who feels some type of way or looks at you funny because of that can kick rocks.\n\nEdit: There were a few comments saying the dad should\u2019ve slept on the pull out with the daughter, but did you all read over the fact that this was his very first solution? We also don\u2019t know how hard he pressed his daughter about just sleeping on the couch and not waking up the fianc\u00e9e. the Y T A judgements on this one is interesting.\n\nEdit 2: People using their anecdotal experiences with autism (either having it themselves or having kids with it) You do realize that everyone\u2019s autism is different in terms of severity and whatnot?

I am on the spectrum myself so I completely sympathize with having a daughter who is autistic. It manifests in countless ways. With previous trauma and sensory issues I think it is expected there will be times when your daughter will need your attention in ways that allistic (neurotypical) people don't understand, as evidence in the comments of alluding to you being \"creepy\" for sleeping in a bed with your daughter or saying she's \"too old\" to act that way and even insinuating that she's doing it on purpose to mess with your relationship. I take offense to that on your behalf. Autism is a disability. Our brains are atypical. Even being moderately or mostly \"able\" is an enormous struggle. A father isn't \"creepy\" for letting his \\*autistic\\* daughter share a bed in the same hotel room \\*as his fiance\\*.\n\nI think you were very reasonable handling what you were dealt with in this scenario. You intended to sleep on the pullout couch first and when that was an issue, you \\*asked\\* your fiance rather than demanding she sleep on the couch, you could see she was upset and offered to get an additional room so that she was comfortable and she declined. You did right by your daughter by allowing her to feel safe and comfortable in an unfamiliar situation.\n\nAll of that being said I think you should have a bit of compassion for your fiance. Blended families are difficult to navigate. It sounds like your fiance may not fully understand what autism is and how it manifests so it must have been irritating to feel like she was kicked out of her own bed. Just the comment about your daughter's age tells me you need to have an in-depth conversation about things she should expect if you are both going to be together for a long time. Autism is one of those things that can throw a wrench in any plan that neurotypical people make at any time. Most (daresay all?) autistic people do not have additional expendable mental energy to play games with people's relationships or do things just to be unkind or be ugly. That's mostly in the wheelhouse of neurotypical people who intuit inter-personal relationships better.", "YTA - if you couldn\u2019t join your daughter on the pull out you should have went to sleep on it.

I am recently discovering I mask a lot (audhd here), and part of this is that I cite tiredness as a reason I have to leave party's early, just for example. The real reason is that it's gotten too hard to follow conversation and the loud music has made me overstimulated and my outfit isn't quite right and I'm feeling too sweaty plus 10 other things... \n\nSure, the kid did even mention that the bed wasn't so comfortable, which makes me think even less that it was manipulative, and instead just a contributing reason to feeling insecure and unsafe and uneasy in a new environment.

All people need to have ways to self soothe and it's their parents responsibility to teach them. There's no telling if she'll have her dad to comfort her in 5/10/15/etc. years.

As adults, we suck it   \nup for a night or two.\n\nJust another perspective here. As an adult, I get the choice of what is worth sucking it up for me. In consequence, I don't go very many places because a potential poor night's sleep in a hotel outweighs the value of most trips. When I do go places, I am a hawk for reviews and make sure I have good odds of being at least somewhat comfortable. Granted, I also have other health issues that make it harder to recover from that sort of thing. \n\nMy parents were of the opinion that I should just \"deal\" with all sorts of things cause I would need to as a grown up, and in consequence I had a lot of mental health issues and frequent breakdowns. Too often people expect teens to cope at adult levels without granting them adult level control. I don't see anything wrong with OP's daughter seeking her dad's support through a situation he put her in. I also think it would have been better for him to get another room for his fiance if it was financially tenable so she wasn't stuck with the pullout either. \n\nThat said, it seems like the fiance's annoyance is less with the pullout bed and more with the fact she didn't get to sleep next to OP. Let's remember she's the one who is **actually** an adult and can handle one night sleeping apart from her significant other so his daughter get the support she needs. In the future OP should involve his daughter more in the planning, so she doesn't get as overwhelmed at the moment. Just about every issue is easier to get through if you have time to prepare mentally beforehand. I have even been known to look up pictures and a general layout of my room ahead of time so I can process the space before just walking into it. \n\nI think it's a little bit presumptuous to suggest a teenager with sensory issues and past trauma is being dramatic or manipulative without significant evidence, especially when the extent of the previous trauma is not divulged. Was the daughter SAed in an unfamiliar place? That's the first form of trauma that sprang to my mind, and would 100% justify seeking out her father for comfort.\n\nYes, autistic people can be manipulative too, but her actions are easily explained as part of her condition.

Autistic children can be terrifying. (A second reminder that I, myself, was once an autistic child) what they can put their parents mindset through is a lot. A lot of the times parents take the path of no resistance and it goes well beyond just autism at that point. It verges into a form of entitlement that autistic people specifically can develop.
