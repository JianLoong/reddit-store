Then you could add on, if you can't find anyone else to make this place work, I'd be happy to join you at a different rental  if it works out to be less than $xx/day.\n\nA few years ago I found a vacation rental and then checked with friends to see if they had interest in booking it. So this was the reverse scenario of having the group and looking for a house.\n\nThe house had 5 BR including 2 master suites with King beds and attached bathrooms, a room with a queen, a room with a double, and a room with 2 twins. Those three rooms were upstairs and shared a bath. There was also a pull out couch if we really had a lot of people interested in the trip.\n\nSince I knew some of the group had more disposable income - I came up with a cost per person that was dependent on the number of people going and the relative value of the room they chose.\n\nI was fairly certain that one other person (besides me) would be willing to pay extra for the K+ BA. I was also ready to take a lesser bedroom and share a bath if someone else had wanted to pay extra for a private bath. It ended up working out well. People ended up paying different amounts but felt like they were getting some value for the extra cost. It also avoided hard feelings about the alternate scheme - i.e., someone getting a better room when everyone had paid the same.\n\nSince it was all specified in advance, people could say I'm interested but (for example) only if we are splitting it at least 4 ways and I can get one of the cheaper rooms.", "YTA, you can\u2019t afford the trip so you shouldn\u2019t be going.", "Sort of ESH - it probably would have been a good idea for you to know your vacation budget ahead of time and let all your friends know, before you all started looking for a vacation rental.
