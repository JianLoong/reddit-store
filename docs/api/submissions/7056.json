From other comments though, it sounds like OP just let everyone else do all the research and planning and he was under the impression that vacation rentals just didn't cost that much. I HATE people like that. YOU find a cheaper rental that works for everyone if it doesn't work for you. Don't expect them to do the work for you or subsidize your vacation.", "They\u2019re not the ones who are asking that someone else cover their share, so clearly they can afford the ranges they\u2019ve been looking at, whereas she can\u2019t. Did you really need me to explain that, or are you just trying to be contrary?", "Perhaps because they were looking in the price range they were confortable?\nOP says something like they finally found something they all like. I assume they were sending to each other some propositions. Normally it is at this stage you have to point your budget limit if you didn't do it before. If no one points that some propositions are too expensive, you can assume the general budget range is ok for everyone.", "Say 'that's beyond my budget of X. Either we find somewhere cheaper or I need to bow out of the trip, have fun and we'll plan something together in the future'.", "He became a full ah when he proposed they pay more than him because they have more money. It would have been different if he just said  he couldn't afford it, but here he felt entitled to their money.\n\nNon ah would have been 1. Define the max budget you can afford (it has been months and he couldn't communicate his limitations ? Is he 13?). 2. If it is over budget, a. Ask for a different location, b. Ask friend to chip in and you reimburse after (with an iou), c. Do not go and work for next vacations.", "He said they \u201cfinally found a rental we all love\u201d\n\nThis mfer was gonna pull this shit either way", "I think the main thing here is that he didn't specify his budget before they booked the trip.", "> I should have been more upfront about my budget from the beginning\n\nSays it all really, it's their own fault for not being honest.", "Probably communicate their budget clearly to their friends. The friends literally say OP should have been more upfront.\n\nWhen I was planning a trip where we were going to rent a cabin, I ensured I got everyone\u2019s max budget and search within what everyone can afford. But if they weren\u2019t honest or didn\u2019t tell me their budgets then it would have been awkward like the situation above.", "Because OP feels they should.", "Apparently OP\u2019s presence is the benefit in itself.", "Oh I agree. If they refuse to go cheaper on the location then he doesn\u2019t get to demand they pay more. He\u2019s an AH for that part. If he opted cheaper they said no it sounds like he\u2019s just not going by the sound of it.", "I see his comment now. YTA OP, and you'll be lucky if you get invited on vacation again.", "I couldn\u2019t agree more! I\u2019m the person that does all of the work for our girl\u2019s trips and also my family trips. I\u2019ve removed people from the invitation list over time because of this same damn thing. They sit back, do nothing at all, and then want to throw their two scents in at the final hour. This is after budget, location and activities have already been thoroughly discussed. Umm, no. You can plan your own vacation then.", "They aren't going to plan trips with op in the future!", "What if this is an Airbnb type reservation where the $500 \"cleaning surcharge\" and $425 \"peak holiday fee\" are not part of the original upfront pricing when they started looking? They easily could have been looking at what was a reasonable price range that escalated at check out. We don't have this info and Airbnb is notorious for their back end surcharges.", "Everyone has budgetary limitations. Jeff bezos has budgetary limitations, they're just unthinkably high. None of them agreed to a budget beforehand, why is he the AH simply for having a lower budget?", "Right? He should have said \u201cI can only afford Y, so we should look for a rental where my part is Y or less.", "It sounds like none of them agreed on a budget in the first place, wouldn't that make all of them AHs?", "I read it as that he asked to look for a cheaper rental before they booked the place. Doesn't sound like he has a problem with the trip in general, just this particular place/price range. If they *can't* get cheaper accommodations I could see your point, but it looks like they don't even want to look for anywhere else that's within OPs budget.", "But certainly going to whine about it.", "Having a budget is okay. But if OP is not able to afford it, it is best to not go instead of asking their friends to pitch in more money. It should be their friends choice/idea to take in more costs, not OP to suggest.", "Jeff Bezos does not have budgetary limitations.", "Logic and Reddit don\u2019t mix man lol.", "Not if the others didn\u2019t have budgetary constraints. If OP knew he could only afford x amount he should\u2019ve made that known from the get go. Then they could\u2019ve adjusted their search to stay within a certain amount per person.", "yse, this is just something to note for the future. OP has had a realisation of 'oh damn that's a lot more than expected' and each one of his friends assumed each one of their friends would be able to afford it. Lesson learnt for future trips, NTA", "tbh if we found somewhere nice and one person couldn't afford it i'd probably try and accommodate for them so they can still come because the trip is more important than the property i'm staying at.", "I agree with this", "Sure he does.  They're just so high you can't imagine them.\n\nElon Musk had to liquidate stocks to buy Twitter.  Rich people have to budget too, they're just budgeting for corporations and aircraft carriers while people like you and I are budgeting for shoes and beer", "Probably couldn't afford a vacation to Titan.", "Is that really the point you want to fight here? I agree, it's kinda ridiculous to say one of the richest people in the world has budget limitations, but it's kinda besides the point, is it not?", "I mean, there is a limit to his budgets. There is an amount of money outside the scope of what Jeff bezos can pay for. He and his businesses use budgets just like everyone else.", "He had to borrow money to buy Twitter, so yes, he has budget limits.", "Especially the last few days.", ">Not if the others didn\u2019t have budgetary constraints.\n\nSomehow I doubt that OP is the only one out of everyone that's going that has limits on what they're willing to spend on this trip.", "Elon had to liquidate stock to purchase Twitter because he convinced the board of directors of Tesla to agree to what is an outrageous compensation plan, in which he'd be paid in Tesla stock for the amount of cars sold. Then he hyped up the brand, made all sorts of promises, and not only failed to deliver on various promises, but also allowed Tesla quality control to become even more atrocious to ensure more units would be sold.\n\nOtherwise, yeah, there are budgetary restrictions in place for any and all persons, governments, or corporations.", "Its beside the point, but the man's budget for, I dunno, space travel? Is not unlimited. Everyone budgets, everyone has an upper limit. \n\nThe point was, all of OPs friends are included in the everyone who has an upper limit.", "You can\u2019t be serious.", "Of course everyone has a budget. But if OP knew for sure that they couldn\u2019t go or planned to pass the extra expense onto the others if it went over a certain amount he should\u2019ve brought that up first thing.", "Look the point is that everyone has some kind of budget, even if youre rich you still have a limit on what you want to spend on a vacation.", "Yes, he is an asshole for trying to get the others to cover him.\n\nBut I still don't agree that OP is the only one to blame for no one discussing their budget beforehand.", "How exactly did OP not know beforehand how much it was going to cost? Most places very plainly list rhe cost, and one could assume, that cost would need to be split 3 ways or whatever. Seems like OP knew about thw cost beforehand but was hoping their friends could front the amount that they couldn't pay on their own.", "Fair enough"]}
