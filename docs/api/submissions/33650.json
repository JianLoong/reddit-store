Christmas is in two days).  This way it ensures the money is actually being spent on the children.  I would also tell her there will be no more money.  Borrowing or for her to get her own kids presents.  She has all year to save up her own funds.  If she balks at you buying the gifts instead of giving her cash, you can tell this is her only choice.", "YTA for not giving her warning you weren't planning on giving her the money you usually do.\n\nYou haven't even asked her to pay back the earlier loan, it sounds like you had resigned yourself to not getting that money back regardless. You literally say you didn't think about it until she called.\n\nThis feels like you're punishing her. If you dont' want to give her money any more fine, but waiting until the last minute???
