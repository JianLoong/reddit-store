The kids are provided for. She just can't take credit for giving them some of their gifts. She wasn't the one getting them the gifts anyway, you were.  A $1,400 gift of forgiving a loan is very generous. If she ever considered paying you back then she'd recognize this. But since she was going to just keep the money and stiff you, it doesn't feel like a gift to her.  It would have been nice to tell her earlier, but you told her when you thought of it. Had you told her earlier, maybe she could have found some extra work to pay for the gifts. But the money from that should have gone to you anyway.  I hope she gets her act together. She's disappointed and stressed and looking to place blame. But it's not your fault.", "NTA, your sister knew she owed you the $1400 and she knew Christmas was coming. At what point in her life was she going to stop asking you for the money? She didn\u2019t tell you she wasn\u2019t going to paying you back so you didn\u2019t owe her any advanced notice either.", "NTA\n\nIt's not the $300 that is the issue, it is that she never paid you back the $1400 loan.\n\nNever lend money to friends or family. It will always end in tears!", "NTA\n\nI suspect your sister doesn\u2019t spend all $300 on her kids.", "NTA\n\nI grew up with that kind of mother. You're doing the right thing.", "NTA. Your sister needs to get her life in order. If needed for piece of mind buy some extra gifts for the kids and slap your sister name on the tag so the kids will not be collateral damage.", "Nta, but stop giving your sister money period. She no longer see\u2019s it as gifts or loans but entitlement to your money.", "NTA. And congrats on evolving beyond being an ATM.", "NTA you're not an ATM you're a brother. She loaned money with the promise she'd pay you back. Didn't. Now has come back for more money?\n\nMaybe as a gesture you could give her the money saying this is the last time i will not be doing it again. But you are under no obligation to.", "NTA\n\nYour sister's angry reaction doesn't make sense.  Disappointment would make sense, but screaming at you is outrageous.  Are you sure that you sister was spending all $300 on the kids?  Her reaction makes more sense if your sister has an addiction or spending issue and was planning to spend some of your money on something you wouldn't approve of.", "**You basically GIFTED her 1400$ and she can't even say thank you?**\n\nFine, tell her you'll take THAT gift back, that you'll gift her 300$ and that you'll contact Small Claims Court to get the long overdue 1400$ back.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She\u2019s taken advantage of your kindness long enough.", "NTA\nSounds like you need to step up and stop being an ATM. She\u2019s a leech. And her kids need her to stop being a terrible excuse for an adult and actually earn her keep. Show them how to get along in life. Not by being the best beggar on the family corner either. Don\u2019t give her money next year and make sure she knows this now.", "Nta", "Stop giving her money", "NTA.", "Her asshole reaction to not getting your money shows exactly what she is: ungrateful and entitled.\n\nYou were overly generous in forgiving that debt; that she didn't thank you for it means she had zero plans for paying you back.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  She should have paid her debt when she promised to.  You are giving her $1400.  Tell her now to make plans for next year because you won't be subsidizing her life any more.  Remind your parents that the kids will be fine with gifts from everyone.  Your sister should be able to afford dollar store gifts for less than $300.  Five below is great for low cost gifts.  Your sis is still making lousy choices, she hasn't learned any lessons from the past.", "NTA. Your sister is. I\u2019d rethink ever giving her money again", "Stop enabling your sister.  What fraction do you really think goes to the children versus fuels her continuing poor choices?", "You're NTA here. What sucks is that your sister isn't seeing the debt forgiven as a gift. Which means she never viewed the money in the first place as a loan, but as a gift. \n\nYou seem very at peace with this financial dynamic with your sister but you COULD consider offering her a choice here. She can have the $300 now for holiday gifts but she also must sign a loan repayment plan and have it notarized (or made binding somehow) to structure how she will repay the $1400 loan. Once proposing this, your sister might actually appreciate that they money you LOANED her being forgiven is a much more significant gift.", "OP make sure the gifts you give are clearly marked as being from you.

I wanted to keep the peace and not give any reason to blame me to ANYONE so I ended up saying \u201cok, I\u2019ll give you the normal money as your gift this year, but your gift next year is that I\u2019m cancelling that debt, so you know now, a year in advance, plan accordingly, and I truely hope you understand cancelling the debt is a much much bigger gift than the money I normally\nGive you for gifts (my way of making clear they should have paid me back).\n\nIf you\u2019re really concerned, maybe try the same approach, but either way, NTA.", "NTA \n\nLooks like someone needs a refresher lesson on the Golden Rule. \n\nThe People With The Gold Make The Rules.", "NTA, you may have wanted to give her more of a heads up about not getting the money this year though.", "[deleted]", "The timing was very poor. NTA for the move, but probably a bit of an AH for the timing.", "NTA\u2026but think of the children. (I do agree this should have been mentioned earlier if this has been your normal for a few years).  .  If you can afford it, I would not give the money to your sister directly.  Tell her to give you a list of what she would like to get and you will get what you can for her.  Or go shopping with her.  (Although, isn\u2019t it really late in the game for her to be asking?  Christmas is in two days).  This way it ensures the money is actually being spent on the children.  I would also tell her there will be no more money.  Borrowing or for her to get her own kids presents.  She has all year to save up her own funds.  If she balks at you buying the gifts instead of giving her cash, you can tell this is her only choice.", "YTA for not giving her warning you weren't planning on giving her the money you usually do.\n\nYou haven't even asked her to pay back the earlier loan, it sounds like you had resigned yourself to not getting that money back regardless. You literally say you didn't think about it until she called.\n\nThis feels like you're punishing her. If you dont' want to give her money any more fine, but waiting until the last minute??? The money would make a huge difference to her, it's something she counts on every year and you didn't even think about it before saying no.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
