Terry can still be very difficult to look after. He will experience meltdowns if something makes him uncomfortable (such as a food texture he does not like) or will throw fits if he cannot have his way. Terry has broken holes in the walls during his meltdowns/fits and I am honestly afraid of him whenever he becomes destructive that way because he is larger/stronger than me.\n\nI had been parentified by the time I was about thirteen because my parents expected me to handle Terry\u2019s needs whenever they were busy or needed a break (which was often.) I have been upfront with my parents that I still hold resentment towards them because of this, and that Terry should not have been my responsibility to the extent they made him. My parents insist their parenting was perfect and are unwilling to alter their viewpoint. I have told them that I am not going to be Terry\u2019s caregiver and to not leave him with me.\n\nUnfortunately, my parents know where I live. Recently, my parents have begun ringing my doorbell, telling me to watch Terry, and then leaving before I can say anything back. Then I\u2019d have to cancel my plans and wait on the porch with Terry until they came back. When they came back, I told them all four times to stop doing this, but was ignored every time. I was forced to call out of work for the most recent \u201cdrop-off\u201d incident. I lost my temper with my mother when she came to pick Terry up and told her that if she or my father try to leave Terry with me even one more time, I will call Adult Protective Services and report Terry as abandoned.\n\nA few days later, my mother again dropped Terry off on my porch and took off. So I followed through with my word and called to report Terry as an abandoned disabled adult. I waited with him on the porch until a social worker came. My parents exploded on me, calling me a horrible daughter and sister. They said they were barely able to get Terry back and accused me of only caring about myself and wanting Terry to be neglected in a public group home. I snapped at them that Terry would probably be better off in a public group home because they\u2019re the ones neglecting him for their own convenience. And that I\u2019m not going to keep putting my life on pause for their own personal comfort anymore.\n\nNow people (mostly friends of my parents) who I barely even knew or remembered before, are bombarding me with messages calling me selfish. A few have approached me in public to tell me that I don\u2019t give a shit about my brother and I\u2019m ungrateful for all the sacrifices that my parents made for me and Terry. I\u2019ve already changed my phone number. But it\u2019s getting so bad that I am considering applying for a job transfer and moving.

I am an in-home caregiver for two young adults with severe autism.

They clearly need to hire a caregiver themselves whether that\u2019s someone they pay for out of pocket a few times a week, or someone who can work full-time through his state benefits. You are in NO way selfish and anyone who calls you that should be kicked out of your life.

Who knows what version of the story your parents are telling these people.", "I'm so happy for you and impressed that you developed a healthy sense of self and know what you are required to do and what you are entitled to as a human being. Watching your brother is a full-time job and the fact that your parents assume you can do it whenever they drop him off is so disrespectful. \n\nHere's my advice. Move. And don't let them know where you live. And pray for Terry if you pray, or visit Terry if he winds up in a home, and give what you can to him. And I commiserate with your early adulthood. For very different reasons I was also needing to be grown very young. It sucks. Your boundaries are reasonable. It is a sad situation. They are handling it, in their desperation, like monsters.

I would have done the same", "NTA.\n\nYour parents wouldn't respect your boundaries,  They will now.\n\nYour parents wouldn't take proper care and arrange for proper respite care for Terry.

The screenshot the message so you have proof later. If they accost you in public, immediately ask them for $1,000 so you can create a respite care fund so Terry can get qualified safe care when your parents need a break.

Terry is not your responsibility, and them dropping him off at random could really hurt you financially and physically from what you said. The best probably would be putting him into a shared him as the only one who seems to truly care about him is you, and while you are unable to constantly care for him whether it be personal or not is irrelevant to the fact that you don\u2019t NEED to. I believe your idea of a job transfer and change of location would be best.", "NTA - Block the noise. You called because they were aholes dropping him off.

I'm really sorry that your parents don't see you as their child, but as a built-in carer for Terry. \n\nThe truth is that your parents are never going to protect you. They're never going to put you above Terry. You *must* protect yourself from your parents and their behaviour. Terry is *not your responsibility*. Anyone who tries to tell you that you are a bad person for refusing to give into your parents' entitlement is an AH. Your parents have to figure out how to manage Terry's care, and managing his care by dumping him at your door does *not* count. They deserve to have APS called on them because they are *neglecting* your brother.\n\nFor the future, because it will certainly only get worse as your parents get older, if your parents name you as Terry's carer you do *not* have to accept.

You are an adult with your own life and cannot be expected to assume your parent's responsibilities or defer & ignore meeting your own responsibilities to compensate for their neglect. You did the correct thing by notifying adult protective services.

It\u2019s awful that your parents have done this to you.  If they need assistance/reprieve from Terry then they need to put services in place to help them (adult day care, group home, in home care).  They can\u2019t just dump him on your doorstep and run. That is the actual definition of abandonment. \n\nYou warned them. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Those aps investigators can tell them about it too. There is often a waiting list. Even living at home he will likely be eligible for respite services (babysitting) in home often for a minimum of 40-60 hrs per week. He may also be eligible for day programs, or camps. Those services will also follow him to allow him placement when your parents are no longer able to care for him. \n\nPersonally, I am a huge supporter of placing a dependent disabled adult in a group home before parents/family are completely unable to assist, because it means the transition is easier, a good home can be selected, he can come home for weekends or summer visits, and the parents are still involved to make sure his services are top notch. \n\nBased on what you listed here, in my state, he would likely be eligible for 1:2 services, so instead of a group home he would have a single house mate in a two bedroom apartment or home with his own 1:1 caregiver part of the day and a shared caregiver overnight and some day hours. While your parents make it feel like a horrible, evil thing, it\u2019s actually normal for a person to grow up and move out and with the commitment to find a good company and good services, many individuals flourish living on their own. \n\nSource: Behavior specialist working with individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities for over a decade, and I specialize in working with individuals with behavioral issues", "R/entitledparents or something like that.
