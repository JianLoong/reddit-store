Terry can still be very difficult to look after. He will experience meltdowns if something makes him uncomfortable (such as a food texture he does not like) or will throw fits if he cannot have his way. Terry has broken holes in the walls during his meltdowns/fits and I am honestly afraid of him whenever he becomes destructive that way because he is larger/stronger than me.\n\nI had been parentified by the time I was about thirteen because my parents expected me to handle Terry\u2019s needs whenever they were busy or needed a break (which was often.) I have been upfront with my parents that I still hold resentment towards them because of this, and that Terry should not have been my responsibility to the extent they made him. My parents insist their parenting was perfect and are unwilling to alter their viewpoint. I have told them that I am not going to be Terry\u2019s caregiver and to not leave him with me.\n\nUnfortunately, my parents know where I live. Recently, my parents have begun ringing my doorbell, telling me to watch Terry, and then leaving before I can say anything back. Then I\u2019d have to cancel my plans and wait on the porch with Terry until they came back. When they came back, I told them all four times to stop doing this, but was ignored every time. I was forced to call out of work for the most recent \u201cdrop-off\u201d incident. I lost my temper with my mother when she came to pick Terry up and told her that if she or my father try to leave Terry with me even one more time, I will call Adult Protective Services and report Terry as abandoned.\n\nA few days later, my mother again dropped Terry off on my porch and took off. So I followed through with my word and called to report Terry as an abandoned disabled adult. I waited with him on the porch until a social worker came. My parents exploded on me, calling me a horrible daughter and sister. They said they were barely able to get Terry back and accused me of only caring about myself and wanting Terry to be neglected in a public group home. I snapped at them that Terry would probably be better off in a public group home because they\u2019re the ones neglecting him for their own convenience. And that I\u2019m not going to keep putting my life on pause for their own personal comfort anymore.\n\nNow people (mostly friends of my parents) who I barely even knew or remembered before, are bombarding me with messages calling me selfish. A few have approached me in public to tell me that I don\u2019t give a shit about my brother and I\u2019m ungrateful for all the sacrifices that my parents made for me and Terry. I\u2019ve already changed my phone number. But it\u2019s getting so bad that I am considering applying for a job transfer and moving.

I am an in-home caregiver for two young adults with severe autism.

They clearly need to hire a caregiver themselves whether that\u2019s someone they pay for out of pocket a few times a week, or someone who can work full-time through his state benefits.

Who knows what version of the story your parents are telling these people.", "I'm so happy for you and impressed that you developed a healthy sense of self and know what you are required to do and what you are entitled to as a human being. Watching your brother is a full-time job and the fact that your parents assume you can do it whenever they drop him off is so disrespectful. \n\nHere's my advice. Move. And don't let them know where you live. And pray for Terry if you pray, or visit Terry if he winds up in a home, and give what you can to him. And I commiserate with your early adulthood. For very different reasons I was also needing to be grown very young. It sucks. Your boundaries are reasonable. It is a sad situation. They are handling it, in their desperation, like monsters.

I would have done the same", "NTA.\n\nYour parents wouldn't respect your boundaries,  They will now.\n\nYour parents wouldn't take proper care and arrange for proper respite care for Terry.

The screenshot the message so you have proof later. If they accost you in public, immediately ask them for $1,000 so you can create a respite care fund so Terry can get qualified safe care when your parents need a break.

Terry is not your responsibility, and them dropping him off at random could really hurt you financially and physically from what you said.

They're never going to put you above Terry. You *must* protect yourself from your parents and their behaviour. Terry is *not your responsibility*. Anyone who tries to tell you that you are a bad person for refusing to give into your parents' entitlement is an AH.

They deserve to have APS called on them because they are *neglecting* your brother.\n\nFor the future, because it will certainly only get worse as your parents get older, if your parents name you as Terry's carer you do *not* have to accept.

You are an adult with your own life and cannot be expected to assume your parent's responsibilities or defer & ignore meeting your own responsibilities to compensate for their neglect.

They can\u2019t just dump him on your doorstep and run. That is the actual definition of abandonment. \n\nYou warned them. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Those services will also follow him to allow him placement when your parents are no longer able to care for him. \n\nPersonally, I am a huge supporter of placing a dependent disabled adult in a group home before parents/family are completely unable to assist, because it means the transition is easier, a good home can be selected, he can come home for weekends or summer visits, and the parents are still involved to make sure his services are top notch. \n\nBased on what you listed here, in my state, he would likely be eligible for 1:2 services, so instead of a group home he would have a single house mate in a two bedroom apartment or home with his own 1:1 caregiver part of the day and a shared caregiver overnight and some day hours. While your parents make it feel like a horrible, evil thing, it\u2019s actually normal for a person to grow up and move out and with the commitment to find a good company and good services, many individuals flourish living on their own. \n\nSource: Behavior specialist working with individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities for over a decade, and I specialize in working with individuals with behavioral issues", "R/entitledparents or something like that.

You are afraid of your brother, who can sometimes be very destructive. All those people bothering you have no intent to actually assist with Terry's care, so screw them. Lock down your social media, no tagging you or leaving posts without approval.  You shouldn't have to move away, but it probably is not the worst idea.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA It. Looks to me like your parents have weaponised your brother to get you to tow the line. I am a father of a disabled son, who, through no fault of his own makes life very difficult at times especially for his brother and sisters. So I understand your reluctance to be his carer even just for a short period. It requires patience and constant supervision which is way more than should be asked of their child. \n\nTo put it bluntly, my kids didn't ask for another brother. That was on my wife and I and it takes two of us alternating his care to make it work. That's before we ask a child to fetch something or go to another room because he's in meltdown. The same applies to you as you never had a choice in having a sibling so the onus is on them to provide for his care, not you.\n\nFor them to drop him off that way, tells me you did the right thing. Everyone siding with your mom clearly doesn't understand or really care about 'you' so they don't matter. Your mom though sounds like a horrible piece of work for how she's dealt with the issue from start till this point. Best wishes OP.", "NTA.  You told them what would happen.", "NTA", "Both your parents are the biggest assholes ever! Shame on both of them expecting and assuming you\u2019ll always tend to Terry despite telling them to stop. Best thing you did calling Adult Protective Service your parents are negligent. Best to go no contact with both parents they have no respect for you as a human being.", "Definitely NTA. In fact, you should keep calling in to APS to make sure they are monitoring your brother's care because what they are doing is alarming. As an autistic person, what they are doing enrages me. \n\nI'd move if I were you and had the ability. Move far. \n\nI completely understand that caring for a disabled person is a lot, and it's very stressful. But they need to locate the resources available to help with that, and then be responsible in overseeing the additional care so there isn't abuse (or more abuse; they don't sound like very kind people).", "NTA. Definitely if you can move, do so. And those asshat friends of your parents can watch him.", "I would argue they don't care about their son, either", "Just to be clear, they are not favouring the son - they are favouring themselves. It's a lot cheaper and easier to force the care of their son onto their daughter than to source out a good care home/professional carers, and help their son with that transition. He is *not* safe staying with OP - if she is worried that he might accidentally injure her, he probably needs a second carer present. This is a dangerous and unsustainable situation for everyone involved", "And who would be responsible for OP'S injuries? I sincerely doubt \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f good ole mom and pop!", "I can't say that idea sits comfortably with me, in vast majority of circumstances that would definitely be medical abuse. Extreme measures like that should only be considered on a case-by-case basis, in situations where every other reasonable solution has been tried already. Like if the child is persistently violent, both behaviour therapy and drugs have failed to make a dent, and there's solid reason to believe that going through puberty would negatively affect the child's quality of life. Otherwise, you are effectively opening the door for eugenics.", "The case in question was a severely physically and mentally disabled child who could never live without 24 hour care, and who was not capable of having or expressing desire beyond the very basic infant level needs.  \n\nHonestly I think it is cruel to put someone with that level of mental function to puberty, especially someone biologically female when menstruation can be agonizing and not being able to communicate could be torture if she has endometriosis or PCOS which can make them worse, as well as cause anemia in cases of heavy sustained bleeding, especially if they are being kept alive with a feeding tube. \n\nI don't consider it eugenics in cases where the person cannot realistically consent to sex let alone be capable of caring for a child in any capacity.", "NTA. Dropping their son off unannounced with someone that can't really control him is abuse, add in that they are doing it to their daughter is doubly abusive. Those people that you barely knew or remembered are unimportant. Show them how unimportant they are by telling them that if they are so concerned that THEY should volunteer their time to watch him, if they are unwilling, they can go FTS.", "NTA by any stretch of the imagination. For anyone telling you that you need to be more supportive, tell them you\u2019ll care for Terry as often as they do. I can guarantee no one will actually take you up on that. \n\nWould it be the worst thing in the world to relocate? It sounds like it\u2019s your best option.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, if your parents were unable or unwilliing to care for a child with physical or mental disabilities, they should have given him up for adoption or foster care after he was born.\n\nHave these friends of your parents ever baby sat Terry to give your folks a break?", "ESH. Your resentment is overwhelming.\nFamilies look after other members, and now you\u2019re and adult you still can\u2019t give your mom and Dad a break!\n\nSome people absolutely physically can\u2019t abide looking after others and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not helpful, but it\u2019s no different from the absolute opposite of loving looking after others.\n\nIt must be so hard for you parents, and obviously that seems to have morphed in a neglect of your needs. Which wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t fair on you.\n\nYou all should have dealt with this years ago.", "We\u2019ve tried that avenue with every group home that takes our insurance and/or Medicaid Waiver. The reason they wouldn\u2019t take her is the main reason we need their help. She\u2019s too violent and they can\u2019t put the other patrons at risk of being hurt or worse. She went to a day program for three months and got discharged after a couple of stunts. I understand that the staff is trained for this kind of thing, but a defenseless person is a wheelchair is not.", "It's so kind of you to help him out!! He's lucky to have you.", "Fabulous response.", "you talk. you fight you argue and you make it better. But you do it inside your family. Theres no need to REPORT YOUR BROTHER AS AN ABANDONED PERSON WHEN HE IS NOT. You people really cant think straight. How can you defend this??? its crazy that you people think the solution is to report your OWN BROTHER to services without knowing exactly where will he end. Its beyond crazy. People here think of their brother as a burden or as an object that you simply dispose or throw away. The only thing that I can think of is that different cultures feel the concept of family different.", "Your bar for caring is sadly low.", "You don\u2019t know what the services are in any given jurisdiction, my brother in Christ."]}
