Terry can still be very difficult to look after. He will experience meltdowns if something makes him uncomfortable (such as a food texture he does not like) or will throw fits if he cannot have his way. Terry has broken holes in the walls during his meltdowns/fits and I am honestly afraid of him whenever he becomes destructive that way because he is larger/stronger than me.\n\nI had been parentified by the time I was about thirteen because my parents expected me to handle Terry\u2019s needs whenever they were busy or needed a break (which was often.) I have been upfront with my parents that I still hold resentment towards them because of this, and that Terry should not have been my responsibility to the extent they made him. My parents insist their parenting was perfect and are unwilling to alter their viewpoint. I have told them that I am not going to be Terry\u2019s caregiver and to not leave him with me.\n\nUnfortunately, my parents know where I live. Recently, my parents have begun ringing my doorbell, telling me to watch Terry, and then leaving before I can say anything back. Then I\u2019d have to cancel my plans and wait on the porch with Terry until they came back. When they came back, I told them all four times to stop doing this, but was ignored every time. I was forced to call out of work for the most recent \u201cdrop-off\u201d incident. I lost my temper with my mother when she came to pick Terry up and told her that if she or my father try to leave Terry with me even one more time, I will call Adult Protective Services and report Terry as abandoned.\n\nA few days later, my mother again dropped Terry off on my porch and took off. So I followed through with my word and called to report Terry as an abandoned disabled adult. I waited with him on the porch until a social worker came. My parents exploded on me, calling me a horrible daughter and sister. They said they were barely able to get Terry back and accused me of only caring about myself and wanting Terry to be neglected in a public group home. I snapped at them that Terry would probably be better off in a public group home because they\u2019re the ones neglecting him for their own convenience. And that I\u2019m not going to keep putting my life on pause for their own personal comfort anymore.\n\nNow people (mostly friends of my parents) who I barely even knew or remembered before, are bombarding me with messages calling me selfish. A few have approached me in public to tell me that I don\u2019t give a shit about my brother and I\u2019m ungrateful for all the sacrifices that my parents made for me and Terry. I\u2019ve already changed my phone number. But it\u2019s getting so bad that I am considering applying for a job transfer and moving.

I am an in-home caregiver for two young adults with severe autism. It\u2019s 100% unfair for them to have put that responsibility on you as a child and to continue their actions by randomly showing up on your doorstep as an adult. They clearly need to hire a caregiver themselves whether that\u2019s someone they pay for out of pocket a few times a week, or someone who can work full-time through his state benefits. You are in NO way selfish and anyone who calls you that should be kicked out of your life. I can barely do what I do (I have been hit and hurt multiple times during meltdowns) and I have actual training and experience for it.", "100% NTA. Dropping your disabled brother off on your porch and running off after ringing the doorbell is rediculous. What if you aren't home or can't come to the door?

Who knows what version of the story your parents are telling these people.", "I'm so happy for you and impressed that you developed a healthy sense of self and know what you are required to do and what you are entitled to as a human being. Watching your brother is a full-time job and the fact that your parents assume you can do it whenever they drop him off is so disrespectful. \n\nHere's my advice. Move. And don't let them know where you live. And pray for Terry if you pray, or visit Terry if he winds up in a home, and give what you can to him. And I commiserate with your early adulthood. For very different reasons I was also needing to be grown very young. It sucks. Your boundaries are reasonable. It is a sad situation. They are handling it, in their desperation, like monsters. NTA", "NTA. I would have done the same", "NTA.\n\nYour parents wouldn't respect your boundaries,  They will now.\n\nYour parents wouldn't take proper care and arrange for proper respite care for Terry. They will now.\n\nAs for the peanut gallery, reply to every message that they are never to contact you again and if they do you will call the police for stalking. The screenshot the message so you have proof later. If they accost you in public, immediately ask them for $1,000 so you can create a respite care fund so Terry can get qualified safe care when your parents need a break. When they refuse, tell them then they need to shut the hell up about how your family takes care of your dangerous and unstable brother and never speak to you again until they pony up for his care.", "NTA\n\nThe next time you move, it'd probably be best not to share your address with your family, as unfortunate as that is. \n\nYour parents (and anyone else coming out of the woodwork to support this nonsense) all sounds like excellent candidates to go no contact with.", "Easy NTA. Terry is not your responsibility, and them dropping him off at random could really hurt you financially and physically from what you said. The best probably would be putting him into a shared him as the only one who seems to truly care about him is you, and while you are unable to constantly care for him whether it be personal or not is irrelevant to the fact that you don\u2019t NEED to. I believe your idea of a job transfer and change of location would be best.", "NTA - Block the noise. You called because they were aholes dropping him off. After changing your phone number change anything else that will elevate your life. His care is not your responsibility. They abused you both with the drop off antics.

I'm really sorry that your parents don't see you as their child, but as a built-in carer for Terry. \n\nThe truth is that your parents are never going to protect you. They're never going to put you above Terry. You *must* protect yourself from your parents and their behaviour. Terry is *not your responsibility*. Anyone who tries to tell you that you are a bad person for refusing to give into your parents' entitlement is an AH. Your parents have to figure out how to manage Terry's care, and managing his care by dumping him at your door does *not* count. They deserve to have APS called on them because they are *neglecting* your brother.\n\nFor the future, because it will certainly only get worse as your parents get older, if your parents name you as Terry's carer you do *not* have to accept. They can not force you, while they are alive or after they die, to become Terry's carer.", "NTA, your parents seems to be toxic", "NTA.

Move and let your parents arrange professional help for their child.", "Nta-  he isn't your son. And your mom is probably going around telling people how awful you are and spicing it up in her favor. Stick with it. You are NTA.", "NTA. Your parents are throwing all the responsibility onto you and expect you to comply simply because you're family. You warned them and followed through. Your parents expect you to be 'grateful' simply because they raised you and expect you to do whatever they say. I suggest getting rid of the toxicity out of your life and cutting contact.", "NTA OP, your brother will benefit from specialized care. You are an adult with your own life and cannot be expected to assume your parent's responsibilities or defer & ignore meeting your own responsibilities to compensate for their neglect. You did the correct thing by notifying adult protective services. You are correct that a group home with trained habilitation specialists and a peer group may be in the best interests of your brother's happiness. My developmentally disabled niece enjoyed the education, social life, friends and supportive work environment she experienced in her group home. It is indeed a good option.", "NTA", "You are NTA.

If and when you do relocate I would not give anyone your new contact information unless they are someone who you trust completely to not give the informationt to your parents.

You are totally not the AH,  your parents are.   They did abandon him.   You are not capable of caring for him and told them that.   They are the selfish ones just dumping him on you when you have to work.   You 100% did the right thing.\n\nSounds like your parents are sending a bunch of flying monkeys your way,  I hope you can block those people.   Or tell them they can \"babysit\" next time.", "NTA. But it sounds like your parents are going off their rocker & need some help. That social worker should work with them about some in home care so they can have some breaks.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s so uncaring of your parents to drop him off on your porch and just expect you to take care of him. How do they even know that you\u2019re home? \n\nFor example, even if your car is in a driveway, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re home, because what if you went somewhere with a friend in his/her car. \n\nVery sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA\n\nYou have been forced to take on more responsibility than someone you should.   It\u2019s awful that your parents have done this to you.  If they need assistance/reprieve from Terry then they need to put services in place to help them (adult day care, group home, in home care).  They can\u2019t just dump him on your doorstep and run. That is the actual definition of abandonment. \n\nYou warned them. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  Hopefully they won\u2019t do it again. And hopefully being connected with protective services will help them in the long run.", "NTA. Good for you for reporting your parents! This internet stranger is very proud of you! Keep reporting them as necessary! And if you have to transfer, so be it.", "NTA. What your parents are doing is totally unreasonable, you\u2019ve told them multiple times not to do it and they\u2019ve had fair warning of what would happen. Making you call out off work could impact your employment. I do feel sorry for your brother, it\u2019s not his fault but equally it\u2019s not your problem. They need to arrange some sort of respite care or in home care or consider putting him into a facility where he may actually be happier to be honest.", "NTA sounds like a majority of the sacrifices your parents made for Terry were at your expense. You already pointed out how unsafe his meltdowns are for you and they could be putting your job and livelihood at risk. I would argue you did right by Terry. Group Home doesn't automatically=neglect. He'd probably be better off there than with people who treat him like a hamster you can just ask someone to feed for a day or two.", "NTA.  Do the transfer and move if you can and want to.
