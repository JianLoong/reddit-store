She has beautiful natural red hair, and has been growing it for about 5-6 years.  My parents have not allowed her to cut or dye her hair as they don\u2019t want her to ruin her natural beauty.  I will preface this is not a family tradition or religious thing, they just like her natural hair.  For her 16th birthday she decided to cut it from the middle of her butt to about her shoulder blades.  My step dad\u2019s daughter (whom I am not close with nor claim as my sibling.  We\u2019ll call her Ashley) was supposed to show up with her husband and 2 kids with a specially prepared birthday cake.  Ashley has been decorating detailed specialized cakes for about 10 years now.  She committed to bringing to cake as well as going to go get dinner, but canceled last minute because it \u201cDidn\u2019t fit in her schedule.\u201d  This hurt my sister\u2019s feelings, so I went and bought Bundt Cakes for her with birthday candles to cheer her up.  Ashley sent her mother to our house to deliver the cake while we were out.  After we finished eating my other sister (19) had made a post with a picture of my sister on her Facebook wishing her a Happy Birthday.  Ashley made a comment on the post stating \u201cHappy Birthday, I love you, but you\u2019ll regret cutting your hair.  Your parents are ridiculous for letting you do something so stupid.\u201d  \nIn my eyes this comment was completely uncalled for and rude to say to a teen on her birthday.  There should never be a \u201cbut\u201d after \u201cI love you\u201d.  We left the restaurant and on the way home I responded to this mean girl hate comment saying \u201cKeep your negative, rude comments of my sister\u2019s appearance to your damn self instead of commenting them on Facebook.  Say Happy Birthday and move the fuck on.\u201d  When we got home I tried tell my mom about what I had said in response to her comment and Stepdad interjected, loudly disagreeing with my involvement in the problem and telling me that it\u2019s \u201cNot my place to say anything.\u201d  I responded that \u201cAs her big brother it is my place to defend her from anyone in or out of this family from disrespecting her and commenting on her appearance.\u201d  I later received a message from Ashley saying \u201cOur relationship is completely over, until you apologize so fuck you. You do not disrespect me, (sister\u2019s name spelt incorrectly) is old enough to call me and say that hurt her feelings. You just have really big Facebook balls.  Peace Out!\u201d\nI had no way of responding to the message as she blocked me from responding.  \n\nSo, am I the asshole for defending my teenage sister from a grown woman leaving a rude comment of her appearance?\n\nI feel personally that no matter who says anything rude about my sister I\u2019m going to stand up for her and speak my mind.

Stepdad usually ruins every family event with attitude including holidays and birthdays, so any bit if arguing caused could hurt her.  I thought about that after the fact, but I also feel that she knows I was just defending her.  The post was deleted before any of her friends or any other family members could view it, so the likelihood of embarrassment is low, more so just disappointment that there\u2019s another argument during a celebration.", "NTA\n\nShe is a grown woman who decided to bully a minor on her birthday.", "NTA.\n\n\nI was a super pale natural blonde until my late 30s.\n\nMy parents threatened me with disownment if I ever dared to do anything to my hair.

Sorry I know it's not a big part of the story. \n\nI couldn't quite get over that your parents wouldn't \"let\" your sister cut her own hair until she was 16. That seems a bit overboard. It's a pity that Ashley focused on her idea that your sister was making a mistake rather than on the fact that your sister was, as she should be, asserting her control over her own hair, which is something your sister should have been allowed to do years before.\n\nIt seems a bit inconsistent for Ashley to say something so disrespectful and unkind, on a public forum, about your sister on your sister's birthday, and then turn around and demand an apology from you because you criticized her.. on the same public forum. \n\nYou are NTA.

Gotta love a hypocrite.", "NTA - Sticking up for your teenage sister who is being attacked by an adult is the action of a hero. Well done. You behaved like my older brother, who was always willing and able to stick up for his younger siblings (all 6 of them).

Especially hair?", "NTA, and good for you for standing up for your sister. \n\nI chopped my \u201cnever cut your beautiful\u201d hair at 16 and never looked back. Bobbed to my chin, and then a pixie shortly after. Never regretted it once, and really resented how people seemed to think they owned my appearance because I had nice long hair. They were fucking rude, and they were fucking wrong. \n\nAnd as everyone knows, you can always discard the part of a sentence that comes before the \u201cbut\u201d (I\u2019m not racist, *but*\u2026 [all the racism]).

On top of that I\u2019m grown and don\u2019t need anyone telling me what I can and can\u2019t do when it comes to freely speaking my mind.  Sister is not biologically related to us and is stepdad\u2019s adopted daughter.  We\u2019ve been in her life since she was a baby though, so she is my sister but my stepdad is indeed who she would consider her father and my mom is who she considers her mother.  She may to some extent consider stepdad\u2019s daughter her sister, but I do not as she was not present in neither me nor my siblings lives enough to earn that title.  It was more of a sibling matter of me telling off Ashley to not comment on sister\u2019s appearance on a public forum.", "I meant more \u201cwhy is your mother seemingly absent from a conflict in which your teenaged sister\u2019s appearance is being publicly attacked by a family member,\u201d not \u201cwhy didn\u2019t your mother scold you for defending her\u201d \n\nIt seemed odd to me that one of the parents of the teenager at the center of this dust-up did not say a single word about it, by your account.", "Fully agree.  But tbh not sure what her intentions were.  Maybe she didn\u2019t want to get involved, maybe she didn\u2019t feel the need to say anything because I already handled it.  She\u2019s the one who raised to not let anyone punk me or my siblings so tbh she probably agrees deep down but doesn\u2019t want to say anything to continue dragging on the conflict.  In my eyes it\u2019s over and I lost nothing, so mom\u2019s response means very little.  She too wasn\u2019t happy with Ashley\u2019s comments but didn\u2019t tell me I was wrong for my response.", "I hope she at least speaks to your sister in private and lets her know that she thinks Ashley was out of line, and that she supports your sister making her own choices when it comes to her hair."]}
