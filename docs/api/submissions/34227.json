She has beautiful natural red hair, and has been growing it for about 5-6 years.  My parents have not allowed her to cut or dye her hair as they don\u2019t want her to ruin her natural beauty.  I will preface this is not a family tradition or religious thing, they just like her natural hair.  For her 16th birthday she decided to cut it from the middle of her butt to about her shoulder blades.  My step dad\u2019s daughter (whom I am not close with nor claim as my sibling.  We\u2019ll call her Ashley) was supposed to show up with her husband and 2 kids with a specially prepared birthday cake.  Ashley has been decorating detailed specialized cakes for about 10 years now.  She committed to bringing to cake as well as going to go get dinner, but canceled last minute because it \u201cDidn\u2019t fit in her schedule.\u201d  This hurt my sister\u2019s feelings, so I went and bought Bundt Cakes for her with birthday candles to cheer her up.  Ashley sent her mother to our house to deliver the cake while we were out.  After we finished eating my other sister (19) had made a post with a picture of my sister on her Facebook wishing her a Happy Birthday.  Ashley made a comment on the post stating \u201cHappy Birthday, I love you, but you\u2019ll regret cutting your hair.  Your parents are ridiculous for letting you do something so stupid.\u201d  \nIn my eyes this comment was completely uncalled for and rude to say to a teen on her birthday.  There should never be a \u201cbut\u201d after \u201cI love you\u201d.  We left the restaurant and on the way home I responded to this mean girl hate comment saying \u201cKeep your negative, rude comments of my sister\u2019s appearance to your damn self instead of commenting them on Facebook.  Say Happy Birthday and move the fuck on.\u201d  When we got home I tried tell my mom about what I had said in response to her comment and Stepdad interjected, loudly disagreeing with my involvement in the problem and telling me that it\u2019s \u201cNot my place to say anything.\u201d  I responded that \u201cAs her big brother it is my place to defend her from anyone in or out of this family from disrespecting her and commenting on her appearance.\u201d  I later received a message from Ashley saying \u201cOur relationship is completely over, until you apologize so fuck you. You do not disrespect me, (sister\u2019s name spelt incorrectly) is old enough to call me and say that hurt her feelings. You just have really big Facebook balls.  Peace Out!\u201d\nI had no way of responding to the message as she blocked me from responding.  \n\nSo, am I the asshole for defending my teenage sister from a grown woman leaving a rude comment of her appearance?\n\nI feel personally that no matter who says anything rude about my sister I\u2019m going to stand up for her and speak my mind.

Maybe calling her out in the comments section was the wrong way to do it, but it was also just a reply to her comment.  Rudeness begets rudeness.

My only question is how does she fell about you calling people out on her behalf?

But it seems nothing is lost by loosing this relationship. So just ignore the situation and step sister.", "She definitely felt a little upset but only because it started an argument.  Stepdad usually ruins every family event with attitude including holidays and birthdays, so any bit if arguing caused could hurt her.  I thought about that after the fact, but I also feel that she knows I was just defending her.  The post was deleted before any of her friends or any other family members could view it, so the likelihood of embarrassment is low, more so just disappointment that there\u2019s another argument during a celebration.", "NTA\n\nShe is a grown woman who decided to bully a minor on her birthday.", "NTA.\n\n\nI was a super pale natural blonde until my late 30s.\n\nMy parents threatened me with disownment if I ever dared to do anything to my hair.

Sorry I know it's not a big part of the story. \n\nI couldn't quite get over that your parents wouldn't \"let\" your sister cut her own hair until she was 16. That seems a bit overboard. It's a pity that Ashley focused on her idea that your sister was making a mistake rather than on the fact that your sister was, as she should be, asserting her control over her own hair, which is something your sister should have been allowed to do years before.\n\nIt seems a bit inconsistent for Ashley to say something so disrespectful and unkind, on a public forum, about your sister on your sister's birthday, and then turn around and demand an apology from you because you criticized her.. on the same public forum. \n\nYou are NTA.
