Some people in Christianity (probably not Catholics though) even go 'church shopping' to find a church that suits them! Each of these interpret and teach the Bible differently (or don't actually teach it in some cases to be honest) Judaism has about 3-4 major denominations.", "NTA. I love the idea of giving your kids the chance to experience other religions. This lesson just also included the lesson of consent, bodily autonomy, and cultural respect.

You can't inoculate someone to trauma by giving them more trauma. \n\nThings that actually build emotional resilience are having a loving, supportive family who you have strong trust with and can ask for help/advice when needed. \n\nThen, when they need to face traumatic situations, they know they can go to the people who love them for help. Therapy also helps.", "NTA, they made the decision before even going and it should be respected.", "NTA Forcing your children in this case is just wrong. Let them decide for themselves in this case.

Forcing the girls into this situation then guilting them for being \u2018brats\u2019 is completely unreasonable. Yes, some other cultures will ask that women cover their heads in some places, but you live in a country where you can very easily work around that by respecting that community\u2019s boundaries and staying away from their religious space. \n\nYour children could learn about religions in other ways, not just by visiting places of worship. You could always reach out to religious leaders and explain that you\u2019re trying to teach your children about different religions, and would they consider meeting you as a family for coffee to talk about it, or could they suggest someone that would be willing to talk to you as a family? \n\nMaybe expose them to different cultures as well, not just different religions. If you have the money and resources, travelling abroad is a great way to broaden kids\u2019 minds. If your girls are into gender equality, Iceland is great- I went there and not only does it have incredible scenery and wildlife, sexism doesn\u2019t exist in the same way it does elsewhere.

You should call the imam (leader) ahead of time and see if they have to cover and if there is a spot in the back your whole family can sit together and watch, otherwise men will have to sit separately from women.

Other wise and this is just an assumption about your race) white saviour complex becomes a thing and people get resentful. Because if you don\u2019t understand the community/group you\u2019re fighting for you sound out of touch and condescending; like *I* know what\u2019s right for you. \n\nI know MANY activists who would respectfully cover their head when entering a mosque because it\u2019s the polite thing to do. I live in Mass and have done MANY multi faith activities over the years and every non-Muslim I\u2019ve encountered has politely worn a head covering because they are explained to why this is done and part of your whole experience is understanding different religions, ALL aspects but you\u2019ve clearly dropped the ball there. \n\nSecondly your youngest isn\u2019t required to wear a head covering so you forcing her to wear one is a you thing. \n\nALSO men DO have a dress code, they can\u2019t just rock up in short with no shirt and do whatever they want. They are indeed expected to dress in a certain manner and again if you bothered to do an iota of research you would see that many Muslim men actually do cover their head. It\u2019s not the same level of requirement but many very religious Muslim men consider it respectful that they cover their head as well. \n\nALSO all of the above bits aside you didn\u2019t even ask the mosque you just took it on yourself to say they would make your kids cover without an iota of proof to the contrary.

Why ignore the problems in other religions but not Islam?", "This is so annoying. YWBTA if you bring them.\n\nThe fact that your kids already feel oppressed by covering their hair to go to a mosque tells me that they\u2019re not mature enough to go. They need to start with reading some books instead. Or hire a Muslim scholar to come to your home if you\u2019re truly invested in their religious education, instead of taking advantage of the free labor of people in their place of worship. \n\nIf my parents told me as a child \u201cHey, we\u2019re going here for this purpose. We\u2019re wearing x out of respect for the people/place,\u201d it would have been a non-issue for me, because respecting other people (especially when I\u2019m going out of my way to share space with them, unsolicited) does not kick up negative emotions. I was taught tolerance, and to respect other people and their practices, regardless if I disagree with them. Are you seeing the opportunity for the real lesson here? \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnyway, please do not bring those kids to a mosque under duress. A place of worship is not a place for kids to make a spectacle of themselves by stereotyping the believers. And yes, pouting because they had to cover their hair is making a spectacle of themselves.

Ofc if you go to a country like Turkey they have rules that every woman needs to cover their hair and have longer pants/shirts to visit their iconic mosques.

If it is not possible where you live, she must find another way to introduce them to this religion.\n\nEdit: Moreover I am not sure of the context of the visit. I know some religious places have some specific times to welcome people who want learn about the religion so that can be a way to do it. However, watching a service to better understand a religion is a very strange way to do it because you won't get the meaning of what people are doing just by looking at them. And for the people who are believers, they can see it as non respectful. Where I live for exemple, you are welcome to visit churches except during services.

Aren't you interested in learning what people believe and how they worship? I admit this is different from this particular scenario bc I don't attend the services, but religion is such a big part of cultures and history that anytime I go somewhere as a tourist, I visit local churches/temples and take a guided tour if they offer them.

One learns to always respect the culture or seem entitled to the people of the culture visited.  If the world is explored in any way including within America, the daughters will run into this in some form or another and this should be a lesson learned when they are still small children.  My assessment is the same.  If the daughters don't learn this with head coverings in a mosque they will be confronted with another form of it, and like this one it is not about their rights but about respecting the culture.\n\nWe are finished discussing this.", "Well actually with the current state of affairs in Pakistan/Iran/Iraq/Afghanistan - are actually trying to stop the forced wearing of covers for women.

They literally are oppressed and uneducated as laws are in place to prevent women from getting an education. \n\nI believe the older daughter is coming at it as many women are; they want the freedom to choose. To be able to wear what they want are not be killed, disowned, jailed for doing so. The root of the social aspects are misogynistic\nSo if you think it's a white savior complex to not want to support a misogynistic religion; when they have the choice not to in a respectful way then yes it is just being a white savior.", "I\u2019m not sure you understand how the internet and public forums work.", "They are in Massachusetts not Iraq.

Are the Muslim women in Massachusets all being forced to cover their heads for fear of death? \n\nIf the value OP is trying to get out of this is teaching their kids about other cultures, then this is also an element of the culture they should learn about. Muslims don't just exist in the countries you mentioned, there's a vast, diverse, and deep Muslim American culture that it would benefit the kids to learn about. Now, there's definitely people who have explained the topic in depth from firsthand experience, which I don't have. But the point is, the same thing, even with the same basic origin, can have very different meanings in different cultures and that's also important for anyone to learn about", "Did I say all or did I say a lot? And I'm aware but the biggest conflicts are happening in those areas about head coverings. You can't deny that in those countries at this moment women are being arrested for not wearing their head coverings which they are doing in protest for the fact that they will be arrested disowned killed stone for not having them in the first place. They are creating the movement to change that philosophy. The very basis of the head coverings is that a woman will be in modest if she doesn't cover herself that is misogynistic because men have all the freedom to wear whatever they want to but women have to be modest. But in these modern times women are getting fed up with being killed for not wearing a head covering. So what they are doing is protesting and not wearing them. Because the point is they need the freedom to choose. That is a whole message they want the freedom to choose and it's not freedom if the choice is do what I say or die. \n\nI'm not saying all Muslims I'm not saying all arabics what I'm saying is this is the reality of what's happening in the world right now. They are essentially being forced when the society that they live in tell them that they were either die or be in jail if they don't cover up. That is forcing them to do something. That is a forceful choice it's just disguised as something that has more freedom to it. \n\nTo quote a very famous thing on am I the asshole subreddit 'it's not about the Iranian yogurt\"", "What is it if not force had their parents made them visit a mosque? For her it was force", "You have the right to choose if you want to wear head covering or not. But that is not true for a lot of people in a lot of countries- and that is a fact. It's not me saying that all Muslims are bad or all people who practice the religion or anything like that no I'm stating the clear fact that in those countries right now the movements and the civil unrest that's happening or because women are fundamentally in a different and lower societal place than the men are and they use religion as a way to force compliance.\n\nMy point is that the right to choose to wear a head covering. That means that women have the right to go I don't want to wear a head covering and not be killed not be stoned not be disowned by their family not be condemned not be kidnapped by the morality police on the streets. We are in a place of privilege and America where most of that is illegal. So we are talking about things and more of hypothetical abstract motions because it doesn't matter that it's in a different country apparently. It doesn't matter that the root and the main issue is happening in those countries based upon that culture. What does matter apparently is people in America going no it's okay it's okay for them to wear head coverings yes it's okay but that's not the point. It's always been okay for women to wear head coverings the problem comes when they want to take it off. That is what I'm saying.\n\nThat women deserve the right to choose what coverings to put on their body. And that right fundamentally does not exist as it stands in that religion at this moment which is why the women of that religion and that culture are fighting and dying in the streets that are so far away to you that it doesn't matter apparently. For that fundamental right that we are so freely debating right now.", "I sure hope you feel the same way about white women who choose to wear long skirts and collared shirts for modesty.", "I mean, sure, if you wanna consider dressing appropriately for a wedding, or church, or anything with a certain dress code \"forcing someone\"", "Okay, you wanna talk about the reality of the world for women wearing head coverings? Let's talk about how in the west, women (who wear them BY CHOICE) will be banned from wearing religious head coverings if they're associated with Islam, will be dress coded in school for them, will be ridiculed by non-muslims, like yourself, who think they know best for wearing \"such oppressive clothing\"? Or! Or! Better yet! People have them RIPPED OFF by total strangers in this country, and you don't need to look hard to find stories\n\nWe are not in Iran. We are in a place where people actually have to fight for the right TO CHOOSE what they CAN put on their body, in this exact context. Conveniently though, you seem to have forgotten that part", "Why would that matter. Are they being forced to wear that upon very real threat of death/pain? If not I don't care because it is their right and their freedom to wear whatever they want. That is my whole argument is that the religious and societal and cultural pressures put on Muslim females is inherently wrong because it is do this or die. \n\nMy whole argument is that women deserve the right to wear what they want, including head coverings. Without fear of death. The fear of afterlife consequences is something between their god and themselves. It's when those consequences happen in real life is when it becomes a problem. \n\nIf I all of a sudden went up to every single conservative Christian lady and told them they are not allowed to wear those long sleeves and collared shirts that they want to wear because it's deemed immoral and I now have the right to contact a police and have them taken away for it then yes that's a problem and people will get up in arms about that. Why is that not happening with these head coverings? Are females not allowed to decide that they don't want to wear a head covering even though they follow the Quran and they have all the other faith values in their lives? The point isn't that they can wear it the point is they're forced to wear it to follow their religion and a very real consequence of not wearing it is physical death not spiritual physical. \n\nIf I could just call the police because someone was wearing something I didn't like; and that person would be taken away and either disowned (which is a terrible thing) stoned (again which is a terrible thing) honor killed (which is a terrible thing) or taken away to jail (which is a terrible thing)-  then how is it okay morally? How is imposing my idea of morality on to another person okay?\n\nI'm just saying that they need a chance to have that choice. They don't currently have that."]}
