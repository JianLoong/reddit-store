Some people in Christianity (probably not Catholics though) even go 'church shopping' to find a church that suits them! Each of these interpret and teach the Bible differently (or don't actually teach it in some cases to be honest) Judaism has about 3-4 major denominations.", "NTA. I love the idea of giving your kids the chance to experience other religions. This lesson just also included the lesson of consent, bodily autonomy, and cultural respect.

You can teach kids about the world in a healthy, non-traumatizing way. \n\nYour wife seems to think it's good to \"pre-traumatize\" the kids so they're better prepared for trauma they'll face later but, uh, that's not how trauma works. You can't inoculate someone to trauma by giving them more trauma. \n\nThings that actually build emotional resilience are having a loving, supportive family who you have strong trust with and can ask for help/advice when needed. \n\nThen, when they need to face traumatic situations, they know they can go to the people who love them for help. Therapy also helps.", "NTA, they made the decision before even going and it should be respected.", "NTA Forcing your children in this case is just wrong. Let them decide for themselves in this case.

Forcing the girls into this situation then guilting them for being \u2018brats\u2019 is completely unreasonable. Yes, some other cultures will ask that women cover their heads in some places, but you live in a country where you can very easily work around that by respecting that community\u2019s boundaries and staying away from their religious space. \n\nYour children could learn about religions in other ways, not just by visiting places of worship. You could always reach out to religious leaders and explain that you\u2019re trying to teach your children about different religions, and would they consider meeting you as a family for coffee to talk about it, or could they suggest someone that would be willing to talk to you as a family? \n\nMaybe expose them to different cultures as well, not just different religions. If you have the money and resources, travelling abroad is a great way to broaden kids\u2019 minds. If your girls are into gender equality, Iceland is great- I went there and not only does it have incredible scenery and wildlife, sexism doesn\u2019t exist in the same way it does elsewhere.

Also a lot of different cultures cover their hair for modesty. In my jewish community some married women wear wigs. Some dont. I think its cool you're exposing your kids to different religions.

You should call the imam (leader) ahead of time and see if they have to cover and if there is a spot in the back your whole family can sit together and watch, otherwise men will have to sit separately from women.

Other wise and this is just an assumption about your race) white saviour complex becomes a thing and people get resentful. Because if you don\u2019t understand the community/group you\u2019re fighting for you sound out of touch and condescending; like *I* know what\u2019s right for you. \n\nI know MANY activists who would respectfully cover their head when entering a mosque because it\u2019s the polite thing to do. I live in Mass and have done MANY multi faith activities over the years and every non-Muslim I\u2019ve encountered has politely worn a head covering because they are explained to why this is done and part of your whole experience is understanding different religions, ALL aspects but you\u2019ve clearly dropped the ball there. \n\nSecondly your youngest isn\u2019t required to wear a head covering so you forcing her to wear one is a you thing. \n\nALSO men DO have a dress code, they can\u2019t just rock up in short with no shirt and do whatever they want. They are indeed expected to dress in a certain manner and again if you bothered to do an iota of research you would see that many Muslim men actually do cover their head. It\u2019s not the same level of requirement but many very religious Muslim men consider it respectful that they cover their head as well. \n\nALSO all of the above bits aside you didn\u2019t even ask the mosque you just took it on yourself to say they would make your kids cover without an iota of proof to the contrary.

Why ignore the problems in other religions but not Islam?", "This is so annoying. YWBTA if you bring them.\n\nThe fact that your kids already feel oppressed by covering their hair to go to a mosque tells me that they\u2019re not mature enough to go. They need to start with reading some books instead. Or hire a Muslim scholar to come to your home if you\u2019re truly invested in their religious education, instead of taking advantage of the free labor of people in their place of worship. \n\nIf my parents told me as a child \u201cHey, we\u2019re going here for this purpose. We\u2019re wearing x out of respect for the people/place,\u201d it would have been a non-issue for me, because respecting other people (especially when I\u2019m going out of my way to share space with them, unsolicited) does not kick up negative emotions. I was taught tolerance, and to respect other people and their practices, regardless if I disagree with them. Are you seeing the opportunity for the real lesson here? \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnyway, please do not bring those kids to a mosque under duress. A place of worship is not a place for kids to make a spectacle of themselves by stereotyping the believers. And yes, pouting because they had to cover their hair is making a spectacle of themselves.

The very basis of the head coverings is that a woman will be in modest if she doesn't cover herself that is misogynistic because men have all the freedom to wear whatever they want to but women have to be modest.

Especially because that's the whole point of your introducing them to different religious practices. \n\nDo the research. Perhaps even try reaching out to local Imams and Muslim women/girls for their own interpretations, and either relate those to your girls or have them sit in so they can ask their own questions. As long as you're respectful and not accusatory, many religious communities will be happy to discuss their beliefs with you and your daughters.
