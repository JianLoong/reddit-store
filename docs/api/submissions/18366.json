However I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s seems to be a thing in the US to tell the father of an unexpected pregnancy that they can choose to walk away. That creates situations like this. Why push to be a single mom without atleast financial support?", "NTA post all you want about your son.", "NTA\n\nHe knew what could happen when he was having fun time. Don't try to hide your baby, but don't try to get back at him either. Like you said, you gave ample opportunity for him to get out. If he didn't want to tell his family because they would be upset with him, then that's between them. You enjoy your new tiny human. Congratulations!", "NTA.  You have every right to celebrate the birth of your child. It is a wonderful event!  If anyone asks who the father is (which is really rude to ask), just say the father is aware and supportive. You don't owe anyone anything more. As for the father, hopefully he grows up and is able to be part of his child's life. I wish you an easy and peaceful delivery!", "NTA you deserve to be happy and proud and share it with anyone you want. It\u2019s up to you.

You don't have to ask permission, just let him know 'by the way, I'm planning to announce the birth on x site next week'. Make sure you give him a few days, so not past earlier than you say you will, and let him do with that information what you will. \n\nAnd by the way, he's probably not so much ashamed of you and your baby as he is ashamed that he doesn't feel capable of supporting you. Most people wouldn't be as embarrassed about having a kid earlier than they planned as they would about being called a deadbeat. So don't feel bad about yourself or your choice. He's probably ashamed of *himself*, not you, and he's just going to have to work that out on his own.", "NTA - he is keeping your baby a dirty little secret because he doesn\u2019t want the unwanted questions from peers or pressure from his parents to step up and be responsible. \n\nLive your life and don\u2019t be afraid to show the world your joy.

That way, if he hasn't told his family he can, before they see your posts.", "NTA. Don't let his reluctance steal your joy in sharing the news with those you love and those that support you. \n\nAnd not that you asked, at all, for this advice, and it may be something you've already done, but you need to work with a lawyer and get a legal and binding agreement with the baby's father regarding child support and custody issues ASAP. Things may b cordial now, but that could change and he could decide to not offer any financial support, or that he wants the kid after all and wants to move them to Australia. I AM NOT TRYING TO SCARE YOU but please, get those legal documents up and running. \n\nAnd congratulations too.", "You can post it.

His family also deserve to know about your Child and again if he's stepped down that is now on you.

To share this news with your own family and friends is entirely appropriate - but you should avoid antagonising your co-parenting relationship. If your social media has the option of selecting who you post to use that. Don\u2019t tag him or anything. \n\nHe is obviously not coping and freaking out about this massive change to his life. Yes your life is changing so much more - but that does not change the fact that his is completely changing too. \n\nYou mention giving the option of him \u201copting out\u201d - but that\u2019s a mythical option. He can\u2019t opt out - no matter what he does or does not do he is about to become a father. \n\nYou need to focus on yourself and your Bub right now - and I\u2019m not suggesting that you should focus on his ability to cope and respond to this - but I do wish he had someone in his life he trusted and could speak with and would direct him to support so he could do better. He obviously cares - but he\u2019s also clearly not doing ok. \n\nIf nothing else - share the news with him directly (you or a trusted family member) and give him the opportunity to share this news with his family directly as a first step. You don\u2019t need to be sharing the news on social media immediately. Give yourself a few days to just focus on yourself and bub - and in turn give him a few days too. \n\nCongratulations on becoming a mom", "NTA.  Celebrate that baby mama!! He can suck it up.", "NTA but I would at least consider asking him to sign away his parental rights. Have seen too many cases where the dad flakes until the kid stops shitting themselves and crying and starts being fun and able to talk, and they suddenly reappear and decide it's time for them to have a go on the new toy, and put their stamp on their handiwork.\n\nHe's shown you he's willing to make this all about him - I mean you're literally considering hiding the birth of your first child from your friends and family because of this guy's feels - consider the likelihood that he'll be willing to do it again and again.", "NTA - Post away!", "He had like 6 months to get his shit together and make an announcement. He can't tape your mouth shut because he doesn't want to step up and deal with the baby situation that he literally caused. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, just a couple quick questions, how do you think his family will react? Do you think his family may try to change his mind and or attempt to get custody of your child? Honestly I\u2019d just keep it quiet. Don\u2019t put him on the birth certificate.", "yeah idk either to be honest LOL my thought process was that i wanted my baby to have a dad who was there 100%, rather than one who resents him for existing and resents me for keeping the baby. seems like i got that either way though \ud83e\udd23 in the beginning, i would have been ok with him walking away, but at this point after months of telling me he would support us and love us and then changing his mind, he\u2019s definitely gonna have to be financially responsible at the very least!", "absolutely agree!! i plan to just post to those i have on my friends list and everything else is private:) thank you for the advice!!! it\u2019s definitely good to keep that in mind", "in my opinion, i don\u2019t think his family or friends would react badly at all, especially considering a lot of his friends are getting married and having children now. his parents have sadly both passed away, which just leaves the family portion of breaking the news to his aunts/uncles and his older brother, who is also married", "I honestly think that it\u2019s internalized misogyny. (Not criticizing you but society) In my home country it\u2019s even illegal not to ask for child support. And really it doesn\u2019t serve your kid as much as it serves him. My father wasn\u2019t in my life at all (except for the financial support) and I still felt extremely rejected. Like I obviously knew that all the other kids had dads, so I noticed that mine apparently didn\u2019t care for me even though nobody ever said it. You both were part of getting you pregnant, you shouldn\u2019t carry his responsibility too. I think you can and should expect more of him, generally. Meaning also, you don\u2019t have to cover for him being a coward by not posting.", "Just work out all angles in your head before making a decision. I personally decided to not allow pictures of my kid on the internet. Too many creeps manipulating kid photos and when my son is an adult I don\u2019t want an online childhood persona to suddenly become an issue.", "It\u2019s INCEL culture and \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d groups who have created this culture.", "this op! people talk about stranger danger but it\u2019s usually the people that\u2019s close to you that you need to watch out for because you trust them you never suspect them", "Because I'm tired, I misinterpreted this to mean that you were posting the actual birth (like a video) on social media! If you were that person, definitely an asshole. Some things are sacred. \n\nNTA here though.

Be honest about his parentage and your circumstances. He doesn\u2019t get to decide that you or your child are somehow shameful things to be hidden. I\u2019d consult a lawyer both in the US and Australia to find out what the legal possibilities are - maybe you\u2019d be better off listing him as the father, and maybe not, if he\u2019s going to act like this and be so indifferent/hostile to his own child.", "NTA. It\u2019s your child and you are letting people know of his birth. You\u2019re not putting it out there to be spiteful. I would tell him all the details before posting on social media, but you are not required to get his permission.", "NTA\n\nIt's your kid, regardless of his immature behavior or not, the BF still has obligations", "NTA\n\nWhat are you going to do? Never post anything? It's a human, unless you're in some kinda movie we don't know about, you can't really keep creating a human secret for long\n\nCelebrate your lil miracle. Post pics of your baby. You MADE that lil thing! That's incredible! If you're worried about him, just don't mention him. Make it all about you and your kid. He's already checking out. Don't let him hold you back from celebrating something big.", "NTA- it\u2019s your baby , he made it clear he doesn\u2019t want to be a father so it\u2019s not his decision. If you want to post about your baby do it. If he has a problem with it he can shove it. That\u2019s a him problem not a you problem.\n\nCongratulations on your miracle baby, enjoy every moment of it and try not to let (bf/ex bf?) bring you down!", "NTA\nDo not hide your kid's existence because his dad's a flake.", "NTA.  It is your child that you once thought you could never have and you are giving birth - CELEBRATE!!", "He is being ridiculous unfair to his own parents. He may not want a relationship with the child but the parents may.\nNTA", "I'd play dumb.  \"Seriously, he didn't tell you?!\"  \"Seriously?\"", "lol no.

If the family comes at you (because he will probably lie to them to save face), show them the texts he sent you.", "NTA. It kind of sounds like you're worried about the fact that he suddenly has to realize that the kid is real and here. And that everyone will know about him.\n\nHe better get used to it.", "NTA and I totally support this comment but I would suggest, for the sake of you wanting to coparent as best as possible, you warn him your plans. Even something as simple as \"FYI, I've got so many people asking to be told when Junior arrives safely, I've said I'll put out a Facebook update. Did you want me to message you directly first or are you happy to look for the general post?\"\n\n\nBefore I get shot down with the people asking why the effort should be on OP - it totally should not. But. She has given the impression in the post that she is a lovely person and concerned with being perceived as petty. I think OP is already doing a wonderful job of putting her baby first and my suggestion is based more around keeping the peace with the indecisive sperm donor. Good luck with the induction!", "I\u2019m not going to touch the financial aspect because the fact that there\u2019s a child that needs to be supported complicated things, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for a man (or woman) to decide not to be in their kid\u2019s life at all (as long as this decision was made when they weren\u2019t born yet/newborn).\n\nThink about it like this: if both parents can decide to give a baby up for adoption, that\u2019s not a bad thing. Just because they don\u2019t both agree on the same thing doesn\u2019t mean one has to stay. Having sex doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ready to be a parent. Separating yourself from the kid at birth is a valid decision - it\u2019s like a one sided adoption.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to pay $X a month to support your child but being a parent is something you have to want. You also can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t force someone to be a parent.\n\nEdit: words, fixed up my articulation a bit.", "Of course, having sex doesn\u2019t make you a suitable parent. But not caring for your child is incredibly inconsiderate towards the child. It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t learn to be a parent as well as you\u2019re able too. Everybody knows that any heterosexual sex bears the risk of pregnancy, so think about consequences. Adults use seemingly bad situations they didn\u2019t expect for growth.", "I would actually argue that in this scenario, it\u2019s the most considerate thing you can do for the child. It\u2019s better to walk away when they\u2019re too young to remember you and stay gone than either a) leave when they\u2019re old enough to feel abandoned or b) go in and out of their life or c) be a shitty parent.\n\n> it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t learn to be a parent as well as you\u2019re able to\n\nThe thing about being a parent is it\u2019s not just a job but a lifelong commitment. Once you\u2019re a parent you\u2019re always a parent. You may be able to learn to change diapers but you can\u2019t learn to fully love and devote yourself to another person.\n\nAnd frankly I don\u2019t think anyone should have to. Parenting is 18 years of work with no breaks followed by a lifetime of being on call. That\u2019s not something we should force people to do, people have a right to lead their own lives. Adults use bad situations to grow but it\u2019s unrealistic to expect someone to totally transform their life.\n\n> so think about the consequences\n\nOn principle I agree but unfortunately humans are hardwired to have sex at least some point in their lives. It\u2019s not realistic to expect everyone to be a total virgin for life because they don\u2019t want kids. We have modern medicine to mitigate the risks but it can fail. This isn\u2019t a realistic statement, and it\u2019s the same one pro-lifers use: should women not be able to get abortions because they knew the risks?", "Well, I don\u2019t agree. My father left before I was even born and yet I felt abandoned. A child would have to be very stupid to not notice the lack of his dad even when he disappeared years ago. \nThe man in question here doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s 18\u2026 then I might be a little less harsh. \nObviously women should be able to get abortions. But it\u2019s different because they are actually the ones pregnant and also usually the ones having to sacrifice way more for their children. \nAt least financially, she should definitely hold him responsible. Emotionally you obviously can\u2019t force anyone but it\u2019s not right to make excuses for them. Being an AH ain\u2019t illegal but that doesn\u2019t change the fact itself", "I'm not saying it isn't a shitty situation. Obviously it would be better if everyone who got pregnant/someone pregnant wanted to be a parent, but that's not the reality. Considering the circumstances it really is the best option. Do you think you would've felt less abandoned if your father left when you were older? Or less abandoned if he stayed but didn't love you? Sometimes you have to work with the hand that's been dealt and minimize the damage.\n\nThere's a lot of ways \"deadbeat\" parents can be assholes but giving your child to someone else when you can't fill the role doesn't make you an asshole.", "But that\u2019s just it: why does the child have to deal with the hand they\u2019re dealt but the parent doesn\u2019t have to deal with the hand they dealt themselves? Life quite often is not about what we want but good people still do many of them\u2026 and while you can\u2019t necessarily force emotions, taking financial responsibility is possible for every decent person who\u2019s willing. \nAnd I don\u2019t really know how it would have felt in another situation. It would have been nice to see him at least try though.", "When it comes to dealing the hands your dealt there\u2019s a difference between still having freedom of choice vs not. It\u2019s not the same thing to deal with a bad childhood and still live your life the way you want vs try to force someone to be a parent.\n\nGood people step up and be parents. Good people also put their kids up for adoption (and imo one parent letting the other raise the kid is the same principle).\n\nI\u2019m not disagreeing on the financial aspect. It\u2019s not much to ask that someone pay a bit of money every month."]}
