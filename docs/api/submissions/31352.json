Care to enlighten?", "NTA There is no point having a \"safe word\" if you refuse to use it when it comes to the crunch -- exactly as a scammer would do. It is unfortunate that you were both out of it, but that's more reason to have your safe word memorized and ready to go, not less of a reason.\n\nIf in your half-asleep state you'd given money to a scammer I doubt he'd be happy you had decided to trust the voice: \"It's me! What safe word? Just send me money.\" I think you'd be getting a lecture on the safe word's importance.\n\nETA: On another point though, you'd better keep in mind that if you get a call like that in the future you'd better get out of bed to take the call so you don't react while half-asleep, hang up, and fall back asleep as you did here. You need to be ready to get yourself fully awake for true emergencies.", "NTA. What is the point of having a safe word, if your husband can't be bothered to use it. You were right to be concerned that it might be a scam.", "NTA.

She wants to stay half-sleepy if possible, since she needs to get back to sleep.  Someone who doesn't know the safeword calls and wakes her up and asks for money.  In other words, a probable scammer.  She has no duty to sacrifice badly needed sleep for a scammer.\n\nAnd then her husband went out, at night, with absolutely no idea what to do if his car died.  He had no roadside assistance set up, no money available, so if anything went wrong he had to call his wife and have her set up a money transfer.  In other words, really bad planning.  As long as I've got my wallet, I've got cash and cards that aren't at their limit, and I can get roadside assistance.

You could have asked for any other identity confirming info. You could have just put the money on one of the cards. I can see worryingly about getting scammed, but what is the likelihood of getting scammed to put money on your own card? The only way that would make sense is if someone stole the card and had enough info to call you, likely meaning his wallet was stolen - in that case you don\u2019t roll over and go to sleep either.", "Holy cow YTA. Reverse the positions. You're broken down, alone, in an unfamiliar location, with no resources. You call your husband for help but instead of trying to figure it out he's like \"nah sleepy, sorry\".

You have a safeword for this reason.  I am glad everything worked out for the best, but that was the point of creating all of that.  I have had friends get calls where it sounds exactly like someone, but it wasn't that person.", "NTA. I mean what\u2019s the point of a password if he isn\u2019t going to use it? \nStressed or not it\u2019s not hard to remember a conversation.

If you have a safe word that you don\u2019t change regularly then you probably did the right thing", "YTA You can\u2019t be serious.\n\n Your husband wasn\u2019t home and needed help.\n\n You could have asked any number of questions to verify his identity, like anniversaries, your hair color, the number of siblings you each have or something else, literally anything. \n\n Instead you decided to hang up and go to sleep!!! \n\nYou are unreal! Begging for his forgiveness might be a good place to start, but I doubt it will help.", "YTA on this one. If the call was real, he was in a very bad position. You should have kept talking to verify it was him and why he hadn't given the safe word right away. If you kept talking, you'd have known he was nervous and was drawing a blank on the word. If you kept talking, he'd have had a chance to calm down and remember it. By hanging up, under the claimed circumstances he might not have been able to borrow another phone.", "nta. it's always better to be safe than sorry especially when it comes to protecting yourself and your finances. trust is important but trust should also be earned and maintained. it's understandable that you didn't feel comfortable in that situation considering the potential risks involved. your husband should understand and respect your concerns instead of getting angry. communication and understanding are key in any relationship.", "YTA\n\nYou hung up on him. Instead of trying to see if it really was him or be a bit more patient.\n\nYour husband is not next to you, so you know there's a possibility it was him.

I get that you guys have a safe word because you're paranoid but that was just petty and childish.

Precautions are in place for a reason", "Your husband's out there, car kaput, and you're worried about scam artists pulling some 3 AM heist? The dude needed help, not a pop quiz on secret passwords.

Rules are rules .\"", "What have you learned from the incident?", "Massive YTA. Transfering money to a known account of his would have posed absolutely no security risk. The scams all involve wiring money onto unknown account numbers and/or gift cards. He was distressed and needed help and under distress people tend to get caught up in the situation and forget arbitrary information that is not used on a regular basis", "YTA you just hung up and went back to sleep without a care for if your husband was actually in an emergency situation? Absolutely nutty. I would say ESH since he should understand the safety words use but you messed up big time not trying to verify it's him and just going \"Nah, no safe word. G'night\".

C'mon that's willfully spite.", "I'd say YTA because there's other ways to determine if it's your husband. You said it sounded like him. Id want to make absolutely sure my husband was okay.

I wouldn't forgive that.", "Yeah that's the part that makes you an AH", "NTA-that\u2019s why you had a safe word. But, since the plan didn\u2019t work, you need to rejig it. Maybe ask about something you\u2019ll both remember like your anniversary", "But you didn't even try to see if it was or not, you just hung up.", "Yea, but how can someone be pretending be your husband? How can someone fake a conversation with you?", "You're right! Everyone should react the exact same way to things! No one is ever allowed to break their composure and no one is allowed to be more stressed out by a situation than what ihertzwhenip says! \n\n/s. Obviously.", "Asking for the safe word again is the absolute worst you could do?", "Yeah, that would be a big no-no.", "1. It was a one time thing and she would have realized if it wasn't him\n\n2. She didn't try to see it was him.\n\nI'm not deffending that she should have given the money without further inquiry. But hunging up was an AH thing to do and I'd be pissed out of my mind had my partner done this to me.", "Exactly. I feel sorry for their marriage xD", "My husband and I are both too dense for this to be viable.  \"Hey, love, what did you have for breakfast?\"  \"I had breakfast?\"", "She knew her husband was not home, it was 3am and it sounded like him. It was not a random call, during the day. This call had merit to it, enough to warrant more than her lame attempt of a safe word.", "No kidding! \n\nCan you just imagine this in reverse? \n\n  \nI (40m) was sleeping on couch watching college football when my wife called, I recognized her voice, blah, blah, blah, she didn\u2019t know the safe word, blah, blah, blah, it was the third quarter, but I was really tired, so I hung up. I fell back asleep and my team didn\u2019t even win. Aita?", "Especially when she knows he isn\u2019t there with her.", "You\u2019re right, she should stay on the phone with someone who is claiming to be her husband but not doing what they agreed to do in this case.  That\u2019s not a recipe for someone potentially ratcheting up an emotional response at all!", "Again, from a security perspective yes.  Anything that keeps the convo going and engages you more is the wrong move.", "If you were my partner, and you put yourself into this situation and were pissed at me about it?  After you were unable to remember a password that you yourself helped to think up, and acted like it was new information to you?  Then we wouldn't be partners very long.\n\nWhat stopped OP's hubs from calling back once he remembered the password?  Or is he just so dysfunctional that he needs a doctor to check his memory?  I see no way in which this is OP's fault - OP didn't turn the phone off after hanging up or anything like that.  Again, he put himself into this situation, and if you did the same and were pissed at someone else for your own failings, that's on you.", "If you\u2019re just looking to flip the genders, why would you replace being tired because of caring for a baby (which is unavoidable and long-term) with being tired because you\u2019re watching a late night football game (entirely optional and infrequent)?\n\nObviously people would be more critical of the person in your scenario because it\u2019s not the same.", "You'd be butchered in the comments, no doubt.", "I don't know why he didn't call again. I don't know if you could have or not, OP didn't provide any information on that.\n\nI'm not saying the husband is completely in the clear, but OP is definitely the bigger AH.\n\nAnd if my partner hung their phone up on me like that forcing me to fend by myself at 3am, I agree, we wouldn't be in a relationship much longer.", "The baby was at home with him of course, That\u2018s why he was sleeping during his game. I figured that was obvious. What guy sleeps during his football game?", "Of course. This is Reddit. \ud83d\ude02"]}
