Care to enlighten?", "NTA There is no point having a \"safe word\" if you refuse to use it when it comes to the crunch -- exactly as a scammer would do. It is unfortunate that you were both out of it, but that's more reason to have your safe word memorized and ready to go, not less of a reason.\n\nIf in your half-asleep state you'd given money to a scammer I doubt he'd be happy you had decided to trust the voice: \"It's me! What safe word? Just send me money.\" I think you'd be getting a lecture on the safe word's importance.\n\nETA: On another point though, you'd better keep in mind that if you get a call like that in the future you'd better get out of bed to take the call so you don't react while half-asleep, hang up, and fall back asleep as you did here.

She wants to stay half-sleepy if possible, since she needs to get back to sleep.  Someone who doesn't know the safeword calls and wakes her up and asks for money.  In other words, a probable scammer.  She has no duty to sacrifice badly needed sleep for a scammer.\n\nAnd then her husband went out, at night, with absolutely no idea what to do if his car died.  He had no roadside assistance set up, no money available, so if anything went wrong he had to call his wife and have her set up a money transfer.  In other words, really bad planning.  As long as I've got my wallet, I've got cash and cards that aren't at their limit, and I can get roadside assistance.

I can see worryingly about getting scammed, but what is the likelihood of getting scammed to put money on your own card?

Begging for his forgiveness might be a good place to start, but I doubt it will help.", "YTA on this one. If the call was real, he was in a very bad position. You should have kept talking to verify it was him and why he hadn't given the safe word right away. If you kept talking, you'd have known he was nervous and was drawing a blank on the word.

I would be utterly pissed wtf", "NAH, you did what you needed to do and was agreed upon by you both, in order to protect yourself and your husband from financial fraud. Your husband in a moment of great mental stress and frustration, ended up forgetting the safeword in the same way that someone may forget their password to an important account.\n\nHowever, your plan had a design flaw when it came to account recovery, or in this case \"safe word recovery\", which usually involves getting identification which specific relates to your husband (such as historical home address or marital status) which gives you both an alternative, but secure way for him to identify himself.\n\nThe comments saying anyone is an asshole just have a high horse they need to be on.\n\nThere is no assholes here, just a lesson to be learned in why institutions offer a password recovery process or alternative authentication processes.\n\nAcknowledge your husband had the right to be angry, ask to be affirmed that you were tired and scams at that time of day are not uncommon and then propose the addition of security questions, which will benefit your entire family going forward.", "What's the point of a safe word if he doesn't want to use?\n\nScammers will always try to do things in a rush to not give you time to think, so the \"it was an emergency\" card really doesn't make sense, as it's what a scammer would say.\n\nNTA, but maybe you shouldn't have gone back to sleep right away.", "Yta. I get that you guys have a safe word because you're paranoid but that was just petty and childish.

It's totally reasonable for OP, who lives in a country where scams are really common, to think one was using this technique instead of it actually being her husband.

They came up with a smart, quick way to determine if they're dealing with each other instead of a scammer-how does it make sense for OP to continue engaging when he already failed the test? Spending more time on the phone with a scammer when you're half-awake is dangerous-even if OP doesn't intend to give info, it could still have slipped out of her given her mental state at the moment, and if it had been a *real* scammer on the line, that would have been bad. \n\n>I can see worryingly about getting scammed, but what is the likelihood of getting scammed to put money on your own card?\n\nBc if it was a scammer, he could have asked her to do it in a way that gave him the money instead, like downloading a money transfering app or something. Sure, it's not as likely as other tactics, but scammers will try *anything.* Or, maybe a scammer somehow got a hold of one of the cards or it's information and was trying to get OP to transfer money to it.

This was the 80s, before cell phones or approved school pick up lists, and I didn\u2019t know this at the time but there was some local fear about people kidnapping kids by telling them their parents sent them.

It sucks that it turned out to actually be her husband, but everyone would tell you that it is safer to hang up on someone you believe to be a scammer instead of letting the call go on-I can't really think of anyone who would *encourage* you to stay on the line with a scammer. \n\n>He said to put the money on one of their cards. She could have, and should have, said ok and hung up and put money on one of their cards.\n\nI really don't know why you're acting like this is some surefire way to guarantee it wasn't a scammer calling. Say it was a scammer and OP stayed on the line-maybe the scammer would have tried asking the details of the card OP just transferred money to, or asked for the details of the transfer, or something along those lines. Or maybe if OP actually went to transfer the money, they would have asked for a specific card then. Scammers will use any means necessary, and they try to be sneakier and sneaker about it-I can see how it'd be a smart tactic to ask for a money transfer to \"any\" card and then ask for a specific one at crunch time when they know they have their victim locked down.\n\nWhy would you ever risk letting the scammer think you're falling for their schemes instead of just hanging up? Like honestly, if you genuinely believe the person on the phone is a scammer and not your husband bc they deliberately didn't say the safeword and even acted like they didn't know about it by saying \"what safe word\", why would you even bother putting money on one of your cards?

This is even why most banks use security questions instead.
