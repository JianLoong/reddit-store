He has severe sleep apnea. Took him about 6 weeks to get used to the CPAP, but they were able to convince him how dangerous his apnea is so he stuck to it. He still hasn't moved back into my room, because we actually like it. We have different schedules, and I like my pillows just so. Lol. We just got back from a 3 night trip (first since he got the CPAP). Slept in the same bed, and was literally the first vacation I've been able to sleep next to him without ear plugs and sleep meds.

It is a serious health issue, he probably has no idea how bad he is sleeping, and once he's gotten this addressed, you will both be well rested and happier. And stress that they now do the studies at home. This may help convince him.", "NTA. Many men get relegated to the guest room or couch for snoring.
