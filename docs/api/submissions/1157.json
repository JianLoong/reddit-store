You  want to see your dog, have some personal time etc..", "NTA. Can't tell if it's an N A H case though. I understand she just went through major surgery but at the same time, you've been there 24/7 for two weeks so this guilt trip of 'not wanting to be with her' seems a little over the top. Not asking for the details, but is this a major, life-altering surgery that is causing her some level of depression? Or lots and lots of pain and complications?", "NTA\n\nThis is ridiculous. She makes it look like you are walking out of her life, when you'll only be gone for a day or so. Honestly, you would be TA if you didn't go see your dog for much longer.", "NAH. You definitely deserve this one day to go take care of your own things. Your gf is probably feeling trapped and that's why she's upset that you can go do your own thing while she has to lay in bed while people take care of her. Totally understandable on her part.", "NAH.\n\nYou've spent the last 2-1/2 weeks taking care of her practically every spare moment. You deserve a break.  You deserve to see your dog and even to just chill at your own place for a little while before your trip.\n\nYour GF is not an AH for wanting you to stay, or for pouting a bit that you want to go.  She's probably feeling a bit vulnerable due to being dependent on you, maybe she's worried you have gotten tired of her.  So don't push back at her for this or start an argument.  Just go see your dog and enjoy your trip.  The break will be good for both of you.", "NTA. She\u2019s going through a hard time but you haven\u2019t done anything wrong", "**NTA.** You have needs too, and caregiver burnout is very real. You are also entitled to your own time to yourself. Your girlfriend is taking this *far* too personally and needs to recognize that while you are happy to care for her and help her recover, and while she is absolutely vulnerable right now, it is perfectly okay for you to want to spend time in your own space before going away for a weekend. And your dog needs you too. I assume you've had the dog taken care of in your absence, but it's hard for pets to be away from their humans for a long time, too. \n\nYou've taken the appropriate steps to ensure that your girlfriend is cared for, and she needs to recognize that even if her needs are the higher priority right now, that doesn't invalidate your own.", "I\u2019m going to say, NTA.  It\u2019s very admirable that you have given two weeks of your time to stay with your GF after surgery.  You do have responsibilities of your own to take care of that she should understand.  You have seemed to cover all of your bases for her care to tend to your own needs.  Your GF is very selfish and needy to demand you stay.  Unless she is fully not on her feet after 2 weeks post op and absolutely cannot take care of herself, there\u2019s no reason you need to be there 24/7."]}
