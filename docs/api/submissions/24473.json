The new wife didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d anything, your daughter threw it away.", "NTA.\n\nGeena needed to hear the truth. Geena is delusional if she thinks Madison caused the mess. I think Geena had \"grass is greener\" syndrome. And now... she is realizing the grass wasn't greener on the other side. \n\nI hope your ex-son-in-law and Madison work out.

I'm sure it wasn't your intention to see your daughter cry but she needs the truth that this is all her fault as opposed to what your wife is doing.

Maybe tell her to stop complaining so much while she lives with you.", "NTA. I wouldn't apologize for stating the truth.", "All you did was tell her the truth.

And in her quest to keep up appearances/keep up with her ex she's denied the reality of her situation, leading her to move back in with her parents. Maybe you should suggest to Geena consulting with therapists and financial advisors will help her develop a plan out of her current situation, which is clearly making her unhappy?

It sounds like she'll never actually find happiness. I have to think when someone makes this decision once they'll just make it again. No amount of pain prevents a repeat of the same action.
