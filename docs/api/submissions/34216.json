My father died 10 months ago, leaving the house to me, and the \u201cright to usufruct\u201d(I used Google Translate for this) to my mother.   \nMy main income comes from renting out my apartments (1 3 bedroom, where we lived before, and two one-bedroom) and after my dad\u2019s passing, I started working in a grocery store 3 days a week, 12 hours a day.  \nAfter my father\u2019s death, my mother\u2019s reign started: she started constantly criticizing me and my kids but in the most petty ways possible. I tried to de-escalate calmly these situations, I even asked her if she wanted us to move out, and I tried to find ways to coexist in peace.  \nAt the end of November, while I was, there was a big snow, and my daughters (11,13yo) went out and played in the snow, Mom lost it on them, calling me and them every name in the book, and how we are lucky, that she didn\u2019t throw us out to the streets. The reason: the snow was pretty, and they messed it up, and they would bring mud to the house (they didn\u2019t. They left their boots on the terrace)  \nWe had a big fight, and she claimed, she wanted to be finally alone, we\u2019re noisy, we should be more grateful that we don\u2019t have to pay rent to her, etc. I was like okay, we\u2019re moving out.  \nMy tenants ended their lease in November in my big apartment, I just wanted to do some minor renovations before renting it out again, but I was like F it, I can live with the stained old carpets for now, and we started to move back. I had to dip into my savings, and my kids got new furniture for Christmas, but it was worth it. We were even lucky with the school, my kids can go to the same class and friends they had to leave behind five years ago.   \nThe problem starts from here. Mom got a reality check today when she realized she can\u2019t afford that house. We use coal and gas for heating, and it\u2019s a big old house with old windows and no insulation in the brick walls, so the heating cost is high.  (I planned to renovate it in the spring, but after my income significantly dropped I can\u2019t afford it)  \nWell, the gas bill arrived and it's 70% of her paycheck (she's on gov. assistance and has a part-time job)  \nI was the one paying the bills (and buying the food)  \nShe called me today morning and asked me to pay her bills. Of course, I refused. Then she wanted me to pay her rent (for what?) in the end, she graciously offered to let us move back, but I refused that too.   \nWell, she went around the family, and of course, they started calling me about it.  everyone wants me to do something.

Your mom made her bed; I'm sure it was hard on your kids living with her. They (and you) deserve a peaceful home. Block her if you have to; you owe her nothing.

She can't afford to live alone in a huge house, and expects others to subsidize her? She can downsize and live within her means, like everyone else has to.

She treated them and you like you were freeloaders and she verbally abused your children. Now she has a reality check. IF you decide to move back in, you should do so with clear boundaries that include respect for you and your children, no guilt crap, and so on. That's a big IF.

She is not a safe environment for your children. Period. She has no business being around them. She should have had the common sense to keep her mouth closed when she wasn't paying her own bills.

Do not move back with her because she's not nice.\n\nYour relatives can all help her, and be sure to tell them that.  Specifically say  \"It\\`s your turn to help her.  If you won't, you certainly can't expect me to pick up YOUR turn.\"\n\nYour mom has to face reality.  The house will have to be sold and she will have to move into government housing.

I lost my only child when he was 14. I was inconsolable and miserable to be around. Not mean or cruel to anyone, just self-absorbed. All I meant was if this wasn't her normal behavior, it's probably anger about her loss. They need to sit down and have a good talk and clear the air. If this IS normal for her, well, that's up to OP to decide"]}
