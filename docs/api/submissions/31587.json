I'd consider the wedding. I was the oldest. \n\nMy siblings came to my high school graduation because basically they were kids and the family was going. So no effort on their part, really, just brought by my family.  However, I did not go any of theirs. Because I was living somewhere else, had no transportation, was broke student and it was my exam week every time. The older siblings often miss graduations, dance recitals, sports games, etc. of younger siblings if they have work/school/living elsewhere.\n\nI did attend their weddings, even when it was distance and not convenient.", "NTA on any front\n\nKudos on having a great, cool job too!!  All the best to you OP", "NTA   Don't make a big deal out of it though, just call and congratulate them as appropriate, rsvp no to the wedding then send a medium-level gift to the bridegroom.   They aren't going to miss you, any fuss will probably come from your parents.   If they try to guilt you, ask them if they put any pressure on your brothers when they ignored your milestones.   Then drop the rope.", "Dog tax!\n\nEdit: NTA. But seriously Dog tax!", "Dogs are the best.

Also, if given the opportunity, your dog would 100% have gone to your graduations.", "Please pay the dog tax.", "Literally makes complete sense. You should give her some Thanksgiving food!", "Also boarding dogs can be dangerous.\n\nETA: we had two that at different times were boarded and had persistent coughs for the rest of their lives. Perhaps anecdotal but still bothered me and we never boarded another one of our babies.", "I am on your side the first (only so far) time I board my dog she went hard depression by day 3. She is also a Covid dog so she has been with me basically 24/7 for a couple of years. I am working on this by having her at day care at least once a week and planning boarding various times when I am near by so she knows I will always come back. It\u2019s expensive but good for emergencies. Don\u2019t worry about your brothers. See my other comment about Dog tax \ud83d\ude02.", "I skip so many events because my dogs are seniors. I didn't mind leaving them with friends when they were younger but now I hate being away from them. \n\nNTA.", "Grace.", "INFO:   \nYou say your brothers didn't come to these graduations personally, but did they at least acknowledge/ congratulate you for it in some other way?  \n(Such as by calling, texting, or even in person during a face-to-face meetup at another time?)\n\nAlso to consider - you mention you were still in high school/ middle school when they had their graduations. So was your going to their events a case of:  \n\"Oh wow, my brothers are graduating, this is an important thing that I want to show my support of, celebrate, and be involved in!\"  \nor was it more a case of your parents saying:  \n\"We're going to your brother's graduation - get in the car.\"  \n  \nBecause it's much easier to be involved in something when you're not really choosing/ making a concentrated effort to go, but are instead just along for the ride.\n\nFor example, I could easily say how I was very supportive of my older brother's sporting endeavours growing up but he wasn't supportive of mine, because I went to every one of his rugby games, but he never attended one of my hockey games.   \nBut that was be disingenuous, because I know that the only reason I went to all of his games was because I was young, and my parents obviously went to watch and just brought me along with them.\n\nObviously every familie's different though - my siblings and I are all super close, and we make efforts to talk and catchup with each other on a regular basis and be there for major life events, no matter where we are in the world. It sounds like you and your brothers haven't been close for a while, which is totally fine.\n\nEither way, you are totally justified in not wanting to accept an invitation and travel to an event, if you don't want to. Particularly if you're not super close with your brothers these days, and it involves taking time off work, travelling, and trying to find boarding options for your dog.   \nJust send a text with \"congrats\" and go out and enjoy the day with your dog!\n\n(Just be mindful, as others have said, that a wedding is a significantly weighter milestone than a graduation, so that one might have run-on effects within your family.)", "You all are making great points, thank you. I agree on the wedding and think I will go. \n\nAlso some more info:\n\n- I definitely would say I went to their graduations because I didn\u2019t really have a choice and tagged along with my parents. Was I still proud of them? Of course. And when it was my time to graduate, they were 22 & 25 (high school) and then 27 and 30 (college). With that said, I understand that it\u2019s different once you aren\u2019t living with your parents because of life. Now it just feels like i\u2019m in that situation, besides I don\u2019t get the guilt free choice because these events are ~more important~.", "First, the situation you describe not unusual. It's normal for a child still at home to attend graduations. \n\nEspecially if they lived away from your hometown, it would be a unusual for them to travel back for your high school and college graduation. \n\nNot going back for medical school graduation --- perfectly normal.\n\nNot going back for a wedding --- that one is going to be noticed. But it's perfectly acceptable. \n\nThose are invitations, not summonses. You're free to decline them and are NTA for that.\n\nWhat I find distasteful about your post is your whole tit-for-tat payback attitude about declining them.", "ESH You went to all those things because you were a child and your parents brought you.  I doubt you had much of a choice whereas those milestones were happening for you while your brothers\u2019s were older and might not be able to drop everything to attend your graduation.  Don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t want to but it sounds more like being in different life phases and ages has more to do with it than anything else.", "The graduation is fine, NTA on that. Weddings are on a completely different level. Not attending BECAUSE he missed your graduation is petty af and is absolutely AH behavior. If you don't want to attend because of distance, finances, whatever, that's a different question. Send a gift if you don't attend, it's the polite thing to do.", "I'm absolutely torn because I'm also the youngest of 3 and my siblings didn't attend my HS or college graduations but I definitely didn't expect them to attend. Don't have med school in this generation but I didn't attend my sibling's law school graduation. A wedding is different though.", "NAH \n\nYou attended because you were young and with your parents. I couldn't imagine caring I'd my siblings attended my high school or college graduation. College graduation is usually super boring, unless you are getting some really special honor. My parents made me go to my university graduation (after the major specific one) and then apologized because it was really boring.\n\n\nBut it sounds like you don't plan on going out of spite. Refusing tongo to the wedding out of spite is really making a statement. You aren't obligated to go, but it will cause a rift in your family. Especially if you have other family there you haven't seen in a long time (which wouldn't be the case at a high school graduation).", "NTA. You get out of a relationship what you put into it. If they never make an effort for you, then you can give them the same energy. The only thing I'd say about the wedding is to go if there will be other family members that you do enjoy and would like to see.", "NTA \n\nThey haven\u2019t made room in their life for you, so why make room in yours for them?  They reaped what they\u2019ve sewn.\n\nBut to echo a previous comment- be prepared for them to skip your future wedding, if that\u2019s part of your life plan.", "NTA \u2014 you get what you put out. They didn\u2019t put out anything, so they don\u2019t get anything. Congrats on getting your dream job and a dog!", "Just don't go then.  If they have problems simply ask where they were for your achievements.     End of story.   Don't go and block any nasty.", "Can you do both on one trip?   If not I\u2019d skip med school and attend the wedding.  Bring the dog and stay in a pet friendly hotel. You\u2019ll see the entire family at the wedding.", "Say you are going, show that you made plans like packing and stuff and then a day before the journey just fake an emergency. Hell, you can give yourself a mild sickness too. \nYou could say your dog got sick but then someone might say \"dog more important than brother\" so I'd avoid that. \n\nProbably best to get food poisoning or something. Or just fake it.", "Yes you are. Awww boo hoo, they never came to\nmine \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22", "NTA. Invitations are just that: invites. They are not summons. Plus, I\u2019m a big fan of meeting energy with the same energy. My siblings decided not to come to my wedding (one even said they were *\u201cfocusing their money on what\u2019s important to them\u201d*), so I meet that energy if I\u2019m even invited to their events.", "YTA if this is how you decide your contribution to relationships.", "NTA. Since you aren't close, evidenced by they not going to either of your graduations, then it shouldn't be an issue. Should either of them say anything about it, let them know you have plans and cannot reschedule. Doggie & Me Spa Day, Doggie & Me Beach Day, Doggie & Me Camping Trip, don't forget the ever important Doggie & Me Birthday!!!", "I think that's a very mature decision, and I commend you for being the bigger person, in regards to attending the wedding.   \n(Although I understand feeling like this as a kind of \"social-etiquette\" hostage situation, on your part).\n\nI also agree that missing the graduation is 100% ok - you're only continuing the precedence setup by your brothers that once you've exited \"forced to go by parents\" age, attending a graduation in-person is a purely optional/ unnecessary brotherly expectation.  \n(But a \"congrats\" text/ call might still be a good idea - not sure if this is something they did for you, but would still be nice, either way). \n\nIt's interesting that you've acknowledged that your attendance at their graduations was more of \"no choice tag along\".  \nWhile I still think an attempt could/ should have been made on your brothers' part to attend your graduation when they were older (depending on distance and other commitments), it's ultimately not really fair to compare the two scenarios in terms of \"having showed more interest/ support\" than them, as your attendance wasn't something that you went out of your way to do in support, but was rather something that was forced/ handed to you.  \nHopefully your brothers were still proud of you, and just due to life/ other obligations, couldn't physically attend your graduation as easily as you could theirs, when you were younger?", "They talk once a year. Sounds like kind of a terrible relationship.", "> that she thinks I\u2019ve abandoned her.\n\nI swear mine thinks that every time I leave the house. I tell her I'll be right back, just going to go to the store, and I still come home to find her moping. I see no difference between her behavior after a 10 hour work day or a 10 minute trip to the store, she is equally happy to see me when I get back. No one has ever loved my with as much devotion as my dogs.", "No, you mentioned it because dogs are loving, faithful and loyal and you can always count on them. That's something you need (we all need) in your life.", "I agree, there does have to be an actual bridge, not just happenstance telephone lines.", "Testify. For what I just spent on the kennel for two weeks the dog could have gone with us. Business class."]}
