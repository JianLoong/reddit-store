Dogs are the best.", "NTA on the college graduation.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d give the wedding some more thought. But an invitation is just that, an invitation, and it\u2019s totally up to you.", "Mixed reaction.  You are fine to not go to the graduation. If you choose not to go to the wedding, that is probably a statement that will have consequences.  If you\u2019re fine with that, then don\u2019t go, but you should be really sure you are all in on burning that bridge.", "NTA, they reap what they sow.", "**NTA** \\- send a gift and congratulations.  Tell them that your dog was ill.", "NTA - you're an adult and you can do whatever you want. If you feel like they aren't involved in your life and events, and you feel like you don't want to be involved in theirs, then by all means go for it and don't take part in their lives.", "NTA. \n\nI do agree that not attending weddings is a different vibe than other life events like graduation, and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to send congrats and a small gift.  \n\nI moved to the west coast from the Midwest and there\u2019s nothing I hate more than wasting money and my limited vacation time going to events for people who are barely on my Christmas card list.  So I don\u2019t go but I\u2019m polite about it. Depending on the relationship I may or may not send a gift. (Didn\u2019t send a gift for my brother\u2019s wedding, I did for a cousin, another cousin got a baby gift for the first baby, no one else did\u2026 I have a huge family.)", "YTA if you don\u2019t go to the wedding that isn\u2019t really comparable to an educational graduation, this is your brother unless you have a really terrible relationship its a bit shitty to not go.

You are under no obligation to attend either event.", "NTA  So happy you got yourself a dog, they are the best.  I would give the wedding couple a gift for their marriage, and just say you could not get the time off.  I may even give the brother graduating a gift, and explain again you could not get time off work.  Then just stop worrying about it.  Have a wonderful life.", "NTA for sure. Your family has shown you their values. You are simply respecting them.", "ESH. They didn\u2019t support you when you were younger so now you won\u2019t support them even if it just means showing up to events", "Definitely you are okay on skipping the graduation.\n\nIf you ever plan to marry and want your brothers there, going to the wedding is a potential investment in your future wrt family.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, you are NTA", "NTA\nFor the graduation. I'd consider the wedding. I was the oldest. \n\nMy siblings came to my high school graduation because basically they were kids and the family was going. So no effort on their part, really, just brought by my family.  However, I did not go any of theirs. Because I was living somewhere else, had no transportation, was broke student and it was my exam week every time. The older siblings often miss graduations, dance recitals, sports games, etc. of younger siblings if they have work/school/living elsewhere.\n\nI did attend their weddings, even when it was distance and not convenient.", "NTA on any front\n\nKudos on having a great, cool job too!!  All the best to you OP", "NTA   Don't make a big deal out of it though, just call and congratulate them as appropriate, rsvp no to the wedding then send a medium-level gift to the bridegroom.   They aren't going to miss you, any fuss will probably come from your parents.   If they try to guilt you, ask them if they put any pressure on your brothers when they ignored your milestones.   Then drop the rope.", "Dog tax!\n\nEdit: NTA. But seriously Dog tax!", "Dogs are the best. I said that because traveling means I would have to board her, which is expensive and I also worry that she thinks I\u2019ve abandoned her. I also just don\u2019t like being away from her.", "If OP had been asked to be in the wedding or if that brother had managed to get to at least one of OP's life events or if OP and this brother spoke more than once a year, then I'd agree. I don't think this is burning a bridge as there doesn't seem to be a bridge to burn.", "Send nothing stay low contact. If they never sent stuff to you why appease selfish people.", "Dogs are awesome! I say skip the graduation and wedding! Take doggie out both those days and post pics of everything you do! Have fun and live your best life!!", "Right on. There are times where I've spent more to board my dog than I do for airfare or hotel when I go on a trip. Also, if given the opportunity, your dog would 100% have gone to your graduations.", "Please pay the dog tax.", "Literally makes complete sense. You should give her some Thanksgiving food!", "Also boarding dogs can be dangerous.\n\nETA: we had two that at different times were boarded and had persistent coughs for the rest of their lives. Perhaps anecdotal but still bothered me and we never boarded another one of our babies.", "I am on your side the first (only so far) time I board my dog she went hard depression by day 3. She is also a Covid dog so she has been with me basically 24/7 for a couple of years. I am working on this by having her at day care at least once a week and planning boarding various times when I am near by so she knows I will always come back. It\u2019s expensive but good for emergencies. Don\u2019t worry about your brothers. See my other comment about Dog tax \ud83d\ude02.", "I skip so many events because my dogs are seniors. I didn't mind leaving them with friends when they were younger but now I hate being away from them. \n\nNTA.", "Grace."]}
