I had to do the same thing to my half-siblings last year and it was not fun for any of us.\n\nI feel for the children, of course, because they are not to blame for the awkward situation so it is a shame that they are upset, but I don\u2019t see any justifiable reason why you should subject yourself to an unhealthy environment for them.\n\nYou could keep caving and going back to see them, but that\u2019s really only delaying the inevitable and prolonging the hurt.\n\nHowever - and this depends on more variables than you\u2019ve shared - if your father and stepmother are really problematic, chances are the kids will realise this as they\u2019re older and want out just like you did, and it may be good to try to maintain some relationship with them, if you can bear it, so they have outside support if they ever also want to leave. Also, while I don\u2019t think this should be your responsibility, I fear for the resentment that may build because of their sister effectively abandoning them. (I say this with the utmost sympathy, of course, but I imagine that\u2019s basically how they view it.) Just food for thought.", "NTA.\n\nKids that age rarely initiate that kind of request or badgering about it.  Their parents are likely fueling their demands.   It's about control by their parents. \n\nTheir feelings are not your responsibility.   \n\nAn adult sibling not attending a holiday event with relatives  is hardly unusual.", "NTA It feels to me like the parents are manipulating them to make it into a bigger deal than it is. Telling them they don't love you if you don't go etc. \n\nIf you go they will be used to manipulate you every time the parents want you to do something you don't want to do.\n\nYes I feel sorry for the kids but in the long run you will be showing the parents they can't use their kids as tools to manipulate you which will benefit them in future.\n\nI would go to your siblings as planned.", "Look it is your choice what you do. However, let me offer a perspective to you. Those kids are innocent and they love you. They only know you as a sibling. If you have any ounce of care for them, even a little bit, consider seeing them for 1 day, and one day only. I think you\u2019ll regret burning a bridge with them. \n\nAs much as you don\u2019t like your dad and step-mom, they will probably feel the same as they grow up. You could be a pillar for them. \n\nAgain, it is your choice. NTA\n\nI feel for those kids though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it was easier for them to cut him out while minors because mom was alive. They were with a parent.\n\nI never did love my half siblings. In my head I never thought of them when counting my family or number of siblings.", "Wow that is rough, you were placed in an impossible situation. Damned if you do damned if you don't.  While I agree with the original comment, fhe kids are innocent, I worry they were motivated to reach out to you and idolize you by one of their parents.  It's not uncommon for estranged parents to try to guilt their family together. \n\nIt may be beneficial to touch base with these kids when they're older and can appreciate the complexity of yours and your fathers relationship.  That way you can explain that your leaving was never about them, it was the goal before they were born.\n\nFor now, if you can't spend time with them without taking down your boundaries for your dad then don't go. NTA", "NTA - It\u2019s not your job to make children feel safe and secure. That\u2019s the parents job.", "NTA it's very unusual for kids to question how much somebody loves them based on their actions- I think that idea was put in their heads.\n\nI was in a really bad situation when I was 18, spent Xmas with my dad who was really fucking up, and it wasn't a safe place for me. I'm still traumatised by the chaos and neglect that went on that Xmas. Not to say it would be that bad but I would advise you at your age to stay as emotionally safe as you can and to spend time with people who support you (actively) to be you. I hope you can spend time with just the kids some times but as has happened to me that could become toxic if parents are willing to put bad opinions in their heads. It's quite upsetting when you hear kids getting older and starting to believe the shit they are told.", "NTA. Just your dad's response to that would be reason enough not to come home. He sounds manipulative and demanding.", "Nta", "That's a choice you made.  You chose not to love them from the very beginning.  I feel sorry for you, and sorry for them.  This could have been an enriching part of your life, but you turned your back on them.", "If all the kids couldn't stand the dad after the divorce there's a reason. As OP was also a child at the time, we don't know how the dad and stepmom treated OP vs. the newer kids.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou are not the cause of their upset. That falls entirely on their parents and their persistance that you must do as you are told for the sake of their family image.\n\nMost kids would have understood amd moved their focus on to something else", "NTA if they call again just say \"Ask your father\" and hang up.", "NTA\n\nYou go where you feel comfortable.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine not accept abuse just to cater to their kids.", "NTA, given their ages, I highly doubt that they initiated that contact. Like there were people behind them getting them hyped to do this. \n\nYeah you didn't say it plainly enough that their mother and father are villains and that's why you didn't want to see them at christmas, but the only reason this issue occurred is because of your father and his wife", "Nta", "This!\n\nKids those ages don't use that kind of phrasing without adult prompting.  Either Dad and Stepmom want to assert control and/or Dad and Stepmom have plans and want a free sitter.\n\nOP, your Dad has proven that he'll use your siblings to manipulate you.  Block all of their numbers.", "NTA The kids need to get used to the idea that you aren't going to be around much. Start your adult life as you mean to go on. I think it would be worse to falsely encourage a close relationship that you would be unable to maintain for the next 10-15 years.  I would continue to take calls perhaps cut them shorter over time and kind of drift till you feel comfortable.\n\n My oldest brother was 12 years older than me and he had his own life, he joined the military at 18. Got married had kids. He kept in contact with Mom, but I didn't have much to do with him until I was an adult myself. Other than saying Hi as a child on the phone, we didn't talk I don't think. It doesn't have to be weird. The kids have each other and should be busy fighting, and playing with each other.", "nta next time they call thats not them you dont like its their parents", "NTA", "NTA however, would it possible to pick up just the young ones so you can still spend 1 on 1 time with them as a compromise?", "OP doesn't want a relationship with them. Plus a relationship with minors means contact with the parents which OP really doesn't want. It's ok for the kids to just not have OP there for Christmas, no compromise needed.", "Oh. I must have missed the point where he said that. My apologies", "No need to apologize, I didn't downvote you. I was just giving a different perspective.", "And what does that have to do with rejecting their innocent half-siblings from the moment of their birth?", "Probably didn't want to get involved knowing they'd be weaponized when OP left. And look at that! They are!", "Not enough info.\n\nWhy are you all estranged from him?", "Absolutely. OP\u2019s full siblings cut off their dad. It isn\u2019t a choice made lightly or without reasons. As OP is the youngest of the three and was forced to live with her dad it was his chance to keep one of his first three kids in his life. Sounds like he did it by trying to force OP to bond with the little ones, and little ones are easy to manipulate. \n\nIt\u2019s sad for all five kids. It still isn\u2019t on OP to be in contact with them. If the little kids are hurting that is due to the lies their parents are telling them. Awful all around. \n\nNTA and OP, if you see this? Write the kids letters but do not send them. Save the letters so one day if they are adults and contact you they can see why you\u2019ve chosen what you have. It may help with the guilty feelings you are having right now that are not your fault.", "NTA. But, OP, I have kids around this age. I think you need to call them and say, \"I care about you a lot, but I'm going out in the world and learning to be an adult, which is a lot of hard work, so I need to focus on that. You just focus on being the awesome kids you are. And just know, me not coming around doesn't have anything to do with you, and everything to do with me being an adult and focusing on figuring all of that out.\"\n\nI have a STRONG feeling your dad or stepmom are trying to manipulate you through the kids, so just lay it all out, but in an age-appropriate way.", "It's appreciated.  Truly.", "[removed]", "On a lot of posts on here I see comments they aren't my real siblings, they are half siblings. \n\nHalf siblings are real siblings. \n\nHalf siblings, step siblings, full siblings.

I am so happy you ended the call with your father. Too many people allow harassing calls to go on, and I want them to have the courage you have to just hang up.", ">This led to them asking why I didn't love them enough to see them for Christmas. \n\nI would bet money this is a coached response that your dad told them to say. I'm so sorry OP, going NC with family is a very tough decision (one I've made myself). You are NTA one little bit. Keep your boundaries and if you don't want to keep contact with those kids, it's best to just do that now. You said you never bonded with them, they are still young and while it will suck for a bit, in the long run, it might be better just to cut all ties.", "Nta block or get a new number and don't tell them.", "NTA.  I mean no disrespect because you are absolutely worthy of love and inclusion. This just sounds as if your father and his wife want free babysitting.  My condolences on the loss of your mother.  I hope you and your older siblings have a memorable holiday.", "You sound like the stepmom...or maybe the dad?", "Doing that means OP has to have contact with what sounds like an incredibly toxic set of adults since the kids are minors. OP is allowed to stay away from them and not have to deal with that drama and have no guilt about it.", "[removed]", "I mean, I guess you are lucky you older siblings didn\u2019t reject you like you are rejecting your younger siblings.", "I think you can tell them the truth, that you and their parents don't get along. Just because we imagine something would be really fun and happy doesn't mean it actually would be. They don't like when mom and dad fight, right, so they wouldn't like it when mom or dad fought with you either. Not going prevents fights so everyone can be happier.", "INFO are you able to explain why you and your siblings are estranged from your dad and stepmother? Did they force you to spend time with the little kids or try and erase your mom?", "NTA. You have to protect yourself. However, is it possible to see them at a playground or something for a little while, without seeing your father? That would be great. \n\nChildren would not come up with \"you don't love me enough\" on their own. They are being fed lines.", "NTA.

You had your older siblings to help you; who do these little guys have?\n\nBut still, NTA", ">I like this(phone call).    \n>  \n>I understand OP doesn't feel great affection for them, but she says they adore her, so I can see them missing her naturally--the guilt-tripping phone calls etc most likely parent-induced.  \n>  \n>Unstated is if the father and SM were parentifying OP by making her care for them.    \n>  \n>I also liked the writing (unsent) letters idea(above).", "NTA. These kids and their needs are not your responsibility. Your mental and emotional wellbeing is. It may seem cruel but you should probably cut contact with the kids as all the while they have access to you, so does your father. If you have genuine concerns for the kids ask CPS to investigate.", "NTA \n\nThe parents are putting them up to the phone calls. The kids probably did ask initially if you were coming and then they were coached into the call. Despicable behavior on the adult side", "NTA. Your father knows perfectly well why you (and your two full siblings) want nothing to do with him.", "NTA, you need what\u2019s right for you. Given there is definitely something your dad and how he treated and made effort with older siblings. There\u2019s is always a good reason people go no contact with parents.\n\nThis is your choice, and your father has to accept your choice, if he wants to improve relationships with you, then he need to understand and accept what has lead to this situation and take action to attempt to build a relations but only if you and your sibling want this.\n\nUsing emotional blackmail just makes the situation worse. I get where your younger sibling may miss you, but how you feel about your connection is important. You not trying to hurt them, but you sound like you don\u2019t have same connection them.\n\nGood luck for the future and enjoy Christmas your way. Don\u2019t let your dad pull you down or doubt your decision", "NTA. Stand for yourself. You are too young to help your stepbrothers", "YTA for you to talk about how much your brother and sister supported each other and were able to move in with your sister, and to then cut your younger siblings off completely. Wild jump to me your leaving two young kids in a obviously shitty situation with no support. Your a def the AH and a bad sister", "Hopefully dad will have some self reflection and think about why his 3 children want nothing to do with him and be a better parent for the little ones.\nOP, NTA in any way."]}
