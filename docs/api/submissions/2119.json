I had to do the same thing to my half-siblings last year and it was not fun for any of us.\n\nI feel for the children, of course, because they are not to blame for the awkward situation so it is a shame that they are upset, but I don\u2019t see any justifiable reason why you should subject yourself to an unhealthy environment for them.\n\nYou could keep caving and going back to see them, but that\u2019s really only delaying the inevitable and prolonging the hurt.\n\nHowever - and this depends on more variables than you\u2019ve shared - if your father and stepmother are really problematic, chances are the kids will realise this as they\u2019re older and want out just like you did, and it may be good to try to maintain some relationship with them, if you can bear it, so they have outside support if they ever also want to leave. Also, while I don\u2019t think this should be your responsibility, I fear for the resentment that may build because of their sister effectively abandoning them. (I say this with the utmost sympathy, of course, but I imagine that\u2019s basically how they view it.) Just food for thought.", "NTA.\n\nKids that age rarely initiate that kind of request or badgering about it.  Their parents are likely fueling their demands.   It's about control by their parents. \n\nTheir feelings are not your responsibility.   \n\nAn adult sibling not attending a holiday event with relatives  is hardly unusual.", "NTA It feels to me like the parents are manipulating them to make it into a bigger deal than it is. Telling them they don't love you if you don't go etc. \n\nIf you go they will be used to manipulate you every time the parents want you to do something you don't want to do.\n\nYes I feel sorry for the kids but in the long run you will be showing the parents they can't use their kids as tools to manipulate you which will benefit them in future.\n\nI would go to your siblings as planned.", "Look it is your choice what you do. However, let me offer a perspective to you. Those kids are innocent and they love you. They only know you as a sibling. If you have any ounce of care for them, even a little bit, consider seeing them for 1 day, and one day only. I think you\u2019ll regret burning a bridge with them. \n\nAs much as you don\u2019t like your dad and step-mom, they will probably feel the same as they grow up. You could be a pillar for them. \n\nAgain, it is your choice. NTA\n\nI feel for those kids though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it was easier for them to cut him out while minors because mom was alive. They were with a parent.\n\nI never did love my half siblings. In my head I never thought of them when counting my family or number of siblings.", "Wow that is rough, you were placed in an impossible situation. Damned if you do damned if you don't.  While I agree with the original comment, fhe kids are innocent, I worry they were motivated to reach out to you and idolize you by one of their parents.  It's not uncommon for estranged parents to try to guilt their family together. \n\nIt may be beneficial to touch base with these kids when they're older and can appreciate the complexity of yours and your fathers relationship.  That way you can explain that your leaving was never about them, it was the goal before they were born.\n\nFor now, if you can't spend time with them without taking down your boundaries for your dad then don't go. NTA", "NTA - It\u2019s not your job to make children feel safe and secure. That\u2019s the parents job.", "NTA it's very unusual for kids to question how much somebody loves them based on their actions- I think that idea was put in their heads.\n\nI was in a really bad situation when I was 18, spent Xmas with my dad who was really fucking up, and it wasn't a safe place for me. I'm still traumatised by the chaos and neglect that went on that Xmas. Not to say it would be that bad but I would advise you at your age to stay as emotionally safe as you can and to spend time with people who support you (actively) to be you. I hope you can spend time with just the kids some times but as has happened to me that could become toxic if parents are willing to put bad opinions in their heads. It's quite upsetting when you hear kids getting older and starting to believe the shit they are told.", "NTA. Just your dad's response to that would be reason enough not to come home. He sounds manipulative and demanding.", "Nta", "That's a choice you made.  You chose not to love them from the very beginning.  I feel sorry for you, and sorry for them.  This could have been an enriching part of your life, but you turned your back on them.", "If all the kids couldn't stand the dad after the divorce there's a reason. As OP was also a child at the time, we don't know how the dad and stepmom treated OP vs. the newer kids.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou are not the cause of their upset. That falls entirely on their parents and their persistance that you must do as you are told for the sake of their family image.\n\nMost kids would have understood amd moved their focus on to something else", "NTA if they call again just say \"Ask your father\" and hang up.", "NTA\n\nYou go where you feel comfortable.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine not accept abuse just to cater to their kids.", "NTA, given their ages, I highly doubt that they initiated that contact. Like there were people behind them getting them hyped to do this. \n\nYeah you didn't say it plainly enough that their mother and father are villains and that's why you didn't want to see them at christmas, but the only reason this issue occurred is because of your father and his wife", "Nta", "This!\n\nKids those ages don't use that kind of phrasing without adult prompting.  Either Dad and Stepmom want to assert control and/or Dad and Stepmom have plans and want a free sitter.\n\nOP, your Dad has proven that he'll use your siblings to manipulate you.  Block all of their numbers."]}
