We and one other table that was about to leave were the only tables at the restaurant. A few seconds after we sat down, before we were able to look at the menu, the server came in and asked what we wanted to drink. We both ordered water. When she dropped off the water, she slammed it on the table and just walked away. A few minutes later, she came by to take our orders. She came over and dropped our drinks. My wife said \u201cthank you\u201d and the waitress said \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d as she walked away immediately. \n\nWhen our food was ready, another server delivered our food. As we were enjoying our food, my wife wanted a honey mustard sauce for her sweet potato fries, but the waitress was nowhere to be seen. She walked by our table once, but she was just staring down at her phone and did not pay attention to our table even though we were looking at her as if we needed something (we both had burgers in our hands and mouths, so we couldn\u2019t say anything). She walked into the kitchen while looking down at her phone and scrolling through her photo gallery.\n\nWe never saw the waitress again until my wife went up to the bar and asked for honey mustard from a bartender after 15 minutes of waiting. The bartender went into the kitchen and told us that the server would be out with the honey mustard. After waiting about 3-4 minutes, she came out with the honey mustard and literally dropped it off (she did not gently place it), and briskly walked right off into the kitchen without asking if we needed anything else. My wife said \u201cthank you,\u201d but the waitress didn\u2019t say anything as she walked away.\n\nWhen we finished our meals, we saw her come to our table with the Toast handheld point-of-sale machine to insert my credit card. The total came out to $54.11. For tips, I pressed no tips.\n\nWhen my wife and I were walking back to the car, she asked how much I tipped. I said 0. She was very frustrated at me and said that she could no longer go out to dinner with me and she could never go back here again cause I gave no tips. She said 8-10% would be justifiable, but 0% is not acceptable. I justified my zero-dollar tip by telling her how the waitress did not check on our table once and how she just dropped things and walked right off into the kitchen to never be seen again.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: The restaurant closes at midnight. The kitchen closes at 11 pm.\nI have never not tipped before.

Still, if you're so disappointed with the service, it's actually fair that you don't feel like tipping. Even if the waitress has a bad day, you still deserve to have a nice experience, considering you're spending your money at that place. So, once again NTA.\n\nYet two questions remain. Your wife said she wouldn't go out with you again and was frustrated with your behaviour, which makes me wonder two things. 1.

Finally order is in, food comes delivered by a different staff member, not one drink refill or check on us to see how everything was till dropping off a bill.

Why should I?      \n\n   And everyone has the same excuse,  COVID.\n\n  A tip is supposed to be a thank you for good service not just forced payment from the customer. Some places are automatically adding minimum tips to the bill, along with odd fees for employees benefits and funds.  \n\n\nDefinition of tip: If you tip someone such as a waiter in a restaurant, you give them some money in order to thank them for their services.

We and one other table that was about to leave were the only tables at the restaurant. A few seconds after we sat down, before we were able to look at the menu, the server came in and asked what we wanted to drink. We both ordered water. When she dropped off the water, she slammed it on the table and just walked away. A few minutes later, she came by to take our orders. She came over and dropped our drinks. My wife said \u201cthank you\u201d and the waitress said \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d as she walked away immediately. \n\nWhen our food was ready, another server delivered our food. As we were enjoying our food, my wife wanted a honey mustard sauce for her sweet potato fries, but the waitress was nowhere to be seen. She walked by our table once, but she was just staring down at her phone and did not pay attention to our table even though we were looking at her as if we needed something (we both had burgers in our hands and mouths, so we couldn\u2019t say anything). She walked into the kitchen while looking down at her phone and scrolling through her photo gallery.\n\nWe never saw the waitress again until my wife went up to the bar and asked for honey mustard from a bartender after 15 minutes of waiting. The bartender went into the kitchen and told us that the server would be out with the honey mustard. After waiting about 3-4 minutes, she came out with the honey mustard and literally dropped it off (she did not gently place it), and briskly walked right off into the kitchen without asking if we needed anything else. My wife said \u201cthank you,\u201d but the waitress didn\u2019t say anything as she walked away.\n\nWhen we finished our meals, we saw her come to our table with the Toast handheld point-of-sale machine to insert my credit card. The total came out to $54.11. For tips, I pressed no tips.\n\nWhen my wife and I were walking back to the car, she asked how much I tipped. I said 0. She was very frustrated at me and said that she could no longer go out to dinner with me and she could never go back here again cause I gave no tips. She said 8-10% would be justifiable, but 0% is not acceptable. I justified my zero-dollar tip by telling her how the waitress did not check on our table once and how she just dropped things and walked right off into the kitchen to never be seen again.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My wife and I recently had a dining experience at a local restaurant, and it was one for the books\u2014but not in a good way.\r  \n\r  \nWe were excited to try this place known for its diverse menu, and we ordered a variety of dishes to get a feel for their offerings.

My rationale was that tipping is a way to reward good service, and in this case, the service was far from satisfactory. My wife, however, felt differently. She suggested that perhaps the server was having a rough day or that there were factors we weren't aware of.\r  \n\r  \nI get it\u2014I've worked in customer service before, and I know everyone has off days.

You have a few nights with some exceptional tippers? You can bet they are going to stretch that as far as they can to off set the bad days.

There's plenty of issues preventing the switch, but this is what I'd say is the biggest problem. The system of \"get paid by tips\" is already in place, so doing what you suggest would require re-building the entire system. That type of switch is costly and time consuming. Individual restaurants can make the decision to change, but to change the general population's expectations would require getting hundreds of thousands of restaurants to change, which is unreasonable. The only thing that would really motivate that type of widespread change would be legislation that severely penalized places that didn't update in some designated time frame.\n\nAdditionally, with the current system, individual servers are more motivated to provide good service. I've worked in a couple places that pooled their tips and it felt useless to push for extra good service. If my efforts brought in an extra $10, I would see less than $1 of it. Keeping my own personal tips encouraged me to give better service to my own tables.
