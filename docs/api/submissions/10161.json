{"id": 10161, "submission_id": "1148znt", "title": "AITA for making a driver give me his insurance after he hit my car?", "selftext": "I was driving home from practice today. My sister was in the passenger seat. I was in a rush to get home. While I was driving I was in the middle lane out of 3. A person in the lane to my right was trying to switch lanes in front of me and I wasn\u2019t letting them. They had been driving slow and I didn\u2019t feel like letting them in because I was going faster, but their lane was close to ending and when it did they\u2019d have to make a turn. There was no car directly behind me, if they wanted to they could have slowed down even more and switched lanes behind me. They didn\u2019t want to do that but we\u2019re getting impatient since I wasn\u2019t letting them in, so they decided to switch lanes anyways and try to scare me into letting them in, even though they knew I was beside them. I didn\u2019t budge and they swiped the side of my car and went back to their lane.\n\nI slowed down and told my sister to take a picture of their license plate. I rolled down the window and had her signal the driver to pull over. They pulled over and I told them to give me their insurance. They had scratched up the right side of my car pretty good, as well as the left side of their own car. The driver told me that they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the cost of their insurance rate increasing from the accident and asked me to let it go. I told them I wasn\u2019t going to let it go and that if they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for the damages they shouldn\u2019t have caused them. They gave me their insurance info, but they called me a heartless asshole and said I should have just let them switch lanes. I think I\u2019m in the right and that it\u2019s their fault for recklessly trying to force me to yield, but my sister thinks I should have just let them change lanes and that I shouldn\u2019t have taken their insurance since my parents can afford to pay the damages, although they would be pissed about it. I told her the driver could have been lying to get out of paying and that they brought it on themselves. We argued over it while I finished the drive home. The argument has stuck with me through the night, so I wanted to ask here. So let me know, AITA?\n\nEdit: I saw someone bring it up so I just wanted to clarify, when I say I had them give me their insurance I mean that I went through the normal process for after a crash in order to have insurance handle it. In my state you exchange insurance, license, and call the cops. I answered questions from the authorities and gave them my insurance. I let them handle the other driver once they arrived. The process went relatively quickly and I drove home when they said I could. I shortened it for the post, but I realize it\u2019s probably good to clarify this for anyone who is worried about if I went through the proper process.", "created_utc": 1676603021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1148znt/aita_for_making_a_driver_give_me_his_insurance/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The speed limit was 45, I was going 48 and they were going under 40.\n\nSo you were speeding and you purposely didn't let them merge when they were ahead of you. You are like 75% at fault here. Driving is a privilege, not a constitutional right. You get your drivers license based on the skills you have and the rules you agree to follow. \n\nIf the guy decides to go to court, I expect it to go in their favor not yours.", "So there was a zipper merge, and they were ahead of you?  \n\nWhere I live your actions were illegal.", "and people like you are why where I am from merging has no right of way. Too many idiots lane hogging and blocking. Merging is a shared responsibility. YTA. Grow up before you kill someone who isnt you. \n\nEven if you did have the right away, graveyards are full of people who had the right of way. You could have killed your sister.", "OP accelerated to prevent the other car from overtaking. OP is definitely the asshole", "I think this might be the other dude lol either way, it's definitely someone who doesn't understand how the road rules work.", "\"bUt ThE oThEr DrIvEr!!\"\n\nNo,  op knew; acknowledged and admitted that the other car needed to get over and HE PURPOSELY DID NOT LET THEM IN.  He knew; acknowledged and admitted that HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A 3 LANE ROAD.  Op couldve moved the fuck over.\nInstead he put his sister's life in danger.  That. Right there.  Is why.  Op is an asshole. He put other people in danger because he didn't want to be inconvienced by a few minutes.. instead of doing the right thing and moving over ; speeding up, or slowing down and letting them in.  !!!!HE!!!PURPOSELY!!!! BLOCKED THEM!!!!!. He didn't even same time with his idiocy! He wasted time!!!\n\n\n\nYou defending him only outs yourself as another road raging asshole driver.", "But if he just lets the car merge than OP isnt in this situation, so who\u2019s really the winner here? Let the turtle in and get home in one piece. Who gives af who\u2019s right and wrong", "Both drivers were assholes, granted, but if OP says he \"didn't let the other car in\", that implies that the other car was ahead of him. OP also mentioned that the other car was driving slowly. OP likely tried to pass the other slower moving car.", "Your comment doesn't even remotely make sense.", "Right, left side was the fast lane. People were easily passing me. Most people were going well over 50 to my left.", "I go the speed of traffic in the lane, but yes I generally just stay in one lane. For most of my drive it\u2019s 2 lanes, then it splits off to 3 for a little bit, then it goes back to 2 lane. The 3rd lane is for a turn at a light that goes onto the highway, a turn to a church, and then the turn to the shopping center. It doesn\u2019t last long.", "Totally wrong, they would not be at fault at all. It\u2019s 100% the fault of the person who switched lanes into them. \n\nThe other person proved that they did not have the skills and did not follow the rules. It is wrong to slam on your breaks to let someone in. When you are switching lanes, you yield to the traffic. It is not the other way around.", "Not a zipper merge. It was a turn lane the people were trying to get out of.", "It isn\u2019t a zipper merge. A zipper merge is when a lane is closed due to construction and cars use both lanes until they reach the construction, where 1 lane is the cut off by cones or some other obstruction and you alternate lanes to enter.", "No, OP said he was already passing them. He didn\u2019t speed up, he maintained speed. The other driver (the one required by law to yield) refused to slow down.", "If the car had slowed down, and merged when safe, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.", "Maybe you should try improving your reading comprehension then.", "That is actually False. \n\nMost of the time they wouldn't be at fault BUT they admitted that:\n\nA. They were speeding\n\nB. They wanted to prevent the other car from merging\n\nC. The other car was in front of them about to merge \n\nD. OP knew it was dangerous\n\nWith this information, they are more than half at fault. They weren't being a responsible driver. They could've caused a bigger accident.", "\u201cThe person trying to change lanes was to my side and I was in the process of passing when they signaled to switch lanes because they saw the turn was coming up. The front half of my car was lined up with the back half of their car by the time they tried to force me to slow down and let them into the lane.\u201d\n\nSo OP is speeding, sees someone signaling to get over (due to a lane ending), makes no accommodations to allow them in, then once they see they are actually executing the lane change still does not try and avoid a collision. He stood his ground.\n\nThis is stupid driving, not defensive driving. The driver in the right lane made a mistake too no question about it, but it was an avoidable accident regardless.", "Op said he was speeding up to pass the other car before the merge was coming.", "Clearly the other driver didn\u2019t exhibit the kind of rationality you\u2019re talking about. When you\u2019re driving and see someone else driving crazy,  doing what you need to do to get home safe supercedes right and wrong", "A. The other car was going 10 under. That is also illegal and much more dangerous than going 3 over the speed limit. The other driver would definitely be at fault here. \n\nB/C. And the other car wanted to prevent OP from getting in front of them. There were no other cars behind OP, so it would have been much safer for the other driver to get behind them. Especially as OP says he was more beside them than behind them when they wanted over. \n\nD. The other driver must have known that playing chicken and forcing his way in was dangerous. \n\nYou cannot convince me that OP is at fault. Could he have gotten over? Yeah absolutely. That\u2019s probably what I would have done. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s not his fault at all.", "It doesn't matter that OP was doing 3 over the speed limit, and LOL at you for implying they were going too fast for the other driver to react. \n\nA turn signal isn't a Fremen crysknife from Dune that can't be sheathed until it's used. If you turn on your signal and then look to see a) a car is right there in the other lane and b) there's a huge gap behind them, you are 100% the asshole for forcing a merge--and if you didn't see them you are insufficiently attentive to be operating a motor vehicle. All this both sides caterwauling does nothing but enable the asshole drivers that think everyone else is obligated to get out of their way.", "No, he said he was going faster than them to begin with. It reads to me as if he just maintained speed.", "I hate other drivers. But I probably fall into that category from time to time. I\u2019m trying to be better lol", "OP intentionally did not let the other driver in with a lane ending situation. They are very clearly an asshole. OP even says the other driver was frustrated because they weren\u2019t letting them in, which means OP was persistent about blocking.\n\nThe right lane made an error because they changed lanes into a side swipe. There is no scenario that they are not accountable for that. \n\nNonetheless, defensive driving is good driving, everything else is asshole driving.", "Read the first part of the post again:\n\n\"person in the lane to my right was trying to switch lanes in front of me\"\n\nAlso if OP was going faster then how did the other car get in front of them?", "Lol i hear you. Where I live and work there are sooo many shitty drivers. And if I wanted to stand my ground and be right I\u2019d probably have a few totaled cars on my hands lol", "And also, that doesn\u2019t say anything about what we were discussing, which was that OP did not speed up. And just to clarify, there was NO MERGE coming up. Their lane was a turn lane, not a merge point.", "Read the comments. \n\n\u201c The person trying to change lanes was to my side and I was in the process of passing when they signaled to switch lanes because they saw the turn was coming up. The front half of my car was lined up with the back half of their car by the time they tried to force me to slow down and let them into the lane. \u201d", "The other car was still ahead of OP. Op decided to risk his sister's life by speeding up. Also I doubt the other car was going 30. Probably around 40 because they managed to stay in front of OP all that time when they sped up to merge. \n\nIf there are traffic cameras near that merger, then it would be easier to see what the hell actually happened. A car going 48 vs a car going 30. You'd expect the car going 30 to be passed up quickly even if they sped up.", "I\u2019d guess the other car was somewhere between 35-40. I was driving a consistent speed, just the general flow of traffic in my area. On this road most people go a few miles over and I find it better to stick to that rule than directly follow the 45MPH limit. I got honked at and tailgated multiple times when I was first starting to drive for going the exact limit. Cops almost never pull you over in my area unless you go 5 over so I usually go 2-3 over, as does almost everyone else. Also it wasn\u2019t a merger, they had been cruising in a turn lane without realizing and were trying to change lanes at the last minute. They only turned on their signal as I was in the process of passing them."]}
