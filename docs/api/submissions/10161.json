{"id": 10161, "submission_id": "1148znt", "title": "AITA for making a driver give me his insurance after he hit my car?", "selftext": "I was driving home from practice today. My sister was in the passenger seat. I was in a rush to get home. While I was driving I was in the middle lane out of 3. A person in the lane to my right was trying to switch lanes in front of me and I wasn\u2019t letting them. They had been driving slow and I didn\u2019t feel like letting them in because I was going faster, but their lane was close to ending and when it did they\u2019d have to make a turn. There was no car directly behind me, if they wanted to they could have slowed down even more and switched lanes behind me. They didn\u2019t want to do that but we\u2019re getting impatient since I wasn\u2019t letting them in, so they decided to switch lanes anyways and try to scare me into letting them in, even though they knew I was beside them. I didn\u2019t budge and they swiped the side of my car and went back to their lane.\n\nI slowed down and told my sister to take a picture of their license plate. I rolled down the window and had her signal the driver to pull over. They pulled over and I told them to give me their insurance. They had scratched up the right side of my car pretty good, as well as the left side of their own car. The driver told me that they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the cost of their insurance rate increasing from the accident and asked me to let it go. I told them I wasn\u2019t going to let it go and that if they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for the damages they shouldn\u2019t have caused them. They gave me their insurance info, but they called me a heartless asshole and said I should have just let them switch lanes. I think I\u2019m in the right and that it\u2019s their fault for recklessly trying to force me to yield, but my sister thinks I should have just let them change lanes and that I shouldn\u2019t have taken their insurance since my parents can afford to pay the damages, although they would be pissed about it. I told her the driver could have been lying to get out of paying and that they brought it on themselves. We argued over it while I finished the drive home. The argument has stuck with me through the night, so I wanted to ask here. So let me know, AITA?\n\nEdit: I saw someone bring it up so I just wanted to clarify, when I say I had them give me their insurance I mean that I went through the normal process for after a crash in order to have insurance handle it. In my state you exchange insurance, license, and call the cops. I answered questions from the authorities and gave them my insurance. I let them handle the other driver once they arrived. The process went relatively quickly and I drove home when they said I could. I shortened it for the post, but I realize it\u2019s probably good to clarify this for anyone who is worried about if I went through the proper process.\n\nEdit 2: Seen people bring this up so I want to clarify it here, the other car was in a turn lane not a zipper merge. At the end of the lane you have to make a right turn into a shopping center. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve also seen people be confused by my poor phrasing of some things so I\u2019ll try to be more clear about the situation. I was going at a consistent speed of 48 MPH, the speed limit is 45. People in my area honk and tailgate if you go the speed limit, it\u2019s normal to go 2-3 over. Cops in my area don\u2019t care unless you\u2019re going 5 or more over, so it\u2019s typically safer to speed slightly. To my left was the fast lane, where there were cars going well over 50 and I remember being easily passed many times. To my right was the turn only lane. The right lane doesn\u2019t last long. Most of my drive home is 2 lanes, then it splits into 3 for a short time. The 3rd lane is mostly used for people who want to make turns, although some people also use it as a way to go slower. It first begins a little bit before it gives the opportunity to turn onto the highway, then it turns to a church, finally it turns to the shopping center and then goes back to 2 lanes. I usually stay in the right lane because the turn to get to my neighborhood and house is from the right lane, is it\u2019s easiest to stay in this one lane the whole drive. The person in the turn only lane was going somewhere between 35-40 MPH and must not have realized it was turn only. I was in the process of passing them when they turned on their turn signal. The front half of my car was aligned with the back half of their car. I hope that I have cleared up some questions.", "created_utc": 1676603021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1148znt/aita_for_making_a_driver_give_me_his_insurance/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the vast majority of people on the road imo. Unfortunately, not all people are like that. If you merging is going to cause other people to have to react to you in some extreme way (slamming brakes, swerving, honking, etc.) you can\u2019t safely merge and shouldn\u2019t be trying to. I\u2019d say about 5% of people I run into on the road are like this. \n\nI drive on the interstate/other high-traffic fast-paced roads almost every day and see this bullshit all the time. OP word of advice: don\u2019t cruise in the right lane because you can\u2019t. People will always merge on over into you, and get mad because they feel they always have the right of way on the road, even though they don\u2019t.", "YTA they were driving the speed limit, you were intentionally driving over effectively preventing their movement.

Definitely not for asking for insurance. That is what the system is for. You and your family should not have to pay out of pocket when you pay insurance for that very thing. And your insurance will want to go after their insurance. This is all normal, and above board. It\u2019s how it is done, and their premium increase because of their actions is their own problem. \n\nBut the road is not a contest. It isn\u2019t all about winning out over the next guy. There are rules, patterns, and courtesies that are necessary to keep people safe. He put his blinker on as soon as he noticed the turn lane, and while he was still ahead of you. The kind, correct, snd polite thing to do is to let him in. The fact that you sped up to prevent someone who is just trying to go about their day from doing what they needed to do is an AH move. Forcing them to slow way down to get in behind you is inviting other accidents to happen. \n\nIn the situation as you described it, the correct move was to drop back a couple MPH and let them in. If they didn\u2019t go fast enough, you had a fast lane to go around them. You also could have shifted left into the fast lane for a moment, instead of slowing down. Either would be acceptable and appropriate. \n\nBut trying to have a contest with someone because you are so self-entitled that you just can\u2019t handle giving up a little space to another driver- whether it is a situation like yours, or not letting zipper merges happen in a pattern, or whatever, is not only an AH move, but also dangerous.

But yes, you can generally/often sue for insurance costs if the other party was determined to be fault.)\n\nThat said, OP was focused more on following the technical rules than common sense. I see it all the time with drivers who think they have to win or be right. I prefer to drive assuming everyone around me is stupid, not paying attention or malicious. I don't need to win.

If you are ever in an accident you now have to waste probably 30-60 minutes dealing with the other driver and police, and you have to take your vehicle in to a shop where it is probably there for half a day or longer.

If you're in the middle lane in heavy traffic (so you consistently have cars to both sides of you), check if there is empty space behind you so you know if you could brake hard if needed. If you're being tailgated, check to the sides or slow down a bit so there's room in front of you.\n\nSometimes, you can't make any extra space. I've been in traffic where slowing down to make space in front just means more people cut in front of you. But in most driving conditions in my area, I don't even have to try to get myself space, I just make sure I'm aware of where the space is.\n\nSo yes, if OP was being very conscientious and knew there was another car in the fast lane that might also be trying to merge, that could have meant staying put was the best choice (though, by the way, there was still a risk of a multi-car collision if the other driver hit them hard enough to push them out of their lane at all on the other side). But they described the situation in a lot of detail and didn't mention anything about that that I saw. Based on the situation as I understand it, what I would have done is let the driver from the right in and then, if there was a driver from the left that I hadn't noticed and they tried to merge into the same gap, I would have used my horn to alert them both to the danger and hoped they both figured it out in time to get back into their original lanes.\n\nI absolutely see that this is not a perfect solution, but it MIGHT have worked, and we already know that your version caused an accident because it's what OP did.", "There's nothing to indicate he would have hit someone if he'd tapped his brakes.\n\nI drive in the US.

Preferably whoever doesn't have the stone wall on their side). But I do agree that the safest thing is for everyone to follow the rules.

The other driver had to yield to you, but didn't and caused an accident.", "NTA Their insurance rates are not your problem.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvolving the insurance is the reasonable thing.", "you should have let them into your lane, especially if their lane was ending... common courtesy. YTA", "As a California commuter, you\u2019re 100% in the right. Fuck the people that drive slow and expect you to let them in in front of you. Especially when they\u2019re cheating from a turn only lane to try to pass extra cars and switch last second. NTA. Always ask for insurance after an accident. The other driver WILL try to screw you over", "YTA - You have every right to get insurance information, but at the same time you should have just let them over. And after reading this, it sounded like you were technically at fault because your were both speeding and refusing to allow them to safely merge.", "NTA, they should have yielded instead of trying to force you over and hitting you. 100% their fault and they shouldn't be an aggressive driver if they can't handle the consequences", "ESH. They could have slowed down instead of trying to force you to yield but you \"didn't feel like\" giving them space. \n\nYou were petty. Pettiness and wahwah feelings are how people get hurt on the road, they have no place behind the wheel. You had a passenger and put them at risk for your silly and stupid and unnecessary recklessness because you \"didn't wannnaaaa\" let someone get in front of you, like a child. Unbelievably selfish behavior.\n\nINFO: Are you an adult or a baby?", "NTA, but I would have let them in rather than risk an accident. And they should have just turned and went around the block or whatever to get back on the road. But they did turn into you. I am grateful that with traffic moving that quickly that you did not cause a major accident or traffic jam.", "ESH. \n\nYou are driving like an asshole. He should pay for the damages he caused.", "NTA always go through insurance, that\u2019s why we have to have it. Clearly that driver shouldn\u2019t be so reckless. Driving is a privilege not a right. Yes you could have let them in but there are jerk drivers everywhere and them trying to strong arm you into letting them in isn\u2019t right either. They 100% should have higher insurance for driving like that.", "Le sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong, walter, you\u2019re just an asshole.\u201d ESH.", "I'm just gonna say ESH. Both of yall suck. The other person was driving reckless and your response was just as reckless. Youre lucky you're not paying for repairs, and perhaps that's why you're so okay with it. The other person wasn't in the right, but you knew their intentions well enough to write a post about it. Instead of responding in a safe manner, you decided to be stubborn and cause a minor accident. You're lucky it wasn't a really bad one. Just because it's \"right\" on paper doesn't mean it's smart. In my driver course they even said to just let an aggressive driver go because it's not worth the risks of trying to prove a point. Maybe calm down a bit more on the road and remember it's better to get somewhere a few minutes later than not at all.", "NTA because the FAFO but damn, was that worth it to make a point?  You risked MUCH for so little", "NTA. This person hit you and are responsible for the damages. This is why dashcams are a very good investment.", "NTA. I drive very similarly to you though, and it is a very dangerous game you are playing, especially with someone else in the car. Again you aren\u2019t in the wrong for what you did but you are putting yourself at risk. You\u2019re lucky all they did was scratch your car. I\u2019ve seen much worse happen. Again you don\u2019t have to let them over but sometimes it\u2019s good to recognize some people out there are going to be even more reckless and that putting your self in conflict with that type of person could end in bad results. \n\nWith that said I\u2019d done exactly what you did if I was in the car alone. If I have passengers I\u2019m generally more cautious of shitty drivers around me cause it\u2019s not just my/that drivers life at risk\n\nEdit: some of these responses are concerning signs of others driving. If you\u2019re the one merging it\u2019s on you to find the spot to merge not on everyone else to let you over. Sure it\u2019s nice to be courteous but expecting everyone else to constantly accommodate to your driving is way more dangerous driving style than what OP did here", "YTA. I'm pretty sure in every US states driving laws, there is something about a duty to prevent an accident. Those kinds of rules are written for people like you who could have prevented this incident but were too busy being right to think for a moment about your and the other person's safety. I hope the other driver finds this post and uses it to counter your insurance claim.", "ESH, you need to learn how to drive defensively to avoid situations JUST LIKE THIS ONE. Is your pride worth your life? What if your sister got hurt?\n\nLet people drive like maniacs if they want to. Be better.", "ESH- technically you were in the right but as everyone else has said on here, I certainly don\u2019t want to be on the road with people like the other driver OR yourself. Think about everyone else on the road.", "ESH - You can\u2019t drive with this mentality because it causes accidents (I\u2019m not letting them over kind of stuff). You need to be the bigger person and roll with the punches. Who cares, yes there are some shitty drivers out there, but calm down for the sake of lives.", "NTA for getting their insurance but y t a for how you drive. If  you were going so much faster how did you not pass them? You should have just let them over. NO excuse for them to hit you and then expect you to let it go though", "With his SISTER in the car. I would be livid. How dare you endanger your sisters life so you can stick your guns about being \u201cright\u201d. I would take his car away SO fast.\n\nLike none of this is worth someone\u2019s life. In fact, it\u2019s not worth it all.", "Yeah, I agree. It's just not worth it to be \"right\" if it's going to cause an accident. You know what I do when I see someone driving erratically or aggressively? I stay the fuck away from them. So either slow down so they can pass me or get in another lane. OP is young so hopefully this will be something they learn as they get older, but it's just not worth proving your point. Also, it is kind of a shitty move to not let someone over when they're lane is ending. It seems it was pretty clear what the other driver was trying to do. And how was OP going faster than them if they were actually ahead of OP?", "I would argue that there was no safe or reasonable evasive action that op could take.", "Most highway patrol departments are now telling people to stop being \"cordial\" as it makes the roads less safe.", "It does, sometimes. It\u2019s called [The Wave of Death. ](https://www.callkleinlawyers.com/full-disclosure/wave-death-polite-can-get-killed/)", "Seriously. No one\u2019s getting anywhere fast. Just let the other person over instead of this bizarre power move. It makes no sense to be *this impatient* as to get into a collision, which takes additional time to exchange info. This all sounds like OP was happily and consciously playing a game of chicken and I hope his insurance adjuster finds this post. If you\u2019re so immature that following someone doing the actual speed limit annoys you so much that you potentially cause harm to others, you shouldn\u2019t be driving. His sister was in the passenger seat, she could\u2019ve been showered in broken glass or hurt because of this ridiculous move.", "Because they are shitty drivers that think the road belongs to them. They expect everyone to accommodate them.", "As long as op maintained the same speed before and after the other driver began to signal and it was a zipper merge then that can't be considered improper behavior.", "Lol ok sure, so next time I\u2019ll take my car, I\u2019ll make you to behave like a raging asshole to make the roads safer \ud83d\ude02", "How is this partial fault? Op was driving at a consistent speed and the other driver switched lanes into him. There was no unique obstruction in the road, or other situation that would that would change the rule of traffic. If the insurance came back as partial fault I would immediately fight it.", "Burmashave.", "So true! My brother always says you can be DEAD right!", "This is one of those cases where the op was technically correct, but what they were doing was dangerous. The safe thing to do would be either to speed up and just pass the other driver or slow down and let them in.", "That's the law in the US, yeah. There are idiots who stop completely rather than take the turn (and so risk accidents). What people are saying is OP may have had right of way, but they should have planned on the other driver being an idiot. Teen!Me was taught Defensive Driving is assuming every other driver/pedestrian/etc. is an idiot and that means I take actions to prevent an accident, even if it means letting someone who doesn't have right of way take the turn/go below the speed limit for 10 miles rather than get close to the idiot swerving/wait an extra second at a green light for the idiot who tried to run a yellow and ran a red instead/etc.\n\nOP is TECHNICALLY completely in their rights, legally, and did nothing wrong. The blame for this whole thing is 100% on the other driver. On the other hand,  if they had made different choices (not letting the other driver merge, not slowing down, etc.) the accident wouldn't have happened. It's very much like victim blaming, but when (the other driver refuses to pay/someone gets hurt or could've gotten hurt/your insurance rate goes up because of any accident/whatever) it's hard to clearly see that, and any car accident could cause injury, court cases, and headache that people want to avoid.", "I'm from the UK too and another option is to safely come to a stop with your indicator on, signalling that you have made a mistake and intend on switching lanes. Nothing in the highway code to state that you can't handle a mistake safely!", "Exactly!  Reading OP's other comments, OP was going 45 + (2 or 3) = (47 or 48), and the other driver was going from 35 - 40, they should've been passing them at a rate of 7 to 13 mph.  How did the driver have time to stare?\n\nIt kind of sounded like OP was driving along in dude's blind spot, and then was amazed when they got hit.\n\nAnd I wonder what the cops are gonna make of all this.  OP (or, more accurately, OP's mom and dad) may wind up paying for this little bit of stupidity.\n\n(I like to drive fast, but I strive to ensure that no one else is inconvenienced so that I can go fast.  I would've moved over to let them in.)", "Wow so OP is all around TA lol", "I'm lost on your logic here. So the person who you say is the asshole and at fault. Is the person following the rules of the road not the person who by the definition you gave committed the action...So I have to assume then that you think every drunk or high driver has the right to do what they want on the road and if they kill a family by cutting them off then the family was the assholes for not getting out of their way.\n\nI'm not saying defensive driving is bad but it is literally only needed because you defend people like this. Someone committed a crime and almost killed someone but the person who got hit was the asshole to you. Not going to lie that is pretty fucked up.", "You're funny.  Why do you think the driver that needed to move over has no responsibility here?", "I\u2019ll keep that in mind if ever get a chance to visit her.", "Some states have laws on the books about letting someone overtake you once they change lanes, but I think those are for two lane roads", "The reason that the merging car needs to yield is that this way at least 2 assholes are needed to cause an accident, yet if the law was the other way, assholes merging and insisting on their right of way can easily create accidents by sideways ramming even defensive drivers.", "After reading OP's comments, I'm a little confused.\n\nOP was driving 47 - 48, overtaking at a pretty good clip, was just coming out of the other driver's blind spot when they put on the turn signal, yet the other driver was staring at them the whole time for not letting them in?  And intentionally tried to swerve into them?\n\nI suspect that OP is mistaken about one or more of these things, and depending on what story OP and the other driver told the cops, the cops may also wonder about what actually happened.\n\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're supposed to look before merging, and it's totally on the person merging to make sure that the space is clear.  I'm just saying that something doesn't make sense here.)", "I am in no way defending the guy that caused the accident.\n\nThis isnt a \"one guy is the good guy and the other guy is the bad guy\" situation.\n\nThis is a \"one guy is the bad guy and yet the other is still far worse\" situation. Op is far from the worst here, but he is still a bad guy, because it would have cost him nothing to prevent a traffic accident and that was apparently still too much for him/her.\n\nIf hypothethically speaking you had a button appear in front of you and if you press it you can prevent a traffic accident and the button disappears again. Would you press it? Op answered that question with a solid \"No\" and that makes him an asshole too.", "Here is the expert jurisdiction's driving handbook if you want to try that again.     \n  \n   https://imgur.com/a/NthFKFv   b\n     \nBut pop off I guess.", "And I would kick back that OP took all reasonable actions by maintaining a consistent speed.

When they first moved to GA, they pissed of so many GA drivers because of their Masshole driving.", "I try to imagine that they must have a medical issue going on and have to get to a hospital. I've been the one in that situation. \n\nHowever, my general rule of thumb is if the other car is in front of me (center line to center line) I back off, even if I'm \"right\", because it's safer. If they are behind, I accelerate slightly so they can move over after me.", "I don't understand why you think this is a ego battle. Its plain and simple. One driver is following the rules. Anotger driver broke the rules and essentially tried to kill someone. You believe that the person who was reckless and tried to kill someone was within their right to do so??? They shouldn't have an repercussions for their actions because God forbid they be held to the same standard as everyone else. OP DIDN'T CAUSE THE ACCIDENT! They were hit from someone who was breaking the law. Someone who should be expected to merge properly or take the turn. You are so focused on someone following the rules that you condone the actions of someone who is trying to harm people."]}
