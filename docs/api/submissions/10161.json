{"id": 10161, "submission_id": "1148znt", "title": "AITA for making a driver give me his insurance after he hit my car?", "selftext": "I was driving home from practice today. My sister was in the passenger seat. I was in a rush to get home. While I was driving I was in the middle lane out of 3. A person in the lane to my right was trying to switch lanes in front of me and I wasn\u2019t letting them. They had been driving slow and I didn\u2019t feel like letting them in because I was going faster, but their lane was close to ending and when it did they\u2019d have to make a turn. There was no car directly behind me, if they wanted to they could have slowed down even more and switched lanes behind me. They didn\u2019t want to do that but we\u2019re getting impatient since I wasn\u2019t letting them in, so they decided to switch lanes anyways and try to scare me into letting them in, even though they knew I was beside them. I didn\u2019t budge and they swiped the side of my car and went back to their lane.\n\nI slowed down and told my sister to take a picture of their license plate. I rolled down the window and had her signal the driver to pull over. They pulled over and I told them to give me their insurance. They had scratched up the right side of my car pretty good, as well as the left side of their own car. The driver told me that they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the cost of their insurance rate increasing from the accident and asked me to let it go. I told them I wasn\u2019t going to let it go and that if they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for the damages they shouldn\u2019t have caused them. They gave me their insurance info, but they called me a heartless asshole and said I should have just let them switch lanes. I think I\u2019m in the right and that it\u2019s their fault for recklessly trying to force me to yield, but my sister thinks I should have just let them change lanes and that I shouldn\u2019t have taken their insurance since my parents can afford to pay the damages, although they would be pissed about it. I told her the driver could have been lying to get out of paying and that they brought it on themselves. We argued over it while I finished the drive home. The argument has stuck with me through the night, so I wanted to ask here. So let me know, AITA?\n\nEdit: I saw someone bring it up so I just wanted to clarify, when I say I had them give me their insurance I mean that I went through the normal process for after a crash in order to have insurance handle it. In my state you exchange insurance, license, and call the cops. I answered questions from the authorities and gave them my insurance. I let them handle the other driver once they arrived. The process went relatively quickly and I drove home when they said I could. I shortened it for the post, but I realize it\u2019s probably good to clarify this for anyone who is worried about if I went through the proper process.\n\nEdit 2: Seen people bring this up so I want to clarify it here, the other car was in a turn lane not a zipper merge. At the end of the lane you have to make a right turn into a shopping center. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve also seen people be confused by my poor phrasing of some things so I\u2019ll try to be more clear about the situation. I was going at a consistent speed of 48 MPH, the speed limit is 45. People in my area honk and tailgate if you go the speed limit, it\u2019s normal to go 2-3 over. Cops in my area don\u2019t care unless you\u2019re going 5 or more over, so it\u2019s typically safer to speed slightly. To my left was the fast lane, where there were cars going well over 50 and I remember being easily passed many times. To my right was the turn only lane. The right lane doesn\u2019t last long. Most of my drive home is 2 lanes, then it splits into 3 for a short time. The 3rd lane is mostly used for people who want to make turns, although some people also use it as a way to go slower. It first begins a little bit before it gives the opportunity to turn onto the highway, then it turns to a church, finally it turns to the shopping center and then goes back to 2 lanes. I usually stay in the right lane because the turn to get to my neighborhood and house is from the right lane, is it\u2019s easiest to stay in this one lane the whole drive. The person in the turn only lane was going somewhere between 35-40 MPH and must not have realized it was turn only. I was in the process of passing them when they turned on their turn signal. The front half of my car was aligned with the back half of their car. I hope that I have cleared up some questions.", "created_utc": 1676603021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1148znt/aita_for_making_a_driver_give_me_his_insurance/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cops almost never pull you over in my area unless you go 5 over so I usually go 2-3 over, as does almost everyone else.

For a while I would just start walking once I got to it, regardless if cars were coming.  I have the right of way right? What could go wrong? One day I started crossing and one of the cars also didn\u2019t give a damn and would have hit me if I didn\u2019t stop just in time.

You know the old saying \u201cHere lies Joe.  He had the right of way\u201d.  I realized laws don\u2019t protect you physically from stupidity, you do.
