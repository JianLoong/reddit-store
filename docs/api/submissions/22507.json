Grandma sucks, obviously. Your fianc\u00e9 sucks because because he won\u2019t respect your wishes that she not be involved in your wedding, and you are fully justified in that. He absolutely can \u201cjust not invite her,\u201d and given her vitriol for you, he should. If he\u2019s not willing to have your back against family who were clearly in the wrong- who remain completely unapologetic- then he\u2019s not ready to be married; not to you or anybody. That said, then you should say that. Tying your marriage to her death is morbid af, and you suck for that.  This needs be about the true obstacle, which isn\u2019t his asshole grandma, it\u2019s his unwillingness to stand up to her for wronging you.", "YTA - So the opinion of his grandmother matters more to you than your bf? This is the wrong message to send to your man 100%, I get wanting an apology, I really do, but doing this to me feels like giving her the win and fucking your relationship up. Do you love him more than you hate her? \n\nShe called to fuck your relationship up, now YOU'RE the one fucking your relationship up. Don't do that OP, get married, have the lady there, give her the \"oh my gosh thank you all for coming\" and move on with your day. One person being there you don't like has nothing to do with your relationship, the ship only cares about the water that gets inside, anything kept outside doesn't sink her.", "If your bf won\u2019t stand for you, isn\u2019t he standing against you? And I have to wonder if it was a pocket dial, or did he want you to hear what she was saying? \n\nNTA. \n\nBut maybe just don\u2019t marry someone who allows anyone to speak of you in feral terms.", "NTA, does your BF stand up to any of his other family? If not, you may be waiting a lot longer than you expect.", "This may be my petty ass but I would marry him! Give her the front role seat. Make it look like I am the bigger person! I would even hand her a rose and as I was leaning in to kiss her I would quietly whisper: \u201c I won!\u201d\n\nHell I would even have an10x12 wedding photo blown up framed and sent to her! \n\n\nThen I would spend the rest of her life making everyone think I forgave her but in private I make sure she knew I spend every second making her precious grandson know exactly what she is!\n\nI make sure she know my ass wasn\u2019t going anywhere!", "ESH.

If he allows her to disrespect you like that, anything could go.", "NTA. Good for you.", "YTA - You aren't marrying grandma, and her opinion doesn't matter. But, if this is a big deal, then you should call off the wedding and move on.", "The best revenge is to live a happy life. Invite her to the wedding. Stop letting her get to you. Her opinion matters to no one but herself. Live, laugh, and have a happy marriage, nothing will offend her more than that.", "NTA but why do you put all the blame on the grandma? It is your fiance that does not have your back.

If you\u2019re not willing to marry him because of how his family member feels about you, that\u2019s valid. But either marry him or don\u2019t. You have no clue how long his grandmother has, and don\u2019t expect him to be willing to wait an indefinite amount of time to marry you. Either you\u2019ve got a strong relationship with some you trust and care about, and who trusts and cares about you in return, or you don\u2019t. Decide what this one incident means for your relationship and either break up with him or get married. Insisting on waiting until she dies, despite there being no indication that would even happen in the near future, is just trying to have it both ways, and that never works out.", "ESH.

If you can't get past it, then don't.  I'm not saying you should.  However this is basically emotional manipulation that you are doing.   \n\nI don't know how long grandma has left, but its not fair to him, if he is someone who wants to get married and start a family.", "YTA - so you have now tied a sad event - his grandma passing and what is supposed to be a happy life event - getting married. \n\nHow do you think that is going to work out for you in the future. it would always be in the back of my mind that my happy day couldn't happen with out killing off grandma - so always a mixed bag of emotions. Either you love him and accept all of him even his family who you don't like or you don't. it is really that simple. \n\nMarry him or don't but stop putting stipulations on it. That doesn't seem  right to put that on him.", "Yeah YTA... You're marrying him not the grma... just ignore her", "Stop letting this woman have so much power over your life. Get married. Elope. Have the wedding of your dreams and invite the old lady. Pick one. I don't care.  She'll be the type to live until she's 99. Are you really not seeing her at any family parties or do you skip everything?  Isolate yourself? That does nothing for you.", "NTA but you will be an AH to yourself if you marry him.   \nHe has already shown you that he wont stand up for you in such a major confrontation", "ESH. Just break up already", "YTA You're being so petty that you're literally putting a marriage and the beginning of your married life together on hold because someone you don't like needs to die first.  Do you hear how horrible that sounds? Better to keep discussing with your bf not inviting her or something rather than waiting for his literal family to die. \n\nYou're letting grandma win. She's getting her way by you putting this stipulation in place. With that kind of motivation, she'll live to be 100. Your pettiness is what's going to keep her alive.", "Have you and your fianc\u00e9 ever actually talked about this with his grandma?  With his parents? Or is it just a situation of everyone knows but no one talks about it? How would his parents react if grandma wasn\u2019t invited? I don\u2019t have a sense of whether this is a grandma thing only and the others would support you.  But other posters are correct, grandma could live for another 15-20 years.  Waiting that long could keep you from having a family (if you want to wait to be married for that).  You are both giving her way too much power over your lives.

BF hasn't stuck up for you which sucks. They are both huge AHs. \n\nWaiting for her to die however is a weak band-aid solution. The issue is someone egregiously insulted you and your family and your boyfriend not only took it, it didn't affect his relationship with that person and you're meant to just let bygones be bygones and have that person at your wedding. Even when she is long gone the hurt of that won't be resolved, only attempted to be forgotten. You're just trying to bury something awful that happened, but it's something that should've been dealt with 6 years ago, and needs to be dealt with now. You two should absolutely enter couples therapy, even if she were to pass tomorrow.", "Wait, it is so worth it. My husband and I had been dating for 4 years when his Grandmother pissed me off. It was Mother's Day and we went to my MIL's for lunch. I had just gotten out of the car and said Happy Mother's Day to his Grandmother. She turns to us and asks \"When are you two getting married or are you going to have a bunch of bastards like them?\" pointing to her grandchildren. All 3 of them could hear her, not one of them was older than 10. I was so pissed I told her I would get married on her grave. \n\nI didn't get married on her grave but I did wait until she died. She begged us, she wanted one couple in her family to not live in sin. She wanted to know her family was right by God. I do not regret taking that from her. She did not deserve to see our wedding, our love or relationship had nothing to do with her version of marriage. \n\nNTA, it will also teach his family that you will not tolerate disrespect. It has made my life easier, my in-laws know I will stick to my word. \n\nMy husband and I have been together for 27 years, married for 18.", "What compromise did he offer?", "I disagree that it\u2019s not fair to him.

I misread ..comment re edited", "Sure, that isn't fair either.  So maybe the result is a marriage isn't going to happen for them.  And if that is the case, that should be the conversation.  But saying it will be when she dies seems shitty.", "Agreed. This is super morbid, and actually pretty gross. If I were him, I\u2019d end the engagement.
