What is there to be sympathetic about? NTA. I feel sorry for the bird.", "NTA your sister deserved every second of those 3 words", "You were right, she was actively mistreating her parrot. Glad that her bf lectured her. \n\nYes your \u00ab\u00a0told you so\u00a0\u00bb is petty, but pettiness should be forgiven when animal well being is at stake. \n\nNTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYour mum and sister though... Animals arent experiments. A person should know what theyre signing up for.", "NTA. does your sister not know how to use google! sounds more like her thinking she knows best, and was pissed about being proved wrong, rather than being concerned for her bird's welfare.", "NTA, if only because I would have done the same thing as you.", "NTA", "Nta. Typically the \"told you so\" comment is unnecessary as they already know and are thinking about the fact that you were right, but her whining about it made it justified because you did try to warn her.", "NTA, it\u2019s super easy to goggle proper diet for a parrot.", "NTA. All people should do proper research before owning a pet, especially people who keep wild exotic species with special requirements as pets. Shame on her.", "Not to be rude, but talk about first world problems. NTA, btw. However, this really isn't worthy of any conflict. It's such a small 'argument, I'm not even sure why you feel the need for further validation (from a bunch of internet strangers). It's like your mother didn't agree with your approach - so you want some further external 'validation', to 'win' the argument over your sister. \n\nBut it's really not that deep. Just move on.\nShe was in the wrong; got corrected, and should just take it like a big girl. 'Whining' over it, is indeed an immature response. She should instead say she was wrong; that she's really glad she found out for the sake of her pet, and she'd do more research next time. Meanwhile, you should just let it go, rather than needing to further 'prove' she was in the wrong.", "Your sister is ignorant,  and you are petty \n\nESH", "\"I told you so\" adds exactly nothing useful.", "This is entirely a non-issue. Why is this even an AITA discussion?", "No one likes smug. YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't need a boyfriend as a vet to show you how to properly take care of a pet. It's not that hard to research something in order to get it right. \n\nI am not a fan of \"I told you so's\" most of the time, but this was one of those times where it was applicable.", "NTA but your mom and sister are.  Not knowing better is not an excuse to have a malnourished pet.  Her bird is her responsibility and it really isn\u2019t that hard to do a quick Google to see what kind of care they need.", "Love a justified \"Told you so\" NTA", "NTA. You tried to educate her, but she wouldn't listen. Does she not know how to use Google?", "NTA...it's called Google. It would have taken her 5 seconds to find out you were right..and she wouldn't have gotten that lecture.", "Fellow parrot owner here. Absolutely NTA.\n  \nParrots need a varied diet of mostly organic veggies, grains, small amounts of fruit, and maybe some high quality pellets. Seeds are treats only. Your sister is significantly shortening the lifespan of her bird \ud83d\ude25", "NTA. She did know better as you mentioned it, and it would've taken her all of 5 minutes to google proper nutrition for her bird or ask a vet when she first got the bird. I don't have much sympathy for pet owners who don't make sure they *know* how to properly care for their babies. It's kind of a requirement.", "\"She did know better. I told her, she just wouldn't believe me until she got told off by a vet.\"", "Taking 60 seconds to do a little research would have backed up that parrots need fresh produce and pellets; seeds are meant to be a junk food snack. That poor bird probably has deficiencies and is likely overweight", "By definition \"pettiness\" has no value, it is not improving the well-being of the animal here, that is already done by the boyfriend's lecture.\n\nSister is an AH for not knowing how to care for her pet, not just because she is not listening to the brother but because no one should have a pet without doing a bit of research into how to care for them.\n\nThe petty comment does nothing except inflate OPs pride, and make them look like a child by furthering the sister's embarrassment for no gain to anyone.\n\nWhen your behaviour is making someone feel bad, the only objective criteria to consider about whether the behavior is AH is whether the primary intention is to improve something and feeling bad is a byproduct or whether making someone feel bad is the primary intention, here it is the latter.", "THIS!!! Google is your friend!!!", "No one should be starving their bird of nutrition because they can't take two minutes to google what they should be feeding. Or just listen to someone that has a bird as well and has done the search (or you know taking it to its yearly vet exam and asking there.. there's so many options to find info).\n\nThe told you so definitely won't get sister on ops side, I just hope she at least starts taking care of the bird properly now that another person has told her she needs to do better for the parrot.", "Yes sure", "I\u2019m not being asked to decide whether the sister is an AH for not knowing parrot nutrition, as egregious as it is.\n\nI\u2019m being asked to judge if OP is an AH for saying \u201cI told you so\u201d."]}
