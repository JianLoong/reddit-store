Each bag is a day's worth of food for all 5 birds. Then all I have to do is pour food into bowls for 3 months. It saves money and cuts down on food waste. Each week I pick a fresh green to add to the chop (spinach is very popular). I spend about $200 up front on the ingredients and it works out to be about $65/month to feed 5 birds so much cheaper than my dog! FYI for anyone wanting to make big batches of chop to freeze: do not include smelly veggies like broccoli, kohlrabi, cabbage. Cauliflower is fine. If you add the aforementioned veggies your chop will STINK and you will hate your life. Fruit doesn't freeze well and will make your chop mushy and brown.

I still think NTA in this situation as the sister was smug herself acting like she knew this and that about feeding birds. Ignoring the context isn\u2019t how you vote btw, the whole point of them delivering the story is because you\u2019re obviously supposed to take it into consideration while answering the main question:\n\n****AITA for telling my sister \u201ctold you so\u201d after she got called out?****\n\n**No, you\u2019re not.** Taking in context, OP is not. Sister is a major asshole and OP was originally trying to help her. It\u2019s not like he called her stupid or something, sister needs to grow up.\n\nSearch Keywords- YTA, ESH, INFO, AH", "I'm sorry, I love animals and I'm not a pet owner, and if I ever would be I'd be sure to do my research but... do people take their fish to the vet?

Fish only make sense if the fish is large and expensive.", "Most bird vet visits are not helpful. The vet waiting rooms are NOT cleaned in a way that will kill beak and feather virus. Full Stop.\n\nUnless your vet texted vet can tell you two or more pathogens that can live on the dust in the waiting room for more than a year and can kill your bird, and then explain how they clean the waiting room in a way where these pathogens cannot accumulate, they're not a good bird vet.", "Birds - particularly smaller ones - can be incredibly highly strung. \n\nIt may have been bad advice, but my local vet cautioned that moving the bird could stress it out so much that it did more harm than good. \n\nHah, I also really struggled to find a vet which treated 'exotic' animals. \n\nLots of information is available online though.", "You have a good point and I agree. I did have a laugh at myself for trying to figure out how to take a fish to the vet. I've read that japanese vets are very skilled with fish, mostly koi I imagine.", "True that.

I have approximately 10 regular vets and 2 emergency vets in a 10 mile radius, including 2 less than 10 minutes from my house and neither have a vet who sees \"exotic \" animals.  The 2 vets I have used are not full time at those practices so getting an appointment isn't easy.  Learned how to clip nails myself and unfortunately had 2 die in our arms because we couldn't find one in an emergency", "My experience with hamsters is that vets won't do *anything* with them.  The little guy's intestine had prolapsed and they just said they don't do anything for hamsters.  I begged them to at *least* humanely put him down then.  They would not.  I was a teenager and I'm still mad about it.  They didn't seem to give a single crap.", "You take hamsters and fish to the vet? I only have a cat, so this is blowing my mind a little.", "How many people treat their parrots is horrific. They're incredibly intelligent and long-lived, and need loads of enrichment, proper nutrition and definitely regular vet care. They're also not domesticated, so need to have the same needs met as their wild counterparts. \n\nInstead, people stick them in too-small cages, don't let them fly, and feed them cheap seeds. There's a reason so many parrots have serious behavioral issues! \n\nIt's really depressing how many people treat them as a cute accessory rather than creatures with rich social and emotional lives. It's legitimately cruel.", "And in the supermarket you can buy big bags of candy but you shouldn't eat only those.

It\u2019s ok, it\u2019s just a different opinion. I took it all into context. I\u2019ve already said that her treatment of the parrot put her in the wrong, and it was unnecessary of her to scoff, thinking she knew best, when clearly, she didn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t been questioned.\n\nThe question is clear, there\u2019s no subtext. There\u2019s no doubt that OP\u2019s sister is an AH, for her own smugness and neglect of her pet, so I felt it fair to use the standard set by OP, using the *context* of the post, to answer the *question*. You differ, that\u2019s ok! Your opinion is just as valid x", "This is true. We had/have to take our parrot and lizard to an exotic vet about 35 minutes away from home and it was very expensive. Our regular vet sees cats, dogs, ferrets, hedgehogs, chickens and ducks, but not parrots, lizards, fish or other livestock. And growing up our larger animals need a large animal vet, even farther away and more expensive, though they sometimes made house calls, specifically for issues that might result in euthanizing.\n\nBut it\u2019s on the pet owner to make sure they can get to and afford an exotic vet if they have an exotic pet, so OP is NTA and OP\u2019s sister needs to be a better pet owner.\n\n(Added more info.)", "The only vet I can find for my parrot will trim her beak and claws and that's about it.

Heck, pet stores sell Betta fish in tiny boxes too and let ppl think that is okay.", "I learned how difficult it was to care properly for fishes through a TV show from a company specialised in huge fishtanks.

I was more-so replying to your OG comment where you claimed Y T A because OP was being \u201cSmug\u201d. Then I saw in your follow up comment that you were simply answering the question, implying the context that the Redditor you replied to didn\u2019t matter. The only thing you\u2019ve actually put against the sister is calling the birds diet \u201cegregious\u201d, but none of what you accused in that paragraph.

To me, if you aren't able to get to or afford an exotic vet, then don't have an exotic pet.
