Each bag is a day's worth of food for all 5 birds. Then all I have to do is pour food into bowls for 3 months. It saves money and cuts down on food waste. Each week I pick a fresh green to add to the chop (spinach is very popular). I spend about $200 up front on the ingredients and it works out to be about $65/month to feed 5 birds so much cheaper than my dog! FYI for anyone wanting to make big batches of chop to freeze: do not include smelly veggies like broccoli, kohlrabi, cabbage. Cauliflower is fine. If you add the aforementioned veggies your chop will STINK and you will hate your life. Fruit doesn't freeze well and will make your chop mushy and brown.

Most vets will see them, but only the specialists have any idea what they're doing. I'm lucky to have one in town. But I'm waiting weeks for an appointment.", "It can be very difficult to find a vet who will treat birds. Even the ones who will treat them don\u2019t always know everything. The parrot I had many years ago began getting dark bands on her flight feathers. The nearest vet who saw exotics was at the vet program at a university several cities away. They had no clue and she was otherwise healthy.", "Yes. This. My friend has birds and travels two hours to a vet that specializes in birds. She also pays through the nose to see him and says it is 100% worth it.", "That's a bingo. My daughter has been searching for a vet to see her parakeet (budgie) for almost 3 years. There are only two within a reasonable distance and neither are accepting new patients. Closest one is 45 miles away.", "Why would you have a pet you can't help if it gets ill? It seems very risky and frankly unfair to the pet to put it in this situation.", "Most avian vets are in private practice...", "Rabbits do need annual vaccination! In the UK we vaccinate against rabbit haemorrhagic disease and myxomatosis. I believe in the US the myxo vaccine isn\u2019t approved yet. But definitely get your little ones vaccinated, as they\u2019re horrible diseases.", "Rabbits should be fixed for their own health. https://rabbit.org/care/spaying-neutering/", "If your vet knows nothing about Rabbits - bearing in mind I literally just finished a year long animal care course where one of my teachers WAS a REGISTERED VET - they are probably a cowboy and I would look them up online to make sure they have a license. \n\nThat's like going into a Dr surgery for a chest infection, and them saying \"sorry our Dr doesn't know anything about lung function\".\n\nA vet, even if they are not a specialist, has to go through a level 3(or 4) three to four year medical course in veterinary medicine. \nIf your vet is so ill-informed.... I'd worry.", "Thank you for taking the time to educate them, even if they weren't asshats.  I currently have a 30 gallon tank that I've been tending to for 3 years now. I always get questions because I have a lot of live plants and not fake and my water isn't crystal clear because it has tannins in it from the natural wood structures.   I only have one artificial decoration and it's a crashed TARDIS lol.  I'm told I need to clean my tank because my water has a slight tan color tint.  Or that I'm going to poison my fish because I have pothos growing hydroponically from the tank.   I don't mean this to sound judgy regarding fake plants or decor. But just the contrast between what people see is all fish need based on these \"kits\" you get at the local big box pet store vs what all you can actually do and accomplish if you research the fish you plan to house. And yeah fake plants and decor can be perfectly fine, they just don't contribute to a self sustaining eco system in the same way.", "Then \"I told you so\" shuts down any chance of further conversation to help her understand why she is wrong by putting her on the defensive.\n\nWhat is OP trying to gain from the statement? Is he trying to further help the parrot? There are so many better ways to achieve that end.\n\nI get that \"I told you so\" feels good to say and I get that making someone whose ignorant and arrogant mistake hurts another living being hurt can also feel good. \n\nIt doesn't change the fact that if your motive is to hurt someone rather than to improve the life of the parrot then your behavior is an AH move.", "exactly!! there's no excuse for not doing research when we all carry the freaking internet wherever we go lol", "I filled a tramadol prescription once for a turkey.", "Also, for smaller animals the amount of times I hear \"but they only cost \u00a310\" or \"they're only  a rescue mouse/rat/guinea pigu, now you can get a real one you raised\". :/ \n\nWhen one of them heard that the cost of my next rat cage they showed me this; https://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/pets-at-home-hamster-wire-cage apparently that'd be a palace...\n\nThe wheel would hurt them, it's too tiny, no enrichment, no good hides. I use that model to travel to the vet, as a temporary hospital cage. People also leave their 7 year olds solely in charge and wonder why Thumper dies. Don't even get me started on Goldfish! Plain animal cruelty.", "How about having the cops called on you twice for taking a 12 ft bermese python to the vet.  I tied him up in a sleeping bag and carried him out to the car, went back in for like 10 mins, cops show up saying I just put a dead body in my car. Handcuffs, but out of 5 cops they wouldn't open this moving sleeping bag in my car. They uncuff me and let me open it. I pull him out and wrap him around me as I do. The cops moved from 2 ft to 15 ft away.  Had me move, checked the bag, and said sorry, you can take him to the vet now. A few weeks later it happened again. After that I am certain every cop, dispatcher, and 911 operator in the city and probably the state knew the story as it never happened again.", "I had chickens growing up. If they get more sick than we could help with, we just put em down.", "I wonder why mine said that ..", "Should be, yes! Unfortunately in my own experience, I had a rabbit die a very painful death because the vet didn't know how to neuter a rabbit.", "I'm a vet and we get pretty strongly warned not to treat species we're not 100% comfortable with because the board complaints if something goes wrong aren't worth the stress and massive fines (one friend had to pay $6k to two states for a surgical complication).", "The sister obviously doesn't want to understand, otherwise she'd have listened in the first place.\n\n\"I told you so\" in this case literally meaning \"I told you, why did you not listen?\"\n\nIf the sister were reasonable, she'd say \"Yeah, I should have listened, I'll listen to your advice about parrots next time\"\n\nBut all she did was complain.", "So what you\u2019re saying is the plan worked and you can now dispose of bodies and the cops will assume it is a snake. Got it haha", "I just got the most evil grin. You have a banked opportunity there.", "I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you have access to a better vet for any future pets.", "Not like that in the UK. Vets are covered under emergency situations, and as long as they can prove they did everything they could, no harm is done. There are both specialists and exotic vets. \nSay you have a snake suffering from impaction, you've tried helping at home but the snake is in decline. \nIf you call your vets and they are unavailable, they WILL refer you to the nearest vets on an emergency basis, and most vets will do what they can. \nIf, say, the impaction is too great - and requires surgery. This does come with risks. But leaving it will kill it anyway - so vets are obligated by the Animal Welfare Act of 2006 to not \"cause harm or prolong suffering\". If the animal is in pain and in trouble - they MUST act. \nIf you're not comfortable with a certain animal, that's on you and the place you got your qualification/license.\n\nTake me, I'm shit-scared of spiders. Used to run out the room over a damn hatchling. I ended up looking after 17 tarantulas all at once (half of which were quick and venomous - two Togo Starburts, a Rusty Baboon (the brown form of the OBT which if you know spiders OBTs are psycho) just to name some) and now? I can tell, just from looking, if one is fine/grumpy/in pre-shed, etc. Because now I have experience. \n\nIf, after a 3-4 year medical course, you don't \" feel comfortable \" treating certain species - you shouldn't be a vet, in my opinion. A vet is there for ALL animals. Whether it's a dog, a rabbit, a horse or a damn axolotl."]}
