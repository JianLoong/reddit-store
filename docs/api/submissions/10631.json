On the handful of occasions she\u2019s attended our family gatherings, she\u2019s been very reserved and quiet, giving one word answers or just smiling whenever someone tries to strike up a conversation. Mostly she makes some excuse and just doesn\u2019t show up.\n\nBecause of this, my brother has also stopped attending the family gatherings as much as before. My parents are very disappointed with this and my brother\u2019s absence makes them visibly upset. I\u2019ve asked my brother about it, and he\u2019s always maintained that SIL is very introverted and has social anxiety and that he\u2019s not gonna force her into doing something she doesn\u2019t like.\n\nNext week is our dad\u2019s 70th birthday and ofc, my brother and his family are invited. This is supposed to be a grand event with all of our extended family going on a weekend trip. Yesterday, SIL texted me saying that she won\u2019t be coming for the trip. The conversation went something like this: \n\nSIL: Hey,I\u2019m so sorry but something urgent has come up and I won\u2019t be able to attend the event. It\u2019s gonna be only (my brother). \n\nMe : At least (niece) is coming, right?\n\nSIL : Oh I would love for her to attend but she\u2019s saying that she won\u2019t attend without me.\n\nMe: Then why don\u2019t you stop being a stuck up b*tch for once and attend the event since it would mean a lot to my dad if the entire family was there!\n\nSIL didn\u2019t respond after that. Few mins later I got a call from my brother and he was furious.  He said that the way I talked to his wife was very disrespectful and that he will not be coming for the trip until I apologise. I refused to apologise because I felt this was long overdue. So now brother isn\u2019t coming for the trip.

At least your brother has his priorities right and put you in your place.", "YTA. \u201cStuck up bitch\u201d is your narrative about what\u2019s going on - you have ZERO proof that she is, in fact, stuck up. Social anxiety could be one plausible reason. Not liking your family and drawing reasonable boundaries to keep the peace is another. \n\nMy friends and I were once called \u201cstuck up\u201d because we didn\u2019t go to a party. But we didn\u2019t go not because we were stuck up, but because our coach didn\u2019t allow us to. It\u2019s real easy for people to form unwarranted narratives about other people in their heads.", "YTA\n\nShe has social anxiety and your response is to insult her? I get your disappointment, but you've just made it less likely your brother will show up. My family includes people with anxiety and we warmly welcome them when they're able to show up and don't push them away through insults and assumptions about their motivation.", "YTA, completely. If she has social anxiety or some other mental health thing going on, family gatherings with people she doesn\u2019t know very well can be very stressful. Or maybe she just doesn\u2019t like you. Either way, she doesn\u2019t owe you or your family her time, especially since she\u2019s not stopping her husband or niece from attending things. And what you did definitely doesn\u2019t help in any way and has now alienated your brother, so good job there. She also doesn\u2019t owe you or your family an explanation. Your brother is fine with the situation, so you should\u2019ve just backed off. \n\nI\u2019m a shy introvert with general anxiety. When I first meet new people, I\u2019m quiet and reserved (but polite). I can\u2019t help it, it\u2019s who I am, but many people have told me they thought I was a \u201cstuck up bitch\u201d after I open up more. That\u2019s their problem, not mine. And your attitude towards your SIL is your problem, not hers. Get over it.", "YTA. That was totally uncalled for.", "YTA. You could've just asked at any point why she doesn't feel like coming to things rather than exploding like an asshole. And if you did already asked and she was non-committal, take the hint and leave her alone. Having social anxiety doesn't make you a stuck up bitch. Expecting people to cater to you and attend things because you want them to then calling them names makes you the stuck up bitch.", "YTA. I\u2019m very glad your brother has her back on this one because damn, you and your mother don\u2019t sound as welcoming as you\u2019re portraying yourselves to be.", "I\u2019m introverted and have social anxiety as well. It is exhausting and causes a whole host of other issues to go to social gatherings. I feel for her. Moreover, with the way you spoke to her I\u2019m sure there are other reasons as to why she doesn\u2019t want to be around you or your family.", "Having social anxiety is not being stuck up or rude. She doesn\u2019t have to go. Calling someone names is rude, however, so yeah YTA", "YTA  \n\n\nIf she doesn't wanna go, who the hell do you think you are to force her to go? Your brother was coming, that should have been enough. If his child isn't comfortable going without the mother there, that truly sucks, but she is not obligated to attend. Maybe you could have promised the child some candy or a gift if they'd come, since it's such a big occasion.", "obviously yta. she has never been rude to you, she just has anxiety, which is terrible to live with, by the way. she politely let you know she will not be able to come and you immediately called her a stuck up bitch. if i was her i would never come over again.", "Yta\nMaybe you should stop being a judgemental bitch...I can see why she wouldn't want to spend time with you. \nYour parents are also to blame... Instead of fostering this toxic environment where you guys talk behind their backs maybe they should have had a conversation with him when it 1st started happening.", "YTA\n\nYou're absolutely the AH!!! That is so rude and ignorant!", "YTA and you made sure she has good reason to never see your family again.", "Yta. Nothing you described sounds stuck up. Only that she is quiet and introverted. She has a life outside of her in-laws. She doesn\u2019t need to make you her priority.", "YTA.  She dislikes your family, she is fully willing to disappoint your brother to avoid you all.  That was your only leverage, and you and mom threw it away.\n\nNow Dobby is free and it is all your fault.  She never has to force herself to see any of you again.  Worth it?  For her yes, you handed her a bitchin' present ya fool.", "Yikes. Hard YTA. Just because you don't understand social anxiety doesn't mean she doesn't have it or that you're allowed to call your SIL names. In fact, all you've done is alienate her further.", "YTA you and your family sound like a nightmare.", "YTA. JFC are you the asshole. SIL has social anxiety, do you not listen! You can forget her attending any more events and likely not your brother or niece either because you're a compassionless jerk. Apologies are unlikely to fix this because who would believe you.", "YTA\n\nYou should apologize.\n\nCalling her names was unnecessary.\n\nThis woman does not like her husband's family.  She has dealt with it by not showing up, but allowing her husband and daughter to attend.\n\nSmooth things over so your brother and niece will attend the birthday celebration.  This is about your dad's happiness on his birthday, not you - or your mother.\n\nGood Luck", "YTA. She was polite and you escalated that beyond the point of no return. You do realize that you have absolutely vindicated her from ever seeing you or bringing your niece around again, right? You sound hostile and inappropriate and she can always refer back to that weird 0 to 60 text. Your brother understands that she is introverted, with a low social battery, and he respects that. Why can\u2019t you? Answer: You don\u2019t like or care about her. So, why should she hang out with you again?\n\nYour father does not deserve a command performance. Your brother will visit when he is able to, as will your niece. Accept that.", "Gee I wonder why she doesn't like you guys!", "Wow.  YTA.  She - for whatever reason - doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around your family.  She sounds very shy and large families can make introverts extremely uncomfortable.  But I fail to see how she\u2019s a \u201cstuck up B****\u201d, nor how her not attending the gathering will diminish it in any way, especially since she\u2019s more of an acquaintance.  Your brother was coming, that should be the most important thing.  You lashed out at her for no good reason except to be mean and ugly.  You should apologize, but be aware that this is probably the final straw for her.  Don\u2019t expect to ever see her again.  I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t care, but still something to be aware of.", "ESH. You suck for calling your SIL a bitch and based on your comments and post so does your SIL and brother.  Your SIL may be shy and introverted but what happens when her child graduates or is getting married or there is a death in the family? How does she handle work? If her social anxiety is so bad she needs to get help!\n\nYour brother also sucks. Despite knowing his father doesn't have much time left he hardly makes any effort for your father. Yes he is married and his wife and daughter comes first but that is also his father.", "YTA.\n\nThem: \"My wife has social anxiety and just doesn't enjoy being around people a lot, but I'm still coming to events fairly often, and I often bring our daughter with me.\"\n\nYou: \"Your wife is a stuck-up b\\*tch with no reason to avoid our family gatherings.\"\n\nThem: ...\n\nYou: \"So, I hope now that I've insulted your wife, you'll all be attending more events!\"\n\nThem: \"Actually, the opposite...\"\n\nYou: \"WWWWHHHHAT? Where is this coming from?\"", "YTA\n\nShe is introverted and shy. Your brother already told you so. You are just a gruff, selfish asshole completely lacking self awareness. Get over yourself.\n\nShe is polite and quiet when she is present. But she does not enjoy these get togethers. She does not alienate your brother. She does not gatekeep her daughter. She makes no demands of you or your extended family. She just doesn't enjoy your company and has enough respect to decline with grace. Follow her lead and mind your business.", "Not even sure I needed to read past the title.\n\nYTA", "I won't come to your family events either. You sound unhinged and extremely rude. YTA", "YTA.\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? And who, exactly, do you think you are to say something like that to her?\n\n> my mom thinks I did the right thing.\n\nOf course, she probably shares your sentiment and feels SIL has \"stolen\" her baby.", "YTA\nI get that you\u2019ve tried to have a close relationship with her and you weren\u2019t able to build one . But they doesn\u2019t mean you get to insult her. The way it\u2019s told you escalated the situation to the nth degree by calling her a stuck  up bitch . \nSometimes you\u2019re just not close with certain members of your family. And that\u2019s ok. But if you want to maintain a relationship with your brother and your niece you\u2019re gonna have to apologize. That\u2019s your brothers wife and your nieces mom.", "Yta you could have talk to her saying that this was a very important event due to dads poor health and age. That you understand that she may not be comfortable with alot of people around. But you all would be thankful and appreciate it if she could try. Attacking her only enforced her belief to stay away.", "YTA I wouldn\u2019t want to go on a weekend trip with my in-laws and I actually love them. I can\u2019t imagine why on earth she\u2019d want to go anywhere with the likes of you.", "YTA. I simply can't think why she doesn't want to spend time with you or your family. You sound so nice. \n\nNEVER call a woman a b*tch. You've been told she has social anxiety and she was still polite even after you pushed it. AH", "Yes, you are the asshole. You've been given the reason she doesn't attend (anxiety, introvert). It sounds like she's never forced your brother to not attend for her, but actually encourages him to go. You don't get to decide what she should attend.  Good job alienating your brother. YOU are the one who made him stand with his wife due to your utter nastiness to her.", "YTA - Way to ensure that you *don\u2019t* fix the problem. Also - you really need to check to make sure that you aren\u2019t the problem in the first place. Your brother - i.e., the person who would know - says his wife has social anxiety. Why aren\u2019t you accepting this explanation? Why do you insist that she\u2019s stuck up?", "Wow. You'd be welcomed with open arms by my family who doesn't have a damn clue what social anxiety is all about. I am so glad your brother has his wife's back. YTA along with the rest of the lot that sides with you.", "YTA. Who on earth do you think you are to speak to someone like that?! She was perfectly polite and civil. You absolutely should apologise and your mother needs to wise up if she thinks your behaviour was right.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH. You\u2019re the AH for the way you spoke to your SIL, you should never speak to someone that way. However, your SIL is also the AH for bailing on an important family even last minute and stopping her daughter from joining you.", "YTA. \n\nAs your brother said, his wife has social anxiety. You\u2019ve now further alienated her by calling her a \u201cstuck up b*tch.\u201d I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want to go to a family gathering after being called that.", "YTA.  Presumably she doesn't come around because you've got such a bad attitude.", "YTA.  How dare someone not do what you want them to do?  Doesn't your SIL know that when you say \"jump,\" she is supposed to respond, \"how high?\"  So, your mouth caused your brother to not attend his own father's 70th birthday party?  Congratulations!  You won!  Feel better now.", ">my mom thinks I did the right thing.\n\nShe's wrong.\n\nYTA and you know it. JFC.", "YTA.

ITs one thing to be introverted but keeping a man away from his family is gross.", "Might get downvoted but nta\nShe is acting like sucking it up for one event is so hard. Hell they don\u2019t even have to stay long. I would tell your mom to write off your brother( go no contact for holidays, Christmas, hell even the will). If they want the perks of being in the family act like it.", "Yta\nAs someone with severe anxiety, socially among other types, you\u2019re definitely in the wrong.

Your parents will likely see your nieces very infrequently in the future, because I certainly wouldn\u2019t expose my child to a hostile environment.\n\nAnd if your mom actually agrees with you, your brother has excellent reasons to cut off contact to protect his family.", "YTA. She is not REQUIRED to attend anything. If she can't handle lots of people, so what. You don't get to decide how they spend their time. \n\nMake sure you explain to your mom, that you calling her a bitch and refusing to apologize will be the reason no one sees them on holidays.

She has social anxiety, and you definitely just guaranteed that any reservations she had about attending future gatherings have been cemented in her mind.", "YTA.  You cannot possibly know the truth here, yet you decided this is all SIL's fault, and that her motives are bad.  That's not okay.\n\nMy advice is, call her back and admit you don't know anything other than seeing your parents be disappointed upsets you so much, you felt moved to try to step into her and force her to do what they want.\n\nYou admit this was wrong, caused pain and distress and you are very, very sorry.  That from here on out you will own your relationship with SIL, and let go of attempts to coerce her on your parents' behalf.", "YTA.

Social gatherings exhaust me and make me feel uncomfortable, so I don't go to many.  Being an introvert is NOT being a \"stuck up btch\".

I can see why she doesn't like being around your family.", "YTA.\nShe married your brother, not the entire family.\nNever forget this and change your attitude because otherwise you\u2019ll loose your brother who, thankfully, he\u2019s choosing his wife over a family of entitles brats.", "YTA.

She\u2019s invited SIL to do things that OP likes but that SIL has expressed she doesn\u2019t enjoy.  Has OP ever bothered to find out what SIL enjoys doing and invite her to do that?  I doubt it.", "OR, accept that SIL is legitimately suffering from an anxiety disorder that makes parties like that almost unbearable, and accept that she can\u2019t go.", "Maybe she knows the OP and her mom are judgmental, rude, assholes and that's why she doesn't want to spend time with them?  The OP has given NO reason to disbelieve the SIL is an introvert with social anxiety, she's just decided that it's not true and that her SIL is stuck up.

I\u2019ve just asked my brother once or twice if she could come, that too only when it was clear that her not attending would mean my brother not attending too. \nMy dad\u2019s health hasn\u2019t been the greatest these days, and he wanted to meet everyone from the family this birthday because he thinks he doesn\u2019t have much time left.

You sound like one of those people who doesn't know what the words you use mean. And while that's definitely hella embarrassing for you, it's 100% a you problem caused by your own voluntary ignorance. \n\nIn other words, I don't think anyone but you and your mommy feel confused about why people don't like hanging out with you.

I\u2019ll apologise to her. I was way out of the line talking to her like that.", "You\u2019re trying to justify your behavior.", "And instead of having an adult conversation with brother and SIL, in an attempt to understand, you acted like a mean teenager. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to be around you either", "I\u2019ve realised I was wrong.

Have you ever tried talking to her or asking her to come over just you and her just to try and get to know her or just going over to their place for a low key dinner or something?  I know for me large family gatherings can be intimidating and intense. Maybe if you approached this situation from one of more kindness and understanding of how hard it is for her in these social settings it might make her feel more comfortable.", "YTA - I see where you've agreed your comment was out of line and you're going to apologize to her. I would also apologize to your brother, and maybe even a kid friendly apology to your niece. \n\nTo offer you another perspective, I have an SO, and their family is wonderful. They're all kind and warm, and welcomed me into the family from day one. I love all of them. But, sometimes I don't go to their family activities, and if i do, im still really quiet and just sit off to the side. It's nothing against them. I am very introverted, anxious, and have some other things that affect my mood or my energy levels. I have to work myself up to be able to be around people, try to be extroverted, or not get overwhelmed by everyone talking or kids being around. It can be really exhausting for me, and it's hard for me to relax because of my anxiety. Sometimes, I have to literally hold onto my SO the entire time so I don't tip over the edge. Again, I love all of them, and all of them (to my knowledge) love me. It's nothing personal.\n\nTheir family has another in-law who doesn't go to all/most of the events either. No one at the gatherings judge them for it. \n\nAnother thing to remember is that yes, while your SIL did marry into your family and is a part of it, it's still not fully HER family. The expectations and obligations of her in the family shouldn't be held to the same standard you hold your immediate family to. It's great if that's what happens, but it's also ok if it doesn't. She's not being mean about it or slagging you all off, she has bad anxiety and has to take breaks. \n\nAnd the way your mom and you spoke about it, sounds like this has been something that's come up and been judged before in your side of the family. It does make me wonder if the environment or knowledge of it makes her anxiety even worse. It also makes me wonder if you guys have ganged up on or pestered your brother about it, to the point where the stress and exhaustion is rubbing off on him and your niece.", "YTA. I hope your brother goes NC with you over this.", "I can see why your SIL doesn't want to be around you.\n\nYTA.", "YTA and why don't you stop being a stuck up B for once and apologize since it would mean a lot to your dad if his son was there!", "ESH. \n\nI actually empathize with OP. Over the last five years, they\u2019ve watched their brother become more and more estranged from their family. His absence from their lives is breaking their parents\u2019 hearts, and they\u2019re the one witnessing their sorrow, not their brother, so they\u2019re probably angry, frustrated, and feeling helpless to fix the situation, so they let their emotions get the best of them. It\u2019s not an excuse for their poor behavior, but it does add context. \n\nThe SIL is terrible, too, because she doesn\u2019t seem to be able to make adequate concessions to allow OP and their family to spend important moments with their brother and niece. \n\nLet\u2019s be real, if SIL wasn\u2019t married to OP\u2019s brother, no one would give two hoots about her. And vice versa. However, both OP and their family and SIL should love OP\u2019s brother enough to suck it up and tolerate each other so he doesn\u2019t have to essentially choose one family over the other. \n\nOP, you need to apologize for what you SAID; you were wrong. However, you don\u2019t have to apologize for how you FEEL. I\u2019m a firm believer that people should never apologize for their feelings, because all feelings are valid. \n\nAfter you apologize to your SIL, talk to your brother. Request a sit-down conversation with him and your SIL. Lay it all out on the line. Let them know that you and your family miss him and your niece. Ask if you, or your family, have ever done anything to SIL to make her feel excluded or uncomfortable (last text message notwithstanding), and what you can do to rectify the situation. Ask her what you guys can do to be able to see more of your brother and niece, because since they\u2019re a family unit, you don\u2019t expect him to be comfortable going places without her, but you want him in your lives. Put the ball in her court. \n\nIf your brother sees how much you guys miss him, and that you\u2019re putting forth an earnest effort to accommodate his wife, if she\u2019s still unyielding, he may be more inclined to visit more often without her, since it would become clear that she\u2019s being unreasonable. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA X10!!!  You don't make other people's decisions for them. Your brother has explained that she has social anxiety.   Your brother is a soft AH for missing your dads 70th to punish you. You need to apologize!", "YTA\n\nim still looking for the \"stuck up\" part but it seems like you're just an asshole\ud83e\udd71", "YTA\n\nSocial anxiety is a very real thing. Anxiety can be crippling, it's nothing to do with being stuck up, she can't help it.", "YTA.  You have been told she has social anxiety, yet you VSP her derogatory names because she doesn\u2019t do what you want.  She is her own person and owes you nothing.  No wonder your brother doesn\u2019t go to family events as much.  He has probably noticed how horribly his family behaves and doesn\u2019t want any of your behavior to rub off on his child.", "So your SIL has a social anxiety disorder, and your family's response when she attends family events is to... Crowd around her and hit her with a barrage of questions?\n\nI mean, take what you said to her out of the equation and your family is already TA. Of course this woman doesn't want to be around you guys when you disregard her condition every single time she's around you.\n\nAdd on your comment to her and YTA with bells on.", "Obviously YTA for your reaction when she has actually done nothing wrong.  But I do understand the frustration of someone not showing up, especially to these big milestone events.  Add to that the emotion of a loved one getting on in years and the paranoia that this time could very well be the last time.  You need to apologize and sit down with each other to explain your feelings and why this is so important to you and the family.  What is her urgent thing?  Is there anything that can be done to reach a compromise?  Maybe suggest to dad, brother, and SIL to have a private dinner together for dad's birthday?  Maybe they can bring niece or you can offer to watch her to free them for the evening.  Just make as easy as possible for SIL.  It can be frustrating to offer that much for someone you feel isn't pulling their weight, but sometimes the extra effort goes a long way to creating a bridge neither of you realized you needed.  It may depend on whether or not the relationship with your brother is worth it.", "YTA. Obviously, you don't think that social anxiety is a big deal, but it actually is and, depending on how severe it is, it can be really terrifying for a person to interact with other people. And it's really difficult to overcome it, some people never manage to do it. You owe an apology to your sister-in-law AND to your brother for offending his wife.", "YTA. \n\nNot everyone likes to attend big family get togethers. My in-laws always make comments about me not attending theirs. But they fail to take into consideration that i don't like to attend family get togethers with my own family.

She doesn't stop your brother from coming around; it's quite possible your attitude is doing that, your parents' too if they feel the same as you. She doesn't come to gatherings because she doesn't feel comfortable. She doesn't want to shop because it means *going out in public* when she has an anxiety made worse by *being* out in public. Have you ever thought about one on one time at home? Like a movie night or something? Have you tried to be understanding of her point of view? Do you know what it is like to have social anxiety? An anxiety disorder in general? If not, you have no idea how much stress she puts herself under to appear at the family functions she has.", "Yeah that was a bit much.

Why doesn't she just suck it up and be brave for a few hours? You know, like every other introverted person used to do, until about 5 minutes ago, when people somehow decided being introverted was some kind of disability that should be coddled instead of battled?\n\nI've been painfully shy and introverted my entire life. I would never dream of bailing on every social event with distant/extended family just because it's not a fun time for me. I'm expected there, and the family I AM close with would be hurt if I didn't go. So I put on a brave face and I go. Because sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do. Because family comes with certain obligations. And because it's childish to allow your life to be ruled by your fears and weaknesses.\n\nBeing introverted is not a disability, nor is it wholly immutable. You can't change yourself into an extrovert, but, with practice, you CAN become more outgoing and more comfortable in social situations. Getting jobs in customer service (retail and restaurants) where I was forced to talk to people all day helped enormously. \n\nI'm just so tired of introverts pretending that they are helpless: \"Oh, well I'm an introvert, so I can't go to parties!\" Yes you can. You are choosing not to. No one's saying it's not hard for you, but you are making a choice not to put in the work.\n\nESH, by the way.

But, the way you want it to happen, does not take their needs or desires into consideration. If you want to be in their life, and have them be in yours, and care about them so much, you need to meet them where they're at. It's not fair to try and force them into your life, and force them to do it ways they're not comfortable with.", "10/10", "I agree with you to some extent about introverts being too quick to use introversion as an excuse.

It sounds like his family is big on getting together all the time, which some people (like me) would find exhausting. There\u2019s nothing wrong with hubby going by himself to events.\n\nAlso, they have a young child.
