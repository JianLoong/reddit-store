On the handful of occasions she\u2019s attended our family gatherings, she\u2019s been very reserved and quiet, giving one word answers or just smiling whenever someone tries to strike up a conversation. Mostly she makes some excuse and just doesn\u2019t show up.\n\nBecause of this, my brother has also stopped attending the family gatherings as much as before. My parents are very disappointed with this and my brother\u2019s absence makes them visibly upset. I\u2019ve asked my brother about it, and he\u2019s always maintained that SIL is very introverted and has social anxiety and that he\u2019s not gonna force her into doing something she doesn\u2019t like.\n\nNext week is our dad\u2019s 70th birthday and ofc, my brother and his family are invited. This is supposed to be a grand event with all of our extended family going on a weekend trip. Yesterday, SIL texted me saying that she won\u2019t be coming for the trip. The conversation went something like this: \n\nSIL: Hey,I\u2019m so sorry but something urgent has come up and I won\u2019t be able to attend the event. It\u2019s gonna be only (my brother). \n\nMe : At least (niece) is coming, right?\n\nSIL : Oh I would love for her to attend but she\u2019s saying that she won\u2019t attend without me.\n\nMe: Then why don\u2019t you stop being a stuck up b*tch for once and attend the event since it would mean a lot to my dad if the entire family was there!\n\nSIL didn\u2019t respond after that. Few mins later I got a call from my brother and he was furious.  He said that the way I talked to his wife was very disrespectful and that he will not be coming for the trip until I apologise. I refused to apologise because I felt this was long overdue. So now brother isn\u2019t coming for the trip.  My dad thinks I should apologise but my mom thinks I did the right thing. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677086732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1195jq5/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_wife_that_she_is_a/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I called my SIL a stuck up bitch because she\u2019s refused to attend any of our family events for the past five years, even tho we\u2019ve been nothing but welcoming, and she refused to attend my dad\u2019s 70th birthday event causing her daughter to not wanna attend too.

At least your brother has his priorities right and put you in your place.", "YTA. \u201cStuck up bitch\u201d is your narrative about what\u2019s going on - you have ZERO proof that she is, in fact, stuck up. Social anxiety could be one plausible reason. Not liking your family and drawing reasonable boundaries to keep the peace is another. \n\nMy friends and I were once called \u201cstuck up\u201d because we didn\u2019t go to a party. But we didn\u2019t go not because we were stuck up, but because our coach didn\u2019t allow us to. It\u2019s real easy for people to form unwarranted narratives about other people in their heads.", "YTA\n\nShe has social anxiety and your response is to insult her? I get your disappointment, but you've just made it less likely your brother will show up. My family includes people with anxiety and we warmly welcome them when they're able to show up and don't push them away through insults and assumptions about their motivation.", "YTA, completely. If she has social anxiety or some other mental health thing going on, family gatherings with people she doesn\u2019t know very well can be very stressful. Or maybe she just doesn\u2019t like you. Either way, she doesn\u2019t owe you or your family her time, especially since she\u2019s not stopping her husband or niece from attending things. And what you did definitely doesn\u2019t help in any way and has now alienated your brother, so good job there. She also doesn\u2019t owe you or your family an explanation. Your brother is fine with the situation, so you should\u2019ve just backed off. \n\nI\u2019m a shy introvert with general anxiety. When I first meet new people, I\u2019m quiet and reserved (but polite). I can\u2019t help it, it\u2019s who I am, but many people have told me they thought I was a \u201cstuck up bitch\u201d after I open up more. That\u2019s their problem, not mine. And your attitude towards your SIL is your problem, not hers. Get over it.", "YTA. That was totally uncalled for.", "YTA. You could've just asked at any point why she doesn't feel like coming to things rather than exploding like an asshole. And if you did already asked and she was non-committal, take the hint and leave her alone. Having social anxiety doesn't make you a stuck up bitch. Expecting people to cater to you and attend things because you want them to then calling them names makes you the stuck up bitch.", "YTA. I\u2019m very glad your brother has her back on this one because damn, you and your mother don\u2019t sound as welcoming as you\u2019re portraying yourselves to be.", "I\u2019m introverted and have social anxiety as well. It is exhausting and causes a whole host of other issues to go to social gatherings. I feel for her. Moreover, with the way you spoke to her I\u2019m sure there are other reasons as to why she doesn\u2019t want to be around you or your family.", "Having social anxiety is not being stuck up or rude. She doesn\u2019t have to go. Calling someone names is rude, however, so yeah YTA", "YTA  \n\n\nIf she doesn't wanna go, who the hell do you think you are to force her to go? Your brother was coming, that should have been enough. If his child isn't comfortable going without the mother there, that truly sucks, but she is not obligated to attend. Maybe you could have promised the child some candy or a gift if they'd come, since it's such a big occasion.", "obviously yta. she has never been rude to you, she just has anxiety, which is terrible to live with, by the way. she politely let you know she will not be able to come and you immediately called her a stuck up bitch. if i was her i would never come over again.", "Yta\nMaybe you should stop being a judgemental bitch...I can see why she wouldn't want to spend time with you. \nYour parents are also to blame... Instead of fostering this toxic environment where you guys talk behind their backs maybe they should have had a conversation with him when it 1st started happening.", "YTA\n\nYou're absolutely the AH!!! That is so rude and ignorant!", "YTA and you made sure she has good reason to never see your family again.", "Yta. Nothing you described sounds stuck up. Only that she is quiet and introverted. She has a life outside of her in-laws. She doesn\u2019t need to make you her priority.", "YTA.  She dislikes your family, she is fully willing to disappoint your brother to avoid you all.  That was your only leverage, and you and mom threw it away.\n\nNow Dobby is free and it is all your fault.  She never has to force herself to see any of you again.  Worth it?  For her yes, you handed her a bitchin' present ya fool.", "Yikes. Hard YTA. Just because you don't understand social anxiety doesn't mean she doesn't have it or that you're allowed to call your SIL names. In fact, all you've done is alienate her further.", "YTA you and your family sound like a nightmare.", "YTA. JFC are you the asshole. SIL has social anxiety, do you not listen! You can forget her attending any more events and likely not your brother or niece either because you're a compassionless jerk. Apologies are unlikely to fix this because who would believe you.", "YTA\n\nYou should apologize.\n\nCalling her names was unnecessary.\n\nThis woman does not like her husband's family.  She has dealt with it by not showing up, but allowing her husband and daughter to attend.\n\nSmooth things over so your brother and niece will attend the birthday celebration.  This is about your dad's happiness on his birthday, not you - or your mother.\n\nGood Luck", "YTA. She was polite and you escalated that beyond the point of no return. You do realize that you have absolutely vindicated her from ever seeing you or bringing your niece around again, right? You sound hostile and inappropriate and she can always refer back to that weird 0 to 60 text. Your brother understands that she is introverted, with a low social battery, and he respects that. Why can\u2019t you? Answer: You don\u2019t like or care about her. So, why should she hang out with you again?\n\nYour father does not deserve a command performance. Your brother will visit when he is able to, as will your niece. Accept that.", "Gee I wonder why she doesn't like you guys!", "Wow.  YTA.  She - for whatever reason - doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around your family.  She sounds very shy and large families can make introverts extremely uncomfortable.  But I fail to see how she\u2019s a \u201cstuck up B****\u201d, nor how her not attending the gathering will diminish it in any way, especially since she\u2019s more of an acquaintance.  Your brother was coming, that should be the most important thing.  You lashed out at her for no good reason except to be mean and ugly.  You should apologize, but be aware that this is probably the final straw for her.  Don\u2019t expect to ever see her again.  I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t care, but still something to be aware of.", "ESH. You suck for calling your SIL a bitch and based on your comments and post so does your SIL and brother.  Your SIL may be shy and introverted but what happens when her child graduates or is getting married or there is a death in the family? How does she handle work? If her social anxiety is so bad she needs to get help!\n\nYour brother also sucks. Despite knowing his father doesn't have much time left he hardly makes any effort for your father. Yes he is married and his wife and daughter comes first but that is also his father.", "YTA.\n\nThem: \"My wife has social anxiety and just doesn't enjoy being around people a lot, but I'm still coming to events fairly often, and I often bring our daughter with me.\"\n\nYou: \"Your wife is a stuck-up b\\*tch with no reason to avoid our family gatherings.\"\n\nThem: ...\n\nYou: \"So, I hope now that I've insulted your wife, you'll all be attending more events!\"\n\nThem: \"Actually, the opposite...\"\n\nYou: \"WWWWHHHHAT? Where is this coming from?\"", "YTA\n\nShe is introverted and shy. Your brother already told you so. You are just a gruff, selfish asshole completely lacking self awareness. Get over yourself.\n\nShe is polite and quiet when she is present. But she does not enjoy these get togethers. She does not alienate your brother. She does not gatekeep her daughter. She makes no demands of you or your extended family. She just doesn't enjoy your company and has enough respect to decline with grace. Follow her lead and mind your business.", "Not even sure I needed to read past the title.\n\nYTA", "I won't come to your family events either. You sound unhinged and extremely rude. YTA", "YTA.\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? And who, exactly, do you think you are to say something like that to her?\n\n> my mom thinks I did the right thing.\n\nOf course, she probably shares your sentiment and feels SIL has \"stolen\" her baby.", "YTA\nI get that you\u2019ve tried to have a close relationship with her and you weren\u2019t able to build one . But they doesn\u2019t mean you get to insult her. The way it\u2019s told you escalated the situation to the nth degree by calling her a stuck  up bitch . \nSometimes you\u2019re just not close with certain members of your family. And that\u2019s ok. But if you want to maintain a relationship with your brother and your niece you\u2019re gonna have to apologize. That\u2019s your brothers wife and your nieces mom.", "Yta you could have talk to her saying that this was a very important event due to dads poor health and age. That you understand that she may not be comfortable with alot of people around. But you all would be thankful and appreciate it if she could try. Attacking her only enforced her belief to stay away.", "YTA I wouldn\u2019t want to go on a weekend trip with my in-laws and I actually love them. I can\u2019t imagine why on earth she\u2019d want to go anywhere with the likes of you.", "YTA. I simply can't think why she doesn't want to spend time with you or your family. You sound so nice. \n\nNEVER call a woman a b*tch. You've been told she has social anxiety and she was still polite even after you pushed it. AH", "Yes, you are the asshole. You've been given the reason she doesn't attend (anxiety, introvert). It sounds like she's never forced your brother to not attend for her, but actually encourages him to go. You don't get to decide what she should attend.  Good job alienating your brother. YOU are the one who made him stand with his wife due to your utter nastiness to her.", "YTA - Way to ensure that you *don\u2019t* fix the problem. Also - you really need to check to make sure that you aren\u2019t the problem in the first place. Your brother - i.e., the person who would know - says his wife has social anxiety. Why aren\u2019t you accepting this explanation? Why do you insist that she\u2019s stuck up?", "Wow. You'd be welcomed with open arms by my family who doesn't have a damn clue what social anxiety is all about. I am so glad your brother has his wife's back. YTA along with the rest of the lot that sides with you.", "YTA. Who on earth do you think you are to speak to someone like that?! She was perfectly polite and civil. You absolutely should apologise and your mother needs to wise up if she thinks your behaviour was right.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH. You\u2019re the AH for the way you spoke to your SIL, you should never speak to someone that way. However, your SIL is also the AH for bailing on an important family even last minute and stopping her daughter from joining you.", "YTA. \n\nAs your brother said, his wife has social anxiety. You\u2019ve now further alienated her by calling her a \u201cstuck up b*tch.\u201d I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want to go to a family gathering after being called that.", "YTA.  Presumably she doesn't come around because you've got such a bad attitude.", "YTA.  How dare someone not do what you want them to do?  Doesn't your SIL know that when you say \"jump,\" she is supposed to respond, \"how high?\"  So, your mouth caused your brother to not attend his own father's 70th birthday party?  Congratulations!  You won!  Feel better now.", ">my mom thinks I did the right thing.\n\nShe's wrong.\n\nYTA and you know it. JFC.", "YTA.

ITs one thing to be introverted but keeping a man away from his family is gross.", "Might get downvoted but nta\nShe is acting like sucking it up for one event is so hard. Hell they don\u2019t even have to stay long. I would tell your mom to write off your brother( go no contact for holidays, Christmas, hell even the will). If they want the perks of being in the family act like it.", "Yta\nAs someone with severe anxiety, socially among other types, you\u2019re definitely in the wrong.

Your parents will likely see your nieces very infrequently in the future, because I certainly wouldn\u2019t expose my child to a hostile environment.\n\nAnd if your mom actually agrees with you, your brother has excellent reasons to cut off contact to protect his family.", "YTA. She is not REQUIRED to attend anything. If she can't handle lots of people, so what. You don't get to decide how they spend their time. \n\nMake sure you explain to your mom, that you calling her a bitch and refusing to apologize will be the reason no one sees them on holidays.

I am willing to be you and your family\u2019s unpleasantness is why your brother and his wife don\u2019t really like hanging out with y\u2019all.

She has social anxiety, and you definitely just guaranteed that any reservations she had about attending future gatherings have been cemented in her mind.", "YTA.  You cannot possibly know the truth here, yet you decided this is all SIL's fault, and that her motives are bad.  That's not okay.\n\nMy advice is, call her back and admit you don't know anything other than seeing your parents be disappointed upsets you so much, you felt moved to try to step into her and force her to do what they want.\n\nYou admit this was wrong, caused pain and distress and you are very, very sorry.  That from here on out you will own your relationship with SIL, and let go of attempts to coerce her on your parents' behalf.", "YTA.

Social gatherings exhaust me and make me feel uncomfortable, so I don't go to many.  Being an introvert is NOT being a \"stuck up btch\".

She laid a boundary in a very polite manner, you disrespected that. I can see why she doesn't like being around your family.", "YTA.\nShe married your brother, not the entire family.\nNever forget this and change your attitude because otherwise you\u2019ll loose your brother who, thankfully, he\u2019s choosing his wife over a family of entitles brats.", "YTA.

You should really be mad at your brother who what\u2019s every ability to go but is refusing to do so.", "Wait so you call her a stuck up and refused to apologize when she was being nice and said something urgent came up and now when they ask for a apology or they won\u2019t come you won\u2019t apologize after just saying that your dad wants the whole family there. OP you are the most shittiest person in that family. YTA", "I understand exactly what you mean. I'm an introvert and have social anxiety. I've been called \"stuck up\" or \"ice queen\". People who get to know me know I'm the opposite but a lot of people, especially outgoing people, don't make the effort bc I'm not like them. I get anxiety thinking about spending time with my own family and friends! Almost always, I enjoy the get together or an event but the anticipation of it is always hell. I always say, if there weren't introverts, who would ever listen to the extroverts? They'd all be talking and no one would be listening.", "Hopefully this will be the trigger that results in NC so she can stop being harassed by all of them. It sounds like they are all against her, which makes it 1000x's worse to attend anything, knowing they don't like you.", "Op seems delightful I'm amazed sil isn't at the opening of every bag,  envelope or other event with op and her family. Is it possible.., could it be....that op is the reason sil doesn't attend?", "It really wouldn't matter if the SIL had social anxiety or not.  She is under no obligation to give any reason for turning down an invitation.", " \n\nIt's really easy for people to create unrealistic narratives about other people in their heads.", "I\u2019m honestly baffled after typing out this entire story OP could come to any conclusion other than being the asshole. \n\nSIL clearly doesn\u2019t like being around OP and OP\u2019s family, but is willing to try on occasion yet is still ridiculed and told it\u2019s not enough. \n\nI don\u2019t know when people will realize that you are not entitled to ANYONES time or life. SIL doesn\u2019t like you. So why would niece be around you? Or your toxic parents who allow this treatment and behavior?", "It might not even be that she dislikes them (though she probably does now lol) \n\nI have social anxiety and am neurodivergent and I get overwhelmed in crowds, even if it\u2019s people I enjoy 1 on 1. \n\nA huge traveling family festival sounds like a nightmare to me.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so bad she can\u2019t ever go out, only that she doesn\u2019t push herself when it isn\u2019t necessary. Maybe instead of spending her free time with in-laws she prefers to relax at home? Why is that so bad. They aren\u2019t owed her presence", "OP hasn\u2019t though.  She\u2019s invited SIL to do things that OP likes but that SIL has expressed she doesn\u2019t enjoy.  Has OP ever bothered to find out what SIL enjoys doing and invite her to do that?  I doubt it.", "OR, accept that SIL is legitimately suffering from an anxiety disorder that makes parties like that almost unbearable, and accept that she can\u2019t go.", "Maybe she knows the OP and her mom are judgmental, rude, assholes and that's why she doesn't want to spend time with them?  The OP has given NO reason to disbelieve the SIL is an introvert with social anxiety, she's just decided that it's not true and that her SIL is stuck up. I wouldn't want to spend time with these people either, if that's how they treat people who are supposedly family. \n\nAlso, reading is fundamental...... did you miss the part where it's a weekend trip?  Not like they could just show up for a couple hours \ud83d\ude44", "If I had to spend even one event per year with these AHs I would move to Tierra del Fuego so I didn't have to. Hope they do move abroad. No one would call my partner insults like that and expect to see me again.", "For real, I\u2019m sure SIL gets vibes that they all hate her.", "Right.. talking about going from 0 to 100.. if OP's parents are anything like this then I don't blame SIL for not wanting to come around.  YTA OP", "If I was the SIL and I was willing to come to 6-7 family events in the past, I certainly wouldn't be willing to in the future.  \n\n\nBig YTA energy.", "Bingo.", "And the OP will go to her grave believing she was right.", "I think it\u2019s a cultural thing I guess? We\u2019re Indians and it\u2019s custom for us to have a family get together on our festivals. Everyone gets together and celebrates. And it\u2019s not like we live in different cities, so 6-7 times in five years less than normal. My brother visits sometimes and I\u2019ve seen my niece a couple of times ever since she was born, but now that I think about it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met my SIL in 2 years.", "Exactly. I\u2019m like the SIL, shy and reserved with anxiety when I\u2019m around people I don\u2019t know well or feel comfortable around. I too have been called a \u201cstuck up bitch\u201d even though I\u2019m polite, just reserved.", "She wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m pretty sure OP and her fam think she\u2019s stuck up because she isn\u2019t comfortable hanging out with them.", "Whenever she\u2019s attended any family gatherings, she\u2019s always given one worded replies to people. Whenever someone\u2019s tried talking to her, or tried to involve her in the conversation so she doesn\u2019t feel left out, again, one word answers that close the prospect of any further conversation. \nAll through these five years, we\u2019ve always extended an invitation to her even though we know she\u2019ll not come. And that\u2019s fine with us. Not once have any of us said anything about this to her. I\u2019ve just asked my brother once or twice if she could come, that too only when it was clear that her not attending would mean my brother not attending too. \nMy dad\u2019s health hasn\u2019t been the greatest these days, and he wanted to meet everyone from the family this birthday because he thinks he doesn\u2019t have much time left. My brother and SIL know this. That\u2019s why I felt she should\u2019ve come this one time.", ">\tI always say, if there weren\u2019t introverts, who would ever listen to the extroverts? They\u2019d all be talking and no one would be listening.\n\nLol, exactly! I let them talk and talk if it makes them happy.", "Yup! I\u2019m sure it amplifies her anxiety. I\u2019m glad her husband is defending her, too. I feel like that\u2019s rare in this sub.", "I think it\u2019s hilarious that OP posted this thinking they were in the right", "Right? Like how can OP think it\u2019s okay to speak to someone like that? I\u2019m sure there is a ton more info she\u2019s leaving out here. I\u2019d love to hear the SIL\u2019s version of things\u2026", "Have you gone to visit her? Maybe she\u2019s more comfortable in her own environment. I know how frustrating this is. I have a very close family member who is pretty much agoraphobic. But I also have social anxiety so I understand it, to a point. \n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t care really to see her or your brother as much as you care that they keep up appearance.", "I know, I just want her to say it.", "The OP sounds like an old battleax that nobody would want to hangout with.", "It's obviously NOT fine with you given what you said and that your mom thinks you were right to say it.\n\nCan you seriously be surprised this woman doesn't feel comfortable opening up to people who would say stuff like what you said?", "So, instead of explaining any of that to her, you jumped straight from \"Is your daughter coming?\" to \"You're a stuck-up bitch\"?\n\nPlease respond, OP.", "Maybe she doesn't want to talk to you because - based on this story - you're all awful judgmental assholes? YTA", "That's still not stuck up behavior. You're one of those people that thinks shy people think theyre better than everyone else, dont you?\n\nAlso, your SIL reached out to you personally to tell you she couldn't make it due to something *urgent.* It's not her fault her daughter doesn't want to go without her. Why are you yelling at her that she should go just so your niece can? \n\nTBH *you* sound stuck up.", "She can do what she wants, and honestly it sounds like you aren\u2019t that great to be around. I wouldn\u2019t come either. An invitation is not a summons.", "What you felt is immaterial.   You don't get to decide what other people do.", "> And that\u2019s fine with us\n\nIt\u2019s clearly not fine, considering you\u2019re calling her a stuck up bitch.", "None of this is an excuse Yta", "I've read all your comments and you have yet to identify even one single instance of her being stuck up. You sound like one of those people who doesn't know what the words you use mean. And while that's definitely hella embarrassing for you, it's 100% a you problem caused by your own voluntary ignorance. \n\nIn other words, I don't think anyone but you and your mommy feel confused about why people don't like hanging out with you. You're sound like a miserable person!", "If this is how you treat someone with social anxiety than I'm impressed anyone wants to spend time with you or your family. You sound awful.", "I mean YTA, your SIL is kind of beside the issue and you attacking her is unfair. Your brother is choosing to not be with you guys. Just leave it. If he isn\u2019t invested in your family relationship, you can\u2019t force him. You don\u2019t have to waste your energy investing in a relationship with him or his family.  Enjoy YOUR time with your parents.", "As a formerly quiet person, it was interesting to see what people would read into my quietness. Some people thought I was stuck up, some thought I was serene, some thought I was smart and observant, some thought I was too dumb to have anything to say. Nothing you described shows that she thinks less of you, she\u2019s just quiet.\n\nBasically, the way you reacted to her says a great deal more about your assumptions and insecurities than anything else.", "Seriously. \"I was rude to someone, but AITA?\"  \n\n\nYes. YTA.", "Entitled, narcissistic people always think that way.", "Have explained the situation to them before. My brother knows dad\u2019s condition, and I had a talk with SIL last week where I told her I would be grateful if she attended given the situation and she said she most likely will. She told me she\u2019s not gonna come yesterday, which is Tuesday and we were supposed to leave for the trip on Thursday night.", "Kinda makes me think there's a reason the daughter doesn't want to go if the mother doesn't. These people sound like bullies, tbh.", "I kind of feel like this was posted by my narc MIL... \ud83e\udd23", ">I told her I would be grateful if she attended given the situation\n\n\"And if you don't, I'm going to scream at you and call you names.\" \n\nAnd you wonder why she doesn't want to hang out with you?", "Your brother is in charge of his relationship with his father, not you. He chooses where to put his energy.", "So this has happened like a thousand times in the past five years, and I\u2019ve never reacted like this. Never even said anything other than \u2018ok np\u2019. I\u2019m not trying to justify myself here, just that me and my fam aren\u2019t raging assholes who shout and scream at her for not attending events. \nI realise y\u2019all are right. I\u2019ll apologise to her. I was way out of the line talking to her like that.", "You\u2019re trying to justify your behavior.", "And instead of having an adult conversation with brother and SIL, in an attempt to understand, you acted like a mean teenager. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to be around you either", "I\u2019ve realised I was wrong. Not justifying anything", "You should sincerely apologize to your SIL. You should also apologize to the rest of your family - your comment to your SIL will make her less likely to come around. \n\nYou should accept that your one comment may have significantly fractured your relationship.", "I\u2019m not going to beat you up OP because I think you realize that you were wrong and absolutely need to apologize to SIL. You are absolutely allowed to feel disappointed and frustrated with the situation but you aren\u2019t allowed to call people names or be mean because of that. Have you ever tried talking to her or asking her to come over just you and her just to try and get to know her or just going over to their place for a low key dinner or something?  I know for me large family gatherings can be intimidating and intense. Maybe if you approached this situation from one of more kindness and understanding of how hard it is for her in these social settings it might make her feel more comfortable."]}
