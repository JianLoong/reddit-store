She also has a lot of cellulite and now varicose veins (this I feel runs in the family)\n\nEvery orthopedic doctor that we have visited said that she is over weight (188 lbs at 5\u20194\u201d) and must lose at least 35 lbs. She has body image issues and becomes conscious whenever we make love. She is also scared of wearing tighter fitting clothes that she earlier had no issues with.\n\nWe just got a full body checkup done and at 34, she has many parameters that are either over the limit of just on the cusp of it. Fasting glucose and creatinine levels etc. don\u2019t look good.\n\nShe is only cutting breakfast and eats little to lose weight and I have told her umpteen times that eating less will not help her lose weight if that\u2019s what she wants and that eating healthy and exercising is the way to go.\n\nOne part of her listens to this very objectively while the other half of her thinks I am either fat-shaming her or that I have lost interest in her after her weight gains and when I send her workout videos of Instagramers who tell you what they eat everyday or what exercises they do at home etc. she thinks I like \u201ctheir bodies\u201d so I \u201cshould go sleep with them\u201d. \n\nI love her from the bottom of my heart and I know she does all the house chores religiously and takes care of our kids etc. but she is neglecting her health big time and I am lost at how to make her change her lifestyle to help her become more healthy life.\n\nAITA for pushing her but in my mind I am doing it to help her lead a more healthy life.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI agree that while my intentions were good, I took the worse possible approach and agree that I am the asshole here <sigh>.\n\n1. I intend start taking her the gym with me so we both work lout together.\n\n2. No more junk food starting with this week.\n\n3. I help with doing the dishes and cleaning sporadically, but starting now, I will designate a few days of the week where I will do all chores.\n\n4. She has a cleanliness disorder, and anything I clean is inadequate, but I think the majority of what I do is acceptable.\n\n5. Going on long walks, hopefully this will help bond us even more and that she doesn\u2019t feel trapped and helpless.\n\n6. I have scheduled a general physician\u2019s appointment as step one and will do a step two with specialist/consultants for more detailed review of all her test results.\n\n7. Plan to visit a nutritionist for a curated diet plan that goes with the exercise and walking regime we plan to adopt together.\n\n8. To all SOs out there, don\u2019t be like me since now I realize that my shitty approach hasn\u2019t been of any use for years and my wife has never tried to correct me and this hurts me even more. If I could go back in time, I would do things so much more differently.\n\n9. Take it slow.

Stop talking about her body. Stop giving her advice, you don't know what you are talking about. \n- Ask about her mental health and feelings", "INFO: Have you asked her how you can help?", "YTA. How about scheduling an appointment with a licensed dietician instead of spouting vague nonsense? A good dietician can be a powerful and helpful ally in the journey to a healthier lifestyle. You keep talking about her losing weight, you make no mention of how she is going to maintain it when she does. You harping on her on it is not going to help her.", "YTA\n\nYou are going about this in the worst possible way! \n\n1. Don\u2019t send her Instagram fitness models!! Most of those people use filters/edit/use angles and lighting to look that way. It\u2019s not real even for the models! You sending her those as examples of what she \u201ccould\u201d look like is just cruel and again not often real/attainable. Also, a lot of those models were already thin before they started to pack on muscles/lean out more. Weight often has more to do with genetics/metabolism/hormones than just dieting and exercise. These fitness influencers are trying to to sell a product based off what worked for them, not for all/most. Also don\u2019t trust \u201cwhat I eat in a day videos\u201d. They are not nutritionists. Just don\u2019t take health/medical advice from social media in general. \n\n2. You want her to be more active, do it together or as a family. Don\u2019t put all the pressure on her to figure out when to fit exercise in when she has children to care for and a house to keep functioning! It\u2019s exhausting especially when your partner doesn\u2019t help equally (as you\u2019ve indicated in your post). And that\u2019s assuming she doesn\u2019t work outside of the home as well- that\u2019s a double whammy. Take walks together everyday. Make it part of your daily routine. You don\u2019t have to do cross fit or run marathons to be more active. Spending time together walking just the two of you or as a family is a way to encourage a healthier lifestyle together and not in an asshole way. Your want her to eat healthier meals, you take over cooking 3/4 nights a week. Make whatever healthy meal you want. She can take that time your cooking to for a walk or walk the kids to the park (if that\u2019s an option). Again, helping her with kindness, not judgment and pressure. \n\n3. There are medical ways to get her started with weight loss that she can discuss with an actual medical professional (not a Instagram model). I needed help with a \u201cjump\u201d start to get weight-loss going to help with fertility. I talked with my doctor and we together came up with a plan (3 months of a stimulant/appetite suppressant along with a nutritionist to create healthier habits- infertility and emotional eating are not a good mix). It worked really well for me any set me up for continued success once the medication cycle was completed. Give your wife helpful support and resources that she can use to achieve real, long lasting progress instead of added external pressure from the man who is suppose to be her safe person. This will just cause an unhealthy cycle of disordered eating. \n\n4. Just do better. Post from husbands in AITA always remind me how lucky I am with my husband. He does annoying shit, but he\u2019s never this dumb.", "I struggle with some of this too. Objectively I know that eating right and exercising is the way to go, but it\u2019s not always that easy when it comes time to make menu choices. \n\nWhat has been the most helpful to me is when my boyfriend says \u201chey let\u2019s get the small pizza to split, and we\u2019ll each get salads\u201d which makes me feel like I\u2019m not the only one making sacrifices, and I still get some of what I really want. \n\nIt\u2019s tricky. You can lead a horse to water, as they say.", "I am not concerned about your wife's weight. I am concerned about the borderline glucose and the elevated creatinine. Uncontrolled diabetes is the number 1 cause for kidney failure, followed closely by uncontrolled hypertension. If her creatine is elevated, she should probably see a nephrologist to be evaluated for CKD ( chronic kidney disease).There are small dietary changes she can make, medications she should avoid like ibuprofen/Motrin ( nsaids) which are processed by the kidneys and can do cumulative damage. There are medications to help with insulin resistance ( type 2 diabetes). Don't focus on her weight, focus on managing the metabolic problems that are developing. If you share this with your wife: Please do everything you can to stay out of one of my dialysis chairs.\n\nFocusing on weight loss for someone else, who hasn't asked you to be her nagging coach, is counterproductive. There are tons of programs and classes your wife can choose to do to become more physically active, and to eat more healthily. Her weight loss journey, if she chooses to undertake it, needs to be her own. She needs to make sure she is doing everything she can to manage her health problems. Catching these things early, allows her to make small changes to prevent future problems.", "Yta\n\nAs a woman with the same issues it's painful and so bloody hard to eat and exercise. Eating smaller meals is the smart way to shrinking the stomach, my doc recommended and we aren't in pain. I would love to exercise like my man does but I have slipped disc and OA. \n\nOP NEEDS TO STOP BEING A CONTROLLING AH", "Does she have time to take care of herself? Sounds like she\u2019s taking care of everybody else first, give her time to relax without taking care of others so she has time to do that and take care of herself.", "YTA. Absolutely stop sending her videos of Instagram randos! The only message she is going to get from that is that you think they're better than her! Also eating less *is* the main way to lose weight, especially as you reach your 30s. Exercise can help you with health, but diet is the primary form of weight loss. All you are doing with your approach to \"helping\" is making her feel like shit. And the worse she feels emotionally, the harder it is going to be for her to make physical changes. Ask HER if, first of all, she even wants your support, and secondly, how she would like you to express that support.", "YTA.\n\n'I have told her umpteen times that eating less will not help her lose weight'\n\nThat is simply untrue. Eating less is the first step to losing weight. Given she has sore knees, back pain and neck pain I can completely understand why she's wary of adding exercise in at this point. \n\nIf you think she is neglecting her health, can you pick up some chores to free up some time for her?", "YTA for your approach. First, you\u2019re wrong and eating less is absolutely more effective at weight loss than exercising. There are people who manage to lose a ton of weight solely on eating less.  \n\nBut exercising IS important to overall health. Don\u2019t just send her videos of skinny women exercising; that\u2019s easy for those women (and their jobs). You\u2019re just making her feel inadequate. Take on some of her chores to build time for her to exercise, or find some fun and active activity that you all can do together (like hiking, or maybe dancing, if you can get a sitter). \n\nAlso, cellulite? That has nothing to do with health. Drop that from your complaints, it\u2019s shallow.", "YTA\n\nOh you\u2019re at a loss for how to help her? How about you step up as her partner and do some chores to upkeep the home you live in. Step up to do more caring for your children. Take some tasks and stress of her plate so that she\u2019s not so overwhelmed. You don\u2019t constantly send her videos of skinny women doing workouts and talking about what they eat. That\u2019s not helpful, that\u2019s demeaning.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask you to coach her 24/7. She\u2019s already working on losing the weight. She doesn\u2019t need to tell you that she\u2019s doing it all wrong all the time.", "YTA \u2014 worry about your partners health all you want. Telling her how to do it, if no one asked you too is an AH move. You want to help your partner? Removed the barriers to relaxation and peace (pretty hard with children). Reducing caloric intake is important and finding the right system is also important, but getting the body into a state where fat can be burned for fuel is paramount. When we are stressed the body stays in a prolonged sympathetic state where it\u2019s impossible to lose weight. Most parents, I find (and most Americans) live in a constant state of sympathetic activation and it takes a toll. I would also add that leaving your 20s and having children dramatically alter women\u2019s bodies and it\u2019s confusing and difficult to deal with. Give her a break FFS.", "YTA\n\nYour intentions seem genuine, however sending your wife workout videos and nagging her about what she eats does not send the message you think it does. If you want to be helpful, you should be there to support her. Maybe making healthy eating a priority for the whole family could be a start. Look up some healthy recipes, and cook. Maybe start going on walks together, find an active hobby that you both can enjoy. Make sure your wife feels loved as she is, sending her videos of skinny women working out, and eating salad probably makes her feel as though she is not good enough.", ">eating less will not help her lose weight\n\nDude, weight loss is about being at a caloric deficit. It's 90% about eating less.\n\nIs eating healthy better for your nutritionally? Yes. But people can eat 100% McDonalds or Twinkies and still lose weight if they are at a caloric deficit.\n\nYTA for giving her completely wrong information.", "YTA\n\nThe doctor has talked to her. She is aware what she weighs. It is up to her what to do about her weight (if anything) and how she approaches that. You micromanaging her eating and exercise and constantly mansplaining up pearls of wisdom in the form of IG videos is not going to help things. Btw, everyone is different. Metabolisms are different. Genetics are different. Some people eat a lot of crap and stay reasonably thin. Others strictly maintain a diet regimen and they have a hard time losing weight. My husband can eat an entire extra large pizza in one sitting. I can't eat more than a piece or two of pizza in one sitting without feeling sick. You saying, look how perfectly it's working for the babes on instagram! isn't helpful because you don't know their metabolism or genetics. \n\nWhat would probably be helpful is if you both started eating healthier as a family. Do you bring junky foods into the house for yourself? Maybe you should cut back on your own junk eating. Do you eat fast food? Eating more veggies, salads, lean meats, going on walks together as a family, etc. These are good healthy habits for all.", "Eating less is far more useful for losing weight than exercise my friend. Exercise is important for health but it is not the way to lose weight. YTA for playing expert but not for being worried about her health.", "Stop telling and trying to motivate her in the ways that you think will help.  \n\nInstead, ask her what she thinks will help.  Ask her to write out the things she thinks will help, and give her time to do this, without pressure.  Let this cover not just her health issues, but also any other issues around the house.  It's possible that there are other issues that are behind this, and that she doesn't have other outlets to handle these issues.  Solving the other problems might help solve her putting aside her health issues.  She might just be exhausted and need some breaks.", "NAH - difficult situation. Some of the posts are interpreting your description that you are more interested in her looks than her health, I cannot determine if this is the case. Unfortunately, you cannot make someone lose weight if they\u2019re not 100% on track. But what you can do is make sure you help with food prep and shopping so that everything in the house is healthy and you also promote a healthy lifestyle, that is fun and not shaming. That\u2019s about all you can do.", "YTA - Your wife by this time is clearly understands you are concerned about her health and want her to lose weight. You badgering her about what she eats and sending her videos of Instagram women is completely over the top and disrespectful. She is obviously interpreting this as criticism of her based on her reactions. Have some emotional intelligence and just stop.\n\nUnless you are a nutritionist and certified personal trainer you are not qualified to advise her.  She IS doing something about her weight. From your description it sounds like she is doing intermittent fasting, which has helped numerous people lose weight. And, yes, eating less will lead to weight loss. Your wife is working on improving herself and you need to give her space to find her way. You should be encouraging her rather than trying to micromanage what she does. \n\nThe only way anyone ever makes lasting change is if they decide to do it for THEMSELVES. You cannot \"make\" her change her lifestyle and you pushing her the way you are is damaging your relationship. Either leave your wife alone with your criticism or go to couple's therapy where you can learn to discuss things in a healthy way.", "YTA. \n\nIf it\u2019s not a goal she is actively pursuing, then do not try to force her to lose weight. Yes, you used the wording \u201cmake her change.\u201d You cannot do that.

It's not working. So stop it! \n\nThere are a lot of ways to lose weight. If it's easier for your wife to cut out a meal than to eat different foods during the ones she does have, that's actually okay! It'll still work, it's just a different method than you're used to. My nutritionist decided, after reviewing what I was eating and why, not to change anything I ate whatsoever, and instead focus on exercise, because that's where we could make most difference with least forcing me into a life that I didn't want. \n\nIf you want to help your wife, for heaven's sake stop sending her examples of women whose bodies you like better (which is the way she'll see it, no matter how much you tell her otherwise), and instead give her help and support with what she *is* trying to do. \n\nCan she exercise more instead of eating differently? Can you invite her to come do physical activities with you, for fun?

She's also showing worrying signs of what could be the beginning of disordered eating habits to deal with it by cutting meals. The last thing she needs right now is Instagram fitness bloggers. It makes her feel like you want her to be like them (as shown by her comments to you), but they are also likely to contribute more to unhealthy eating habits because those bodies probably feel very far out of reach for her right now. \n\nYour best bet is to help her find HER path forward. A therapist and a nutritionist could both be very helpful to help her work on her self-esteem issues and help her have a healthier relationship with food...if she wants that.

You also said \"I have told her umpteen times that eating less will not help her lose weight\", she heard you the first time, no need to keep repeating it as this will only cause irritation on her end. I know that if I were in her shoes I'd feel incredibly annoyed with someone that kept saying the same thing over and over and over again.\n\nYou said that she does most of the chores and cares for the children, are you aware of how much time and effort that takes? She's probably incredibly stressed with her large workload, yet alone with the added stress of you hassling her. Why don't you try to ease the burden a bit by doing some housework?

She has to want to do it for herself, and it has to be a shift that she makes IN HER HEAD.  Each person has to find what works for them in terms of motivation.  It's the same with losing weight, quitting smoking, quitting drugs, etc.  The difference with weight loss is that you can't just quit eating cold turkey.  You have to learn to control it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, about four years ago, my doctor suggested I try the free MyFitnessPal app.  He said \"you put in your height and weight and how many steps a day you want to do. It tells you how many calories per day you're allowed to reach your goal.  The phone counts your steps, and you put in whatever food you eat each day.\"  I said, \"That sounds like too much work.\"  He said, \"Just try it for a week.\"  Well, one day I thought, \"I could probably do it for a week.\"  I didn't think I'd stick with it.  But ... plug in \"Costco stuffed pepper\" or whatever, and the app already knew how many calories that had!  That was a revelation.  I also set a goal of 10,000 steps a day.  It took me about a week to work up to that many.  It wasn't that hard, actually.  I didn't do them all in one shot.  I'd take my morning break at work, go to the kitchen, make a cup of tea, then go do ten minutes' worth of laps around the big table in the conference room while the tea was steeping.  That was a thousand steps right there.  Easy.  Well, by the time that first week was up, it got to be like a game for me.  Ten thousand steps a day, and don't go over the 1,500 daily calories the app allowed me.  I ate whatever I wanted, just in smaller portions.  I also think it helped, as a little mind trick, that I was NOT focusing on weight loss - I just wanted to get those bloodwork numbers down because I was approaching pre-diabetic levels.  I thought, \"I can't control whether I get cancer or whether I have a heart attack, but I CAN control whether I get Type II diabetes.\"  So that's what I focused on.  I didn't weigh myself at all for an entire year (of course, it helped that we didn't even OWN a bathroom scale at that time) - I was weighed at that doctor visit when he suggested the app, and the next time I was weighed was a full year later at my next annual doctor visit.  I knew my clothes were getting looser (I was religious about walking every single day), but I was stunned to learn that I'd lost a whopping 85 pounds at the end of that year.  Four years down the road, I'm not walking as much, but I'm still careful to plug everything I eat into the app each day.  It keeps me honest.  (And I don't pay the monthly fee for the upgraded app, either.  I'm cheap.  Ha.)  And the weight is still gone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may or may not work for your wife.  It worked for me.  I started on a Tuesday afternoon.  There was no \"I'll start this at the beginning of next month\" or \"next week\" or whatever.  I just started in the middle of the day, in the middle of a week.  There was no reason to use an excuse to wait - I just decided one day that NOW was the moment.  But again, SHE has to be the one to decide.  Your pushing her will not get her to do it.  Not pushing her will ALSO not get her to do it.  Neither will her doctor's suggestions get her to move on this.

She may be feeling overwhelmed, out of control, or just like this is the one thing too many on top of everything she's already trying to manage.

It's not your responsibility to psychoanalyze her, but if you want to actually help (meaning if this really is about loving her and wanting her to be healthy and in your life, and not something else), find a time when she's relaxed and open. First, reassure her that you are on her side no matter what and that for you, this is NOT about her worth as a human, her worth as a person is beyond question.  Then ASK her whether she is concerned about this too, and if she is, ask her how you can help, and LISTEN to her answer, and then do that.
