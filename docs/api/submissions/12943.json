Statute of limitations for grand theft auto is 30 years in this country so there's no waiting this out.\n\nThey finally requested to talk. They tried to say that so much time had gone by that they had forgotten  about it, and how we were family and I didn't need the money so could I let this go. I wouldn't agree.

It is possible that it would affect Billy's grad school plans (if these plans are real, which I'm not sure I believe).\n\nSince then they've been bad mouthing me to that side of the family saying that I'm extorting money from them by threatening Billy's future.

OP you should just make the report because they clearly have no intentions of paying you the money. Billy has to face the consequences of his actions and you already tried to give him time to fix it/his parents fix it. 4 years and 4-5 months was more than enough time for them to come up with the money.

My hubs is a car guy, so are lots of our friends. I know exactly what you mean when you say it's literally irreplaceable. He stole a collector's item and totalled it! Call the police, get him charged!

You\u2019re not responsible for taking a huge monetary loss because their son is irresponsible.", "NTA. This is what they were hoping for - that you would forget about and that they would be off the hook. It\u2019s becoming obvious they had no intention of living up to their obligations. And the fact that they are leveraging family members to pressure you to back off is a sign that they know they don\u2019t have a legal or moral leg to stand on. \n\nThey should be the \u201cgood\u201d relatives and live up to what they agreed to those years ago.

He\u2019s damn lucky he didn\u2019t end up with a criminal charge already.", "NTA, but honestly if the rest of the family are getting on your back I'd write them all off. They are clearly old fashioned and have a boys will be boys mentality, but before you do make sure Billy knows his actions have consequences, he's a legal adult, sue him. Then his parents will either HAVE to pay you, or they'll cut Billy off. Either way it would be a lesson to not touch things that aren't yours.", "So, they want Billy to get off scot-free? No consequences? Wow. The audacity.  FILE THAT POLICE REPORT \n\nThey had no intentions of paying you back. They had four years to save and they saved nothing. \"Family is family\" is bullshit. \"Family doesn't steal from family\"", "NTA honestly what do u expect after doing that shit.
