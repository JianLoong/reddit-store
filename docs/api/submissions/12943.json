But here it was the same for my sisters friend getting caught shoplifting with a friend at the mall here. But maybe I got lucky being in California with their laws and I was only released to move with them and then banned from the state until 21yo bc of my family moving to NC as a juvenile. We never had to do a thing for mine. But my younger brother and sister had to both deal with sealing that away in NC for 1 stupid charge each. I had 5 felonies and 13 misdemeanors in Cali I was out and back in juvu weeks time.and time again, i was on my last straw before we moved or i stayed until after i turned 18. It still sealed soon as I was 18 in NC tho. Got my GED 2 weeks after turning 17 and started working with no issues bc maybe out of state records I guess didnt even show though it wasn't even sealed by then. Maybe they just didn't background check me bc I was a minor. Idk. But life has been much better since we all moved here without a new charge for me or my bro and sis and we have got used to the change of the east coast compared to the city. And all has been well since. It's literally been the best move of my life now at 33. I don't know where I'd be without that move happening.", "I would file the police report.
