So I\u2019m a student in university and I was recently put in a group project with two group mates. One of the group mates was not answering any messages and did not communicate anything. He barely even showed up for either of our two meetings and was more focused on making jokes than doing the work. On presentation day he never even showed up.\n\nI was extremely frustrated and already had a meeting with that professor scheduled for that same day. Before the meeting I got a message from the other group mate apologizing saying he must have hit stop on his alarm or something. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the AH: I was far too frustrated at this point even with this apology. I ended up telling the professor everything because I didn\u2019t want him getting any form of credit on the assignment. The professor assured me it was individual grading and he would grade appropriately. \n\nI was telling a friend about this and they said it was wrong of me to report him. They said I should have accepted his apology and moved on. The other group mate also did not seem bothered at all by what he did. I\u2019ve always been the kind of person who gets angry when group members who don\u2019t pull their weight get credit but I\u2019m also being told it\u2019s wrong of me to get his grade pushed down.

You reap what you sow. I\u2019m gonna go a bit meta with this one, and say it\u2019s fine that you told the professor. Are you kinda a tattletale? Yeaaaah. But also, you don\u2019t owe anything to that guy. At the end of the day, If you were pissed about it, and doing that is what you felt was right, and made you feel better.. that\u2019s what matters. \n\nHere\u2019s the meta part. Group project aren\u2019t group projects because the amount of work is too much for one person. The point of group projects isn\u2019t to teach you material, it\u2019s to teach you what it\u2019s like in the real world. There are going to be people like this everywhere you go. The point is to teach you how to be accountable, and hold other people accountable. Your professor knows this. He knew the real point of a group project. You said what should be said. He has all the info he needs, and he\u2019s gonna do what he\u2019s there to do. Teach. \n\nI bet he has a sit down. I bet he talks him\nThrough what he did, why he was a turd, and teach him about accountability. Better he learns it now, than later. You don\u2019t get a \u2018talking to\u2019 in the real world. Long run, this is good for both you and him", "NTA. He didn't do jackshit, why should he get rewarded for it? \"Not hitting stop on an alarm\" sounds like a bogus excuse to me. He deserves the consequences for what he did. You and your group mates did, and will get the appropriate grades for it. I hope it all goes well.", "I was the group mate not pulling their weight in a situation like this before. They reported me to the professor and it ended up negatively affecting my grade.\n\nNTA why should he benefit for your hard work but you should\u2019ve reached out to the professor earlier", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't put on the work he doesn't deserve a good grade.  It will be a painful lesson for him, but one he is better off learning in university than in the business world.", "NTA!!! And your friend should stfu. I always hated that 'don't Rock the boat' type of mentality. He didn't do the work he fails. Your colleagues don't like that? Fuck them. I don't like freeloaders.", "NTA. Your professor deciding in favor of you is enough to prove your action wasn't wrong. Also, freeloaders are always gonna be the asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Accepting apologies  isn't required if you don't feel it and his wasn't an apology", "NTA, he's not even getting specifically punished so I don't see what they're yapping about. Don't let them guilt you when you know full well they'd be doing the same in your position.", "NTA- I\u2019ve been in your position many times. It sucks but i go into every project basically prepared to do it all myself. no way i\u2019m leaving my grade in someone else\u2019s hands. If they show up and do the work well great, but i will always have a back up.\n\nand yes i will absolutely report someone for not contributing and flaking. I\u2019m not there to make friends and make other people happyZ i\u2019m there to get an education.", "NTA and like not showing up to present probably already tanked his grade", "NTA - I dropped the ball pretty bigtime on a group project back in the day and they were pissed and they reported me and I didn't really resent them for it because yeah, it's true.", "I\u2019ve had issues in other classes where the whole group was graded as though we were one person. Like I got my sections done exactly as directed but because other people messed up theirs I had points taken off. I\u2019d do whatever I can to prevent this.", "Yup. That\u2019s the concept behind group projects. It\u2019s equal responsibility being accountable for your part, and holding your team accountable for theirs. That\u2019s the lesson he\u2019s trying to teach. It\u2019s real world prep. If you think him being a shit is gonna impact you, you were absolutely right for saying something."]}
