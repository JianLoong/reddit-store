It was cold very cold (in the 60s) and my bff offered me her jacket which she told me she wanted back (we live 3 hours away from each other. \n\nHer and her bf ended up leaving earlier and my bf and I stayed an hour late. I honestly forgot I had her jacket on.\n\nShe called me the next day upset that I had her jacket and I told her I forgot, but even if I did remember I would\u2019ve figured she wanted me to have it for the night so I don\u2019t freeze. She said that no she wanted her jacket back and that I should mail it. I said \u201cokay well can you venmo me money to ship it\u201d and she said \u201cno, you\u2019re the one that took it\u201d. \n\nShe then told me she\u2019s going to be honest with me and says I\u2019m a very selfish person. She always brings up how I was stingy in middle school (which was true), but I definitely grew out of that. I told her how was I selfish when I paid for the Uber for us to the club and back to the hotel and didn\u2019t ask for any money? And for giving her tickets so her boyfriend and her can ride the Ferris wheel with us which she said she\u2019d pay me back but didn\u2019t and I never cared if she did. She then says that the fact I am \u201ccalculating\u201d everything proves even more Im a selfish person. This is frustrating bc all I was doing was defending myself.\n\nAnd when they ran out of tickets, she asked if they can just borrow mine and then she\u2019ll pay me back. She said that when my boyfriend pulled out the tickets to see if we had enough for a ride I told him \u201cno don\u2019t stress out, that\u2019s their problem to deal with not ours\u201d. I told her that was NOT true and the only time I said don\u2019t stress out was because we were running out for ourselves and I told him I\u2019ll get the next tickets. I even asked my bf and he didn\u2019t remember me ever saying that.\n\nShe says that she\u2019s making boundaries and that if I respected her boundary I should pay for the shipping of the jacket. I told her I was tight on money and I really don\u2019t understand why I need to do that and why not wait til we see each other again.\n\nShe kept calling me a selfish person so I hung up and texted her I\u2019ll mail her jacket but I needed space. She said \u201cOkay\u201d. And this morning I woke up with her sending me the address to her new place.\n\nAm I the asshole??\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention some things.\n\n\nEDIT; thank you guys for the honesty. I\u2019m still human and imperfect and learning and posting things like this and hearing perspective really helps me grow and gives me another lens to look through. I feel really bad now and I\u2019m texting her my apologizes and I will be mailing the jacket.\n\nEDIT: I sent her a message to apologize and we talked it through and it was a long history of things between us but our friendship was worth trying to improve for.

Yeah, of course you can ask for it back, but if I lend someone a jacket because they\u2019re cold, I\u2019m not going to take it back if they\u2019re still going to be out and cold barring some sort of extenuating circumstances. Which brings us back to the is keeping stuff she\u2019s borrowed and not returning it a habit from OP? I still think it sounds like it is.\n\nIf I lend someone something, the onus shouldn\u2019t be on me to have to follow up or eventually hound someone and get it back. Anyone who borrows something should make the effort to return that thing to the owner, whether or not that involves having to ship it. YMMV."]}
