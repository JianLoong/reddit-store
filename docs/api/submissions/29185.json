She said that no she wanted her jacket back and that I should mail it. I said \u201cokay well can you venmo me money to ship it\u201d and she said \u201cno, you\u2019re the one that took it\u201d. \n\nShe then told me she\u2019s going to be honest with me and says I\u2019m a very selfish person. She always brings up how I was stingy in middle school (which was true), but I definitely grew out of that. I told her how was I selfish when I paid for the Uber for us to the club and back to the hotel and didn\u2019t ask for any money? And for giving her tickets so her boyfriend and her can ride the Ferris wheel with us which she said she\u2019d pay me back but didn\u2019t and I never cared if she did. She then says that the fact I am \u201ccalculating\u201d everything proves even more Im a selfish person. This is frustrating bc all I was doing was defending myself.\n\nAnd when they ran out of tickets, she asked if they can just borrow mine and then she\u2019ll pay me back. She said that when my boyfriend pulled out the tickets to see if we had enough for a ride I told him \u201cno don\u2019t stress out, that\u2019s their problem to deal with not ours\u201d. I told her that was NOT true and the only time I said don\u2019t stress out was because we were running out for ourselves and I told him I\u2019ll get the next tickets. I even asked my bf and he didn\u2019t remember me ever saying that.\n\nShe says that she\u2019s making boundaries and that if I respected her boundary I should pay for the shipping of the jacket. I told her I was tight on money and I really don\u2019t understand why I need to do that and why not wait til we see each other again.\n\nShe kept calling me a selfish person so I hung up and texted her I\u2019ll mail her jacket but I needed space. She said \u201cOkay\u201d. And this morning I woke up with her sending me the address to her new place.\n\nAm I the asshole??\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention some things.\n\n\nEDIT; thank you guys for the honesty.

That's a bit crazy because if anything you got to use the jacket longer... \nI'm having a hard time with the fact that you're having to post and ask if you're the asshole or not here...

She's bringing up middle school, you defend yourself and she says you're keeping score.... And it sounds like you are, but she did bring it up. Plus she had to tell you she wanted her jacket back.... Why? Do you normally borrow things and not give them back? I had to scroll back to see your ages because you sounds like 14 year olds! \n\nSend her the jacket. You don't have to priority mail it overnight, but send it because you didn't give it back before she left.

If your good friends tell you about your flaws, believe them and work to improve.", "I\u2019m a little surprised by the responses here. NTA. Your friend let you borrow her jacket, and then FORGOT it with you. You didn\u2019t steal her jacket. Maybe y\u2019all can split the shipping, but for her to flip out about paying the shipping on it is crazy to me, if I leave something at a friend\u2019s house, minimum I\u2019m paying to ship it back to myself. \n\nHow often do y\u2019all see each other? If she doesn\u2019t want to pay shipping, I\u2019d just give it to her when we meet up next. \n\nAlso a boundary is not enforceable on other people lmao. Her boundary is what? That you have to ship her jacket back and pay for it or else \u2026.? That\u2019s psycho lol. A boundary is a line you draw around yourself. If other people break your boundary, you don\u2019t shove them out, you move until they\u2019re not violating your boundary anymore. \n\nExample: I have a boundary that I don\u2019t discuss politics with my dad. If he brings up politics, I change the subject. If he sticks with it, I leave the conversation completely, sometimes leaving the room, other times leaving the house/restaurant/etc wherever we are.

You're a special type of person. You're the type of person who just doesn't step on dog shit ever, at least that's what you would tell people.. lending someone an article of clothing or a jacket when it's cold outside and forgetting to collect it and or letting them continue to use it because you leave early doesn't mean that that article of clothing is not important and because the person didn't remember to get it, it doesn't make them not responsible.

The only important comment is that OP thought even if she had remembered she was wearing bff's jacket, bff would \"want her to keep wearing it because it was cold out\". BS.

I feel insane reading all these comments.", "I agree. These people do not sound like friends. It\u2019s an honest mistake to accidentally keep something like this.\n\nIf it were my jacket I accidentally left with a friend I would be perfectly fine waiting to get it back until the next time I saw them. Unless it was someone I do not expect to see again for more than 6 months.\n\nI wonder if OP has a history of \u201cborrowing\u201d things and not giving them back.

Not your responsibility so your right, but she specifically asked for the item and was told to give it back but \"forgot\" too. If your buddy asks to borrow your stuff you'll expect it back right?

Op should also have common decency & mail it back to her.", "That has nothing to do with changing how the situation should be looked at.
