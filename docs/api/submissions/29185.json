She said that no she wanted her jacket back and that I should mail it. I said \u201cokay well can you venmo me money to ship it\u201d and she said \u201cno, you\u2019re the one that took it\u201d. \n\nShe then told me she\u2019s going to be honest with me and says I\u2019m a very selfish person. She always brings up how I was stingy in middle school (which was true), but I definitely grew out of that. I told her how was I selfish when I paid for the Uber for us to the club and back to the hotel and didn\u2019t ask for any money? And for giving her tickets so her boyfriend and her can ride the Ferris wheel with us which she said she\u2019d pay me back but didn\u2019t and I never cared if she did. She then says that the fact I am \u201ccalculating\u201d everything proves even more Im a selfish person. This is frustrating bc all I was doing was defending myself.\n\nAnd when they ran out of tickets, she asked if they can just borrow mine and then she\u2019ll pay me back. She said that when my boyfriend pulled out the tickets to see if we had enough for a ride I told him \u201cno don\u2019t stress out, that\u2019s their problem to deal with not ours\u201d. I told her that was NOT true and the only time I said don\u2019t stress out was because we were running out for ourselves and I told him I\u2019ll get the next tickets. I even asked my bf and he didn\u2019t remember me ever saying that.\n\nShe says that she\u2019s making boundaries and that if I respected her boundary I should pay for the shipping of the jacket. I told her I was tight on money and I really don\u2019t understand why I need to do that and why not wait til we see each other again.\n\nShe kept calling me a selfish person so I hung up and texted her I\u2019ll mail her jacket but I needed space. She said \u201cOkay\u201d. And this morning I woke up with her sending me the address to her new place.\n\nAm I the asshole??\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention some things.\n\n\nEDIT; thank you guys for the honesty.

Get over it lol.", "*very very cold*", "I had to scrolled back up to checked on op\u2019s age!!!", "Sure. But if you forgot until you got home, what would your expection be? They return it at their expense?", "I mean you're looking at this like a lawyer would. Like if she would be legally culpable or something.\n\nThat isn't the point of this sub. It's not \"Am I Legally In the Wrong\" it's \"Am I the Asshole\" and not returning something after someone did you a favor is asshole behaviour.\n\nYou can argue all you want about whether OP *has* to or not but it's not what we're talking about. Besides have you ever been stuck in a situation like that with a whole night out in the cold without proper clothing? It ruins the night and is really uncomfortable.\n\nTheir friend did them a big favor and made the terms clear in the beginning. I feel like \"return the jacket *in a timely manner*\" is a pretty heavy implication here. Not eventually or when she feels like it. She did not so she can eat a couple bucks and send the thing to her friend. Or buy her own damn jacket which will certainly cost more. Most events like this have clothing stands.\n\nIf you were my friend and I knew you thought like this I would never lend you anything.", "No Im looking at this from how I would handle and feel about the situation. If I forgot something I lent a friend I wouldn't expect them to pay to mail it back to me I would also not think they would have the expectation I pay to mail them something.\n\nThat's great because if you were my friend I wouldn't ask you to borrow anything if your this nit picky about it being returned the instant I am no longer using it. But I guess that's why I have the friends I do because we're all more relaxed on it and no one would expect the other to mail the item back immediately. If they did said item in the very near future they would ask for it back before they left.", "Are you really under the impression that if you handed your friend a piece of clothing and *didn't* explicitly say you wanted it back, that they would just keep it?\n\n\nYou need better friends."]}
