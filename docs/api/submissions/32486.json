She deserved to hear something like that. She's been persistently pushy, but to use the occasion push her agenda is in especially bad taste. You're entitled to mourn in your own way, without interference.", " I lost my sister very suddenly in our early 20s and I had someone trying this on me when I returned to work.

By your own admission, no one in your family is a religious zealot, so I am not going to presume that your grandmother is being predatory. If you and her have had a good relationship until now, her intentions might be out of genuinely wanting to help you heal. Your brother's untimely passing has devastated your family, she felt that pain too and her faith has helped her. She sees you hurting and wants to help in her way. It's misguided, absolutely and she should have stopped when you told her to. I would suggest talking to her and tell her that last sentance in your post. You were at the end of your rope and she was in the line of fire. Especially if this is a relationship you want to heal.", "I am as anti-religious as they come, the sooner we leave it behind the better off we will all be. But what you said was like smacking her in the head with a ball bat. So slight YTA you should apologize for what you said and how you said it. You appreciate what she was trying to do for you but you need to grieve in your own way.", "Over the years, God has killed enough babies that I doubt whether He deserves to be worshiped.\n\nThat being said, you found a hurtful way to say \"no, thank you\" to a woman whose only concern was to help you.\n\nSmall YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or limiting contact with your family. It sounds like they refuse to respect your decision not to be religious and are of the missionary mind set that everyone is needing to be reached. \n\nThey won\u2019t stop or see reason in that.

That hurt won't ever really go away. I would aplogize to her, not for what you said, those are your honest feelings, but apologize for hurting her feelings as I am sure that wasn't your intention. A good, honest conversation will help a lot."]}
