She deserved to hear something like that. She's been persistently pushy, but to use the occasion push her agenda is in especially bad taste. You're entitled to mourn in your own way, without interference.", " I lost my sister very suddenly in our early 20s and I had someone trying this on me when I returned to work.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss and absolutely NTA,she should be ashamed of herself.", "I'm going to go against the grain slightly and say NAH. By your own admission, no one in your family is a religious zealot, so I am not going to presume that your grandmother is being predatory. If you and her have had a good relationship until now, her intentions might be out of genuinely wanting to help you heal. Your brother's untimely passing has devastated your family, she felt that pain too and her faith has helped her. She sees you hurting and wants to help in her way. It's misguided, absolutely and she should have stopped when you told her to. I would suggest talking to her and tell her that last sentance in your post. You were at the end of your rope and she was in the line of fire. Especially if this is a relationship you want to heal.", "I am as anti-religious as they come, the sooner we leave it behind the better off we will all be. But what you said was like smacking her in the head with a ball bat. So slight YTA you should apologize for what you said and how you said it. You appreciate what she was trying to do for you but you need to grieve in your own way.", "Over the years, God has killed enough babies that I doubt whether He deserves to be worshiped.\n\nThat being said, you found a hurtful way to say \"no, thank you\" to a woman whose only concern was to help you.\n\nSmall YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or limiting contact with your family. It sounds like they refuse to respect your decision not to be religious and are of the missionary mind set that everyone is needing to be reached. \n\nThey won\u2019t stop or see reason in that. It sounds like you need time and more importantly space to process some things. And it may help to limit contact for a bit if you can to allow that.", "catch them while they\u2019re hurting and vulnerable. nta.", "We do have a very good relationship otherwise. I was her first grandchild; and when my brother and I were kids we went and visited her every summer.   \n\n\nThe house I live in is one she bought for my dad so that he would always have a place to live, and though he hasn't moved in there yet both he and my grandma offered me to move in because I was about to be homeless. I've been there for almost 2 years now.   \n\n\nMy mom would have more than happily taken me into her home if she had space, but sadly she just couldn't accommodate me, all my things, my 2 cats, and 2 dogs which she still feels bad about.", "That\u2019s the conversion way! Then you get the tithes! Then you get the private planes!", "Wow. It honestly sounds like you have a good family. And I am truly sorry for the loss of your brother. That hurt won't ever really go away. I would aplogize to her, not for what you said, those are your honest feelings, but apologize for hurting her feelings as I am sure that wasn't your intention. A good, honest conversation will help a lot.", "NAH. I do believe she means well, but she's still wrong. She's wrong, she's just not an asshole. \n\nMaybe you could send her a nice card with a note that says you're sorry you two had an unpleasant exchange. Tell her you know she loves you and she meant well, but please not to bring it up again, as you are firm in your convictions and such talk will just drive a wedge between you two - and that's not what you need right now. Then tell her you love her.", "I'm very sorry for the loss of your brother.\n\nSo the thing about the deeply devout is that to them, a belief in a benevolent higher power really *is* comforting. \n\nSome people desperately need to believe that the universe is not an incomprehensibly complex place and our lives are shaped by randomness that's completely out of our control. They need to believe that they're living in a universe where nothing is random and everything will turn out okay eventually. The idea that there is a loving God who sweeps in like some ineffable grief counselor is what they cleave to -- because to them, the alternate is too horrifying to contemplate.\n\nYour grandmother sees that you're in pain. She loves you, and she's trying to help. Unfortunately, the tools at her disposal -- which work for her -- do not work for you.\n\nYou're choosing to perceive her words as opportunism for recruitment, and that she is being deliberately disrespectful. It might be worth asking whether your grandmother has a history of malicious behavior which would support you thinking the worst of her -- or whether she just happened to reach out with her own (inadequate) tools when you were feeling particularly raw. \n\nOne hopes this is **NAH**, just two grieving people.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My grandma hasn't said anything on the topic since,\" ... GOOD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"but I've had a few people tell me that my comment really hurt her.\" .. SHE hurt you with HER comment.", "NTA.  You are honest.  If your grandmother really believe in Jesus Christ, she should find comfort and healing in the fact she will reunite with your brother in heaven.  \n\nRegarding you hurting her feeling, she has this all mighty God to pray to and heal her wounds.  She then would keep praying for your and the rest of the family's salvation.\n\nIf she is a true believer, she would have forgiven you as she has been forgiven by Jesus Christ.", "NAH but your grandma overstepped. Sounds like she really, really thought she was helping and was oblivious that she was having the opposite effect. \n\nYou probably did hurt her feelings but she wasn't otherwise stopping so this sounds like one of those \"doesn't feel great but what was I supposed to do\" situations. If she tries again you can say, \"We've already discussed this and I don't want to go over it again, please stop.\"\n\nIf she keeps away from the subject, you can be extra nice to her to show you appreciate it.", "NTA she pushed and everyone has a point where they can't be polite anymore.", "Grandma was being a vulture for Jesus so OP made it clear where she was coming from. She's very much justified.", "I went absolutely nuclear my first Xmas after my mum died, so religious minimising of humanity really gets to me. \n\nI lost my mum and my dad and aunt lost their mum (obviously my grandma) the same year. My dad was moaning so much that my aunt seemed sad that Xmas 5 and 6 months after our losses and we should be grateful for what god had left us with. Why can't we just enjoy Xmas and be like it always was. \n\nDidn't want to go anywhere for Xmas without my mum but toughed it out. As soon as my aunts emotions that I was also experiencing were minimised, I didn't know I was capable of saying such horrible and targeted things to someone. Having your grief invalidated and your loved ones grief invalidated fucks you up. \n\nMost times you deal with cultists and let them think what makes them comfy. When you get invalidated for being human and feeling how you feel instead of being glad your loved ones are dead as its what some deity wanted? It just makes people a little aggy now and then.", "I agree with you Shark, came to say something similar. Everyone processes grief differently. I have family members who have a (what I consider) healthy relationship with faith and religion. They are good and congruent people (they walk their talk). OP's grandma sounds like a good person (from the context above). I think her way of processing grief has truly been through faith in a higher power, and attributing \" hidden reason\" for this immense tragedy/pain. She was trying to help OP with hers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure, people shouldn't insist when other's aren't connecting with their advice (even if they're convinced about it). But it sounds like it came from a place of love, not predatory behavior. I'm sorry for your loss OP, it's an unimaginable pain and hole that never goes away. You should be able to choose what works for you to help you carry it. She should respect that. You should still not let this damage your relationship in the long term. Talk to her."]}
