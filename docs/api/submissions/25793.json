My mom hasn't talked to her parents in about 10 years. It's a complicated mess but they are a bunch of toxic assholes who sided with a criminal and someone they never should have over innocent people. My mom was disgusted and stepped away from them. So she has no extended family.\n\nMy mom used to be married to my dad. He died 4 years ago but they were divorced for a little over a year at the time of his death. My dad became hooked on drugs after he was a witness to something extremely traumatic and he was destroying his life before he died. It destroyed my parents marriage and it hurt my mom a lot, especially after the drama with her family. I (17m) always loved my dad even when he was sick, and I do believe his addiction was a sickness, but I understand why it was so hard for my mom on top of her own family stuff. It was also hard for my dad's family. My grandma and my aunts and uncle. My grandpa died when dad and his siblings were young and my grandma also lost two babies. So she was through a lot as well.\n\nMy mom and grandma got along fine but I never would have called them close and after the divorce they didn't really keep in touch much. But since my mom got pregnant her and Chris have been so weird about my grandma. It started over my baby blanket. My grandma made my baby blanket and she has it again now because I asked her to save it for me. Dad had just died at the time and mom and I were moving a lot and I was worried something would happen to it. Mom knew where it went. So when she learned she was having another baby she asked grandma to have it for her new baby. My grandma said it would be up to me and I said no.\n\nSo Chris told her she should make the baby a blanket since she'll have a new grandchild. I was just as caught off guard as my grandma was. She told him the baby was not her grandchild and why would he think they are. He said since baby will be my sibling it would only be kind to accept their child as a grandchild. My mom said grandma knows she has no family and given what my dad aka grandma's son put her through, she should consider doing the kindest thing possible and accept them as family and welcome a new grandchild who will be related through me if nothing else. Grandma said that it wasn't fair to put dad's trauma onto her. That he went through something none of us would understand. She also said she has no obligation to the baby and that I'm almost out of mom's house and she doesn't need to be around the baby at all once I'm gone.\n\nMy mom and Chris have repeatedly tried to change her mind. So one day I told them they were being so weird with grandma and the baby. I told them grandma has nothing to do with this and it sucks that the baby won't have grandparents (Chris' parents are dead) but it doesn't mean my grandma owes anything. My mom said grandma could do something loving and generous and I should be encouraging grandma and not calling Chris and her weird.

Nta", "NTA move in with the grandma. \n\nYour mom and Chris sound terribly entiteld", "I agree with you. It is crappy of them. Especially when mom knows how much grandma has already lost. She also knows it's not grandma's fault that dad ended up sick.", "This is exactly what I came here to say. Glad that you've got your grandma's back, OP!", "I would leave out kind of and put in very.", "NTA, but the weirder part for me is that they seem to know she isn't, but hope she'll be \"generous\". What the ??", "It says in the post, 17m", "NTA\n\n Wtf is wrong with people expecting their ex's family to give a shit about their new kids?? In what universe is your grandma responsible for her son's ex wife's new kid??", "You are a very young and very mature man. I admire that you understand that your dad was sick and I thank you for that. My family history is full of addicts and alcoholics. Not one of them chose that disease. It might be presumptuous of me to say this, but I am old enough to be your dad, I think he\u2019d be very proud of you.", "NTA - If your grandma is a seamstress (or knitter-or crocheter) who originally made the blanket for you maybe ask her to teach you the craft and you could make the new baby a blanket. I\u2019ve been sewing for years and making baby quilts is a lot of fun. There are lots of creative patterns out there. Don\u2019t know how geographically close you are to your grandma, but it might be fun activity to do together and you could learn a new skill.", "Some people can absolutely step in and be family with no blood ties. Some cannot. \n\nNo one can change their minds about it though. You should stay out of their disagreement though, as it has nothing to do with you TBH.\n\nYour Mom can knit or crochet a baby blanket if the idea is so special to her. You could as well - in many cultures knitting is unisex or a masculine task as men have need of winter sweaters more than women (Mom's family was from Sweden and all the men knew how to knit).", "NTA. Your mom and Chris are manipulative af. There's no reason for your grandma to take on their kid as a grandchild", "NTA\n\nNone of them are related to your grandma.\n\nIt's pretty weird insisting that baby will be your grandmother's grandchild, JUST because your mom and Chris have decided that it's good for the baby..", "That or free child care", "Gifts, inheritance, babysitting\u2026", "Or go to goodwill and get a used blanket for $10 or less. But I would guess that they don\u2019t want to spend the money or time but they\u2019re too good for something used. The choosing beggars sort.", "Please let your grandma know she can block your mom and her husband.  I\u2019m so sorry your mom is behaving this way.  You are NTA and I hope everything settles down.", "NTA I smell money. I'm guessing Grandma has assets that mom and me guy want.\n\nI'm so sorry about your dad, and your situation.\nI wish you happiness, and luck.  Take care.", "NTA, your mom has some audacity demanding this after she abandoned your dad when he really needed her", "It would be nice if grandma saw it their way but she doesn\u2019t! They aren\u2019t taking no for an answer which turns this ugly.  Do they really believe they can override your grandmother\u2019s feelings or yours to force this?", "NTA and before any blocking happens, do you have stuff from your childhood that is yours or grandma's, that you don't want to lose other than the baby blanket? I'm not advocating to basically steal anything that isn't rightfully yours from your mom, mind you, but if there are some things like that, make sure they're in a safe place and then have a talk with your mom about her behaviour and said thing(s). Also let grandma know that you may need some time.", "So how much money does grandma have? Cuz that would explain the weirdness.", "NTA.\n\nFor the life of me, I do not understand the great leaps in logic these non relatives use to justify harassing ex in-laws to accept and treat the children from new relationships like family. OP says that while they kept a decent relationship, his mom and grandmother weren't close. So, all of a sudden Mom and her new-totally unrelated partner want this outside person to treat their kid like her grandchild? This is too weird.\n\nIf OP's dad had lived and he started a new family with someone else, would Mom and Chris have treated OP's half sibling from dad as a bonus child? Something tells me, no, they wouldn't have.\n\nOP, ignore the noise from Mom and Chris. It makes absolutely no sense.", "You're NTA. Why don't you make a blanket for the new baby? That might soothe everybody's feelings.", "I think they want a free babysitter."]}
