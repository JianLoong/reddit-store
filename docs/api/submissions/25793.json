My mom hasn't talked to her parents in about 10 years. It's a complicated mess but they are a bunch of toxic assholes who sided with a criminal and someone they never should have over innocent people. My mom was disgusted and stepped away from them. So she has no extended family.\n\nMy mom used to be married to my dad. He died 4 years ago but they were divorced for a little over a year at the time of his death. My dad became hooked on drugs after he was a witness to something extremely traumatic and he was destroying his life before he died. It destroyed my parents marriage and it hurt my mom a lot, especially after the drama with her family. I (17m) always loved my dad even when he was sick, and I do believe his addiction was a sickness, but I understand why it was so hard for my mom on top of her own family stuff. It was also hard for my dad's family. My grandma and my aunts and uncle. My grandpa died when dad and his siblings were young and my grandma also lost two babies. So she was through a lot as well.\n\nMy mom and grandma got along fine but I never would have called them close and after the divorce they didn't really keep in touch much. But since my mom got pregnant her and Chris have been so weird about my grandma. It started over my baby blanket. My grandma made my baby blanket and she has it again now because I asked her to save it for me. Dad had just died at the time and mom and I were moving a lot and I was worried something would happen to it. Mom knew where it went. So when she learned she was having another baby she asked grandma to have it for her new baby. My grandma said it would be up to me and I said no.\n\nSo Chris told her she should make the baby a blanket since she'll have a new grandchild. I was just as caught off guard as my grandma was. She told him the baby was not her grandchild and why would he think they are. He said since baby will be my sibling it would only be kind to accept their child as a grandchild. My mom said grandma knows she has no family and given what my dad aka grandma's son put her through, she should consider doing the kindest thing possible and accept them as family and welcome a new grandchild who will be related through me if nothing else. Grandma said that it wasn't fair to put dad's trauma onto her. That he went through something none of us would understand. She also said she has no obligation to the baby and that I'm almost out of mom's house and she doesn't need to be around the baby at all once I'm gone.\n\nMy mom and Chris have repeatedly tried to change her mind. So one day I told them they were being so weird with grandma and the baby. I told them grandma has nothing to do with this and it sucks that the baby won't have grandparents (Chris' parents are dead) but it doesn't mean my grandma owes anything. My mom said grandma could do something loving and generous and I should be encouraging grandma and not calling Chris and her weird.
