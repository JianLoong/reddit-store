I was patient with her at first but then it turns out she had no intention of leaving my house at all, she wanted to stay rent free at my house for at least 2 months because her bf asked her for a long break.\n\n\nI tried to be patient with her but after 2 weeks i lost my temper and kicked her out.\nShe went back to her bf's house who was unhappy with her coming back so soon.

This was all the natural consequence of the way she has chosen to live her life. You owe her nothing. If she was a either good friend or a responsible person,, she would have options.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't wreck her life. She did.", "NTA. None of this is your fault.\n\nShe did all this to herself, you're just the nearest convenient person for her to blame.", "NTA\n\nShe created her own problems.\n\n*None* of it is your fault. You were beyond generous to put up with her for 2 weeks.", "NTA. Your aunt has made a lot of bad choices and she doesn\u2019t seem to be learning from any of them. You have to know that once she sets up shop in your house, her lifestyle isn\u2019t going to ever offer her a chance to move out on her own. If you didn\u2019t kick her out, she would have died in your house. She now needs to unfortunately learn the hard way how to survive.", "NTA in any way. She\u2019s the asshole for overstepping as a guest and deceiving you about the timeline. It\u2019s not hard to be respectful but She chose to be a troublesome guest. \n\nYou\u2019re not responsible for her life. She made life choices and now has to live with those choices. She\u2019s looking for someone to blame so she doesn\u2019t have to face facts. She sounds toxic!", "NTA This is not your fault at all. You didn't cause the fight between them in the first place. She said a few days but had no intention of leaving after a few days. He was always going to break up with her, but her return just accelerated the timeline. None of this was your fault. She just can't accept responsibility that her actions have consequences.", "NTA. She is facing the consequences of her own actions.  You cannot let people come in your home and take over like it's theirs.  Especially when they don't have to pay rent.  If she isn't working and has no savings how is that in ANY way YOUR issue?  Evidently she feels like she can just coast through life without putting in a lot of effort.  At 43, she should have figured out by now that she can't just assume people will ALWAYS take care of her.  She is in this situation because she FAILED at being a responsible adult.  Responsible adults work for a living so they can pay rent, eat, buy clothing, etc.  Even homemakers/ stay-at-home-parents WORK by taking care of the home and the children.  You are not obligated to give someone help if they have no interest in getting their life together if they are in a bad situation.  She needs to find a job and start supporting herself, something she SHOULD have done a LONG time ago.  Carry on and don't give her another thought, she behaves horribly;  the rest of your family won't put up with her behavior, there is no reason you should either.", "NTA.\n\nYou're just one more victim in a long line, no doubt. She's the very definition of a toxic person. All of her problems were caused by her, but she blames anyone (and everyone) else. \n\nBe glad you got her out of your house, now get her out of your life.", "NTA. This is not your problem, she is a grown woman who can take care of herself. Honestly i see so many AITA on here that's like \"my great grandfather owes a blood debt to a long dead egyptian King, because he pissed on his sarcophagus way before i was ever born, AITA for not sacrificing my children for the blood debt so my great grandfather isnt cursed for eternity?\" Maybe my example is a little wacky but that's how ridiculous these feel to me. Ridiculous in a \"its upsetting to me that people are made to feel THIS responsible for someone elses terrible decisions and get guilt trippped\" kind of way. Nobody should feel guilt tripped like this, it's shitty ya know?", "NTA. All of this is her responsibility. You were good enough to try to help her but she couldn't even behave herself. Hasn't she worked out yet why people aren't queuing up to take her in?", "NTA. The only person responsible for her life is her. She\u2019ll have to get a job won\u2019t she and stop being a drain on other people!", "NTA. She brought that on herself. She could have gone to a hotel after you kicked her. She chosed to go back to her bf. And to be honest, he might would hae dumped her even if she had given him time. She just wants to be angry at someone else and blame you, so she doesn't have to realize that it is her own fault", "People spend a lifetime building their own bed, then decide they don't like it when they try to lie down in it. *Then* they try to blame someone else for all the pain. Your aunt is reaping what she sowed, none of this is your doing.\n\nNTA. She's done all this to herself.", "NTA. She's blaming you for the results of her own bad behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe deliberately misled you, asking for days when she wanted months.\n\nOn the other hand, you offered days, and allowed weeks. That was extremely generous.\n\nAnd if her BF kicked her to the curb because their \"break\" wasn't long enough, then their relationship was already over.", "NTA\n\nIf your aunt being around her partner caused him to dump her, there\u2019s definitely issues in that relationship that no one could heal lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You did the right thing getting her out of your life, everything past that is her own fault.", "NTA. What everyone else is saying, her fault", "NTA She is just lashing out as she usually does at the nearest convenient person. Their break up has nothing to do with you, she is probably just trying to make you feel guilty enough to take her back. Do not do that. If you hadn't of taken her in, she would still be blaming you. You were in a no win situation. Next time do not be persuaded to act against your better judgement.", "NTA.  There is no reason she could not have gone straight to a hotel the first time.  She suckered you.  Block her.  She has created her own issues.  She needs to go get a job and quit sponging off people or, if she is going to sponge, she needs to suck up to them for exactly this reason.  Not your monkeys, not your circus, not your problem.", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason no one else would help her. You gave her a chance and she blew it. Block her and move on.", "NTA", "Nta. Not your circus, not your monkeys", "NTA. If you let her move back in or if you hadn't kicked her out in the first place, she would have ended up staying a lot longer than two months.", "NTA \n\nI had to check her age again. She's almost double your age.\n\nYou already know that she broke up with her bf because she treated him the same way she treated you. Their break up has nothing to do with you. \n\nYou are under no obligation to help such an entitled person.\n\nShe is perfectly capable of finding a job.", "NTA.  Nope-nope-nope, this is ALL on her, every bit of it.  You tried to be nice, tried to help her and she took advantage and abused your kindness.  When you kicked her out she didn\u2019t have to go back to her BF\u2019s, but she did.  And seriously - he asked her to leave on a \u201cbreak\u201d - he was going to break up with her anyway, it just happened a little faster.  That she has no income or savings in case of emergency is also entirely on her.  No, OP, you aren\u2019t TA here, your aunt is reaping the consequences of her own behavior.", "Wow! She definitely brings the drama to any situation. NTA and time to block her or at least put her on mute for a few months.", "She\u2019s trying to guilt you into letting her move back in.
