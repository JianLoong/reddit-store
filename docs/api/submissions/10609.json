It's selfish.  Don't talk to him. He's the freaking adult.  No. I'd die on that hill.edit NTA and I'm 45.", "NTA", "ESH, anyone giving the silent treatment to others that doesn\u2019t have a single digit age is an asshole. Also, cool it with the gym vs BJJ. I\u2019ve been doing BJJ off and on for about 7 years and people will call it the gym, MMA, karate, judo and anything else that comes to mind when they forgot the name it\u2019s really not that big of a deal.\n\nAs a side note my coworker called it strangling your friends in pajamas which is my personal favorite.", "I'm going to say NTA, but this is more because of your age than anything else. \n\nYour family sounds petty as all get out and it's honestly really sad to see. The smartest person in the village is always more concerned about being smart than the dumbest is about being dumb. You know that your family's pretension is ridiculous, but by insisting on correcting the old man you're starting to act a lot like him. I agree, it's frustrating to hear someone get it wrong, especially deliberately. But for your own future happiness and relationships (outside your family because their attitudes aren't going to change) I'd think about trying to work on figuring out the things that matter to you. At the end of the day, the people close to you know that you take jiu-jitsu lessons. The people who hear you're at the gym from your grandfather probably don't matter in your life.", "NTA\nYou didn't nothing wrong and he's deciding to be silent towards you. He can stop whenever he wants.\nYour grandmother wants you to apologise? For what? Offering to pay him back for money he spent on you?", "I\u2019m on the fence about the 15 year old OP (since you know, they are a minor still), but I can honestly say this family sounds *exhausting* regardless.", "Going to the gym and participating in a cultural martial art are 2 different things. So, no, it's not pretentious and is disrespectful on many levels.", "My sister once gave me the silent treatment for over a year for using 6 disposable forks from her package of 50 (I didn't know the package was hers). Some families are just Like This. As someone who grew up in this dynamic, part of you is so angry with their abuse that you pick more fights intentionally. You know they're going to ice you out over something dumb eventually, so it might as well be on this hill as any other just to get it over with.", "NTA - you're acting your age. You're 15 for goodness sake! You do need to mature, but that comes with time and experience. \n\nYour Grandpa, however, should know FAR better. For someone who tells you off for being prideful, he's being very prideful. He's being TA in this situation.", "So\u2026 what *is your reaction to his silent treatment? To not apologise? \n\nNTA. You asked your grandpa to call your classes by their name. He refused and went off. \n\nIf you want to stir the pot, slip the 40$ under his door. Otherwise, live your life and ignore the baby.", "NTA or soft Y T A, this is a petty as hell argument and i can see why you'd want to specify its name given the nature of the workout. Youre a kid but it doesnt seem like youre being disrespectful about it. Your grandpa shouldn't be stooping to a kid's level of arguments. \n\nAlso silent treatments are in the top 3 most immature and childish responses to a disagreement imo, and are definitely not a sign of high intelligence. The most intelligent people Ive ever met have always been open to discussion and debates without taking it personally.", "Going to go against the grain and say NTA (for this specific situation because this family dynamic is overall weird asf). \n\nIf my anyone turned to me and said \u201cwant to go to the gym?\u201d and when we got there it\u2019s a Jiu Jitsu class? I\u2019d be pissed because they\u2019re NOT the same. So I don\u2019t see a problem for wanting accuracy here. \n\nIf it was a different scenario, a \u201cless pretentious\u201d one as others have commented, I think more people would say NTA. Example: a young artist who loved painting and their grandparent kept saying they loved drawing, it\u2019s simply not correct?\n\nEdit: I have yet to understand how \u201cintelligence\u201d plays any factor in this silent treatment", "Esh Who cares if he\u2019s calling it going to the gym let the old Man be And he sucks for using the silent treatment as a punishment. I think it\u2019s stupid to pick this hill to die on in my opinion both of you need to get over yourselves.", "Do you read it as E-S-H? Or eeeesh? It seems like a fitting intonation.", "ESH everybody sucks here.", "Wow, that stung."]}
