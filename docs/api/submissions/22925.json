You do not owe them anything. This includes your brother, for he is not content with what little you gave to spare, he is greedy, and will just keep taking.\n\nDo whatever it takes to start saving money, so that you are covered for emergencies; do not tell your family about your savings. Start looking for better paying jobs. Find a way to take care of yourself.  If that includes cutting off your family, for your own financial wellbeing, then so be it.
