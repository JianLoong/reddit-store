{"id": 22677, "submission_id": "1546wsd", "title": "AITA for taking my engagement ring to get assessed professionally?", "selftext": "My bf(33M) and I(29F) have been together for 3 years. He is a very frugal person which was fine initially but now is just killing our relationship. Im quite frugal myself, I own my own apartment, my car is a Honda Fit was paid for in cash. I have no debt and I have over $240000 in retirement, assets and savings.\n\nBut he takes it to another level. If we eat out  every meal must be split between us according to who ate what and he will correct the waitress until I decide to pay more so the waitress doesn\u2019t suffer having to redo the bill. He paid for the first few dates but then never ever took me out again not even on my birthday. Never any presents other than a card and maybe a slice of cake. I bought him a nice watch for his birthday but then never got him anything at all because I was really disappointed by his gift to me. He is not poor he makes ~$70k a year in a MCOL area. He owns 3 pairs of shoes a sandal, sneaker and winter boot and nothing else even though it rains enough rain boots are necessary. It use to be very nice he was non capitalistic but now it\u2019s just annoying. When we went to vacation(after some begging on my part because he doesn\u2019t want to pay for any travel) we had to leave at 3:00 am and have a 5 hour layover because the direct flight that lets us get a decent nights rest is $200 more. Maybe it\u2019s a difference of opinion but to me being dog tired and sitting in the airport for 5 hours isn\u2019t worth the $200 saved and he refused to pay it and it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to travel separately so I doubt with it. Everything is about saving money and he refuses to go skiing or to escape rooms with me because it costs money.\n\nAnyway he got me the engagement ring and I said yes. Initially I did have reservations because of what I mentioned above but put that out of my head. He didn\u2019t give me anything associated with the ring and when a friend saw it he swore up and down it wasn\u2019t a diamond. I also am very dubious my bf would ever pay for a diamond. So I went to a jeweller got it assessed. Turns out to be a white sapphire. They told me the ring should be worth $500-800. Which is not a problem on its own but the fact he wouldn\u2019t even spend much money on an engagement ring just makes me question how I\u2019m expected to live with him in the future. He rent but lives in a terrible place to save money, will I be expected to live like that? \n\nI brought it up with him later and he got furious and accused me of being a golddigger for checking the ring. I kept telling him it\u2019s just one of the many problems I have tried to talk about with him regarding  his spending and he just accused me of trying to cover up that I wanted an expensive ring. I\u2019m being made to feel like a villain for not being happy about the ring and how much I\u2019m expected to sacrifice because of his frugality.

For many women it\u2019s the nicest piece of jewelry they own, or even the only really nice piece they own. Some women want to pass it down as a family heirloom or even reuse it as an engagement ring for one of their children.

This is not to say anyone has to buy a ring outside of their means or go into debt about it, but if last year you blew $1500 on that graphics card or saved up $3000 for your vacation with friends, or picked up a $1200 flatscreen, why is this ring that\u2019s meant to last multiple lifetimes worth less than those things?\n\nTo OP, for all the reasons I just listed, you are perfectly within reason to demand a nice, lasting, ring, with a price tag appropriate for such a piece.

I kinda see why he reacted the way he did given his level of frugality\u2026he did go overboard, but was that truly unexpected?  But I read this and think, for you, the ring pretty much symbolizes everything problematic with this relationship.  You seem fundamentally incompatible. You probably need to take a good, hard look at the last three years and ask yourself if this is how you want to spend the next 50 years.  He is not likely to modify his frugality at this point in his life.\n\nWe all like to think that love is enough to make a good marriage.  It\u2019s not.  It provides the foundation for finding a way to mesh our lives, our individuality, all the things that make us singular and unique into a unit.  When something as fundamental as finances can\u2019t be aligned through compromise and whatnot, fights are going to happen.

You definitely didn't need to do this, although I would suggest rethinking if you should get married to him. Perhaps you shouldn't have said yes if you're this financially incompatible, an issue that is one of the top reasons in divorce statistics.\n\nHonestly the whole \"spend as much as you can\" on a ring or wedding has never made sense to me when there are way more important things, like a healthy relationship and marriage. My ring and wedding were extremely affordable, which I requested because I wanted to save for a house instead.

He paid for the first few dates but then never ever took me out again not even on my birthday. Never any presents other than a card and maybe a slice of cake. I bought him a nice watch for his birthday but then never got him anything at all because I was really disappointed by his gift to me. He is not poor he makes ~$70k a year in a MCOL area. He owns 3 pairs of shoes, sandals, sneakers and winter boots and nothing else. It use to be very nice he was no non capitalistic but now it\u2019s just annoying. When we went to vacation we had to leave at 3:00 am and have a 5 hour layover because the direct flight that lets us get a decent nights rest is $200 more. Maybe it\u2019s a difference of opinion but being dog tired and sitting in the airport is worth the $200 and he refused to pay it and it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to travel separately so I doubt with it. Everything is about saving money and he refuses to go skiing or to escape rooms with me because it costs money.\n\nAnyway he got me the engagement ring and I said yes. Initially I did have reservations because of what I mentioned above but put that out of my head. He didn\u2019t give me anything associated with the ring and when a friend saw it he swore up and down it wasn\u2019t a diamond. I also am very dubious my bf would ever pay for a diamond. So I went to a jeweller got it assessed. Turns out to be a white sapphire. Which is not a problem on its own but the fact he wouldn\u2019t even spend much money on an engagement ring just makes me question how I\u2019m expected to live with him in the future. He rent but lives in a terrible place to save money, will I be expected to live like that? \n\nI brought it up with him later and he got furious and accused me of being a golddigger for checking the ring. I kept telling him it\u2019s just one of the many problems with his I will mess to spend any money and he just accused me of trying to cover up that I wanted an expensive ring. I\u2019m being made to feel like a villain for not being happy about the ring and how much I\u2019m expected to sacrifice because of his frugality.

That does not bode well for the foundation of a marriage.  OP sounds like she's financially stable, and could probably buy a nice ring herself if it meant that much to her, but the fact that he seemed to know she would appreciate a diamond and tried to dupe her instead of discussing it?

We once saw him scream like a banshee because some Oreos had gone stale and he hates wasting food. Told my aunt to use them to bake something or he\u2019d make her eat them. Made the kids buy all clothes 3 sizes too big so they\u2019d grow into them. Was seriously rich AF and they looked like ragamuffins. Holes in their shoes. His fancy job paid for kids to go to private schools so he pocketed the money and sent them to public school. When she finally left him and left everything behind everyone was thrilled. He was thrilled she didn\u2019t come after him for child support and never talked to his kids again. TO SAVE MONEY. He is loaded.", "But by then they are married and divoris so expensive!\n\nModern problems require modern solutions.", "Diamonds are terrible investments.", "not so much.  diamonds aren\u2019t that rare, the market is artificially inflated, and like a new car the perceived \u201cvalue\u201d immediately decreases by *a lot* after purchase for retail jewelry of any kind.  only the highest quality pieces retain value, and it\u2019s best to buy vintage items if that\u2019s what matters to you.  retail markup is insane for everything, especially jewelry.", "Tell me you understand nothing about diamonds without telling me you understand nothing about diamonds.", "\u201cdoes not baby it\u201d is extremely subjective based on your lifestyle.  I\u2019m really glad it worked well for her!  but emerald can definitely be damaged over time depending on what it\u2019s exposed to, and many people intend pieces like this to be heirloom items that can be passed down for generations.", "Wedding dress?  You only wear it once!  Can\u2019t you rent one?", "Got a nickel that he would have to eat first, then \"his\" children and IF there is anything left OP can have it.", "Diamonds have been popular as engagement rings since the mid 1900s when Debeers started pushing them. Less than 100 years,", "I agree. I\u2019m on team moissanite or lab diamond. Both great conflict free, more sustainable choices.", "I appreciate that and I think it\u2019s fine as long as she\u2019s fine with it and they both agree. Which is not the case here.", "Ok troll", "\u201cTolerated\u2026 going 50/50 on dates\u201d\n\nYup. That doesn\u2019t sound like good digging at all.\n\nI will say In my family we don\u2019t pay attention to birthdays either, though if partner said they did consider it important it would be important to me. That is something I\u2019d agree with you that you have brought up.", "Sorry I don't speak propaganda", "This didn\u2019t come up for us until we bought our first home. It wasn\u2019t when we got engaged or married it was several years later when we were buying homeowners insurance. We opted not to because my ring isn\u2019t that expensive and we didn\u2019t care but it was talked about during the buying process.", "She\u2019s upset because he pretended it was a diamond as well. I think if he wasn\u2019t so cheap otherwise she probably wouldn\u2019t have even cared.", "True. You shouldn\u2019t lie about it either way, but he could have gotten off so easily if he\u2019d gotten her a moissanite and told her about why they\u2019re awesome. So he\u2019s cheap, and he\u2019s too lazy to do stone research.\n\nFor a birthday gift I asked for a canary moissanite ring. It\u2019s gorgeous, and I love it. Moissanite wasn\u2019t a thing when my husband proposed, but if it was I probably would have asked for it instead of diamond.", "You know what? I\u2019m willing to bet that he did do the research. How many men do you know who know anything about gemstones? I only met one, and that\u2019s because he was briefly in the jewelry business. So he very likely looked for a cheap alternative to a diamond but wanted one that would pass enough to fool her. Moissanite would have been cheaper, beautiful, and durable but would have been recognized. He meant his lie. That\u2019s an interesting way to want to begin a marriage.", "It\u2019s a cultural norm dude. Common sense. Unless stated otherwise, a clear stone on an engagement ring is assumed to be a diamond. 87% of engagement rings are diamonds, and it used to be even higher than that. \n\nAnd to be just as idiotic as you are\u2026 where in her post did she say he told her it WASN\u2019T a diamond? See, that argument makes about as much sense as yours.\n\nOP was clearly already frustrated with her BF\u2019s behavior. It\u2019s unlikely she expected a diamond. She would have needed to get it appraised for insurance anyway if it was a diamond. He\u2019s just a cheapskate.", "That man sounds disgusting. She\u2019s better off without him.", "And again she never said he claimed it was a diamond. The assumption that he was trying to pass it off as one is you guys making bullshit assumptions. He's not a bad person for being cheap. They just aren't compatible.", "They are not compatible. There's no question there. But the assertion that he tried to pass it off as a diamond is utter horse shit. There is no evidence that happened at all", "Exactly. If you're going to do that, fine, but be honest about it. If not, look, it may not mean that much to you, but a ring sends a message to some people, about how much the relationship means to you, and about the time and commitment you're putting into your future. When it's based on a lie, it's really, really screwed up", "Lmao you chose the last half of that sentence even though you know what OP said. He doesn\u2019t get birthday gifts, he doesn\u2019t buy her dinner on her birthday. It\u2019s also not insane for one and the other to wholly buy dinner at various outings. That is a reasonable relationship. You\u2019re reaching and you know it. You can stop looking for reasons to be sexist - there are no good ones, it\u2019s a bad look.", "Maybe I'm missing it but where does it say he pretended it was a diamond? That would of course piss me off too.", "We still can\u2019t figure out HOW she married or stayed with him for so long.", "He\u2019s a bad person for not telling her it wasn\u2019t a diamond then being upset when she found out. He\u2019s not mad she had it tested. He\u2019s mad that she figured it out.\n\nBut yes, they\u2019re incompatible. But not because he\u2019s cheap or she\u2019s a gold digger.", "I don't know anyone over 40 that wants, expects, or values diamonds.", "\"Are you new here?\" followed by a wall of misogynistic text does not add up to her opinion being equally valid to you or two things being right at the same time. \"Lol\"", "He got her a white sapphire and didn\u2019t say what it was. He wanted her to think it was a diamond.", "He's upset because she confronted him after getting it assessed and being angry that it wasn't more expensive. Not because he thought he tricked her.", "But I never said misogyny doesn't exist though. It absolutely does. But so does misandry. And both are absolutely WRONG.  I didn't invalidate anything you said. I granted it all as true because it is except for the bank accounts. Because women absolutely had bank accounts before 1974. I didn't attack you or anyone else. I did absolutely nothing to invalidate your perspective. What men and women provide to each other is equally valid.", "How was I misogynistic when I clearly said every single thing she said was valid? Where did I denigrate or insult women? I said absolutely nothing negative about women at all. Their perspective is absolutely valid.", "Hm, I guess you could see it that way."]}
