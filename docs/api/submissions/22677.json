{"id": 22677, "submission_id": "1546wsd", "title": "AITA for taking my engagement ring to get assessed professionally?", "selftext": "My bf(33M) and I(29F) have been together for 3 years. He is a very frugal person which was fine initially but now is just killing our relationship. Im quite frugal myself, I own my own apartment, my car is a Honda Fit was paid for in cash. I have no debt and I have over $240000 in retirement, assets and savings.\n\nBut he takes it to another level. If we eat out  every meal must be split between us according to who ate what and he will correct the waitress until I decide to pay more so the waitress doesn\u2019t suffer having to redo the bill. He paid for the first few dates but then never ever took me out again not even on my birthday. Never any presents other than a card and maybe a slice of cake. I bought him a nice watch for his birthday but then never got him anything at all because I was really disappointed by his gift to me. He is not poor he makes ~$70k a year in a MCOL area. He owns 3 pairs of shoes a sandal, sneaker and winter boot and nothing else even though it rains enough rain boots are necessary. It use to be very nice he was non capitalistic but now it\u2019s just annoying. When we went to vacation(after some begging on my part because he doesn\u2019t want to pay for any travel) we had to leave at 3:00 am and have a 5 hour layover because the direct flight that lets us get a decent nights rest is $200 more. Maybe it\u2019s a difference of opinion but to me being dog tired and sitting in the airport for 5 hours isn\u2019t worth the $200 saved and he refused to pay it and it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to travel separately so I doubt with it. Everything is about saving money and he refuses to go skiing or to escape rooms with me because it costs money.\n\nAnyway he got me the engagement ring and I said yes. Initially I did have reservations because of what I mentioned above but put that out of my head. He didn\u2019t give me anything associated with the ring and when a friend saw it he swore up and down it wasn\u2019t a diamond. I also am very dubious my bf would ever pay for a diamond. So I went to a jeweller got it assessed. Turns out to be a white sapphire. They told me the ring should be worth $500-800. Which is not a problem on its own but the fact he wouldn\u2019t even spend much money on an engagement ring just makes me question how I\u2019m expected to live with him in the future. He rent but lives in a terrible place to save money, will I be expected to live like that? \n\nI brought it up with him later and he got furious and accused me of being a golddigger for checking the ring. I kept telling him it\u2019s just one of the many problems I have tried to talk about with him regarding  his spending and he just accused me of trying to cover up that I wanted an expensive ring. I\u2019m being made to feel like a villain for not being happy about the ring and how much I\u2019m expected to sacrifice because of his frugality.

For many women it\u2019s the nicest piece of jewelry they own, or even the only really nice piece they own.

But I read this and think, for you, the ring pretty much symbolizes everything problematic with this relationship.  You seem fundamentally incompatible. You probably need to take a good, hard look at the last three years and ask yourself if this is how you want to spend the next 50 years.  He is not likely to modify his frugality at this point in his life.\n\nWe all like to think that love is enough to make a good marriage.  It\u2019s not.  It provides the foundation for finding a way to mesh our lives, our individuality, all the things that make us singular and unique into a unit.

You definitely didn't need to do this, although I would suggest rethinking if you should get married to him. Perhaps you shouldn't have said yes if you're this financially incompatible, an issue that is one of the top reasons in divorce statistics.\n\nHonestly the whole \"spend as much as you can\" on a ring or wedding has never made sense to me when there are way more important things, like a healthy relationship and marriage. My ring and wedding were extremely affordable, which I requested because I wanted to save for a house instead.

I bought him a nice watch for his birthday but then never got him anything at all because I was really disappointed by his gift to me. He is not poor he makes ~$70k a year in a MCOL area. He owns 3 pairs of shoes, sandals, sneakers and winter boots and nothing else. It use to be very nice he was no non capitalistic but now it\u2019s just annoying. When we went to vacation we had to leave at 3:00 am and have a 5 hour layover because the direct flight that lets us get a decent nights rest is $200 more. Maybe it\u2019s a difference of opinion but being dog tired and sitting in the airport is worth the $200 and he refused to pay it and it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to travel separately so I doubt with it. Everything is about saving money and he refuses to go skiing or to escape rooms with me because it costs money.\n\nAnyway he got me the engagement ring and I said yes. Initially I did have reservations because of what I mentioned above but put that out of my head. He didn\u2019t give me anything associated with the ring and when a friend saw it he swore up and down it wasn\u2019t a diamond. I also am very dubious my bf would ever pay for a diamond. So I went to a jeweller got it assessed. Turns out to be a white sapphire. Which is not a problem on its own but the fact he wouldn\u2019t even spend much money on an engagement ring just makes me question how I\u2019m expected to live with him in the future. He rent but lives in a terrible place to save money, will I be expected to live like that? \n\nI brought it up with him later and he got furious and accused me of being a golddigger for checking the ring. I kept telling him it\u2019s just one of the many problems with his I will mess to spend any money and he just accused me of trying to cover up that I wanted an expensive ring. I\u2019m being made to feel like a villain for not being happy about the ring and how much I\u2019m expected to sacrifice because of his frugality.

I can\u2019t imagine having kids with this person. Good luck to you. \n\nNTA. Get out now.", "Don\u2019t listen to boozebag, clearly a bitter, angry soul. You\u2019re not asking for too much, in fact you deserve much more. You won\u2019t be happy if you marry this guy.", "As someone who got married for a multitude of reasons, but age being one of them\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s not worth it. 29 isn\u2019t old. There is not a set parameter of how to live life. You get to make up your own. \n\nThe two of you are not compatible. It sounds like this needs to be the natural end to this chapter. Life is too short to make all the compromises and ultimately be miserable. I wasted more than a decade. Were there good times? Sure. But I sacrificed so much of my well-being and happiness for someone who was unwilling to compromise for mine. \n\nBreak up, go on the trips you desire and have earned. You have already set up such a wonderful and successful life for yourself. The right partner will come along, and trust this: you will undoubtedly know when it\u2019s right. Oh, and marriage in general in bullshit. You can be committed to someone without the state becoming involved. I\u2019ve been stuck in divorce purgatory for years, and it\u2019s so insanely easy to get married. Not so much to get unmarried. Protect your assets, and definitely do a prenup if you decide to marry.", "Listen, this is an absolutely terrible reason to get married. You want a family? Do you think he's going to be better when there is the expense of a child or children in this mix? Do you want to fight every time your kid needs new clothes, or wants to play a sport, or needs tuition for college? Do you think you will ever be able to go on vacation again?\n\nI think this is a NAH situation, but you two are not at all on the same page about money and nothing will ruin a relationship quicker than money issues (I mean your relationship is already bad but you see what I mean).\n\nNeither one of you seem to want this relationship. PLEASE do not get married!", "Please don\u2019t settle just because you are getting older. This will probably only get worse", "Never get into a relationship thinking the other party will change.\n\nHe's told you who he is. Believe him. Stay with him and get married if that's what you want from a partner. Give him his ring back and end the relationship if you want something else.", "He's not frugal, he's cheap. It doesn't sound like you want to live that way and he's treating you as a consolation prize. Find someone who loves you and not someone who settles for you.", "INFO: This is what the rest of your life is going to be like... is this what you want / can you live with this?\n\nIf not, you still have time to find another partner and start a family, if you don't waste anymore time on this guy...", "You're only 29 and have plenty of time to find someone who's a better match. I get that you might want to marry and have kids soon, but that doesn't mean you should rush into things and marry someone who obviously isn't right for you. \n\nA marriage with two people who seem so incompatible and have such different goals and priorities is highly unlikely to last. \n\nI rushed into a similar thing around your age only for it all to quickly crumble and leave me childless and single in my late 30s. Had I gone with my gut and not wasted so many years, that might not be the case. Trust your instinct and don't settle just for the sake of getting married.", "So how do you think he's going to be with kids? Suddenly discover his generous fun side, enjoy taking them to new places, buying toys for them, paying for music lessons maybe, or encouraging them to try different sports?\n\nYou're going to be the pregnant woman wearing his tee shirts and stretched out leggings, because he'll make a fuss if you even  want maternity clothes!", "Even De Beers only said 1/4 and they\u2019re the most predatory diamond people on the planet \ud83d\ude02", "That's fair. I was slightly hyperbolic, but you know what I meant. The expectation that you're supposed to buy her a \"big rock\" is highly prevalent.", "Right but insurance is not required or something that everyone does. And OP didn\u2019t do it because she was trying to get it insured so your argument doesn\u2019t apply?", "Thank you.  Like how do people just assume getting an appraisal is shitty behavior?", "I stand by what I said? Literally none of my friends got their rings appraised and I have at least 3 friends plus myself who recently were either engaged or married. (I literally just texted around to make sure I didn\u2019t misspeak but lo and behold,\nno one of us did.) \n\nMaybe it\u2019s common for more expensive rings or heirlooms, but a lot of people just don\u2019t, especially if the ring is under a certain price point.", "My ex freaked out when I got pregnant. And it was a planned pregnancy too.. He was always frugal but then suddenly money was all he cared about. To the point he made me feel guilty for buying maternity clothing, or things we needed for the baby. It was awful.", "This is true haha. The three months salary thing came from diamond marketing, most people don\u2019t spend that much.\n\nFor anyone who is curious, [here](https://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-ideas/engagement-ring-cost) is some information on engagement rings. Apparently only 32% of buyers spent about two months salary on it. The average spent is still $5,000.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s been true for a really long time outside of maybe television shows. Far more common in real life is women who are absolutely terrified of saying even the most mild negative thing about their ring, even in the case of that woman who went viral for the laughably absurd red ring, lest they be accused of being frivolous, materialistic magpies who care more about a money and ring than their man. \n\nThat\u2019s crazy. For some history, women weren\u2019t allowed to open bank accounts in the US until 1974. Engagement rings were a means of women holding some amount of wealth since we were denied it. It was insurance for many women. Also, when you are asking a woman to marry you, consider what you are asking for. If you want a family you\u2019re asking that she risk her health, her life, and her personal financial prosperity, to have your children. If you\u2019re asking a man or a woman, you\u2019re asking them to stay with only you, even if things are catastrophically bad, even if you\u2019re changing their diapers. That\u2019s a huge request. It warrants a huge display to show the seriousness, sacrificing the same chunk of money you\u2019d sacrifice on a flatscreen is really the *least* you can do.", "I was responding to the comment that op is an asshole for getting an appraisal. It\u2019s not out of the realm of sensible behavior to get an appraisal, was my point. Their motivation for doing so may have been due to disappointment or lack of something in the relationship, but someone getting a ring appraised isn\u2019t automatically suspect. She had no reason to know that it was a $500 ring. If she wanted to get it appraised, she\u2019s not an asshole, was my argument.", "Also to clarify\u2014 I don\u2019t think getting a ring appraised ever at all is asshole behavior (the insurance thing is a legit motivation, for example.) Just that sneaking behind your fianc\u00e9s back to appraise it so that you can prove they\u2019re being cheap\u2026 if it\u2019s bad enough that you\u2019re suspicious and considering it, you\u2019ve got bigger problems with your relationship and there are less polarizing ways to handle them.", "I\u2019ve heard the average person today spends 2 weeks salary", "Are you new here? I've seen several posts just in this sub alone about engagement rings. Women absolutely had bank accounts before 1974, that hyperbole in your side this time lol. It was not insurance, because most women either went back to their families, remarried, or inherited the husbands property. As for that last part, men risk just as much as women in a marriage. He risks his health, cause \"protect and provide\" right? Why are men expected to walk on the outside of the sidewalk when he's with a woman? Because if a car jumps the curb, he's supposed to get hit first. He's putting his financial prosperity front and center from the start, during, and sometimes even after the marriage. Especially today when a lot of women have children from previous relationships that are a part of the package. I say that to in no way diminish what women bring to the table. But what men bring is equally valid. No one is talking about pricey wedding bands for husbands lol. Like I'm not trying to be a dick or anything, but in today's modern society, it just seems really entitled to me to expect a really pricey ring. Just my opinion. Your opinion is equally valid. Two things can be right at the same time lol.", "Right, and I\u2019m responding to that\u2014 if you\u2019re concerned your partners a cheapskate, I think it\u2019s a much more honest move to just ask or confront them on it, rather than going behind their back and getting it appraised specifically to prove your point (not for insurance.)", "I\u2019ve never heard that but I think it\u2019s sounds fair if you\u2019re putting a rule of thumb on it. Enough that you have to save up, not enough that you\u2019d be going into debt or missing a mortgage, probably the same you\u2019d be willing to spend on any other nice purchase you expect to last and be of good quality.", "[Learn](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/when-could-women-open-a-bank-account/) history [please](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/04/the-strange-and-formerly-sexist-economics-of-engagement-rings/255434/#). I\u2019m honestly not going to do this with someone who thinks having children is the same level as walking next to the road or doesn\u2019t acknowledge misogyny exists. Most women have jobs now, in case you\u2019re confused, we support and provide too. When did you give birth last? And women\u2019s lifetime earnings go down with every child, mens [go up](https://www.stlouisfed.org/en/publications/regional-economist/april-2002/for-love-or-money-why-married-men-make-more#:~:text=Beyond%20love%20and%20commitment%2C%20however,education%2C%20age%20and%20other%20factors.) when they get married, so that ring will probably pay for itself."]}
