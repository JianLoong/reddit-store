My dad died when I was 5. He and mom were separated but not divorced when he passed away and mom started dating my stepdad a few weeks later. I met him about five months after my dad died, and he moved in with us after a year and they married 14 months after that. My mom really wanted me to \"have a dad\" and found my stepdad a good partner and someone who could be a good dad to me. Only I never wanted another dad. So I always called him by his first name and refer to him as my stepdad. He and I have butted heads over this a lot. He thinks I should be his daddy's little girl. I think it's crazy that he feels I owe him that, and owed him from the start. It annoys me how often he likes to bring up that my dad's dead and the fact I hardly remember him, because a lot of my memories faded with time, and when I was 7 my grandpa died, who raised my dad after my grandma died when dad was a baby. So I lost all contact with that side.\n\nThe older I get, the worse it gets and even with three boys, he's still focused on me being his little girl. I have told him that I appreciate him but I won't ever call him dad.\n\nI spent a lot of time with mom's parents as a kid and have a bedroom at their house. We had Christmas at their house this year and all morning my stepdad was bringing up these stories of adult stepkids asking stepparents to adopt them and on and on and told me I would be asking him soon enough after all these years. He found this article on FB about a woman asking her stepmom to adopt her, where she talked about it being insulting to call her stepmom, because she was always a mom to her. He said that was him with me, how I only ever had him as a dad, etc. It got on my nerves. I told him to stop, so did grandma who told him nobody wanted to hear about that at Christmas. But he would not let up.\n\nSo I went up to my room at my grandparents, grabbed some old art supplies I still had there, and made a sign that said Jason (stepdad's \"name\", you ARE NOT the father of Gracie (me). Think the Maury show and how that was like a meme for a while. When dinner was ready I brought down the sign and gave it to him and told him whenever he needs to remember, he can look at it and adjust his expectations. He was pissed. My grandparents and half brothers laughed. The oldest of my brothers actually said his dad needed something like that because he never seemed to understand it. My mom tried to calm him down but he told me I was an ungrateful and disrespectful little girl who would be sad when he finally gives up caring about me. I told him I never asked him to be a dick to me but to accept I will never call him dad and will never allow him to adopt me. I told him we could be close if he'd just accept I don't see him as my dad.\n\nMy mom wants me to apologize but my grandparents think he should apologize for always pushing.

This is a tragedy and he will never, ever be replaced in your heart or life. Tragically, your father never had the chance to raise you, and this leaves a hole in every child\u2019s life that you\u2019ll basically feel in perpetuity. You will naturally feel resentment and defensive of your deceased father because you hold his memory and role in your life very sacred, and no one dare infringe upon that. \n\nYour step dad came into your life, and even though you didn\u2019t ask for it, he stepped up to be there for you\u2026 in so many ways that you\u2019ll never count and don\u2019t even probably know. Even if he is wont leave this issue alone\u2026 it sounds like he deeply cares about you and just desires to be close to you after all this time. He definitely doesn\u2019t understand what it is like to lose a parent so young, and frankly, no explaining will ever truly make someone understand. but he isn\u2019t doing any of this because he wants to hurt you, replace your memory of your father, or any sort of malice. He is doing it because even though he isn\u2019t your father, he is your dad and helped to raise you for 15 years. He loves you, and he is just looking for some sort of validation to the role that he has performed in your life for so long. He wants you to be his daughter, and he naturally desires a little reciprocation and for you to just call him dad. \n\nThis circumstance is incredible painful for both of you. You lost one or the most important people in your life, and even years of therapy will hardly chip away at all of the very sophisticated hurt and traumas that surround this for you. But to intentionally do something so malicious and hurtful to the man who did help raise you, in front of the family, even if you view his desires as disrespectful to your fathers memory\u2026 those are two different intentions. He wants to be close to you. You want to remind him of his distant place in your life. And for that reason - I believe YTA as you haven\u2019t processed your traumas yet and are acting maliciously toward someone who has only done right by you. \n\nIt is so so incredibly difficult to be a step parent. Parenting alone is hard, but to be a step parent is much harder. If I were you, I\u2019d go easier on him and work on accepting that you can have two dads, but only one father.

They have a wonderful relationship with their bio mom, and the boys spend 50/50 time with each side of the family. I know they feel protective of her, and me trying to force them to call me \u201cmom\u201d or hear me calling them my sons would only erode the relationship we\u2019ve built together and drive a wedge between all of us. I wish they felt more comfortable with using that language toward me, but I have to respect their needs.

Those were HER choices, and she's 100% entitled to make them, i have 0 problem with it. The man married her MOTHER, he didn't ADOPT her, and she's made it completely clear that she DOESN'T want that, nor that distinction, nor to be treated like a daughter. So if he treated her like she was someone elses child (which she is) why would that not be ok? Just because a man marries a woman with children, as CLEARLY evidenced by this thread, it doesn't make those children HIS, so why should they be treated, as if they were his, when they're not? if it's not ok to do that, then it isn't ok to treat someone who's not your dad, like he's not your dad right?", "Hi, former caseworker that is not soap opera. The parent dies surviving parent gets life insurance and the kid gets survivor benefits. A man comes along and sees a woman who \"needs\" a man and inserts himself.

You\u2019re clearly looking for unhealthy discourse. Good day.", "The life insurance policy is a good point, but as you noted OP's dad might not have had one. OP did not mention location and 1Preschoolteacher did not qualify with a location, so it is possible that OP grew up in a place that does not have social security or an equivalent scheme.

Most kids would actively resent anyone trying to replace a parent so quickly.

Geez you have patience.\n\nSorry he didn't just enjoy your relationship instead of so much focus on a specific title. Your bio-dad deserves to be remembered too.

Everything about your relationship is inappropriate: not respecting boundaries, picking at the trauma of your losing your dad, pushing his needs as the adult above yours as the child, perpetuating this into your adulthood, refusing to listen to your perspective repeatedly. Never apologize. He wanted to replace your dad, but it didn\u2019t work. I wonder if one of your brothers had turned out to be a sister if he would have let you off the hook for not being daddy\u2019s little girl (which is just icky).

He isn't listening to you and all you are doing is trying to get him to stop harassing you about it.

The sign was a great idea given he plainly struggles to integrate verbally communicated information. \n\n\\[If you have addressed this in the comments I apologise, I did look but couldn't see anything, but there are too many now to read them all!\\] \n\nI'm wondering, have you tried to independently reach out to your father's side of the family? You say that you lost contact, I'm assuming because your mother and stepfather refused to allow any contact as part of their effort to erase him from your life, and when you are a young child there isn't much you can do in those circumstances. \n\nBut you are 20, and I saw in a comment that you have moved out and so are independent now. They can no longer stop you re-establishing a relationship with those relatives if you want to. Did your father have older siblings? I'm sure they would love to hear from you (if you haven't been in touch already).\n\nThis will also solve the wedding problem raised in some of the other comments below. Your stepfather probably does expect to walk you down the aisle. It would be a neat way to make it clear once and for all that you are your father's daughter if a relative from your father's side were to walk you down the aisle instead.
