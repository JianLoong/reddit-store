{"id": 18645, "submission_id": "13wrthr", "title": "AITA for not upgrading my sister to a suite with the rest of our siblings?", "selftext": "This summer my siblings and I (32f) had the opportunity to take a vacation together, something we have not been able to do in the past due to our time and scheduling conflicts as we\u2019re all busy with work/school/family life.  There\u2019s 5 of us, I\u2019m the oldest and married, and my younger brother (28m) had a week off of work that he asked us to help him plan something for. \n\nWe all decided to take an all inclusive week long vacation that my younger sister (30f) found a good deal for which was within all of our price range. I\u2019m sharing a room with one sibling, my brothers are sharing another room, and my younger sister (30f) is in a room by herself. All the planning and details went smoothly until I received an email last week that we were eligible to bid for an upgrade to a better room/status. The upgrade would include unlimited drinks and dining at all the restaurants (not just the ones included with our original basic room package) and access to the VIP lounges. I ended up impulsively putting in a bid for myself and, because I had done the booking for my younger brothers, put a bid in for them as well. To my surprise our bids were accepted immediately, something I wasn\u2019t expecting. I called my younger sister to tell her to place a bid for an upgrade as well and, becuase it was expensive, offered to pay for half of her upgrade. \n\nIt\u2019s been two days now and it doesn\u2019t look like her bid was accepted. We called the resort and they said the status we were upgraded to has been fully booked, her room level is now 3 grades below ours with a separate dining area, separate amenities and it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019ll be allowed in to the VIP lounges we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve tried to think of ways to sneak her in to our lounges/restaurants but she\u2019s acting like we left her behind and has become mopey and sad. She\u2019s making sarcastic comments about keeping to herself in her \u201cpoor person section\u201d and it\u2019s making everyone feel guilty. The whole trip was initially her idea and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem but her own if she didn\u2019t get the upgrade like the rest of us. I\u2019m stressed now that this will ruin our vacation together. AITA here for upgrading to a nicer room?\n\n\n\n\nEditUPDATE:\n\nYou guys are ridiculous, nothing I said should have been offensive. I talked to my sister and she agreed that she wants us all to have a nice vacation and yes, she\u2019s pouting constantly over feeling left out, but we are all going on the same vacation. She expressed that we should enjoy the amenities we paid for. I told her we\u2019d try to include her and she could come to our rooms and enjoy the butler service and I\u2019d order her any drinks she wanted when she was with us so she wouldn\u2019t have to pay for them herself as the upgrades included unlimited drinks. I should add that we\u2019re all adults and no one plans to spend every waking moment of a family vacation together. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok for her to act so clingy all of a sudden when she was the first to suggest that she would be ok with a room to herself. It\u2019s ALL of our vacation and not just hers. \n\nFor those asking, I couldn\u2019t bid on her upgrade, she had to do that herself because she paid for her own reservation on a separate account. The rooms are a maximum of 2 people per room. I didn\u2019t think we would get the upgrade as I bid the minimum amount for mine and my brothers rooms. Which brings me to the nature of placing a bid: there\u2019s no guarantee that it will win. I was caught by surprise when our bids were accepted and brought it up to my sister as soon as I found out we got in. My sister is also usually on a budget and I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be interested in the upgrade anyway when I placed the bids. I had no way to know, or predict, that she would be down for it. \n\nI think it\u2019s pretty crazy for everyone here to blow this out of proportion in this way. Unhinged might be a better word for individuals who can\u2019t put themselves in my shoes.", "created_utc": 1685552498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wrthr/aita_for_not_upgrading_my_sister_to_a_suite_with/", "score": 2512, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you couldn\u2019t coordinate doing the upgrades together, you should not have tried doing it for just your room and your brothers.

The level of selfishness to do something for all but one family member and then blame them for missing out is just breathtaking.", "YTA if you plan on using the \"exclusive\" restaurants and lounges and whatever other amenities outside of your individual rooms. You're basically forcing your sister to vacation alone, which isn't what she signed up for.....", "YTA\n\nThe only acceptable way to fix this mistake is either: \n\n1. Only spend the vacation in areas that *all* members of the family are allowed to visit (i.e. non-VIP areas). \n\n2.

You will have family vacation without her?", "YTA- she found the hotel and you only after the fact told her to place her bid. The moment you were doing it you should have told her as well.

Did you have to do the booking to put in the bid? Did you ask the hotel if you could extend the bid to your sister and explain the circumstances?  \n\n In retrospect it would have been wise to immediately check with your sister and see if she too had been offered the chance to bid. That could have decided the issue before you placed a bid. At this point, you are separated from your sister in dining and other amenities. If it were me I would either reject the upgrade in favor of being together or approach the hotel manager, explain the circumstances, and ask if there is any way to pay to upgrade your sister as well.\n\nToo bad damage has already been done.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even the unlimited drinks and dining is a bit unfair bc hotel restaurant food and drinks are overpriced and sister is going to be paying out the butt for food everyone else will be getting for free.

It\u2019s really rude to be staying in separate rooms with such an upgrade difference. \n\nI suggest you get a refund on the upgrade to have the same level as your sister or find another resort.

But still, not a malicious action on your part. I can see why she feels a way, but it doesn't mean you all are going to spend all your time in these spots and leave her hanging.

She may be chill with that.", "Technically it wouldn\u2019t be the same deal that you and your brothers got, but she can still pay for the all the stuff. It\u2019s pretty normal to do so at an all inclusive resort. She may have to be in another suite from you guys but for the lounges, food, drinks, etc, she can still get. You guys should help her pay.\n\nBut you also should have told her the moment you got the email for the upgrade that you\u2019re apply and she should too.", "YTA. Either pay to get her into whatever the upgrade has or refund and go to lower tier or not go to any of the VIP stuff at all. It's really not that hard to think about.

Now you're leaving her out, because she won't have access to all of those areas since you only got the upgrade for you and your brothers.\n\nNot to mention, she found the whole deal for everyone else before.", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you put a bid in for her at the same time OR wait until you spoke to her so you could all do it together and not risk someone not getting it? Seems like common sense to me.

Either downgrade yourself back to where you were or figure out a way she can join you.", "YTA Well I do not see how she\u2019s going to enjoy herself when you took a risk that could not pan out for every single one of you.  I feel sorry for her. In my opinion I would not feel right leaving a sibling out like that. I think your impulse was not well thought out. Selfish.  How is it her fault she didn\u2019t get the upgrade? What did she do wrong? The whole trip was to be together?

If you want to make this right, ask if she can stay in your room as part of your package for an extra fee, or rebook at the lower price. The whole \"teehee maybe you can sneak in\" is just emphasizing that she's separate from you, so knock it off and work on leveling the playing field.\n\nOr you could double down and say hey, three siblings is enough for me. It's not like she's important to you, right?", "YTA 100%. First of all, if you receive an email like that you either \nA.

You submitted for 4 and got accepted, not bought straight up but auction bid almost. Anyone with half a brain understands that the more you look to buy the better price you\u2019ll get, and the supply of them most likely diminished from others with that email. Now, your sister has to only bid for 1 ticket, with a shorter supply and an asking price range that has probably grown substantially. \n\nNot to mention, what was your plan here if they were accepted and your sister couldn\u2019t get one?

Unless your comparing apples to apples then it\u2019s hard to give accurate advice. \n\nUsually when higher priced packages don\u2019t sell they offer them to the next tier of bookings, which opens up those rooms.  The telling piece is that OP\u2019s rooms are now 3 levels higher than the sister.

No you wouldn\u2019t, you\u2019d be upset and sad.

You did leave her behind.  4 of you will be off hanging out together in the VIP areas, going to the fancy restaurants and lounges while she's going to be stuck sitting in her room by herself, after planning this whole siblings trip.  How is that not ruined?  Honestly, don't be shocked if she drops out at this point.  I wouldn't want to go on a vacation that I'd made a point of planning when I knew all my siblings were just going to ditch me when we got there and leave me by myself, why waste the money to go and sit and eat alone?", "There's already 4 of you in the VIP.

The sister did nothing wrong, yet OP is fully ready to say \"tough shit\" and exclude her. \n\nI don't know about you, but I'm eating and partying in areas where all my siblings can access - especially the sibling who did the work to make the trip happen. If OP choses to stay in \"VIP\" all my herself, that is a choice she is free to make.", "Yeah, I would bow out if I was sister. It\u2019s one thing to try to get an upgrade to a bigger hotel room or use your status to get business class flights, but when an upgrade means that you are now going to be separated from other members of the group, you don\u2019t put in for it without having a conversation with everyone about what happens if you don\u2019t all get it. If they had taken that route, OP probably could\u2019ve put in a bid in for all three of them. She likely only needed sister\u2019s confirmation number in order to put in a bid for her as long as OP committed to paying for it, which she could certainly square up with her sister later. If they have had a conversation first, calls could\u2019ve been made to the resort to figure out how to put in bids for three reservations to ensure that everyone gets it or no one does.\n\nI frankly wouldn\u2019t go at this point. Everyone is so excited to have gotten the upgrades, that if I\u2019m the reason they end up having to cancel them, I don\u2019t want to sit around an entire vacation with my siblings, all looking longingly at the VIP areas where they could have been. I also would not be feeling great about this trip that my siblings were treating it as my own fault that my bid was not accepted. If I put in a bid that was similar to what my siblings had put in, and it wasn\u2019t accepted, well, then that means that the resort had gotten enough takers or bids from other people that beat mine out. OP was not the only person offered this deal.

That's what we would do in my family. \n\n(I was actually discussing a situation like this earlier today where one of my siblings had to pay a lot more than the rest of us on a trip  because he is a different nationality than us. My other sibling and I split the cost so we could essentially all pay the same thing, because the trip wouldn't have been the same without our brother, neither did we want it to be significantly more of a financial burden on him than on the rest of us.

She literally brought it up to her sister and offered to pay for half before finding out they are sold out. I think she should have waited to do the upgrade until everyone agreed and then everyone can do it at once. \n\nI don't think messing that up though means she hates her sister and did this on purpose, just that she needs to rethink her process for stuff like this in the future to avoid running into the same problem.", "Did you read the part where OP said the sister wasn\u2019t going to be \u201callowed in the VIP rooms we\u2019re in\u201d?

Why come to Reddit to ask AITA, then when you get a resounding \"Yes, YTA\", you decide to accuse everyone else of being unhinged?! You're the one coming across as unhinged!\n\nIt's also interesting that it was this same sister whose idea it was to even go on this trip; it was this same sister who found a good deal for ALL of you to benefit...... but when it was time to bid for upgrades, it was this same sister that you excluded *\"because she's usually on a budget\"*. Why didn't you tell her about the upgrades the moment you found out & applied for everybody else? Wasn't that the whole point of going on this family trip?\n\nLet me explain to you what you did: - Imagine if your sister, when she found this good deal for the vacation, proceeded to book it, along with this deal, for everyone except you. Then after it's been confirmed, & they've received all the details (tickets, hotel rooms, perks etc), only then does she inform you about the deal. You then proceed to try to also book the vacation with this deal, but by then, it's no longer available. You then have to book in a cheaper hotel, as you couldn't afford the same one due to cost. You're also unable to access the 5  hotel or high-end restaurants that your siblings got as part of this deal, couldn't enter the hotel bars, and weren't allowed to use the complimentary car for transportation, that was also part of the deal. If this happened to you, would YOU enjoy the vacation?\n\nYou sound like a rather unpleasant person. The fact that you're this obtuse, that you can't see (1) how wrong this is, and (2) the fact that you're actually the cause of it. Even if you couldn't bid for an upgrade for your sister, why couldn't you tell her about it immediately you found out and bid for everyone else? What exactly did you think was going to happen?!", "YTA. \n\nYour edit made it 100% worse. You\u2019re mad they we\u2019re giving our opinion. If I got an upgrade my sister didn\u2019t get, I\u2019d tell them I\u2019d rather just save my money and give it to someone else. It\u2019s a fucking family vacation. You\u2019re being insensitive and kind of a brat to be honest.", "At first it seemed like a N A H possibly, because you told her right away, or so it would appear, but then your edit proves that you\u2019re a massive AH, so definitely saying YTA.

That makes YTA without a doubt.\n\nIt was her idea yet she\u2019s getting excluded from restaurants and amenities. She really shouldn\u2019t even go at all because you\u2019re clearly not going to be doing things as a group/family, which defeats the whole point.
