There\u2019s 5 of us, I\u2019m the oldest and married, and my younger brother (28m) had a week off of work that he asked us to help him plan something for. \n\nWe all decided to take an all inclusive week long vacation that my younger sister (30f) found a good deal for which was within all of our price range. I\u2019m sharing a room with one sibling, my brothers are sharing another room, and my younger sister (30f) is in a room by herself. All the planning and details went smoothly until I received an email last week that we were eligible to bid for an upgrade to a better room/status. The upgrade would include unlimited drinks and dining at all the restaurants (not just the ones included with our original basic room package) and access to the VIP lounges. I ended up impulsively putting in a bid for myself and, because I had done the booking for my younger brothers, put a bid in for them as well. To my surprise our bids were accepted immediately, something I wasn\u2019t expecting. I called my younger sister to tell her to place a bid for an upgrade as well and, becuase it was expensive, offered to pay for half of her upgrade. \n\nIt\u2019s been two days now and it doesn\u2019t look like her bid was accepted. We called the resort and they said the status we were upgraded to has been fully booked, her room level is now 3 grades below ours with a separate dining area, separate amenities and it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019ll be allowed in to the VIP lounges we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve tried to think of ways to sneak her in to our lounges/restaurants but she\u2019s acting like we left her behind and has become mopey and sad. She\u2019s making sarcastic comments about keeping to herself in her \u201cpoor person section\u201d and it\u2019s making everyone feel guilty. The whole trip was initially her idea and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem but her own if she didn\u2019t get the upgrade like the rest of us. I\u2019m stressed now that this will ruin our vacation together.

Thanks for the tip!  Wait, why are you sad?  Don\u2019t you realize you are ruining this for us?\n\nCall the resort.

Your sister put all of the effort into finding the deal, and it sounds like she got her own room as the \u2018reward\u2019 instead of sharing, but then you upgraded everyone but her - so you all are going to have exclusive access to everywhere in your booking class, and she will be extra alone and excluded. If you couldn\u2019t coordinate doing the upgrades together, you should not have tried doing it for just your room and your brothers.

You have already ruined the vacation, so no need to stress. You excluded the person who planned the trip from virtually everything. The level of selfishness to do something for all but one family member and then blame them for missing out is just breathtaking.", "YTA if you plan on using the \"exclusive\" restaurants and lounges and whatever other amenities outside of your individual rooms. You're basically forcing your sister to vacation alone, which isn't what she signed up for.....", "YTA\n\nThe only acceptable way to fix this mistake is either: \n\n1. Only spend the vacation in areas that *all* members of the family are allowed to visit (i.e. non-VIP areas). \n\n2. All chip in to upgrade your sister's booking to VIP status and all enjoy the VIP areas (still at a discount: 1 full-price VIP room vs. 3)", "YTA she went through all the planning of this trip and is now not even on the same floor as everyone else. Give her your upgraded room and see how that feels", "YTA. Why didn't you put in a bid for your sister? Are you going to eat apart from her every meal and use separate amenities? What is the point of a family trip if she is kept apart from most aspects of it? Your sister will not get over this and nor should she.

Your sister found a great deal so you could all vacation together. But when it was time to get a free upgrade, you left her behind.

You should never have tried to get the upgrade unless you were sure everyone could also get it.  Now it\u2019s not really a family vacation is it? Hopefully you can decline the upgrade and get your original rooms back and salvage the vacation.", "Surely if you explain the situation to the resort and offer to pay, they will be able to scrounge up the VIP pass for the extra drinks or whatever.

You are going on vacation together and if there are things she's excluded from that's pretty cold. You could have bid for her as well or not bid at all if you couldn't also bid for her.

You will have family vacation without her?", "YTA- she found the hotel and you only after the fact told her to place her bid. The moment you were doing it you should have told her as well.

That could have decided the issue before you placed a bid. At this point, you are separated from your sister in dining and other amenities. If it were me I would either reject the upgrade in favor of being together or approach the hotel manager, explain the circumstances, and ask if there is any way to pay to upgrade your sister as well.\n\nToo bad damage has already been done.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How long did she wait to do the bid?", "So, your sister found a good deal that suited everyone, but when you got the offer of an upgrade you applied and included your brother but not the sister who had found the good deal in the first place?  \n\n\nWhat was your question again?  Are you the AH? Too darn rooting you\u2019re an AH.

If you want to make this right, ask if she can stay in your room as part of your package for an extra fee, or rebook at the lower price. The whole \"teehee maybe you can sneak in\" is just emphasizing that she's separate from you, so knock it off and work on leveling the playing field.\n\nOr you could double down and say hey, three siblings is enough for me.

Unless your comparing apples to apples then it\u2019s hard to give accurate advice. \n\nUsually when higher priced packages don\u2019t sell they offer them to the next tier of bookings, which opens up those rooms.  The telling piece is that OP\u2019s rooms are now 3 levels higher than the sister.

It\u2019s one thing to try to get an upgrade to a bigger hotel room or use your status to get business class flights, but when an upgrade means that you are now going to be separated from other members of the group, you don\u2019t put in for it without having a conversation with everyone about what happens if you don\u2019t all get it. If they had taken that route, OP probably could\u2019ve put in a bid in for all three of them. She likely only needed sister\u2019s confirmation number in order to put in a bid for her as long as OP committed to paying for it, which she could certainly square up with her sister later.

I also would not be feeling great about this trip that my siblings were treating it as my own fault that my bid was not accepted. If I put in a bid that was similar to what my siblings had put in, and it wasn\u2019t accepted, well, then that means that the resort had gotten enough takers or bids from other people that beat mine out. OP was not the only person offered this deal. Not to mention, frequently those resorts are already charging an exorbitant amount of money for a single person to stay in a room because they are missing out on the double occupancy they could be getting.

That is proper reddiquette when you edit a comment to correct a mistake.  \n\nOtherwise, if I just deleted my blunder, it's like I am covering it up.", "She knows what she did. She hates her younger sister...she did this on purpose", "OP is TA because she doesn\u2019t have any intention whatsoever to decline the upgrades, much less doing what you are suggesting. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem but her own\u201d says OP. OP, YTA.", "Oh no that probably meant all the upgrades were all taken then she told her, the sis probably had no chance for upgrade then", "If only humans had some kind of limbs to move themselves into the same location as other humans and muscles in our necks to create sounds to communicate. Or even some kind of technology to pass information across distances beyond visual range. Then OP's sibling could have put in a bid at the same time to avoid this whole issue.", "How could op place the bid for their sister when they didn't book the room?", "Yep she either should have bid for her sister or called her immediately to let her know!", "This is an insane take. She literally brought it up to her sister and offered to pay for half before finding out they are sold out. I think she should have waited to do the upgrade until everyone agreed and then everyone can do it at once. \n\nI don't think messing that up though means she hates her sister and did this on purpose, just that she needs to rethink her process for stuff like this in the future to avoid running into the same problem.", "Did you read the part where OP said the sister wasn\u2019t going to be \u201callowed in the VIP rooms we\u2019re in\u201d?  And \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem but her own\u201d?\n\nYeah, really altruistic <sic>.  Even if you think she wasn\u2019t being an asshole for booking the room without her sister, she\u2019s being an asshole now.", "Yeah, even they couldn't upgrade the room because it was all booked, the resort would probably let them have VIP access and stuff that there aren't any limited capacity especially if you pay for it. They usually have flexibility of that sort for accidental situations like this. \nI've got like free upgrades to a disability room when I was injured and in crutches,  or when a business room was unbooked late night and possibly not going to anymore that day.", "Don\u2019t wait to talk to the front desk upon arrival. Call them now to find out what your options are lol", "She told her later after she booked for herself and brothers, causing her to miss out. She should have booked it and then said pay me half. She had an motive in her mind. Maybe hate is a strong word but she did do a ahole move here", "Sister got them the vaca, but now she gets the credit for getting them the VIP", "In any case, OP should resolve this before the vacation. Make an international call if needed - but don't show up at the front desk expecting them to accommodate you, and with no certainty that the sister is going to be able to enjoy the vacation she made sure the rest of the group could have. If I were the sister, and I knew all my siblings had decided to leave me out of the vacation I planned, I doubt I'd want to go at all. OP should definitely try and resolve this *before* any of them get on a plane.", "I'd imagine the VIP sections are just a different colored wristband or something that can be purchased separately from the upgraded room.", "They already tried that. I'm saying as a last resort try in person where it's easier for someone to feel bad for you than over the phone.", "Oh, I was just replying to the comment that OP with her brothers could poo togetherl a larger bid than sister by herself. I don't actually know if that's what they did or if OP actually paid for the brother's bids without getting paid back.", "All true.", "Fair enough. I think this whole thing is pretty messed up \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah, I replied elsewhere that OP should try to get sister club access or cancel their upgrade since this vacation is supposed to be together"]}
