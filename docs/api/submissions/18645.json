There\u2019s 5 of us, I\u2019m the oldest and married, and my younger brother (28m) had a week off of work that he asked us to help him plan something for. \n\nWe all decided to take an all inclusive week long vacation that my younger sister (30f) found a good deal for which was within all of our price range. I\u2019m sharing a room with one sibling, my brothers are sharing another room, and my younger sister (30f) is in a room by herself. All the planning and details went smoothly until I received an email last week that we were eligible to bid for an upgrade to a better room/status. The upgrade would include unlimited drinks and dining at all the restaurants (not just the ones included with our original basic room package) and access to the VIP lounges. I ended up impulsively putting in a bid for myself and, because I had done the booking for my younger brothers, put a bid in for them as well. To my surprise our bids were accepted immediately, something I wasn\u2019t expecting. I called my younger sister to tell her to place a bid for an upgrade as well and, becuase it was expensive, offered to pay for half of her upgrade. \n\nIt\u2019s been two days now and it doesn\u2019t look like her bid was accepted. We called the resort and they said the status we were upgraded to has been fully booked, her room level is now 3 grades below ours with a separate dining area, separate amenities and it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019ll be allowed in to the VIP lounges we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve tried to think of ways to sneak her in to our lounges/restaurants but she\u2019s acting like we left her behind and has become mopey and sad. She\u2019s making sarcastic comments about keeping to herself in her \u201cpoor person section\u201d and it\u2019s making everyone feel guilty. The whole trip was initially her idea and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem but her own if she didn\u2019t get the upgrade like the rest of us. I\u2019m stressed now that this will ruin our vacation together.

Your sister put all of the effort into finding the deal, and it sounds like she got her own room as the \u2018reward\u2019 instead of sharing, but then you upgraded everyone but her - so you all are going to have exclusive access to everywhere in your booking class, and she will be extra alone and excluded. If you couldn\u2019t coordinate doing the upgrades together, you should not have tried doing it for just your room and your brothers.

The level of selfishness to do something for all but one family member and then blame them for missing out is just breathtaking.", "YTA if you plan on using the \"exclusive\" restaurants and lounges and whatever other amenities outside of your individual rooms. You're basically forcing your sister to vacation alone, which isn't what she signed up for.....", "YTA\n\nThe only acceptable way to fix this mistake is either: \n\n1. Only spend the vacation in areas that *all* members of the family are allowed to visit (i.e. non-VIP areas). \n\n2.

Give her your upgraded room and see how that feels", "YTA. Why didn't you put in a bid for your sister? Are you going to eat apart from her every meal and use separate amenities?

Your sister found a great deal so you could all vacation together. But when it was time to get a free upgrade, you left her behind.

You should never have tried to get the upgrade unless you were sure everyone could also get it.  Now it\u2019s not really a family vacation is it? Hopefully you can decline the upgrade and get your original rooms back and salvage the vacation.", "Surely if you explain the situation to the resort and offer to pay, they will be able to scrounge up the VIP pass for the extra drinks or whatever.

You are going on vacation together and if there are things she's excluded from that's pretty cold. You could have bid for her as well or not bid at all if you couldn't also bid for her.

You will have family vacation without her?", "YTA- she found the hotel and you only after the fact told her to place her bid. The moment you were doing it you should have told her as well.

That could have decided the issue before you placed a bid. At this point, you are separated from your sister in dining and other amenities. If it were me I would either reject the upgrade in favor of being together or approach the hotel manager, explain the circumstances, and ask if there is any way to pay to upgrade your sister as well.\n\nToo bad damage has already been done.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Couldn\u2019t she have paid you back if/when it went through? YTA and I\u2019m not understanding your reasoning to try and finagle your way out of it.", "YTA. And because you\u2019re being so obtuse about it, monumentally so.", "Yta! As soon as you thought to place your bid or got the email, you should have sent it to you sister instead of just thinking of yourself and your brothers. I get the feeling you don't like her very much and yoh wouldn't care if she was miserable and alone on a FAMILY holiday, as long as you're having a great time right?\n\nUG, YTA", "NTA she would have received the same email but didn't act on it.", "Wow. It was her idea and then you upgrade everyone except her to the point of exclusion. If I was your mother, I\u2019d slap you across your inconsiderate mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem but her own\u201d. If that\u2019s how you treat a sibling, I\u2019d hate to be your friend.", "I mean, it doesn't really seem like she's part of your vacation together anymore. She's staying alone and isn't allowed in the restaurants you plan to eat at or areas you plan to be in. You didn't bother to tell her to put a bid in when you did and by the time you told her it was too late. YTA.", "Yes, YTA! That\u2019s so rude of you! It\u2019s suppose to be a sibling trip to spend time together, and she\u2019ll be left out of some of it. Either you all upgrade, or you don\u2019t! I would never do this to my sisters, I would feel so bad.", "NAH as long as you don\u2019t use the lounges and restaurants she can\u2019t be at", "Well if you're planning to spend time in the lounges/restaurants your sister is excluded from of course YTA. The whole trip was her idea and now you plan to avoid her.", "You have to know YTA! How would you feel in her shoes?????", "YTA other comments explain it perfectly.", "YTA you should ask if you can give up the upgrade. It isn\u2019t fair to your sister at all", "Here\u2019s an idea - if it honestly wouldn\u2019t make you feel bad if the shoe was on the other foot, let her room with your other sister and you take the single then it won\u2019t have to be a big deal! Problem solved.", "Whahahaha oh my dear u/Pristine_Spinach3070\n\nThe whole trip was her idea and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem bet her own If she didn\u2019t get the upgrade like the rest of us\u2026 \n\nYou know what \u2026 when they say money shouldn\u2019t come between people\u2026. This is not what they meant honey! You Do you ! And take 3 out of your 4 siblings with you and see how well that goes over!  \n\nYou can\u2019t be this self absorbed\u2026", "INFO: Sorry, but did you book your sister\u2019s room initially? \nAlso, we\u2019re you able to book the upgrade for your sister\u2019s room or was there a reason you couldn\u2019t put in a bid on her behalf?\nFinally, did your sister take a long time to submit a bid or did she submit the bid right away?", "YWBTA - if you don\u2019t call the hotel and say that you\u2019ll be downgrading your package unless they can find a way to upgrade her (and your willing to pay). It\u2019s a family trip.", "I wouldnt be surprised if she cut you out of her life after this. Especially how you talk about her. YTA", "YTA. You left her out. Period.", "And if the resort can\u2019t then go back to your original rooms.", "Edit: removed incorrect statement\n\nShe did all the initial work, and is now being excluded. Op and his brother should ask for refund on their upgrade.", "It's possible the sister agreed to pay for the single room to allow the siblings a lesser price for sharing.", "No one can hurt you like family and be so absolutly clueless about it.", "And then to be not quite sure if YTA or not...", "Exactly what I was thinking. Too bad the sister wasn't the one in charge of all the bookings. If I were her I would cancel all of it and just book myself a nice little getaway.", "Perfect solution!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "Exactly, sounds like OP wanted to vacation with his other 3 siblings and thinks of her as a tag along", "Unless I\u2019m misunderstanding, it seems like op paid for her and brothers booking which is why when she upgraded theirs got upgraded too. My thing is how long did she wait to tell her sister", "It does sound like the OP couldn't put a bid for her sister because she booked separately from the rest of the siblings.", "But it also sounds like she did nothing to notify the sister of the deal till after the fact. Have fun on this vacation of awkwardness , of your sister who planned it looking thru the gates at you all enjoying the vacation while excluded. I\u2019m so glad me and my bro consider each others feelings. The brutality of this story is rough.", "Right he literally just typed out me and my 3 brothers are ditching our sister on our family vacation. Now her being sad about it is ruining our fun time. And somehow still hit send to ask the world's opinion", "She could have told her sister she was putting in the bid and the sister should too.", "She told her sister after her bid was accepted. If she had told the sister at the same time she probably could have gotten in as well.", "maybe try reading next time eh?", "She bid for the whole group except one person.  YTA", "OP is female btw", "It sounds like it was too late by the time OP told her sis. They took the remaining rooms (rather than confirming there would be enough rooms for the whole group).", "Her.", "Op is a woman I believe.", "Op is female.", "The sister did all the leg work to find the place and the other 4 siblings left her in the dust \u2026.than after they all got the upgrade they said apply after the fact and she missed out\u2026.that\u2019s some fucked up shady shit, way to make sure she knows she\u2019s the after thought. You should have called her and all applied together or no one at all", "Yup!", "It seems like she waited to tell her sis until her bid was accepted.", "She put a bid in for herself and then separately for her 3 brothers and then ONLY told her sister. But I am guessing there was a huge gap between when she bid and when she told her sister.", "Could have messeged her to check her emails Stat but she didn't did she.", "Exactly, poor sister!", "If I am following the post, she couldn't bid on the sister's behalf because her sister booked separately from the other siblings.", "My mistake.  Corrected.", "Oo, I did not spot that. Shall edit", "She, OP is a she.", "Ahh okay thank you", "She could have called the one other person and bid at the same time together, so they all would have been accepted immediately."]}
