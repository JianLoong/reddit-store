{"id": 18645, "submission_id": "13wrthr", "title": "AITA for not upgrading my sister to a suite with the rest of our siblings?", "selftext": "This summer my siblings and I (32f) had the opportunity to take a vacation together, something we have not been able to do in the past due to our time and scheduling conflicts as we\u2019re all busy with work/school/family life.  There\u2019s 5 of us, I\u2019m the oldest and married, and my younger brother (28m) had a week off of work that he asked us to help him plan something for. \n\nWe all decided to take an all inclusive week long vacation that my younger sister (30f) found a good deal for which was within all of our price range. I\u2019m sharing a room with one sibling, my brothers are sharing another room, and my younger sister (30f) is in a room by herself. All the planning and details went smoothly until I received an email last week that we were eligible to bid for an upgrade to a better room/status. The upgrade would include unlimited drinks and dining at all the restaurants (not just the ones included with our original basic room package) and access to the VIP lounges. I ended up impulsively putting in a bid for myself and, because I had done the booking for my younger brothers, put a bid in for them as well. To my surprise our bids were accepted immediately, something I wasn\u2019t expecting. I called my younger sister to tell her to place a bid for an upgrade as well and, becuase it was expensive, offered to pay for half of her upgrade. \n\nIt\u2019s been two days now and it doesn\u2019t look like her bid was accepted. We called the resort and they said the status we were upgraded to has been fully booked, her room level is now 3 grades below ours with a separate dining area, separate amenities and it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019ll be allowed in to the VIP lounges we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve tried to think of ways to sneak her in to our lounges/restaurants but she\u2019s acting like we left her behind and has become mopey and sad. She\u2019s making sarcastic comments about keeping to herself in her \u201cpoor person section\u201d and it\u2019s making everyone feel guilty. The whole trip was initially her idea and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem but her own if she didn\u2019t get the upgrade like the rest of us. I\u2019m stressed now that this will ruin our vacation together.

Thanks for the tip!  Wait, why are you sad?  Don\u2019t you realize you are ruining this for us?\n\nCall the resort.  Explain the issue and pay to get your family member into your restaurants, lounges, and activities or forgo them.  It may not be included in her room, but I don\u2019t know any resort that will turn down business.", "YTA. Your sister put all of the effort into finding the deal, and it sounds like she got her own room as the \u2018reward\u2019 instead of sharing, but then you upgraded everyone but her - so you all are going to have exclusive access to everywhere in your booking class, and she will be extra alone and excluded. If you couldn\u2019t coordinate doing the upgrades together, you should not have tried doing it for just your room and your brothers. You\u2019ve turned a group trip into into a foursome with a fifth wheel.\n\nEdit to add - it is not your intent that matters here, it is the outcome.", "YTA. She\u2019s going to be stuck using the amenities that go with her level, while the rest of you live it up in the VIP areas? That\u2019s awful.", "YTA. You have already ruined the vacation, so no need to stress. You excluded the person who planned the trip from virtually everything. The level of selfishness to do something for all but one family member and then blame them for missing out is just breathtaking.", "YTA if you plan on using the \"exclusive\" restaurants and lounges and whatever other amenities outside of your individual rooms. You're basically forcing your sister to vacation alone, which isn't what she signed up for.....", "YTA\n\nThe only acceptable way to fix this mistake is either: \n\n1. Only spend the vacation in areas that *all* members of the family are allowed to visit (i.e. non-VIP areas). \n\n2. All chip in to upgrade your sister's booking to VIP status and all enjoy the VIP areas (still at a discount: 1 full-price VIP room vs. 3)", "YTA she went through all the planning of this trip and is now not even on the same floor as everyone else. Give her your upgraded room and see how that feels", "YTA. Why didn't you put in a bid for your sister? Are you going to eat apart from her every meal and use separate amenities? What is the point of a family trip if she is kept apart from most aspects of it? Your sister will not get over this and nor should she. You should all feel guilty and find out what it would take to rectify the situation.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s problem but her own if she didn\u2019t get the upgrade like the rest of us\u201d\n\nWrong. Your sister found a great deal so you could all vacation together. But when it was time to get a free upgrade, you left her behind. You\u2019re not vacation together anymore\u2014you\u2019re leaving your sister out. If I were your sister, I\u2019d bow out at this point, and plan a vacation by myself somewhere else. YTA.", "YTA.  You should never have tried to get the upgrade unless you were sure everyone could also get it.  Now it\u2019s not really a family vacation is it? Hopefully you can decline the upgrade and get your original rooms back and salvage the vacation.", "Surely if you explain the situation to the resort and offer to pay, they will be able to scrounge up the VIP pass for the extra drinks or whatever. You should figure this out for her, since you helped your siblings get a better deal. Otherwise YTA.", "YTA. I thought the purpose of this trip was for ALL of you to spend time TOGETHER. You spent the money to upgrade, but you're going to have to eat the cost and just use the amenities that are included in your sister's package. That's the only fair thing to do.", "YTA.\n\nThe fact that you think you might not be the AH, is concerning to say the least.", "I would 100% cancel on the vacation if I were her, that was shitty as hell. You are completely ditching her. Big time asshole.", "YTA.\n\nIt's hard to see how this isn't a huge diss to your sister if you care more about getting fancy drinks than spending time with her.", "YTA. You are going on vacation together and if there are things she's excluded from that's pretty cold. You could have bid for her as well or not bid at all if you couldn't also bid for her. Saying it's her own problem she doesn't have the upgrade as well makes YTA here.", "Wow. So how is it gonna work? You will have family vacation without her?", "YTA- she found the hotel and you only after the fact told her to place her bid. The moment you were doing it you should have told her as well. If I were you I'd quickly call the hotel and see if there's anything that can be done to have her be able to join you in the restaurants and activities and it not affect changing rooms. Maybe a separate charge but worth looking into", "Wtf - YTA of course you are! Your whole family is excluding her in a holiday. you made a decision without including her, and it backfired. You just want to be told it\u2019s not your fault she feels rejected. But it is your fault! Anyone would feel like crap if that happened. Not cool", "YTA", "At this moment,  unintentionally YTA. Did you have to do the booking to put in the bid? Did you ask the hotel if you could extend the bid to your sister and explain the circumstances?  \n\n In retrospect it would have been wise to immediately check with your sister and see if she too had been offered the chance to bid. That could have decided the issue before you placed a bid. At this point, you are separated from your sister in dining and other amenities. If it were me I would either reject the upgrade in favor of being together or approach the hotel manager, explain the circumstances, and ask if there is any way to pay to upgrade your sister as well.\n\nToo bad damage has already been done.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
