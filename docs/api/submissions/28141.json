If my kids aren\u2019t prepared for life and navigating consensual relationships by the time it\u2019s expected of them - which is younger here as I said, then I have failed as a parent. That\u2019s our job. To have our kids ready for life BEFORE the age it\u2019s expected of them. And no offence but so far I\u2019ve done pretty well", "That's completely my bad then. My apologies. \n\nI chose the title as the reveal of the relationship isn't what bothered him but her age and the fact that she's still at university. \n\nBut I really am sorry about all the confusion", "It\u2019s still a teenage uni student and a grown man with kids.", "The confusion isn't really important. More often than not, people that post here try to \"hide\" important details in similar ways, no worries.", "Just from my perspective as a mum I would be fine with my daughter at 19 in a relationship with a 25 year old with or without kids. The cheating bit would get up my neb more. But seventeen, nineteen or forty I\u2019d be just as miffed she\u2019d been involved with a cheating man rather than a single man.", "Oh I understand. I'll take that forward with me if i ever post again. Thank you"]}
