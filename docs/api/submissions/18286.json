As a result I\u2019m not very close with the new additions to my family, like SIL or BIL as well as nieces and nephews. \n\nI was recently promoted and would be staying in one city for at least a year while overseeing a project. My parents invited me to stay with them because my workplace is only a one hour drive away, so I did.\n\nOne of my sisters is widowed, and she and my nephew and niece have been staying at my parents. This is common in my culture to move back home after such an event. My late BIL\u2019s family often drops by to see them, and everyone gets along well, very helpful and supportive to my sister and her two children. I sometimes joined them, and I got close to my BIL\u2019s younger sister, Linda (28).\n\nLinda is fascinated by all the places I have been to. We also share a love of cooking and trying new food, so we bond over that. She is engaged to be married at the end of September and invited me to the wedding which I accepted. \n\nOne day Linda asked me if there\u2019s a \u201cspecial man\u201d in my life. When I said no, she asked what about a special lady, and just looked confused when I said no again. I told her that I\u2019m asexual and aromantic, so there most likely won\u2019t be a special anyone in my life. \n\nAt first Linda didn\u2019t believe me. She said maybe I just haven\u2019t found the right one. Everyone must have a \u201csoulmate,\u201d so to speak. I kinda shrugged and told her I\u2019m not closing myself off from opportunities but I know what I like and I won\u2019t date just because people think I should date. I\u2019m happy being single and I won\u2019t settle for any relationship if I don\u2019t truly believe it will make me happy.\n\nLinda went quiet before changing the subject. She then stopped visiting for a month. I then learned that she broke off the engagement and had taken time off work to be by herself.\n\nMy BIL\u2019s family was mad at me. They told me Linda learned about this whole asexual nonsense from me and began to doubt if she really loved or was attracted to her fianc\u00e9. She told everyone that she felt like society was pressuring her into settling down, which was not what she really want. She also thought she was expected to fall in love with someone, and now she knows that isn\u2019t necessarily true.\n\nI feel like this is a good thing. If the bride\u2019s unsure about the wedding, it\u2019s better to at least put a pause on it. Much better than a rushed wedding and then a divorce. My sister, however, said that Linda could just be getting cold feet and my words only made her more unsure. She said putting such doubts into a bride\u2019s head so close to her wedding was wildly inappropriate.

I often go from home to work in London too. If I had not have met my new husband (together nearly 14 years, married last month in Prague - the only destination wedding that has happened among people I know. ) I would be happily single by choice. \n\nYou showed her that she didn't have to live a life she didn't want, it hit her hard and she has been inspired/taken strength from you. As a new wife I would want those around me to speak truth, not let me marry someone awful because they didn't want to say something bad before the wedding. What bullshit that is. \n\nHonestly I just applaud you - living your truth has clearly helped someone else just by existing - what a beautiful thing!", "NTA\n\nIt\u2018s not like you took her to the annual asexual rally or one of the monthly meetings.   \n\n\nShe made a decision about her upcoming wedding, that\u2019s all. No one is to blame. It is simply a decision.", "NTA\n\nI hate to be the one to tell you... You do not have superpowers that can brainwash people into believing whatever you tell them and then make them act in a particular way by merely suggesting something.  \n\nYou shared your experiences, it resonated with her and that is all there is to it. You can have a clear conscious, because you were open and honest with her.\n\nI hate when people suggest that other people are so influenced by having something mentioned just once and then they will never be the same again.  It is this type of people that want to ban books, movies, or anything that does not go with their own ideologies, because just mentioning that it exists is wrong.\n\nPlease, adults can make their own choices and decide on what they do or do not want to do. Her family is infantilising her because she is making a decision they do not approve of and its just wrong.", "NTA. i actually find this story to be really sweet (besides the family wrongly blaming you for a choice linda made). she is courageous for staying true to herself and reflecting on what she wants after realizing there are many ways we can spend our lives. seems you two became close at the right time. she\u2019s lucky to have a friend like you to be a mirror for her", "NTA \n\nYou weren\u2019t \u201cputting doubts into her head.\u201d You were just explaining YOUR personal situation. It\u2019s not like you went up to her with the malicious intent of destroying her relationship. SHE was asking YOU about yourself and you told her and explained where needed. Not your fault that she started questioning everything.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re right in that it is better she put a pause now instead of going through the process of divorce later. What if she\u2019d already been married with children when you talked to her about all this? She\u2019d either start feeling like she was \u201cstuck\u201d and grow to be unhappy, or they\u2019d go through a divorce process that would hurt and impact many lives.", "NTA. You were talking about yourself. If you\u2019d said to her \u201chey, before you rush into marriage have you considered that you might be happier on your own\u201d then yeah, I could see why your family would be upset. But you didn\u2019t, you answered questions about your own feelings and life experience. How were you to know Linda would resonate with what you said?", "NTA. It\u2019s better she came to these feelings now rather than after she was married and possibly had kids.", "You are not responsible for a grown woman's actions. You cannot  put doubts in a person's head that they do not have themselves. The family is being ridiculous. NTA", "NTA if Linda could be so easily dissuaded by the conversation she had with you, she deserves the time to understand what she wants out of life. She wasn\u2019t converted to asexuality, she was enlightened to the notion that social pressure to marry may not lead her to what she wants at this time. She\u2019s on a journey, and good for her. Best of luck to you as well.", "NTA", "NTA she made her own choice for her life based on how she felt.", "NTA\n\nIf one conversation can make her doubt her desire to be married then she was already having doubts. It's not like you were some long-lost love interest who turns up and woo-ed the bride away.", "NTA and honestly that might be a good thing. You only said one thing and she doubted everything she probably wasn't happy and you technically saved two people not to be unhappy and maybe waisting time", "NTA Why would anyone think you caused this? The family is using you as a scapegoat so they don't have to admit that the bride and groom weren't ready. It saves face for the groom. You were being a friend to her, not having an affair.", "Nta if kind words from a friend made her second guess her decision then your friend needed to hear those words. Marriage is a huge commitment and she should only do it if she sees that potentially the rest of her life would be better with her partner by her side than without them in it.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t say anything about her situation specifically, you just explained your own situation. If people can\u2019t handle someone discussing their own preferences without wanting to change their own life, that\u2019s a problem for them. \n\nYou\u2019re also correct, if she\u2019s not sure she wants to get married, she shouldn\u2019t.", "NTA. She made a decision. It wasn\u2019t because of a conversation that you had. At least not entirely. If it helped her to see that she wasn\u2019t living as she wanted, great.", "NAH people should only get married when both parties are 100.00% sure. Sounds like she wasn't, that's all. You probably made both of them happier in the long run.", "NTA. You answered her questions about you. You didn't give her any advice, or try to sway her opinion. You didn't say horrible things about relationships or marriage. And even if you had done these things, it still wouldn't be your fault strictly speaking. Linda is a grown person (I sincerely hope) who is capable of making her own decisions about her life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
