The norm in most places is to lock the bathroom door when the bathroom is in use.\n\nThat being said it isn't unheard of in some families that are close to let multiple people use the bathroom at the same time. One person is on the toilet while the other person is showering. I guess there can also be groups where people don't bother to shut the door when they are in the bathroom. Personally I prefer to not look at people while they are pooping, and I like a wall between me and aerosolized excrement... but as long as it works *for everyone* I don't care.\n\nThe issue is that in your case it *doesn't* work for everyone. You are not comfortable with people popping in while you are showering, and you don't need to be comfortable.\n\nI think talking to your dad is some good advice. It sounds like you are having issues getting your mother to listen, so your dad's support would be helpful.", "NTA- privacy is a basic human need. id lock all kinds of doors if my mother peeked in my shower \ud83d\ude2d. i have a grandmother like this, and ive just taken to locking doors after she refused to knock. your mother needs to understand boundaries christ", "NTA. It's common practice to lock the bathroom when using it, your mother is a very strange person for thinking otherwise.", "Nta locking the bathroom door when in use is a very normal thing not sure why your mother is freaking about it", "NTA.  Yes, you are entitled to your privacy and she can wait a minute.", "Keep locking the door and talk to dad about this situation.

Why didn\u2019t she just start talking to him if she thought it was him? Why did she peek? She\u2019s all the more reason to lock the door. Removing the lock is abusive and creepier. She could have calmly discussed a plan like the ones suggested here instead of threatening you. \n\nIf she removes the lock, shower with a bathing suit on and scream like hell next time she peeks, and lose your temper with her to rip her a new one for invading your privacy. Make a scene. Shed light on the creep. \n\nTalk to your dad.", "NTA. You're mom is being a creep for seemingly no reason. Its inappropriate. You're uncomfortable with it.

Keep locking the door and considerately hurrying up if someone knocks and needs the facilities.", "NTA, but you might want to consider a system where you announce that you are heading to the shower, and if anybody needs to use the toilet, they should do it now. \n\nSharing a single bathroom in a house sucks. I'm from the US, but have spent several years living in Soviet apartment blocks... which certainly have their downsides, but one of the *positives* is that they almost always have the toilet in a separate water closet from the sink and tub. This means that if somebody is in the shower, the toilet is available and you can just go wash your hands in the kitchen sink. \n\nI used to live in a shared house with one bathroom and 6 people in it, none of us related. Was a nightmare at points. Half of the time the men just went out in the backyard to use a tree and... well, I had an oversized yogurt container for emergencies. Basically a new-age chamberpot. \n\nHouses with one bathroom really ought to have the toilet separated. It would solve a lot of issues.", "NTA but you could maybe compromise. I had this exact same problem all the time in our old house when we all shared a bathroom. I always showered with the door locked for my own comfort. I even felt more comfortable locking it when I was home alone. After a while though I just got really frustrated with having to get up and unlock it all the time, and then found myself on the other side a few too many times. Eventually we all agreed on a rule where we would announce that we were going to shower if anyone had to go before we got in. Then if it can\u2019t be helped, the person in the shower can get out or allow the other person in to use the toilet.  Both would respect eachothers privacy, no peeking, and always knock loudly before entering.  It may not be the perfect answer that gives the proper privacy to everyone, but that was just how we had to do it as a family of 5 without killing eachother.", "NTA. The idea of someone going to the bathroom while I\u2019m in the shower completely grosses me out. You have absolutely every right to lock the door while you\u2019re in the bathroom.

If someone was in the shower and someone else had to go,the only rule was \u2018don\u2019t flush and put the lid down.\u2019 My mom,twin sis and I basically trusted each other to not stare at anything. \n\n Not every family is like that though,and you are not being unreasonable. Unless you take over an hour,mom should have NO problem with waiting for you to unlock the door. The fact that she\u2019s pushing the issue seems like a bit of a control move on her part. NTA and you might want to see if dad will back you up on this.", "NTA. The door has a lock for a reason. Her even threatening to remove it is tantamount to child abuse, especially when only one bathroom is available.
