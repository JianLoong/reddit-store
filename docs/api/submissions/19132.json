I just learned my lesson: since it's possible for you to make a mistake and come in thinking I'm dad, the best way for me to indicate that I'm not dad is to lock the door.\"\n\nNTA. Unless you are taking an unreasonably long time to answer a knock/react once you know someone else needs the bathroom, you are behaving appropriately. Threatening to remove the lock when you are already sharing the bathroom in a respectful way means that your mom is an AH.", "NTA\n\nYour mother's behavior is unusual. The norm in most places is to lock the bathroom door when the bathroom is in use.\n\nThat being said it isn't unheard of in some families that are close to let multiple people use the bathroom at the same time. One person is on the toilet while the other person is showering. I guess there can also be groups where people don't bother to shut the door when they are in the bathroom. Personally I prefer to not look at people while they are pooping, and I like a wall between me and aerosolized excrement... but as long as it works *for everyone* I don't care.\n\nThe issue is that in your case it *doesn't* work for everyone. You are not comfortable with people popping in while you are showering, and you don't need to be comfortable.\n\nI think talking to your dad is some good advice. It sounds like you are having issues getting your mother to listen, so your dad's support would be helpful.", "NTA- privacy is a basic human need. id lock all kinds of doors if my mother peeked in my shower \ud83d\ude2d. i have a grandmother like this, and ive just taken to locking doors after she refused to knock. your mother needs to understand boundaries christ", "NTA. It's common practice to lock the bathroom when using it, your mother is a very strange person for thinking otherwise.", "Nta locking the bathroom door when in use is a very normal thing not sure why your mother is freaking about it", "NTA.  Yes, you are entitled to your privacy and she can wait a minute.", "Keep locking the door and talk to dad about this situation.  NTA", "NTA its kind of expected that people lock the door when they use the bathroom????????", "NTA\n\nYour mother sounds creepy. Why didn\u2019t she just start talking to him if she thought it was him? Why did she peek? She\u2019s all the more reason to lock the door. Removing the lock is abusive and creepier. She could have calmly discussed a plan like the ones suggested here instead of threatening you. \n\nIf she removes the lock, shower with a bathing suit on and scream like hell next time she peeks, and lose your temper with her to rip her a new one for invading your privacy. Make a scene. Shed light on the creep. \n\nTalk to your dad.", "NTA. You're mom is being a creep for seemingly no reason. Its inappropriate. You're uncomfortable with it. She needs to get over it.", "NTA. Keep locking the door and considerately hurrying up if someone knocks and needs the facilities.", "NTA, but you might want to consider a system where you announce that you are heading to the shower, and if anybody needs to use the toilet, they should do it now. \n\nSharing a single bathroom in a house sucks. I'm from the US, but have spent several years living in Soviet apartment blocks... which certainly have their downsides, but one of the *positives* is that they almost always have the toilet in a separate water closet from the sink and tub. This means that if somebody is in the shower, the toilet is available and you can just go wash your hands in the kitchen sink. \n\nI used to live in a shared house with one bathroom and 6 people in it, none of us related. Was a nightmare at points. Half of the time the men just went out in the backyard to use a tree and... well, I had an oversized yogurt container for emergencies. Basically a new-age chamberpot. \n\nHouses with one bathroom really ought to have the toilet separated. It would solve a lot of issues.", "NTA but you could maybe compromise. I had this exact same problem all the time in our old house when we all shared a bathroom. I always showered with the door locked for my own comfort. I even felt more comfortable locking it when I was home alone. After a while though I just got really frustrated with having to get up and unlock it all the time, and then found myself on the other side a few too many times. Eventually we all agreed on a rule where we would announce that we were going to shower if anyone had to go before we got in. Then if it can\u2019t be helped, the person in the shower can get out or allow the other person in to use the toilet.  Both would respect eachothers privacy, no peeking, and always knock loudly before entering.  It may not be the perfect answer that gives the proper privacy to everyone, but that was just how we had to do it as a family of 5 without killing eachother.", "NTA. The idea of someone going to the bathroom while I\u2019m in the shower completely grosses me out. You have absolutely every right to lock the door while you\u2019re in the bathroom. Privacy is a human right.", "Your mom sounds like a pervert.\n\nImagine it was the male parent doing this, and the cops would be involved.\n\nMaters do gross incesty shit too. Watch your back and keep the door locked.\n\nAt best, mum is lacking boundaries. At worse, mum is a greasy creep who got mad she cannot peek at you anymore. \n\nNTA. watch your back. if something makes you feel icky and uncomfortable (esp in this case re. privacy) then trust your gut.", "What if you\u2019re using the toilet yourself and she tries to get in, would she just sit down on top of you? Imagine being this entitled thinking you get to walk in on people in the bathroom just because you\u2019re a parent? NTA.", " You definitely didn\u2019t grow up in *my* house,lol. If someone was in the shower and someone else had to go,the only rule was \u2018don\u2019t flush and put the lid down.\u2019 My mom,twin sis and I basically trusted each other to not stare at anything. \n\n Not every family is like that though,and you are not being unreasonable. Unless you take over an hour,mom should have NO problem with waiting for you to unlock the door. The fact that she\u2019s pushing the issue seems like a bit of a control move on her part. NTA and you might want to see if dad will back you up on this.", "NTA. The door has a lock for a reason. Her even threatening to remove it is tantamount to child abuse, especially when only one bathroom is available. Mom needs to rethink her approach and you all deserve to be able to use the bathroom privately because even barging in on dad is obnoxious.", "I don't even bother my husband when the door is closed and he's in the shower unless I just can't hold it anymore\nAnd then I knock first!", "NTA... in my experience everyone locks the door when they use the bathroom.  It keeps embarrassing situations from happening.  (With the exception of a bedroom ensuite maybe)", "I know I\u2019m the outlier here but ESH. Your mom should not be peeking, that\u2019s just weird. But also, you have to makes concessions in a one bathroom house. We make the kids leave the bathroom unlocked in case someone has a bathroom emergency or (god forbid) the kid in the shower falls or otherwise hurts himself in the shower. But when one of us has to go in the bathroom during another person\u2019s shower, it gets announced like a royal wedding - KNOCK KNOCK \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to use the bathroom! Can I come in? Are you all the way in the shower? Are you ready? I\u2019m coming in now! I\u2019m keeping my eyes closed! Ok I\u2019m done! I\u2019m leaving now!

If she removes the lock, get a cheap rubber door stop at the dollar store and use that while you shower.", "I have like really long and thick hair, so I can take about two houres in the bathroom, and we have a second smaller one with a toilet, but sometimes it happens that while I'm washing my hair, someone is in the smaller bathroom and someone else is having an emergency.
