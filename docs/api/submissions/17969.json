Hope you have a good password on your laptop. You probably want to password protect the journal document, too. \n\nIt\u2019s no one\u2019s business what you write in your journal.", "NTA. And your partner's lack of concern over your clearly expressed boundary is something to think about.", "NTA \n\nAlso to add that often we feel like TA when we are putting boundaries in place and sticking to then instead of giving into what people want for a happier life (source: professional and personal experience)", "NTA. You were upfront about the purpose of your laptop use and explained that you were journaling as recommended by your therapist. You respected your partner's concern by acknowledging your initial secrecy and apologizing for it. However, it's unreasonable for your partner to insist on reading your journal entries as a way to validate your explanation.\n\nIf your partner continues to push the issue it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation about boundaries, trust, and the importance of respecting each other's privacy.", "NTA, she needs to understand what private means", "NTA. Maybe try explaining to her that this is something you can't budge on. She knows how you feel about her, and she knows that this activity is very specifically not about her, but rather something you need in order to process what you're going through. Apologize and stay firm but calm.\n\nI had a similar experience, but with a roommate rather than my partner. I ended up Googling the specific exercises I was given in therapy, showing websites explaining the exercises to her, and calmly explaining that I would not be sharing my writing, but that she should know it has nothing to do with how I feel about her.\n\nI would, however, be careful. I don't know the situation with your partner, but she might try and look at what you've been writing anyway. If it is very sensitive to you, put measures in place to ensure it doesn't happen.", "NTA. Journaling is supposed to be private and you\u2019re not obligated to share what you\u2019ve written with anyone, even if there\u2019s stuff about them. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be able to express your thoughts freely. Ask how she\u2019d feel if someone demanded to read her diary as a teen. The fact this is for therapy makes it even more personal in nature. \n\nDo keep in mind there\u2019s a good chance she will just go ahead and try to snoop though. Password protect the document. You could also switch to a paper journal and keep it in a private place, if you feel like she\u2019s mainly concerned you\u2019re using dating apps on the laptop or something. But if she\u2019s just determined to read your journal, this might not be the best idea.", "NTA. She is not the thought-police, she has no rights to know every detail that's going on in your mind just because you are writing them down. Her rights to your deeply personal details are limited to exactly the bits you are willing to share, and any greater expectations on her part are just intrusive and inappropriate. Her burning curiosity is HER personal flaw to deal with, not your responsibility to satisfy.\n\nEdit to add: Her wording of 'secretive' is a way to make it seem like you are doing something wrong. You are not. You are being 'Protective' of your deeply personal and still in-process, internal self.", "NTA-you\u2019ve explained the situation truthfully. That should be enough. Since it\u2019s not enough for her, be sure you have a good password on your machine and additional ones on the documents, and remind her that you\u2019ve given her no reason to distrust you. She is an AH for pushing it further after you explained what you\u2019re doing & told her it\u2019s private. Note, that her continuing to push on this is making YOU distrust HER. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m worried for the future of this relationship.", "Strong NTA, also your partner trying to manipulate you into showing you your private diary is pretty bad", "NTA, a normal conversation would've been:\n\n\"Sorry for being secretive, I'm keeping a diary for therapy.\"\n\n\"Oh really? Does that help?\"\n\n\"Not sure yet, it's been suggested by my therapist, so I'm trying it out.\"\n\nSo, the way she reacted can be of 2 reasons (to my opinion)\n\nEither she wants to make sure you and her are all good and she's not causing any mental issues for you. In that case she definitely approached it incorrectly.\n\nOr she wants to know whether you speak badly of her. She primarily cares about herself, her image, and will get angry at you for the things you've written about her in the diary. She'll use it as ammo.\n\nIn the first case, she may need to get better at communicating. In the second case, it's a major red flag to me, and I'd advise you to gtfo.", "NTA. You explained what you were doing and why it was private, and she tried to stomp all over your boundaries.  She sounds very controlling.", "NTA - getting hold of your thoughts is key to sorting mental illness. Better too that you then work out where those thoughts come from and eventually you\u2019ll learn to deal with the unrealistic ones. She should respect your privacy, and also that you may be venting thoughts that do not hold up in reality. Ask her to give your thoughts space, so you can deal with them. Reassure her that it\u2019s not her that\u2019s the problem here, and probably put her mind at rest that you\u2019re not hiding an affair from her.\n\nNext up, at some point you have to be able to talk to her. Perhaps not the full depth of your thoughts, but about your mental state and how she fits into your life. If you want her in your life, talking with her is vital. How she reacts will tell you if she\u2019s a keeper.\n\nGood luck, and keep talking, oh and try CBT, it helps you keep things in perspective.", "Nta. I feel like we learnt at primary that you don't read other peoples journals/diaries without their permission.", "No NTA, WTF. would she be happy with you going back and reading her diary entries she wrote as a teenager?!\n\nShe's probably concerned that you're using it as an excuse and are cheating or something though. Can you show her the documents or something with the date created and last modified so she can see you cmhave been writing in a journal?", "NTA. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your journal, you don't have to. But I would consider talking to her about your feelings. As partners, it should feel comfortable sharing how you feel and what's bothering you. Also weird that you only mentioned the journal after 2 months, why didn't you tell her this earlier?", "No NTA, WTF. would she be happy with you going back and reading her diary entries she wrote as a teenager?!\n\nShe's probably concerned that you're using it as an excuse and are cheating or something though.
