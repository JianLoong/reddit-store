That was an unnecessary, racist and weird thing to say.  I'm in the US, born, here, heritage is Italian and Middle Eastern.  I am not bilingual.  It happens.", "NTA. I would have done the same thing in your shoes. It wouldn't matter to me if it was a joke, if I find a remark to be rude, I find it to be rude and I will act accordingly. In my opinion, you did the right thing, OP.", "NTA.\n\nclearly it was not a joke, maybe it was meant in a lighthearted way (kind of like how 2 guy friends would banter each other) but that is way out of line for work/office talk unless it's from a good friend.\n\nif she/someone else brings it up again, say, well we could take it to HR and discuss the racist remark with them and see how they feel about it. my guess they shut down, backup and shut up really quickly.\n\nI'm glad you stood your ground, even if a few people in the office think you're an AH for it, at least they know your wife is off-limits.", "Nta. Good for you calling her out on the racist remark.", "NTA. I'm so tired of people who make blatant racist remarks try to backtrack with \"it's a joke\".", "NTA\n\nGood for you for your quick and clear response.  I am not sure how your coworkers wanted you to respond.   Sure, when people are clearly rude, there is an option to ignore  it and let it go.  But when someone jokes about something that stereotypes them, there is nothing wrong with calling them out on it either.   \n\nI personally equate this comment in the same realm as blond jokes or telling a women she must be upset because she is being hormonal or making jokes that your Asian coworker must be good at math.   \n\n You drew a line in the sand. now you can just go back to being professional at work.  It's okay to not like someone you work with but that tension shouldn't be out in the open.  But that doesn't mean that you don't get to shut people down when they make rude comments.", "NTA! I reacted the same way when someone made a derogatory comment about my wife's Indian (as in India) ancestry. They also claimed it was a joke.

She may be of foreign descent too, let\u2019s assume French for example, but does she speak French? Unless she\u2019s a French teacher, then no. Point made.

I doubt that person would have said that in her presence.", "NTA it's great you stood up for your wife", "NTA. You are correct - that is a racist statement. Expecting that people of Mexican descent speak Spanish, or eat Mexican food all the time at home, or whatever else, is just as racist as making other assumptions about people based on the race you perceive them to have.\n\nAlso note that none of \"white\", \"Mexican\", and \"speaks Spanish\" are mutually exclusive.", "We're criticized when assimilate and when we dont. Ive been there so many times. NTA", "YTA.  Yes, the joke was stupid and unfunny, but your reaction was a bit over the top.  What is the point of telling people that your wife's ancestors are from Mexico?  You are just inviting stupid stereotypes by doing that.   It seems irrelevant in common conversations.  In my autobiography, mentioning my ancestors from Poland would be chapter 1,654.", "INFO: Why doesn't she speak Spanish?", "YUP. Such a comment is certainly unacceptable at work. I'm sure colleague would've never made such a comment to your wife's face. Then she shouldn't have made it to you either OP. NTA", "NTA, definitely not appropriate and definitely racist for sure.", "I agree. Woman was basically saying that this person is white and has lost all of her culture, heritage, and identity. Definitely not a nice thing to say.  I'm a minority of South Asian decent and wouldn't be happy if someone said I was whitewashed.  NTA", "The coworker was asking questions about the wife. One was likely \"where's she from?\" And things like that. Stating a fact shouldn't be replied with racist responses. If the person wasn't being racist it wouldn't have been an issue.\n\nThey asked about the wife. And if she's Mexican or Hispanic or latina it's gonna come up. \n\nAssuming all people who are Hispanic or latina or Mexican etc speak Spanish is wrong as well. Op was right to put a stop to the racism and people can get over themselves. A Jokes only funny if EVERYONE is laughing. And jokes shouldn't be racist In nature either.", "Maybe she was born, you know, IN Mexico? Or maybe her parents are both Mexican?", "Why does it matter?", "I'm not arguing with any of that.  But with the facts presented, it's likely that she's an American citizen, born in the US, and 1 or more generations removed from Mexico.  Why not just consider her an American instead of trying to highlight the reasons why she might look different?  This is the type of stuff that creates division instead of unity.", "was she?", "Because my guess is she's white washed. And I don't see how it's a racist term if that is a real thing that happens. Keep in mind the question isn't \"should the coworker say this comment?\". The question is if OP is an AH for calling out a racist comment. And if they jumped to the conclusion that something not racist is racist, then that kind of makes them a slight AH.", "Or she's a 2 or even 3rd generation immigrant who didn't learn Spanish? Or she lived in a bilingual house and took to English more than Spanish? Theirs MULTIPLE reasons as to why she didn't learn/retain Spanish.  Doesn't mean she's whitewashed. Also still racist no matter as to why she doesn't know Spanish.\n\nMaybe her family put focus on her English since they live in America and they thought it was best for her to be fluent in English over Spanish.\n\nRegardless why she doesn't know the coworker was way out of line.", "My great great grandpa emigrated from Germany and I don't speak German. Am I white washed?", "How is it racist though? I would genuinely like to know how it's a racist comment, when it's a real thing that happens to real people.", "Nope. But why would it be racist if I asked if you were?", "Its erasure of who someone is. You're actively trying to erase parts of them. \n\nIt's telling someone they basically are a white person not who they actually are.\n\nYou see it in media so much. When you have Caucasian actors placed in roles that were originally not actually Caucasian. It's why people get so pissed when you see a white actor play a character that was Japanese or Taiwanese or African American in say the books but then they are white as clouds in the movie.\n\nYou are changing a person to fit your view because they don't follow what YOU think they should be.\n\nPlease research the term \"white washing\" on Google and it'll explain it so much better than I can. Because I can't explain fully what it does to people because I'm a white woman. I've never had to face this like others have because I never faced racism in my life. Sexism? Sure even ageism but I can never fully truly explain it. \n\nBut as I have come to understand it's it's the erasure of someone's identity when they originate from anything except Caucasian descent.", ">white washed\n\nA derogatory term used to describe a minority who has assimilated with western society\"\n\nThat's why it's racist.", "I can see why the ACT of white washing is bad. I don't see why asking if that's the reason someone doesn't speak a native language is racist.\n\nHow about this. What if the person had said \"they've been too assimilated by American culture\"? Would that be equally racist? Because, I feel like \"white-washed\" in the context it was used here, meant the exact same thing. Presumptuous maybe. But I still don't see how the presumption is racist.", "Honestly this feels like the same virtue-signaling that non-Native Americans did when they protested The Indians as a baseball team name. A bunch of white people deciding white-wash is a racist term because it has the word white in it. Nothing about the actual definition is racist in any way, shape, or form.", "Yeah, I guess I'm not sure if the term whitewashed is racist, but I certainly think its offensive.", "Honestly? It's called don't bring any of that up. You leave it alone. You don't use anything potentially racist to define someone. Especially at work \n\nIt's a racist term used to hurt people. Doesn't really matter context. And what the coworker should've done is think \"can this be taken the wrong way or taken as a racist comment\" and If the answer is yes. Don't say it.\n\nLikely it was taken as \"the wife has changed herself to fit in with everyone else and has erased part of who she is\" which is why OP called it out. Because not knowing Spanish doesn't mean her Not Mexican. She's still Mexican and that hasn't been erased.\n\nBest thing to do is avoid anything that has racist connections which white washing is a big one. And if at work or work function even more to avoid it. Cause now things are tense/possibly hostile.", "I mean OP made things tense and possibly hostile. The coworker made a comment. Yes maybe she should have done the mental calculus to figure all the protentional problems and ways it could be misconstrued before she said it. But she didn't do that. Instead she made the comment which, in my opinion, is fairly benign. It doesn't sound like it was filled with ill-intent or hate. Stupid or incorrect, maybe. But then (at least based on your take, which may be correct) OP jumps to the conclusion that coworker is a dirty racist who assumes his wife erased her history and is ashamed of being Mexican and wants to fit in by being American and... jeez. Oversensitive a bit? Just laugh and move on. OR, better yet, share why she doesn't speak Spanish, since apparently the coworker guessed he wrong reason. no one is going to die of hurt feelings and jumping to the racist card just alienates everyone when racism obviously wasn't the intention."]}
