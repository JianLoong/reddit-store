I worked as a bank teller last year at a large Bank you have definitely heard of. I had a teller lead that was hired when I was hired, and all of us that worked on the teller line were white women. Well, my teller lead had decided that because we were all white women it was acceptable to make racist comments. (It started off with things like telling me I\u2019m not allowed to shop at the Walmart in this part of town because it\u2019s ghetto and for the black people. And how there was a Hispanic woman in front of her at the white Walmart paying with food stamps, and how Mexicans all come to steal our resources).  I want it to be clear my coworker and I never entertained her comments or agreed in any way, we basically just ignored her and hoped she would get the hint without making it a big deal.\n\nOne day, she was talking about how she had thick and kinky hair, and I said I have the opposite issue having fine hair. She replied \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you have white girl hair, I call this my ni***r hair\u201d. In a hushed tone. I reported her to my boss, who didn\u2019t report it to HR unbeknownst to me. After that, the teller lead tried to retaliate by trying to get me in trouble, telling me I wasn\u2019t allowed to use my accent and have to change it (I\u2019m from Maine), etc. I ended that job because of her and went to Hawaii for a couple month vacation before looking for new work.\n\nWhile I\u2019m Hawaii, I was called for an exit interview. I basically said \u201cI loved the job, the company, and the branch manager. The only issue I had was with the teller lead and the racist remarks.\u201d This was the first HR heard of it.
