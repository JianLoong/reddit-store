{"id": 18639, "submission_id": "13wsq6e", "title": "AITA for exposing my future sister-in-law for bullying me in high school at a family event?", "selftext": "In high school, I used to be friends with this girl Annika. We were close until junior year, when I discovered she had been spreading false rumors about me. However, even after I stopped being friends with her, she continued to make up lies about me and made my life hell right up until we graduated. We went to different universities and I\u2019m in my mid-twenties now. \n\nMy older brother Carter went to the same university as Annika. Recently, he announced that he had gotten engaged to his girlfriend. Our family was happy for him, but we were surprised at the same time since we didn\u2019t know he was dating anyone. He said he\u2019d introduce her at an upcoming family party.\n\nThe party rolled around and guess who walked in the door with Carter? Annika. I honestly thought I was hallucinating, and I felt sick seeing her again. Carter left Annika with some relatives, then came over to me and asked to talk.\n\nWe went to another room and Carter explained he\u2019d met Annika at a party and didn\u2019t recognize her, but it was \u201clove at first sight.\u201d But after he found out her full name, he realized it was the same Annika who spread lies about me. He confronted her and she claimed to not remember me or anything she did. He let it go because he really liked her. He then pleaded with me to be nice to her since she \u201cdidn\u2019t remember\u201d what she had done and that she was a good person. I just told him I needed a moment to myself to process everything. \n\nWhen I eventually went back to the party, I decided I would ignore her. I didn\u2019t say anything rude, I just didn\u2019t talk to her or acknowledge her. She didn\u2019t talk to me or acknowledge me either. But when we sat down to eat, all hell broke loose. One of my aunts asked me how I felt about my brother getting married. I tried changing the subject, but she kept pressing, so I eventually snapped and said something like: \u201cI actually don\u2019t feel great about it considering his future wife bullied me and never apologized.\u201d Everyone turned to look at Annika. She just started crying and ran out of the room. Carter went after her, and they left early. The rest of the night was chaotic because everyone was asking me what happened (I told them). \n\nLater, Carter called me and said I was a horrible person for embarrassing Annika in front of the whole family and I was being petty over \u201chigh school drama.\u201d He demanded I apologize to her. I refused and said HE was the awful one for blindsiding me with this, and that if she never bothered to reach out and apologize for what she did while they were dating, I wasn\u2019t going to let it go now that they were engaged. He kept insisting that she didn\u2019t remember, and she can\u2019t apologize for something she doesn\u2019t remember, but I think that\u2019s bullshit. I ended up hanging up on him. \n\nThe way I see it, I was asked a direct question and I provided a direct answer. Also, I don\u2019t think I have any obligation to cover for her when she made my life hell, especially when she\u2019s obviously lying about not remembering. AITA?\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t believe I have to add this, but random people are messaging me about privacy, so I just want to say that the names in this story are fake\u2014I named Annika after a character in a movie and Carter after a character in a book.

Otherwise, he would not have blindsided you with it. They were hoping that in the moment you would be the bigger person and not bring it up. But you did nothing wrong. You were asked a question and you provided an answer. You were under no obligation to lie for the person who ruined your high school experience.  \n\nYour brother is being insensitive to you by insisting that you accept her. Let alone, apologize to her?  Bullying ruins lives. Many young men and women have committed suicide due to bullying. It is traumatic that he would ever expect you to welcome her into the family, let alone springing her on you like that in front of everyone   Next time he brings it up tell him YOU \"don't remember what happened.\"", "She remembers.  She remembers, or else she wouldn't have started crying and running out of the room.

She never reached out to apologise, even after your brother brought it up with her. He then threw you under the bus so he can get laid. He ambushed you at the party hoping that social awkwardness would make you keep quiet so he could show her off.  She and your brother are massive arseholes.

That's on him. Annika should have taken ownership of her past behavior, not hidden behind more lies. Your brother is being a deliberate AH by buying into her 'don't remember' crap- he's dodging the ugly fight that he would have with Annika by calling out her lie - this way the 'fight' is between the two of you and he just gets to stay on the sidelines.

And, oh, yes, she remembers what she did.  \n\nI don't disagree that what happened is high school drama.  Most of us mature past our younger bad behaviors and have no problem acknowledging them and feeling remorse from them.  YOU are the one due the apology.  Annika needs to face up to what happened, show remorse, and then both of you can learn how to co-exist in the same family.  On your part, you will need to let go of the hurt you felt and to forgive.

Pathetic, both of them.\n\nNot to mention they BOTH chose to blindside you with their relationship.

I was bullied from basically grade school until I graduated high school and it really never goes away. I'm 40 now and I still get emotional when I am exposed to certain things that trigger the bullying memories. Meeting your past tormenter face to face and finding out she is going to be part of your family is definitely emotional and triggering. \n\nThe reason I say ESH is probably because feel that you could have taken the 'high road' and just gritted your teeth and said some BS response like 'I'm love seeing my brother happy! Congratulations!' or something like that. If anyone asked directly what you think about Annika, you could give a 'We actually went to school together but it's been so long so we are practically strangers.' Basically a non-response but something to keep the peace. This might be an unpopular train of thought, but it's what I would have done. Sometimes it's just not the right time to cause a scene. Later, if you're up to it, you could confront Annika in whatever manner you feel is appropriate privately or maybe with your brother. Again, this is just the way I operate - but I'm pretty non-confrontational as well.\n\nAnnika is an AH for obvious reasons and your brother is as well for completely blindsiding you with this info. Though I suppose I give him SOME credit for confronting her with it early on even though him buying her excuse of 'forgetting' is kinda whack. Though I will say that as crazy as it seems, it is actually possible she legitimately forgot because she might have been the type that was such an AH that it was her normal MO to just bully people and she never gave it a second thought or could have not even registered it as bullying. So kinda like that M. Bison line in the Street Fighter movie - her bullying was a traumatic experience to you, but for her, it was just another day. Not that that excuses her, though. For her, the best course is once she learned what she did, even if she did forget, she should apologize. And if she has truly turned over a new leaf (which is also possible), she will just have to prove that to you (and your brother - it's kind of an unknown if you are close to him or if you think he is a good person).\n\nRunning away crying COULD be a sign of guilt or manipulation or it COULD be that she is flustered and she really doesn't know what you're going on about - all she knows is her fiance's  sister really hates her. Which might make someone cry. Of course, it could all just be manipulation. I'm just looking at another possibility. Devil's advocate... or maybe in this case it's Angel's advocate?", "ESH", "NTA Before the event your brother should have informed you. He know what she did to you and how much you hurt.

Poor OP has two bullies.", "I think this is the right attitude to have. You are not obligated to apologize to someone who abused you and caused you harm.

Embarrassed and remorseful, though she seems to be missing the latter half. \n\nYou could point out to your parents and brother that her saying she doesn't remember (which I don't believe anyhow) is a sign that she's never reflected on her past actions and so very likely has not changed at all. If she had done any reflection, she would have thought pretty hard about all the people she hurt and not have all those convenient memory gaps. At the very least, after being reminded of what happened, she'd have felt terrible and done something to attempt amends. Her refusing to apologise after both you and your brother made her aware, and then going on the attack by demanding you apologise (STILL without an apology for the past) really shows she hasn't changed and is still a self serving bully. \n\nWhat happens when your brother does something she doesn't like? What happens if they split up? What happens if they have children and disagree on parenting? What happens when she demands he choose her family over his for holidays or w/e? Or if she decides she no longer likes his friends/job/hobbies? Grown up bullies who haven't changed tend to go after those closest to them the most.

Your brother and his girlfriend are TOTAL ARSEHOLES!", "Nice Street Fighter movie ref.", ">Agreed, there\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t remember being the bully to OP. It was less than 10 years ago.\n\nUnless she bullied so many people that OP was just one more random target of many to her.  Bleargh.", "NTA\n\n> he found out her full name, he realized it was the same Annika who spread lies about me\n\n>He said he\u2019d introduce her at an upcoming family party.\n\nOh hell to the No.  Carter KNEW.. he freaking KNEW this world be hurtful for you and bring up your trauma..\n   He was hoping if he did in front of family you wouldn't make a scene.\n\n\n\n>He confronted her and she claimed to not remember me or anything she did.\n\n>since she \u201cdidn\u2019t remember\u201d\n\n>She just started crying and ran out of the room.\n\n\nIf she didn't remember she wouldn't of reacted..

(Of course TBIs and other injuries and illnesses can affect memory but nothing was mentioned so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not an issue)", "NTA, I don't care if it happened 20 years, 10 years, 5 years ago, last week, or 5 minutes ago. Bullying is bullying and that sh*t affects you mentally and depending on its severity, you are affected for a few years or LIFE by it. Considering what you said, it appears it's the latter. Although an apology from her won't make you feel better, it'll at least be a step forward for you. However, the gaslighting from them both about her 'not remembering' is unbelievable and there is no way she doesn't remember unless she's got some sort of TBI. \n\nYou know this situation reminds me of a movie, \"You again\" literally the exact situation.  Except Brother was a senior when it was going on and the schools hottest guy and basketball star. The bully was the head cheerleader and the girl being bullied was the school mascot and unfortunately her intitals spelled MOO. Brother went off to college following year and he didn't see his sister for a while. Next time they saw each other was when family was coming together for Brothers marriage and the gir was on the phone with the mom and confessed her disbelief that the 3 of them (mom's kids and the fiancee) that they went to school together and never met. The daughter says the school was pretty small and she didn't remember a girl by the fiancees name and that'd her brother had just sent her a picture but they the mom said \"oh that's because she went by a nickname in high-school \" and mom started having a brain fart on the nickname while the daughter pulled out her phone and loaded the picture when she realizes who the girl is and started having flashbacks of all the torment the girl put her through and said \"J.J.?\" And the mom shouts \"Yes! J.J.! Thats it!\" And the daughter freaks out (while on a plane) and ends up cuffed by the cop on the plane and sits with him until they land and she goes over with the cop her life story and he gives her advice. Once she gets to her moms house and meets the Fianc\u00e9e (JJ), JJ goes on and on about how great it is to \"FINALLY MEET YOU\" Then the daughter comments how could she not remember her? JJ sticks to her story but come to find out later in the movie, oh she did remember, she just didnt want to acknowledge it or apologize. \ud83d\ude12 THE GASLIGHTING is real! But the daughter got her revenge and her apology in the end. It was beautiful.  \n\nMaybe watch it for some pointers. But honestly, I'd choose this as my hill to die on, cuz f*** them bullies. They gave you trauma and that's not something you can just sweep under the rug", "Nta. Of course she remembers. Heck, your family remembered what she had done.\n\nYour brother is a big jerk for throwing this at you in this situation. He should have come forward way earlier to you. It was wrong and cruel to just throw you into the fire. \n\nAnd Annika is a jerk for not trying to talk to you and apologize. And for trying the whole \u2018I forgot\u2019 crap. Complete bs. \n\nThat said, you could have acted better in the situation. Blaming your aunt for \u2018pressing\u2019 you is weak sauce. You\u2019re an adult. Press back - politely. And without malice. Keep it neutral. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in. I\u2019m overwhelmed.\u201d That sort of thing. \n\nBy doing what you did you threw down a gauntlet. You embarrassed and angered your brother. Not to mention Annika. He now has to take sides. It\u2019s now war you\u2019ve ignited - even if deserved. \n\nThe party was a way to test the waters about what had happened between you and Annika. Perhaps she hoped you\u2019d overlook what she had done. Perhaps she was embarrassed by it. Whatever she and your brother thought, they were probably hoping for some sort of detente. \n\nSurviving the dinner and a private talk with your brother later could have been a next step in making the situation work - or at least bearable. You could have emphasized how cruel Annika had been. How it had affected you all these years. To stress why you weren\u2019t \u2018okay\u2019.  Plus to call out his hiding the identify of Annika and thinking it would be okay to do what he did.\n\nBut that chance is probably gone. now you\u2019ll have deal with burned bridges with your brother. Not to mention the others caught in the crossfire. \n\nI want to stress that in no way are you the jerk. Bullying and shit like that can be scarring. And to downplay it is bull shit. And to drop all this without warning was utter crap. And who knows - maybe a peace was never in the cards. \n\nThe tough part is by doing what you did you deflected the real issue - the long history of bullying. By acting as you did, the story will be about what you did to your brother and his fianc\u00e9 at the family gathering - because of your past history. The details will get lost in the smoke. It may not seem fair, but that\u2019s probably the truth.\n\nMy advice is tell your brother you are sorry for saying what to said at that moment. But you were furious. And the anger is very real. And then calmly and cooly explain your reasons. Tell him all the crap Annika did. Everything. Write it out if you have to. And say there\u2019s no way Annika could have \u2018forgotten\u2019 all that. No way in hell. And until that reckoning happens, you can\u2019t be happy for them. If Annika doesn\u2019t take responsibility, it shows she\u2019s a liar - and probably hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nAnd if he says crap about \u2018high school drama\u2019 - or \u2018forgive and forget\u2019 - just smile and say it was so much more than that. It was deliberate and vicious. To pretend it didn\u2019t happen is impossible.\n\nSee what happens from there. Maybe this can\u2019t be mended. But who knows. Good luck.", "NTA and Annika on top being a bullie is also a lier. She is probably too embarrassed to admit it. But it would had been a lot more graceful of her to admit and apologize than liying and saying she doesn't remember wth. And of course now she is playing the victim so your brother has to protect her. She is setting a horrible future for herself with this start and I hope your brother opens his eyes. Is this the woman he wants for mother of his children?!", "So, brother meets a girl, realises she's the girl who made his sister's life a misery in high school, and decides that the best thing he can possibly do is to keep the girl an absolute secret until he can blindside his sister with the girl's presence at a family event?\n\nWhat an utter, utter asshole.\n\nI mean Annika's an asshole too for what she did, and for feigning not remembering it, but dear LORD what Carter did was brutally calculated.\n\nNTA.", "I think in front of the entire family wasn't great, but they kept pressing you and you gave in under the pressure.

But you and I both know she doesn't want that. I'm not going to 'drop this' because it isn't *my* place to correct *her* mistakes. That's up to her. Pettiness goes two ways, bro, but one person was hurt in this scenario and the other was the perpetrator.\"", "NTA. Your brother is a terrible sibling.

You have the gut feeling he\u2019s choosing to ignore because YOU know about the experiences you\u2019ve went through, yet he\u2019s not batting an eyelash. She\u2019s not someone you should ever call your sister-in-law, nor mention she is family. And for your brother\u2026 that is a boy. A man would trust his family, especially when they have a true emotional bond. You\u2019ve opened yourself up to him and he\u2019s choosing some wanna-be \u2018good girl\u2019 over his own loving blood?!? I would ghost them both.

Take care of yourself girl!!!", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing and your brother is being an ass and thinking with his dick.", "NTA - I'm sure she remembers, and your brother should have talked to you.  She ran out crying because she was running from the truth and was embarrassed.\n\nIf she was such a great person then she would have owned up to what she did.

Her wording is perfect manipulation. Notice how she said she \"didn't remember\" you instead of that she didn't know you. \n\nPeople who \"don't remember\" bullying their ex friend or the ex friend in general don't run out crying when confronted by that fact.\n\nShe remembers you, she remembers what she did to you, she isn't sorry, doesn't care and is already on the road to doing it again.", "\"The ax forgets, but the tree remembers\"\n\nDepending on the person, maybe they don't remember because what was traumatizing to OP was a normal Tuesday to Annika. That said, OP NTA", "And add to that if she did feel any remorse, she wouldn't have lied about not knowing OP.  She SHOULD have been the one to tell stupid ass bro that she needed to apologize to OP before they had the party.  \n\nAnnika is STILL a bully.  As long as she acts like this, it's best to stay no contact with her, and low with your brother.  The fact that he recognized her, knows what she did and is still taking her side is extremely concerning in itself.", "NTA- Most definitely, he knew about the situation and decided to blindside you. Rather than encouraging his fianc\u00e9 to contact you and talk it out whether she \u201cremembers\u201d or not shows that both of them were being assholes. If she was a mature person she would have instead of playing the victim and running away crying she would have said at the party she understand she hurt OP in high school she was young and immature yadda yadda yadda. Instead brother and fianc\u00e9 were counting on the fact that they could force you to stay quiet which I guess is just more bullying.", "Yea no kidding. Sounds like the aunt needs a little reminder on respect too seeing as how she kept pushing op to answer. Usually when I ask someone and their response is \"they don't wanna talk about it\" I'll respond 2 different ways. If it's someone I don't know very well it's just simply \"ok\" and move on to another topic. If it's someone I consider a close friend I'll usually ask if it's bad and then if it's yes I'll follow up with \"if you wanna talk I'll listen. May or may not have advice if you ask but you can vent about it at least\". If no same as someone I don't consider a close friend just ok and change the subject.", "I buy that she doesn't remember. I, unfortunately, was a bully in high school(I did my mea culpas for my fuckery thankfully) so I have some experience with this from Annika's perspective. When you are bullying people every day, it all kinda blends together for you. And due to the fact that bullys lack empathy, you aren't really thinking about how your actions affect others. So while you are saying and doing heinous shit that your victim will remember for years, to the bully it's just Tuesday. I have had people confront me at high school reunions and I've apologized to them for actions that I had forgotten. So there's a fair chance Annika truly doesn't remember", "She wouldn\u2019t have started crying if she didn\u2019t remember.
