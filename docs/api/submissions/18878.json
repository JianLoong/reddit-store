Unless there is something showing those seats to have been reserved with signs or roped off or however they're not reserved. I came across this like in movie theaters back in the day before they had seats assigned a certain number and then you pick them from the screen like they do now. But even though you have to pick that seating on the screen as you order your tickets, when you do get to the theater people still end up sitting in the wrong seats anyhow and you have to show them your ticket to prove that you purchase those particular seats so that they have to move and if not then you have to go get somebody to come in and tell them they have to move from the management of the movie theater or some of the staff.
