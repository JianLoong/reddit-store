Each time I went to sit down, they informed me the whole row was reserved for their family that\u2019s on the way. By the time I came to the 3rd row, i was informed the same thing. I said no. I am sitting down. I came early for good seats and it\u2019s not fair one person to hold 10 or more seats. One to five seats, that may have been reasonable but a whole row was not acceptable. They got angry and said they came early to reserve the seats and the seats are reserved. They began to stand in front of me saying they wouldn\u2019t let me see.

Unless there is something showing those seats to have been reserved with signs or roped off or however they're not reserved. I came across this like in movie theaters back in the day before they had seats assigned a certain number and then you pick them from the screen like they do now. But even though you have to pick that seating on the screen as you order your tickets, when you do get to the theater people still end up sitting in the wrong seats anyhow and you have to show them your ticket to prove that you purchase those particular seats so that they have to move and if not then you have to go get somebody to come in and tell them they have to move from the management of the movie theater or some of the staff.

I feel that the family reserving seats is rude and entitled, other parents would like a clear view of their children. There can't be more than four parents to a child really, so the other generations and extended family attending could sit further back allowing actual parents to have clear view of their children. OP is NTA", "Lol so AH behavior is fine just because you do it too?? Maybe their family members shouldve gone there earlier too and rest their butts on the seats they wanted", "Pro tip.
