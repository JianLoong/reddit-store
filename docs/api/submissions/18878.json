If they had only reserved a couple of seats for close family and you sat in one of those seats, then they would have a right to complain.", "NTA, and I hope it didn\u2019t spoil the event for you. We live near a campground with people doing this over summer, they\u2019ll set their stuff up in the best two weeks out and then leave it until the holiday season starts.
