I kept my response the same, I don't want/need the hours and he's been saying for weeks how he would work those days.

Happy people don't act this way, he should get emotional help.", "You're definitely NTA. Sean has consistently stated the position that he wants to work these days. You have consistently stated you do not. He said he wanted to volunteer. He volunteered. These were conscious choices he made. You are not responsible for his choices.\n\nIf he suddenly wants to change his mind, or not work on one of those days, he needs to own that and see what he can arrange with you manager. These passive aggressive attempts to get you to take one of the days (especially knowing you don't want to) are weird and inappropriate.\n\nTell him that nothing he can say will make you want to work these days, any year. If you're both still working together next year, absent a really dramatic change in your life, you will not be volunteering to work either of those two days. He may or may not want to volunteer, depending on what's happening each year and that's fine, but he needs to cut the melodramatic, passive aggressive bullshit out. It's not your fault that he regrets volunteering now.\n\nTell him those things, then do your best to make that subject as boring as possible. Agree that it's an imposition to require volunteers to work on these two days that most people get off for holidays. Appreciate how wonderful it is that people still work retail and service jobs so you can enjoy activities with friends and family. Appreciate that he's so eager to work these days for COMPANY, because you definitely don't want to. Then change the topic. Do this every time. Sound like a broken record.", "NTA... is he trying to paint you in a bad light for future promotions/considerations, etc?\n\nIf it was me, any chance I would get, I'd be saying \"I don't know what Sean's deal is... he kept saying FOR WEEKS that he WANTED to work those days, so I left them for him... now he's being all passive aggressive and making it out like he's making a big sacrifice... If he told me he didn't want to work those days, I would have worked them/split them with him...\"\n\n:)"]}
