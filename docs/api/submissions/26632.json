The last several times I came home for a break, however, my brother (16M) was verbally aggressive and hostile to me. For context, I dealt with mental health issues in high school and often took them out on him (verbally, not physically). I recognize that my issues are no excuse and have apologized to him repeatedly, but it doesn't seem to matter; he constantly tells me how horrible of a person I am and how I ruined his life. He will also mock my personal traumas and yell at me to shut up literally any time I speak. My parents do nothing when they see this happen; apparently, they wanted us to work it out ourselves. I have been telling them for months now that \"working it out ourselves\" isn't possible and they need to intervene because I've done everything I possibly can to be kind and not provoke my brother. I have begged them to at least tell him to stop, just to prove to me that they don't think it's okay. They have refused.\n\nBefore I left for college last month, with the help of my therapist, I told my mom that I would not be coming home for the next break from school unless my brother's behavior improved. I also told them that he needs to be in therapy for these issues, because frankly, the way I treated him years ago does not warrant him thinking it ruined his life.\n\nToday, my mom called to talk about flight tickets home for fall break. I asked her if my brother was in therapy, and she refused to answer. I took this to mean that they weren't even trying to find a therapist for him and asked if they were doing anything at all regarding his behavior. Again, she refused to answer. I told her that I wouldn't be coming home, and that she was making the decision to not have me come home by refusing to address my brother's behavior. I then told her that I was embarrassed to have her as a mother and not to call or text me unless she put my brother in therapy.\n\nSo now I feel shitty about not coming home for break. I don't want to go back to that situation with my brother, but I know I'd be letting my whole family down, and I feel bad about giving an ultimatum.

I think I yelled at/insulted him and I don't think I was physical with him, but I really don't remember details.

We were both minors, and the abuse started when we were both kids, I don't remember a time when she wasn't my bully. I begged her for years to change, and she only did when she went to college.\n\nWhat bothered me most wasn't the actual abuse I suffered (though I do still have lots of CPTSD from that), but the way she tried to downplay it when we were adults. I forgave her again and again and again. And you know what? Even though she was making progress, she still didn't change. She still would mock me for the same things or act like I was being too sensitive for still being hurt over it. I would again and again and again tell her how it affected me. But she would just say she was sorry and find ways to tell me how it wasn't that bad and my anger wasn't justified.\n\nYou don't get to abuse someone for years and just say sorry like it erases what you did. You need actual change and to accept that your victims do not owe you their forgiveness. Your brother is barely absorbing how different life is now that his abuser is gone. He's gaining confidence that you destroyed. And now he's lashing out at you for the actions you did. *You* need to change, here. You need to meet him on his level even if it's unfair, because it sure as hell wasn't fair how you treated him.\n\nYour whole post is still diminishing your own actions. You think his hostility is too much. But you're only getting a taste of what he had to live with every single day of his life for years. You don't live with him.

He had no escape from you.\n\n>frankly, the way I treated him years ago does not warrant him thinking it ruined his life.\n\nYou still describe it like he just *thinks* it ruined his life. It *did* ruin his life. He has CPTSD because of YOU. You did that. Live with the consequences.\n\nI don't doubt he needs therapy. But you can't show up for two weeks out of the year and pretend everything is okay now after you ruined any possible relationship with your brother.\n\nI don't talk to my sister anymore. The last thing I remember before deciding I was never going to speak to her again was her telling me in a mocking tone, \"You think you're such a victim, don't you?\" Have some god damn empathy for the person you hurt. I was going to the maid of honor at her wedding, despite everything she put me through. Now I never want to see her again so long as I live. Not because of what she did to me when we were kids.

It's easier for the parents to do nothing now,  then admit they should have done something in the past.  \n\nThey allowed their son to be verbally abused.  They were the adults in the situation.", "The level of assholery keeps on increasing", "I mean, yeah. Why should he accept his abuser now trying to form a relationship with him after he's been able to heal while she's gone? She is his abuser. He's not going to just get over that. Just because she feels bad about it now doesn't mean the years of trauma don't exist anymore.", "Whatever alleviates her parents guilt over their own actions.\n\nThey were adults in the household and they also let what happened happen. \n\nBe easy on them to blame OP then themselves for their lack of action.", "That\u2019s his choice and his choice only.", "I agree.   But, personal attacks do not help a person to get agreement about any difference in opinion.", "\"Tantrums\" can be more than *distracting*, and, with how you spoke to your mother when you knew what you were saying, I would put money on what you said during these episodes to have the likely potential of being far worse. I say this as the sibling of someone with frequent outbursts. Sure, the \"tantrums\" were \"just\" verbal, but I still felt incredibly unsafe at times.\n\nYou don't remember it. **He does.** He was the one being made unsafe, and he. remembers. it. all. Your lack of memory about the events gives you a distance from what you did to him that he will never have. And you *probably* didn't physically abuse him? I mean, ffs. You don't know? You haven't asked?\n\nYou were stressed and having a bad time, I get it. But it doesn't unring any bells. You said you were sorry, but did you make amends? Did you take accountability? You did real harm and damage to another person, whether you were in your right mind or not.", "My older sister doesn't remember most of what she did when she was abusive to me. Her brain has deleted it. If you ask her now she would say the same things you said. She needed an outlet and threw tantrums. And I just happened to be there.\n\nI don't talk to her anymore. I've gone no contact with her. Because no matter how hard I try, she will never empathize with what I went through or take full accountability for it.\n\nShe gave me a concussion. She still doesn't remember it. And when she does it wasn't her fault, fully, because she forgot to take her meds or was under stress or any of other hundreds of excuses I've heard.\n\nThe problem is after a few years they stop being good excuses. Your trauma is also his trauma. You lived in the same house. You can't even remember if you were physical with him, do you know how much you have to not remember to not even be sure of that much? How can you dismiss it as not that bad when you can't even remember if you put your hands on him? You know how bad the verbal abuse must have been if you were so stressed out so much you can't remember it? All that stress would have been taken out on *him.*\n\nThe problem is that you still don't seem to think what your brother went through was \"that bad\". You're still viewing it through the lens of *your* trauma and *your* suffering. How can he be offended at stuff that happened to you?\n\nGuess what? Throwing tantrums is still traumatic. I can't tell you how many times I was with my sister and she, a grown ass woman, would throw a tantrum and flail on the ground or scream at our friends and family because she didn't get what she wanted. And I had to be the one responsible for her and get her out of it. It's a horrible dynamic. I essentially had to act like a parent to her because she couldn't be responsible for herself. If she abused me I had to take it and be the bigger person, no matter how many vile insults were thrown at me daily. It destroyed my sense of self worth and made me have awful relationships with people. Nothing felt as bad as going home and knowing you had to withstand it all because you have no other choice. So I made awful friendships with people and didn't stand up for myself because none of it was as bad as what I dealt with on daily basis. I just couldn't care about anything anymore and became horribly numb and suicidal.\n\nAnd when she went to college she did the same thing you did. She walked back in like nothing ever happened. Just because you got therapy and got better doesn't mean you didn't still hurt people along the way. You get to go home when he's done yelling at you. He had no escape from *you.*", "Sounds like your therapist wants you to blame the victim here. Which I am sure that is not any therapist worth their beans would do. So either you are not telling the entire truth to people, or you are misinterpreting what the therapist said", "This isn\u2019t related to your comment but I\u2019m responding to it directly in hopes that you\u2019ll see it. \n\nI\u2019m a psychologist who specializes in interpersonal trauma (the kind of trauma between you and your brother). I also have PTSD myself from the psychological (and sometimes physical) abuse that my mother inflicted on me. Here\u2019s what I know: \n\nYour parents are the main culprits here. They should\u2019ve intervened when you were abusing your brother and they should be intervening now. People here are focusing their anger at you because you did the abusing, but they\u2019re forgetting a very important fact: it was your parent\u2019s responsibility to teach you how to cope with difficult emotions. They didn\u2019t, and so you did what *many* mentally ill teenagers do: you took it out on those around you. That doesn\u2019t let you off the hook - you still chose to handle your problems in a terrible way - but your parents dropped the ball BIG TIME and they should not be considered innocent here. \n\nNow as for your brother\u2026. I\u2019m very very sorry but there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll never have a decent relationship with him again. What he\u2019s doing now is NOT okay (it\u2019s never okay to verbally abuse someone), but I want to give you a little perspective on what\u2019s happening in his brain. Trauma literally rewires the brain - you inadvertently rewired your brothers brain through verbal abuse. His brain now believes you are a threat that he needs to protect himself against. Every time he hears you speak, his brain is screaming \u201cDANGER!!\u201d That\u2019s why he tells you to shut up. He\u2019s *afraid* when you speak because his brain thinks he\u2019s about to be abused again. And he probably learned that it\u2019s safer to be angry (rather than afraid), so his fear comes out as anger. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t have the insight to recognize any of this because your parents won\u2019t get him in therapy. Oh and PTSD is a lifelong disorder. I haven\u2019t been abused by my mother in over a decade, but I still become *terrified* when someone knocks on my door because a little part of my brain thinks it\u2019s her and I\u2019m about to get abused.\n\nAll that to say - your brother may never recover from what you did. I know that\u2019s not what you want to hear because you\u2019ve worked so hard to change and you regret hurting him in the first place. But none of that can \u201cundo\u201d the harm you caused. I know you didn\u2019t mean to, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person. But you need to accept that your actions did have severe consequences (intended or not), and your brother may be afraid/angry around you for the rest of your life.\n\nAs for your original question: are you the AH for setting boundaries with your mom? Hell no. You can\u2019t force your mom or brother to behave differently, but you can choose to distance yourself from a harmful situation.\n\nThat being said, please stop minimizing your brothers hurt. You can\u2019t remember everything you said/did, but he probably does. And each time he sees/hears you, his brain gets flooded with all of those painful memories. You know how he brings up your trauma to hurt you? It\u2019s probably because just *seeing* you brings up all of his. Truth be told, it\u2019s probably best that you don\u2019t see him for a while. His brain needs some time to feel safe and secure. \n\nI\u2019m sorry OP. This is a shitty situation and I wish your parents hadn\u2019t failed you both so badly. Keep working with your therapist and never stop growing. Good luck", "THIS!! Sounds like the OP\u2019s therapist isn\u2019t either getting the true picture or is just a yes man. I\u2019m sorry, but some of the most toxic people are the ones that insist therapy is needed for others or preach about it. Just because one\u2019s going to therapy doesn\u2019t mean they are actually doing the work.", "You're right, these are the consequences of her actions, but what are they supposed to do now ? She flatly apologized (and I realize that's not enough) and suggested therapy for her brother, which would be a good thing for him in any case.\n\nAs for the parents, even if their daughter has behaved unacceptably in the past, they have a duty to intervene IMO and not let the situation become irreparable.\n\nOP may have brought it on herself, but to this day she can't even stay with her parents because the harassment is so violent. I'd never support bullying/harassment, even if we consider that the victim \"deserved\" it.\n\nI understand your point of view though, and for her brother not to have got over it yet, he must have been through a lot.", "Sure, but OP\u2019s ability to remember really didn\u2019t change between when they wrote the post & when people called them out on their abuse of their brother.", "Let's not forget that OP abused a child/young adult. Someone who did not have an understanding about mental health illness. Now she is experiencing similar treatment as an adult and is flipping off that her victim refuses to be cordial with her. All of this post reeks of \"me me me me me\".", "I agree that parents failed for not intervening at both times. However it doesn't seem that OP actually acknowledges the consequences of her prior actions. She is being pretty nonchalant about her years of abuse. She refers to it like \"she doesn't remember much\", \"it wasn't that bad\", \"it was long time ago\", \"probably did not abuse him physically\". In the post OP claims that her abuse was directed at her brother but in her comment she goes 180\u00b0 around saying that he only saw her tantrums and he has no right to bring up her past trauma.\n\nIt doesn't seem that she cares about her brother at all. It appeara that she wants him to see theraphist only for her own gain.", "Not even a young adult. Kiddo was 10-14 when she was in high school. Super damaging."]}
