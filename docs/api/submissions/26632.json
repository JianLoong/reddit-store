{"id": 26632, "submission_id": "16fl9l7", "title": "AITA for giving my mom an ultimatum?", "selftext": "I (20F) am in college out of state, but I usually come home for breaks and stay with my parents. The last several times I came home for a break, however, my brother (16M) was verbally aggressive and hostile to me. For context, I dealt with mental health issues in high school and often took them out on him (verbally, not physically). I recognize that my issues are no excuse and have apologized to him repeatedly, but it doesn't seem to matter; he constantly tells me how horrible of a person I am and how I ruined his life. He will also mock my personal traumas and yell at me to shut up literally any time I speak. My parents do nothing when they see this happen; apparently, they wanted us to work it out ourselves. I have been telling them for months now that \"working it out ourselves\" isn't possible and they need to intervene because I've done everything I possibly can to be kind and not provoke my brother. I have begged them to at least tell him to stop, just to prove to me that they don't think it's okay. They have refused.\n\nBefore I left for college last month, with the help of my therapist, I told my mom that I would not be coming home for the next break from school unless my brother's behavior improved. I also told them that he needs to be in therapy for these issues, because frankly, the way I treated him years ago does not warrant him thinking it ruined his life.\n\nToday, my mom called to talk about flight tickets home for fall break. I asked her if my brother was in therapy, and she refused to answer. I took this to mean that they weren't even trying to find a therapist for him and asked if they were doing anything at all regarding his behavior. Again, she refused to answer. I told her that I wouldn't be coming home, and that she was making the decision to not have me come home by refusing to address my brother's behavior. I then told her that I was embarrassed to have her as a mother and not to call or text me unless she put my brother in therapy.\n\nSo now I feel shitty about not coming home for break. I don't want to go back to that situation with my brother, but I know I'd be letting my whole family down, and I feel bad about giving an ultimatum.

Doesnt make present you an asshole, but also doesnt make your brother one.\n\nBut it wasnt your mothers decision, it was yours.", "YTA. In your own post you say that you verbally abused your brother and weren\u2019t in a good state when you were last at home, and that you took it out on him. \n\nNow you seem appalled that he\u2019s not happy to be around you and wants to talk to you about how you were horrible to him when he was younger and the negative effect that\u2019s had on his own mental health. \n\nYou abused him. He\u2019s not okay. Your past actions (despite apologies) had consequences. If you want to reconcile with your family, that means owning up to what your brother experienced at your hand. \n\nI wish you all luck in everyone feeling heard and loved.", "YTA You were fine until you told her you were embarrassed that she\u2019s your mother. \n\nAlso? Why are you letting yourself off the hook for the abuse you hurled at your brother? You were older, and no one was protecting him from you. He couldn\u2019t just escape your abuse by not coming home.\n\nYou think his current behavior is so bad that you need to separate yourself from it, but you think he should just get over the years of abuse you subjected him to. This makes me think your apologies to him are fairly hollow, and you do not recognize how very much damage you did to him.", "Wow, that is some pretty wild hypocrisy you\u2019ve got going in there. YTA.", "YTA\n\n>she was making the decision to not have me come home\n\nThis is why you don't give ultimatums, it's your decision not hers, own it.  You put yourself in a no-lose situation, either you emotionally blackmail someone do what you want, or it's \"their decision\" to suffer the consequences.", "ESH\n\nYou all need to grow up.", "YTA, you took all your emotions out on him, he had trauma because of you and now you expect him to kiss your a$$ over your trauma? None of your business if he is in therapy other than you should be offering to pay for what you did.  While you were away from home he finally felt safe in his own home, then you, the abuser shows up and tell him to more or less get over it.  Yes, you need to stay away from home, it is the only way your victim will feel safe in his own home.", "YTA. Your apology doesn't mean you're entitled to his forgiveness. Also, the way you speak to your mother makes me believe your verbally abusive behavior really hasn't changed much at all. He's probably still dealing with it to this day, poor guy.", "YTA.  You were good to go until you told your mother of your embarrassment by her.", "So, you were verbally abusive to him and now have the audacity to act surprised that he\u2019s hostile towards you?\n\nGrow up. You brought this on yourself. \n\nDo you know why you haven\u2019t worked it out? Because you haven\u2019t bothered to acknowledge the trauma you caused him and sincerely apologize. \n\nYTA. Massively.", "YTA, not for the ultimatum but for your hypocrisy. \n\nYou verbally abused your sibling for years but it\u2019s supposed to be fine now because you apologized?!  His behavior, while also not great, is him telling you pretty clearly that nothing is forgiven, and the effects of your actions are still ongoing.  He doesn\u2019t like having you in his home after the way you treated him, and he\u2019s making that known. \n\nYour parents are also the problem by not intervening. Did they let your past behavior go unchecked?  Therapy for him is probably a good idea, but you don\u2019t get to decide when and where he seeks help or is ok with being in your presence again.  It\u2019s weird that they\u2019re so hands off, with that level of vitriol happening in the house.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re making the right move to not go home.

It\u2019s a hard vote.\n\nYou are N T A for wanting to not come home unless your brother is in therapy. If he is being harmful toward you, you are not obligated to deal with that.\n\nHowever, you know mental health doesn\u2019t excuse things. You say what you did didn\u2019t warrant his behavior, and while that could be technically true (you didn\u2019t give enough info to say), it\u2019s relatively common that those that conflict verbal/mental/emotional trauma see a warped underplayed version of the history compared to the victim. He was younger than you and also going through hard, fragile ages for this to happen. He may need therapy yeah, but you\u2019re likely not seeing this as he actually experienced it either.", "NTA for the ultimatum.... but i am curious if your therapist has discussed with you how your past self, before therapy, did have heavy weight on the deterioration of his mental health? He may not be able to differentiate between you with and without the help you got on top of your parent's neglect and enabling his behaviors. Hes got a lot of work to do, and has no help right now getting into it.", "I'd say to not go back until he is in therapy. But I don't like hypocrisy tho", "NTA unless you go back on your ultimatum.\n\nYou set your boundaries. Now enforce them.\n\nYou've admitted to your past wrongdoing,  but that does not give your brother a pass to abuse you. Your parents' inaction enables the abuse.\n\nRemove yourself from their lives until things change. Once they see you're serious, perhaps they'll step up. If they don't, at least you're not subjecting yourself to continued abuse.", "NTA - Sounds like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place with your brother's behavior and your parents' inaction. Your ultimatum was a reasonable way to address the issue, and you deserve a safe and respectful environment. Don't feel bad for standing up for yourself.", "You have not let your family down.

Brother sounds like he needs therapy bcz his \"life is ruined.\" You are now old enough not to have to spend every break w parents. Get out & have some fun. We all say things we regret when we're teens, & you had some mental health issues then to boot. Your parents need to set some ground rules for yr brother.", "NTA. You're not the asshole in this situation. You've been dealing with verbal aggression and hostility from your brother for a long time, and it's affecting your well-being. It's reasonable for you to set boundaries and express your concerns to your parents. Asking for your brother to seek therapy is a reasonable request, given the circumstances. You've tried to address the issue with your family in a constructive way, but they have failed to take action to improve the situation. Your decision to prioritize your mental health and well-being by not coming home for break is valid and should be respected. Your ultimatum is a way of expressing the seriousness of the situation and your need for a healthier environment.", "Your parents need to intervene if they see that things aren't working out.
