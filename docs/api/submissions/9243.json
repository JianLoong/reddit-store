Like they do in the television commercials where they splash it up and all over? That is ridiculous to leave such a water mess everywhere. And the excuse of not seeing it is pretty lame. Either she stops messing up your bathroom or put a dang lock on the door. It's incredibly disrespectful for her to be doing that.", "NTA.

You feel like the ass because you \"boiled over\" and she's upset.  However, in all the time she kept making the mess, and upsetting you, did she ever stop to think if *she* was the ass?  Probably not.\n\nBe happy you have 2 full bathrooms and this IS avoidable.  Hopefully she'll stay in her own, and you won't be having the same argument in a few weeks.

Any apology she gives you only serves to shut you up.      \n\n>I feel bad for upsetting her and I know that she's sensitive to criticism and judgment  \n\nBut she doesn't feel bad that she's making you clean up after her like a servant and literally putting your well being at risk for a slip and fall.   She certainly doesn't seem all that sensitive to criticism if she won't change her behavior to avoid it.

For the life of me, I could not make myself take the ten steps to bin my cloths, even though I knew I needed to. Why can't I just take those ten steps!? Answer: Who cares why I can't do it? It's a clearly a barrier. So. How can I bin my cloths when I change now that I know about this barrier? I moved the bin. Boom, problem solved.\n\nIt sounds so obvious a fix, but I was so hung up on \"why can't I just \\_\\_\\_\" that I didn't see it.

Seriously, it's not hard.\"\n\nI agree she should be working to fix this behavior, but I don't agree that we can simply assume she's not even trying.
