We were in a group of all other male coworkers for this conversation. Everyone was laughing while he continued to talk about my feet. I was angry and upset that no one else seemed to think the way he spoke about me was a problem. I had enough and decided to report him. I was told an investigation would open up to figure out next steps, only to find out the next day that he declined the investigation and decided to resign instead.\n\nPeople at work liked him a lot. Everyone has been talking about how mad they are that he just quit with no explanation. My report was completely confidential and no one found out why he quit. Because he decided to quit before an investigation was started, no one knew he was going to be looked into for sexual harassment. I haven\u2019t told anyone at work that I know why he quit and that my report was the driving cause. I\u2019m worried people would get mad at me because he was well liked.\n\nAm I the asshole for keeping the truth from my coworkers about why he quit?", "created_utc": 1696279219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16y7q8w/aita_for_reporting_my_manager_for_sexual/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not any of their business", "NTA Every place I have worked required it's employees complete mandatory sexual harassment training during the probationary period. Your coworker knew he his comments were inappropriate. Your coworker decided to quit rather than face and investigation because he'd have trouble getting another job if he was disciplined for sexual harassment in the workplace. You spoke with him directly, he disregarded your concerns. He left you no choice. He quit because he was an idiot who knew he was in the wrong and didn't care.", "Oh Lord, that guy crossed over the perv line quite awhile ago.  Yeah he was sexually harassing you to the max.  I wouldn't lie about it if I was asked point blank, I try to be pretty honest when the topic of the conversation is sensitive.  But you might think up a way to explain it in a very diplomatic way if he was that popular.  NTAH.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s none of their business. You raised a complaint, it was upheld, he resigned. You don\u2019t have to tell them anything at all.", "NTA. You are within your rights to keep things confidential.", "Nta \n\nYou went through the process that is in place. It is your right to have that be confidential. You don\u2019t have any obligation to share what happened or what you know about him resigning. And honestly it is kinda telling for his own behaviors if he resigned instead of going through with the investigation.", "NTA - it is no one's business that you filed a sexual harassment complaint against your former manager.", "NTA. \n\nI would completely stay out of it.", "NTA\n\nHell, you're doing him a favor by keeping the truth quiet.", "NTA - your coworkers don\u2019t need to know shit.  I\u2019d just say \u201che must of finally pissed off the wrong person\u201d!", "NTA -- it's not any of their business why he chose to leave. That said, if he is really well-liked, expect that they're going to find out anyway.", "NTA, it turned out nicely, you are rid of him and your name is not dragged In the dirt. His wager (that he lost!)  was  that you wouldn't dare report him. He _knew_ a storm was coming for him,do he scurried off. There's nothing you should feel bad about!", "NTA, they would probably blame you, and you are the victim in all of this best just to let things remain un-said", "I don't think that you were the first to complain. He left too quickly. Probably given the option to quit rather than be fired.\n\nNo one needs to know your truth, unless you want to share it privately in the future with say a coworker in a similar position.\n\nNTA", "NTA,his behavior is inappropriate and knew the investigation would find that,so saved his own ass and quit so harassment womt go on his record.", "Nta \n\nYou went through the process that is in place. It is your right to have that be confidential. You don\u2019t have any obligation to share what happened or what you know about him resigning. And honestly it is kinda telling for his own behaviors if he resigned instead of going through with the investigation.", "NTA the decision to tell them or not is completely up to you. It's possible you tell them and they are upset with you (now you know who the people you dont want to be friends with are) or its possible you tell them and they are disgusted with him and are happy he is gone. You may have a feel for how this info would be accepted and have already made the correct decision.", "Nta at all.\n\nSomething similar happened at my work recently, where an assistant manager reportedly harassed one of the contract employees. He asked her if she wanted to be friends with benefits, and when she refused, he \"jokingly\" asked her if she was a lesbian or a nun. Thankfully she reported him, and after being put on a week probation where he wasn't paid, he chose to resign. Now. He didn't tell anyone on our staff what happened other than the company had it out for him, but I think he told the male employees a version of what happened, that they had to be careful with women because we are so snobby these days. Pretty much any male co-worker says that he was railroaded out of the company, but all the female co-workers have no idea exactly why he left so suddenly.", "NTA, you're, in fact, being smart. Your colleagues are clearly not less sexist and stupid than him, so - in addition to the fact that you owe them nothing - you would only make your life hard there.\nPlus, are you sure it's just about you? Because him going out the same day it's kinda smelly", "Nta and you could get in trouble if you did tell them since it\u2019s a violation of his privacy.\n\nEdit to say, the guy is a world class perv, when I refer to his privacy it\u2019s for legal reasons not ethical", "NTA\n\nHe knew what he was doing was wrong. That\u2019s why he resigned. If the investigation was opened it would potentially follow him and keep him from doing this to another young woman at his next job.", "NTA. You were right to report him and you're right for keeping it all to yourself. Its none of your coworkers business what transpired.", "Keep it to yourself.  And seriously,  do you know how rare it is for a powerful man sexually harassing a subordinate to be held in any way accountable for it?  Usually the young woman gets hounded out.  All the best.", "NTA.  Your report was confidential.  If you violate confidentiality, he could have a cause of action against you for making the allegation public.  So what that your co-workers are angry that he quit?  They should be angry that he was making those comments.", "NTA- be glad that the problem is being taken care of and go about your business. People will always talk and be interested in office gossip. If they liked him, it\u2019s probably because they A) didn\u2019t think he was being offensive or B) didn\u2019t have to deal with his BS. You did. If he quit it\u2019s because he knew he was guilty. A guilty man will ALWAYS try to play the victim (as he did with you). Resigning is his way of saving face. And probably his career. (Can\u2019t let anything official stick to his record). Let him run away with his sad little tail tucked between his legs.", "Nta \n\nYou went through the process that is in place. It is your right to have that be confidential. You don\u2019t have any obligation to share what happened or what you know about him resigning.

No interpersonal conflict here to vote on.", "NTA. Tarantino over there can go fuck himself.", "nta.  I'd go ahead with a sexual harassment lawsuit.  he tried to take the easy way out", "YTA for lying. Always tell the truth, or at least don't lie.\n\nNTA for reporting someone that was clearly doing wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would almost guarantee that there was other things on his record, and HR told him either resign of be terminated. OP, do not think twice about this. Your co-workers will forget about him in 6 months.", "NTA I can see why you'd feel bad since everyone liked him, but you are not the AH at all for not sharing the reasons with your coworkers. It's none of their business and would, as you mentioned, make your work environment pretty awful. Totally ok to not be truthful about it with your coworkers. I'm really big into not lying, even by omission, but this situation is for you to protect yourself. I would be dishonest too, as little as possible,  if I were in your place.", "NTA, you owe them nothing", "These matters shouldn't be discussed with co-workers. It was a private matter and they have no right to that information.\n\nYour manager is 49 - if you think you're his first 'victim', you're likely very mistaken. It's likely he's been complained about before, which is why he quit without argument. HR won't tell you this stuff but you can safely assume.", "You realise he chose to quit because he knew he was in the wrong! He also probably realised that if he was investigated for the comments to you\u2026 more people would likely file complaints?! He doesn\u2019t sound like a guy who would limit his harassment to one employee only. He knew he was in deep. He ran. NTA but I wouldn\u2019t discuss it. However if you did you might find more support from female coworkers than you expect.", "NTA! It's plenty safe for men, it's not safe for sexual predators. Definitely don't tell your coworkers - there's no upside for you.", "I know it is literally none of my other coworkers business. The biggest reason I\u2019m not telling them is because I don\u2019t want them treating me rudely because I\u2019m the reason their coworker/ friend quit. \n\nHowever, a huge part of me is angry that he just got off the hook and isn\u2019t facing any real repercussions for his actions. No one in his life knows or at least cares that he acts this way. He quit to save himself. He\u2019s facing nothing. Just running. And what makes me feel the most icky is that no one is calling him out for his behavior and he\u2019s not going to learn from this.", "I agree with you. Usually one complaint does not get someone fired. I commented the same.", "I\u2019m sick of men flipping the situation into them being the victim. I feel like a man could punch a woman and give her a black eye but then turn around and be like \u201clook you just made my hand hurt\u201d", "I heard from a coworker that he asked another former coworker to masterbate in front of him. I think it was brought to HR at the time but because he said it outside of work they apparently couldn\u2019t do anything about it", "I did go to HR and he resigned", "I never have explicitly lied. They are just asking questions I know the answers to and I\u2019m choosing to keep those answers to myself.", "Don't think of it that he got off the hook. Yeah,he took the coward's way out, but he lost his income and may not be able to get a job. Still a sort of punishment. Unfortunately, if he had stayed, he might have only got a slap on the wrist. Hopefully, he is receiving his just desserts.", "He\u2019ll learn. He has to find another job and now your boss has to give him a reference. At least know that he\u2019ll think twice before trying this on another young woman.\n\nGood for you for reporting this.", "So it's option n.2: better to run away from the office before something big comes up and his name is forever ruined. Sounds like a sexual harasser who is aware of his problem. And if coworkers know what happened in the past and nobody jumped to remove you from his nails than you not only owe them nothing, but are entitled to consider them enemies", "I'm sure there is other stuff also.", "Ignore this guy. You are fully nta. \n\nThese people did nothing when they heard an incident and are mad he\u2019s gone. If you say anything to them about the report they could turn the anger to you. Keep yourself safe and play the \u2018I have no idea either\u2019 card. \n\nThese kind of reports are confidential for a reason. Part of it is to protect the person filing."]}
