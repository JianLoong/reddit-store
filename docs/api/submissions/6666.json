It would be fine for guests to pay if gifts weren't expected, like an adult's birthday party.", "Yeah we\u2019re a lot more casual. It takes away a lot of the headache of planning events. My social circle would be perfectly happy to pay $25 towards a venue and would likely just factor that into how much they paid for the gift.", "I went to a shower were the invitation specified what size clothes to gift.  It seemed smart to do it like that cause people usually gift only the smaller sizes.", "Speaking from experience, it is much easier to sneak off for a quicky when the kids are distracted doing something, like watching tv.", "I mean you invite someone to a baby shower the expectation is your getting a baby related gift", "If money is a problem, buy a cake and have a potluck for the food. That way everyone contributes.", "My kids are grown but when my friends and I had babies guests contributed by bringing sandwiches and desserts to a church hall or someone\u2019s home.\nWe didn\u2019t go to a restaurant", "YWBTA\n\nIf you can't afford an expensive restaurant shower, then host a casual party at your home with tea and some dessert items.\n\nGranted the purpose of a baby shower originally was to provide basic items for new parents, I think at this point it has morphed into a general celebration for any expectant mother. While there might be stuff left over from previous babies, there are always items that are useful including diapers, onesies (which tend to get very stained and raggedy); stuffed animals or even chipping in a more expensive items that they didn't own which are relatively new on the market like one of the baby soothing machines.", "If you can\u2019t afford to host, don\u2019t host.", "NTA when we had a baby shower for my friend everybody pitched in or brought food etc. We also planned the whole thing together. I\u2019m not American though so I\u2019m not familiar with their customs", "YTA.\nHaving a baby shower for a THIRD baby is already pretty stupid. Don't make it worse by expecting people to pay for it", "YTA\n\n....But only for asking them to pay for their food. Because then they will have to get a gift as well, you know? So if you do this then could you say \"We only ask to cover the cost of food, no gifts required\" if you word it like that that would be okay.\n\nBut you are asking people to cover their own food + get a gift? Maybe not a great idea if you can't afford to put on the party. \n\nPeople contribute in America, they would be bringing presents, but they are probably not expected to pay the extra or their own food?", "Here in NC there are 3 types of baby showers. 1st baby is a baby shower. 2nd baby is a baby sprinkle. 3rd baby is a baby drizzle. Gifts get less and less with each baby. You as the host provide everything. Rude as hell to ask attendees for help. If you're financially stable to have a 3rd child, then clearly you can afford some punch and chips.", "If you are financially stable to have a 3rd child, then clearly you can provide some punch and cake at your baby shower. You are the HOST.", "Why is she have a baby shower for her THIRD baby?!?", "If you decide to throw a baby shower than you need to be able to pay for it. It would be rude to ask guests to contribute anything other than a gift for the baby.\nAlso FYI it\u2019s also considered poor taste to throw a baby shower for second and third babies, at least where I come from. \nSo yeah Kinda TA even though you probably mean well.", "YTA\n\nIf you can't afford to host it there, don't have it there.", "Some people plan and space their kids out or have a surprise baby after they\u2019ve given everything away", "I had two showers for my first.  Didn't want all the fuss with my second.  But, I did create a modest Amazon registry (with stuff I knew I would actually use) for those that really wanted to get me something.", "Host an old fashioned shower if you are moved to celebrate your friend.  Have a little get together at someone's home in the afternoon.  A couple of hours, with cake and tea and a bouquet of flowers.  It's much less expensive.  It affordable for the person hosting, and yes the host pays.  Because you don't invite people to attend a party and then give them an invoice.", "Ugh.", "Hosted at someone\u2019s house (so venue is free)", "That\u2019s a brilliant idea. We usually give like 6m or 9m because everybody else gives NB. Don\u2019t blame them, those are the tiniest so they\u2019re the de facto cutest ones to buy"]}
