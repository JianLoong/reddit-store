Anna is lucky to have parents who are in a position to help her. It would be one thing for her to decline nonjudgmentally (i.e., \"I can't afford it.\"), but Anna acts like everyone around her has an easy job situation. She even went so far as to call the rest of you lucky. That's hard to take, especially when it's not true. Of course you want to set the record straight.", "I don\u2019t understand why we have to join our friends\u2019 pity parties especially if they\u2019re unjustified? When you\u2019re in a truly bad situation, it\u2019s different and I get it but if you just want to complain but not do anything to change the situation then I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re expected to be part of it?

Funny how people who refuse to work lament that those who do work are \"lucky\" that they can afford things.", "NTA\n\nLike you said she chose to leave her job instead of trying to find one better before she quit. She put herself into that situation, so she has no right to be making the comments she does.\n\nIt's called being a adult. If you don't like something, you look for something better while still working where you don't like it. Otherwise if you just quit, then you deserve not to be able to afford finer things. Especially if you are not actively looking for a new job. \n\nEverything you said was correct, and you have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA- although I can feel the harshness in your tone. This being the first time you mentioned it, after being annoyed for awhile, you could have discussed it with her in a more civil tone. Also, why not help her start looking for a job.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here. She's throwing a pity party for herself, but you're kicking her when she's down as well.  \n\nNot sure what the overall quality of your friendship is, but if her attitude right now is stripping you of all sympathy for her, then maybe less interaction is better. It's just been 2 months and you admit her job situation was toxic, but the rest of you are basically just \"get over it or shut up.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is allowed to complain but if she keeps dragging other people's lives into her misery, you're bound to be annoyed by it. She shouldn't have to stay in a toxic work environment but she should want to find another job if she's so jealous of everyone's ability to afford certain things.", "NTA.... shes playing victim mentality", "NTA she made the choice to leave her job without seeking employment at other places. That's her issue. You are not the caretaker of her feelings. She is a adult. Now she had to deal with the consequences of her own actions.", "NTA.     She was skewing the circumstances of her job loss.   Everyone has bad times.  She needs to get up and fix the situation and move forward.", "INFO: How close are you to Anna? Does she have a history of mental health issues such as depression? Does she typically hold down jobs for long periods of time? Is it possible her boss's toxicity had extended into harassment (sexual or otherwise)?", "NTA", "Her job was toxic and we support her decision to leave. The only issue here is she won't even interview for new jobs and is making us feel bad for having a job. Her parents support her financially to pay for her basic needs but not enough for her to splurge. She can continue living a frugal lifestyle without ever working so it's not fair for her to compare herself to people who don't have this privilege of financial aid and have to work a horrible job to survive.", "We have been friends since we were in school and no she does not have any diagonesd history of mental illness. And by her boss's harassment I meant monetary harassment. Her boss never paid salary on time to any of her employees and there was no paid leave.", "People don't always openly share if there is harassment extending beyond what you've described. I would say if this a sudden change in behavior and approach to life (suddenly insecure as you've said) then I think you need to give her the benefit of the doubt and make an effort to reach out to make sure there isn't something more here. \n\nSpeaking from experience, I was in a similar situation post college and couldn't find a job that would amount to a career for 2 years after graduation. It made me bitter that my peers had found success. \n\nJudgment: NAH, but I think you could be more sensitive to her situation under the assumption that this is a significant change in Anna's behavior.", "Her boss is a woman. Not implying that she could not have been sexually harrased because she is a woman but, she has time and again stated that her only problem with the job is the pay. She would not have left if that was not an issue.", "NTA", "NTA she quit, so she doesn\u2019t get to complain about being unemployed, if she was truly in a bad situation she wouldn\u2019t have the luxury to quit because she would need to eat.", "Nta\n\nDon't entertain any further interaction with her,.
