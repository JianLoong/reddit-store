{"id": 32575, "submission_id": "18dbbhf", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for not sharing my daughter's school play video with my father after he slept through it?", "selftext": "To those who commented on my post, thank you. My father's leaving tomorrow, so I thought I'd give a small update.\n\nThese past few days, things have been awkward. Mostly because me and my husband were mad at my father, who was mad at us back.\n\nA few hours after I wrote my post, my father decided to \"prove me wrong\" about my daughter being upset. He sat next to her and tried to get her to talk about the play. He was asking her questions about it, many of which he'd know the answer to if he'd stayed awake during it.\n\nI'm guessing my daughter understood that, because it only made things worse. She refused to answer his questions, and at one point ran to me crying.\n\nI'm not sure if that was my dad's wake up call or if it was his granddaughter refusing to talk to him (she usually idolizes him). Whatever it was, he apologized to my daughter (\"grandpa was really tired, but he loves you very much\"). She said she forgave him, but was still upset. So he came to me Tuesday night to ask what he could do to fix things before he went home.\n\nI helped him brainstorm some ideas. Yesterday, my father surprised the kids with a trip to the aquarium. My daughter had been asking us to go there for a while, but with a newborn at home, we hadn't found the time yet. The kids had a lot of fun there, and my dad let them each get a plushie from the gift shop. Afterwards, we went to McDonald's and took the kids to see Santa at the mall. Overall, my kids had a great day with their grandfather, and my daughter is feeling a lot better.\n\nThat said, the aquarium, non-fancy food and old guy in a fake beard are definitely part of my father's idea of hell, so I'm sure I'll hear him complain about all the \"sacrifices\" he made for his grandkids for a while. But as long as my kids think he had fun, I'm fine with that.\n\nI do think he understands he screwed up, though. He's no longer asking us for the video, and has promised he'll never show such disregard for things my kids care about again.\n\nAs some of you suggested, I told him that he'll have to stay with my sister or one of his friends next time he visits. I think he knows the \"you're keeping me away from my grandkids\" excuse won't work on me, because he hasn't complained about that yet. If he tries to pick a fight over it once he's home, I'll hang up on him.\n\nThanks everyone!", "created_utc": 1701999178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dbbhf/update_aita_for_not_sharing_my_daughters_school/", "score": 557, "replies": ["> That said, the aquarium, non-fancy food and old guy in a fake beard are definitely part of my father's idea of hell\n\nWhat's he got against aquariums?!?", "#[Please find original post here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ap0er/aita_for_not_sharing_my_daughters_school_play/)", "I'm so glad he made the effort with your kids, and good for you and your husband for holding your ground!", "N", "He thinks they're boring. Same goes for zoos.", "Lord. I just sat through a ten minute explanation of a video game I don't care about to make my kid happy. There are worse things than being bored.", "Just tell him these are actually prisons for the most wily, duplicitous, aquatic ne'er-do-wells (that could even be caught).", "Tell him that these are now his purgatories.  And it'll be a looooong time before he earns his way clear...", "If I were you I\u2019d let him out of jail, send him the video and tell him that you appreciate that he made it up to her by taking her to do things you know he doesn\u2019t like, and leave it at that.  But if he complains about how he had to do those things tell him that was his choice so no complaints.", "As someone who watches Paw Patrol every night, I agree. I don't think my father understands that he's not the one who needs to enjoy these things.", "I get it, my dad was the same way. Some of it is generational I guess.", "It's a good start. I'm still not convinced he will be prioritising his grandkids from now on. Out of sight, out of mind - he'll forget all about his embarrassment once he's back home.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad he made an effort, but let's see what happens next visit. I think you're right not to let him stay with you anymore. If he wants to see you, the onus to make time for that needs to be on him.", "I think your dad loves you and the kids. I\u2019m sorry but that day doesn\u2019t sound like a great time for me either (age makes us all a bit unfun) so I\u2019d take the grumpy complaining as his way of saying \u201cI love you. Look at what I did to prove it\u201d. \n\nAlso enjoy the space that your sisters house will provide for his visits.", "MashaAllah", "I'm glad it got through his thick skull and glad that he put some work into making things right but I cannot fathom a grown man whining about \"sacrifices\" to make up for him being a bad grandpa. I mean, my mom can barely walk but for my birthday (a day in which we had my 5 year old niece and we planned activities around her) she walked about 8 miles in a local park we went to. She's 58, bad joints, a fake ankle, and a few extra pounds and not once did she complain about having to \"sacrifice\" anything for her grandchild to have fun. or even, you know, me, her daughter. No judgement to you OP, as you decide what is best, but this isn't someone I would want in my kids' lives if everything was a sacrifice or other imposition.", "Since the biggest reason he comes to visit is to see his own friends, do his own things, and make his own choices... then he can either stay in a hotel or with one of those buddies that he prioritizes so much. \n\nEver notice the people who scream \"BuT FaMiLy!\" so loudly are usually the people who barely want to actually have anything *to do* with their blood relatives, they only seem to give a damn about their \"chosen\" family (their friends).", "I was quite appalled to read about how poorly you treated your father for falling asleep during your child's performance. He is 68 years old and was tired.\n\nEven at a young age, I had the tendency to fall asleep when sitting still for a show. I used to joke that my dates had to take me to a good movie or concert to see that I got a good night's sleep. \n\nToday I fall asleep when watching television. It could be my favourite show. My enjoyment of the entertainment has no reflection on my ability to stay awake.", "Thank you!", "I\u2019m scared to ask what he thinks WOULD be fun for the kids. I mean, at least things like the aquarium and zoo are educational.", "What?  I freak out when my corydoras lay eggs in the tank.  Aquariums turn me into a complete idiot.  \n\nYou need to get him some edibles.  He'll never be bored at the aquarium again.  And the jellyfish will blow his mind.", "If OP does share the video than he can hear himself snoring throughout it.", "I tried watching paw patrol, but I'm surprised they talk so much. My kiddo couldn't get interested. We're still enjoying Timmy Time for now.", "That would be the BEST part.", "When he complains of all his \"sacrifices\", pointedly tell him he looks tired and ask if he needs a nap.", "What\u2019s wrong with your dad? My kid made a whole video tutorial HE MADE just to show me how to play Minecraft and Mario\u2026 and I\u2019ve watched them because that\u2019s what you do for people you love. He can definitely stay with someone else if he\u2019s just gonna be Scrooge around them..", "You\u2019re a spiteful one, yta in this situation, 68 yrs old, at least he managed to come to the show, yea, he fell asleep, but that gives you no right to berate him", "Oh I'm not convinced either. That's why he's not staying with us next time. I don't want my kids to get used to him behaving like this. My sister has a daughter, so I hope he stays with one of his friends instead of her.", "I know he loves me and the kids, but that's not what his complaining means. It means he thinks we're even now and expects me to forgive everything he's ever done in his previous visits. I'm used to it by now.", "What? Dude he was tired because he stayed out until 3am. He knew his grandkids had a play the next morning but still stayed out late. It had nothing to do with his age.", "He stayed up until 3AM (knowing we'd be leaving at 10AM), slept through his 5-year-old granddaughter\u2019s play (not a stupid TV show, an event my daughter was excited about and wanted him to watch) and then snored loud enough to disrupt her and her classmates. If anything, I think I was too nice.", "Yeah it's such a weird post. Op seems spiteful.", "Hey look daughter, grandpa doesn\u2019t care about you!", "Your kid can describe a video game in 10 minutes? Mine takes *hours*.", "He doesn't care. When my son was a baby, he tried to take us to a fancy restaurant he liked that didn't have a changing table.", "Hey now, I've become thoroughly invested in Paw Patrol since having a kid\n\nCan't wait to see what Chase and the gang are getting up to next", "He should enjoy seeing the kids SO happy and SO excited! He doesn't have to enjoy seeing the fish to have a good time.", "My friends are just prepping their house for a baby, and started painting the bannister bright colours. One of their parents said it looked untidy and you didn\u2019t have to do things like that because \u201cwhilst it\u2019s the child\u2019s house, it\u2019s your home\u201d. A completely incomprehensible divide.", "I managed to get mine into The Muppets Show (I have an old dvd), but my daughter's favorite is definitely Paw Patrol. My son is 9, so he's getting into his own shows now.", "I've seen both Paw Patrol movies at the cinema. The first one several times"]}
