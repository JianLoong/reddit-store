My father's leaving tomorrow, so I thought I'd give a small update.\n\nThese past few days, things have been awkward. Mostly because me and my husband were mad at my father, who was mad at us back.\n\nA few hours after I wrote my post, my father decided to \"prove me wrong\" about my daughter being upset. He sat next to her and tried to get her to talk about the play. He was asking her questions about it, many of which he'd know the answer to if he'd stayed awake during it.\n\nI'm guessing my daughter understood that, because it only made things worse. She refused to answer his questions, and at one point ran to me crying.\n\nI'm not sure if that was my dad's wake up call or if it was his granddaughter refusing to talk to him (she usually idolizes him). Whatever it was, he apologized to my daughter (\"grandpa was really tired, but he loves you very much\"). She said she forgave him, but was still upset. So he came to me Tuesday night to ask what he could do to fix things before he went home.\n\nI helped him brainstorm some ideas. Yesterday, my father surprised the kids with a trip to the aquarium. My daughter had been asking us to go there for a while, but with a newborn at home, we hadn't found the time yet. The kids had a lot of fun there, and my dad let them each get a plushie from the gift shop. Afterwards, we went to McDonald's and took the kids to see Santa at the mall. Overall, my kids had a great day with their grandfather, and my daughter is feeling a lot better.\n\nThat said, the aquarium, non-fancy food and old guy in a fake beard are definitely part of my father's idea of hell, so I'm sure I'll hear him complain about all the \"sacrifices\" he made for his grandkids for a while. But as long as my kids think he had fun, I'm fine with that.\n\nI do think he understands he screwed up, though. He's no longer asking us for the video, and has promised he'll never show such disregard for things my kids care about again.\n\nAs some of you suggested, I told him that he'll have to stay with my sister or one of his friends next time he visits. I think he knows the \"you're keeping me away from my grandkids\" excuse won't work on me, because he hasn't complained about that yet. If he tries to pick a fight over it once he's home, I'll hang up on him.\n\nThanks everyone!", "created_utc": 1701999178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dbbhf/update_aita_for_not_sharing_my_daughters_school/", "score": 123, "replies": ["> That said, the aquarium, non-fancy food and old guy in a fake beard are definitely part of my father's idea of hell\n\nWhat's he got against aquariums?!?", "#[Please find original post here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ap0er/aita_for_not_sharing_my_daughters_school_play/)", "I'm so glad he made the effort with your kids, and good for you and your husband for holding your ground!", "N", "He thinks they're boring.
