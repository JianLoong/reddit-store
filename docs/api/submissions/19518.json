Jane then asked me if I want to go to a pride parade with her. As, she wants to go meet more people and celebrate. She is very quiet about her sexuality and has only told me and a few other people about it.\n\nMe with my already introverted self was pretty opposed to the idea of going due to being surrounded by a big crowd of people I don\u2019t know, but another thing is that it is my grandma\u2019s 95th birthday and she is coming to visit. Now I may have only met and been with my grandma about 6 times in the past 20 years (due to us living on opposite sides of the country), but throughout that time she always managed to send birthday and holiday cards without failure. My grandma\u2019s health is declining and these are probably going to be some of her last years with us. So wanting to be able to get to be with her and know her more, I told Jane that I won\u2019t be able to go due to my grandma being in town. Jane got pissed off to say the least and asked me why I would choose an old lady over being there to support her in her time of need. I told her that my grandma is spending her time and money to come visit our family when she doesn\u2019t have the best mobility. So I will definitely spend time with her. Jane then told me that if I don\u2019t go to the parade with her, that our friendship is over.\n\nAITA?\n\nP.S: I should also mention that both of my grandpa\u2019s died from lung cancer before I was born. So this is one of my last chances of getting to know my heritage and hear old stories.", "created_utc": 1686452639, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146itnp/aita_for_choosing_to_be_with_family_than_go_to_a/", "score": 41, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have decades to hang out with T and days to see Gran", "Nta\n\nIf she's willing to cut off the friendship because you won't go to a parade, then she's not actually your friend. A REAL friend would want you to spend time with your family, and would understand your situation, or would simply understand that a parade isn't your thing.", "NTA. Go be with your grandma. Friends don't just throw away friendships like that, her anxieties over going to the parade are not your responsibility. If she doesn't understand that then that's on her. Also, her dismissive attitude towards your family is telling. \n\nAs someone from the alphabet mafia I know we have complicated relationships with our families but putting that agnst on you wanting to visit your grandma is manipulative. Nah, she doesn't pass the vibe check.", "NTA Omg Jane need to grown up. You have valid reasoning. Even if you didn\u2019t, you are not obligated to go just because. I\u2019m part of the community and if one of my friend doesn\u2019t want to come, that\u2019s fine with me.", "NTA.  You spend your time with grandma, you probably won\u2019t get another chance.  So sit with her, ask her about her life experiences and take notes.  Take pictures.   Your friend will get over it and if she doesn\u2019t, well she\u2019s not a friend.", "NTA, I hope she is embarrassed by her behavior", "I'm bi. Jane is an arsehole.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Please spend time with your grandma, take a notebook or some way to record her answers/ stories so you can cherish them forever. \n\nYour friend is very selfish and although it\u2019s important to have support while coming out, it doesn\u2019t take precedence over your family obligations. You didn\u2019t tell her you\u2019d go and change plans, you told her flat out you couldn\u2019t and that should be good enough. It wasn\u2019t a made-up or poor excuse, you simply don\u2019t have interest in the event due to your own disliking toward crowds and you want to see family.", "Btw, I would choose EVERYTHING over Jane for the next 95 years.", "Uhhhhhhh NTA. What the hell is wrong with your friend? Girl needs to take a chill pill. You should definetly be spending time with your grandma. If her health is declining, every second you can see her counts. With someone in a similar situation, though my Nana is younger at 85, I would definetly be going to see my Nana rather than Pride.\n\nThis is also coming from a bisexual trans dude. Your friends identity does not come before your time with your grandma. And she is selfish and entitled to think so. I'd drop her like a bag of bricks. If she doesn't empathize with the important of seeing 'some old lady' (seriously what the hell?) then you don't need that toxicity in your life.\n\nShe needs to find someone else to go with her if it's that important.", "NTA. Spend as much time with your grandparents as you can. Jane is being extremely selfish. If SHE wants to meet knew people the she can go herself.", "NTA\n\nEven if your grandma would not visit.\nIt is not your obligation to do something you feel uncomfortable (being an introvert)\n\nI hate crowds and always struggle with panic to just pass them when there are festivals in my city, and I have no other way to reach my home. I would never agree to willingly join any crowd. My real friends know that and would never force me.", "NTA - unless you are planning on having sex with Jane, why do you need to be in any way concerned about her sexual orientation? And won't there be plenty of people there, like her, who want to make sure everyone knows every private thing about her sex life?\n\nI think grandma deserves a parade, or at least a lovely family gathering.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents or extended family might know a fair amount, and is it not possible for a family member or caregiver to set up a way to communicate with her online?\n\nBesides that, your friend I assume is very scared and wants support. So when she lashed out like that I assume she took it as you not supporting her or not being there for her when she needs you. If that\u2019s the case I hope she can find a good support network (because it seems she may not have one if she\u2019s very private about it) and realises that your friendship shouldn\u2019t be conditioned like that. \n\nWhile it was awful of her to get angry at you like that, I don\u2019t feel inclined to call her an a-hole either because there\u2019s a good chance this anger is coming from a place of fear. I heard once that anger itself isn\u2019t an emotion; it\u2019s a reaction to their actual emotion. I hope you guys can sort this out, because we all need as many friends as we can get in this life.", "[deleted]", "Terrible take.  For starters, why would he pass on an opportunity to spend time with his grandma in person?  That\u2019s far preferable to any of the alternatives you suggested.  \n\nBut worse as to whether you justify his friend\u2019s terrible behavior toward the OP. Whatever the friend\u2019s fears, emotions or bad experiences, none of those things are the OP\u2019s fault. As such, she has no right to make him the victim of her trauma.", "That might have been a solution before Jane showed herself to be a total ass. She doesn\u2019t deserve one second of the OP\u2019s time."]}
