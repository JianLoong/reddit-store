As a result, we're both very close to each other's families. My wife has a sister who is 24. I consider her to be my little sister too, I've known her since she was in 1st grade. \n\nMy wife's sister Mary is expecting a baby and she is suffering from an illness (can't remember the name off the top of my head but just a ton of vomiting and nausea and dizziness and exhaustion). From what my wife has told me, the condition feels terrible but otherwise is manageable and won't affect the baby. \n\nMary was recently hospitalized for a few days due to dehydration/electrolyte imbalance because of this condition. My wife and I decided to wait until she got home to visit her. We went over a few days ago. \n\nScene: Mary & her husband's house. It was me, my wife, sister-in-law, her husband, my father-in-law, mother-in-law, and my wife's brother. \n\nWe're sitting around and talking. After the initial concern and talks about her health, the conversation became more light-hearted. We're watching the game and eating when my father-in-law mentions to Mary \"in a few months, this will all be past you and you'll have a baby in your arms. Have you narrowed down the names?\" \n\nMary says: \"We're trying to, but he's already rejected my top 3 boy names.\" \n\nSomething about that really rubbed me the wrong way. I was raised to respect women and appreciate the sacrifice they make to carry a baby. When my wife was pregnant, not only did her say go with baby names, but I made sure that those 9 months were the most relaxing and calm time possible. I picked up every extra shift so she could let go of her crappy job and stay home to rest when her blood pressure got a little high. I did as much as I could around the house too. And obviously the person who is carrying the baby and whose body goes through that pain got to pick the names, I wasn't gonna complain about that. She got princess treatment for all 3 pregnancies and I still believe I didn't do enough. \n\nSo him watching his wife throw up multiple times a day, suffer from nausea all day, literally be hospitalized from the pains of pregnancy and yet he can't give her the happiness of naming her baby what she wants? It set me off and I pulled him aside a few minutes later in the kitchen and let him have it. Basically saying what I said above and outlining how I didn't respect him for his actions, in the least. \n\nLong story short - my wife believes that I shouldn't have said anything and should've just vented about it in the car. My father-in-law and mother-in-law agree with me. \n\nWas I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1703723608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sg497/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sisterinlaws_husband_to_be/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Eject nose ASAP.\n\nIf dude is all \"LOL preggo lady go barf barf\" and doesn't treat it like the big deal that it is, then you still shouldn't have inserted yourself, but also I'd feel like \"screw HIM and his choices for baby names.\"\n\nSoooo...", "YTA.  Regardless of the rest of the situation,  your BIL is also a parent of this child and has a right to a say about its name.\n\nStop with this idea that the woman has all the say/rights,  because this is an era where both parents are equal. \"The mother has the say\" leads to the misogynistic \"and she does all the child rearing\".", "YTA.\n\nThe entire backstop had nothing to do with your argument at all.\n\nThis is about baby names, which is generally something decided by both parties.", "NTA\n\nbut he should have a veto if any of the names are ones he hates", "YTA. Naming a baby is a two yes, one no situation. He\u2019s vetoed her names. She has the same option for his names. Stop white knighting.", "YTA, definitely.\n\nTalk about causing drama over something you have zero right to be involved in. For someone so arrogantly smug to cause this amount of stress, that **YOU INFLICTED** on SIL's family was way over the top.", "AH isn\u2019t strong enough for your self righteous ass!!!  Contrary to your high and mighty thoughts, naming a child is for both parents and certainly NONE OF YOUR business.  You\u2019re lucky your BIL didn\u2019t toss you out of his house with some well deserved force.", "YTA. Mind your own business, this is some white knight BS.", "I have to change my answer. Not enough info. I can't say either way. Sorry.", "YTA. \n\nIt's pretty standard with most couples that picking baby names is a 2 yes 1 no proposition. You and your wife opting to not go that route was your priority.  Butting in and trying to impose your naming tactic in someone else's relationship is *always* a dick move.", "YTA.  You should mind your own business.  Now you have driven a wedge between the families.", "As a woman who had given birth to 4 children, and has an amazing husband and parenting partner...\n\nYTA.\n\nNaming is a two yes, one no situation. Naming a child is separate from the pregnancy situation. And it's nobody's business other than the actual parents.\n\nI really expected that you were going to call her husband out for not taking care of her/the house while she was sick, or being callous towards her, etc.\n\nBut you yelled at him because they don't agree on baby names?! \n\nGet out of here with your superiority complex.", "YTA. \n\nThe child (which is separate from the pregnancy) has TWO parents, equal parents. And both should have a say in the name. It's nice of you to forgo any opinion on naming your children but you are not a part of your SIL and BIL's marriage or their choices involving their child. That was definitely some \"knight in shining armor\" behavior that was unnecessary. \n\nBTW, it is not respectful to women to jump in and go off on their husband's for something like this. Most women would not appreciate what you did at all.", "YTA. Your holier-than-thou attitude is exhausting. Baby names is something both parents have veto rights on.", "YTA. Keep your nose out of other people\u2019s relationships. It sounds to me like you still perceive your SIL as a child. She isn\u2019t. She\u2019s an adult, a married adult. \n\nYou crossed the line, buddy. You owe both of them an apology.", "YTA\n\nNaming a baby is a mutual decision process. Rejecting a name isn\u2019t being an unsupportive partner. Nothing you\u2019ve said points to him being unsupportive.", "Unfortunately, YTA. Good for you for treating your wife like a queen, but there are very, very few exceptions to the \u201cbaby names are two yeses or one no\u201d policy. \n\nNow, if there\u2019s further information- such as he\u2019s INSISTING on a particular name, rather than just not liking hers, things change a bit. However, you didn\u2019t mention that, so I have to assume that isn\u2019t the case.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your baby and none of your business. Just to clarify a name should be agreed on by both parents as well.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour take is bullshit  - Parents are equal, and get equal vote.\n\n  \nBut either way, you are an AH for intruding ito their relationship. YOu are just kicking yourself out of their life with your virtue signalling.", "YTA", "NTA", "YTA - this was a huge overstep. You owe him an apology and you need to mind your business.", "YTA", "NTA", "YTA, this narrator is a judgmental, patronizing, ignorant, asshole.", "YTA names are a yes/no vote. \n\nAnd besides her top 3 baby names may have been stupid. Or touched a nerve! Or just wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nDo you actually like the names your wife picked? Do you wish they had different names?", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t your place. She said he rejected all 3 names, she didn\u2019t say he was unsupportive. You also just created problems for your SIL now too. My husband is my partner, my equal. Just because I give birth, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t value his opinion. I cherish his opinion, I want him to have a say when it comes to our children. I would be livid if you pulled my DH aside and disrespected him like that, especially in our home while we are hosting. You need to get off the high horse. This doesn\u2018t sound chivalrous, this sounds judgmental. Not all women want to be treated like a helpless flower while they are pregnant. Lastly her \u201ccondition\u201d has nothing to do with what happened, I\u2019m confused why it was even brought up. I am assuming she has hyperemesis gravidarum? It\u2019s a fancy word for EXTREME \u201cmorning sickness\u201d. It sucks, it leaves you entirely uncomfortable throughout your pregnancy and sick. I had it with my last pregnancy, and had to pumped with fluids as well. So again I\u2019m assuming this is what you are referring too and if that\u2019s the case, you are over reacting and being dramatic when it comes to her \u201ccondition\u201d. Just because you have been apart of the family longer, doesn\u2019t mean you get to act like this.", "YTA. Him not liking names that she suggested is not at all indicative of him not supporting her during the pregnancy. \n\nI am a woman who has gone through three pregnancies and deliveries. I suffered from severe morning sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum) that landed me in the hospital for treatment multiple times. Even going through all that, never would I expect my husband to not voice an opinion over our child's name. \n\nYour sister in laws husband is not required to like a name just because she does. She is not required to like a name just because he does. The name should be one that is liked by both of them, since the child is both of theirs. Naming a child is a two Yes and 1 No situation.", "YTA, yes the Mom puts in all the work regarding making the baby but the Dad should have a say in naming too. It\u2019s going to be a joint effort to raise the kid. It\u2019s a nice sentiment to have for yourself but to push that on others is out of line.", "YTA\u2026none of your business how they decide the name. Nice of you though to do all you did while your wife was pregnant.", "Man I thought he was going to be complaining at her because the house wasn't clean enough or something, but this is so small.  Having a conversation about what you are going to name your child is not a bad thing.  He should be giving suggestions too, that she can reject.  A person cam reject a name for so many valid reasons, I wanted to name our middle child Elisabeth, DH had a second cousin (small community) named Elisabeth and she was very squirrelly so we came up with something we both liked.  Though in retrospect both daughters have very similar names, same origin, so should have tried harder.", "YTA-If he\u2019d been asking her to do something unreasonable or not pulling his own weight then yelling at him might have been acceptable or even necessary. Baby names are not solely the mother\u2019s prerogative. They are two yeses one no. It\u2019s his baby too. He gets just as much say in a name.", "YTA... Babys are named by both parents. This wasnt your buisness", "YTA as is your MIL and FIL. All 3 of you need to mind your business and realize that the baby\u2019s name is agreed on by both parents, not just the one. Yes, pregnancy takes a toll on our bodies but that doesn\u2019t mean dad doesn\u2019t get a say. It\u2019s a two yes/one no say for couples expecting.", "NTA.

While I appreciate your consideration of what the mother goes through, the baby's name will be with that child basically forever.

What a leap of logic!\n\nAlso I've been pregnant and yes if she was having issues she needs his support (I assume he was with her at the hospital as much as possible, yes?). But other than that she's not a leaf that will blow away in the wind and just because *you* wanted to treat your spouse that way doesn't mean every spouse wants that. I was helping a cousin move a couch 3 days before I gave birth so I wasn't sitting around waiting for anyone to wait on me hand and foot.", "YTA.

Or maybe BIL has a job (teacher or similar) where lots of names have been ruined for him.\n\nHave I mentioned they have months to decide?\n\nSoft YTA.", "YTA the name choice has nothing to do with any of what you mentioned. Both people need to agree on the name. I'm glad you're grateful to your wife but bare in mind that this was a choice that your SIL and her husband made together (notice that that did not include you). Your SIL knew that this could be potentially very difficult. That doesn't mean she is owed the right to choose the name. And clearly she does not agree with you as she is respecting his rejections. It's a two yes, one no type of situation and I'm sure she has rejected some of his choices as well. You should probably just mind your own business anyways.", "YTA\n\nWhile I do agree that the non-pregnant partner should try to take on more responsibilities to care for their pregnant partner, I don't think women should get 100% control of the name. For one, that's not actually helping make the pregnancy easier in any way. It's a nice gesture, but I don't really need it. Second, it's his kid too. He also has to live with their name. \n\nRegardless, this was not worth starting a fight over. Even if I agreed that the pregnant partner should get naming privileges, it's still such a small thing that it's not worth a fight. All you did was add more stress to an already stressful environment.", "From the title, I assumed he wasn't helping her or supporting her during the pregnancy. Perhaps that is happening?\n\nBut from your post, you yelled at him because he wanted input on naming their child together. You are 100% TA.

There's nothing wrong with both parents having equal say in baby names.\n\nThis was literally none of your business, you lectured someone for something that wasn't even bad of him.\n\nYTA, you owe him an apology.", "YTA if your only issue with her husband is that he wants a say in what his child is named then you are completely out of line. Not everyone can afford to be a one income household especially not if your sister in law has been hospitalized and they have those expenses to deal with as well. It\u2019s lovely that you wanted to pamper your wife and I\u2019m glad she appreciated that and it worked for you, however some women dislike being treated like an invalid during their pregnancies and what you are discussing may have annoyed a different woman. If your sister in law isn\u2019t complaining about a lack of help from her husband than you have no reason to be upset. Going after your brother in law because he wants to have a say in his child\u2019s name is ridiculous, yes pregnancy is taxing but this is both of their child so they both get a say. A child has to live with that name most if not all of their life and having a partner to bounce off of can ensure your child doesn\u2019t wind up with something ridiculous.", "YTA.

What would be your clarifying question?", "Thats not the conflict - its his SIL who is pregnant and he went off on the SIL\u2019s husband because the SIL said he vetoed a few names.", "Yep, he fought the wrong battle...assuming there is actually behaviour that needs addressing. Needing to rest more and therefore do less is a carrying the child thing, so fight that battle for sure (if needed)....I'm carrying the child isn't a naming reason (unless it's a non serious relationship to begin with I guess).", "I love your whole comment and the last sentence is really the cherry on top.", "Yes! This guy sounds like a piece of work.", "I am willing to bet money that MIL and FIL DON\u2019T agree with him, they\u2019ve just known him long enough to know that smiling and nodding is a much better option than to disagree and then have to listen to him go on and on about it for 4 hours.", "Was this consideration though? Becauae he was so considerate that he started an argument over it? Is that helping his SIL now?", "That's not what I meant. I was saying to compromise. Maybe like we did, or something that works for them.", "That is also true. I have changed my answer as there is not enough info to say one way or the other. I took it for face value and spoke too soon.", "Why did he feel so mad that the BIL shot down the names, also how does SIL feel about the names being shot down.", "I know. I made the comment that the BIL should compromise. Was I not clear on that? I thought that I was. If I wasn't I am sorry.", "Consideration *of what the mother goes through.* You know: sickness, labour, all that. I wasn't saying he was being considerate at the moment of the argument.", "My problem is he gives no indication that they aren\u2019t trying to compromise. \n\nHe took a simple answer that SIL said and ran with it to cause a problem. All she said was that 3 names were vetoed. Maybe the names were ridiculous. Maybe they reminded BIL of bad things and he didn\u2019t want his child to have someone bad related to the name. \n\nWe don\u2019t know because OP overreacted to the one statement from SIL without hearing the full story", "I dont think OP deserves credit for that when he behaved like such an AH.", "No, that is true as well. Need more info on this one. Now I feel like a fool.", "OP gives no indication that naming the baby has caused any stress.
