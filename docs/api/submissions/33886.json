As a result, we're both very close to each other's families. My wife has a sister who is 24. I consider her to be my little sister too, I've known her since she was in 1st grade. \n\nMy wife's sister Mary is expecting a baby and she is suffering from an illness (can't remember the name off the top of my head but just a ton of vomiting and nausea and dizziness and exhaustion). From what my wife has told me, the condition feels terrible but otherwise is manageable and won't affect the baby. \n\nMary was recently hospitalized for a few days due to dehydration/electrolyte imbalance because of this condition. My wife and I decided to wait until she got home to visit her. We went over a few days ago. \n\nScene: Mary & her husband's house. It was me, my wife, sister-in-law, her husband, my father-in-law, mother-in-law, and my wife's brother. \n\nWe're sitting around and talking. After the initial concern and talks about her health, the conversation became more light-hearted. We're watching the game and eating when my father-in-law mentions to Mary \"in a few months, this will all be past you and you'll have a baby in your arms. Have you narrowed down the names?\" \n\nMary says: \"We're trying to, but he's already rejected my top 3 boy names.\" \n\nSomething about that really rubbed me the wrong way. I was raised to respect women and appreciate the sacrifice they make to carry a baby. When my wife was pregnant, not only did her say go with baby names, but I made sure that those 9 months were the most relaxing and calm time possible. I picked up every extra shift so she could let go of her crappy job and stay home to rest when her blood pressure got a little high. I did as much as I could around the house too. And obviously the person who is carrying the baby and whose body goes through that pain got to pick the names, I wasn't gonna complain about that. She got princess treatment for all 3 pregnancies and I still believe I didn't do enough. \n\nSo him watching his wife throw up multiple times a day, suffer from nausea all day, literally be hospitalized from the pains of pregnancy and yet he can't give her the happiness of naming her baby what she wants? It set me off and I pulled him aside a few minutes later in the kitchen and let him have it. Basically saying what I said above and outlining how I didn't respect him for his actions, in the least. \n\nLong story short - my wife believes that I shouldn't have said anything and should've just vented about it in the car.

For someone so arrogantly smug to cause this amount of stress, that **YOU INFLICTED** on SIL's family was way over the top.", "AH isn\u2019t strong enough for your self righteous ass!!!  Contrary to your high and mighty thoughts, naming a child is for both parents and certainly NONE OF YOUR business.

Not enough info. I can't say either way. Sorry.", "YTA. \n\nIt's pretty standard with most couples that picking baby names is a 2 yes 1 no proposition. You and your wife opting to not go that route was your priority.  Butting in and trying to impose your naming tactic in someone else's relationship is *always* a dick move.", "YTA.  You should mind your own business.  Now you have driven a wedge between the families.", "As a woman who had given birth to 4 children, and has an amazing husband and parenting partner...\n\nYTA.\n\nNaming is a two yes, one no situation.

And both should have a say in the name. It's nice of you to forgo any opinion on naming your children but you are not a part of your SIL and BIL's marriage or their choices involving their child. That was definitely some \"knight in shining armor\" behavior that was unnecessary. \n\nBTW, it is not respectful to women to jump in and go off on their husband's for something like this.

I would be livid if you pulled my DH aside and disrespected him like that, especially in our home while we are hosting. You need to get off the high horse. This doesn\u2018t sound chivalrous, this sounds judgmental. Not all women want to be treated like a helpless flower while they are pregnant. Lastly her \u201ccondition\u201d has nothing to do with what happened, I\u2019m confused why it was even brought up. I am assuming she has hyperemesis gravidarum? It\u2019s a fancy word for EXTREME \u201cmorning sickness\u201d. It sucks, it leaves you entirely uncomfortable throughout your pregnancy and sick. I had it with my last pregnancy, and had to pumped with fluids as well. So again I\u2019m assuming this is what you are referring too and if that\u2019s the case, you are over reacting and being dramatic when it comes to her \u201ccondition\u201d.

Him not liking names that she suggested is not at all indicative of him not supporting her during the pregnancy. \n\nI am a woman who has gone through three pregnancies and deliveries.

Even going through all that, never would I expect my husband to not voice an opinion over our child's name. \n\nYour sister in laws husband is not required to like a name just because she does. She is not required to like a name just because he does. The name should be one that is liked by both of them, since the child is both of theirs. Naming a child is a two Yes and 1 No situation.", "YTA, yes the Mom puts in all the work regarding making the baby but the Dad should have a say in naming too.

Nice of you though to do all you did while your wife was pregnant.", "Man I thought he was going to be complaining at her because the house wasn't clean enough or something, but this is so small.  Having a conversation about what you are going to name your child is not a bad thing.  He should be giving suggestions too, that she can reject.  A person cam reject a name for so many valid reasons, I wanted to name our middle child Elisabeth, DH had a second cousin (small community) named Elisabeth and she was very squirrelly so we came up with something we both liked.  Though in retrospect both daughters have very similar names, same origin, so should have tried harder.", "YTA-If he\u2019d been asking her to do something unreasonable or not pulling his own weight then yelling at him might have been acceptable or even necessary.

But other than that she's not a leaf that will blow away in the wind and just because *you* wanted to treat your spouse that way doesn't mean every spouse wants that.

Both people need to agree on the name. I'm glad you're grateful to your wife but bare in mind that this was a choice that your SIL and her husband made together (notice that that did not include you). Your SIL knew that this could be potentially very difficult. That doesn't mean she is owed the right to choose the name. And clearly she does not agree with you as she is respecting his rejections.

For one, that's not actually helping make the pregnancy easier in any way. It's a nice gesture, but I don't really need it. Second, it's his kid too. He also has to live with their name. \n\nRegardless, this was not worth starting a fight over.

If your sister in law isn\u2019t complaining about a lack of help from her husband than you have no reason to be upset. Going after your brother in law because he wants to have a say in his child\u2019s name is ridiculous, yes pregnancy is taxing but this is both of their child so they both get a say.

Baby names are something parents should agree on.", "YTA.\n\nWhat works for you and your wife re naming children isn\u2019t universal and most couples like to agree jointly on their child\u2019s name. And nothing in your post suggests he\u2019s not taking care of his wife. Being hospitalized isn't an indication that he\u2019s somehow failing to care for her.\n\nDamaging their relationship by \u201cletting the husband have it\u201d is not \u201chelping \u201c the woman you treat like your little sister. Know your place and stay in it.", "I don't care what anyone here says, you are the hero, not the asshole. Love you dude", "Naming a child is solely both of the parents business.\n\nIt's a two yes one no type situation.\n\n\nIf one partner doesn't like one name , then the other parent has to respect that.\n\nAnd they both reach to an agreement on the name.", "For real, this isn't even something worth bringing up. It's like OP is in some invisible competition with men about who can be the most empathetic, caring husband...it comes of as so insincere to me. Like those creepy, fake happy family vloggers. \n\nOP, I'm currently in my first trimester and I'm throwing up everyday and can barely shower without getting exhausted. My partner is doing everything he can to make me happy and comfortable. He's never once made me feel like a burden even though he has done so much for me and I'm being a big baby right now lol. I honestly believe he would let me name the baby whatever I wanted (within reason) but I want him to love the name of our baby too. We both helped create this baby and we are this together - he doesn't lose his right for an input just because I'm the one currently vomiting everyday.", "Right? I was waiting for him to say that the husband was busy working and ignoring his wife or something. But really, the names? Common now. YTA", "It doesn't sound like he thought naming his own children was his business, but here he is butting into other people's business. Ridiculous.", "He answers that question in the post. He is mad about it because he feels SIL should have the right to name the baby whatever she wants, simply because she is a pregnant woman, and he believes BIL should have no say at all."]}
