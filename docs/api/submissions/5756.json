You are going to have these conditions your whole life long and believe me, it's not going to get easier as you get older. You are never going to need less help and may in fact need more. You need a partner who understands this. The two of you are supposed to be a team, facing the trials and challenges that life brings together. If he is willfully not pulling his weight, I think you need to consider the possibility that he might not be the right guy for you.", "I would keep the dog and ban him lol.", "It's crazy to me that he doesn't understand bone aches or how bad they can hurt. There's no way him or his friends didn't experience growing pains during a growth spurt. It's a near universal experience.", "I am both hypothyroid and chronically ill. She should get out now. I made the mistake of marrying a man like this. It made my life infinitely harder. I am now happily divorced and married to a man who doesn't get upset at me when I'm tired or hurting.", "My similarly sized rat terrier can position herself just diagonally across the middle of the **king sized** bed - making both of us equally uncomfortable.  One of us gets the front feet, the other gets the back!  :p", "We have a California king bed and a jack Russell. The amount of nights he digs his little paws into my ribs while I'm sleeping is insane. And those little guys can stretch! He takes up the whole damn bed most of the time.", "Get into the fb groups Adrenal Fatigue & Thyroid Care and The Attuned Thyroid. Work on your health, love your dog, and get away from this guy. (If you can\u2019t get away for financial reasons, stop sharing your health stuff with him, do whatever you need to keep the peace until you can leave, and focus on getting better.) PCOS is insanely painful and directly connected to your hypothyroidism. NTA", "I have a dachshund/corgi mix and she dead weights, making her heavier than my elderly black lab and border collie combined. I can't sleep if she gets in bed with me but the big dogs aren't a problem.", "I was thinking about an adult black Newfoundland i saw last week... Then realised i was just a little bit wrong lol", "This brought back memories and made me laugh! Mine is now 22, but man, once he got a \u201cbig bed\u201d (no rails) he would teleport into the middle of our bed. We\u2019d wake up, and there he was. Head butts and kicks, lol.", "My smaller cat is such a bed hog and good luck trying to move her. She can will herself to weigh 100 lbs. I'm convinced of it.", "I have lost count of how many times I have woken up to find myself at the edge of the bed and my 15 pound chihuahua jack russel mix stretched across the rest of the bed.", "As a life-long cat servant, I theorize cats can become denser and therefore heavier at will. It's a reflex that occurs when people attempt to move or lift them from their preferred sleeping or lounging position.\n\nMy husband has several degrees in biology and environmental science and fully agrees this phenomenon exists.", "hahahahahahahaha", "Ah So, magic is a yes?"]}
