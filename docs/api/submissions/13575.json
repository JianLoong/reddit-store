Then, work to get the documents you need, such as birth certificate and state ID/driver's license, and work to get his documents, too. Tell him why. It's so you can go to the courthouse to get married.\n\nYou will need a marriage license. After you get the license, follow your state's required waiting period. While waiting, find out where to take the license so you can get married. Some states use a judge, others use a justice of the peace. Most mayors can officiate. You may have a friend who is ordained, ask around. Once you decide upon an officiant, make an appointment if needed, show up with 2 adult witnesses if required, maybe bring the kid, and then let the legal process take place.\n\nCongrats, you're a wife, and the automatic legal step-parent of your husband's kids.\n\nThen get an adoption lawyer so you can legally adopt the kid.

Legal marriage is two people forming a couple to enter a contract with the government that provides 1138 rights and responsibilities to protect your union.\n\nThe thing is, OP, I don't think your man really wants to be legally wed to you. He hasn't shown indication of trying, yet, has he? I anticipate that if you tell him to shit or get off the pot, to either marry you (thus making you a legal step-parent) or you are leaving, he will accept your resignation.

Guardianship papers, a will, and a POA can establish legal rights as a co-parent.  Marriage is a complex legal relationship and not everyone wants that. Also, a step-parent adoption would require a termination of parental rights by the bio-mom, which I doubt she would consent to.

That is some serious,medical neglect. You did the right thing taking  that girl to the doctor.", "NTA. Step-mom\u2019s mother was obviously gravely mistaken about what needed to be done. You did the right thing and step-mom should be thanking you, not giving you shit. They endangered her and should be ashamed.", "NTA nurses aren\u2019t doctors", ">I had no right to take her to the doctor, since mother in law looked at it and said it was fine.\n\nYou DO have the right........her FATHER gave it to you.....\n\nAnd the **DOCTOR** said it was a very serious and contagious infection.\n\nYour step daughter could have **DIED**.............\n\nAnd as a \"thank you\" she called you a cow?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with her.\n\nSave the text, email or whatever she used to communicate and tell your partner to fight for full custody to protect his daughter from that **IDIOT**\n\nNTA", "NTA. You put the child's welfare first. You're a better parent than the parents.", "Would this count as child neglect as they planned to not get her treatment and the doctor said it was serious? That the child could have died from the infection? I\u2019d get the doctors report and go to court for custody and neglect", "NTA but also why are you posting in what world would you have been TA for taking a sick child to the doctor", "So if she would\u2019ve died, they would\u2019ve flipped to why didn\u2019t you or anyone take her to the doctor.", "NTA. You need to call cps asap.", "This kid's life is in danger.\nNTA.", "NTA for taking her to the doctor. \n\nI would suggest looking up the legal advice page on reddit and asking for help in moving forward. Also, if you are not happy with your lawyer, you can get a second opinion.", "NTA. It sounds like your stepdaughter would be in for a lot of problems if you hadn\u2019t taken her.\n\nAlso how many days had it been since her grandma had looked at it? Because if it was right after it first appeared and it\u2019s been there that long, she might not even have the same opinion when you took her as she did when she saw it. \n\nI don\u2019t think there was anything wrong with saying she\u2019s not a doctor, mind you, just your step-daughter\u2019s mom sounds a little unhinged and I wonder if she\u2019s even representing that correctly or if she just didn\u2019t want to bother.", ".....because you would report yourselves for neglect.......? Lawyer. ASAP.", "There's just a massive amount of projection going on based on nothing OP has written.", "no you haven't missed anything, ppl are speculating wildly (and, according to OP's replies, incorrectly) in the comments.", "Assuming this is in the USA... \nIt's an expensive and/or time consuming process. Who reports to \"court\"? You can't just \"check in\". Family court is an absolute nightmare.

Was she supposed to charge for it? Maybe she actually enjoys sex and is glad she's having it even though she's not married.", "I don't think the dad can just cut off bio mom, and based on the fact that they have a lawyer they're trying to do the best. And what do you mean free sex? Like, should I have been charging all these years? I'll have to tell my boyfriend he's run up a tab, since I'm \"unmarried wife\".", "I never said her advice should be taken as fact. I said putting the word nurse in scare quotes means she's not actually a nurse.", "Shit or even can be married.

I couldn't downvote that comment fast enough, and there are still 60 something people who upvoted it. Sheesh. Some people have a severely misguided view of how things work.", "Right?? This had zero to do with their relationship lol!\nSome people are bitter and lonely (see I can guess too :))", "Yea, I kept reading through multiple times and checked OP's comments, yet there was nothing indicating anything about the fiance being toxic/terrible/unsupportive.

They're off their rocker. Good for you for saving your step-daughter and congrats on your upcoming nuptials!! :)", "Colorado does! Step parents have just as much rights as bio parents.
