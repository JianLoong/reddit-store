You have co-parented a child from age 3 to 10 without the benefits that legal marriage provides to couples with children? \n\nSeven years of being an unmarried bride is way too long. And I'm not saying that you should legally bind to him now, not armed with all of this information.\n\nOn the contrary. The more info you share, the worse it sounds. You've been taken advantage of. You have been used. This man is not going to marry you. Why should he? The sex and co-parenting are given freely, and I'm sure you pay money of your own into the budget already. You have been duped into raising a child that you will never get custody of, ever.\n\nThis nonsense will continue as long as you allow it to go on. He won't change. His ex won't change. His mom won't change.\n\nHe is using you, and he doesn't even care that you have developed feelings for his child that you have raised without legal protection. Now you're stuck with deep emotions for, and a parental bond with, a child that is a legal stranger to you.\n\nI think you're only staying out of love for the child. Consider that this could be harming the child because this man who doesn't want to marry you can take this kid away from you at any time, and you will have no legal recourse.\n\nProtect yourself first, because this child has a enough problems already with their bio family. It's time for the father to either make you a legal parent or spend his life having to explain to the kid why you left.\n\nStaying in this dysfunctional situation is not as helpful to the child as you may think.\n\nSeven years!

This makes her partner an AH for allowing such a situation to ever occur.", "She is 10, and those hormones man tell you what. Hindsight is 20/20.

Count the dollars you have given to this attorney, and count the number of times he has told your \"fiance\" to wife you and make you a legal step-parent.\n\nThe lawyer is not doing the child or you any favors.", "Does the attorney also represent her mother? You should have separate lawyers.", "No he hasn't, this is the first I'm hearing about this. Could you go into more detail or some suggestions of what to look up?", "No, she claims she has an attorney but a doubt it.", "Yes. Look up marriage law in your state. Some states require blood testing prior to granting a marriage certificate. Find out what is required for a legal wedding to take place. Then, work to get the documents you need, such as birth certificate and state ID/driver's license, and work to get his documents, too. Tell him why. It's so you can go to the courthouse to get married.\n\nYou will need a marriage license. After you get the license, follow your state's required waiting period. While waiting, find out where to take the license so you can get married. Some states use a judge, others use a justice of the peace. Most mayors can officiate. You may have a friend who is ordained, ask around. Once you decide upon an officiant, make an appointment if needed, show up with 2 adult witnesses if required, maybe bring the kid, and then let the legal process take place.\n\nCongrats, you're a wife, and the automatic legal step-parent of your husband's kids.\n\nThen get an adoption lawyer so you can legally adopt the kid. Use stories like this to show how the bio mom is unfit and needs to relinquish custody.\n\nBut first you need to have a legal marriage. Don't let him make excuses. Don't try to plan a celebration or tie a public and/or religious ceremony to it. Legal marriage is two people forming a couple to enter a contract with the government that provides 1138 rights and responsibilities to protect your union.\n\nThe thing is, OP, I don't think your man really wants to be legally wed to you. He hasn't shown indication of trying, yet, has he? I anticipate that if you tell him to shit or get off the pot, to either marry you (thus making you a legal step-parent) or you are leaving, he will accept your resignation. He won't take you seriously. Why should he? He has 7 years of evidence showing that you will act as a wife and parent without being one.\n\nOP, really, think about why he hasn't yet married you, and look at all the problems you endure daily, weekly, monthly, because he hasn't made you legal yet. \n\nIf he is your forever man, make him prove it. Not with a diamond, not with a party. With a trip to court to do the legal deed.\n\nA child's life is being ruined over this. Why? Ask him.", "I understand your concern poster, he's wanted to marry me for the last 5 years, I have put it on hold because I was using the single mom grant to get my associates degree, I did get it!, I'm almost 60k in debt now and his debt is almost cleared, he made me ring when he asked me it was really sweet, but it broke because I was to excited to wear it before he finished it. I did get a different one. Then COVID happened and there are still restrictions with our court house because of it. We also had a house fire 2 years ago and lost everything and had to rebuild our lives. We do have a plan to get married in August.\n\nThank you for your concern though!"]}
