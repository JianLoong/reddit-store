The judge threw out my training because I worked with the elderly and not children.", "This whole situation seems bizarre and complicated and surely way beyond whatever the character limit is on this forum. It seems like a mixed bag from the info you\u2019ve provided.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s experienced a similar version of this scenario, I can personally say that there\u2019s definitely two versions of this story, and you\u2019re both probably a little wrong and a little right.\n\nIf you had bio-father\u2019s permission to take the child to the doctor, then ofc you\u2019re not an AH for this action alone. I do think you\u2019re an AH for the \u201cnot a doctor,\u201d remark to a 10yo, but you seem to have realized your mistake there from what I gather. \n\nI don\u2019t think the child\u2019s mother is necessarily an AH for anything except the insults about you. \n\nA nurse is trained in triage and it\u2019s well within the scope of a nurse to assess a symptom and give advice on the level of care needed ie home care vs doctor\u2019s office vs ER etc. The rash may not have been as bad when the grandmother originally looked at it and you state in your post that the fever didn\u2019t start until she was back with her father. It sounds like bio-mom made the best decision for the child for the symptoms she was having when she was with bio-mom. It\u2019s a decision I would\u2019ve made.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for what a judge ruled about your training as a CNA, but CNA\u2019s are not trained in assessment. Their skill set is basic hygiene, ADLs, and VS. If the child was having symptoms of UTIs that was being treated with hygiene alone, then it would fall under neglect. If bio-dad was able to see symptoms and I\u2019m guessing you did, too, then the solution shouldn\u2019t have depended on the bio-mom\u2019s feedback. Again, I understand that symptoms were probably taking place at the bio-mom\u2019s, too, and she\u2019s just as complicit in the neglect. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like you and bio-dad have grown from that incident and recognized worsening symptoms in the child when the rash/fever appeared and sought medical advice regardless of protest from bio-mom.\n\nI understand this is a difficult situation (I lived it) and there\u2019s never going to be a black/white answer. Co-parenting is done in gray areas. But if I could go back to when my daughter was a child, the one bit of advice I would give myself is to have empathy and look at it from all sides. No judgement. Raising children is hard and no one is perfect.\n\nMy judgment, I guess, is ESH except the child. Just continue to do better and learn and grow and give all of the co-parents the same benefit of doubt that you\u2019d want.
