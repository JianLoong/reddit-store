I didn\u2019t respond to all of them but I did read most and think about the situation. First thing I did was talk to Mark. He assured me that my behavior never seemed flirtatious or inappropriate. I told him that I gonna cutoff the rest of them. He told me he would do the same but I told him not to. I appreciate the support but I\u2019m the one having the issue. \n\nI didn\u2019t speak to anyone from that group except for Mark for a couple weeks. I\u2019ve been meeting new people and it\u2019s going fine. Then a few days later, some came by my room and wanted to talk to me. To my surprise, it was the four people (Chris, Emma, Ty, and Mica)  who I wasn\u2019t as close with as the others.\n\nWe started talking and the first thing they did was apologize for the situation and for making me uncomfortable. I asked them one of my biggest things I was curious about; \u2018why were the comments directed at only me?\u2019 Here\u2019s what I learned: Jada told them she talked to me and they could make comments to me and I would be okay with it, but said she talked to Mark and he said he would be uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t believe this until they showed me the messages. I never told Jada this and I doubt she talked to Mark, so she lied, and that\u2019s when it started. I was still confused on why she would make them in the first place. Ty, Mica, and Chris didn\u2019t know but Emma showed me her messages with Jada. \n\nTo the person who asked if Jada has a crush on Mark, you are incorrect. Jada has a crush on me. For the past four months. Even though I\u2019m not the best socially, once I saw the messages, I\u2019m pretty sure she was jealous of Mark and was trying to make me uncomfortable around him. The other 3 saw the messages and thought the same thing. So she was jealous. Nobody aside from Emma knew this though. They just joined in because they thought it would be funny. \n\nI asked \u2018why is me being uncomfortable a joke or funny?\u2019 They didn\u2019t have a response. I told them what alot of people told me in the replies: How it was bullying and homophobic to make such remarks and disguising them as \u2018jokes\u2019 is just an excuse. I acknowledged that I should\u2019ve said something sooner, but it also should have never gotten to that point. They again apologized and asked if I could forgive them. Truthfully I have already gotten past the situation and moved on.\n\nUltimately, I did decide to give these four a second chance. The fact they came to talk, apologize, explain, and weren\u2019t on the defensive or dismissive when I was explaining how I felt or what made them wrong; I think that\u2019s a good sign. It will take a bit longer to fully regain my trust but haven\u2019t had any issues since then.", "created_utc": 1684790902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13p3z3f/update_aita_for_storming_out_a_restaurant_and/", "score": 945, "replies": ["You handled this so gracefully", "Wow, did not expect that plot twist. Obviously I'm not pro-jealous scheming, but hers was just.....really dumb. \"Let me get closer to this guy by constantly telling him I think he's gay and that he should be with our other friend.\"\n\nGlad those people had the balls to tell you what happened and apologize. I would be wary of Emma just because she knew everything and still went along with it until it got out of control, but glad that you had people who were able to reflect and own their poor choices.\n\nGood for you for getting the AHs out of your life.", "Jada really needs to work on her flirting.", "Love to see a positive update like this one!", "Good work, OP.", "The 4 people that sought you out to apologize deserve your friendship. You all have bright futures ahead of you. Best of luck, OP.", "wow u handled this incredibly well. EXTRA kudos questioning their behavior even after they apologized - glad ur making new friends dude and good luck w school", "Great job OP!!", "This made my night. It\u2019s heartwarming to hear a good outcome. Thank you. I think you found the real friends.", "Jada...has problems. \n\nLike, she's not the first person to tease the individual she likes, but to accuse you of being homosexual and joke about you being in love with another guy is...like that just makes no sense.\n\nHopefully the four you forgave will use this as a chance to grow and mature.", "Jada needs to work on a lot of things!", "You handled this well and I\u2019m impressed with the maturity and open conversation that the 4 friends and you displayed.", "Nice", "Wow, this whole thing blew up in Jada's face.\n\nGlad that these four were willing to sort out this mess. I have a feeling Jada had been doubling down on her lies that you were okay with it, and they finally decided to get your side of the story. Very well handled on your end.", "Right? For someone who is so afraid that they dont know how to navigate social interactions, OP did an amazing job at this. \n\nIm really just oddly super proud of a total stranger right now lol.", "deserves a bit of a strong word, but that's just me being pedantic", "I agree, maybe not deserving of his friendship per se, but deserving of a second chance.\n\nPeople do dumb things and act like AH\u2019s sometimes.  The fact they took responsibility, apologized multiple times, and seem to be trying to move beyond it shows they\u2019re at least trying to grow and do better.", "This was a great update! Nice job on the way you handled everything. Jada seems crazy, that was crazy behavior.", "Wow OP, you handled the situation perfectly!", "I\u2019m guessing Jada was testing the waters trying to figure out if OP is gay or not before she made a move. That\u2019s the only thing I can think of that makes even a tiny bit of sense.", "Jada needs to work on being a decent person WORTHY of dating first.", "I doubt that she suspected Op was gay. I suspect Jade is also socially awkward and perhaps defaults to teasing/bullying as her weird way of flirting. You know, like in 4th grade. \n\nNot excusing her behavior, but she clearly has issues appropriately interacting with people she likes. I\u2019ve known some people that actively push away people their attracted to and then rationalize that it was never meant to be to cope with the self-induced rejection. \n\nOP sure dodged a bullet and I\u2019m glad to hear your other friends took your side once they understood the reality of it all.", "But how? I agree with the top comment, I am grilling you for being gay and then suddenly \"oh you seem straighter today, let's date\". Plus whatever the reason that person (Jena I think) is too manipulative and easy to lie. Red flags all over. And besides sexual orientation, persisting in making me uncomfortable and making your presence unbearable to me is a \"great\" way for me to become attracted to you(?!). That girl is not a friend or a partner material", "Deserve's got nothing to do with it.", "She was manipulative and also behaving like a 9 y/o, pulling her crush hair", "Jada sounds like she's 5 years old", "This second batch sounds like actual worthy friends.. hope it goes well OP!", "\"why is me being uncomfortable a joke or funny?\"\n\nI sincerely hope they think carefully about this question for a long, long time.", "At least halfway decent people, and even those are hard to come by.", "This is so important.\n\nStupid conditioning means there's always a part of my brain feeling sorry for the Jada's of stories like this, maybe wishing she'd played it differently. But she doesn't deserve any sympathy and not only tormented op for a sustained \nperiod but excluded him from his friend group. Thanks for summing up the healthy response in a sentence.", "Honestly in this day and age, halfway decent is the best I think I can hope for \ud83d\ude05", "Makes sense to me", "Especially since they weren't so close.", "Jada is a lying, manipulative asshole.\n\nChris, Emma, Ty, and Mica (and mark for that matter) all sound like decent people.", "This is the double empathy problem in action. Autistic person responsible for managing everyone's communication despite bmtheir communication being very clear and explicit.", "There's a school nurse that could give her some pointers.", "Same! I\u2019m in my forties and I doubt I would have handled this situation so perfectly- great job OOP!", "Maybe she hoped he'd say \"gosh no, why would I want to be with Mark?  I want to be with you!\".", "She was probably hoping OP would quickly get a girlfriend to stop the reading and oh well she is already close so why Not just pick her"]}
