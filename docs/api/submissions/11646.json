I have endometriosis which is painful in general and I'm losing twins so it's a miserable situation. To make matters worse, my husband (28M) had emergency surgery a week ago to remove the lower lobe of his left lung because a benign tumor he had there exploded and we didn't know there was a tumor there in the first place. He's been at home for two days now but he's in a lot of pain and sleeping most of the time. \n\nMy MIL is a bother. We got married young (19&22) and I always knew that I was going to struggle with fertility and because of this, she hated me. I don't think this is racism, but she also made it clear that she wished my husband married someone from his own ethnicity (he's Arab) rather than marrying me, a Somali woman. We are usually very, very low contact with her but when we told FIL about my husband's surgery, he told MIL. MIL offered to stay with us to help care for my husband while I'm recovering from the miscarriage, and I stupidly agreed. She came over the day my husband was released (Saturday) and I kicked her out today. \n\nShe was being pleasant on Saturday, and on Sunday I was asleep for most of the day because I couldn't deal with my cramps and I took some sleeping pills. Today, I was sitting with her in the living room and she was asking me questions about how my husband was feeling on the days leading up to the tumor exploding. I said that he was fine, and then she said \"do you think the miscarriage would've caused the tumor to explode?\" I asked her to elaborate and she said \"You constantly lose your children. The stress of you having this miscarriage probably caused the tumor to explode\". We got into an argument over this and she kept insisting it was my fault. At this point, I decided to kick her out. She started shouting that I couldn't do that and she wanted to speak to my husband (he was sleeping), and I locked our bedroom door so she couldn't disturb him. I called FIL and he came to pick her up.\n\nSince then, I've been bombarded with calls calling me evil and vindictive. Apparently I should've been understanding because her son had a life threatening health emergency and she was emotional. I think my own pain and stress has been clouding my judgement on this situation and I didn't have to kick her out.
