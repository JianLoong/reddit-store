We met Jamie on a night out, and I would say that although he's Kate's bf I consider him a friend.

She asked if I wouldn't mind \"toning down\" my look for the party, and if I could send her a picture of what I was planning to wear. I asked her what this meant and after asking several times if she \"really had to say it\" she asked if I could dress (verbatim) \"basically what \\[I\\] would consider frumpy\" because she really didn't want to be outshone at her own boyfriend's birthday party. When I didn't reply right away she went on to say that she wanted Jamie's full attention that night, which she wouldn't get if I showed up dressed properly. I was a bit annoyed by what she was implying so I said if I was going to be so much of a concern for her, I'd rather just politely decline the invitation. Kate freaked out saying I was being immature by not coming just because I couldn't steal the spotlight. I said it wasn't about that, it was about her making me responsible for whether or not I draw her boyfriend's attention, which is something I've never tried to do nor done as far as I'm aware. She then said it was really important to Jamie that she stand out because his friends and colleagues would be there. I just told her that again, if she was so worried I was going to be distracting everyone, I'd rather not come than feel humiliated from now until the event. I said I would send her Jamie's gift and she could tell him why I wasn't coming. \n\nI guess she didn't tell him the reason because Jamie messaged me saying he knows I'm \"booked\" the night of the party but he'd really like it if I could be there, and asked if I could reorganise so I could come. I hadn't replied, but I got a message from Kate saying she knows Jamie is trying to get me to come and please could I just put my pride aside and come to the party. I asked if she was going to ditch the outfit policing, but she said no, so I said I would not be coming. She didn't reply, but I've since received a couple of texts from mutual friends saying that while her request is ridiculous, Kate is aware of that, she's just desperate to be seen a certain way and even if it's pathetic I would probably feel the same way in her shoes. Other friends I've told (who don't know Kate) say I should not bow to the pressure and that she's nuts for even asking, and I don't disagree, but also I feel bad skipping the party when it's Jamie's birthday and he asked specifically that I come.

She needs to find ways to feel better about herself that doesn't involve dictating what others wear. She's too old for this middle school bs.", "NTA.

Kate sounds exhausting to be friends with. Does she think you\u2019re going to Don a low cut floozy dress like Scarlett O\u2019Hara at Ashley\u2019s birthday party? \n\nI find it so strange that at nearly 30 all of your friends circle seems to have the bandwidth to care about such a non issue. \n\nWhat I think is really happening is that Kate can sense Jamie probably has more than platonic feelings for you and she\u2019s spiraling. To be honest, i would probably cool it on the one on one time with Jamie and the texting. Is he such a good friend dealing with Kate\u2019s drama is worth it?", "NTA. Kate is being jealous, insecure and immature.", "NTA for being you. You will be TA if you don\u2019t show Jamie the texts and let him know the truth about the shallow woman he\u2019s dating. Just wow! If she is this jealous of you already then it sets the tone for all future events. Can you imagine the wedding where Kate is the bride if this is already her attitude for a birthday party. I can see kate being the woman to insist that everyone else wear something ugly so she looks good.", "NTA and you should tell Jaimie exactly why you're not going to be there.  Kate's behavior is ridiculous and immature and she knows that otherwise she'd have told Jaimie herself, but she lied and covered it up.  Or tell her you'll go, but you'll wear whatever tf you want, what's she going to do, block you at the door?", "NTA.\n\nKate's insecurities is not your problem. If she is worried about not having Jamie's attention at the party, she needs to take this up with him. Why do you have to dress a certain way at party to appease Kate and her insecurities.\n\nHonestly, I might have to think that she is a bit jealous of you as well. Why are you the only one she is worried about \"stealing the spotlight\"? Won\u2019t there be other women there?

It's not like you're going to wear a wedding dress to her wedding. Kate has issues. I'd go and wear whatever the hell I wanted. It's HIS birthday party and he is YOUR friend as well as her boyfriend.\n\nKate is just a mean girl. An insecure mean girl but still a mean girl.", "NTA whether you go or don\u2019t go. Parties are for dressing up, relaxing, and having a great time. You should be able to dress any way you want. If you go, wear and do your makeup how you planned to. This is an absolutely ridiculous demand from Kate. Kate comes off as insecure in my opinion. \nNot going is obviously a respectable decision as well. Conflict would be avoided.", "NTA.\n\nIf Jamie loves Kate it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone wears, because Jamie will only care about how amazing Kate is. Kate\u2019s jealousy isn\u2019t your fault or your problem. \n\nStick to your guns. And honestly tell Jamie the reason you chose not to attend and maybe he can tell Kate how idiotic what she\u2019s doing is.

Tell her you think there\u2019s a better way to handle her insecurities than what she has in mind. Plan a shopping trip together and help her pick out something that looks stunning on her and maybe have hair and makeup done together the day of and pick outfits and hair makeup for you that is within your style but slightly less attention gathering than hers.\n\n2. Tell her you\u2019re not doing frumpy but you will compromise and go with a simpler style as a one-time concession to her insecurities but it will not become a habit and any further requests of this sort will damage your friendship. Tell her she\u2019s a wonderful person and her insecurities are best resolved through counseling rather than using friends as props. Then choose an outfit/look that is much simpler than your normal style but which really suits you, and dial your charisma back a bit for the night. Bonus points if you bring a really hot date.\n\nIf you rate your friendship with Jamie a lot higher, then either:\n\n1. Figure out what will both make you comfortable and make his birthday drama free while you still attend part of it and do that for Jamie; or\n\n2. Dress wildly frumpy in a costume way and have fun with it. I dare you to wear a granny dress and bun or a flannel shirt and denim coveralls.  Or pull the old frumpy til partway through gag  where toward the end you say you\u2019re overheated and go to the bathroom and take off your fake glasses, let your beautiful hair down, and remove your frumpy outer layer to reveal a glamorous layer underneath.\n\nIf your own dignity is more important than either friendship, don\u2019t go. Telling Jamie why is optional.", "How is she almost 30 and this immature?! NTA. Don\u2019t miss your friend\u2019s birthday coz she\u2019s insecure", "NTA it sounds like she thinks Jamie is into you, which I have no idea if is the case or not but that won\u2019t be resolved by you changing your outfit for one event. Caving to this will lead to escalating demands. \nJust hold your line, as dispassionately as possible, that you\u2019re either going to an event where you\u2019re asked to have your outfit pre-approved for modesty. Especially where you\u2019ve been singled out for your personal style like this. If you\u2019re willing to go along with a universalised dress code, like if she wants full rights to the colour red or some bullshit like that, then let her know. And let her know that she always stands out regardless of what she wares. And ask her to be honest with her boyfriend since it\u2019s shitty to involve you in a lie like that.", "You should not bow to her insecurities, she needs to deal with that. You do you. NTA", "NTA, but have you considered going dressed up as Velma from Scooby Doo, and explaining your choice of outfit when asked. That should put the cat amongst the pigeons.", "NTA\n\nShe wants you to show up looking like crap so she can look better by comparison. This is beyond pathetic. You should really tell Jamie the truth since she is obviously going to spin this in a way that makes you look bad no matter what you do.", "NTA. Go to the party, dress as you like and carry on as normal. Kate is being immature and ridiculous. She needs to get over her insecurities and realise that Jamie has chosen her regardless of looks.", "NTA, your friend is just being immature, she should be celebrating your win for simply looking good when you make the effort, go to the party and dress up", "NTA. She sees you as competition but because Jaime wants you there, it has blown up in her face. You are taking the high road by not coming. Honestly, if Jaime was interested in you, it doesn't matter what you show up in. But if Kate persists with this dress code nonsense, you should tell her that you aren't going to lie to Jaime any more and will tell him the real reason why you are not coming. He should know what his GF is capable of", "NTA. Kate is asking you not to be yourself. She\u2019s clearly very insecure, but that\u2019s a her issue, not a you issue. I think you\u2019ve handled the situation well.", "NTA. \n\nThe reality is that there will always be more attractive people than Kate or anyone in the room or in the world. The thing Kate needs is to work on her self esteem. What if Jamie's friend shows up and is a super attractive woman? Is Kate going to flip her shit? What if Jamie's coworkers are also hot AF? When will Kate ever measure up? Because all that matters is what Jamie thinks and obviously 3 years in should be enough for Kate to be confident about his feelings for her. \n\nI will say it's odd that Kate hasn't met his friends and colleagues. And if she has, why she's feeling like she needs to be extra impressive. I personally feel like this is an excuse. She sounds like she's been insecure about Jamie and OP's relationship thus this ask. \n\nI think you were respectful in declining. Since Jamie wants you there and you're also friends beyond knowing him as Kate's boyfriend, you can tell him what's going on. You can say the reason you declined is due to Kate's ask. Say you understand she wants to make a good impression and be the apple of his eye but you found it incredibly rude and inappropriate to ask for outfit approval. Suggest that Jamie and Kate consider couples counseling since she seems to have major insecurities and that you hope he has a wonderful birthday party and that you can see him at the next sporting event. No drama, just honesty and still being respectful of Kate's feelings by not going.", "NTA\n\nYou're perfectly valid to stay away as it keeps your dignity and doesn't make your friend look bad.\n\nGoing frumpy would just not be right; it's Jamie's party, not Kate's, and it's humiliating and disrespectful to have your friend enforce a dress code like some kind of schoolteacher. My question is why does she get to set the dress code anyway?\n\nThe solution here seems to be that you are Kate get ready/plan your outfits together, but without compromising your look. Instead take her look up a notch. If she really wants to outshine you, she can do that by going even bolder. If she's not comfortable with that, then so be it.\n\nThe pro play here is to turn up anyway in your least frumpy outfit and let your friend be mad.", "NTA - She is insecure , tell the truth to Jamie", "NTA.", "NTA tell her to forth and multiply with themselves", "NTA. I think there are two better choices though, or you could damage your friendship with Jamie. Either turn up wearing whatever the hell you want to; or explain the dilemma to Jamie and ask for his advice.", "NTA just go in whatever you want to wear, nobody gets to control you like that", "NTA. Nor at all.", "NTA. Your friend is the one being immature, and knows it. The fact that she called you that, is gaslighting!

Why does Kate feel insecure about you, specifically? Is it because you spend a lot of time with her BF platonically? Or is it because in the past, you've been the center-of-attention friend, the extrovert, and she's been happy to let you take the spotlight, but is asking you to tone it down this once? I think that you should absolutely put your foot down, its not ok for a friend to police what you look like because of their own insecurities. But if you are feeling generous to this person who you ostensibly like and want to help, talk to her and find out what exactly is making her anxious. It could be as simple as she's feeling insecure about her appearance, and you always look super amazing so she's freaking out a little bit. In that case you could help her pick out a fantastic outfit that makes her look and feel great. If its insecurity about your relationship with the BF, that needs a whole conversation. FWIW, I've had that conversation, my BFF met her hubby and we got along amazingly well. I didn't know she was upset the whole time because she thought we were flirting, when I legitimately have no romantic interest in him at all. That was almost 15 years ago and while it was an uncomfortable conversation, we cleared the air and are all still friends to this day.", "NTA, congrats on being the Harrison Bergeron of hotness I guess?", "NTA.

Get far away from this chick.", "This has been confirmed by OP in a comment - the nice/expensive clothing.", "Wrong. The problem is that OP dresses up with nice/expensive clothing, and maybe Katie thinks this is a competition that she has to win, so the only way is demanding OP to dress frumpy.", "I wonder if Jamie has/had other female friends that Kate acted the same way towards.

Do note that OPs friend doesn't just mention her other half, but the other men that will be at the party too.
