We met Jamie on a night out, and I would say that although he's Kate's bf I consider him a friend. We share an interest in a particular sport that we text about sometimes and if I have a spare hospitality ticket to one of the sporting fixtures, I will sometimes invite Jamie to go. \n\nJamie's 30th is coming up and Jamie and Kate planned a big party, and I peripherally helped out with logistics when asked. \n\nA few days ago, Kate texted me. She asked if I wouldn't mind \"toning down\" my look for the party, and if I could send her a picture of what I was planning to wear. I asked her what this meant and after asking several times if she \"really had to say it\" she asked if I could dress (verbatim) \"basically what \\[I\\] would consider frumpy\" because she really didn't want to be outshone at her own boyfriend's birthday party. When I didn't reply right away she went on to say that she wanted Jamie's full attention that night, which she wouldn't get if I showed up dressed properly. I was a bit annoyed by what she was implying so I said if I was going to be so much of a concern for her, I'd rather just politely decline the invitation. Kate freaked out saying I was being immature by not coming just because I couldn't steal the spotlight. I said it wasn't about that, it was about her making me responsible for whether or not I draw her boyfriend's attention, which is something I've never tried to do nor done as far as I'm aware. She then said it was really important to Jamie that she stand out because his friends and colleagues would be there. I just told her that again, if she was so worried I was going to be distracting everyone, I'd rather not come than feel humiliated from now until the event. I said I would send her Jamie's gift and she could tell him why I wasn't coming. \n\nI guess she didn't tell him the reason because Jamie messaged me saying he knows I'm \"booked\" the night of the party but he'd really like it if I could be there, and asked if I could reorganise so I could come. I hadn't replied, but I got a message from Kate saying she knows Jamie is trying to get me to come and please could I just put my pride aside and come to the party. I asked if she was going to ditch the outfit policing, but she said no, so I said I would not be coming. She didn't reply, but I've since received a couple of texts from mutual friends saying that while her request is ridiculous, Kate is aware of that, she's just desperate to be seen a certain way and even if it's pathetic I would probably feel the same way in her shoes. Other friends I've told (who don't know Kate) say I should not bow to the pressure and that she's nuts for even asking, and I don't disagree, but also I feel bad skipping the party when it's Jamie's birthday and he asked specifically that I come.

She needs to find ways to feel better about herself that doesn't involve dictating what others wear. She's too old for this middle school bs.", "NTA. She\u2019s jealous of you and/ or your relationship with Jamie. \n\nNever make yourself less for someone else. \n\nI\u2019d go to the party, but look amazing, forget Kate and enjoy yourself with your other friends \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c", "NTA but wooooow I had to check everyone\u2019s ages. Kate sounds exhausting to be friends with. Does she think you\u2019re going to Don a low cut floozy dress like Scarlett O\u2019Hara at Ashley\u2019s birthday party? \n\nI find it so strange that at nearly 30 all of your friends circle seems to have the bandwidth to care about such a non issue. \n\nWhat I think is really happening is that Kate can sense Jamie probably has more than platonic feelings for you and she\u2019s spiraling. To be honest, i would probably cool it on the one on one time with Jamie and the texting. Is he such a good friend dealing with Kate\u2019s drama is worth it?", "NTA. Kate is being jealous, insecure and immature.", "NTA for being you. You will be TA if you don\u2019t show Jamie the texts and let him know the truth about the shallow woman he\u2019s dating. Just wow! If she is this jealous of you already then it sets the tone for all future events. Can you imagine the wedding where Kate is the bride if this is already her attitude for a birthday party. I can see kate being the woman to insist that everyone else wear something ugly so she looks good.", "NTA and you should tell Jaimie exactly why you're not going to be there.  Kate's behavior is ridiculous and immature and she knows that otherwise she'd have told Jaimie herself, but she lied and covered it up.  Or tell her you'll go, but you'll wear whatever tf you want, what's she going to do, block you at the door?", "NTA.\n\nKate's insecurities is not your problem. If she is worried about not having Jamie's attention at the party, she needs to take this up with him. Why do you have to dress a certain way at party to appease Kate and her insecurities.\n\nHonestly, I might have to think that she is a bit jealous of you as well. Why are you the only one she is worried about \"stealing the spotlight\"? Won\u2019t there be other women there? Why are you the only one who is expected to \"tone it down\" and to show her what you will be wearing for the party?", "NTA: Please go, and dress exactly like you would have or better. FAFO", "NTA. She's insecure and that's  not your fault. Tell the  bf why you're not coming. He needs to know what she is doing to his friend's.", "NTA. I've never heard anything like this in my life. It's not like you're going to wear a wedding dress to her wedding. Kate has issues. I'd go and wear whatever the hell I wanted. It's HIS birthday party and he is YOUR friend as well as her boyfriend.\n\nKate is just a mean girl. An insecure mean girl but still a mean girl.", "NTA whether you go or don\u2019t go. Parties are for dressing up, relaxing, and having a great time. You should be able to dress any way you want. If you go, wear and do your makeup how you planned to. This is an absolutely ridiculous demand from Kate. Kate comes off as insecure in my opinion. \nNot going is obviously a respectable decision as well. Conflict would be avoided.", "NTA.\n\nIf Jamie loves Kate it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone wears, because Jamie will only care about how amazing Kate is. Kate\u2019s jealousy isn\u2019t your fault or your problem. \n\nStick to your guns. And honestly tell Jamie the reason you chose not to attend and maybe he can tell Kate how idiotic what she\u2019s doing is. You\u2019re friends, that\u2019s it. \n\nJealousy isn\u2019t a good look on *anyone*.", "NTA.\n\nThe request is ridiculous and unreasonable.\n\nBut:\n\nHow much do you value your friendship with Kate?\n\nHow much do you value your friendship with Jamie?\n\nIf the answer to both questions is \u201chighly\u201d, then   you have a couple of options which leave your dignity intact:\n\n1. Tell her you think there\u2019s a better way to handle her insecurities than what she has in mind. Plan a shopping trip together and help her pick out something that looks stunning on her and maybe have hair and makeup done together the day of and pick outfits and hair makeup for you that is within your style but slightly less attention gathering than hers.\n\n2. Tell her you\u2019re not doing frumpy but you will compromise and go with a simpler style as a one-time concession to her insecurities but it will not become a habit and any further requests of this sort will damage your friendship. Tell her she\u2019s a wonderful person and her insecurities are best resolved through counseling rather than using friends as props. Then choose an outfit/look that is much simpler than your normal style but which really suits you, and dial your charisma back a bit for the night. Bonus points if you bring a really hot date.\n\nIf you rate your friendship with Jamie a lot higher, then either:\n\n1. Figure out what will both make you comfortable and make his birthday drama free while you still attend part of it and do that for Jamie; or\n\n2. Dress wildly frumpy in a costume way and have fun with it. I dare you to wear a granny dress and bun or a flannel shirt and denim coveralls.  Or pull the old frumpy til partway through gag  where toward the end you say you\u2019re overheated and go to the bathroom and take off your fake glasses, let your beautiful hair down, and remove your frumpy outer layer to reveal a glamorous layer underneath.\n\nIf your own dignity is more important than either friendship, don\u2019t go. Telling Jamie why is optional.", "How is she almost 30 and this immature?! NTA. Don\u2019t miss your friend\u2019s birthday coz she\u2019s insecure", "NTA it sounds like she thinks Jamie is into you, which I have no idea if is the case or not but that won\u2019t be resolved by you changing your outfit for one event. Caving to this will lead to escalating demands. \nJust hold your line, as dispassionately as possible, that you\u2019re either going to an event where you\u2019re asked to have your outfit pre-approved for modesty. Especially where you\u2019ve been singled out for your personal style like this. If you\u2019re willing to go along with a universalised dress code, like if she wants full rights to the colour red or some bullshit like that, then let her know. And let her know that she always stands out regardless of what she wares. And ask her to be honest with her boyfriend since it\u2019s shitty to involve you in a lie like that.", "You should not bow to her insecurities, she needs to deal with that. You do you. NTA", "NTA, but have you considered going dressed up as Velma from Scooby Doo, and explaining your choice of outfit when asked. That should put the cat amongst the pigeons.", "NTA\n\nShe wants you to show up looking like crap so she can look better by comparison. This is beyond pathetic. You should really tell Jamie the truth since she is obviously going to spin this in a way that makes you look bad no matter what you do.", "NTA. Go to the party, dress as you like and carry on as normal. Kate is being immature and ridiculous. She needs to get over her insecurities and realise that Jamie has chosen her regardless of looks.", "NTA, your friend is just being immature, she should be celebrating your win for simply looking good when you make the effort, go to the party and dress up", "NTA. She sees you as competition but because Jaime wants you there, it has blown up in her face. You are taking the high road by not coming. Honestly, if Jaime was interested in you, it doesn't matter what you show up in. But if Kate persists with this dress code nonsense, you should tell her that you aren't going to lie to Jaime any more and will tell him the real reason why you are not coming. He should know what his GF is capable of", "NTA. Kate is asking you not to be yourself. She\u2019s clearly very insecure, but that\u2019s a her issue, not a you issue. I think you\u2019ve handled the situation well.", "NTA. \n\nThe reality is that there will always be more attractive people than Kate or anyone in the room or in the world. The thing Kate needs is to work on her self esteem. What if Jamie's friend shows up and is a super attractive woman? Is Kate going to flip her shit? What if Jamie's coworkers are also hot AF? When will Kate ever measure up? Because all that matters is what Jamie thinks and obviously 3 years in should be enough for Kate to be confident about his feelings for her. \n\nI will say it's odd that Kate hasn't met his friends and colleagues. And if she has, why she's feeling like she needs to be extra impressive. I personally feel like this is an excuse. She sounds like she's been insecure about Jamie and OP's relationship thus this ask. \n\nI think you were respectful in declining. Since Jamie wants you there and you're also friends beyond knowing him as Kate's boyfriend, you can tell him what's going on. You can say the reason you declined is due to Kate's ask. Say you understand she wants to make a good impression and be the apple of his eye but you found it incredibly rude and inappropriate to ask for outfit approval. Suggest that Jamie and Kate consider couples counseling since she seems to have major insecurities and that you hope he has a wonderful birthday party and that you can see him at the next sporting event. No drama, just honesty and still being respectful of Kate's feelings by not going.", "NTA\n\nYou're perfectly valid to stay away as it keeps your dignity and doesn't make your friend look bad.\n\nGoing frumpy would just not be right; it's Jamie's party, not Kate's, and it's humiliating and disrespectful to have your friend enforce a dress code like some kind of schoolteacher. My question is why does she get to set the dress code anyway?\n\nThe solution here seems to be that you are Kate get ready/plan your outfits together, but without compromising your look. Instead take her look up a notch. If she really wants to outshine you, she can do that by going even bolder. If she's not comfortable with that, then so be it.\n\nThe pro play here is to turn up anyway in your least frumpy outfit and let your friend be mad.", "NTA - She is insecure , tell the truth to Jamie", "NTA.", "NTA tell her to forth and multiply with themselves", "NTA. I think there are two better choices though, or you could damage your friendship with Jamie. Either turn up wearing whatever the hell you want to; or explain the dilemma to Jamie and ask for his advice.", "NTA just go in whatever you want to wear, nobody gets to control you like that", "NTA. Nor at all.", "NTA. Your friend is the one being immature, and knows it. The fact that she called you that, is gaslighting! I would seriously be reconsidering my friendship with such a jealous friend if I were you.", "Info: I know this is probably gonna sound bad but how good are you two looking compared to each other?", "ESH\n\nAs someone else mentioned, Jamie is the one who will miss out, and he won't understand why. You should let Kate know that you will be coming, you will be dressing the same way you always dress for these events, and that if she brings it up at all you'll let Jamie know why your attendance has been uncertain.", "YTA to Jamie for ditching his party because of her. My response would have been 'lol, don't be ridiculous, see you there'.", "ESH.\nShe shouldn't dictate what you wear.\nYou amd Jaime seem a bit too close and seems to care alot about your whereabouts.\n\nYes its not right of her to ask you such a thing but my god... Just do it. Your friend wants to shine for that one night so let her . Its not about you.\n\nShe needs to think on why Jaime would be distracted by you and I am wondering the same thing and hoe your interactions are with one another.", "Just wondering would the request be outrageous if it was their wedding?

Why does Kate feel insecure about you, specifically? Is it because you spend a lot of time with her BF platonically? Or is it because in the past, you've been the center-of-attention friend, the extrovert, and she's been happy to let you take the spotlight, but is asking you to tone it down this once? I think that you should absolutely put your foot down, its not ok for a friend to police what you look like because of their own insecurities. But if you are feeling generous to this person who you ostensibly like and want to help, talk to her and find out what exactly is making her anxious. It could be as simple as she's feeling insecure about her appearance, and you always look super amazing so she's freaking out a little bit. In that case you could help her pick out a fantastic outfit that makes her look and feel great. If its insecurity about your relationship with the BF, that needs a whole conversation. FWIW, I've had that conversation, my BFF met her hubby and we got along amazingly well. I didn't know she was upset the whole time because she thought we were flirting, when I legitimately have no romantic interest in him at all. That was almost 15 years ago and while it was an uncomfortable conversation, we cleared the air and are all still friends to this day.", "NTA, congrats on being the Harrison Bergeron of hotness I guess?", "NTA.

But, I do wonder if she'd appreciate your advice about what she's wearing?

Offer to help her do her makeup and make sure she looks utterly amazing? \n\nI know that this is probably the last thing on your mind in this situation- she has no right to tell you how you should be dressing to a party unless there is a dress code for everyone, but maybe something like this might help her with those insecurities in a proactive way? Don't know if it would, but it might? \n\nI know for my friends helping each other to look utterly amazing is half the fun of going out. And it's something you do less as you get older.

This one is just for OP and telling her to look frumpy while everyone is allowed to dressed accordingly.", "It is when only one specific person is being presented with a dress code.", "well no not really, she wants OP to dress 'OPs idea of frumpy', which implies that OP normally dresses skimpy and Kate wants something a teensy bit more modest.", "Bridesmaid's dresses an awful colour with big puffy sleeves!!", ">but I would guess this comes from a level of insecurity for how her bf likely fawns over OP.\n\nSo if a woman is being an AH to another woman because she's insecure, it has to be the man's fault?", "Except then she wouldn't have referred to having OP \"outshone\" her, lol", "Ooooh the lovely tantrum this would cause lol\n\nI can just imagine Kate having a cow and telling anyone who\u2019d listen that OP is horrible for refusing to dress frumpy upon her request.\n\nDefinitely do this OP. NTA", "I think you\u2019re really the only person who can answer whether or not you\u2019re the asshole in this situation. Only you really know if you got a boob job or a BBL and like to dress to show it off (which is absolutely your right\u2014no shade intended) and Jamie\u2019s a boob/ass guy and Kate is insecure about being flat chested/assed etc. Only you know if you take secret joy from knowing you could probably get Jamie to leave Kate for you if you wanted, OR if you genuinely don\u2019t believe he\u2019s attracted to you in any way and Kate\u2019s projecting her own insecurities into you. \n\nThe way you\u2019ve framed your question, it seems like you\u2019re NTA, but you and I both know that the dynamics around friendship, attraction and insecurity are incredibly complex and not always (or ever) logical. We have no way of knowing whether you\u2019re trying to get validation for being a shitty friend or if she is. \n\nIf they\u2019re both important to you as friends, it might be worth talking to her with some empathy and seeing if there\u2019s an outfit you can agree on that makes you both feel good (where you still feel like your well-put-together, stylish self, and she doesn\u2019t feel outgunned.) I don\u2019t think she\u2019s handling her insecurity well, but who among us does?! If you care about her, you *could* try to work with her on this, even though you\u2019re not in any way obligated to do so. If you choose this hill to die on (which again, would absolutely be your right) then you have to be prepared for the friendship to die on this hill too.", "YTA here. Not a big one, but a little. You're putting an ideological position (\"i will dress how i want\") over a friend's comfort. Her reasons for asking you to tone it down aren't super, but... well she's basically just asking you not to wear white at her wedding. She wants to feel like the prettiest girl there. She's probably constantly insecure about her looks and thinks people harbor thoughts like \"Jamie could do so much better\"\n\nAs friends part of our job is to help our friends be better. You could say \"look, ill do this for you this time, but you really need to get your self esteem and insecurities sorted out\"\n\n\nIf you can't do that, you probably have to ask yourself why it's so important to *you* that you're dressed to kill. Do you not feel valued unless you're perceived as beautiful?", "I think you should contact the boyfriend and tell him the truth as to why you dont wanna go to the part. Its not fair on you to have to dress down just so she feels good about herself. She is projecting her insecurities on to you.", "What do you mean by \u201cdidn\u2019t really rate Kate\u201d?", "ESH So you know his friends judge her based on her looks, and you know you\u2019re more conventionally attractive and probably more the type that he and his friend prefers, but you still hang out with him one on one and thinks she\u2019s fine with it? At this point you\u2019re kind of being oblivious on purpose. Obviously she needs to sort out her insecurities instead of blaming you, but you\u2019re not reading the room. The bit about her not getting Jamie\u2019s full attention makes it sound like he\u2019s been splitting his attention between you two.", "You\u2019re married and she\u2019s still freaking out? Was your spouse going to the party with you? Time to have a heart to heart with Katie about why she is losing her mind.", "Wait... she's not only implying that you're going to run off with her boyfriend, but that you'd be ditching *your spouse* as you did so? That's... *galacticly* inappropriate.\n\nMy opinion of Katie was fairly low as it was, but this is a full-blown insult to your character that I don't know if I'd move past.\n\nThese are all your friends, and you know them best, so please feel free to act as you choose. But you are NTA here.", "It definitely could be more diplomatic but this is assuming OPs friend acts rationally. If she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019s given up the opportunity to have any control over the narrative without first having to convince their mutual friends that Kate lied. Not saying Kate would do that but admittedly based on her request of OP, I\u2019d be concerned that she would.", "I would screenshoted all their convo and send him. Oh and bought big bag of popcorn!", "From which I guess that nobody else has a track record of dressing inappropriately. I suspect that the OP's \"frumpily\" is everyone else's \"normally\".\n\nAnd she doesn't have to go.", "orrrr... OP usually wears tailored brand-names and always looks chic, put-together, and fashionable.  Katie wants her to tone down the upscale vibe so her Dillard's wrap-dress doesn't seem so mid-scale....", "No.", "No, it doesn\u2019t at all, but OP met Jamie three years ago and has been friends with Kate for far longer. If this is the first time she\u2019s EVER said something like this in over three years of friendship, then it\u2019s not about OP it\u2019s about Jamie/Kate\u2019s relationship. \n\nOnce again, not OP\u2019s fault or problem- just answering your question in this specific context.", "Of course, men are horn dogs 24/7 and obviously can't have women friends without wanting to bang them. /s", "But she's not asking OP to tone it down. She's not asking to lighten the make up or cover the girls. She's asking her to dull her look so that she doesn't outshine her. \n\nWTF kind of friend asks that? Then what...the engagement party? the wedding? The baby announcement? Gender reveal? Baby shower? Anniversaries? All birthdays? \n\nWhy should anyone be asked to dress and feel less than her best?  To me that is the epitome of suppression. I mean, damn, give her a freaking nuns habit and guilt her looks.", "> As friends a part of our job is to help our friends be better \n\nOh, so exactly the opposite of what Kate is doing", "Breaking news: OP is perfectly justified in putting her own bodily autonomy over another person's insecurities", ">Also, she said you're 'booked' for the night; what do you do for a living?  What sort of bookings do you normally get?\n\nI think you're reading into that too much; being \"booked\" is a turn of phrase that just means someone is busy or already has other plans.", "You are disgusting.", "In British English, I believe it would mean that they didn\u2019t like her much. Not that they were rating Kate\u2019s looks and decided she was a 5/10 or something.", "Didn\u2019t think much of her", "Counterpoint: why does Kate even know that his friends initially didn't think she was attractive enough (that's the implication, right?). I can't fathom it came up in conversation in Kate's presence - did Jamie *tell* her? If my friends didn't think a new partner of mine was conventionally attractive enough, I would take it to the grave (and also probably get new friends). Something is sus here.", "This. With her comments, her asking him out one on one, and her being friends with the girl first... It feels like OP is digging the attention of someone else's boyfriend. Sounds like she is getting a kick out of being the \"hot friend,\" and she is into the drama. So, idk that the insecurity of the friend is the only thing at play. How much has her insecurity been influenced by OP treating her like her less? Or by OP constantly stomping on her friends boundaries? She shouldn't be projecting her insecurities onto others, but it also doesn't sound like OP is really much of a friend to the GF.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f is the way.", "Lots and lots popcorn.", "And block both of them.. Because if op still keep in touch with Jamie, Kate will said 'she ruin my relationship blah blah bla'too much drama... But if Jamie keep in touch or trying to find op.. Not op fault anyway", "*Squints*\n\nI think we found Kate.", "That's all complete speculation. None of that information is in the post. You're just making things up. \n\nYou're right, she doesn't. Nor should she when she's being treated unfairly. So she should just tell him why she isn't going to make it, not suck up to these insecure demands.", "Yeah, hairdressers and tattoo artists get booked for weeks in advance so that is definitely a weird implication lol", "Her friend felt the need to to her to tone it down a bit. That's a bit of a giveaway.", "Seriously. Some women can wear jeans and a plain white tshirt and look very attractive because they have boobs and the \u201cright\u201d waist to hip ratio. In order for them to look \u201cfrumpy\u201d they have to wear clothing 3 sizes too big. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how OP dresses regularly but we do now the girlfriend asked her to dress frumpy. It\u2019s OP\u2019s right not to attend. And tell the boyfriend the truth if she wishes.", "Because that's Kate.", "Or a top can look \"modest\" on a smaller chested woman and \"slutty\" on a larger chested one. It's complete BS and a massive double standard.", " Read her comments, she doesn't dress in a revealing manner. Op is attractive, girlfriend is jealous, its that simple, but here you are talking about track records of her dressing inappropriately with no mention of that amywhere at all. People like you, like the girlfriend, need to get over yourselves. You'll never shine with attitudes like this.", "> Read her comments, she doesn't dress in a revealing manner.\n\nShe says. Well, she would, wouldn't she?"]}
