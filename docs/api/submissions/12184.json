We met Jamie on a night out, and I would say that although he's Kate's bf I consider him a friend. We share an interest in a particular sport that we text about sometimes and if I have a spare hospitality ticket to one of the sporting fixtures, I will sometimes invite Jamie to go. \n\nJamie's 30th is coming up and Jamie and Kate planned a big party, and I peripherally helped out with logistics when asked. \n\nA few days ago, Kate texted me. She asked if I wouldn't mind \"toning down\" my look for the party, and if I could send her a picture of what I was planning to wear. I asked her what this meant and after asking several times if she \"really had to say it\" she asked if I could dress (verbatim) \"basically what \\[I\\] would consider frumpy\" because she really didn't want to be outshone at her own boyfriend's birthday party. When I didn't reply right away she went on to say that she wanted Jamie's full attention that night, which she wouldn't get if I showed up dressed properly. I was a bit annoyed by what she was implying so I said if I was going to be so much of a concern for her, I'd rather just politely decline the invitation. Kate freaked out saying I was being immature by not coming just because I couldn't steal the spotlight. I said it wasn't about that, it was about her making me responsible for whether or not I draw her boyfriend's attention, which is something I've never tried to do nor done as far as I'm aware. She then said it was really important to Jamie that she stand out because his friends and colleagues would be there. I just told her that again, if she was so worried I was going to be distracting everyone, I'd rather not come than feel humiliated from now until the event. I said I would send her Jamie's gift and she could tell him why I wasn't coming. \n\nI guess she didn't tell him the reason because Jamie messaged me saying he knows I'm \"booked\" the night of the party but he'd really like it if I could be there, and asked if I could reorganise so I could come. I hadn't replied, but I got a message from Kate saying she knows Jamie is trying to get me to come and please could I just put my pride aside and come to the party. I asked if she was going to ditch the outfit policing, but she said no, so I said I would not be coming. She didn't reply, but I've since received a couple of texts from mutual friends saying that while her request is ridiculous, Kate is aware of that, she's just desperate to be seen a certain way and even if it's pathetic I would probably feel the same way in her shoes. Other friends I've told (who don't know Kate) say I should not bow to the pressure and that she's nuts for even asking, and I don't disagree, but also I feel bad skipping the party when it's Jamie's birthday and he asked specifically that I come.

She needs to find ways to feel better about herself that doesn't involve dictating what others wear. She's too old for this middle school bs.", "NTA. She\u2019s jealous of you and/ or your relationship with Jamie. \n\nNever make yourself less for someone else. \n\nI\u2019d go to the party, but look amazing, forget Kate and enjoy yourself with your other friends \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c", "NTA but wooooow I had to check everyone\u2019s ages. Kate sounds exhausting to be friends with. Does she think you\u2019re going to Don a low cut floozy dress like Scarlett O\u2019Hara at Ashley\u2019s birthday party? \n\nI find it so strange that at nearly 30 all of your friends circle seems to have the bandwidth to care about such a non issue. \n\nWhat I think is really happening is that Kate can sense Jamie probably has more than platonic feelings for you and she\u2019s spiraling. To be honest, i would probably cool it on the one on one time with Jamie and the texting. Is he such a good friend dealing with Kate\u2019s drama is worth it?", "NTA. Kate is being jealous, insecure and immature.", "NTA for being you. You will be TA if you don\u2019t show Jamie the texts and let him know the truth about the shallow woman he\u2019s dating. Just wow! If she is this jealous of you already then it sets the tone for all future events. Can you imagine the wedding where Kate is the bride if this is already her attitude for a birthday party. I can see kate being the woman to insist that everyone else wear something ugly so she looks good.", "NTA and you should tell Jaimie exactly why you're not going to be there.  Kate's behavior is ridiculous and immature and she knows that otherwise she'd have told Jaimie herself, but she lied and covered it up.  Or tell her you'll go, but you'll wear whatever tf you want, what's she going to do, block you at the door?", "NTA.\n\nKate's insecurities is not your problem. If she is worried about not having Jamie's attention at the party, she needs to take this up with him. Why do you have to dress a certain way at party to appease Kate and her insecurities.\n\nHonestly, I might have to think that she is a bit jealous of you as well. Why are you the only one she is worried about \"stealing the spotlight\"? Won\u2019t there be other women there? Why are you the only one who is expected to \"tone it down\" and to show her what you will be wearing for the party?", "NTA: Please go, and dress exactly like you would have or better. FAFO", "NTA. She's insecure and that's  not your fault. Tell the  bf why you're not coming. He needs to know what she is doing to his friend's.", "NTA. I've never heard anything like this in my life. It's not like you're going to wear a wedding dress to her wedding. Kate has issues. I'd go and wear whatever the hell I wanted. It's HIS birthday party and he is YOUR friend as well as her boyfriend.\n\nKate is just a mean girl. An insecure mean girl but still a mean girl.", "NTA whether you go or don\u2019t go. Parties are for dressing up, relaxing, and having a great time. You should be able to dress any way you want. If you go, wear and do your makeup how you planned to. This is an absolutely ridiculous demand from Kate. Kate comes off as insecure in my opinion. \nNot going is obviously a respectable decision as well. Conflict would be avoided.", "NTA.\n\nIf Jamie loves Kate it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone wears, because Jamie will only care about how amazing Kate is. Kate\u2019s jealousy isn\u2019t your fault or your problem. \n\nStick to your guns. And honestly tell Jamie the reason you chose not to attend and maybe he can tell Kate how idiotic what she\u2019s doing is. You\u2019re friends, that\u2019s it. \n\nJealousy isn\u2019t a good look on *anyone*.", "NTA.\n\nThe request is ridiculous and unreasonable.\n\nBut:\n\nHow much do you value your friendship with Kate?\n\nHow much do you value your friendship with Jamie?\n\nIf the answer to both questions is \u201chighly\u201d, then   you have a couple of options which leave your dignity intact:\n\n1. Tell her you think there\u2019s a better way to handle her insecurities than what she has in mind. Plan a shopping trip together and help her pick out something that looks stunning on her and maybe have hair and makeup done together the day of and pick outfits and hair makeup for you that is within your style but slightly less attention gathering than hers.\n\n2. Tell her you\u2019re not doing frumpy but you will compromise and go with a simpler style as a one-time concession to her insecurities but it will not become a habit and any further requests of this sort will damage your friendship. Tell her she\u2019s a wonderful person and her insecurities are best resolved through counseling rather than using friends as props. Then choose an outfit/look that is much simpler than your normal style but which really suits you, and dial your charisma back a bit for the night. Bonus points if you bring a really hot date.\n\nIf you rate your friendship with Jamie a lot higher, then either:\n\n1. Figure out what will both make you comfortable and make his birthday drama free while you still attend part of it and do that for Jamie; or\n\n2. Dress wildly frumpy in a costume way and have fun with it. I dare you to wear a granny dress and bun or a flannel shirt and denim coveralls.  Or pull the old frumpy til partway through gag  where toward the end you say you\u2019re overheated and go to the bathroom and take off your fake glasses, let your beautiful hair down, and remove your frumpy outer layer to reveal a glamorous layer underneath.\n\nIf your own dignity is more important than either friendship, don\u2019t go. Telling Jamie why is optional.", "How is she almost 30 and this immature?! NTA. Don\u2019t miss your friend\u2019s birthday coz she\u2019s insecure", "NTA it sounds like she thinks Jamie is into you, which I have no idea if is the case or not but that won\u2019t be resolved by you changing your outfit for one event. Caving to this will lead to escalating demands. \nJust hold your line, as dispassionately as possible, that you\u2019re either going to an event where you\u2019re asked to have your outfit pre-approved for modesty. Especially where you\u2019ve been singled out for your personal style like this. If you\u2019re willing to go along with a universalised dress code, like if she wants full rights to the colour red or some bullshit like that, then let her know. And let her know that she always stands out regardless of what she wares. And ask her to be honest with her boyfriend since it\u2019s shitty to involve you in a lie like that.", "You should not bow to her insecurities, she needs to deal with that. You do you. NTA", "NTA, but have you considered going dressed up as Velma from Scooby Doo, and explaining your choice of outfit when asked. That should put the cat amongst the pigeons.", "NTA\n\nShe wants you to show up looking like crap so she can look better by comparison. This is beyond pathetic. You should really tell Jamie the truth since she is obviously going to spin this in a way that makes you look bad no matter what you do.", "NTA. Go to the party, dress as you like and carry on as normal. Kate is being immature and ridiculous. She needs to get over her insecurities and realise that Jamie has chosen her regardless of looks.", "NTA, your friend is just being immature, she should be celebrating your win for simply looking good when you make the effort, go to the party and dress up", "NTA. She sees you as competition but because Jaime wants you there, it has blown up in her face. You are taking the high road by not coming. Honestly, if Jaime was interested in you, it doesn't matter what you show up in. But if Kate persists with this dress code nonsense, you should tell her that you aren't going to lie to Jaime any more and will tell him the real reason why you are not coming. He should know what his GF is capable of", "NTA. Kate is asking you not to be yourself. She\u2019s clearly very insecure, but that\u2019s a her issue, not a you issue. I think you\u2019ve handled the situation well.", "NTA. \n\nThe reality is that there will always be more attractive people than Kate or anyone in the room or in the world. The thing Kate needs is to work on her self esteem. What if Jamie's friend shows up and is a super attractive woman? Is Kate going to flip her shit? What if Jamie's coworkers are also hot AF? When will Kate ever measure up? Because all that matters is what Jamie thinks and obviously 3 years in should be enough for Kate to be confident about his feelings for her. \n\nI will say it's odd that Kate hasn't met his friends and colleagues. And if she has, why she's feeling like she needs to be extra impressive. I personally feel like this is an excuse. She sounds like she's been insecure about Jamie and OP's relationship thus this ask. \n\nI think you were respectful in declining. Since Jamie wants you there and you're also friends beyond knowing him as Kate's boyfriend, you can tell him what's going on. You can say the reason you declined is due to Kate's ask. Say you understand she wants to make a good impression and be the apple of his eye but you found it incredibly rude and inappropriate to ask for outfit approval. Suggest that Jamie and Kate consider couples counseling since she seems to have major insecurities and that you hope he has a wonderful birthday party and that you can see him at the next sporting event. No drama, just honesty and still being respectful of Kate's feelings by not going.", "NTA\n\nYou're perfectly valid to stay away as it keeps your dignity and doesn't make your friend look bad.\n\nGoing frumpy would just not be right; it's Jamie's party, not Kate's, and it's humiliating and disrespectful to have your friend enforce a dress code like some kind of schoolteacher. My question is why does she get to set the dress code anyway?\n\nThe solution here seems to be that you are Kate get ready/plan your outfits together, but without compromising your look. Instead take her look up a notch. If she really wants to outshine you, she can do that by going even bolder. If she's not comfortable with that, then so be it.\n\nThe pro play here is to turn up anyway in your least frumpy outfit and let your friend be mad.", "NTA - She is insecure , tell the truth to Jamie", "NTA.", "NTA tell her to forth and multiply with themselves", "NTA. I think there are two better choices though, or you could damage your friendship with Jamie. Either turn up wearing whatever the hell you want to; or explain the dilemma to Jamie and ask for his advice.", "NTA just go in whatever you want to wear, nobody gets to control you like that", "NTA. Nor at all.", "NTA. Your friend is the one being immature, and knows it. The fact that she called you that, is gaslighting! I would seriously be reconsidering my friendship with such a jealous friend if I were you.", "Info: I know this is probably gonna sound bad but how good are you two looking compared to each other?", "ESH\n\nAs someone else mentioned, Jamie is the one who will miss out, and he won't understand why. You should let Kate know that you will be coming, you will be dressing the same way you always dress for these events, and that if she brings it up at all you'll let Jamie know why your attendance has been uncertain.", "YTA to Jamie for ditching his party because of her. My response would have been 'lol, don't be ridiculous, see you there'.", "ESH.\nShe shouldn't dictate what you wear.\nYou amd Jaime seem a bit too close and seems to care alot about your whereabouts.\n\nYes its not right of her to ask you such a thing but my god... Just do it. Your friend wants to shine for that one night so let her . Its not about you.\n\nShe needs to think on why Jaime would be distracted by you and I am wondering the same thing and hoe your interactions are with one another.", "Just wondering would the request be outrageous if it was their wedding?

It Jamie.  So the person that should shine is the bday person \n\n\nIt makes me think Kate is unsure of how Jamie feels about her. She's not confident that this relationship is going to last", "It\u2019s too weird. Only go if you wish to do her a solid. Her condition is ridiculous. So if you go it\u2019s only because you are doing a favor for a friend and I would make that clear if you attend.", "NTA. If it was such a big concern, why does she want you there so badly? So you can't wear what you want, but you absolutely have to show? Does Jamie talk about you at home or something? Maybe she overheard him talking to his friends about you. I truly can't think of a single other reason she wouldn't want you to \"steal the spotlight\"; but also, you *need* to be there.", "NTA.  But please rethink the friendship with Kate before she gets engaged and turns a Bridezilla.  If her insecurity is so high for a birthday party, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near her wedding party.", "NTA, tell everyone asking the truth (with receipts) so everyone can know that she\u2019s so I secure that she asked a guest and friend to dress frumpy because she thought the guest would be so much more attractive that no one would pay attention to her", "She\u2019s pushing 30 and acting like a child. NTA", "NTA. Send her a fake frumpy outfit to approve and show up dressed to the nines. She\u2019ll freak out and have a crappy night but won\u2019t be able to say anything without looking like a jerk. She\u2019ll give you crap afterwards but really, that\u2019s her problem. Smile and say yes and then do what you want.", "NTA, but tell him the truth.\n\nTell him you aren't booked.  That you aren't sure what is going on with Kate, but she asked you to dress 'frumpy' so as to not be a distraction at his party, and demanding your outfit be approved in order to attend.\n\nSo happy birthday, but its best you don't attend.", "Info:\nHow good a friend is she? \nWhat would she do for you?", "NTA", "NTA. I would oblige my friend in the most obnoxious way. Buy a mumu and some ridiculous flip flops.", "NTA. Screenshot your convo with Kate. Send it to Jamie. Tell him she lied to him about why you're not coming. Wish him a happy birthday. Sit back and watch.", "NTA.  Her insecurity is not your problem.  Find yourself some better friends.\n\n>could I just put my pride aside and come to the party. \n\nSnotty attempt at blame-shifting.  Fuck that.", "NTA. How is Kate so worried about him losing him after being with him for three years? OP should have told every woman at the party to dress to the nines. Kate could have had a fit, and Jamie would have probably not cared.", "Nta and i would tell him about it, she overstepped all the boundaries when she tried to put the blame on you for her insecurities", "NTA but I think there is definitely more going on here. Why does Kate feel insecure about you, specifically? Is it because you spend a lot of time with her BF platonically? Or is it because in the past, you've been the center-of-attention friend, the extrovert, and she's been happy to let you take the spotlight, but is asking you to tone it down this once? I think that you should absolutely put your foot down, its not ok for a friend to police what you look like because of their own insecurities. But if you are feeling generous to this person who you ostensibly like and want to help, talk to her and find out what exactly is making her anxious. It could be as simple as she's feeling insecure about her appearance, and you always look super amazing so she's freaking out a little bit. In that case you could help her pick out a fantastic outfit that makes her look and feel great. If its insecurity about your relationship with the BF, that needs a whole conversation. FWIW, I've had that conversation, my BFF met her hubby and we got along amazingly well. I didn't know she was upset the whole time because she thought we were flirting, when I legitimately have no romantic interest in him at all. That was almost 15 years ago and while it was an uncomfortable conversation, we cleared the air and are all still friends to this day.", "NTA, congrats on being the Harrison Bergeron of hotness I guess?", "NTA. I would ask her why she is wasting her time on a boyfriend who has no control over what woman he gives attention to at parties. I mean come on. It\u2019s 2023. We know men have control over their eyeballs and dicks.", "Send the gift and your regrets", "She's insecure in her relationship, and wants you to accommodate that.\n\n\nYour choice is, do you? Do you try to have an adult conversation about what all of it is really about?\n\nWho do you wanna be? What do you want to happen?", "NTA I'd tell him the reason.", "NTA at all in this situation. But, I do wonder if she'd appreciate your advice about what she's wearing? If she's insecure enough about what you might turn up in, maybe turn it back on her, and have a days shopping trip and getting ready together, maybe offer to help her choose her outfit? Offer to help her do her makeup and make sure she looks utterly amazing? \n\nI know that this is probably the last thing on your mind in this situation- she has no right to tell you how you should be dressing to a party unless there is a dress code for everyone, but maybe something like this might help her with those insecurities in a proactive way? Don't know if it would, but it might? \n\nI know for my friends helping each other to look utterly amazing is half the fun of going out. And it's something you do less as you get older. I've been envious of my friends abilities in choosing clothes/ doing their makeup before, but asking them for help and suggestions has fixed it completely. And they enjoyed playing 'dress up'. That way everyone looks brilliant, and you're becoming closer friends as well!", "NTA.\n\nI wonder if Jamie suspects Kate's jealousy and thinks that perhaps she SAID she invited you but actually left you off the list. Hence the text about being \"booked\".\n\nText Kate with a screenshot and say \"Do you want to tell him or shall I?\"", "NTA. \nYour friend is very insecure and obviously wants to be the center of attention. Just don\u2019t go to this birthday party.", "NTA. This is not a healthy situation. Your friend needs to work through some things with her bf. I\u2019d still clear of both of them till then.", "NTA but please fill the poor man in.\n\nWho knows what else she's lying to him about. Contraception. Other friends. Money. Possibilities are endless with Crazies", "NTA\nNobody NOBODY who calls you a friend should be policing your clothes to make you look \"frumpy\" to bolster themselves. It's absolutely ridiculous that somebody would think it was ok to basically ask somebody to put their personality aside so they can outshine them. It's going to cause huge issues but it might be worth telling Jamie AFTER his birthday that you did want to come and that Kate would be able to give him more information, I mean it would probably break them up but she's acting completely irrationally and frankly she needs a reality check. I always dressed up the most out of my friends and nobody ever asked anything like that from me.", "NTA. I would not feel comfortable being policed like that either, though I understand Kate feeling insecure and desperate to stand out. Maybe you can offer to lend Kate some clothes or help her get ready?", "NTA. Tell Jamie. He deserves to know. Either he\u2019s cool with it or not but you aren\u2019t helping anyone by hiding the truth. Then show up glammed for the gods.", "NTA, either tell him the real reason you declined the invite, or go and dress as you normally would. Just because your friend \"knows her request is ridiculous and desperate\" doesn't make it okay.", "NTA- id probably tell him that you and his gf had a disagreement and that\u2019s why you aren\u2019t coming and that she can tell him what happened.", "If I was you and feeling petty, I\u2019d probably [Marilyn Monroe](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2022/05/03/marilyn-monroe-potato-sack/amp/?prebid_ab=enabled) it; find something frumpy and make it gorgeous. \n\nNTA As a solid 4-6/10 I\u2019ve regularly had friends who were more attractive than I am and I can tell you that your friend\u2019s insecurities are not your responsibility. \n\nTry not to talk shit about her but stand your ground. It\u2019s okay to say the truth to Jamie - Kate wanted to set a dress code for you and you\u2019re not comfortable with it so you\u2019re passing on the event but look forward to seeing them soon. \n\nYou do not need to dim your light so others can shine and no one should as you to.\n\nEdit: If you think she\u2019s right and Jamie would give you more attention than he would give her you have a totally different problem on your hands", "Sounds like you are in the middle of couple trouble. She's jealous and he's probably feeding it. Step back and let them be NTA", "girl you are a grown ass woman, and so is she. That is highschool shit. Go to his party, and wear whatever u want. She is acting like a child.", "This is a ridiculous request and you are NTA. I would tell Jaime to ask Kate for the real reason you're not attending.", "NTA and I would already have told Jamie the truth. With screenshots if needed.", "NTA.  Some of the suggestions you have received are amusing to me. To be honest the best solution is really the one that utilizes the least amount of mental and emotional energy.\n\nDo you want to go to the party, yes or no? If yes make plans to go to the party and dress appropriately for the party.  Standard etiquette dictates that you do not outshine the host of said party.\n\nNow, any further text messages with obnoxious requests, deserve obnoxious responses.  I recommend, \"The outfit hasn't arrived yet.  But I can describe it.  A neon-pink fishnet, strapless, form fitting skirt with my favorite pair of 'f-me' pumps.  As I don't want any undergarments showing, I won't be wearing any.  Of course, you'll be getting a makeover that afternoon at Tarts-R-Us Salon.\"\n\nThe response will most likely go over like a fart in church. I would then inform your friend that any further obnoxious questionsrequests that she has will be met with even more obnoxious responses.\n\nHere's my legal disclaimer. This strategy is designed to get you to the party with, hopefully, a minimization of drama. This will not do anything for long-term survival of your friendship. But with my friend group, sometimes you have to be a little obnoxious before people get the idea that they're being obnoxious themselves. Good luck, have fun at the party.", "NTA unless you don\u2019t tell Jamie. Sorry Kate is a walking pyscho red flag. Don\u2019t come to our mutual friends party unless you dress down ugly so I can be in the spotlight even though it\u2019s not my party or day. Honestly her being his gf is irrelevant since he is your friend too. Y\u2019all met at the same time so her dating him doesn\u2019t trump your friendship. Katie is an insecure little girl who needs a reality check.", "Please tell Jamie", "Yep. Katie needs to grow up. She could call op and tell her she wants some help picking out an outfit to stand out, maybe some makeup tips.  Ask op to go shopping together, get some tips, but no.... she decided to ask op to dull her shine.", "If they really are friends, he should know that she has relationship insecurity.", "Yeah, i usually think sending screenshots of a conversation is a no-go, but in this case it seems like the only way to explain without having a bunch of she-said vs she-said drama.", "Meeting a dress code is not \"giving up bodily autonomy\". Melodramatic much?", "Exactly. OP should not be a part of this lie to Jamie. Be honest, OP. If she has nothing to be ashamed about, then she won\u2019t mind her boyfriend knowing.", "Is Kate such a good friend that it\u2019s worth losing another, though?", "It's not even that she thinks OP will dress skimpy. She wants OP to dress frumpy.", "I agree. Kate is being ridiculous, but I would guess this comes from a level of insecurity for how her bf likely fawns over OP. No friend would ever ask a friend to dim their shine unless they felt intimidated by it. That\u2019s obviously what\u2019s happening here. I would advise OP to have a tough but real conversation with Kate about the dynamic between the three of them", "> Does she think you\u2019re going to Don a low cut floozy dress like Scarlett O\u2019Hara at Ashley\u2019s birthday party?\n\nWhat if she did? I don't think it's appropriate for me to tell anyone the specifics of what they should and should not wear to a party. This is completely Kate's problem, not OP's. NTA all the way.", "Omg can you imagine how she will be as a bride!?!?!", "Or OP dresses inappropriately for birthday boy's work colleagues and they all (or all the girls) talk about it behind her back and not to her face.", "I love this post. Sounds like she was friends with Kate much longer than Jamie. They met him on a night out and he started dating the friend. But the friend is feeling insecure and really wants to be the second highlight of the night since his coworkers will be there. I can get the awkwardness if OP shows up looking like the \"the other woman in his life\". It would be showing up the bride at a wedding and could certainly cause whispers. But Jaime's desperation for OP to be there and Kate's need to be affirmed is really sus. If OP doesn't show up, would Jamie be truly bothered by that and if so why? I think your post is a great way to de-escalate all of this drama and then maybe the air can be cleared between Kate and OP while they shop.", "I like the 2nd option. It puts the onus on the insecure friend and she can come clean about the disagreement or dig a deeper hole. She clearly didn't give the whole story when telling the boyf why op wasn't coming so I think it's a nice subtle way to tell him there's more to the story without fully going scorched earth and sending screenshots of the texts. I think it's a much more diplomatic and classy way to handle it, at least.", "\"Sorry, your girlfriend told me that if I come over, you'll be lusting over me all night and ignoring her, and that makes me uncomfortable.

Wedding) and being asked to dress yourself to appease someone's insecurities. This isn't a party dress code since OP is being specifically targeted", "It is when it\u2019s being policed.  This isn\u2019t a fucking dress code.  It\u2019s an insecure woman policing what another woman can wear because of her own issues.  OP is 1000% correct in not going if this is the ultimatum.", "Dress code for ONE person because she's insecure and op has every right not to go.

She\u2019s upset that her boyfriend has a female friend. I\u2019d ditch Kate and still be friends with the normal, non-dramatic/demanding friend. Kate\u2019s the one not worth the drama- she\u2019s the one specifically creating the drama.\n\nOdds are op is just more conventionally attractive than Kate and she feels self conscious around her. This is unfortunate but this is Katie\u2019s issue that Kate needs to deal with- and not by policing another woman\u2019s physical appearance.\n\nNTA- Kate is self conscious, she is making you the competition and she is in her mind losing the competition so she\u2019s trying to even up the playing field. This is her game and you have no need to participate.\n\nbesides odds are even if you showed up in a potato sack or mumu odds are Jamie is still gonna talk to you and hang out with you and quite frankly you\u2019re probably still gonna come off as more attractive than her because a big part of attractiveness is in self confidence and no matter how much Kate wants to try to push the other women around her down and diminish them to make herself look better in comparison her jealousy and insecurities will still shine through.\n\nI\u2019m kinda torn on what you should tell Jamie cause on the one hand I truly feel he deserves to know the truth- that his girlfriend doesn\u2019t trust him around you and is asking his friend to tone herself down so she looks better- but I know any way you word it there\u2019ll be friends who will\nRead this as you trying to break them up and get your claws into Jamie because there\u2019s a lot of people who don\u2019t believe men and women can be friends and they (and Kate) will use this to make you out to be the bad guy even through she\u2019s 100% in the wrong here\u2026 so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- just use your best judgement so far as what you tell Jamie is concerned cause generally I think someone lying to their significant other, manipulating them and trying to interfere with their friendships is a major red flag but in this case telling the truth and being honest is likely gonna mean a hell of a lot more headaches for you.\n\nGood luck op.\n\n*edited to fix name- I conflated Kate and Jamie and ended up reading it as katie lol*", "I don't think she wants all male attention, she probably just wants Jamie's attention.
