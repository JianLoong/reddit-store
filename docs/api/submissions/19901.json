When I read the title if your post, I thought maybe you were thirteen and I was gonna sympathize and tell you to  bide your time till you grow up and can get out.\n\nBut, no, you are 26 and married.  Your mom can keep her opinions to herself or she can see a lot less of you and your wife. You can make that happen. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour mom sure is though. Really don\u2019t know why she thought that could possibly go over well.", "NTA. Your mother isn\u2019t doing this for your wife\u2019s benefit, she is doing it to feel superior to her. Unsolicited advice is never given to actually help people. If your mother were actually driven to help, she would have made the comment *once* at most and then let it lie, or, at the least backed off when told to. She played the \u201cI was a nurse\u201d card because she thinks it makes her better than the people around her. \n\nKudos to you for standing up to your mother for your wife. It is important that your mother knows that you will back your wife on this (and that your wife knows that you will back her). You are a good person!", "NTA\n\nYour mother is body shaming your wife.  You've made it known in the past that her input isn't welcome and she has continued making thinly veiled comments about her weight.", "NTA, You told your mom that you guys will handle it and she just kept pestering you about it, it was about time that you would snap. Your mom had no business being in your business", "NTA- Your mom should not be commenting on your wife\u2019s weight.", "NTA, you've tried to tell her before and it didn't get through, your outburst is understandable", "NTA --- Hasn't it been sort of proven that when you harass people about their weight it only makes them feel even worse about themselves and instead of motivating them it makes them eat even more?.", "NTA. Your mom has been rude as fuck, and your anger is justified. Good on you for stepping up and defending your wife.\n\nHowever, you may want to reflect on how the shouting match could have been avoided if you had drawn a very firm, clear boundary with your mother a lot earlier.\n\n*I tried brushing it off, telling her we have it handled, no worries...*\n\n*I told her straight up, don't worry about it.*\n\nThat was far too mild, and a person like your mom isn't going to take a blind bit of notice - as you discovered. From your mom's point of view, you went straight from zero to a hundred. Every time she brought up the subject, you said mildly \"don't worry... don't worry... don't worry...\" and then one day you yelled at her, with nothing in between.\n\nSo, stop saying that everything's fine. Stop reassuring her that you have it under control. Above all, stop using the word \"worry\". She thinks she has the *right* to worry. (She's wrong, of course, but you'll never convince her of that.) Let her worry all she likes! She can hold all the opinions she likes, provided she keeps them to herself!\n\n**What you should have said was \"Mom, I do not want to hear any comments about Camille's body, my body, or anyone's body. I am** ***not*** **going to have this discussion with you. Drop the subject, or I will leave.\"**\n\nAnd mean it. Walk out of the room. Hang up the phone.

Those words will have a lasting impact on her self esteem. Your mother is absolutely TA in this case. I\u2019m so blessed that my MIL is amazing. We live out of state so we don\u2019t see each other in person often. She doesn\u2019t have a filter, and often says things without thinking. Last time I saw her she said \u201cI see you\u2019ve been enjoying some home cooking there! Looks good on ya! Men like a big butt\u201d she complimented my weight gain. No one. And I mean NO ONE except one\u2019s doctor should be commenting about someone\u2019s weight/size. My advice would be to tell Camille as often as you can that she is gorgeous just the way she is. Hug her often - keep reminding her she\u2019s beautiful- her ego took a hard hit, and it\u2019s likely replaying in her head like a broken record. Hugs to her!", "Exactly.

Normally where there are in-law problems, the spouse (whose family it is - in this case OP) should deal with them.\n\nBut you're right, if OP isn't there and his mom starts in on OP's wife, she needs to use a version of the same script.\n\nBasically I see the problem as ineffective communication on OP's part in the earlier stages of this battle.\n\nWhat he **meant** was \"Mind your own business, Mom!\". But what he **said** was \"Don't worry\". Naturally, Mom continued to believe it **was** her business and that he wasn't taking the issue seriously enough.\n\nBizarrely (because she was unquestionably wrong to stick her nose in) I can see it from Mom's side here. When your mild-mannered and polite son never makes it clear where the boundary is, and then suddenly explodes with rage at you, you might well be puzzled!\n\nIf only people would say what they mean..."]}
