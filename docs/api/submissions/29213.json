Apparently not. A woman, Annie (f35) stopped me during our break and told me I had to stop being such a know-it-all because it\u2019s annoying and makes everyone feel bad and it\u2019s just an asshole move.\n\nI replied that if she knew the answer she could answer, I purposefully wait to give others a chance and she said that\u2019s not the point, The point is, I\u2019m being a show off.\n\nI tried to remove myself from the conversation and I guess she couldn\u2019t help herself because she added \u201cand stop doing that pretentious accent, just do the same as everyone else.\u201d (I\u2019m lucky because I have a very good ear for accents and cadence so by watching Argentinian telenovelas for months, I was able to pick up a really good accent).

Awkward pauses in lessons when the teacher has asked a question and no one answers, half the time out of disinterest, are *painful*. So I put my hand up a lot. Even sometimes when I wasn't 100% confident, I tended to speak more than everyone else as a result.

It sounds like you're trying to do enough, and worst case, the teacher is responsible for moderating the class if they ever thought your behavior is hindering the progress of others.  \nI personally never understood the problem with trying to have a proper accent in other languages. Yes, some people will never sound like a native, and at times you yourself will sound silly trying too hard, but it's also not wrong to aim for fluency. Plus, you have a more immersive experience than a lot of people because of all the telenovelas you consume, and mimicking is a huge part of learning languages. So it doesn't feel like you're doing it for the sake of sounding superior to others or anything.\n\nCongratulations on your hard work ! I'm a firm believer in television helping us with foreign languages :) As you see me, English is not my first language, and I absolutely have television to thank in huge part for being able to reply to you right now.

Learning anything new can be difficult. there are those that go into with an open mind, knowing that they won\u2019t know everything and focused on their own growth. And then there are those who compare their abilities with others and feel insecure as a result.\n\nI do not interpret arrogance from your approach. You are not stepping on anyone\u2019s toes. If they don\u2019t know the answer, that is not your fault, and as you said, you are giving them space to speak if they know the answer. \n\nAlso, trying to speak with the appropriate accent makes total sense. Trying to speak Spanish with an English accent means one isn\u2019t pronouncing the words correctly, and therefore will have some challenges with others understanding them. You are doing nothing wrong here. \n\nKeep at it and I hope your speaking abilities improve!", "NTA\n\nBy giving the others an opportunity to answer first, and then answering, you're doing the right thing. \n\nBut perhaps you're in the wrong class. It sounds like your Spanish is considerably better than that of your classmates, so perhaps you belong in an advanced class.

As long as you have been giving other people an opportunity to participate then there's nothing wrong with answering or with speaking with the proper accent for that language. The only way you would be in the wrong is when you give your answer if you are saying it in a snarky know it all tone of voice, which I seriously doubt that you are! \n\nSo, don't worry about anybody's opinions of you accept the teacher. She's the one that gives the grades after all!", "NTA. But this may not be the right class for you. Since you strictly want to practice speaking try joining a conversation group", "NTA. The teacher will self correct if needed. They can ask you not to answer. Since they are calling on you now they think you\u2019re being appropriate.", "NTA - you learn Spanish by speaking it, you shouldn\u2019t prevent your own learning to please others. If Annie wants to answer questions asked in class, she can do some independent studying and answer as well.\n\nI\u2019ve always been the type to learn by speaking in class, I used to avoid answering even if I knew the answer when I was younger because I didn\u2019t want to come across as a know-it-all, but now I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m there to learn, and learn I will. As long as other people also get a chance to answer, you\u2019re good. \n\nTheir chance to learn shouldn\u2019t be ruined by you, but your chance to learn shouldn\u2019t be ruined by them either.", "NTA   Why in the world would you have to pretend anything so \"others\" in the class don't feel dumb?  You are in an intermediate class, doing the work, and extra beyond that.  Maybe you should ask the teacher if there is an \"advanced intermediate\" class which could be a better fit for you.", "NTA. As someone who's taught more beginning/intermediate math classes at the college level, it's an absolute drag begging people to answer a question you address to the class.

But maybe a little bit for telling her never to talk to you again.\n\nI disagree with another respondent; the accent imitation is perfectly OK. That's how you acquire the correct accent rather than sounding like a gringa.", "NTA, You should try with some Chilean Spanish if you want a real challenge, also keep in mind that Argentinians pronounce some letters in a weird way.", "[deleted]", "NTA, in middle/highschool, there were some required beginner's Spanish classes, and only me and the Spanish teacher's son had previous experience. We did the exact same thing of waiting to see if anyone else could answer. Instead of being nasty and jealous about it, my classmates would butter me up with compliments and ask for help on assignments haha. Since I was 5, I started learning Spanish with classes that were often half native speakers, so I also have an accent even though I'm white like a vanilla sundae. I was certainly never called pretentious for it. I wouldn't listen to her.", "NTA. \n\nAnnie missed a chance to make a friend. \n\nI'll explain. \n\nMy freshman year of college, spring semester. I took Spanish 104. It wasn't quite beginner level, but wasn't quite intermediate either. I just needed an easy A for that semester to balance out some of the harder shit I was doing. \n\nI'd been taking Spanish for 8 years by then, since 6th grade. The 104 class was close to my 8th grade classes. \n\nA girl started sorting next to me because she thought I was a know it all, but also thought I'd be easy to cheat off of. But if you sit next to me I'm going to talk to you... \n\nWe've been friends for 20+ years now. I don't actually know if she cheated off me, as I only found out about her motivations after we graduated.", "Yes, you're the asshole here. It's not about waiting a few seconds to give others a chance; it's about your attitude. You come across as arrogant and condescending. Annie was right to call you out. Instead of being humble and supportive in a learning environment, you're flaunting your knowledge and accent, making others feel inferior. It's not about jealousy; it's about common decency and respect for your classmates.", "NTA. Waiting to give people a chance to answer as you're already doing is the way to go, and it's not your fault Anne sees it as a source of insecurity instead of a chance to learn. As for the accent, I feel jealous too of who have a good English accent, but it's just a \u201cOh man wish that were me\u201d kinda thing? Helps me keep working to know others got there.\n\nYou're good, OP. Keep going as you are, teachers love it when students answer.

I came into class having already read the book, analyzed and discussed the theme, and so on. So when discussions were veering off course and or no one could come up with the answers my teacher wanted, he would ask me questions to help him get things back on track.\n\nTeachers use back-and-forth conversation with their students to keep the class interesting.

You are there to learn and improve your fluency. In order to do this, you have to actually speak. Annie should try answering a few of those questions herself.\n\nOne thing I would suggest though, is that your teacher is probably using a Mexican accent in the US and you are using an Argentinian one, which is quite different. There is also their different word for \"you\". Instead of saying \"T\u00fa sabes\", they say \"vos sab\u00e9s\" with the accent on a different syllable.

Meanwhile I have a friend who is fully proficient with 11 years of formal Mandarin education. But she still speaks Mandarin with a strong non-native accent, despite being leaps more fluent than me.

I'm not sure Annie understands why you would go to adult classes, if she thinks it not about learning and improving.
