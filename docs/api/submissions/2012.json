I don't want to dismiss these alleged experiences she has talked about, but I can only really take them with a grain of salt because she speaks very vaguely about it, giving little to no detail about specific instances.\n\nI have compassion for what Mig is going through mentally, but it has also caused her to behave in aggressive ways, that I cannot excuse regardless of her past traumas.\n\nThe last time I visited Mig's house, she became very angry during an innocuous conversation about what I was doing with family during spring break. She was screaming at me, VERY close to my face, with profanities and insulting words non-stop for almost 30 minutes.\nShe kicked me out in the end and blocked my number. I had zero contact with her for at least 6 months.\n\nWe eventually reconnected via text message, but she made it very clear that we would not be meeting in person again until we were both ready to sit down and have an open conversation. She suggested that we could do it at her house with her partner's participation. I'm honestly not comfortable going to her home because if I need to leave the situation, it will be very difficult to do so quickly. \n\nI suggested an alternative way to have the conversation: in simple terms, I offered to speak with my therapist and see if they could schedule an appointment for myself, Mig and her partner to come into the therapy office for the conversation.\n\nAs soon as I made it clear that I would not be able to have the conversation without someone else being with me, Mig shut down the entire idea and refused to even consider any compromise. She then proceeded to say that her life is much better without me, that I'm a bully/toxic/selfish/awful/controlling, and blocked my number.\n\nAm I wrong for having the expectation of being accompanied by another person?

The fact she's not willing to talk with a neutral third party present says volumes about her \"open conversation\".", "NTA.  She was going to have someone else there.  Why wouldn't you?  Sounds like they were getting ready to gang up on you.", "NTA !!!\n\nI suppose that (assuming Mig even \\*has\\* her own therapist) you could have offered to meet with her therapist instead of yours, but that is entirely beside the point. \n\nThe point is that you are never an asshole for setting boundaries to protect your physical safety.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not go to her home at all - it will be difficult to escape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you agree to talk to her at all, do it in a public setting where you can easily escape and end the discussion - and take a friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: What is there for YOU to discuss with her: YOu were not involved, you do not know what happened, you do not know which side to believe - STAY OUT OF IT: Stay away from the drama, it does not concern you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I offered to speak with my therapist and see if they could schedule an appointment for myself, Mig and her partner to come into the therapy office for the conversation.\" ..

STAY AWAY FROM HER!**", "NTA. she honestly sounds like a bully and i wouldn't feel comfortable either. the fact that she doesn't want another person in there feels like she doesn't want anyone to intervene when she gets nasty with you.", "NTA. You are trying to protect yourself and she\u2019s making it clear that a repeat of the precious instance would happen. Good job on your part for trying to make things work.", "NTA. Absolutely not. Proud of you for setting and sticking to boundaries. \nJust for arguments sake, even if the previous altercation had been two sided aggressive, it is still absolutely well within reason that you have someone on your side to support and mediate on your behalf. Her husband is on her side and while a 3rd party is a good idea, it should be a neutral party. I think the therapist idea is the best option and very mature of you to be willing to host them during your scheduled visit in order to come to a reconciliation.", "NTA.  Mig needs to have her \"open\" conversations with a therapist.", "NTA.\n\nYou offered a reasonable compromise, and if she's not going to agree with that, it was obvious she was never going to consider your feelings in the first place anyways, and only cared about hers.", "NTA. Your sister should go to a therapist, not take her anger out on you.", "NTA.  I see from your comments that your sister has not sought professional therapy or help.  This doesn\u2019t go away on its own.  Stand firm on your boundaries and it\u2019s best to probably have minimal to no contact with her as she sees a bit unsafe and volatile to be around without any real warning.  Don\u2019t risk your safety.  She doesn\u2019t want to have a conversation.  SHE wants to talk and she doesn\u2019t want open dialogue.  It will never serve you any benefit until she has sought intense therapy.", "NTA. Sounds like she was up to no good. Wanted to berate and abuse you herself, which would be hard to do if you had someone in your corner.", "NTA and your instincts are good. You offering your therapist - someone neutral and safe - was an excellent choice.", "NTA\n\nIf you feel unsafe I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have someone else there. If she is allowed her partner, why can\u2019t you have a person choice there? All seems a bit suspect to me", "NTA. You are exactly right in setting up boundaries, trying to meet in a neutral place, and having a nonbiased professional involved. Meeting on her terms puts her at a position of superiority.", "NTA. Your boundary is reasonable. Your sister is not. I had to cut my sister loose. She's toxic. It's sad, but not much we can do about it.", "NTA, I cannot think of any better mediator for a good conversation than a therapist.", "NTA, OP do not subject yourself to people like this. Your sister sounds like a manipulator and she shut down because the offer to reconcile was fake. It was just an opportunity to gaslight you and make you believe that you have been the cause of your strained relationship. She got angry bc you wanted a neutral spot with a neutral third party who wouldn't be swayed by her theatrics. And now she's got you so confused you forgot she was the one who hurt you. You're doing her a favor, she's supposed to be apologizing to YOU!!! Instead she's weaponizing her relationship with you to get what she wants. She's hoping you'll agree to whatever just to keep the peace, does this sound like someone who will ever apologize for their mistakes or even their part in the problem? Let her reach out when she's ready and stay firm on your boundaries. Good luck OP", "NTA\n\nYour sister is not well mentally.  It\u2019s all so conspiratorial.  I\u2019m completely with you about not going to her place, and even for just not having the conversation at all.\n\nWhatever happened to her, it was before you were born.  Your relationship with your mother is your own, based on your life with her.  Don\u2019t let your sister spoil that relationship by dragging you into her drama.", "INFO: what was that innocuous comment that you made? Does she know you don\u2019t believe her about your mother\u2019s abuse towards her?", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t want there to be a neutral party that would call her out on her bs. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nThat was a very wise boundary as I don't know what her mental illness is, but whatever it is you are not safe around her.  Be grateful for the NC that she's initiating.", "Nta you offered a good and fair option. Neutral mediator on neutral ground. \n\nShe wants home territory with her spouse. Thats 2 people vs 1. Thats tilted as all get out. \n\nShe sounds exitable and angry so a quick exit strategy is vital.", "NTA It\u2019s a power play. I recently had something similar and said I\u2019d only attend if my husband was present, I was then Gas lit for weeks about it and the person lied about the meeting and used it to speak badly about me to my parents.  If he hadn\u2019t been there I\u2019d have no proof that this person was lying and actually pretty toxic.\n\nKeep yourself safe!", "This is not about anyone being an A. Your sister probably has to fight with the results of an abusive childhood. You doubt that it did even happen, because she hasn't given you exact examples. (Could be easily a result of dissociation).\n\nSo in this cases it is quite often a good idea to stop having contact with the abuser, and mostly having contact with the part of the family that stands with the abuser and are conceived as possible harmful. Since you don't really believe her you would probably belong to this part of the family. But it seems that she still wanted to try contact. The last contact was not good for either of you: sounds as if she went into fight - mode (a trauma response) and later  \n\n>She kicked me out in the end and blocked my number. I had zero contact with her for at least 6 months. \n\nYou describe this, and that she talked 30 minutes, but you don't mention why she was do upset - even tho that is probably the most important part for her (the missing missing reason) \n\n\nThen you reconnected (who started?). But she doesn't feel safe. And so she makes it clear that she would need a talk with you in a safe surrounding, that is something that trauma survivors are advised to do if they do want the contact. \n\n\nSo at this point you can agree, or you can say you don't want to. Maybe it is better to just leave it at texts, or maybe contact isn't such a good idea at this point. But this seems to be about her trying to find a way to still have contact with you at all, and not about a talk that will have to take place and you just have to decide on the conditions. \n\nSo make up your mind what you can do, and let her make up her mind what she needs. And then see if there there is a Intersection. And if it isn't, if her way is the only way she can handle it, and this is not a way you want to do it, than accept that and both of you decide if you want to stay in contact via text or get out of contact. \n\nFamily contact is not a right and not a given, and for someone probably fighting cptsd the healing should be way more important than keeping contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If this is her trying to.make things works, I don't want to see how she is when she is really fighting with you.\n\nWe can't really know I she was really abused or not, but you were not her abuser and ahe has no right to take it on you. Also if she is not capable to deal her issues with a therapist is her problem, not yours.", "NTA.  The fact that she refuses to meet on neutral ground and wants her partner there but wants you to be alone tells me she wants to gang up on you and frankly her blow up at you was abusive.  Talk to your own therapist about setting healthy boundaries with your sister and possibly going low contact.  Never go over to your sister's home alone and try to keep to communal spaces when you do have to see her.  Frankly I find a 34 year old screaming at a 19 year old for half an hour rather disturbing", "NTA your sister is a damn adult trying to isolate and gang up on you. yeah sure the partner CoUlD be somewhat reasonable but thats not a risk you should take. she is the bully here. stand your ground and do not go to her house", "Nta it\u2019s a trap to let her play the victim. Only witness will be her partner? No thanks. Don\u2019t take her calls either unless you have permission to record them or live where you don\u2019t have permission. Document ever call and keep every text. If her mental state continues to become worse you will need evidence to get a restraining order.", "NTA, she could have been abused but now she has become abusive.  Both can be true.  You have no obligation to enable her regardless of her past, which you had no part in.", "she doesn't have a therapist unfortunately... she's definitely massively in denial of the fact that she is part of the problem when it comes to her interpersonal functioning", "Yeah, especially since Mig gets to have her partner there while insisting the OP be on her own.\n\nOP NTA \n\nEdit: removed a remark that OP answered further down", "we literally were just chatting about what i had been doing during spring break. i casually told her about going to a mall event with my parents, showed her what i bought at the mall, told her about the recent time i'd hung out with one of my other sisters and painted her nails... just normal \"what you've been up to lately\" conversation. and no, i don't tell her that thing about our mom because it would only be a one-way ticket to a massive argument. i wanted to keep the peace with her.", "the reason i brought up the allegations of abuse is because she constantly uses that as her reasoning for her verbal aggression and hostility. the alleged events happened long before i was even born, so although i don't want to be completely dismissive, there's literally nothing to go off of other than her own word. i cannot fully believe allegations that i had no way to witness and can only really take it with a grain of salt.\n\nmore so, she is currently unable to comprehend a very important fact: trauma and mental health issues do not give her a free pass to hurt and belittle others. regardless of the allegations being true or false or her struggling with CPTSD, there is no excuse for her to behave in ways that cause others suffering or distress.\n\nthe list of shit she has done goes well beyond what i was able to fit within this sub's 2,000 character limit. i tried extremely hard to be compassionate and empathetic for her psychological difficulties, but it really seemed like nothing was good enough unless i blindly believed and validated every word she ever said to me.\n\nquite frankly, i don't really want to have contact with her again either. if she truly feels traumatized by her childhood and is dealing with PTSD, she needs to get her shit together by going into therapy and dealing with it that way, instead of projecting it onto people who have no clue what to even say to her. unfortunately it seems an awful lot like she wants to continue wallowing in her misery and portraying herself as a perpetual victim instead of making any effort to actually do anything about it.\n\nshe's a 34 year old grown woman who is deeply in denial about the mess she's made. she honestly just needs professional help... a lot of it.", "yeah i figured that was probably too much to hope for, but like i said it doesn't matter. you did absolutely the right thing OP. and im sorry you're dealing with this. What an awful situation", "definitely sounds like they were going to gang up on OP", "WOW, never go, It could end like Tammy Homolka", "You absolutely did the right thing considering what she did to you last time. No question about it. She's still abusing you and that's not okay even if she was abused herself as a child.", "NTA.\n\nMy mother was abusive. I left when I was 15 to get away from her. She was, however, a wonderful mother (by all accounts) to my half-sister, who was very young when I left. I've been NC with my mother for years now.\n\nI'm LC with my sister, because she is still very close to my mother, and it just hurts. I have never screamed at my sister. I've never expected her to take on my pain. I've never tried to punish her for having what I never did.\n\nI'm glad one of us got a good childhood.", "NTA - I had a friend who went to a therapist who specialized in hidden memories.  Like women therapist said suppressed abuse/assaults and this therapist would help them bring these memories out of the vault in the patients mind so they could fix their lives.  I think this therapist was a sham, and was able to make the patient believe things that never happened.   Makes me wonder if OP's sister met a similar therapist.  Sister won't go to a true therapist because it might come out that she really wasn't abused or thinks she was because Mom was being a parent and not letting her get away with stuff.    How many teens have yelled \"I HATE YOU\" to the parent that won't let them go to a party where there is going to be booze and drugs.  Or maybe Mom kept sister from getting into a relationship with someone unsuitable, like a married man or someone who was much older than sister.", "She sounds controlling and unreasonable. NTA. She may be lying to control you further but you\u2019ll never know however, she\u2019s treated you in an abusive way, so your better off without her. The only relationship she wants is entirely on her terms but that\u2019s a dictatorship", "NTA, not only does she want the home field advantage, she wants to have back up there. It doesn't sound like she wants to actually repair this relationship, she just wants to have the power and yell at you again. It sounds like you should block her on your end.\n\nNo your expectation is not wrong, and know your boundary is not unreasonable, you just have to accept that she doesn't actually want to repair this relationship", "Sister was setting you up. You know and I, both know it. Since she has already shown no regard towards you in anyway, do not trust her. \n\nConsider it the best gift sister has ever gave you, peace of mind. Especially with her blocking you. NTA", "NTA. It sounds to me as though she wants to gang up on you with her partner. If you are going to meet her at all, you absolutely need a neutral location and a friend with you.", "Never meet her alone.  If she was this aggressive there\u2019s no guarantee she won\u2019t get violent.  I would say she\u2019s jealous of you.  She\u2019s what,  14/15 years older than you.  If there are no siblings between you burst her princess bubble.  Meet in public or just block her - I don\u2019t believe you can win with her.", "You are setting healthy boundaries and ensuring your safety and security... definitely NTA. Also, kudos for having such insight at 19 years old! It will serve you well", "This is helpful to know but honestly it is almost irrelevant. You\u2019re only 19 now so I assume you were 18 when that happened. And younger in past interactions. No 30+ adult should scream at a teenager like that. I think it is safe and healthy to present the options you did for the conversation, and her reaction is very telling.", "I think going NC will be great for both of your mental health. I can only imagine her idea of open conversation is her screaming at you with profanities while her partner watching on.", "She wanted to be able to do exactly what she wants like screaming in your face, with another person present she can't, stay away from her she needs to heal here own issues", "NTA, Mig is unreasonable.", "NTA -  therapy session after last time was reasonable. Sorry nc with her until she can behave like an adult.", "NTA, and I say this as the eldest who was abused and my younger siblings will never understand bc they were not treated the same. Your sister needs help, and I mean professional help. At this point it might be best to stay no contact because unless she is willing to change you will always be the bad guy.", "Won't talk with a neutral party present AND wants her partner to be there to back her up. Sounds like an awful time for OP"]}
