Proud of you for setting and sticking to boundaries. \nJust for arguments sake, even if the previous altercation had been two sided aggressive, it is still absolutely well within reason that you have someone on your side to support and mediate on your behalf.

Your sister should go to a therapist, not take her anger out on you.", "NTA.  I see from your comments that your sister has not sought professional therapy or help.  This doesn\u2019t go away on its own.  Stand firm on your boundaries and it\u2019s best to probably have minimal to no contact with her as she sees a bit unsafe and volatile to be around without any real warning.

It's sad, but not much we can do about it.", "NTA, I cannot think of any better mediator for a good conversation than a therapist.", "NTA, OP do not subject yourself to people like this. Your sister sounds like a manipulator and she shut down because the offer to reconcile was fake. It was just an opportunity to gaslight you and make you believe that you have been the cause of your strained relationship. She got angry bc you wanted a neutral spot with a neutral third party who wouldn't be swayed by her theatrics. And now she's got you so confused you forgot she was the one who hurt you. You're doing her a favor, she's supposed to be apologizing to YOU!!! Instead she's weaponizing her relationship with you to get what she wants. She's hoping you'll agree to whatever just to keep the peace, does this sound like someone who will ever apologize for their mistakes or even their part in the problem? Let her reach out when she's ready and stay firm on your boundaries. Good luck OP", "NTA\n\nYour sister is not well mentally.  It\u2019s all so conspiratorial.  I\u2019m completely with you about not going to her place, and even for just not having the conversation at all.\n\nWhatever happened to her, it was before you were born.  Your relationship with your mother is your own, based on your life with her.  Don\u2019t let your sister spoil that relationship by dragging you into her drama.", "INFO: what was that innocuous comment that you made? Does she know you don\u2019t believe her about your mother\u2019s abuse towards her?", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t want there to be a neutral party that would call her out on her bs. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nThat was a very wise boundary as I don't know what her mental illness is, but whatever it is you are not safe around her.  Be grateful for the NC that she's initiating.", "Nta you offered a good and fair option. Neutral mediator on neutral ground. \n\nShe wants home territory with her spouse. Thats 2 people vs 1. Thats tilted as all get out. \n\nShe sounds exitable and angry so a quick exit strategy is vital.", "NTA It\u2019s a power play. I recently had something similar and said I\u2019d only attend if my husband was present, I was then Gas lit for weeks about it and the person lied about the meeting and used it to speak badly about me to my parents.  If he hadn\u2019t been there I\u2019d have no proof that this person was lying and actually pretty toxic.\n\nKeep yourself safe!", "This is not about anyone being an A. Your sister probably has to fight with the results of an abusive childhood. You doubt that it did even happen, because she hasn't given you exact examples. (Could be easily a result of dissociation).\n\nSo in this cases it is quite often a good idea to stop having contact with the abuser, and mostly having contact with the part of the family that stands with the abuser and are conceived as possible harmful. Since you don't really believe her you would probably belong to this part of the family. But it seems that she still wanted to try contact. The last contact was not good for either of you: sounds as if she went into fight - mode (a trauma response) and later  \n\n>She kicked me out in the end and blocked my number. I had zero contact with her for at least 6 months. \n\nYou describe this, and that she talked 30 minutes, but you don't mention why she was do upset - even tho that is probably the most important part for her (the missing missing reason) \n\n\nThen you reconnected (who started?). But she doesn't feel safe. And so she makes it clear that she would need a talk with you in a safe surrounding, that is something that trauma survivors are advised to do if they do want the contact. \n\n\nSo at this point you can agree, or you can say you don't want to. Maybe it is better to just leave it at texts, or maybe contact isn't such a good idea at this point. But this seems to be about her trying to find a way to still have contact with you at all, and not about a talk that will have to take place and you just have to decide on the conditions. \n\nSo make up your mind what you can do, and let her make up her mind what she needs. And then see if there there is a Intersection. And if it isn't, if her way is the only way she can handle it, and this is not a way you want to do it, than accept that and both of you decide if you want to stay in contact via text or get out of contact. \n\nFamily contact is not a right and not a given, and for someone probably fighting cptsd the healing should be way more important than keeping contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like women therapist said suppressed abuse/assaults and this therapist would help them bring these memories out of the vault in the patients mind so they could fix their lives.  I think this therapist was a sham, and was able to make the patient believe things that never happened.   Makes me wonder if OP's sister met a similar therapist.  Sister won't go to a true therapist because it might come out that she really wasn't abused or thinks she was because Mom was being a parent and not letting her get away with stuff.    How many teens have yelled \"I HATE YOU\" to the parent that won't let them go to a party where there is going to be booze and drugs.

The only alternative would be to have a conversation in a public space such as a coffee shop. NTA a million times. The fact that this angers her is proof she wants to have you cornered again. Having her partner there would not be enough, you need your own advocate.", "INFO: what specifics do you know about the abuse? What *exactly* precipitated her screaming in your face? I think that meeting with a therapist is a great idea so it's not cool for her to turn that down in this context, but I feel like this might be an \"esh\" situation; I'm having a hard time getting past you doubting her claims of abuse which is something that can definitely set off an abuse victim", "NTA", "NTA - What you suggested was a very smart compromise and it sounds like your sister is mentally not well and if for your mental health that means you don't have contact with her, I don't think this is a bad thing. \n\nWhat she did before was not ok, getting up in someone's face is very threatening and must have been very uncomfortable to endure", "NTA.  Mig is abusive in her actions to you.  There are zero reasons for you to be subjected to that again.  The first time, it was a surprise.  Don't let there be a second time.  Write her a text, stating that you don't feel safe in her presence after her incredibly aggressive actions towards you in your last meeting.  Tell her that you will always love her, but you need to not have contact with her again.  Block her everywhere and move on.  She isn't a healthy person for you to be involved with.  It sucks, but be aware of your safety first.", "Ding Ding Ding, that\u2019s what I was thinking as well, though it doesn\u2019t excuse or explain her behavior.", "i have been diagnosed with BPD myself and even i don't go around verbally abusing people over stupid shit/taking my personal troubles out on those around me. i really don't have much sympathy left for her.", "the only specifics i know of is that my mom allegedly broke into her diary she had as a teenager and punished her for what she wrote in the diary. i have asked my mom for her side of the story, and she explained that she did in fact open the diary after my sister had suddenly disappeared from home for multiple days. allegedly, my sister had been out getting into strip clubs as an underage teen, drinking and doing other substances, and going into hotel rooms with older men, and then verbally attacked my mom relentlessly when she got caught. allegedly.\n\nas for the immediate circumstances leading up to when she screamed in my face, we literally were just chatting about what i had been doing during spring break. i casually told her about going to a mall event with my parents, showed her what i bought at the mall, told her about the recent time i'd hung out with one of my other sisters and painted her nails... just normal \"what you've been up to lately\" conversation.", "We don\u2019t even know if the allegations are true or not, she has the right to not see op/ op family/ the abuser. What she has not right to do is to dictate to meet op in her house alone with her partner after having been violent to op.\n\nOp suggested a therapist, that is a neutral and safe space with a professional, where she could have bring the partner. It would be unsafe for op to meet her differently.", "And not to mention the age/maturity imbalance.", "that's it? just that? how could anyone get mad at that? NTA. your sister seems very toxic.", "I agree, that\u2019s why I\u2019m no contact with my own sister. One of my most sweetest friends also has BPD and has never ever been like that towards me.", "Since OP was a small child when her sister was OPs age, I wonder if the sister missed out on things like going to the mall with their parents because OP was too young to participate or they didn't have the money so sister is raging out of jealousy.", "NTA Last time she was abusive and could potentially get dangerous. AND she wants to have someone on her side during the discussions but force you to be alone. Big red flag.", "NTA - her over the top reaction to your perfectly reasonable suggestion is proof that your instincts were correct.", "Nta\n\nShe's prone to violent outbursts, your safety outweighs her whatever reason, the fact that she is refusing something that's there for your safety shows that she only thinks about herself, and would have most likely expected you to apologize while she claimed she never did anything wrong.", "NTA. Mug refused what could have been a safe, therapeutic alternative. Bullet dodged OP. Stick to your boundaries if it comes up again.", "NTA\n\n> She was screaming at me, VERY close to my face, with profanities and insulting words non-stop for almost 30 minutes.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to be the target of that kind of rage again either, especially alone.\n\nThat she was abused by your mother and you weren\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to abuse you.", "NTA\n\nIt honestly seems like you're sister is bipolar. A lot of what you mention about her behavior is very similar to my sister's. My sister is a pathological liar and has also told many 'stories' of assault that has changed as the years gone by, and goes through extreme emotional changes. In general her memory is usual flawed and her perception of the world is tainted by her inability to determine what was a real memory and what was a lie she didn't realize she told. When she's medicated and doing well she's a pretty good person, when life is stressful for her or she forgets her meds she's almost unbearable. \n\nI wish you luck in navigating this and finding your own peace.", "This is so lop-sided that I'm going with NTA, but don't you think it was a bad idea to tell her what you did with your parents when she thinks (rightly or wrongly) that one of them was her abuser? Nothing excuses the way she treated you, but I would not exactly call that an innocuous conversation since it involved your mom who she blames for all her problems.", "OP, NTA and good riddance for now. Whatever Mig is going through, she is choosing to do it alone. Less stress for you and less screaming in your face.", "She sounds like a bully.", ">you are actually Mig's daughter, not her sister.\n\nThat was exactly where my mind went as soon as read the age gap. \n\n>Perhaps she threw her out but took you in.\n\nMig may believe that OP's mom stole her child (which may be right,we don't have enough info) or may feel betrayed by OP getting a version of her parents she didn't get,which is why she takes it out on OP,even when they don't deserve it. \n\nWhatever it maybe,OP is NTA.", "i only mentioned my parents in passing while explaining what i had been up to. it was an innocuous conversation because i didn't fixate on my parents specifically, i was having a normal casual conversation with her and she lost her shit when i merely acknowledged the existence of my parents. i understand that people have certain triggers BUT it's ultimately not my responsibility to walk on eggshells for her sole protection. having to be walking on eggshells around her gives me massive anxiety and that is never okay. she is unwilling to get the help she needs for emotional regulation and trigger management, which makes it even less of my problem.\n\nalso, if it was truly unbearable for her to hear the word \"mum\" during that casual conversation, she could have simply POLITELY asked me to refrain from it or to change the subject. i would have obliged because i genuinely wanted to keep the peace with her, but she instead chose to start raising her voice and that lead to a big escalation.", "She screams in your face and accuses you of being abusive, wth?", "My sister beat me up because I put a cigarette out in an ashtray at her apartment. Angry people don't need real reasons to be angry.", "omg???? i'm so sorry that happened to you", "Thank you. It was a long time ago but the memory is still there. The best revenge is a life llived differently. I went NC and was better for it. Maybe OP should visit that option."]}
