I say this as a person who has an inherited ring that cannot be resized so I never wear it. However, there are ring guards you can add that will make it fit tighter on your finger. You can also wear a ring in front of the family heirloom that fits better to make sure the heirloom one doesn't fall off. I think in this case, you just didn't take the measures to insure its safety. The fact that you were being cautious is actually very respectful. Hopefully, you can make amends and wear it the next family outing with one of these counter measures.", "Oof, OP, this has been fun.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is you need to 1) talk to your Fianc\u00e9 about the ring 2) resolve the issue that\u2019s preventing you wearing the ring (if you want to wear it at all), and 3) (referring back to 1) work on your communication with your future partner.  \n\nYou should have worn the ring in some capacity; you said you would. In terms of a life-long commitment with someone, this was an easily avoidable issue/argument. While I think you should be able to wear and accessorize however One feels comfortable, this really never should have been an issue to begin with.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t like/want the ring, you should find a way to give it back to him/his family, so someone can wear/appreciate it proudly.

How hard is it to say \"Hey honey, I know you wanted me to wear the ring today but I'm really scared about loosing it.\" Or you know, after almost loosing it the first time, \"I wore the ring today and I almost lost it because of such and such reason.\" Starting a conversation about almost loosing it would've either led to them agreeing to not wear it out at all or problem solving so it doesn't happen again. Like another comment said, she could've worn it on a necklace. She obviously didn't think of this, but maybe they would've come to that idea together if she had started that discussion.\n\nIt shows that she didn't care enough to discuss the problem with him, that's what marriage is all about. Sharing your worries and solving problems together. If she did care, but didn't bring up this problem for another reason then there is some other problem going on in the marriage, but I see three times where OP could've started this discussion and avoided this outcome.\n\n1. When he first gave her the ring and told her it's an heirloom, very important, and would like it to be worn to special occasions. OP could've asked why, what's the history of the ring, the significance to his family. The fact that she so easily made the decision to not wear it, not tell him she changed her mind, and being surprised by his family's reaction shows that information was never discussed. Did she just say ok when he gave her the ring? Perhaps. \n\n2. After almost loosing it. She didn't tell her husband she almost lost an important piece of jewelry. Was she scared he was going to blame her? Then that could be a different issue in their marriage, but OP didn't say that so we can't know. She knew she would be expected to wear the ring again, since we do have more than one special occasion we go to in our lives. What did she expect would happen in the future? How is her husband to know she almost lost it if she doesn't say it?\n\n3. When OP decided not to wear the ring. This is where I would say she's an AH. There was clear communication beforehand when her husband asked her to wear the ring and SHE AGREED. He was operating under the knowledge and her confirmation that she was indeed wearing the ring. She can do whatever she wants, she can decide to wear it or not. It's her finger at the end of the day and ultimately her ring. However, could she not have let him know she had changed her mind and she's not wearing the ring? It's the fact that he specifically had asked her to wear the ring for this occasion. It would be a different story if he hadn't asked her to wear it, and had gotten upset because of that one time he asked her to wear it on special occasions when he gave it to her. To some degree she knew it was important to him for her to wear the ring, and had said yes. By letting him know they could've discussed this, and at least prepare themselves for the family's reaction. At the end of the day she had done a disservice to herself. \n\nAlso just a note to you, I don't know why you are so invested in this and starting to come across as aggressive, but I am open to this discussion and changing my mind. However that will not happen if you are passive aggressive or say someone's judgement is weird.\n\nIn marriage I find open communication the most important. Second to that is realizing what your partner feels is important to them and how they want to be loved. Of course marriages always have their arguments and fights, but coming together to grow and understand the other person is how a marriage lasts. If OP is to have an open discussion with her husband they will both realize they were both working with the same motivation: the heirloom is important and holds a lot of significance. How they operate with that belief is something they both have to come together on and agree to work as a unit. Be it that it's never worn again, it has to be insured, it should be worn on a necklace, it has to be resized, etc. won't happen until they have that missing discussion.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "No you're op bec\u00faase you said it 3-4 times", "That\u2019s quite an assumption, internet person.  \n\nYou literally didn\u2019t have to comment the above.

Not an AH if there was a short timeframe between when she received it and when the wedding was, not allowing her to have it sized.

Have a good day.", "Again if you had read my other comments as well as read my initial comment carefully you will see the issue is her lack of communication and changing her mind without telling him.\n\nHow many times must I say she can choose whatever she wants to do but it was an asshole move to make him believe she was wearing it when she wasn't.", "That's what you took from that comment?", "I didn\u2019t \u201cslip up.\u201d I\u2019ve just been saying I\u2019m OP bc y\u2019all kept calling me OP.", "My wife bought a small ring to wear outside the main ring(s). She calls it her lock ring.", "This is the way", "Until the metal hand goes rogue and strangles you.", "Ahhh yes. The age old husband who has a say. Again. She gets to choose what she does. Can she consider his feelings, sure, but at the end of the day I applaud her for being true to herself. But you all can be mad,all you want, and tell me I\u2019m wrong. Have fun with it. I\u2019m sure i will believe you. Buh-bye \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "This person is 100% certain I\u2019m OP.  I don\u2019t have any way to prove otherwise but if I say I\u2019m not, y\u2019all are even more \u201ccertain\u201d that I am. It\u2019s wild\n\nOf course, it\u2019s all this post. You\u2019ve been commenting since this morning also.", "I also did this as I lost weight. I love my wedding band, but it seems pretty impossible to downsize as it's made of titanium and I was paranoid about shipping it off. \n\nSo I got a super skinny ring (they're called stacking rings) that is the exact same tone as my band. it fits my finger securely, but it's wider than the opening of my band, so my band can't come off with it on, and it's too small to be noticeable against the thicker band.", "Y\u2019all are just saying I\u2019m a miserable person, abusing and reporting me to the crisis line, telling me I have no friends, calling me OP, etc. all because I posed an alternative perspective initially\u2026\n\nTo answer your question - Initially, no.", "No, I didn\u2019t make that generalization.  I was referring to him, specifically, if he just bought her an engagement ring.", "I mean I don't care about alternative perspectives, but what bothers me is you've wasted the time and energy to argue with every single person who said YTA to OP. Every. Single. One. And I bet when you find more, you'll respond to more. It's honestly just you patrolling the comment section and arguing with everyone that creates the problems, hence why people are insulting you for it--\nBecause you are literally showing everyone involved that they're absolutely correct to assume that you're a miserable person with nothing better to do. So, maybe, you wouldn't have this much hate if you just...\n\nDidn't comment anymore.", "No, I haven\u2019t but why does it bother you so much what I do with my time? \n\nThey\u2019re free to comment that I\u2019m a miserable person, etc. That\u2019s the \u201cbeauty,\u201d I suppose, of Free Speech.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t address the post I made, laying out 3 specific reasons why I think OP is an AH or that I have, in fact, agreed with multiple people. There are, however, over 300 comments and that can be a lot to work through.  \n\nI know you think you did a lot with your comment here and you should enjoy that superiority, if that\u2019s what you need to get through your day, but it\u2019s just Reddit.  \n\nI\u2019ve not hurt anyone. I\u2019ve not asked anyone to hurt anyone else. I merely, originally, offered an alternative perspective and it took a turn very quickly, as it does on Reddit, and as people are free to do.  \n\nEnjoy your day and maybe take some alternative perspectives into consideration as you go on about it.\n\nI\u2019m spending my \u201cThanksgiving\u201d working on helping my Tribe defend ICWA to SCOTUS. Maybe you have something better to do?\n\nEdit: you literally replied only to block me.  I replied the way I did because of the way you replied.  I\u2019m just matching energies at this point."]}
