I say this as a person who has an inherited ring that cannot be resized so I never wear it. However, there are ring guards you can add that will make it fit tighter on your finger. You can also wear a ring in front of the family heirloom that fits better to make sure the heirloom one doesn't fall off. I think in this case, you just didn't take the measures to insure its safety. The fact that you were being cautious is actually very respectful. Hopefully, you can make amends and wear it the next family outing with one of these counter measures.", "Oof, OP, this has been fun.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is you need to 1) talk to your Fianc\u00e9 about the ring 2) resolve the issue that\u2019s preventing you wearing the ring (if you want to wear it at all), and 3) (referring back to 1) work on your communication with your future partner.  \n\nYou should have worn the ring in some capacity; you said you would. In terms of a life-long commitment with someone, this was an easily avoidable issue/argument. While I think you should be able to wear and accessorize however One feels comfortable, this really never should have been an issue to begin with.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t like/want the ring, you should find a way to give it back to him/his family, so someone can wear/appreciate it proudly.  That doesn\u2019t take from your love for them, you just don\u2019t want it \u201ccollecting dust\u201d (as another commenter put it) when someone else could truly be enjoying it.  \n\nWe don\u2019t exactly know what issue prevented you from wearing it, but you\u2019re lack of communication and proactive steps to rectify whatever that issue was is crappy; you\u2019re the asshole in this scenario.", "ESH, but you less so than him.

Regardless if she had good intentions, he had communicated his wants twice. How hard is it to say \"Hey honey, I know you wanted me to wear the ring today but I'm really scared about loosing it.\" Or you know, after almost loosing it the first time, \"I wore the ring today and I almost lost it because of such and such reason.\" Starting a conversation about almost loosing it would've either led to them agreeing to not wear it out at all or problem solving so it doesn't happen again. Like another comment said, she could've worn it on a necklace. She obviously didn't think of this, but maybe they would've come to that idea together if she had started that discussion.\n\nIt shows that she didn't care enough to discuss the problem with him, that's what marriage is all about. Sharing your worries and solving problems together. If she did care, but didn't bring up this problem for another reason then there is some other problem going on in the marriage, but I see three times where OP could've started this discussion and avoided this outcome.\n\n1. When he first gave her the ring and told her it's an heirloom, very important, and would like it to be worn to special occasions. OP could've asked why, what's the history of the ring, the significance to his family. The fact that she so easily made the decision to not wear it, not tell him she changed her mind, and being surprised by his family's reaction shows that information was never discussed. Did she just say ok when he gave her the ring? Perhaps. \n\n2. After almost loosing it. She didn't tell her husband she almost lost an important piece of jewelry. Was she scared he was going to blame her? Then that could be a different issue in their marriage, but OP didn't say that so we can't know. She knew she would be expected to wear the ring again, since we do have more than one special occasion we go to in our lives. What did she expect would happen in the future? How is her husband to know she almost lost it if she doesn't say it?\n\n3. When OP decided not to wear the ring. This is where I would say she's an AH. There was clear communication beforehand when her husband asked her to wear the ring and SHE AGREED. He was operating under the knowledge and her confirmation that she was indeed wearing the ring. She can do whatever she wants, she can decide to wear it or not. It's her finger at the end of the day and ultimately her ring. However, could she not have let him know she had changed her mind and she's not wearing the ring? It's the fact that he specifically had asked her to wear the ring for this occasion. It would be a different story if he hadn't asked her to wear it, and had gotten upset because of that one time he asked her to wear it on special occasions when he gave it to her. To some degree she knew it was important to him for her to wear the ring, and had said yes. By letting him know they could've discussed this, and at least prepare themselves for the family's reaction. At the end of the day she had done a disservice to herself. \n\nAlso just a note to you, I don't know why you are so invested in this and starting to come across as aggressive, but I am open to this discussion and changing my mind. However that will not happen if you are passive aggressive or say someone's judgement is weird.\n\nIn marriage I find open communication the most important. Second to that is realizing what your partner feels is important to them and how they want to be loved. Of course marriages always have their arguments and fights, but coming together to grow and understand the other person is how a marriage lasts. If OP is to have an open discussion with her husband they will both realize they were both working with the same motivation: the heirloom is important and holds a lot of significance. How they operate with that belief is something they both have to come together on and agree to work as a unit. Be it that it's never worn again, it has to be insured, it should be worn on a necklace, it has to be resized, etc. won't happen until they have that missing discussion.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "No you're op bec\u00faase you said it 3-4 times", "That\u2019s quite an assumption, internet person.  \n\nYou literally didn\u2019t have to comment the above.

Obviously you were the wrong person to get it", "Yes I have. I lose it when I take it off my finger. So as long as she kept it on her finger I don\u2019t see why this would be an issue. I feel like OP just doesn\u2019t like the ring. And she\u2019s allowed to feel that way but this excuse she\u2019s using is why her husband may be upset. They initially agreed. This ring is important to him and I\u2019m sure it might even bother his family seeing that the ring is just collecting dust. There are many compromises they could\u2019ve taken. One comment said attaching the ring to a chain to wear as a necklace. That would\u2019ve been nice.", "I've had way more chains break than rings fall off my finger.

She said she would wear it. \n\nIf she hadn't agreed in the first place, or if she had had a discussion with fiance about it before the wedding, she would not be the asshole.\n\nOP is the asshole for agreeing to do something and then changing her mind without even mentioning it to her fiance when she knew how important it was.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Dude \ud83e\udd23 your trying SO hard to show your on OPs side when OP is the AH here, she said she would wear the ring,lied and took it off and caused alot of upset, like for FFS this woman got a second engagement ring and couldn't wear the one with the biggest meaning for 1 night, like come on , take the rose coloured glasses off and SEE OP is the ah!\n\n\nAnd I've saw your other comments,if the ring was too big to wear ,OP would have said that, so don't try that bs excuse \ud83d\ude44", "[deleted]", "What???? \nDid you forget what you wrote litrely 20 minutes ago????????", "Exactly, and the above served you in what way?", "Super cute, thank you.

It happened to my mother, with her mothers ring, simply carrying in groceries. \n\nSizing important pieces is a must if you intend on wearing them OR, as I\u2019ve mentioned, a clear sizer thing, but we don\u2019t know her intentions. \n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, if she accepted the ring without the intention of wearing it (or having it sized, with the family\u2019s permission), that\u2019s an ah move.

This characterization, if her intent was truly about keeping the ring safe, seems a little broad though. \n\nIn this scenario, she seems like an ah and not an ah. AH for not telling her fianc\u00e9 she was changing rings, but not an AH of her intent was to keep it safe.  An AH if she took the ring without intending on ever really wearing it. Not an AH if there was a short timeframe between when she received it and when the wedding was, not allowing her to have it sized.
