I say this as a person who has an inherited ring that cannot be resized so I never wear it. However, there are ring guards you can add that will make it fit tighter on your finger. You can also wear a ring in front of the family heirloom that fits better to make sure the heirloom one doesn't fall off. I think in this case, you just didn't take the measures to insure its safety. The fact that you were being cautious is actually very respectful. Hopefully, you can make amends and wear it the next family outing with one of these counter measures.", "Oof, OP, this has been fun.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is you need to 1) talk to your Fianc\u00e9 about the ring 2) resolve the issue that\u2019s preventing you wearing the ring (if you want to wear it at all), and 3) (referring back to 1) work on your communication with your future partner.  \n\nYou should have worn the ring in some capacity; you said you would. In terms of a life-long commitment with someone, this was an easily avoidable issue/argument. While I think you should be able to wear and accessorize however One feels comfortable, this really never should have been an issue to begin with.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t like/want the ring, you should find a way to give it back to him/his family, so someone can wear/appreciate it proudly.

How hard is it to say \"Hey honey, I know you wanted me to wear the ring today but I'm really scared about loosing it.\" Or you know, after almost loosing it the first time, \"I wore the ring today and I almost lost it because of such and such reason.\" Starting a conversation about almost loosing it would've either led to them agreeing to not wear it out at all or problem solving so it doesn't happen again. Like another comment said, she could've worn it on a necklace. She obviously didn't think of this, but maybe they would've come to that idea together if she had started that discussion.\n\nIt shows that she didn't care enough to discuss the problem with him, that's what marriage is all about. Sharing your worries and solving problems together. If she did care, but didn't bring up this problem for another reason then there is some other problem going on in the marriage, but I see three times where OP could've started this discussion and avoided this outcome.\n\n1. When he first gave her the ring and told her it's an heirloom, very important, and would like it to be worn to special occasions. OP could've asked why, what's the history of the ring, the significance to his family. The fact that she so easily made the decision to not wear it, not tell him she changed her mind, and being surprised by his family's reaction shows that information was never discussed. Did she just say ok when he gave her the ring? Perhaps. \n\n2. After almost loosing it. She didn't tell her husband she almost lost an important piece of jewelry. Was she scared he was going to blame her? Then that could be a different issue in their marriage, but OP didn't say that so we can't know. She knew she would be expected to wear the ring again, since we do have more than one special occasion we go to in our lives. What did she expect would happen in the future? How is her husband to know she almost lost it if she doesn't say it?\n\n3. When OP decided not to wear the ring. This is where I would say she's an AH. There was clear communication beforehand when her husband asked her to wear the ring and SHE AGREED. He was operating under the knowledge and her confirmation that she was indeed wearing the ring. She can do whatever she wants, she can decide to wear it or not. It's her finger at the end of the day and ultimately her ring. However, could she not have let him know she had changed her mind and she's not wearing the ring? It's the fact that he specifically had asked her to wear the ring for this occasion. It would be a different story if he hadn't asked her to wear it, and had gotten upset because of that one time he asked her to wear it on special occasions when he gave it to her. To some degree she knew it was important to him for her to wear the ring, and had said yes. By letting him know they could've discussed this, and at least prepare themselves for the family's reaction. At the end of the day she had done a disservice to herself. \n\nAlso just a note to you, I don't know why you are so invested in this and starting to come across as aggressive, but I am open to this discussion and changing my mind. However that will not happen if you are passive aggressive or say someone's judgement is weird.\n\nIn marriage I find open communication the most important. Second to that is realizing what your partner feels is important to them and how they want to be loved. Of course marriages always have their arguments and fights, but coming together to grow and understand the other person is how a marriage lasts. If OP is to have an open discussion with her husband they will both realize they were both working with the same motivation: the heirloom is important and holds a lot of significance. How they operate with that belief is something they both have to come together on and agree to work as a unit. Be it that it's never worn again, it has to be insured, it should be worn on a necklace, it has to be resized, etc. won't happen until they have that missing discussion.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "No you're op bec\u00faase you said it 3-4 times", "That\u2019s quite an assumption, internet person.  \n\nYou literally didn\u2019t have to comment the above.

Not an AH if there was a short timeframe between when she received it and when the wedding was, not allowing her to have it sized.

You shouldn't have agreed in the first place if you weren't comfortable, but you have the right to change your mind and you should've told him you'd changed your mind instead of blindsiding him.", "Didn't she say she almost lost it? How? Is it not the right size?\n\nESH\nOP is for going back on her weird and not communicating clearly as to how she felt\nFiance for pressuring OP into wearing an heirloom. She's clearly aware of how much it means and doesn't want to lose it\nFiance's family for constantly bringing it up", "Why is it dumb? Heirloom jewelry can be insanely expensive, that could easily be a $50k+ ring for all you know, I think it\u2019s reasonable that as a guy he might want to buy something himself for his fianc\u00e9 while still giving her something that isn\u2019t appropriate to wear daily.", "I\u2019m not even sure how OP could lose it if she\u2019s wearing it, unless it\u2019s too big. If that\u2019s the case they could have it adjusted so it fits properly", "Just get the ring resized to fit", "Why should she be forced to wear ring that she does not like ... and why should she be forced to resize family ring that she does not want to wear and cant wait to give to someone else.", "No, I have never been in a situation to tell my husband please change your appearance to be accepted by my family and/or friends because he is accepted the way he is. And I have never heard those words and, had I heard them, I would have made sure to wear my gothest, trashiest outfit, which I normally wouldn't do.", "I bought a tiny thin band for just this reason.", "YTA.\n\nHe's not even requiring you to wear it everyday. Just on, and I quote you, \"special occasions and at certain events\". How hard is that? Is the ring too loose? There are hacks to prevent it from slipping off. \n\nYou get TWO engagement rings. One your style and the other your future husband's family heirloom. Some people can't even afford to have one.", "Not an Asshole (but pretty damn close) as much as you not understanding the importance of the ring to him. You should have worn it since you said you would If it is a sizing issue, get it resized or a ring sizing insert.", "sorry but you are the AH  you promised and then you broke that promise sorry but you knew how important the ring is to the family and you didnt even wear it", "Coil yarn around the underside of the ring and it will stay on properly.", "YTA and you did it despite knowing how important it is to him and you know it, don't act like you are innocent", "YTA! And incredibly inconsiderate.", "You literaly just could\u2019ve said \u2018I\u2019m scared I\u2019m gonna lost it\u2019 and find a solution.YTA.", "1) she's not being forced... She agreed, but went back on her word\n2) it's only for ONE event\n3) it's VERY important to her partner", "Do you not understand how to put a ring on a necklace?\n\nOr get a ring resized? \n\nOr lock it in with another ring?", "YTA", "Your guy gave you two rings...one for tradition and one for you.  Bet he regrets thinking about you now that he knows you are not thinking about him much.  YTA.", "NTA. You were paranoid about losing it. The backlash from losing it would've been way worse.", "YTA for even thinking you needed to ask if YTA because clearly you were the AH then and YTA now.  In case you don't catch my drift, YTA. And one more for good measure...YTA.", "NTA.", "I'm surprised with the judgement of others. I'll say NTA because you married him, not his family. idk why they're all on their wits about it when it's something personal to you two. i can't tell if the fiance himself cares about the ring or is only insistent on it because of the family.\n\nthey've made something that should've been a nice gesture into something burdensome.", "Nta. Jfc, what busy bodies. You were worried you would lose it. Does  it need resized? People are the worst", "hopping on the top comment.\n\nNo judgement, if you're scared to lose the ring purchase a simple thin band that fits so it stays  on.", "This and in general, OP, it\u2019s such a sentimental thing for his family and they willingly want you to wear it. What\u2019s it saying to their welcoming gesture of inclusivity when you refuse to wear it even for family functions? If their heritage/lifestyle isn\u2019t for you, it\u2019s odd you accepted the ring and married into the family just to dismiss this important artefact and gesture from them. Passing on such a valued heirloom is not a light decision, they didn\u2019t just give you a gift/trinket - they\u2019ve included you and your future generations to come, it extend beyond your lifetime. To me that\u2019s grand and I\u2019d treat it with the respect due.", "My mom almost lost an heirloom ring that way! Thankfully the person behind her was honest and turned it in. It's not worth a lot of money but multiple generations have worn it so the loss would have hurt.", "I found my people!"]}
