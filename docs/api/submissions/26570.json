Divorce is always an option over infidelity.  Even if that person is financially dependent on said spouse.  Divorce is expensive and heartbreaking but if you live somewhere that accepts at-fault divorces, it's a whole other level of cost.

What your husband is guilty of is concealing this, but from your reaction I'd say it would be understandable that he might want to avoid the current situation.

If it ends up being true, and it\u2019s exactly as your mother explained, then personally, I think it\u2019s forgivable. Although it\u2019s obviously weird to think that your partner slept with your mother, it did happen before you got together, and although you could argue that he\u2019s not been completely honest with you, since it\u2019s something you\u2019d obviously want to know, it is also understandable as to why he wouldn\u2019t tell you, or why it may become a difficult thing to bring up. You have to be reasonable there. When you first started dating, he may have not considered that you\u2019d end up together long term and have a child together.\n\nAs for telling your father, that\u2019s also a tricky decision. I feel like you need to talk to your mother again as well, and have her explain her reasoning for having an affair, perhaps it\u2019s something your father is aware of, maybe there\u2019s personal issues between them going on, or as disturbing as it may be, it could be something that they\u2019re both into. You need to establish the facts, before you act. Although cheating isn\u2019t ideal and can be a terrible thing, marriage isn\u2019t all sunshine and roses, people have affairs for many reasons, and some of them can be justified. Like maybe your father has a low sex drive, or is impotent, and to keep the marriage together, your mother needs to look elsewhere. You just have to be grown up and adult about it. It\u2019s easy to condemn someone for cheating, and to think that you\u2019re doing the right thing telling your father, but you might cause them both misery by doing so.", "i just dont understand this constant mentality with people to just avoid their spouse", "There is a rat in that kitchen.", "I have to agree OP, although I would also say that you do need to approach this as calmly and deliberately as possible (which is hard because yikes just all of this yikes).\n\nYour mom\u2019s actions make no sense.

Not saying for sure sue is lying but it raises questions. \n\nHere is the good news: while this is gross and upsetting (by the way, I\u2019m wicked sorry) this happened before you and your husband started dating. He didn\u2019t cheat on you, which would have been an instant dealbreaker. Still icky, but not as icky. \n\nSo approach him as calmly as you can. Tell him what your mother told you and get his side of things. Find out why he never told you. Look for any inconsistencies in his story. \n\nOnce you have that information, I am torn about if you should tell your dad. On the one hand, his wife cheated on him, and he has a right to know. On the other, this could very much blow up your relationship with him by proxy; certainly he\u2019ll never want to see your husband again and possibly even his grandchild. \n\nHonestly, I wish your mom had kept her mouth shut here. This could have been a secret she took to her grave and no one would be the wiser and no one would be hurt. But now she has made it your problem.  I\u2019m sorry.", "He couldn\u2019t tell her without exposing the mother for cheating. He was in a tough spot. And he hadn\u2019t known OP then.  But, yes, they need to talk about this.", "Mother sounds certifiable. Let's suppose she's telling the truth - she thinks OP should move back home? Home with a cheating, pseudo-incestuous mother? What kind of home is that?\n\nWhich raises the question of whether Mom is telling the truth or what version of the truth she may be telling. Mom sounds sketchy in at least some respects. Is she a reliable narrator?\n\nSo, OP, talk to your husband. I am not saying he may be blameless, just that at this stage you would be unwise to rely solely on what your mother said.\n\nYes, it will be hard. No, it's not avoidable.", "OP, I\u2019m betting this didn\u2019t happen *before* you got together. If it was before, why does she want you to leave him now? Think back on your mother\u2019s behaviour toward your husband throughout your relationship and try to recall any changes. Ask your husband when it happened without telling him what your mother said about the timeline.", "Either mom is making this up, or mom is just insane, bc the plan of \"leave your husband and move in with me to raise your baby\" makes no sense when the husband didn't cheat and OP's father doesn't know.", ">I would say, \u201cMy mother confessed that you two met a year before we got together.\u201d  Do not give additional information. Let him explain his version.\n\nThis is good advice. I have a sneaking suspicion that the mother made this story up but I'd love to see the expression on OP's husband's face when she asks him.", "Mom probably already told OPs husband she told OP xyz. She gave them time to come up with a story together.", "There is something definitely strange here\u2026.they been together for 5 years and suddenly this is exploding. There\u2019s been a wedding and everything something doesn\u2019t add up.", "I\u2019m thinking the same things", "If my buddy banged my mom I certainly wouldn\u2019t go around saying he did nothing wrong.", "No he should have told her. Its called being honest and open I hate the idea of what they dont know wont hurt them because that wrong. Sleeping with someones mother and then hiding it means that they are getting into a relationship with false pretences. If youve done something that you know will affect your chances at that relationship tell them.", ">he did sleep with someone who he knew was married.\n\nWe don't know that he knew", "But did OP\u2019s husband know that her mother (or, rather, sex partner at the time) was married? OP doesn\u2019t state that.\n\nOP, I believe you could really use a therapist to navigate this very unfortunate situation, as opposed to going to your brother. Make an appointment ASAP, either immediately before or after you speak with your husband.", "Omg really? Mum cheated on op\u2019s dad with her husband and you are saying this to them? Op please ignore this persons deranged view! If you cannot stand to look at your mother are you going to treat your husband the same?? Both of them kept it a secret and it doesn\u2019t matter that it happened before you got with him, it should of been disclosed to you especially when you got serious! Good luck with whatever you decide. NTA please keep yourself and your child safe!", "Seems weird to wait until now. Not mentioning anything while OP was dating or engaged. Only now, after the pregnancy announcement. It is quite likely that a 30ish couple would have a child, so if it causes such a concern for the mother,  why wait until now.\n\nSounds like mother is trying to get a narrative happening before OP talks to OP's husband and gets his side.", "The mom's response to me sounds like jealousy. Maybe the pregnancy triggered her to realize the relationship is not going away.", "You've made very good points, here. \n\nIt would be very interesting to get the husband's side of the story.", "Agree with all of this, and started to post something very similar. There are too many unknowns \u2014 and too much weirdness \u2014 to share this with bro and dad now. OP needs to talk to her husband. Were there any hints of a prior relationship between mom and husband? Why wouldn\u2019t the husband nope out when he realized he\u2019d had sex with mom too? And why would he marry her without disclosing? He\u2019s in the dark right now, and, frankly, this whole thing is just weird. It sucks, but before it goes any further, OP needs to talk to the husband.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry mom dumped this on the OP right now. And I\u2019m really ticked she\u2019s kept it to herself for 5+ years. If this is even true, mom had a chance to come clean before OP married the guy, and instead, she saves for maximum devastation? I have serious doubts it\u2019s even true. All point to Mom being the massive flaming AH. \n\nYTA if you don\u2019t get to the bottom of this first, OP. ((((hugs))))", "Has op ever considered that mother is lying and just doesn't like SIL?", "I\u2019m betting it didn\u2019t happen *before* they got together, because the mother would have been against the relationship from the start.", "I agree something is strange about this. And why would mom wait for baby news to reveal?  I almost think mom is still sleeping with husband.", "He didn\u2019t cheat on his wife, it wasn\u2019t even when they were dating.\n\nHe was single at the time. You may not like that it happened but that doesn\u2019t make it wrong.", "They were not a couple somewhere is the conflict? Some contributors become all ethically when their family is not effected. There is no predator here.", "Becuse she wants to break them, the question was why now, this shoud be a concern from the begining and she said nothing.Maybe the affair got more real somehow now that the grandkid is going to be arriving soon.There is for sure more dirt to be uncovered.I hope this is a fake post.", ">The mom's response to me sounds like jealousy. Maybe the pregnancy triggered her to realize the relationship is not going away.\n\nI agree. I don't trust the mother's story at this point.", "Reminds me of The Graduate lol The mom could have told OP when she started dating her now hb, if she cared so much about her daughter dating/marrying her ex. What happens next in mom's weird mind? She and SIL will elope?", "Yeah, but I'd also be deeply disturbed he started with the mom, and ended up with the daughter.", ">my brother (22M) who is close friends with my husband  \n\nI\u2019m talking about the brother. Its fucked up.", "The conflict is that the mother was (is) still married to OP\u2019s father, so SHE had the affair. Revealing that would mean she reveals an affair that could break up her parents\u2019 marriage.", "There's also the chance OP's egg donor is lying, and trying to break them up so she can have a baby to raise.", "Looking at the time line, they might\u2019ve become friends after they started dating. OP and husband are 5 years together, he slept with mother a year before, so at least 6 years. I doubt that a 16 year old was already close friends with a 27 year old. \nAnd if they were, we really need more info about the relationships and timeline between all these people.", "Oh, gotcha. Sorry about that.  Yeah I can see that.", "I don't think he was buddies with the brother until he and OP were together. If the brother is 22 now he would have been 15-16 at the time of this incident and OPs husband would have been 26-27. At that age you aren't friends with a 16 year old.", "Why though?", "Their mother cheated on their father with her current husband! Where is the conflict? Op is currently pregnant and found out they slept together? There\u2019s the conflict!", "Yeah I dunno, I\u2019m thinking they\u2019re family friends with the husband. They fucked a year before OP started dating him, not a year before they met.", "Look, we\u2019ve had this conversation. You can\u2019t fuck your buddies mom.", "Both are the conflict! It\u2019s a conflict sandwich!", "I haven\u2019t had this conversation.  Okay she\u2019s married but take that out of the equation.  Single mom looking to fuck a younger guy?  Two consensual adults?  It\u2019s private business.  So why not?", "Uh huh. And a dad banging his daughters friend is totally normal right?", "Yeah it\u2019s pretty standard actually.  Men want younger women.  That\u2019s why older women take great measure to appear youthful."]}
