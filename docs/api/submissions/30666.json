{"id": 30666, "submission_id": "17rki3t", "title": "AITA for kicking a woman out of a study room during a meeting?", "selftext": "Okay this whole situation isn\u2019t even that big a deal but I\u2019ve been questioning myself \n\nMe (22f) am a college student. My college has study rooms in the library you can book most the day. I like to book them because I have ADHD and it helps me study. \n\nA lot of students who don\u2019t book rooms will use rooms if they see no one else in the rooms, which isn\u2019t a big deal as if you book the room and someone is in there, usually you just tell them you have it booked and they leave no problem. \n\nAnyways yesterday I had a room booked and there were 2 students in there, a guy and a girl. I said I had the room booked, the guy left and was like \u201coh I don\u2019t know her\u201d and the woman (40\u2019s? F) was in the middle of a zoom meeting. He left and I waited a couple moments to see if she would notice me but she didn\u2019t respond. Eventually I\u2019m like \u201coh hey I actually have this room booked\u201d and she didn\u2019t respond, I wait like 2 more minutes and ask again. She gives me the \u201cone moment\u201d finger but doesn\u2019t say anything then leaves after like a minute and I\u2019m like ok. \n\nShe comes back like 15 minutes later while I\u2019m studying and says \u201cexcuse me, I was not bothering you earlier and I only needed 10 more minutes in my meeting. That was not pleasant.\u201d \n\nSo now I\u2019m like, damn AITA? \n\nBut in my mind I also feel like she could have either booked her own room or just told me she needed 10 minutes and I wouldn\u2019t have minded. But also I didn\u2019t want her in the room while I was studying because I couldn\u2019t concentrate and she was talking quite loud. \n\nAlso it\u2019s common sense at my college that it\u2019s fine to take an empty study room but don\u2019t get too comfortable because if someone booked it you\u2019re getting kicked out. \n\nAITA? \n\nTLDR; kicked a woman (40\u2019sF) out of a study room I (22f) booked while she was in a zoom meeting", "created_utc": 1699557063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rki3t/aita_for_kicking_a_woman_out_of_a_study_room/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
