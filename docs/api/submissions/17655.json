You have a family emergency. If she wanted to join you she should have said so.", "NTA\n\nI am sorry for your loss. Your GF should support you in whatever you need now. Wrong time to be mad at you.", "NAH leaning towards her being a slight asshole. She probably assumed you both would go and she wanted to support you, but this is not the time for that kind of conflict or for her to make it about herself.\n\nIt all boils down to this. If you want her to go with you for support, then take her. If you don't want her there for whatever reason, she needs to respect that decision.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, OP. I hope the situation smooths over for your sake.", "NTA. Lady has to learn that men are not mind readers and this is really not the time to get mad over something like this.", "NTA. Your gf needs to be supportive in this situation and not make it about her. It was her responsibility to ask you \"do you want me to come?\" Even if you did \"forget\" to include her, that's 100% understandable because you're dealing with grief brain.", "NAH.  I am hesitant to call you TA because your dad just died.  That's a lot on your plate, and I am sorry for your loss.  \n\nBut, your GF is not TA either.  It's common to go with your partner during a traumatic event like this.  I can understand why she's upset.  She should not have to ask to go with you.  This isn't a vacation or a fun trip.  \n\nAll of that said...  It sounds like you've come up with a lot of reasons why you DID NOT want her to go.  What do you see in the future with her?  If you aren't wanting to include her in times like these, is she your real partner or just someone you're spending time with?  \n\nIn short, much like most problems in AITA, it's not really about the funeral.", "I'm sorry for your loss. \n\n\nNAH. You're both fetuses so communication isn't a strong suit. Typically, when an event like this happens the spouse (or play spouse) always attends with you for support. If you did not want her to come, you should have communicated that you wanted her to stay home. That's not something she would \"ask to come\" about. It's a given. Similarly, she should have been more proactive before the flight booking process, communicating about travel plans and accommodations. If I found out my husband lost his father, the first words out of my mouth would be \"I'll book our flight now\" and then condolences second. It's almost like you two are roommates instead of loving life partners, kinda weird.", "NTA - depending on how serious you guys are it's not on the list of things that you should be worrying about.\n\nI wonder if you haven't introduced her to your family yet. \nMaybe she heard the news and figured this was her chance to jump to that stage in your relationship. She was probably banking on the fact that you're too distracted right now to say no, and isn't secure enough in your relationship to believe you'll never make that step with her. She also probably wanted you to be the one to bring it up because then she wouldn't have to feel bad about thinking this way. You guys are so young, so it's not a judgment on her behalf, more just a maturity thing. \n\nI'm so sorry about your dad, don't forget to try and sit with the grief during the funeral instead of letting all the change be a distraction. There's never going to be another time when all the people who loved your dad are going to be in the same room and who are probably ready to give you any support you need if you asked", "NAH.  I'm sorry for your loss.  This is just about communication between you.  You should have discussed it and not assumed about each other.  But it is a stressful time and you aren't thinking clearly.  If she wants to support you, someone else can watch the pets.  No need for a big fight, just talk.", "NAH this is simply a miscommunication. You assumed she would stay with the pets, she assumed she was joining you. Learn to speak up, even when you think the answer is \u201ea given\u201c.", "Nta\nNot the asshole since your dealing with alot. However you should expect your girlfriend to come with for emotional support. I don't see why she wouldn't expect to come and it'd be in poor taste if she didn't. Board your pets or hire a pet sitter.", "YTA - Going against the grain here.\n\nYour romantic partner being with you on such an important event is normal and expected. If my partner did what you did to me, I would immediately believe them and comprehend that I'm genuinely and truly un-important to them.\n\nNot wanting your SO to be with you on such an important funeral is also a little weird. Why would you not want **the person you love most on this planet** to be with you in such event? Why wouldn't your default stance for that event to be with them?", "ESH she could have offered earlier, you could have asked.  She seems to want to help support you in your tough time.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am rolling over that! Absolutely hilarious", "I think it depends on how long theyve been together - they're so young.

Even if there is more to it, do you really think its justified for her to get upset at him? If (after the funeral), she wanted to have a talk with him about where their relationship is going, why he didn't want her there, that would be one thing, but to get upset at someone for not booking travel for her as well, at this moment, is incredibly selfish.", "I get that \ud83e\udd23\nRegardless of how long it had been(within reason), I dont think I'd skip my boyfriends father's funeral. Only way I wouldn't support him is if money was tight, couldn't afford time off, or a huge obligation i couldn't get out of. But I'd exhaust all options trying to make it work.

Which is why I think maybe he thinks they're just not there yet.", "It could be that he doesn't want to juggle the funeral and being a good host to his girlfriend who maybe hasn't been there yet or much. I was going to ask about the pet thing, but then again I've seen 21yos he awfully loose with the definition of \"my pet\". If she's gone home with him before and met his family then I'd say its odd for sure but at the end of the day I think he gets to go about however he wants"]}
