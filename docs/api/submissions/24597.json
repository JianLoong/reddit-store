It\u2019s not ok to humiliate and body shame her in front of others.", "ESH, you definitely could have been nicer, you were quite harsh. She's  an AH as she can't expect you to pay for her food. Even for sisters, you shouldn't have been so harsh considering how that affected her. Your actions were seriously uncalled for.", "ESH\nShe should have been more considerate and not assumed people would cover for her getting more, but yeah, calling her fat was not nice. You can criticize her without criticizing her weight  because if she was skinny, doing the same thing would still be a jerk move. That being said, I don't know if she has an ED like BED, but I know what it's like to be a fat teenager, especially presenting as a girl, and it sucks. Shaming her won't make her eat less; in fact, it will make her double down because that's how people work. We are stubborn creatures. Also, I think the fact that another person started it, but you not only did nothing to stand up for her, but played along, probably really did hurt her. Insulting people for their looks is just mean spirited, and remember that even if you live with her (not sure you do), you don't know what's going on inside her head. BED is just as serious as restrictive disorders, and she could have something else going on like a thyroid or hormone problem. \nTl;dr: You both need to be more considerate. You need to apologize, and she needs to prepare before going out to eat so that she's not expecting others to cover for her.", "ESH\n\nYes, you should only pay for what you bought. But insulting and humiliating her makes you a much bigger AH. Sounds like these \"friends\" really bring out the absolute worst in you.", "I am confused. Why didn't everyone pay individually for the food if money and the transactional system were not an issue?  This whole situation sounds weird. Did you each order specific things or random things to share? Here's what I am getting at, when I was younger, I had some AH friends I thought could be friends with my other group of friends. The AHs thought the others didn't fit the mold for being my friend, but I disagreed and honestly thought we could all get along. I thought I was doing a good thing by creating a bridge between varying personalities. Unlike in your situation, they knew not to cross the line and be disrespectful when I was present. I was in my late 20s when a longtime friend informed me that those outings and social events were not what I stupidly perceived them to be. Instead, the AHs used those opportunities to belittle them when I stepped away, to get ammunition against them, and anything else to prove to them they did not belong. To this day, I don't understand why those three people remain my friend, especially since they never held me accountable. And yes, the AHs, including myself, should have been held responsible for the pain inflicted. \n\nYou are young, but you will soon learn that every innocent-funny-in-the-moment comment isn't what it seems. Unfortunately, you didn't get a chance to understand that before hurting your sister. By the way, the description of your sister in comparison to yourself and the \"whole lot more\" comment shows me that you are attempting to, in a sense, dehumanize her to make what happen any less awful. It is for that reason I would have to say YTA. I have a friend who is a size two and can out-eat most people and does it at every outing. She, too, will always insist that we split the check or tab equally. Yes, the entitlement is astounding, so I would have to say your sister is also an AH; if each of you ordered the items \"you\" were going to eat. We have learned over time to notify the server beforehand that the checks are separate. However, if, as a group, you all ordered random things and agreed to split the bill ahead of the gathering, no, she is not the AH. You all decided to split the check beforehand, and unfortunately, there will always be someone who eats or drinks less or more or chooses less or more expensive items. It is the nature of the beast when you agree to split the check.", "YTA. She shouldn\u2019t have expected for y\u2019all to pay more because she ordered more, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t have let your friends talk to her like that. If someone said that to one of my siblings I\u2019d tell em to fuck off. Dude.", "YTA and so is your friend.\n\nYou guys are cruel. You know you hurt her (she even told you that you did), and now you \"kinda\" feel bad? That's disturbing.", "Yes YTA.  Be better. Be kinder. You can get your point across without being mean", "ESH you don't need to say that to her but she can't expect other to pay for her food.", "ETA. People who want to split the bill equally when they've ordered much more than everyone else are assholes. But you didn't need to be nasty about her weight. She already knows she is fat. Make it about the amount she ordered vs what everyone else ordered, not about what she looks like.", "Gee.. what a nice sister. At some point how you behave is you as a person.. whether people need to wake up or not.. you made your sibling cry.. why are you even asking..", "YTA \n\nIt was unnecessary and cruel to comment on her weight. She is a 16 year old girl with all the insecurities a 16 year old girl has. You should know better.\n\nAnd to top it all off, you AND your friends taunted her in public. \n\nYou should have just paid for what you ordered and left it at that. If she had an issue with that, tell her to speak to her parents about it.\n\nAnd just so you know, people who are overweight, or have acne, or any other noticeable physical characteristic are already well aware.

But Reddit is concerned mainly about opinions rather than facts anyway. Here is mine, it is an AH mindset to use any flaw to demean someone. Don't like something, ok, you have that right. But how you react determines your proximity to the throne of A**holery. No one thinks it is ok to call someone stupid, especially a child. Yet, in our society, stupidity far precedes all other imperfections. Here's the thing people love to believe it is ok to say and do what they want until that same mindset gets used against them or their loved ones. Then it's a shame and a problem. \n\nStorytime! A guy I stupidly called a friend when I was younger is probably a great example of this. This guy was perhaps, at any given time, the biggest AH/bully in a 30-mile radius. A few years ago, someone who is still a friend had an issue where her stepson was among the boys bullying this man's son.  I remember this man's father excusing his behavior as boys will be boys when we were younger. He took his father\"s pitiful excuse as law. Yet, when he was on the opposite side of the table,  his thought process was different. Even funnier, he continues to engage in the same behavior himself. Nevertheless, as any parent should, my friend and her husband did not tolerate their son's behavior and acted to ensure it wouldn't happen again. However, the hypocrisy did not go unnoticed.\n\n AHs and bullies don't always raise carbon copies, yet they don't see the hypocrisy when the shoe is on the other foot. It is laughable the hypocrisy we all spout every day. If only humans were born with a muscle or an organ that allowed us to consider others' feelings or perhaps ponder the situation in reverse. \ud83e\udd14 Better yet, what if we could control ourselves and know that opinions are like an a**hole? Everyone has one and thinks that theirs is more important than others. Wow, what if! \ud83d\ude32 If only! Maybe, then the word \"truth\" would not be used as a scapegoat for AHs.\ud83d\ude0f  Honesty and being an AH don't go hand in hand. An AH would use a person's flaw(s) to demean them, just as an AH would feel entitled enough to expect others to pay their way.  But it takes a true AH not to ask questions and encourage AHs to be AHs and attempt to disguise it as truth. Or, who knows, maybe the person has confused being an AH with brutal honesty. It is not uncommon, but it is not the same, and a bit tiring and boring.\ud83e\udd71  However, it takes an even bigger AH to waste ten minutes to point all this out, knowing that they are a massive AH. \ud83d\ude08 What do you think?

Geezus you couldve just argued the food quantity and there was no need for \"fat ass\" to be thrown around. \n\nAnd you laughed - in her face at that comment.   You are quite the smug little monster, aren't you?", "YTA. You made your point, everyone should pay for what they ordered. that is very fair. And maybe you would get a pass for not defending your stepsister from someone else calling her fat, but to laugh at her and pile on? That sucks.", "Of course you are the asshole.", "YTA.\n\nThere were so many other ways to express to her that you are not willing to cover her share of the bill and allowing your friends to mock her and then joining in with them is horrible. What you did was just show her that you don't care about her feelings and would rather join in on your friends' mocking than stick up for her as a sister.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. She paid thinking she could just push you all into paying equally for her share too. Nope. It was her choice to eat that much. She needs ti pay for her own mess.", "YTA wow yeah you all were very harsh and hurtful! There was no need to call her fat and all laugh at her. So cruel. You should have pushed the fact that her order was significantly more money without the name calling. My heart hurts for her.", "YTA YTA YTA\n\nSO are your friends.", "ESH - your stepsister for expecting and insisting on people paying her meal and you for being unnecessary mean.", "YTA. it didn\u2019t need to be said. should she pay for what she got? absolutely. but you were cruel. you should feel more than \u201ckinda bad\u201d.", "YTA. You can be nice and reasonable too. Instead, you were cruel and unhelpful.", "ESH", "No she need to be bullied. Being nice to her has obviously left her fat and sad. Remember America was skinnier when bullying was in person.", "She ordered two double-doubles, two fries, and a milkshake. The rest of us all ordered one cheeseburger or double-double, fries (I shared the fries with a friend), and a drink or milkshake. We calculated how much each of our food cost and added sales tax. We didn\u2019t tip since it\u2019s fast food.", "That's what it sounds like to me, it also seems like there was some shared food that the stepsister may have eaten more of....but it's shared food, meaning it's fine if one eats more.  I highly doubt a teenage girl who is overweight would put herself in a situation to be made fun of that obviously by ordering double the amount of food that everyone else had.  It sounds like a common but cruel over-exaggeration by the op.", "We dud", "We ordered separate meals", "It\u2019s a fast food restaurant and you pay at the counter. We didn\u2019t want to hold up the line so she paid for everyone.", "We added tax and she paid for everyone because there were a lot of people their and we didn\u2019t want to hold up the line.", "She really did eat as much as two people (two burgers and two fries)", "Highly highly highly doubt this is the only time they\u2019ve made cruel comments to this poor girl. Girls like this in friend groups like that tend to be punching bags", "\u201cEveryone sucks here\u201d, I think.", "I read the post, looks like you misunderstood my comment. If the stepsister kept pushing for them to pay more she could have gone to her parents or just flat out refused, comments about someone\u2019s body are unnecessary to get what you want in this situation and are just mean", "I think it's very plausible that the stepsister paid for tax for the entire order on top of *not* eating double the food.  Teenagers are cruel, and large teenagers know they will be targeted if they eat too much in front of others.  I don't think there's enough info here because what is there seems colored far too favorably for the op, and it still makes her look like such a gigantic asshole compared to a more tame one of the step sister.  That's what gives me pause and unable to really give a verdict.", "Depends on who was in the friendship group first also. Some could argue it's nice for stepsisters to want to be friends with each other, but others could argue that if they live together, it's healthy to have their own separate social lives.\n\nWe don't really know the context behind these two girls' usual socialising situations, if this situation was a first time offence, if they usually get along etc... but I would say going forward that the best thing to do for any social gatherings involving payments, for EVERYONE (not just this situation) would be to just get separate bills going forward to allow for equal payments etc. I don't drink alcohol and I usually have limited food options I can go for (religiously and allergy-wise) so my food and drinks are usually cheaper than other people's, who go for several beers/wines, steak and starters AND dessert. As such, I've become more confident over the years in insisting on itemised payments.", "Okay so maybe in the future you can say we\u2019ll split according to meals instead of fat shaming. I know you didn\u2019t actively intend to hurt her but it does hurt.", "I don\u2019t get it either. I was never mean to my own friends. That\u2019s so wild but I also wasn\u2019t mean to anyone.. except people who hurt my friends haha", "Ok", "Because whining for more money isn\u2019t equally as cruel as ganging up and honing in on someone\u2019s insecurities for a laugh?", "If the other friends can just casually share In-n-out with no hassle, then why should they make their lives harder to accommodate someone who tries to cheat them? \n\nIf you can't play by the rules that allow us all to have a relaxed good time, then you're welcome to go play elsewhere.\n\nI was too lax as a teenager, honestly. As an adult I won't tolerate this shit and I should have stated earlier.", "Also if sister was collecting the cost of the order, did she order it on her card or dime? Like was the idea one person would order and then everyone would pay step sister back. Which if that\u2019s the case was tax added or if a tip was needed was that added to everyone\u2019s totals. I would really like to know the breakdown of this bill. \n\nI\u2019m betting everyone was paying for what they ate but step sister was asking for their total of the tax and, if needed, the tip. And then that\u2019s when they humiliated her. \n\nSomething for me isn\u2019t adding up.", "It's like seeing two people across the room. One tickles the other, and the other responds by cutting the tickler's head off. Yeah, person 1 shouldn't have been tickling, but, c'mon.", "Yeah I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s a pretty delusional comparison, even considering what one person did was a lot worse than tickling, and (the other) calling someone fat is not anywhere near cutting someone\u2019s head off.", "So not on this comment chain or anywhere there would be any reason to think I was responding to?", "Such a kind answer. You are a nice and mature person u/BigComfyCouch4", "nah", "Yeah, the lack of this info is telling.  I think it's likely if they reply they'd lie at this point due to how the comments have panned out, so not providing it to start with kind of makes me lean towards seperate meals....but also some shared, and very likely all of the tax paid for by the step sister because she ate more than anyone else.", "I agree that people do pussyfoot around about weight A LOT. And there are plenty of people that are in denial about their weight being an issue. But for the most part, people know they\u2019re fat and that it is an issue. \n\nWhat they don\u2019t need is someone literally calling them a fat ass and making fun of how much they eat. It\u2019s not constructive criticism, it\u2019s just being an asshole. It\u2019s an easy way to attack someone because they obviously couldn\u2019t come up with anything else besides the obvious.", "As long as no one pays for her extra food, then she didn't benefit. \n\nBut in 10 years, when she looks back on all the different situations, it will make a difference if her sister laughed at the fat jokes.\n\nI am not saying they should pay for her food. Idk what you mean by railroad through life \ud83e\udd14\n\nThey are teens. Of course they acted their age.", "Seriously. It\u2019s not fair to split costs when someone else owes way more but there\u2019s no reason to bring her weight into it in order to get your point across. How rude", "Same. Teenage girls are so vicious for no reason. My childhood friends were like that, thank god im not around them anymore", "Yes, thank you! There's a difference between telling the truth, and using the truth to denigrate someone. \n\n  \nI'm a woman. That's just a fact. But when boys would insult me as a child by saying \"stop being such a GIRL,\" they weren't just stating a fact about my gender. They were using my gender as an insult. \n\n  \nSimilarly, I am fat. I don't mind when people say this about me in a neutral, factual sense. But calling me a \"fatass\" is not okay, because you're taking a word that describes me and you're making it an insult when it doesn't need to be.\n\n  \nOP wasn't just telling the truth here. They were being rude AF for no reason."]}
