It\u2019s not ok to humiliate and body shame her in front of others.", "ESH, you definitely could have been nicer, you were quite harsh. She's  an AH as she can't expect you to pay for her food. Even for sisters, you shouldn't have been so harsh considering how that affected her. Your actions were seriously uncalled for.", "ESH\nShe should have been more considerate and not assumed people would cover for her getting more, but yeah, calling her fat was not nice. You can criticize her without criticizing her weight  because if she was skinny, doing the same thing would still be a jerk move. That being said, I don't know if she has an ED like BED, but I know what it's like to be a fat teenager, especially presenting as a girl, and it sucks. Shaming her won't make her eat less; in fact, it will make her double down because that's how people work. We are stubborn creatures. Also, I think the fact that another person started it, but you not only did nothing to stand up for her, but played along, probably really did hurt her. Insulting people for their looks is just mean spirited, and remember that even if you live with her (not sure you do), you don't know what's going on inside her head. BED is just as serious as restrictive disorders, and she could have something else going on like a thyroid or hormone problem. \nTl;dr: You both need to be more considerate. You need to apologize, and she needs to prepare before going out to eat so that she's not expecting others to cover for her.", "ESH\n\nYes, you should only pay for what you bought. But insulting and humiliating her makes you a much bigger AH. Sounds like these \"friends\" really bring out the absolute worst in you.", "I am confused. Why didn't everyone pay individually for the food if money and the transactional system were not an issue?  This whole situation sounds weird. Did you each order specific things or random things to share? Here's what I am getting at, when I was younger, I had some AH friends I thought could be friends with my other group of friends. The AHs thought the others didn't fit the mold for being my friend, but I disagreed and honestly thought we could all get along. I thought I was doing a good thing by creating a bridge between varying personalities. Unlike in your situation, they knew not to cross the line and be disrespectful when I was present. I was in my late 20s when a longtime friend informed me that those outings and social events were not what I stupidly perceived them to be. Instead, the AHs used those opportunities to belittle them when I stepped away, to get ammunition against them, and anything else to prove to them they did not belong. To this day, I don't understand why those three people remain my friend, especially since they never held me accountable. And yes, the AHs, including myself, should have been held responsible for the pain inflicted. \n\nYou are young, but you will soon learn that every innocent-funny-in-the-moment comment isn't what it seems. Unfortunately, you didn't get a chance to understand that before hurting your sister. By the way, the description of your sister in comparison to yourself and the \"whole lot more\" comment shows me that you are attempting to, in a sense, dehumanize her to make what happen any less awful. It is for that reason I would have to say YTA. I have a friend who is a size two and can out-eat most people and does it at every outing. She, too, will always insist that we split the check or tab equally. Yes, the entitlement is astounding, so I would have to say your sister is also an AH; if each of you ordered the items \"you\" were going to eat. We have learned over time to notify the server beforehand that the checks are separate. However, if, as a group, you all ordered random things and agreed to split the bill ahead of the gathering, no, she is not the AH. You all decided to split the check beforehand, and unfortunately, there will always be someone who eats or drinks less or more or chooses less or more expensive items. It is the nature of the beast when you agree to split the check.", "YTA. She shouldn\u2019t have expected for y\u2019all to pay more because she ordered more, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t have let your friends talk to her like that. If someone said that to one of my siblings I\u2019d tell em to fuck off. Dude.", "YTA and so is your friend.\n\nYou guys are cruel. You know you hurt her (she even told you that you did), and now you \"kinda\" feel bad? That's disturbing.", "Yes YTA.  Be better. Be kinder. You can get your point across without being mean", "ESH you don't need to say that to her but she can't expect other to pay for her food.", "ETA. People who want to split the bill equally when they've ordered much more than everyone else are assholes. But you didn't need to be nasty about her weight. She already knows she is fat. Make it about the amount she ordered vs what everyone else ordered, not about what she looks like.", "Gee.. what a nice sister. At some point how you behave is you as a person.. whether people need to wake up or not.. you made your sibling cry.. why are you even asking..", "YTA \n\nIt was unnecessary and cruel to comment on her weight. She is a 16 year old girl with all the insecurities a 16 year old girl has. You should know better.\n\nAnd to top it all off, you AND your friends taunted her in public. \n\nYou should have just paid for what you ordered and left it at that. If she had an issue with that, tell her to speak to her parents about it.\n\nAnd just so you know, people who are overweight, or have acne, or any other noticeable physical characteristic are already well aware.
