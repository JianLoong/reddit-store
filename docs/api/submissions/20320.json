We recently had a child and it has been amazing. Of course it takes up a lot of our time and energy but completely worth it. \n\nThrough out college an highschool i used to play basketball and wrestle competitively i was extremely good and loved both sports. After college i stopped and picked up the hobby of BJJ my wrestling foundation obviously gave me a huge a advantage and i started competing and doing very well. I picked up coaching for a bit of extra income and to offset the time spent training. 4ish hours per day 4 days a week 3 weekdays and one weekend day on top of a regular job. My wife didn't like it much but was supportive anyway. She doesn't really have any hobbies or many close friends.\n\nFast forward a few years and our son was born. I took a month of of BJJ to help out with the baby. I got a new job with better pay and a few days remote work. After a month i went back to training. It would occasionally come up that i spend to much time away but with her quitting her job to be a SAHM we decided to keep it as is. \nWithin a week or so of getting back into it I had a pretty rough shoulder injury. My competitive career is over but i continue coaching. 2 days week 8 hours on Saturdays and 4 hours on Wednesdays. I have no joy in it anymore but the money still helps.\n\nI started playing basket ball a couple hours once a week. The team i play for practices twice a week. Am i the asshole for wanting to play both days? I'm extremely extroverted and extremely competitive. Essentially all i do is work and don't have any other hobbies or social outlets. My wife is more introverted and would prefer i don't play at all but definitely doesn't want me to play 2 days per week.\n\nEdit : i don't want to continue coaching but she thinks we need the money and don't disagree but i think we would still be fine if i stopped.", "created_utc": 1687446421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g60aq/aita_for_spending_time_on_a_hobby_while_we_have_a/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you\u2019re practicing twice a week and do BJJ twice a week, that basically means your wife sees you on Sunday and the days you can\u2019t manage to find a reason to be away. You are putting the needs of your personality over those of your wife and child.", "This situation with your wife picking up the slack while you get to enjoy all your hobbies as though you were srill child free is totally unfair to your wife. YTA.", "Kind of. I think that\u2019s just a LOT of time to be away from home for a hobby and leavibg your wife woth the kid. Maybe you two can find a compromise on this", "YMBTA\n\nMy wife, who is a SAHM, explained it to me like this.  When I am at work, I interact with adults, regardless if they are coworkers or customers.  She, gets to hang out with a child, that is her focus and all of her attention (and rightly so) goes to our son.  \n\nYou work, you provide, you support BUT when you have days you have off, where you can relax. You are showing her you would much rather relax with the fellas, coaching, basketball pretty much ANYWHERE than be with her.\n\nYou may hear a lot of other opinions telling you different things but I can almost guarantee you they are not married or in a real relationship.", "Your wife doesn\u2019t have any social outlets or hobbies at all because she is taking care of your baby full time.

Sorry about your injury but it needs to be fair. YTA", "That's a lot of hours you're spending away from home for a hobby, Nothing to do with introvert/extrovert it's to do with the fact that it shouldn't just be about you  alone anymore. You can get back to it when your child/children are older", "YTA \n\nYou lose a whole day at the weekend to this and honestly it\u2019s just selfish, you have a wife and kid and you should be spending that time with them.", "YTA. It doesn't matter if you're gaming, playing basketball, hiking, or coaching BJJ. You are spending far too much time on your solo activities.", "You would cry if you would realize how incredibly fast the years go by and you will be sorry you didn't spend time with your kid. Think about how fast these 15 months have gone by, and the years will too. By the time you know, baby will be a 15yr old teenager that will want nothing to do with you, then an adult with a life away from you, and the only left would be what you built up with your child. I'm not going to say anything about the basketball because it is not taking you too much time away. But the other one is a different story  If you are doing for the money because she is now a shm, maybe should seat down with her and go through your finances and see if you really can afford for her not to work, take into consideration daycare is expensive. It may require you to live in a budget but your family life would be worth it.", "YTA...You spend a lot of time talking about yourself, but not much about your wife and child's needs.  This sounds like a lot of time away from home, and if she thinks it's too much, you have to consider that without dismissing her as an introvert.", "Soft YTA. You deserve and are entitled to *me time* away from the demands of family - but equally your family is your primary time and effort responsibility, and your wife is entitled to her own *me time*. You need to compromise. Make an effort to give her a regular break.", "YTA. You need to divide your time in such a manner that works for both you and your wife. She may be a SAHM but that is not all she is. Have you ever considered the possibility she has no hobbies because she has literally no time to? Child labour and household maintenance should always be 50-50.", ">i was extremely good  \n>  \n>I'm extremely extroverted and extremely competitive.\n\nYou sound extremely exhausting. That being said, if you don't want to coach anymore, then you and your wife need to have a serious conversation about your finances. On its own, four hours of basketball a week isn't a huge ask. But in combination with the BJJ, that ends up being a lot.", "YTA.\nAll I keep reading is excuses and it\u2019s about you you you. Time to yourself is important, but time for your wife to herself to choose as she likes regardless of being introverted (dude, not cool as an excuse) is equally important. Why does her introversion make her time to herself less important than yours? \nYou make money which can be made by anyone. She is doing the main caring of your child who only has 1 childhood.", "Unfortunately, parenthood--and especially early parenthood--comes with sacrifices, which often result in the pulling back of hobbies. I noticed you specifically asked if you would be TA if you went BOTH days, which leads me to believe your wife asked if you could cut it back to one night a week, which seems like a more than reasonable compromise.", "YTA honestly. You don\u2019t give her a break. Also, you are not spending time with your child. This is not a good thing you are doing.  You know you are wrong that\u2019s why you came here seeking someone to ease your guilt.", "Info I think there is a compromise here. The Bjj thing is a second job that you no longer want.   Your wife wants you home more.\n\nSo you quit the bjj and spend that time at home. Yes i know your wife doesnt want to lose the income. Thats what makes it a compromise.  She has to weigh the income vs the time.", "What activities does your wife enjoy, for time away, and for time for herself? \n\nBecause you didn't mention any..\n\nYTA", "NTA. It's 4 hours.

Also, clearly states that wife doesn't want to work but wants the income from his second job to continue.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, just need to let your wife have her time away as well, if you spend 6 hours or so a week away for yourself, she should have the same luxury. Being at home all the time alone with a newborn is no picnic. I\u2019m sure it will make both of your lives easier if she had her own time as well.", "NAH - yet. It seems like you spend a lot of time in sports. The question is, what's too much? This is something that you and your wife need to communicate on. There is no absolute answer; it's what you both end up comfortable with.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if you ended up cutting back, but just *communicate* so that you end up with something both of you agree is reasonable. This post is actually pre-conflict as you don't know whether or not your wife is actually fine with what you're doing.", "YTA but I give up on you. You just keep arguing in every comment how it\u2019s not a big deal to spend even more time away from home where you could be bonding and parenting your child and supporting your wife who is still fucking healing and doing all the work herself for hours every week.", "YTA - so you want to be out of the house 3 nights a week and all day on Saturday? \n\nNo. Just no. \n\nYou're a husband first, dad second, and breadwinner third. Everything else comes AFTER those three responsibilities are met. It really sounds like you've abandoned your two most important roles in favor of hanging with the guys playing sports. \n\nIt's time to get your priorities in order and you'd better do it before your wife decides that since she's already a single parent she doesn't actually need you.", "NTA. \n\nAll you do is work, take care of baby\u2026 and carve out two hours a week to play basketball.

Even if you were still playing recreationally you should be allowed to do that. Having a baby shouldn\u2019t mean you have to give up the things you care about for either of you", "NAH. Looks like most commenters are jumping to conclusions and assuming you\u2019re trying to get out of spending time with your kid, which is obviously not the case. You deserve alone time each week to recharge or you\u2019ll burn out, and you\u2019re clearly putting in the hours at home on the other days. But your wife is worried about money, which can\u2019t be fun on top of everything else she is dealing with. The big sticking point seems to be your coaching day - is there a way you can take a few months off to see how you manage without the extra income, and spend that day at home instead? It might give her an excuse to find a hobby of her own to do on that day, or even a side hustle she could do to bring in the extra income she\u2019d be missing. No one is an AH in this situation you guys just need to sit down and hash out a compromise.", "ESH (bordering NTA, but I'm biased because I do BJJ).\n\nIf for you to live comfortably, you need to coach BJJ - it isn't really a hobby. It's a job. My coaches work, and run an academy on top, and it is not easy.\n\nYou need to find ways to work around the schedule. Personally, I think 4h a week isn't much for a hobby, and your wife might be a little upset because she does not have an outlet - but imo, it's not your fault.\n\nTell your wife that BJJ is your job, and if she wants to keep the same lifestyle as now, you will have to continue to do it. You need time to de-load, and those 4h dedicated to your hobby will put you in a much better mindset.\n\nI trained as a Judoka for 10+ years, and last 3 or so were torture, as I hated the sport and did it out of guilt (I felt  like I wasted all those years, and only quit when I realised I dreaded days when sessions were on... I did find BJJ which sparked new joy into martial arts for me). If I had to do Judo for a job, at the time (I was way too young, so this is hypothetical), I would be absolutely miserable, even if it paid decently.\n\nFind ways to compromise with your wife, maybe drive out further or find a different club where you can play early mornings, or some other time that fits your schedule. \n\nLife is hard dude, gotta keep your wife happy", "NTA. \n\nAll you do is work, take care of baby\u2026 and carve out two hours a week to play basketball.

I have a baby and it's hard to have free time and money.  You and wife need to run the budget and the family schedule again and decide what the solution will be and both agree on it.  Get creative.  Can someone else watch baby while you're at basketball, can baby come along while you're coaching, can something else give in the budget to reduce your coaching hours?  \n\nI understand your wife's point of view and being a SAHP is tough, but you can't let yourself get burnt out, either.", "NTA. You\u2019re the one bringing in money, and BJJ is a second job. As long as she gets to time do things she wants (which doesn\u2019t sound like she can be bothered with?) then it\u2019s very healthy to have a few hours to yourself over the course of a week.

You justify the extra hobby time by saying she doesn't have friends or hobbies. But if you\u2019re working or just gone most of the time, when is she supposed to develop those? When does she get the time off to even think about a hobby she might want to do?", "Right, but if you don't want to be doing the coaching and she feels like you're out of the house too much, then clearly there's a problem!", "Is your wife happy?

What did she do in her free time before the baby was here while you spent 18 hours a week at BJJ? That\u2019s what she should get back to and you need to insist on it. \n\nAssuming that she loves you, she probably sees that you work 40 hours a week, then work more at BJJ, and come home and takes care of the baby and she probably feels guilty asking for a break, especially if she likes being a stay at home mom! She feels guilty because she is doing the job she wants and because of that she wants to make things easier on you, but if her entire life is dedicated to caring for the baby, she\u2019s going to burn out or get depressed. \n\nIt\u2019s important for her well-being to get a break and I really think you need to insist on carving out time for her. If you play basketball each Wednesday night for 2 hours (plus time getting ready and driving to/from) then insist that you are on baby duty for the same amount of time on Thursday nights - book her a nail appointment or help her find a book club or running club or set her up in the bedroom with Netflix and wine and you care for the baby downstairs; whatever she liked before the baby and set it in stone the same as your basketball schedule so she can look forward to it and plan time. Then carve out every Friday for date night after the kiddo is bed, it sounds like your whole world has become about the baby and working and I think she might do well with dedicated adult couple time and dedicated alone/social time.", "You are still the asshole.", "How could she possibly take you up on it? With the schedule you describe there literally isn\u2019t enough time in the week when you\u2019re home.", "Ok, I would go with NTA based on that, as I presumed you were arguing. \n\nYour partner may be unhappy, but you need to communicate and make sure she understands that this is what you need.\n\nHonestly, grappling is tough as Fu** man, I love it and half the time, I don't want to do it because everything hurts and is sore.\n\n My gf didn't really understand when I said 'im sore everywhere\" as an excuse to not doing something physical, but after seeing my first competition, and trying out a few no-gi classes, she totally gets it\ud83e\udd23\n\nIdk how you run your academy, but our coaches roll, and we have scrappy dudes that are out to get you. If you are already not enjoying the sport, having to coach out of need, and then have to roll with someone who's trying to take your head off - you have a quick ticket to burn out town.\n\nBurn out with no outlet = depression.\n\nDon't get depressed sir.", "Are you going to have her read this?  It sounds like you're feeling guilty and making an assumption about what she's not saying.  Maybe just clear the air.\n\nYou said she's introverted.  It sounds like she doesn't want an outside outlet, she wants you to have more free time.  You as an extrovert want to spend your free time outside of the house.  I get it, the two of you need a compromise and you need to trust each other that \"fine\" and \"perfectly happy with 2 jobs\" are honest statements.", "Please tell us more about what you know of his circumstances.. \ud83d\ude44", "I'm very lucky with my job so when I'm remote i rarely put in more than a few hours a day.", "Honestly no idea. I feel like most people are misunderstanding our situation or intentionally misconstruing based on their own biases", "Bc he\u2019s lying about the situation. He\u2019s saying different things in his post and comments to try and argue he\u2019s not the asshole after people telling him he is", "Cause Reddit", "Those are great suggestions and I'll check it out. It's tough because getting her to do social things is a struggle even though she usually enjoys them.", "I spend most of my time at home . Most days are remote and those days i only \"work\" for a maximum 4 hours. The rest of them i am there to help. Wednesdays are the only hard ones because I'm in the office and then coach for 4 hours in the evenings", "I do want to help and i do help there is no issue with child care from me. I'm saying I'd rather be spending time with my wife and caring for our son than working.", "The BJJ is a job now i just coach and don't train. I'd rather drop it but for her to be a SAHM which she wants i have to continue.", "He's working two jobs, that's literally all for her benefit.", "She wanted really badly to be a SAHM. I'm happy to support her and our family. I don't enjoy working but do so for her. She is not comfortable with me quitting coaching and living on a tighter Budget nor does she want to go back to work.", "Like i have mentioned i offer her all the time to take the baby for anything she wants to do even if it's to just leave the house and go shopping. That's open offer in all of my free time.", ">You justify the extra hobby time by saying she doesn't have friends or hobbies.\n\nThat's not my justification. That's really her justification for never taking me up on the offer to take care of our son. She has an open offer to do whatever she likes when I'm not doing my full-time job I've even told her I can cancel coaching here and there if there is a conflict. She's not the type to just sit and binge Netflix or take a long bath. I definitely take the lead on child care when I'm home so she can relax", "Babies sleep a lot. She has plenty of time.", "There's isn't a fight or anything i know she doesn't like it but she says it's \"fine\".\nI just want to get outside perspectivea", "As a teacher she had kind of long hours plus running after school activities for kids. \nWhen we both go home we were pretty beat usually we would just cook dinner work out and go to bed or watch a little TV maybe see some friends.\n\nWe are both honestly happy our son has been a huge blessing and we talk about how much better our lives are often. The only big change recently was something that used to be a very rewarding jobby for me has now turned into a non rewarding second job. \n\nI think you are right she definitely could feel guilty to ask for a break because we both work hard. I think I'm going to plan a day out for her and her mother while i stay home with out son.", "I tell her besides my full time job all my free time is up for grabs and i can cancel coaching and basketball here and there if it's a conflict.", "I do very light stuff now and technical for demonstration. Most of my athletes are younger and all are aware my left shoulder is bad. \n\n>Burn out with no outlet = depression.\n\n>Don't get depressed sir.\n\nWill do!", "Sorry you don't see the figures don't add up. If they did, why would they be posting here asking?", "Does she enjoy reading to your son? Because volunteering to read at story time in the local library might be a good way to get her out and active.", "So you\u2019ve gone from \u201call I do is work\u201d to \u201cI only work 4 hours\u201d while still admitting that Wednesday\u2019s you work all day and then coach for 4 hours\n\nYou do not sound like a reliable narrator", "When exactly do you have time to help if you work full-time,  coach 1,5 days and play basketball?", "Then why not do it? Do it.", "But it's still time you are not home, not with your wife, and not with your child.", "I'm changing to hard YTA. Keep doing what you're doing until she's a SAHM and you're a some other home ex dad.", "Have you tried just actively taking care of your baby solo for a while, rather than expecting her to ask you to do so? Framing it as an offer to take the baby when she wants to do something puts her in the position of default carer, when you should be 50/50, and for whatever reason she may not feel comfortable asking. My suggestion would be to tell her you've got the baby for a couple of hours, so she doesn't have to worry and can relax and do whatever she wants in that time", "I understand that. And my perspective is that you having to take on a part-time job that you don't like because she's unwilling to work and also unwilling to live on a tighter budget is a problem.", "You have spoken.", "What doesn't add up to you?", "I understood what he said perfectly, why attack him when youre the one not reading or understanding what he says?", "Most of my days are remote. Those days of the 8 i work i really only spend a maximum of 4 working the rest are with my son and wife. I'm lucky with my job where i can be on the clock but still be there to help out around the house. Once I'm off the clock I'm all theirs. Saturdays and Wednesday are the only days I'm out of the house working for an extended period of time. To be clear my wife doesn't feel like i don't pick up my fair share of house work or child care.\n\nMy real question is is 2(current) to 4(hypothetical)hrs too much to spend on me time as a parent?", "If she wants him to work an extra job she has to be okay with him having hobbies.", "Yeah but that's how jobs work. I would much rather be a stay at home parent as would she. She's made it clear that she doesn't want to go back to work and I'm happy to support her even if it means working an extra job. With remote work days i still get tro spend more time with her then if i just worked full time in the office with no extra job", "When i am not working i Actively take care of our son. She then has time to decompress and relax. I think she doesn't leave the house because she'd rather watch Netflix online shop or work on her puzzles. I mentioned that as an offer because i don't want her to feel like she is stuck inside. I mentioned she is very introverted to show why she may prefer those types of decompression over something away from the home.", "Well there's a passive aggressive response. Truth hurts?", "It's a quote from the Mandalorian."]}
