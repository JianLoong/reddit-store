You did your required jobs so your brother can do his.  Your parents have created this situation all by themselves and it is non of your extended families business so they can keep their noses out.  Moving out is probably the best and I definitely would not go back to living with them.

Their reasoning is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nLooks like your family - including your extended family EXCEPT Grandma - makes you the scapegoat for everything. Continue to stay with your friend.\n\nDon't bother trying to discuss or explain anything to your parents or any other hecklers. They have ZERO interest in what's logical, fair, right, etc. Go as low contact with them as you can.\n\n1. All the logic you shared that they rejected is clear proof of that.\n2. You are NOT adding any stress to your parents or brother. If you - on your own - can hold down a job, take care of yourself and your things; then surely three of them can manage to work together to take care of themselves and their things. If they cannot, that is NOT your problem. Your job right now is to build your future; it was never to be the caretaker or punching bag of any of them.\n\nGood wishes to you as you go about building your life and leaving a poor pair of parents and brother to their own devices.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are angry their cleaning fairy up & left. You were doing twice as many chores as your brother.
