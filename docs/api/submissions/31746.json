Alice doesn't have a license so she navigated and would therefore stay in the front seat.\n\n\nThat's where the problem arose, Alice suddenly put her legs on the dashboard, I asked if she could please sit down normally. She didn't understand that because \"this won't bother you, will it?\" I tried to explain what happens when you have an accident sitting like that and that I didn't want to be responsible for that. Alice thought I was joking so started laughing. I stopped at a gas station to continue talking. After a while she angrily said that she would sit normally again but she still didn't understand the problem. Grace and Alice then went to the gas station to get something. I stayed at the car.\n\n\nAt the toilet a little later I overheard Grace say \"I think it's nonsense too, but you know how she can be, when she's sleeping you can just sit like that\". When they came back I said that I wanted Alice only in the back of the car. This turned into an argument again. I did not say that I heard their conversation, I didn't feel like that. \n\n\nBecause Alice kept refusing to sit in the back, I called the hotel to cancel. This made them both very angry and they took all their stuff and called an Uber. I drove myself back home. At home I noticed a lot of messages and missed calls from mutual friends and family saying some unkind things. Alice had made a post on social media about what a terrible friend I am. I saw that they went camping before they blocked me.\n\n\n\nI thought this would be for the best, I did not want her to be folded up like a pretzel in an accident and lose her legs. It's my car so my rules and my responsibility if something goes wrong. But many friends and family think I exaggerated and perhaps I shouldn't have reacted that way.

It's even more dangerous than I thought, so I stand by that decision.", "Thank you, it means a lot that you say I'm a good friend, because right now I'm really doubting that. I certainly don't expect we would get into an accident. I drive pretty well (though I say so myself) and as safely as possible. I have never had an accident in the four years that I have had my driving license.

I do know they took a picture in a tent right before I got blocked so I'm assuming they're camping now. \n\nStill, I might have done better if I could have arranged to get my share of the deposit back for the hotel and they could have gone together, but I didn't think about that at the time. They might have been able to get to the hotel if they could arrange an Uber for the entire stretch or several Ubers for parts of the entire road. But that would probably have become much more expensive.\n\nI'll give all those angry friends and family a few days to cool off and then try to tell them my side of the story.

I haven't seen it yet and I don't know if I want to see it either. I really hope that never happened in real life.", "Thanks, this made me chuckle.

But it's enough that some friends and family are angry with me now. I'll give them a few days to cool off and then try to tell them my side of the story. Fortunately, my roommate understands me completely, and I now also use his second Reddit account for this.", "I am sorry I don't know what 'iw' means?", "Thank you for your response. I do indeed think that in hindsight I should not have canceled the hotel. I should have asked if I could get my money back and that they could still go together. Unfortunately I didn't think about that at the time. As soon as they no longer block me, I would also like to apologize for that.", "Friends that needed losing.

Technically she was wearing the seat belt, but I don't think it was of much use that way.", "The state I live in has the same law!", "You don't appreciate their judgement and they obviously need to see it to knock some sense into them at the very least the ones who where in the car with you need to see it, the others don't need to see it unless they are still not understanding your side after you explain to them", "Spent a few years working a rehab and nursing home, unfortunately saw way too much of this sort of thing from younger patients. They all said the same thing, \"I never thought it would happen to me!\" We had a saying there, \"At least you're alive to regret your decisions.\"", "I also have a motorcycle driver's license, so I also feel that I pay a little more attention to the road and what dangers there may be. Because I know things can go very wrong", "It was really intense, not only did they have to deliver/save a baby in a crushed car, but also rescue the mother and prevent death or paralysis. I can't remember what happened but the doc felt so guilty. But even in reality, if the passenger has their legs in this position they're guaranteed to fall to either paralysis/death, that is a fact.\nStick to your guns, you're not only guaranteeing their safety but yours as well, especially legally.", "I'm glad I made you chuckle.

That's why I suggested stopping more often along the way to walk and so on. But I still don't understand why she had to sit that way.", "Oh thank you, I was not aware of that. I thought it might have been easily changed.", "Thank you, it would have been great if I was able to negotiate in that situation but indeed we were all too emotional for that.", "I agree with you, unfortunatly they both blocked me so I can not send them anything. Will give them time to cool off, maybe then they won't block me anymore. If not well that that is what it is.", "Thats a great saying, although I can also imagine that some people get mad if you say that. I personally use something like \"at least now you know not to do that again\". \nBut it is certainly true, people often think that those kind of things can never happen to them, that it only happens to others or that they only see it on the news.", "You know they\u2019re called \u201cdonor cycles\u201d right? \n\nWeird you\u2019re that concerned with how she\u2019s sitting when you\u2019re willing to get on / drive a motor cycle.

Your car, your rules.", "NTA your car, your rules, you're not exaggerating the danger there!", "Alice is an adult.\nShe was informed of the risks and accepted them. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "That'll surely help OP's soon-to-be-non-existent social life! \n\nReading between the lines, OP is insufferable, and I'm guessing her 'friends' only went with her bc she was providing transportation. \n\nSometimes, being right isn't worth it.", "Thank you! Fortunately I have plenty of other friends, in the meantime a number of them have already taken my side because they don't believe what Grace and Alice had posted and asked me my side of the story.", "Thanks and oh no, I'm so sorry that that happened to your family member. I hope they are doing well despite those circumstances.", "Thank you, I just had to laugh out loud at how frustrated you seem to be at the mere thought of someone doing that with their 'stank ass feet' to your car. Love it :)", "Thanks, luckily I have some 'better' friends too :)\nMost have now heard my side of the story and seem to agree with it. I'm really glad about that.", "I'm so sorry you had to see that. That must have been very awfull and gross to see, I really hope it doesn't bother you much anymore. And thank you for agreeing.", "Thanks, and haha \u200b\u200bno I don't think her parents were like that. I only really know her mother and she can easily overlook any mistake her daughter makes.", "Thank you, I didn't expect any problems on advance, but after this happened I didn't want to know what other problems there could be.", "Thank you, I'm going to focus less on them after this and more on the other great friends I have, including my roommate who is really fantastic.", "Thank you, of all people, I can imagine that you as an EMT are very strict about this, you are the first to see what the consequences can be.", "Thank you, I want to give my side of the story to all the friends and family they involved after posting some unfriendly stuff about me on social media. Fortunately, most of my friends and some family members have already asked me what my side of the story is and luckily most of them now understand my choice. \nI hope this explains it better?", "Thanks for responding, I understand what you're saying. but I didn't do this because in my opinion if they plan to do it behind my back even though I had already explained my view, there is no point in discussing it any further. It would not have changed anything. \nThen I also gave an choice, either get in the back of the car or I would cancel the hotel. In retrospect, perhaps I should have handled the cancellation differently, but my emotions were to high to negotiate further.", "Thanks for responding, I didn't talk about what I overheard because in my opinion if they plan to do it behind my back even though I had already explained everything, there is no point in discussing it any further. \nBefore I overheard it I had already briefly said that I would prefer if, since she was being so strange about it, she sat in the back. We agreed to talk about that more after they had gotten something to eat and I could think for a moment. But after hearing that, further discussion no longer seemed an option to me\n\nI do understand your point, how that can seem quite strange and maybe controlling to them. On the other hand, they may have even realized that I heard them because of how angry I was afterwards. But it may have made the argument worse.", "Thanks for responding, it would have been my problem since it would have happend in my car. So my responsibility and my insurance. She is indeed an adult with her own autonomy, but so am I.", "A number of friends and family members of mine who also follow them on social media. They also tagged me in some of those things so it ended up on my page too. And in the same way also a number of their family members.\nFortunately, most of my friends and some family members have already asked me what my side of the story is. and luckily most of them now understand my choice.", "Thank you for your response, I just think that it would have been a problem for me if an accident did happen, because it would then be my responsibility and my insurance. I only canceled it because it was in my name and after I had already said I would do it if she didn't sit in the back of the car instead of the front. She refused to sit in the back of the car so I told them they could continue without me and they decided to do so and get an Uber.", "Thank you. I did make it clear that I was going to call to cancel if she didn't sit in the back of my car. Like: get in the back or I'm not driving futher, since I do not trust you won't do it again. Since the hotel was also in my name, that was possible, but they both thought I was bluffing. Since it was in my name I was the only one that could do so. \n\nBut I stand by my decision that she wasn't allowed to sit in my car like that, because that can be very dangerous.\n\nFortunately a number of them have now taken my side because they don't believe what Grace and Alice had posted and so they asked me my side of the story. The rest I will give some time to cool off.", "Thank you, glad more people agree with me. Makes me feel better about what happend.", "Thanks, well of all things that could have happened, I did not expect this. I have done a few group travels and road trips before (with other friends) and they went well. We also agreed well in advance what we wanted to do and where we wanted to go, so I did not expect many problems.", "Thanks, glad you agree!", "Oh my, I am so sorry that happend to your mom. I hope she is doing well despite all that? And I hope you did not see it?", "What?! I think it would be the other way around! Plus all you have to do to keep your feet awake is to move them a bit every once in awhile. She is reaching for excuses and being rude and entitled.", "I can understand the frustration having done a lot of sitting while traveling this year, but its not cool of the passenger to make it the driver's problem. \n\nI got this this year, and it's been a game changer. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0791MD9R2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nBut I'm also short, so that might be why I benefit so much from it.", "She has he shoes on?!!! Wtf. That's just rude. Like putting your shoes on the coffee table.", "To be fair I also like to drive like this. In my car. Just with my husband. I know it us dangerous. Did I do it in any other car? Hell no. That is just disrespectful. Your car, your rules. Nta", "Regardless of insurance liability, her family makes it your liability when they try to sue you because it was your car and your negligence if you were the one driving. \n\nYou also called off the trip when it was still possible for them to get home conveniently even if it cost them some money. You returned their money immediately. \n\nYour car, your rules. All you need to respond to the people harassing you is \u201cI cared more about Alice\u2019s safety than being a chill driver\u201d and block everyone. Who knows what story they heard, but it likely is how you\u2019re over dramatic and controlling. Texting back pictures of horrible X-rays or accident injuries will make people really defensive and bluster about how that won\u2019t happen if you\u2019re a good driver or whatever. Nope, you care more about your friend\u2019s safety even when she is being the ultimate passenger princess than your trip.", "Make a little comment on the link \u201cI sorry Alice for my concerns of your health it will never happen again I hope you have a nice vacation and a good life! Don\u2019t call me\u201d", "Thanks for responding. I am sorry for coming across like that. \n\nFortunately I have plenty of other friends, in the meantime a number of them have already taken my side because they don't believe what Grace and Alice had posted so they asked about my side of the story. My roommate is also a huge help in this all.", "Nope. You did right. They would have never paid you back.", "They might not be laughing so much if they saw those xrays.", ":D  Glad I could give you a laugh!  I have serious germ issues and people filthing up my space...lol.  You seem like a genuinely lovely person and good friend, you don't need people like that in your life.", "A lot of us want a backbone like yours.\n\nI mean it. You've got the chops to be a first responder - if up for the danger :)", "It doesn't thankfully..... but it's made me more aware of my own responsibilities as a druver in regards to car safety.\n\nMy car, my rules.... and I agree with your rules...\n\nI will not drive the car unless my passengers use their seatbelts and keep their feet on the floor. Failure to comply means \"Sorry Mate, you're walking\"", "I hope you understand different people take different risks. Some of your friends will make different decisions than you and, if they are truly friends, it\u2019s not about judging them.\nYou will have to compromise to get along in this world.", "Luckily I wasn't there for that one. She had to have  a lot of physical therapy and couldn't walk for like 8 months or something like that. But she's doing ok now. It hurts her some days but it's an older injury.", "They probably wouldn't have given you your money back. They can book their own hotel. Good on you for not being a pushover.", "Yeah, it didn't make sense to me either", "That is very useful, thank you! I will get that and just put it in my car as standard. You never know who will need it one day.\n\nI had suggested to stop more often so that she could stretch her legs and she also had a little more leg room in the back of the car. but she disagreed with both. I'm not sure if that was really the reason she did that either. \n\nDoes it also help for you to stop to stretch your legs?", "She does that too :)", "I mean, if it is your own car and your husband is okay with it. Then it is your own choice and your own risk and no one else's.", "Thanks!", "Yeah, I don't really know her family that well but chances are they would have done that. And thanks, thats also why I am giving most of them some time to cool off. Everything I say now won't be accepted, so I hope that when people are less emotional they will listen to my side of the story.", "Perhaps not no. I might know if they unblock me.", "Oh I definitely understand what you mean. I cleaned the dashboard thoroughly a few hours ago. And thank you, that really means a lot to me. Hope you have an amazing day :)", "That's really sweet of you, thank you! \nI'm not fantastic with big wounds and everything so I don't think I can :)", "Good thing you stick to those rules! You have every reason to do so. And glad to hear that it doesn't bother you much anymore. It makes sense that this makes you think more about your safety (and responsibilities) and that of others.", "Oh boy that sounds like a long process. Glad to hear that you weren't there and therefore didn't see it, I think that would have made the situation even more intense. Also nice to hear that she is doing better now!", "I'm not sure if they would have given it back or not, but they got their money back from me. So that has been taken care of and if they want they could book something else with that money. Thanks!", "Oh yea for sure. Though some people have childhood trauma from stopping too much. Our boomer and Gen X parents were annoyed that children had bladders. \n\nI have done a couple road trips with my boyfriend recently, and it was a blessing in disguise that our car has a small tank, so we'd have to stop every 3 or so hours (I'm sure we could have pushed it further, but we'd need to pee and want snacks at that interval anyway).", "[deleted]", "I know, and this is totally fine. I drive also long hours with friends. I usually ask if it is OK to take of my shoes, and to have my legs criss crossed. So I have enough movement and different positions to feel well.\n\nNever would I think of putting my feet on any other persons board.\n\nJust wanted to make this boundary clear :)", "Stand strong in being NTA, u/Mean_Library_6857 Stick to your one response and then don\u2019t engage further. If everyone hears the same thing from you every time they bring it up, they will stop bringing it up because you\u2019re boring. If you need a response about Grace, it\u2019s the same thing. \u201cI put the safety of my friends before being \u201cchill\u201d. Fuck me, right?\u201d Be boring and people will leave you alone eventually. With some thought and when they\u2019re not being stirred up by your mutual garbage people some will come to understand you\u2019re in the right and the rest are t worth your time, attention, or energy. Block whoever you need to for now. You did the right thing both for you and your hopefully ex friends.", "Hopefully they won\u2019t because the three of you are incompatible.", "I don't really get it either. OP is allowed, it's their car, but it's a little odd to take such a huge risk but get all high and mighty about another adult taking a risk. Don't get me wrong the friend sitting like that is fucking stupid, but OP is not morally responsible for what adults do while OP is sleeping.", "I like people shaped people and snack shaped pretzels", "Oh wow I didn't see that coming, didn't even know he had made such a film. Love Tarantino movies tho.", "Thank you", "Oh I hadn't thought about the fact that people could have that, good to know!\nAnd that is indeed quite useful, I hope you enjoyed those road trips with your boyfriend!", "Thank you, luckily I have those too :)", "Sounds good! You sound like a great passenger and person :) \n\nI also often ask (when I don't have to drive) if I can take off my shoes on long car journeys, sometimes it feels a little more comfortable especially if you are wearing heels. \nIn my own car I always have a pair of sneakers (for when I have to drive and am not wearing safe shoes to drive in, such as heels) and slippers (if I don't have to drive) in the trunk.", "Thank you, this means a lot :)", "Exactly!", "It's part of a double feature called \"Grindhouse\"\n\nPlanet Terror by Robert Rodriguez\n\nDeath Proof by Quentin Tarantino\n\nThey are both absolutely unhinged. I had the movie poster in college.", "You sound like a fantastic friend, don't let these people get you down. And if you're in the midwest, I'd love another friend who loves road trips.", "I hadn't heard that before \n\nThanks", "Thats awesome, might watch them next movie night!", "That means a lot, thank you! Unfortunately I'm not in that region, but it sounds like that could have been fun :)"]}
