On phone. \n\nTwo friends, Grace and Alice, and I would go on a week-long road trip. We took my car and the plan was to mostly camp (first and last night in a hotel). Grace and I would alternate driving, so the other could rest or nap when necessary. Alice doesn't have a license so she navigated and would therefore stay in the front seat.\n\n\nThat's where the problem arose, Alice suddenly put her legs on the dashboard, I asked if she could please sit down normally. She didn't understand that because \"this won't bother you, will it?\" I tried to explain what happens when you have an accident sitting like that and that I didn't want to be responsible for that. Alice thought I was joking so started laughing. I stopped at a gas station to continue talking. After a while she angrily said that she would sit normally again but she still didn't understand the problem. Grace and Alice then went to the gas station to get something. I stayed at the car.\n\n\nAt the toilet a little later I overheard Grace say \"I think it's nonsense too, but you know how she can be, when she's sleeping you can just sit like that\". When they came back I said that I wanted Alice only in the back of the car. This turned into an argument again. I did not say that I heard their conversation, I didn't feel like that. \n\n\nBecause Alice kept refusing to sit in the back, I called the hotel to cancel. This made them both very angry and they took all their stuff and called an Uber. I drove myself back home. At home I noticed a lot of messages and missed calls from mutual friends and family saying some unkind things. Alice had made a post on social media about what a terrible friend I am. I saw that they went camping before they blocked me.\n\n\n\nI thought this would be for the best, I did not want her to be folded up like a pretzel in an accident and lose her legs. It's my car so my rules and my responsibility if something goes wrong. But many friends and family think I exaggerated and perhaps I shouldn't have reacted that way. Maybe I shouldn't have canceled the hotel and gone home.\nAm I the asshole for cancelling and going home?

The logical thing is to cancel the trip because you already paid for it.  If you didn't cancel and those two didn't make it to the destination, you (including friends) would have lost even more money.\n\nFor those who are saying you are wrong, steer clear from them at all cost because they do NOT understand the concept of being safe to themselves and others and life is too short to waste time on them, lol.", "NTA. It's your car, and you're driving. She needs to respect your rules and your property. And they were being the AHs talking behind your back and planning to break your rule while you slept. How can you trust friends like that? Especially when this was all born from a legit concern over her safety in the first place. You can find better friends than that.", "Absolutely NTA, not even a bit. There is an episode Grey's Anatomy where this exact thing happened to a pregnant woman, she was in labour in the passenger seat and the doctor (I think) who was driving, told her to put her legs on the dash, then the accident. Find this episode and post it to everyone who thinks you're wrong!", "NTA, Alice is really out here playing Final Destination. I have the same rule with my car really.

I suggested stopping the car more often to stretch her legs, but that wouldn't help, she said.", "Thanks, and yes I don't think her shoes were clean. I hadn't even thought about that. I'm going to clean it in a few.", "Thank you, I had indeed booked the hotel under my name. I had also paid in advance, which fortunately I now got back. I just transferred what Grace and Alice had paid for it back to them. \n\nBut maybe it would have been better if I hadn't canceled it. Due to all the frustration at that moment, I forgot to ask if it could also be adjusted to 2 people, so that I could get part of my money back and they could go together. That might have been better.", "Thank you, what frustrated me most was that they were laughing in that toilet about how ridiculous I was being and that they still wanted to do it behind my back. \nThe uber was their idea, I wanted to go home and they refused to get back in my car with me. In the end they decided to go camping together. Since they still had most of the camping gear with them.", "Besides, they should have their seat belts on and she would have to sit normally. Its a law in Connecticut, click it or ticket.  They stop cars on the roads here for people not wearing a seat belt", "Thank you, to be completely honest, I don't know exactly what responsibility and compensation apply when a passenger is injured in my car. but I assume that I am then liable because it is my car and therefore my insurance. So I didn't want to take the risk. Her seat belt was indeed in a very strange position to be able to sit like that, I didn't agree with that either.", "Look up what happens when you have your feet up on the dashboatd and click on images.  Make a link to your fb page.  It is chilling to look at these images", "Thank you and oh dear, I knew it couldn't turn out well, but that's more intense than I thought. I don't know if friends and family will appreciate it if I forward that. For now I'll leave that as it is, so the emotions can subside a bit. but I do plan to give them my side of the story in a few days.", "Thank you, the flying monkeys part made me laugh very hard. I'll give them all a few days to cool off and then try to tell them my side of the story. That website might be very helpfull, thank you. Fortunately, my roommate understands me completely.", "Thank you, I still stand by that decision. I just think now that I didn't handle that hotel quite right. I shouldn't have canceled it, but should have seen if I could adjust it to 2 people. Then I might have gotten my money back and they could still have gone.", "Thanks, I just googled those xrays that another reddit person was talking about. It's even more dangerous than I thought, so I stand by that decision.", "Thank you, it means a lot that you say I'm a good friend, because right now I'm really doubting that. I certainly don't expect we would get into an accident. I drive pretty well (though I say so myself) and as safely as possible. I have never had an accident in the four years that I have had my driving license. But of course an accident can happen so I just didn't want to take the risk", "Thank you, unfortunately, they both apparently still think it is very normal to sit like this in a car. \n\nThey have now both blocked me so I have no idea what they are going to do for the rest of the week. I do know they took a picture in a tent right before I got blocked so I'm assuming they're camping now. \n\nStill, I might have done better if I could have arranged to get my share of the deposit back for the hotel and they could have gone together, but I didn't think about that at the time. They might have been able to get to the hotel if they could arrange an Uber for the entire stretch or several Ubers for parts of the entire road. But that would probably have become much more expensive.\n\nI'll give all those angry friends and family a few days to cool off and then try to tell them my side of the story. Fortunately, my roommate understands me completely.", "Thank you, what frustrated me most was that they were laughing in that toilet about how ridiculous I was being and that they still wanted to do it behind my back. It made me not trust her enough to sit in the front seat of the car again.", "Thanks you, oh gosh that episode sounds really intense. I haven't seen it yet and I don't know if I want to see it either. I really hope that never happened in real life.", "Thanks, this made me chuckle. And that chance is indeed small, but I will also stick to that rule. Glad to hear others have the same rule in their car.", "Thanks, I'll give them all a few days to cool off and then try to tell them my side of the story. If they really don't believe it, I might send them a link or photo of xrays and stories of people who have had it happen to them. Fortunately, my roommate understands me completely.", "Thanks, I'm not sure she would do that, I don't think she has that much courage. To me she said that otherwise her legs would fall asleep and the only way to prevent that was to keep them up. And apparently it's very easy to go behind my back.", "Thank you.\nGreat reddit name btw.", "Thank you, I'll give all the angry friends and family a few days to cool off and then try to tell them my side of the story. I might post it on the same social media for them all to see, but I do not know if that will make it worse.

I should have asked if I could get my money back and I should have arranged that they could still go together. Unfortunately I didn't think about that at the time.\n\nI did make it clear that I was going to call to cancel if she didn't sit in the back of my car. Since the hotel was also in my name, that was possible, but they both thought I was bluffing.\n\nBut I stand by my decision that she wasn't allowed to sit in my car like that, because that can be very dangerous.\n\nUnfortunately, I have no idea what else they posted on social media, as they both blocked me fairly quickly. But it's enough that some friends and family are angry with me now. I'll give them a few days to cool off and then try to tell them my side of the story. Fortunately, my roommate understands me completely, and I now also use his second Reddit account for this.", "I am sorry I don't know what 'iw' means?", "Thank you for your response. I do indeed think that in hindsight I should not have canceled the hotel. I should have asked if I could get my money back and that they could still go together. Unfortunately I didn't think about that at the time. As soon as they no longer block me, I would also like to apologize for that.", "Friends that needed losing. If a driver had come up the road the wrong way and hit them head on, the friends injuries would have been catastrophic, more so than if she'd been sat with her legs down.

Technically she was wearing the seat belt, but I don't think it was of much use that way.", "The state I live in has the same law!", "You don't appreciate their judgement and they obviously need to see it to knock some sense into them at the very least the ones who where in the car with you need to see it, the others don't need to see it unless they are still not understanding your side after you explain to them", "Spent a few years working a rehab and nursing home, unfortunately saw way too much of this sort of thing from younger patients. They all said the same thing, \"I never thought it would happen to me!\" We had a saying there, \"At least you're alive to regret your decisions.\"", "I also have a motorcycle driver's license, so I also feel that I pay a little more attention to the road and what dangers there may be. Because I know things can go very wrong", "It was really intense, not only did they have to deliver/save a baby in a crushed car, but also rescue the mother and prevent death or paralysis. I can't remember what happened but the doc felt so guilty. But even in reality, if the passenger has their legs in this position they're guaranteed to fall to either paralysis/death, that is a fact.\nStick to your guns, you're not only guaranteeing their safety but yours as well, especially legally.", "I'm glad I made you chuckle. It's a good rule to have and I'm also not going to be responsible for people becoming a human pretzel", "Thanks.

That's why I suggested stopping more often along the way to walk and so on. But I still don't understand why she had to sit that way.", "Oh thank you, I was not aware of that. I thought it might have been easily changed.", "Thank you, it would have been great if I was able to negotiate in that situation but indeed we were all too emotional for that.", "I agree with you, unfortunatly they both blocked me so I can not send them anything. Will give them time to cool off, maybe then they won't block me anymore. If not well that that is what it is.", "Thats a great saying, although I can also imagine that some people get mad if you say that. I personally use something like \"at least now you know not to do that again\". \nBut it is certainly true, people often think that those kind of things can never happen to them, that it only happens to others or that they only see it on the news.", "You know they\u2019re called \u201cdonor cycles\u201d right? \n\nWeird you\u2019re that concerned with how she\u2019s sitting when you\u2019re willing to get on / drive a motor cycle.

Angry people will bust their asses to do the work of rehab and those in the middle of a pity party, not so much...", "Oh sorry I understand your confusion about this now, that was not the intention.
