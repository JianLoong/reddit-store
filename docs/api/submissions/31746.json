On phone. \n\nTwo friends, Grace and Alice, and I would go on a week-long road trip. We took my car and the plan was to mostly camp (first and last night in a hotel). Grace and I would alternate driving, so the other could rest or nap when necessary. Alice doesn't have a license so she navigated and would therefore stay in the front seat.\n\n\nThat's where the problem arose, Alice suddenly put her legs on the dashboard, I asked if she could please sit down normally. She didn't understand that because \"this won't bother you, will it?\" I tried to explain what happens when you have an accident sitting like that and that I didn't want to be responsible for that. Alice thought I was joking so started laughing. I stopped at a gas station to continue talking. After a while she angrily said that she would sit normally again but she still didn't understand the problem. Grace and Alice then went to the gas station to get something. I stayed at the car.\n\n\nAt the toilet a little later I overheard Grace say \"I think it's nonsense too, but you know how she can be, when she's sleeping you can just sit like that\". When they came back I said that I wanted Alice only in the back of the car. This turned into an argument again. I did not say that I heard their conversation, I didn't feel like that. \n\n\nBecause Alice kept refusing to sit in the back, I called the hotel to cancel. This made them both very angry and they took all their stuff and called an Uber. I drove myself back home. At home I noticed a lot of messages and missed calls from mutual friends and family saying some unkind things. Alice had made a post on social media about what a terrible friend I am. I saw that they went camping before they blocked me.\n\n\n\nI thought this would be for the best, I did not want her to be folded up like a pretzel in an accident and lose her legs. It's my car so my rules and my responsibility if something goes wrong. But many friends and family think I exaggerated and perhaps I shouldn't have reacted that way. Maybe I shouldn't have canceled the hotel and gone home.\nAm I the asshole for cancelling and going home?
