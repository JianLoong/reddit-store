It was hard on all of us to deal with, and she did treat us horribly. Dad (technically my stepdad, if it matters) tried really hard to help her, but she would just lie and steal. It got to the worst point when she stole from dad while he was in hospital, and mum disowned her. After he passed Kida finally realised that she had an issue and needed to leave drugs and the bastard that took advantage of her.\n\nWe had always been close, and when Kida came to me I helped her. It's been an extremely difficult 5 years, but she's now 3 years sober. Kida's made so much progress, and I'm really proud of her. She's even trying to pay us all back for everything she's stolen. I understand that she hurt our family a lot and that they don't have to forgive her. Even after all her efforts to get sober and pay her back, mum won't forgive Kida. She worked hard and paid most of the debt off. She's tried to apologise. \n\nI've tried to stay out of it, but this mother's day got too much. Kida came over to drop off a mother day gift. She didn't say anything other than happy mother's day. She didn't try to come in or beg forgiveness. She didn't even mean to be seen when she dropped it off. But mum was horrible and basically told her she doesn't have a daughter and doesn't want anything unless it's the money and just threw the gift away. I tried to stay out of it, but when I got home Kida was a wreck. \n\nShe's tried so hard and come so far. It's just not right for mum to be so cold. Like she doesn't have to forgive her but Christ, have some compassion for your daughter. I ended up trying to talk to mum about it but it went terribly. She basically told me to stop coddling her, and I got mad. \n\n\nWe fought pretty bad. I honestly think it's disgusting, especially when she's been sober so long now. She shouldn't be punished for eternity. Especially not in that disgusting way. I did tell her that dad would be ashamed and that the least she can do is accept a fucking mother's day gift. No one is saying to take a fucking holiday with her. Mum thinks I'm just babying her and that I'll end up regret it. My other siblings think I'm a major asshole, and that I'm being a horrible son. Apparently I should be on her side instead of 'that druggie bitch'. That even dad wouldn't forgive what she did.\n\n\nI think they're being unfair and unreasonable. They don't have to forgive but she doesn't need to treat her that way. It's just disgusting. She's still human, she's still family. It's been 5 years, she's nothing like she used to. I believe I'm right, but I don't mean to hurt mum and definitely don't intend to hurt dad's memory.", "created_utc": 1684593949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mw6qn/aita_telling_mum_dad_would_be_ashamed_how_shes/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you have been a great brother, helped your sister through a terrible time in her life and Kida is indeed making much progress. You should stay out of your mother and Kida's situation however. She might have had a different experience than you did with your sister, and might not be ready to forgive or not willing to forgive at all. Nobody owes Kida forgiveness, no matter how much she changes. It may happen one day, it may not. If your mother seems to be this against a reconciliation, than going no contact might be the healtier option for both of them, at least for the duration. \n\nI think you should apologise to your mother for what you said, and never bring up Kida again unless she asks specifically. Also encourage Kida to keep her distance from her, again, unless your mother is signaling otherwise.", "It\u2019s hard to forgive. I think your mom is still hurt.

Throwing your father in your moms face was so wrong. She lost her husband and her daughter betrayed her.\n\nIt\u2019s great that you have forgiven her. But you need to realize and so does your sister not everyone has to forgive her. They may never forgive her.\n\nShe has apologized and is trying to make a mends. Now she just needs to live them be. If they want to contact her they can but she can\u2019t force her way back into their lives. She needs to respect that.\n\nYou need to apologize to your mother. You got involved in something that was none of your business and took it way to far. It\u2019s great you stood up for your sister but you went way over board with what you said to your mother.

While I agree with you, there are people who have a very hard time letting go. Your mother is very angry at Kida, and refuses to forgive her. However, since she does not want Kida in her life, just respect her wishes. Instead, you just be there for Kida and support her through her recovery. Tell Kida to go LC or even NC if needed with your mother, and make sure she is surrounded by loving and supportive family members instead.", "YTA you don't get to decide when someone should forgive or be forgiven.

But know that mom may never forgive Kida. Not that she right, she\u2019s definitely wrong here. You and Kida need to move on from here. Time to back away, and let moms decisions be what she has. Kida means well, and so do you, but mom isn\u2019t changing anytime soon. Just let her be, she\u2019s cruel and not good for Kidas recovery. \nSo where do you go from here? This is the proverbial fork in the road. It\u2019s your choice, you can go NC with mom, and support Kida or leave life as status quo and put up with mom making Kida feel lesser than.

Your mother has made it clear that she doesn't want anything to do with your step sister. She just wants to be paid back what was stolen from her. She doesn't want anything to do with your step-sis, as is her right. She has set a pretty clear boundary. You and step-sis have selfishly trampled this boundary and keep trying to get step sis to be involved in your mothers life. Your step-sis is acting entitled, selfish, and wants to appease her own guilt and to clear her own conscience. Let be real, step-sis is only thinking about herself. If she was truly remorseful, she would respect your mother wishes and leave her alone. It's not okay for your step-sis to give gifts or stop by your mothers place or try and make it up to your mother. No wonder your mother reacted that way. I'd be bloody pissed if people were not respecting my boundaries. You are not even listening to what your mother wants. She is a person with her own feelings and has a right to cut whoever the hell she wants out of her life.
