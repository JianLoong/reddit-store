It was hard on all of us to deal with, and she did treat us horribly. Dad (technically my stepdad, if it matters) tried really hard to help her, but she would just lie and steal. It got to the worst point when she stole from dad while he was in hospital, and mum disowned her. After he passed Kida finally realised that she had an issue and needed to leave drugs and the bastard that took advantage of her.\n\nWe had always been close, and when Kida came to me I helped her. It's been an extremely difficult 5 years, but she's now 3 years sober. Kida's made so much progress, and I'm really proud of her. She's even trying to pay us all back for everything she's stolen. I understand that she hurt our family a lot and that they don't have to forgive her. Even after all her efforts to get sober and pay her back, mum won't forgive Kida. She worked hard and paid most of the debt off. She's tried to apologise. \n\nI've tried to stay out of it, but this mother's day got too much. Kida came over to drop off a mother day gift. She didn't say anything other than happy mother's day. She didn't try to come in or beg forgiveness. She didn't even mean to be seen when she dropped it off. But mum was horrible and basically told her she doesn't have a daughter and doesn't want anything unless it's the money and just threw the gift away. I tried to stay out of it, but when I got home Kida was a wreck. \n\nShe's tried so hard and come so far. It's just not right for mum to be so cold. Like she doesn't have to forgive her but Christ, have some compassion for your daughter. I ended up trying to talk to mum about it but it went terribly. She basically told me to stop coddling her, and I got mad. \n\n\nWe fought pretty bad. I honestly think it's disgusting, especially when she's been sober so long now. She shouldn't be punished for eternity. Especially not in that disgusting way. I did tell her that dad would be ashamed and that the least she can do is accept a fucking mother's day gift. No one is saying to take a fucking holiday with her. Mum thinks I'm just babying her and that I'll end up regret it. My other siblings think I'm a major asshole, and that I'm being a horrible son. Apparently I should be on her side instead of 'that druggie bitch'. That even dad wouldn't forgive what she did.\n\n\nI think they're being unfair and unreasonable. They don't have to forgive but she doesn't need to treat her that way. It's just disgusting. She's still human, she's still family. It's been 5 years, she's nothing like she used to. I believe I'm right, but I don't mean to hurt mum and definitely don't intend to hurt dad's memory.", "created_utc": 1684593949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mw6qn/aita_telling_mum_dad_would_be_ashamed_how_shes/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you have been a great brother, helped your sister through a terrible time in her life and Kida is indeed making much progress. You should stay out of your mother and Kida's situation however. She might have had a different experience than you did with your sister, and might not be ready to forgive or not willing to forgive at all. Nobody owes Kida forgiveness, no matter how much she changes. It may happen one day, it may not. If your mother seems to be this against a reconciliation, than going no contact might be the healtier option for both of them, at least for the duration. \n\nI think you should apologise to your mother for what you said, and never bring up Kida again unless she asks specifically. Also encourage Kida to keep her distance from her, again, unless your mother is signaling otherwise.", "It\u2019s hard to forgive. I think your mom is still hurt.

Throwing your father in your moms face was so wrong. She lost her husband and her daughter betrayed her.\n\nIt\u2019s great that you have forgiven her. But you need to realize and so does your sister not everyone has to forgive her. They may never forgive her.\n\nShe has apologized and is trying to make a mends. Now she just needs to live them be. If they want to contact her they can but she can\u2019t force her way back into their lives. She needs to respect that.\n\nYou need to apologize to your mother. You got involved in something that was none of your business and took it way to far. It\u2019s great you stood up for your sister but you went way over board with what you said to your mother.

Tell Kida to go LC or even NC if needed with your mother, and make sure she is surrounded by loving and supportive family members instead.", "YTA you don't get to decide when someone should forgive or be forgiven.

But know that mom may never forgive Kida. Not that she right, she\u2019s definitely wrong here. You and Kida need to move on from here. Time to back away, and let moms decisions be what she has.

Your mother has made it clear that she doesn't want anything to do with your step sister. She just wants to be paid back what was stolen from her. She doesn't want anything to do with your step-sis, as is her right. She has set a pretty clear boundary. You and step-sis have selfishly trampled this boundary and keep trying to get step sis to be involved in your mothers life. Your step-sis is acting entitled, selfish, and wants to appease her own guilt and to clear her own conscience. Let be real, step-sis is only thinking about herself. If she was truly remorseful, she would respect your mother wishes and leave her alone. It's not okay for your step-sis to give gifts or stop by your mothers place or try and make it up to your mother. No wonder your mother reacted that way. I'd be bloody pissed if people were not respecting my boundaries. You are not even listening to what your mother wants. She is a person with her own feelings and has a right to cut whoever the hell she wants out of her life.

A slight thaw would've been wonderful!\nBut not OPs choice...\n\nYet I also agree.. definitely NTA for trying.  Always good to have someone in your city. Just needs to stay there for now...lol", "Kids stole from OP\u2019s mom when OP\u2019s mom\u2019s spouse was DYING. Mom here was being really kind because I am surprised she didn\u2019t call the police. Kids and OP need to let their mother alone about this. Kids is owed nothing.", "Sorry isn\u2019t a get out of jail free card. She screwed up.", "That was YOUR choice to help your step sister and \"raise her.\" Your mum gets to bitch about someone who put her through hell.\nWhat's cruel is what you and step-sis are doing to your mother. It's seems cruelty is necessary because you guys don't respect your mothers boundaries. Back off.", "you were able to forgive her and that\u2019s okay but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to, which includes interacting with her. my entire family has been on drugs and struggled with addiction and i\u2019m very sympathetic to recovering addicts but it\u2019s takes time, my mom has been clean for 7 years and i still have barely managed to move on and forgive her for everything", "Disowning someone who stole from your dying husband doesn\u2019t mean you are the one who didn\u2019t understand what family was.", "Friend, your sister is *still* boundary stomping all over your step mom. \n\nYour sister was a terror while your father was alive. Disrespect, thievery, drama, chaos, fear, and on and on were all that she brought to their relationship while your stepmom was caring for your ailing father (so step mom ALSO had to deal with all the extra demands and work that come with being a caregiver, along with fear and stress and worry and devastation that comes with watching the person you love deteriorate and suffer and eventually die).\n\nAll of this *during COVID lockdowns* (if the timeline is correct) so add isolation and extra fear, maybe not being allowed to be with her husband if he was in and out of the hospital?\n\nAnd while step mom was literally going through the hardest and most painful portion of her life, your sister was awful, stole what I'm guessing adds up to thousands based on the fact that payments are being made (did step mom need that money for medical bills? Her own retirement? covering the funeral?) and didn't give a shit about how her addicted deranged behavior affected anyone else. \n\nAnd it's only been three years since your father passed? That's not enough time to recover from the death, and from your sister's abuse.\n\nAnd your sister is *still* not respecting your step mom, dropping off gifts when your step mom wants no contact right now. \n\nRight now your sister needs to back off, and you need to have some compassion for the daily Hell your step mother went through, and the flaming shit and pain your sister kept ADDING to the situation.\n\nHonestly, it's great that your sister is sober (seriously! I know I'm being harsh, but sobriety is not easy and she's getting it together!) but that doesn't erase the horror she added to your step mom's already tragic situation. \n\nStep mom is likely feeling emptied and burned out and possibly incapable of forgiveness until she gets real space and compassion to heal.", "If she wanted to honor the woman who raised her, she wouldn\u2019t have stolen from that woman\u2019s dying spouse and she would respect the word no. Your mom doesn\u2019t forgive her. Respect her wishes and have Kida leave her alone. She\u2019s been told no. Dang, what more can she say? Kida, leave her alone! You\u2019re not wanted theee!", "Going by all of your arguments, I expect you to forgive your mother and let it go. Just like you're expecting her to do.", "It could be, and of course it's a response that would make sense given the circumstance. But, it wasn't even like the daughter was forcing herself on the mother again. She seems to know that her actions caused a lot of harm and was trying to avoid direct contact and just leave a small token. It kinda sounds like the mother took what could have just been an unfortunate crossing of paths and blew it up to yet another traumatic event.\n\nAnd yes, the daughter is reaping what she's sown, but that can also go the same way for the mother. If she keeps sowing anger, hatred, and lack of compassion, she might get that in return later. Who knows, that could even cause the daughter to return to using. Idk though, I have only been in a slightly semi-similar situation.", "Kida was a child when her bio-mom's creepy boyfriend started giving her drugs, which led to her addiction. What kind of parents were OP's mom and stepdad to \"not be aware\" that this was happening and to let her be in that type of dangerous environment?\n\nAt the very least, I think Kida is owed an apology from the adults in her life that didn't intervene and do more to protect her from some scuzzy grown man who ruined her life.", "What part of making amends do you not understand?", "What's important is that she's trying to be the bigger and better person than she used to be. By how the rest of the family is acting, Kida and OP are, in fact, the bigger and better people.", "She was 14/15. It started small and she didn't exactly say where she got the drugs. From what I know, Mum and dad didn't know he was involved until she was like 18/19. They tried to act on that, but didnt have proof or anything to actually do something. Especially since her biological mother supports the bastard.", "***hiss***", "It wasn't a choice. Pretending it is is just ignoring reality.\n\nKick her to the streets? Back to that predator? That's not a solution to anything.\n\nI'm doing what dad wanted. What I fucking promised him. This wasn't some choice. \n\nDo you think I fucking wanted this? I wish I was allowed to grieve, to have a normal life without having to give it up for Kida because mum forgot what being stepmum means.", "theres a big part about making amends you dont seem to understand. You arent owed forgiveness. You have to accept if you're not forgiven,  And you arent supposed to make amends if doing so will cause more harm to the already injured party. Sounds like you're the one who doesnt understand step 9.", "Her mother doesn't need to accept her making amends. Kida unfortunately isn't entitled to forgiveness.", "you act like someone forced you to do this, you chose to and they chose not to", "You're doing a great thing helping Kids recover, but you did chose to do it. It wasn't your duty. It's a responsibility you took on.", "You 100% had a choice.  You can not choose to own things that are not yours to own and then be mad about it.  Well you can, but it makes YTA", "When you marry someone that has other kids, you're not making a decision to be the kids parent. A lot of times, if the kids are younger, the most you get is a (hopefully) positive adult role model and/or confident.\n\nSometimes you become a parental figure if the dynamics workout that way, but it's not required. You need to understand this. Your mom does not have a mother daughter relationship with Kida, even though you have a brother sister relationship with her. And that's OK.", "So if there\u2019s no proof he gave her the drugs and she\u2019s already been a confirmed stealing junkie. How are you so sure she wasn\u2019t lying about the boyfriend to deflect blame from her?", "That\u2019s a really sad story. I\u2019m surprised your parents had no idea the boyfriend was involved and I\u2019m also surprised that they let Kida go with her mother at all if she kept company with such seedy people.", "Ok fucking weirdo", "Honestly, why did you post here? You're arguing with damn near everyone, and that isn't the point of this sub (not to mention it's against the rules).", "Your parents obviously didn\u2019t sit back and do nothing. Again how many chances did Kida get? How many times did your mom and dad offer to help only for her to throw it back in their faces? I bet it was a lot.\n\nHer stealing from your dad was your moms finale straw.\n\nActually Kida\u2019s biomom forgot what being a mother means. At the end of the day, your mom is really only truly responsible for her own children. \n\nIt\u2019s not your moms fault you can\u2019t grow up and stop enabling someone. Kida is 25. There\u2019s plenty of support groups for addicts and all of them would be appalled by your behavior. They say that while you should make amends you should also respect those who still won\u2019t want a thing to do with you.", "Funny how with every comment it becomes so much more obvious this is just about you lol", "There it is. You resent your mother because you think she dumped Kida and you felt forced to swoop in and save the day when you didn\u2019t feel ready. This is where your problems lie. \n\nYou did a wonderful thing, but you can\u2019t use that as a weapon to punish other people for their decisions. Your mother has her reasons and you need to respect them.  You also need to stay out of the relationship between your mother & Kida. It\u2019s not healthy for you to be involved like this.", "She doesn't believe she's owed anything, she's trying to gain forgiveness by paying back what is owed and trying to show appreciation for the woman in her life that she views is her real mother.", "Even mum acknowledges that the bastard was involved. She wouldn't cover for Kida.", "They probably thought it was something school or friend related and didn't want to pry in hopes that she'd open up to them herself.", "But the straight up cruelty to a human being just trying to make things right is excusable? I think not and clearly a lot of decent human beings think the same.", "I'm saying my side because they said it was a choice. They explicitly made it about me.", "You did have a choice hun, and you made it. Good for you. But you don't get to dictate the choices your family made, and you don't get to be resentful that they didn't make the same choice as you.", "Ah, here\u2019s the resentment starting to come through lmao\n\nSad you\u2019re taking it out on your mom rather than the person who actually caused all of this.", "A bad horrible choice is still a choice. No one is judging you for helping your sister out. You did a good thing for her and your need to keep doing that. What people are judging on you is the fact that you seem unable to accept that others in your family can't forgive your sister. Kida needs to focus on herself rather than making efforts to reconcile with your mum, who is clearly not interested in reconciliation. And you need to take a step back and let things go at their own pace. It might be that in time your mum might be willing to take the next step in the future. It might be that she will never be ready. That's her choice and you need to accept that like it was your choice to help your sister.", "Well kudos to you. Doesn't mean anybody else has to and you're missing the point. The point is they have decided she is not their family and you can't change that. that's not cruelty that's self protection. The part that makes you the ah is that you want to inflict your viewpoint on the other members of your family and that's just wrong. And if you want to talk about cruelty twisting the knife in your mother about what your father may or may not have wanted is cruel. Let the woman grieve. You cannot force your mother to forgive and forget. She either will or she won't and she'll do it on her own damn timeline.", "Those are your choices.  Your mom is allowed to make her own choices. You simply cannot get yourself so concerned about the behavior of other people; you cannot control or change it, ever\u2026only they can.", "Yes, it is. If my siblings stole from my dying mother I wouldn\u2019t accept shit from them either.", "You don't know many addicts do you?", "And you became much more animated once that was brought up which is very telling lol", "Why don't you try seeing your family fall apart and tell your dying father you'll abandon her. That you'll ignore everything he taught you about family, that you don't care about his dying request.", "Kida's a victim. She never wanted this, and was taken advantage of as a teenager. \n\nMum doesn't have to forgive her. But at bare minimum can just acknowledge she has is daughter.\n\nJUST THAT would mean the world to Kida. Not even a relationship, just having a mother.", "It's a 'choice' like paying taxes is a 'choice'. Since mum wouldn't step up I had to.\n\nI mean what is a realistic alternative? Abandon her? Tell my dying dad that actually I don't give a fuck about his daughter?", "Kida is paying everything that she owes, and then some. Cruelty is undeserving of those trying to make up for past wrongs.", "Yes, I do. Most of them have turned their lives around and have been making amends just like Kida."]}
