As someone who's had chronic depression and anxiety for most of my life, here's how my mom helped me and how I do it now:\n\n1. Take all the shame out of the conversation. Do not refer to her room as a \"pigsty,\" do not yell at her for not cleaning, just don't. Shame doesn't help. It does more harm than good, and if you want your kid to build coping skills to maintain her living space then you need to be kind about it.\n2. You mentioned she refuses your help because she doesn't want you going through her stuff. Have you thought about body doubling for her? It's a coping mechanism mainly used for people with ADHD where someone is in the room with them when they're trying to get a task done. I do it all the time for cleaning and it helps me stay focused. You wouldn't necessarily need to be involved in the tidying, but having someone with her to support her might be helpful.\n3. Have you taught her how to clean her room? I'm not talking about how to use cleaning products, but the order in which she should go about it. When I was her age my mother would clean my depression rooms with me and show me a specific order to do each task in. Clothes off the ground first, then picking up any trash, then taking any dishes out to the kitchen, then vacuuming and mopping, etc. I still do that order to this day. Having a set routine can take a lot of the overwhelming thoughts away.\n\nAll in all, you need to be kinder to your kid.

Seeing as her week is clearly packed already, she needs that personal time. Partially just because she's a teenager, but also because she's depressed. It's not going to help her to give up the things she enjoys. Plus, there's the pressure of knowing she lets her boyfriend down if she has to cancel at the last minute, and it's embarrassing for her to have to tell him and his family the reason she can't come is because she has to clean her closet. \n\nAlso, as others have mentioned, her closet being a wreck is likely related to her depression. Don't punish her for that. Help her with it. Talk with her (without any judgement!) about what's stopping her from being able to clean it and what needs to happen to get it taken care of. If you support her and show her respect and understanding rather than judgement you might find that things work out a lot better for both of you. She's struggling. If you'd sat down to talk with her rather than jumping to an ultimatum, maybe you two could've come to the compromise that it would be the first thing she does when she gets back from her trip since this was a busy week for her. Or maybe she would've told you that she can't handle all her responsibilities right now because it's just too much, or because she doesn't have the motivation because of her depression. \n\nI totally understand that you want her to clean up after herself and you're concerned and probably upset by the fact that she's let her closet stay a mess for so long. But understand that mental health issues complicate things, and you getting upset with her is not going to help her. It might make sure those things you want done get done, but you need to support your daughter. While you can, let her focus as much as possible on her mental health and her school and her future.

You know your daughter has a diagnosis that makes organization and cleaning difficult. I'm going out on a limb here and assume that the reason your daughter's **closet** is a mess is that you demand her room be to a specific standard, and because she doesn't have the energy to actually keep it like that, she shoves whatever she has to into her closet so her room can pass inspection.\n\n(BTW, that is a excellent coping strategy if she's doing it on her own. Having a room that's a mess can negatively impact depression and anxiety, so if she's keeping her room in order by shoving stuff in her closet and closing the door without someone demanding the room be a specific way, then that's actually a good thing.)\n\nI don't understand why people don't get this fact: living with a diability/medical condition that inhibits certain life functions means the individual has a **limitation** and this mentalilty of \"this needs to be a priority\" when it should NOT be a priority can be so effing damaging.\n\nIf the closet is super smelly and was filled with rotting food/trash/mold, then that's a priority to clean because that's dangerously unhygenic.\n\nBut if the closet is super messy with piles of random stuff on the floor, then that's not a priority to clean. It's not hurting anyone, and it very likely is helping your daughter.\n\nAlso, the fact that you allowed her to cancel her therapy appointment - which you knew she was doing to fulfill you demand she clean her closet on your timetable - pretty much means that you canceled her appointment. I mean, you didn't let her stay home from school, did you? No, that's absolutely necessary, you wouldn't let her skip school to do it. Why isn't therapy in that same bucket?", "YTA. Thats a literal symptom of depression. Instead of yelling, have some compassion.

A messy room won't hurt you. Eventually the messy room will get to the point where she has no clean clothes etc. and she'll learn the consequences on her own. Was there food rotting in there? Make sure she takes that out, but if she really has NO free time... maybe that's the reason she doesn't have time to clean?", "You think tidying her closet is more pressing than tidying her own thoughts?\n\nYes YTA.\n\nWere you paid to admit this?", "Completely agree with the therapist. Who cares if a closet is a mess? YTA. \nAny bets on LC in the future?", "YTA. Your daughter is in therapy for anxiety and depression and you are just making it worse!! Why not try to help her instead?? Going out and going to the therapist are healthy things to do. A clean closet helps too - but her illness may make that really hard. Why not just help her with the closet and help her get better!!", "YTA \nIf the closet is hers in her room you don't need to be going in there and putting pressure on her to clean it is going to cause more anxiety and depression. This sounds more about you trying to control your daughter then care for your daughter and her mental health, especially when the mess isn't in shared space. Let the natural consequences occur, if her closet doesn't get cleaned it's her problem which she will get to on her own time and will be her own problem. Stop making it a you problem. This isn't preparing her for life out of high-school, you're not teaching her anything, you're adding unnecessary stress. Is this really a hill you want to die on? Is it really that big of a deal? Sure it's not how you want to live in your room, but once again it's not your room or your space. In the adult world there is no harsh punishments for not cleaning your closet the punishment is having to deal with it down the road and realizing how excessive it can get and if she wants to live like that. My mom was super strict about clean spaces and that constant nag made me resent her and resent cleaning to the point where when I did finally have my own space/home I never wanted to clean it because I finally had the freedom not to. It wasn't until 5-6 years of living on my own where I found cleaning to be an act of self love and not holding resentment to it and being able to keep a clean space.", "Your daughter will leave one day.

Congratulations for putting a bandage on the problem.", "YTA. Who gives a crap about a messy closet.  Learn to pick your battles.", "YTA. Why do you need to control the inside of her closet?", "YTA. You acknowledge that she's seeing a therapist for depression and anxiety, but it seems to me that you haven't done *any* research on either condition. Be better.", "YTA", "YTA It's extremely hard to find motivation to clean when depressed, and anxiety can make even small tasks feel overwhelming. I've struggled with clinical depression through my teenage years and entire adult life. At one point, I had literal bags of trash in my room because the task of taking the bags to the dumpster was insurmountable. Not being able to do such a simple thing and living in a trash bin made the depression worse, creating a downward spiral. Finding the right medication has helped tremendously, but I still have bad days when things like showering or vacuuming seem overwhelming.\n\nThis strategy of punishing her has worked once, but it didn't solve the root problem. Maybe at her next therapy appointment, they can discuss strategies to help her stay more organized. Little things like doing one chore a day, or forgoing certain steps when she doesn't have enough spoons. For example, I usually fold my laundry, but when I'm out of energy, I will just put the clothes into their assigned drawers without folding. It's messy, but it means there isn't a pile of clean laundry sitting on my bed, being a nuisance.\n\nThese techniques can help your daughter in the long term, as she can practice and adapt them once she leaves home, and can even develop new strategies as new challenges come up. I understand it can be frustrating that your daughter didn't do what you asked. It's also important to remember that she's not bring obstinate on purpose--this is a literal result of her mental health condition. Depression saps energy and can even be physically painful, making it difficult to be productive. It'll be beneficial for everyone to prioritize your daughter's health, as the condition of her room will likely improve as a result.", "YTA and I\u2019ll tell you where you messed up.

If it gets too bad to the point you can't even walk through there anymore I'll help him clean and organize either the whole room or at least enough that he can get in there and how much we clean is always up to him. Sometimes he wants it all done and sometimes he just wants a walkway. I honestly hate it but that's his room his space. I knock on his door and I ask to borrow or use things.

I wouldn't be surprised if the same could be said here.", "Same and now I'm medicated it's mostly better but my imposter syndrome where I don't think I'm as good as I am and have no business doing things I do is very strong and I can't kick it. I'm in uni now and doing amazing but I still don't know how or... idk like I'm not good enough despite my grades being distinctions and high distinctions across the board consistently. I spent weeks saying I felt like I was cheating in one subject last year because of how easy I found it. I wasn't cheating I'm just good at design it turns out.\n\nGetting a job will be a challenge if I don't believe in myself I guess. The excellent lasting issues of being told you never applied yourself or fulfilled your potential and you could do better for decades.", "Steal away! And I love the concept of bullet journaling but sitting down and actually doing it just sends me into total chaos mindset. So I just don't", "I work in a health centre. Despite the legal voting age being 18 in my country, at the age of 16 our patients have complete agency in making and modifying their appointments. This also applies to mental health appointments.", "This! As a mental health professional I can say that OP, you royally messed up here. First off, her going out and doing things is good! She needs to get out of her head. Second, your actions meant she lost out on a therapy session which she needs. \n\nI get you don't want to \"live as slobs\" but honestly, the closet is a closet and that's YOUR priority. You've decided it needs to be done and you've decided when it needs to be done. \n\nDid you talk to her about it? And i mean talk,  not order, not tell, not dictate, but actually talk to her about it? Find out what the struggle is, or hell even find a way to compromise with her? My guess is no, you probably just told her what to do and then lashed out when she didn't meet your expectations.\n\nParents who dictate do more harm than good. Just food for thought", "I have been struggling with depression/anxiety since honestly I could ever remember, and showering was so so so hard somehow, and such a shameful thing, it felt, to neglect as well. I\u2019m on day 94 of showering every day and honestly it\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m most proud of. And it\u2019s the same thing with living in a clean environment. When you don\u2019t think you\u2019re even worth cleaning/cleaning for, why would you?", "Also, my wife and many of our friends are therapists, and I cannot imagine a single one of them telling a client's parent \"that's a dumb hill to die on\"", "This was very refreshing to read. It seems like OP wants control more than she wants to see her daughter mentally well", "i have a 17 year old sister, never get between them and their friends/partner. it turns nightmarish. apparently OP offered to help clean but was told no, and cleaning the closet/room a little bit a day before sleeping or dinner isn\u2019t that big of a deal. i understand therapy and anxiety i have had it but choosing to cancel your therapy session is totally the daughters fault", "The consequence is I\u2019ll come do it with you? What exactly is the consequence for the child in that, please?\n\nShe gave her a real consequence. Get it done or no trip. Just didn\u2019t figure on the whole\u2026. Just cancel therapy\u2026 piece in there.", "One thing that helps me is finding a way to make it interesting or fun, which usually involves buying new cleaning supplies. But I get excited to use my new gloves or new scrubber or whatever, so I get the dopamine.", "Daughter probably told them that mom said cleaning the closet was more important or something like that", "Hate to break it to you, but at 17 my sister was PREGNANT and the school was helping her get to OBGYN appointments behind my mother's back. For 4 MONTHS, nobody at the school, or the doctors office told my mom, so I wouldn't find it hard to believe at all that the doctor didn't tell the parent that the 17 year old had cancelled the appointment. \n\nPersonally, I have a 13 year old who I've been battling with for MONTHS to clean her room. I refuse to do it, because I've always given in and the up perfectly cleaning and organizing her room, which she then trashes. I cleaned it last in August, and whoooweee, disgusting. I refuse to do it again, she can clean up her own GD room. \n\nOP is not the AH with the info I have.", "To be fair when i was 17 i was making my own and canceling and rescheduling appointments on my own this kid weeks to clean up and she waited until the last minute not the parents fault yeah some she has depression or whatever but at her age im not even gonna lie sometimes i was just lazy and didnt want to do it", "Yea she can go on a weekend trip with a boyfriend (adult behavior) but can't clean a closet?"]}
