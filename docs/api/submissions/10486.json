I can tell you from personal experience that I didn\u2019t understand the connection between therapy and it\u2019s ability to help you with things like depression. Her mom is acting like she just cancelled a hair appointment so her daughter probably puts that same amount of importance to it. Being that her mom is a full grown adult, she should be able to put together that this \u2018messy closet\u2019 is an indicator of her daughters mental health state \u2014 a connection that you don\u2019t have enough life experience at 17 to put together", "OP essentially forced her into it because she wants a stupid clean closet. You are silly.", "After telling her for 3 weeks. She could have stayed up a little late to do it. Woken up a little early. You really think no other time where it could been done by the weekend that wasnt during therapy session?", "Mother told her weeks in advance and the daughter did not care. You're phrasing it like this was some last minute thing, and that is not what is written in the post. It doesn't take weeks to clean a closet, and you don't need to cancel a, presumably, one hour appointment to fit that into your schedule. You're acting like cleaning your closet is some huge task.

Daughter chose to cancel her therapy session!! Since when did grounding your kids when not cleaning your room become not Ok?! Daughter had a lot of chances to clean her closet, and she kept pushing it. Yes she had other things, but a little here and there would make a difference. This has been an issue for weeks!

Daughter has refused the help.", "100% this. I suffer from ptsd, depression and anxiety. Tthese tasks can be so debilitating and I am so thankful I had a mother who 1.

Whether she had to miss the weekend trip or whether she was able to get it done another time, trading therapy time shouldn't have been allowed to be on the table. Most therapy sessions are an hour, maybe another hour commuting time - hard to imagine the cleaning had to be in exactly these two hours and nothing else would work.\n\nPersonally, I would consider that a messy closet isn't hurting anyone, and see it as a completely normal and expected symptom of anxiety and depression. If my loved one still had enough energy/motivation to get out of the house and spend the day socializing, getting some sunshine or movement, with the bf's family, I'd be thrilled they were still doing well enough for that. Should they be encouraged to work toward cleaning it, with lots of grace and support? Absolutely. Should it be prioritized over getting out of the house and interacting with loved ones? I'd say no.

Definitely not. \n\nPunishing someone dealing with depression and anxiety for a messy closet, something that could clearly be a symptom of their disease that they are trying to get help for, seems like punishing an asthmatic for wheezing by making them do laps.", "I can\u2019t see the floor in either of my teenagers\u2019 rooms\u2026and I just close the door.

Instead of planning any other time to accomplish it the daughter deliberately chose to wait until the last minute pretty much playing a game of chicken with her mother. When she realized the line in the sand wasn't budging she chose to cancel her therapy appt to give herself the extra hour or two. This was not on the mom. Could it have been handled better, possibly, but she isn't a horrid mother for this one thing. Sometimes depression anxiety etc have ZERO to do with parents actions and have to do with chemical imbalances in the brain along with pressures from peers etc.", "This is exactly what OP did.

Daughter chose to cancel her therapy appointment to clean the closet.", "that\u2019s not treating it casually though, that\u2019s letting an almost adult decide how to manage her own time and arrangements.

Other than that, I made them keep their doors closed so I didn't have to look at the mess. I was good with no bugs, lol. \n\nI worked very hard with them up until about 12-13 years old on cleaning and organizing their rooms. I had a rule that by a certain time on Sundays, they had to have clean rooms in order to get their allowances. They decided whether to keep up with the mess or clean it all at once. I didn't fight about it. Once they were teens I gave them autonomy.\n\nThey are adults now and have very clean houses. They don't even allow outdoor shoes to be worn inside.", "Canceling therapy shouldn't be an option. How does a 17 year old cancel an appointment without the parent knowing? I'm sure OP knew.

This is not a life-or-death issue. Therapist is 100% correct, it\u2019s a dumb hill to die on.", "Yeah which is a really shitty outcome for everyone. OP isn\u2019t happy, daughter isn\u2019t happy, daughter missed a therapy session she probably really needed and now resents OP. Therapist thinks OP is dumb.\n\nBut hey, at least the room is clean, right?", ">this is the choice she made.\n\nBingo. SHE made the choice. Mom didnt force anything.\n\nBeing depressed isnt the issue. THe issue is she was asked to do something simple for weeks and blew her OP off. Should op just shrug and say well no consequences.\n\nYou do know a mess can invite bugs and rodents and mold that can spread throughout a house right?", "That was always my rule as well, but I\u2019ve had a rough couple years with my kids (major mental health struggles) and I just don\u2019t have it in me to fight.", "I 100% agree to cancel therapy should not have been an option - but numerous others have made valid points in defense of the OP and you seem to be (I state this with respect) finding new reasons to not hold the daughter at least partially responsible. The OP gave weeks and to YOUR own point - the parent offered options and consequences (take my help, do it yourself, or by X date you will loose the privilege of going away with your boyfriend).\n\nI am also going to give the perspective from someone who was a teenager not too long ago (OK 12 years haha) -- when I was 17 it was incredibly easy for me to cancel appointments without my parents knowing. Even 11 years ago I could cancel almost anything via a text message - including therapy. Unless OP has stated otherwise (and apologies if I missed it) I don't think they gave consent. \n\nI also feel like some posts here are minimizing the agency of OP's daughter here. She is of course the child and needs support - but managing their own time schedule by this age is healthy and important in their development. \n\nMental health challenges are very real, very serious, and very important to address -- but they are not an excuse to infantilize someone.", "It's pretty easy to cancel therapy without informing the parent. Especially at 17 when she might go on her own.\n\nSource: I used to do this a lot. Parents would find out but not until much later.\n\nPlus, honestly, people are making way too huge a deal of canceling one therapy appointment. Like honestly she probably got more therapy from tackling that mess, and both having a clean room and creating the route for her to go on a trip, then she would've gotten from the single session.", "and as an almost adult she should know that she\u2019s still living in her parents home and has to be respectful as such. just because she\u2019s an almost adult doesn\u2019t mean she can decide to trash her room in her parents house.", "OP didn\u2019t make her daughter cancel the appointment. is that flying over peoples heads? \n\nif a clean closet isn\u2019t life or death why didn\u2019t daughter just do it within the weeks before OP told her \u201cno friends or boyfriend unless it\u2019s done\u201d? \n\ni bet Daughter wouldn\u2019t have liked her parent going in their and cleaning the closest herself either.", "I never fought or engaged in power struggles with my kids.

We have the parent perspective of not being able to handle a messy closet that isn't theirs. We don't know what else is going on because we don't see the other perspective. \n\nMost people would not make a closet the HTDO in a house. How does this closet come to such importance? A kid is struggling so much that they canceled therapy. The kid decided that losing therapy was worth being able to do the actual fun thing. That's a loophole. OP is upset the kid found a loophole. OP is upset about a messy closet. \n\nThere's a lot more here than OP isn't saying in order to look good. Any parent of a teen would love a messy closet to be their only worry. This sounds like such tight control.", "closet. It's a closet. It's so beyond unimportant that OP was able to happily ignore it for two weeks.", "Because it is not important to the 17 year old and/ or because she is literally suffering from depression and anxiety which can make motivating yourself to do something you\u2019re not interested in doing many times harder. \n\nI suffer from depression and when I\u2019m under its cloud brushing my teeth and showering can seem like huge tasks.
