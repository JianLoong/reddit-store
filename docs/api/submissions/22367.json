You and your siblings need to talk to your stepfather and remind him that all of you are not his maids or servants. Does your stepfather also bully your mother like this too? Is this something that you have had to deal with throughout your childhood? Please also ask your mother or other family members to address this matter with your stepfather, and remind him that he does not have the right to treat you or your siblings badly.", "What a dick. NTA", "Just off the first paragraph. NTA\n\nLet's see you were rudely woken up, barked a list of chores to do, threatened punishment if you didn't, was not helped like you were promised, made you finish their shopping, critiqued you when you didn't know where to put things, they never helped with cleaning, and expected to have energy to hang out in a full house environment. \n\nYour step dad is an asshole and I'll keep it polite and just say your mother is failing you here.", "NTA.
