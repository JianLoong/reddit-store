You didn't tell her what to do. You said, \"I'm not comfortable with [thing],\" and she decided that was reasonable and agreed not to do [thing], and then she dropped the ex altogether of her own accord. \n\nSome people are okay with their partners being friends with exes. Some aren't. You only said you felt uncomfortable with her hanging out with him one on one, which I can understand even if I don't agree. Clearly talking to him wasn't much of a priority for her if she was willing to drop him for a 6 month long relationship.\n\nThe real issue here is that your girlfriend isn't shutting down the blame game everyone is playing with you", "NTA. I think she was looking for an excuse to end the friendship and this was it.", "My first thought was AH because it\u2019s not a sustainable solution. \nFirst of all, I don\u2019t agree with you restricting your gf of 6 months to not feeling comfortable to communicate with her friend. Relationships are built on trust. Friends often hook up and find out they are not compatible in that sense. Does it mean they cannot remain friends after it happens? It\u2019s not a real friendship if they are only allowed to meet each other around other friends. You clearly made your gf uncomfortable and paranoid about talking to him so she cut him off completely in order to keep the peace with you. Instead you could talk through the reasons behind their hook up(s) and understand if your fear for it reoccurring is even rational enough. Restrictions like that make it look like you are insecure and don\u2019t trust your partner. It\u2019s not a healthy start. Are you planning to monitor your gf\u2019s movements and communications forever? Because if she felt like hooking up with someone other than you, it could be anyone not just that friend. And her frustration makes it more likely. \nSecondly, if that friend of hers is sincerely interested only being friends then perhaps you can test it by hanging out together. Might seem a bit uncomfortable at first but it\u2019s better you work on that issue in order to keep your relationship and not alienate your gf\u2019s friends. \u201cAccidental hookups\u201d are more prone to happen if you divide your social circles and her friends become less supportive of your relationship. If you manage to befriend her \u201cex hookup\u201d then it\u2019s highly unlikely he will try to get on w her behind your back.", "Soft YTA for a few reasons;\n\n1) You set boundaries for yourself and rules for others. Subtle difference but important - you can enforce your own boundaries but you can\u2019t necessarily enforce people following your rules.\n\n2) You don\u2019t have to like her hanging out 1:1 with her ex-hookup and it was fine to ask that she doesn\u2019t but you don\u2019t get to be salty that there was unintended consequences to your request. \n\n3) She\u2019s with you now and you either trust her or you don\u2019t - why do you have a problem with that hookup in particular? What do you think she might do with him that she isn\u2019t going to do with with someone else?", "If your answer is \u201cI trust her, but\u2026\u201d then you don\u2019t trust her. YTA", "She needs to talk to her friends and defend her bf.", "I mean, I hang out with one of my exes, sometimes one on one, but I understand that's not always something people would be comfortable with. I just don't get into relationships with people who aren't comfortable with it. It's a reasonable boundary, but it's also reasonable to want to maintain good friendships with people despite having slept with them before", "I dunno, I guess it's \"if you don't trust your partner, leave them\" it's like if a guy has to ask if a kid is his, the relationship should be over. Trust is a foundational part of a relationship and if it isn't there, the relationship is either toxic or doomed.", "I mean, they both establish a boundary between each other. Nothing wrong there, they communicated their feelings about the situation. And by his reaction being all pissed off and going around, blaming him while she herself dropped him off Seems like a good reason why. Every relationship is different if you\u2019re OK with your partner still hanging out with his or her ex one on one that\u2019s cool, but this relationship is different this relationship is, don\u2019t hang out with your ex one on one doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s controlling if she dropped him herself.", "Lmao not really. That's a pretty common and reasonable rule. Are you a bad driver if you think you should wear a seat belt, because a good driver won't need one?", "There is trust and then there's common sense. No one in their right minds wants their SO to be hanging alone with their ex hookups. Let's not be hypocrites here.", "I have a hard rule that my partner partner must follow: THEY CAN NOT CHEAT. So I guess I'm an asshole by your logic. I hate the bullshit of you can't have ultimatums on a relationship, because of course you can. It is flawed and childish.", "They have the same boundary?", "I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s ok in a relationship but If that\u2019s something that your significant other is ok with then there\u2019s no problem. People are different and they\u2019re allowed to have boundaries and standards for their own relationships. I\u2019m just not with this bullshit of calling things you don\u2019t like \u201cinsecurity\u201d", "I am glad for the comment. I know some people may not be comfortable with an ex being around and some of the opposite opinion. I just get annoyed when people get called insecure for being uncomfortable. Insecurity in itself isn't the issue because everyone has things they are insecure about. It is mostly the condescension that comes along with calling someone insecure that I can't stand. If you find out your partner is insecure about something, how does acting condescending help address the situation?", "Well, he said it was an ex hookup not an ex. Its quite different, they were not in love. She trusted her bf (OP) enough to tell him about it but he didn\u2019t trust her enough to let her choose what to do because by telling her not to hang out alone with that guy makes it sound like he doesn\u2019t trust her. Friends are understandable upset because she might request to only hang out when that guy is absent and they are probably concerned about the OP controlling her. I know they are just 20 so lot to learn.", "This is an expectation in almost every relationship, yeah. Cheating is cheating but that\u2019s not what im talking about. Many people have healthy friendships with people they used to be romantic or sexual with without meaning they are that way now. I would never imagine asking my partner to not see his ex fianc\u00e9 alone when she comes to town to visit- they shared a life together at one point, realized they\u2019re better as friends, who would I be to deny that or dictate what he can do?  I don\u2019t feel the need to chaperone their lunch date to catch up because I\u2019m an adult who can find ways to cope with whatever feelings come up.", "THere is nothing \"NORMAL\" about it. but you are right,t ehre are many jealous and insecure AHs.", "Who\u2019s they in your question?", "In reddits minds \n\n- men not allowed feelings or boundires when women are involved, but there are also assholes if they dont have feelings or boundaries", "My ex and I were friends before we dated, and we dated almost 10 years ago. Im sure it helps that my boyfriend has met him and is now also friends with him. We broke up because we just weren't compatible as a couple, it's not like he's a bad person. \n\nI may not feel the same way you do about it, but I get it and I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with either way of feeling", "If you don't trust your sig other then why are you with them?", "Valid point on the ex but he didn\u2019t tell her to choose again. No one told her what to do she did it herself. Of course, they\u2019re going to blame the boyfriend, even though it was the girlfriend who did it because she did it herself.", "And tons of people cheat with exes. Removing temptations and obstacles is very healthy. Reddit is whack sometimes and there is just plain low emotional intelligence on average.", "No a boundary is normal and this is a normal boundary freaking hell a lot of females don\u2019t want their bfs to have girl best friends or even hang out with their female exs and would actually say drop them. What he said was just can you please do it with a group because feelings sexual ones to can spark when you spend lots of time one on one with someone you had relations with someone", "Lmao it's a super normal boundary. People are flawed and sometimes make poor and illogical decisions. It's reasonable to remove temptations and or possibly unhealthy things. Spending time alone with exes is a red flag for many. If there was a post about a new Gf hanging with an ex all the time, what would the answer be?", "They as in op and his partner", "Agreed. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be with someone who shares your same values. Thanks for the civil conversation", "But they have the same boundary. They communicated their feelings and what they think about it. And both agree to the same boundary. No one told her to drop him. She did that all by herself . If you\u2019re comfortable with your partner hanging out with his or her ex or hook up every now and then one on one that\u2019s you and that\u2019s OK it\u2019s your relationship but this relationship is don\u2019t hang out with your ex or your ex hook up and they both establish that boundary and accepted it.", "It's 100% not what's happening. Where did you take that from ? You must've read something else.", "The OP either trusts her or he doesn\u2019t. If there\u2019s a \u201c\u2026but\u201d then he doesn\u2019t actually trust her.", "The \"boundary\" is based on a lack of trust. I think they both don't trust each other and both should break up. It's not really about one of them being an asshole, it's that their relationship is without trust, therefore it's either toxic or doomed to fail. It would be best to either figure out why they don't trust the other and fix it or go their separate ways.", "So does his partner also not trust him if she has the same boundary towards him as well? Literally says in the post that the same boundary or rules apply to him. Each couple is different. If you\u2019re fine with your partner hanging out with his/her ex that\u2019s cool that\u2019s your relationship. But op and his partner have a boundary that they don\u2019t want them hanging out with her ex one on one.\n\nEdit: Plus his partner dropped the hook up her self. No one told her to do it.", "Oh yes, putting a boundary and talking about it and agreeing on it is very toxic. If you\u2019re OK with your partner going out with his or her ex then that\u2019s you but they ain\u2019t you. Like I said, no one told her to follow the boundaries she didn\u2019t have to agree to it. No one told her to drop him no one controlled her. No one said anything to her to do this and that. She did that all by herself.", "Sounds to me like the OP imposes that rule on himself. But it makes no difference. Anyone who says I trust you but not to be alone with your ex doesn\u2019t actually trust them.", "I mean, no one told the partner to drop her ex hook up. She did it herself. Besides, his partner understood the boundary, she didn\u2019t have to follow it."]}
