The teacher, Sasha, is very nice. I am normally all for my daughter cleaning her own messes.\n\nHowever, I find when I arrive, Sasha expects my daughter to finish cleaning up whatever she was playing with. Which again would be fine, but it delays us getting out the door and heading home, sometimes we have plans, etc. I started texting Sasha when I was so many minutes away, asking her to get my daughter ready and that seemed to work. My daughter would be in her jacket and reading a book, easy to put away vs a huge duplo project or similar. \n\nUntil today. Things were crazy and I was in a rush. We had a lot to do this afternoon and I was running behind because I had car trouble. When I arrived, my daughter and some friends were in the middle of cleaning up a big mess. I told my daughter that we had to go and to get her coat. Sasha said she needed to finish cleaning up her part. I said any other day, sure, but I am running late and we cannot miss this appointment. Sasha tried arguing that the kids need to learn responsibility and I flat out said no. I grabbed my daughter, put her coat on and left.\n\nAs I said, hectic afternoon so I only just now had time to check my texts. I had one from Sasha saying poor planning on my part doesn\u2019t mean I can break rules. I pointed out this is not in the contract and I can bring my child home whenever I need want. She accused me of undermining her authority. I was given \u201ca verbal warning\u201d which I found ridiculous.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679433756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xv2t8/aita_for_telling_my_childs_daycare_teacher_that/", "score": 920, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Messy play is for mornings or early afternoon. After 430 (or 5, depending on when your pickups start) is for quiet reading or screen time. Things you can drop and go.\n\nParents do not want to wait around for toys to be cleaned up. As a provider, I dont want to work late either. This is poor time management by the daycare provider.", "NTA. I completely agree with the dayhome teacher's sentiment, BUT it is your kid and you can leave whenever you damn well want. Just need to be kind and respectful about it.  Daycare pick up should not take 20 minutes. Working parents need to get home, run errands, make dinner, do extracurriculars, and then have quality time left with their children. That 20 minutes waiting around at daycare really cuts into a person's tight schedule.\n\nPerhaps the teacher should not allow messy or busy activities after 4:30 pm and instead encourage reading, larger simpler toys, or things that are easy to put away in a hurry.", "NTA i worked childcare and if you have a set time for pick up then theres no reason clean up cant be started before then. Then give the kid an activity that takes a few seconds to put away when you get there. Its common practice in most care centres for easy pick ups for both kids and parents as its harder to get the kid to put things away when the parents are there.", "Info: Depends on how regularly this occurs. The way you worded things makes me suspect this isn't the first time you've just grabbed your kid and gone.", "Info: do you pick the kid up at the same time every day?", "INFO: is there a pick-up time? If there is, it would be on the teacher to make sure your daughter is ready at the specific time. But of course, emergencies happen.", "NTA. The daycare should switch to quick clean up activities for her around pickup time. Unless you arrive at wildly different times every day, it should be pretty easy. The teacher should be more proactive. It\u2019s not fair for parents to wait while a kid cleans up a mess they made under someone else\u2019s care at 2 years old. Maybe when they are older but for a 2yr old it is the caregiver\u2019s choice what they do really. I\u2019m all for teaching clean up and not letting parents undermine to a point but they have to work with you.", "INFO: do you collect your daughter at wildly different times every day or around the same time?  \n\nIf it's the same time she should make sure any big/messy projects are cleared up in good time and have quiet reading time or similar at the end of the day. \n\nIf it's wildly different then you need to make sure you are keeping her informed.", "NTA - but would it be possible on days like this to let the teacher know \"daughter needs to leave by x-time because of an appointment\" so that she knows in advance that you will be picking her up and leaving by that time?  Not just texting ahead, but making it known that you will be out the door by a certain time, regardless of mess.", "YTA - not in general just for this one event, you could have called ahead and mentioned the urgency or even mentioned the appointment when you dropped your daughter off.", "YTA. Big-time. Rules are rules, no matter what. Imagine running a traffic light because you were running late. That isn't an excuse.\n\nImagine every child seeing this and saying \"she didn't have to clean up, why do i?\" Now, you have chaos.\n\nDo you expect everything to be in writing? Just because it isn't in the contract doesn't mean it isn't a rule.", "Anybody with half a brain would do messy activities early in the day and leave quiet non-messy ones for later on.", "As a childcare worker you're NTA. You would be if it was a regular thing but things happen. The daycare can't keep you there to clean up", "NTA. Assuming you're not picking up early or at random times without any warning, it's completely reasonable for clean-up to happen *before* pick-up time. I've never heard of this at any daycare (again, assuming pick-up time is consistent and/or known in advance).\n\nSorry OP, sounds super frustrating... I hope your car troubles are resolved. I think it's totally reasonable to kindly and respectfully request that your daughter be encouraged to participate in clean-up prior to pick up.", "It doesn't matter whether you're TA or not. What matters is whether or not you're willing to find a new care provider for your daughter. Her caregiver is telling you that your behavior was unacceptable to her and if it continues she will demand that you find somewhere else for your child.", "YTA. Sorry if this sounds rude, but seriously, way to begin teaching your kid that your/her time is more valuable than anyone else!  You're already starting this up by texting in requests to the teacher which I'm sure she finds annoying.\n\nNow I understand that sometimes our careers may have us booking it from here to there constantly.  I feel like I'm in a hurry every minute after getting out of bed. My child is in a similar program. So when I need to be somewhere at a certain time I pick her up earlier than usual to make up for the time she needs to clean up. Seriously, we're adults here.  Don't be surprised if they drop your kid from the program.", "NTA - once in a while things happen! The daycare lady was a bit power trippy.. if it were all the time then sure, but not for a first offence.", "NTA. I\u2019ve worked in multiple daycares and the way all the schools function where I am is by making the kids clean up before the day ends. After tidy up time, they all sit on the carpet for story time with all their things packed and ready to go 10 minutes before their parents pick them up. \n\nPoor management on the teacher\u2019s part.", "YTA. If you don't want to follow the home daycare rules then find another one.", "NTA. Sasha needs to be flexible on this rule when parents are in a rush. Or only allow certain toys at the end of the day that are easy to pick up.", "Um no. NTA. If you say you\u2019re leaving with your kid, you can leave. She can\u2019t keep her there until she decides your child can leave.", "YTA op. Poor planning all around on op's part and blatant lack of respect for the teacher.", "How was it an emergency? You had a car issue, so you were running late, but unless it was a last minute appointment related to something time sensitive, it wasn\u2019t an emergency. YTA", "NTA. It was a one off and you had an appointment. She is being ridiculous for making this an issue.", "INFO: I'm confused about the timeline, when were you supposed to pick her up? At what time? You said car trouble made you late. What is the timeline?\n\nDoes she start making the kids pick up right as they are supposed to leave? Does everyone leave at the same time?  \n\n\nAs it stands ESH, everyone should've been more flexible. The teacher as this was an emergency and you say you stay to clean up on other days so you aren't skipping clean up just because. You because there is no need to snap at the teacher who is just doing her job, I understand the need to be gone but it's not your fault or hers you were late.", "YTA. You knew the rules and decided that you didn't want to follow them. If you don't like it, find a new daycare.", "NTA. She's looking after your child, but she doesn't have \"authority\" over you. She's on a power trip", "NTA. It's a two-year old we're talking about. Brain isn't even wired to sequential activities and rules yet - discipline-lustful people here please get a grip.", "Idk judgment on this one but the daycare teacher is really dumb for saving pickup until the parent arrives. Even a smidgen of common sense on her part would have prevented any of this conflict.", "NTA. Now if this had been a regular occurrence the verdict would have been the opposite. \nBut it was clearly an exception to the rule and we are all human after all. \n\nSomeone working with kids should be the first to know that the old \u2018man plans, god laughs\u2019 is Very real. \n\nNow I wouldn\u2019t stir up the flames, but it does seem like she needs to be reminded that you are Not one of her students but an adult.", "NAH. You were late. They enforced the policy. Nobody is TA here. If you continue causing trouble with the staff, you will be TA though.", "YTA. If you knew you had an appointment you should have let Sasha know ahead of time. Cleaning up teaches the child responsibility and she got to leave her mess with the other kids who now have to clean it up. If you have plans, let the teacher know beforehand or when you are coming to pick up so she has reasonable time to get your child ready she has multiple other kids to care for not JUST yours.", "Former preschool teacher here-\n\nYTA\n\nMaintaining expectations or rules is important in a classroom. Teachers have a responsibility to hold boundaries with students. However, having flexibility for parents can only go so far. If you are showing up late or in a rush in a consistent pattern it's frustrating for teachers. I can understand this position, and having to deliver a \"verbal warning\". \n\nHowever, things happen on day to day, you being late can happen. Needing to go to an appointment can happen. Don't make it a habit to excuse your child from a responsibility when the teacher has already made a statement and is trying to hold a responsibility. This creates a power struggle and is uncomfortable for the teacher as well as yourself. Take time to apologize to her teacher, and make a verbal/written  plan for pickups.", "NTA. This is poor planning on the part of the daycare. If cleaning has to be done, Sasha needs to end the activity earlier to allocate time for cleanup. This is not school with detention to keep kids beyond the scheduled time. This is a paid service for your convenience.", "YTA. While I agree you can leave when you want but she\u2019s also entitled to expect your kid to clean up after herself and for you to follow rules. If I were her I would inform you today was your last day and to not return. She probably has families on a waitlist.", "YTA so the daycare woman is supposed to clean up and not teach the kids to clean up all the time? You being late doesn\u2019t make it an issue for the daycare provider. \nAll the NTA probably don\u2019t run a daycare from home. You were rude and owe her an apology", "NTA.\n\nThis is not a regular occurrence and as a society we need to be willing to be flexible (within reasonable limits).\n\nYWBTA if this were a regular occurrence", "NTA if it was a one off.  I would think there needs to be some flexibility as things happen.  You say it's a home daycare.  What happens if she wakes up sick.  Are you required to make other arrangements on a moments notice? \n\nDo you get there at approximately the same time everyday or do the arrival times vary significantly?", "Your first paragraph has an error. \u201cI am normally all for my daughter cleaning up her own messes, except when it\u2019s inconvenient for me, and then I\u2019m fine with making the help do it. I don\u2019t mind teaching her that she only has to clean up after herself when she feels like it.\u201d\n\nThere I fixed it for you. YTA.", "NTA if this is a one time thing and normally your system works. It is also important for kids to learn that things aren\u2019t always equal and that sometimes we can be good friends by picking up others\u2019 slack. In general, I would suggest making sure you allow a few more minutes at pickup for your daughter to finish her responsibilities.", "NTA. That's ridiculous.", "YTA. Your schedule problems are yours alone.", "NTA.  There are exceptions to every rule.  If you made a habit of letting your daughter slack, that would be different.  But on a day where you have got to go, you go.\n\n\\*ran family home day care for babies/toddlers and had 3 children go through pre-school.", "Mild YTA. OP is this really worth risking access to your daycare over? How easy is it going to be to get replacement daycare if you continue annoying Sasha? Daycares set these boundaries because if they didn\u2019t pickup would be a constant nightmare. I understand it was an emergency with car trouble bit you literally couldn\u2019t spare two minutes to call Sasha and give her a heads up?", "YTA , I don\u2019t know her rates but my in house daycare is way less than the other daycare facilities. So you may want to play nice. Also maybe try to picking up your kid around the same time everyday, that way a routine can be made.", "Mild YTA, sounded like a poor planning on OP\u2019s part, but again emergency does happen.", "very soft YTA - im a daycare teacher for toddlers and honestly clean up is pretty structured for them for good reason, they do really well with sticking by the rules and plans. one of kids not cleaning up often sets off more kids deciding not to, not that is necessarily on you but it truly does make a difference. i appreciate that fact that you were running late but tbh call or text ahead of time like you usually do! granted things happen but i think the walk away wasnt the right answer, it would probably have been more productive to go and help her clean up faster than just outright taking her", "Situations like this are why rules are made.  You found an easy compromise which was to call ahead when you wanted your daughter ready.  You didn't follow that and conflict happened. \n\nIMO, YTA.  If you push it, she could kick your daughter out.  Call it common courtesy,  but her house, her rules that it's run under.", "Info how late were you?", "YTA.  Also very short sighted.  You are using a home daycare - if the provider doesn't like you, you will lose your spot, and probably without enough notice to find somewhere else.  Play nice with the people you rely on, or you will have more to complain about than a hectic afternoon.", "NTA I get good to teach these things however occasion skipping it esp at 2 years old isn\u2019t a big deal.", "NTA, but don\u2019t lose your spot in the daycare! It sucks, but good daycares are hard to come by. I think you\u2019re gonna have to suck it up for your kid\u2019s sake\u2026", "One of the most important things to a child is consistency. OP, just because *you* were late doesn't make it an emergency for the daycare provider. I'd recommend better time management, better communication with the provider, and a lot more patience. NAH.", "YTA. because you know it\u2019s a rule for her to clean up before she leaves and you SHOULD plan better to make sure you\u2019re there earlier or you have time for her to clean up and get ready. It\u2019s not her teachers job to accommodate you by cleaning up your kids messes for her when you\u2019re in a rush. I don\u2019t think one time is a big deal, but yta because you know about it and have no respect for the rule.", "YTA. The point of childcare isn\u2019t just somewhere for you to dump your kid. It\u2019s to teach them the basics of what they need to do. Cleaning up after you\u2019re done with something is a core thing they teach.\n\nGet over yourself.", "I think YTA. You seem to think you can disrespect rules as you feel like. You seem rude and entitled. I don\u2019t get all the NTA votes. Everyone has to clean up at the end of the day. Why should it all fall on the teacher because you\u2019re running late and forgot to text her?", "YTA. The daycare worker was right.", "YTA because you were in a rush and didn\u2019t think to tell Sasha you needed your kid ready when you got there.

She should be understanding that things happen and that you can\u2019t be late to appointments so sacrifices need to be made- in this case the other kids had to clean a bit more. But you also need to understand that she makes rules and you and your child need to follow them. You know this a rule and you didn\u2019t text her to say you were on your way so that\u2019s on you. Next time all you have to say is \u201cI understand this is the rule but unfortunately I don\u2019t have time today to wait- I\u2019ll make sure to let you know I\u2019m on my way tomorrow so this isn\u2019t an issue\u201d but instead you got snippy which isn\u2019t ok.", "NTA, OP. Sasha is TA. Life has nuance. I get her rules, but this can\u2019t be the first time this has caused conflict for more parents than just yourself.

You already know that the way to resolve this is to let them know when you're on the way and they can get the kid ready. You failed to do that. Child care is hard to find, don't mess this up for yourself because you had a bad day. Apologize and try to do better tomorrow.", "NTA for rushing one day, but please do apologize to Sasha. In a non-defensive way. It sounds like YTA in the texts afterwards by arguing with her. Your best response would have been \"Sorry for being so short and rude the other day.\" + a compliment about her care.", "YTA,\n\nPart of daycare is to teach your kid. The teacher is right, poor planning on your part doesn't constitute an emergency on hers.\n\nShe has worked with you in the past, getting your panties all bunched up because you changed the rules that has been working is on you not her.\n\nWhy didn't you just help the kid clean up?", "YTA and good luck finding a new day care.

Teaching your kid that cleaning up is an important responsibility and that one should plan ahead to make that possible is paramount. Find a different daycare if you disagree. And for what's it's worth, your kid spends most of their awake time there, so spending 20 minutes picking up, connecting, talking, learning about your kid and this part of their socialization is valuable and shouldn't be rushed. Sounds like in-home isn't for you, send your child to a center.", "NTA a verbal warning? Please. Tell her your daughter needs to start clean up 15 minutes before pick up and you'll be taking her when you arrive.", "YTA. Good luck finding a new daycare when the teacher gives you the boot.", "NTA. Its your kid and she has no right to keep your kid from you in an emergency. Shit happens, but people like this just want to make things more complicated because they think they have power.

I would imagine that this teacher has an idea what time you show up every day, so I don't even see why the text is necessary. I get why you do it, but since she knows what time you are showing up anyway, I don't see why she wouldn't make sure your daughter is ready to go home.  Does your schedule change all the time so the teacher is not aware? I don't think one time not being able to stay for cleanup, which should have been done earlier, means you have poor time management. It sounds like this teacher is on some sort of power trip. She should try to help make things a little bit easier for a mother coming from work and trying to make an appointment. You'd think she could be a little more understanding.  I don't believe pick-up time is clean-up time unless you have some really wacky schedule.  You can take your child home whenever you please.  You never said it wasn't important to clean up all the other times, just that you need your kid ready to go, which is understandable.", "NTA- I\u2019m all for teaching children to clean up after themselves\u2026 and sometimes life happens.", "YTA. Teaching a kid they can bail on responsibilities isn't a good lesson. \n\nEveryone has bad days, but sometimes we need to hold it together, show respect to the people teaching our children, and not make a fool of ourselves.\n\nPointing to the contract is just pathetic, honestly.", "And your child's daycare teacher doesn't have things to do afterward? She has a bunch of other kids to look after and help out in addition to her own life to get to.

The provider needs to be better organised.", "YTA\n\nYou taught her your own personal needs come above responsibility. Which ironically you showed in your your post", "YTA. How someone can write this and not read it over and go \"wow, I should delete this because I'm an AH\" is beyond me.   \n\n\nIt shouldn't have to be in the contract that your kid learn basic life skills. My friend's 3 year old was taught to always clean up before he even gets to have lunch or dinner. You play, you're done, you clean, you get to move on to something else. You're teaching your kid that they can do whatever they want and someone else can clean up. I can see what our future looks like if everyone's kids were taught this.   \n\n\nIf you have a 5pm appointment and you pick up your kid so you might be late or not make it, it's on YOU. If you have a 5pm appointment and it takes 20 minutes from daycare, maybe go pick up your kid at 4:15pm, let her clean up for 15 minutes and you're still 10 minutes early to your 5pm appointment. Scheduling is YOUR job.   \n\n\nI hope you can reflect back on all the answers here and realize that even if something isn't in the contract, teaching your child how to be a decent person in society is YOUR job. From the looks of it, I suggest a little more consideration and respect for others. I would hate your kid to have a reputation at school because they're taking habits and attitudes learned from you at home and being iced out by other kids over it - no one wants that to happen. Teaching your kid to pitch in, being a little bit late for doing the right thing, and doing her part are all important things to impart.

The teacher, Sasha, is very nice. I am normally all for my daughter cleaning her own messes.\n\nHowever, I find when I arrive, Sasha expects my daughter to finish cleaning up whatever she was playing with. Which again would be fine, but it delays us getting out the door and heading home, sometimes we have plans, etc. I started texting Sasha when I was so many minutes away, asking her to get my daughter ready and that seemed to work. My daughter would be in her jacket and reading a book, easy to put away vs a huge duplo project or similar. \n\nUntil today. Things were crazy and I was in a rush. We had a lot to do this afternoon and I was running behind because I had car trouble. When I arrived, my daughter and some friends were in the middle of cleaning up a big mess. I told my daughter that we had to go and to get her coat. Sasha said she needed to finish cleaning up her part. I said any other day, sure, but I am running late and we cannot miss this appointment. Sasha tried arguing that the kids need to learn responsibility and I flat out said no. I grabbed my daughter, put her coat on and left.\n\nAs I said, hectic afternoon so I only just now had time to check my texts. I had one from Sasha saying poor planning on my part doesn\u2019t mean I can break rules. I pointed out this is not in the contract and I can bring my child home whenever I need want. She accused me of undermining her authority. I was given \u201ca verbal warning\u201d which I found ridiculous.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There were plenty of times I had to wait for a couple of minutes for my daughter to clean up, the 2-3 minutes it took were not that detrimental to my schedule, seems like the parent was just being petty.

Not once in like 10 years altogether. Two different home daycares too. Sometimes picking them up took like 10 minutes though because I enjoyed talking to their teachers about their day and a kid can really draw out putting on a coat for a full 7-8 minutes if they feel like it.

Hard to say if it's an usual time without knowing if the schedule is consistent or she texts in advance because her pickup time varies a lot. \n\nMy kid's current school is very flexible about pickup and drop-off times, which is great for me. But if I showed up earlier than 10 minutes prior to pickup time without giving advanced notice, no way would I expect my kid to be ready to go.

I see no reason why the issue of cleaning up a big mess isn't thought out ahead of time. This isn't something a toddler is expected to understand. Sasha should clean up as much as a parent would be cleaning up because Sasha is getting paid to stand in place of the parent for a period of time.\n\n I'm surprised by the number of people thinking that parents should have to wait for cleanup activities after they show up to pick up their kid.

Parents can be extremely disrespectful of their children\u2019s caretakers. Coming late, not providing supplies, etc. When parents use a daycare or private education service, it\u2019s not a one-way, the customer is always right street. Parents can be dropped for poor behavior. So a \u201cverbal warning\u201d makes sense here to a degree. It\u2019s indicating that it\u2019s unacceptable from the practice\u2019s perspective and they may be dropped as a client.\n\nI\u2019m going with NAH because I can see where this was bad from both perspectives. I think it was more of a bad miscommunication than anything else.", "That wasn't even close to the case. Pretty sure the daycare would have responded differently if the child was injured, so this is an absurd strawman.", "Absolutely. But OP did not have an emergency. They had an appointment and failed to leave early enough to make it, considering their other responsibilities.", "What a joke of a comment. She didn\u2019t say there was an emergency either she said she had an appointment to go to and she was running late so she should\u2019ve texted the teacher to let her know.

She didn't do it this time, even though this time they needed to leave by x time. And why are you assuming OP wasn't arriving without warning before this? Doesn't it make more sense for the child care provider to try to get the kids ready for pick up rather than deal with the chaos when they arrive and aren't ready and then the entitled attitude coming from people like OP? The way this is written, I'm more inclined to believe OP shows up at different times daily and her child care provider has had to deal with her being snippy when her child isn't magically ready. I'm giving my benefit of the doubt to the child care provider. And I hope she finds a less entitled client whose children will grow up to be better people.", "Lmaooooo a professional is going to have the kids end activities early to what, twiddle thumbs??

There\u2019s no way I\u2019d be having them clean up while parents are arriving to pick them up.

My youngest is starting to love numbers and I can't wait to check this out.", "My friend's kid is obsessed with that as well, but screen time at a nursery? I know at home is probably different. Our nursery/day care, I think the older ones get basic coding classes at around 4, but that's the only time they get with devices (\"coding\".. as in make the toy or character move I think). It's all books, movement, crafts and outdoor or messy play, plus some French. That and eating crackers off the floor.", "Same, I worked in childcare centres and we would've never used screen time, even at the end of the day when only one staff was left with the last couple kids. Maybe an audiobook or something but usually it was just trying to lead the kids towards the same toys or activities so it was easier to clean up when the last kid left.", "Its a *home* daycare. Typically set up different than regular daycares, including pricing.", "During normal hours yes. But a lot of places charge per minute after a certain time, mostly to discourage parents being late for pick up and holding the teacher 30+ minutes after closing.", "Unless parents are late with pickup.

But I pick my kid up anywhere from 345pm to 445pm. The teacher can\u2019t plan to have the kids clean at a set time because most parents don\u2019t pick their kid up at exactly the same time everyday or don\u2019t leave them there until closing time.\n\nEdit to add: even if the parents give an approximation of the time they\u2019ll pick their kid up, the teacher can\u2019t have the kids pick up too early because at that age, the kid isn\u2019t likely to just sit there quietly and wait without making another mess.", "Which means no set time. Obviously you never heard of a schedule so if she gets there at 5:00 she is there at 5:00 even if you add or subtract 5 minutes to that time. No she is texting the daycare to tell them when she will be there, to me that means no set time. \n\nThe provider is taking care of the child, and keeping her entertained. The provider not given notice by the texting of the client's mother did not have a set time.  If you read down in the comments you find that she didn't text the provider because of car trouble that set her back. Yeah as she waits she can't say hey I am running late my car just got repaired will be there in x minutes. She chose not to think about that and think her child doesn't have follow the rules.", "Yes and the reason why is because she doesn't actually have a set schedule. If you start something keep to it.", "Exactly this. When my kids went to daycare, the provider had them tidying up 15 minutes before pickup time. If they finished before pickup time, they were allowed to grab a book or something simple to put away until my wife arrived to pick them up.\n\nNTA OP, however you may have to think about switching providers as ultimately, the provider does not have to keep you as a client.", ">Sometimes picking them up took like 10 minutes though because I enjoyed talking to their teachers about their day\n\nHeh I used to come and pick up at nap time and just sit on the couch, petting the daycare lady's cat and talking to her. It got to the point the cat would look irritated if I didn't sit down with her. Good daycare people are awesome to hang around with", "So because this ONE time OP needed to get moving quickly for an appointment and couldn\u2019t stay to clean up, she needs to be ridiculed and given a \u201cverbal warning\u201d?   Stop it.  \n\nIf this was a regular occurrence, sure.  That\u2019s rude and unacceptable.  Sometimes as a working parent, however, you literally are just racing from one thing to the next and will occasionally let something slip.

Cleanup should be happening way earlier. This is not how a daycare should be run.", "I work in the field, cleaning up at the end of the day is in their job description.

Sorry but this makes no sense and she does not need to apologize. Sasha is the one who isn\u2019t managing her time well.

From what she said she explained the situation and Sasha wanted to be petty.", "Lashed out????", "It's both.

It's good to learn to clean up, but it's not a card that trumps all other considerations in life.", "Op didn't fail to ealve early enough. Op had car troubles. How is that their fault or poor time management at all? NTA", "Daycare is usually notified of pick up time so the teacher should have the child ready to leave at the pick up time. The parent shouldn\u2019t be waiting on a 2 year old to slowly pick up a big mess or the teacher should quickly help pick up the mess so they aren\u2019t waiting as long.", "How about ending activities early to clean up the mess for the rest of the time, if it's that big? In regular school, that bus will leave whether the classroom is clean or not. I think the teacher needs to plan better.", "She said she picked her up an hour before the daycare closes, not that she was there early.", "Surely screen time is better than floor crackers?", "It sounds like this was during normal hours though.", "I get that for a larger daycare with a bunch of kids throughout the day, but it sounds to me that this is an at-home daycare with one teacher which should legally only have a few kids. I suppose I just don't understand why they couldn't busied with smaller projects in the afternoon, or have them do outside play where there's little to no pick up at all. I don't think having them sit and read books would really work for kids that age, but even something like coloring could be easily put down towards the end of the day when pick ups start to happen.", "Which is why op texted the teacher in advance so this wouldn\u2019t happen. Just because daycare lady can\u2019t manage time management well should constitute ops appointment especially with advanced notice", "This was my thought too. It was one specific day, the teacher knows she usually always gets a text. This is the kind of thing where teacher should be able to see a particularly stressed parent that day and give some grace and just help get the child out the door quickly.  She could even add in a \"we can all help clean up so our friend X can go\" or whatever to promote with the kids that sometimes you just chip in extra to help your friends and it doesn't have to be perfectly fair every day.", "I understand your point. However, I also understand the point the owner is making. Basically, a \u201cpaper trail\u201d might need to be started in case this does become a (semi) regular occurrence. \n\nI\u2019ve always been a working parent and fully understand the OP\u2019s frustrations and aggravations. We all have days like those. However, at the end of the day, the OP\u2019s issues were not the daycare owner\u2019s issues. The OP admits that there was no communication regarding the appointment. I know that I always let my child care providers know when we had an appointment and had to be out of there by a certain time. \n\nPerhaps the OP could speak to the daycare provider about making sure the child is ready to go by a specific time every day the child is there. If the child needs something to do while waiting, perhaps it could be watching something on a tablet or TV.", "May I ask if you work in a home daycare setting or another type of setting? All I know is that my kids were in home daycare settings, and we always communicated regarding what time my child would be picked up. If I were running late, I\u2019d always call her (this was before texting). That way, she\u2019d know if my kid(s) would be there for snack, lunch, nap, etc. \n\nI guess my experience is just very different than many others.", "No, but it's also rude for a parent to grab their kid and leave their mess. I tell my kids \"clean up so you can go\" and in 8 years have never had a complaint from a parent. If a kid slips past, their parents know to turn them around so they can clean up. \nUnderstandably it was a special circumstance, but that's on op.", "She told her off", "False. Source: I've been in childcare for 20 years, worked as an inhome provider during that time.", "False. Source: I've been in childcare for 20 years, worked as an inhome provider during that time.", "Really? Is your name Sasha?", "They can and pretty quickly once warnings have been given.", "The rules did not indicate she had to communicate that time.  She was just doing it.", "She should have to in the first place. OP isn\u2019t picking up their child early or randomly. Sasha should have the children ready at pick up and that\u2019s that.", "You think wrong again she wield's no authority not over the child not over the mother. She has power. Power to choose not to work for them and provide care.   \n\n\nIf you want to call that power then so be it. The same power a McDonalds worker has to leave their shift if they are unhappy and go apply elsewhere.  \n\n\nIt's still not authority.", "probably, but from the post it sounded like there were multiple children cleaning up to leave so idk.", "OP says they text daily on their way. If they had a usual time, that wouldn\u2019t be necessary. Sounds like pickup varies. That\u2019s not Sasha\u2019s fault or responsibility.", "Being good at your job means keeping children entertained and having fun and learning through play. Not sitting and staring out windows hoping mom will be on time.", "No indication that this is happening in this case. I dislike it when people build this whole idea of things based on something that may or may not even be taking place.", "And I have a feeling OP is hiding information to make himself look better. There was still an hour left in daycare, so OP was early. He never warned the daycare he was picking his daughter up early, because in the past he even admits that when given notice his daughter is ready to go with something easy to put away. This is all on OP.", "That's not what happened. Tidying up didn't \"wait\" it was done by the teacher and other kids without any help from OP's daughter. That's not learning flexibility, just learning how to drop your responsibilities onto others", "One cannot reasonably expect someone handling a full class of kids to be exactly on schedule at any minute. Kids could be ready and spill something and she'd have to start again.\n\nIt's on OP to plan their time accordingly. OP says themselves they were running late. If you have an appointment at 5 fifteen minutes away, you don't show up at 4:45 to pick up your kid .", "It's really not that hard to leave your self with enough time that if something goes wrong, like car troubles, you still won't be late.\n\nIt's poor time management to plan for everything to go perfectly.", "I\u2019m not saying OP is the AH. But we don\u2019t have info on how many kids there are. Even an at home daycare could have 8-10 easily assuming they are bothering to comply with the law or that there are laws at all on this where OP lives. I\u2019m just saying that the pre clean up plan or trying to convince a 2 year old to play a specific thing or limit their play might not necessarily work in every situation.", "This is a great point.  Yes, kids need to be taught responsibility and learn to take ownership.  But that could have also been a great teaching moment of friendship and helping when needed.", "There it is! The absolute disrespect towards the people who CARE FOR YOUR CHILDREN! You absolutely need us more than we need you. Sasha can easily fill this child\u2019s place. \n\nWhen we have the courage of the French, I\u2019m going to put you to the guillotine first!", "Or does it teach you to pick up the slack for others when they need your help and hopefully they do the same when you\u2019re the one who needs the slack? It won\u2019t always be an equal contribution from everyone. Life doesn\u2019t work that way", "Nope. A good provider will have everything done, barring no accidents, at pickup time.", "That's way, way above what a 4yo understands from \"teacher said to clean after ourselves but daddy says i don't have to\".", "But there\u2019s clearly not one set pickup time", "Is that the only way to explain the situation? Teacher could say Mary needs to leave early, so she\u2019s going to need a little extra help from us today. We\u2019ll do her part just for the day, and she\u2019ll help clean up the mess next time. The same way you\u2019d explain why a kid can\u2019t help because he\u2019s sick.", "she said the daycare was open for another hour, which means the daycare closed in a hour. that means it was the end of the day, usually smart daycare owners pull out books, put on tv for screen time and big, easy to clean up toys. usually they\u2019ll have the kids clean up the first 15-20 mins in the beginning of the last hour and let the kids chill for the rest of the time.", "This is so easy. Sasha does daycare of a living. This is her JOB. Clean up starts at 3pm- easy cleanup activities after 3pm only. There\u2019s no reason for her not to have this very simple rule where everyone wins and there\u2019s no confusion. That\u2019s good planning on the person running the business. \n\nNot only that but once-in-a-while emergencies should be allowed by parents. Not everyone\u2019s lives are perfect and it\u2019s bound to happen. Verbal warnings are for: if this happened frequently, not for real emergencies that are bound to happen once in a very blue moon, and with actual good planning on Sasha\u2019s end\u2026.. then in this case Sasha is doing everything she can but parents are being disrespectful. Sasha is accusing of poor planning while poorly planning. \n\nLook at what other daycare providers wrote in the comment section. They know better than to plan messy shit at 4-5pm. Sasha can plan better.", "In the beginning of the last hour - so yeah, based on all accounts, it makes sense why there was something to clean up with still an hour to go before close."]}
