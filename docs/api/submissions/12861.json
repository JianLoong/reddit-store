The teacher, Sasha, is very nice. I am normally all for my daughter cleaning her own messes.\n\nHowever, I find when I arrive, Sasha expects my daughter to finish cleaning up whatever she was playing with. Which again would be fine, but it delays us getting out the door and heading home, sometimes we have plans, etc. I started texting Sasha when I was so many minutes away, asking her to get my daughter ready and that seemed to work. My daughter would be in her jacket and reading a book, easy to put away vs a huge duplo project or similar. \n\nUntil today. Things were crazy and I was in a rush. We had a lot to do this afternoon and I was running behind because I had car trouble. When I arrived, my daughter and some friends were in the middle of cleaning up a big mess. I told my daughter that we had to go and to get her coat. Sasha said she needed to finish cleaning up her part. I said any other day, sure, but I am running late and we cannot miss this appointment. Sasha tried arguing that the kids need to learn responsibility and I flat out said no. I grabbed my daughter, put her coat on and left.\n\nAs I said, hectic afternoon so I only just now had time to check my texts. I had one from Sasha saying poor planning on my part doesn\u2019t mean I can break rules. I pointed out this is not in the contract and I can bring my child home whenever I need want. She accused me of undermining her authority. I was given \u201ca verbal warning\u201d which I found ridiculous.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679433756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xv2t8/aita_for_telling_my_childs_daycare_teacher_that/", "score": 6098, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Messy play is for mornings or early afternoon. After 430 (or 5, depending on when your pickups start) is for quiet reading or screen time. Things you can drop and go.\n\nParents do not want to wait around for toys to be cleaned up. As a provider, I dont want to work late either. This is poor time management by the daycare provider.", "NTA. I completely agree with the dayhome teacher's sentiment, BUT it is your kid and you can leave whenever you damn well want. Just need to be kind and respectful about it.  Daycare pick up should not take 20 minutes. Working parents need to get home, run errands, make dinner, do extracurriculars, and then have quality time left with their children. That 20 minutes waiting around at daycare really cuts into a person's tight schedule.\n\nPerhaps the teacher should not allow messy or busy activities after 4:30 pm and instead encourage reading, larger simpler toys, or things that are easy to put away in a hurry.", "NTA i worked childcare and if you have a set time for pick up then theres no reason clean up cant be started before then. Then give the kid an activity that takes a few seconds to put away when you get there. Its common practice in most care centres for easy pick ups for both kids and parents as its harder to get the kid to put things away when the parents are there.", "Info: Depends on how regularly this occurs. The way you worded things makes me suspect this isn't the first time you've just grabbed your kid and gone.", "Info: do you pick the kid up at the same time every day?\n\nETA: 1. The answer is no. OP picks the kid up at different times every day. \n\n2. This is relevant information because so many people seemed surprised that the kid hadn't cleaned up already, but that would be impossible as the caregiver had no idea when OP would arrive. \n\nTaking advantage of flexible pick up times means following the rules for flexible pick up times, which clearly includes kids cleaning up before they go. OP wanted to ignore the rules because they didn\u2019t take 10 seconds to text they were on the way.  That's an AH move.", "INFO: is there a pick-up time? If there is, it would be on the teacher to make sure your daughter is ready at the specific time. But of course, emergencies happen.", "NTA. The daycare should switch to quick clean up activities for her around pickup time. Unless you arrive at wildly different times every day, it should be pretty easy. The teacher should be more proactive. It\u2019s not fair for parents to wait while a kid cleans up a mess they made under someone else\u2019s care at 2 years old. Maybe when they are older but for a 2yr old it is the caregiver\u2019s choice what they do really. I\u2019m all for teaching clean up and not letting parents undermine to a point but they have to work with you.", "INFO: do you collect your daughter at wildly different times every day or around the same time?  \n\nIf it's the same time she should make sure any big/messy projects are cleared up in good time and have quiet reading time or similar at the end of the day. \n\nIf it's wildly different then you need to make sure you are keeping her informed.", "NTA - but would it be possible on days like this to let the teacher know \"daughter needs to leave by x-time because of an appointment\" so that she knows in advance that you will be picking her up and leaving by that time?  Not just texting ahead, but making it known that you will be out the door by a certain time, regardless of mess.", "YTA - not in general just for this one event, you could have called ahead and mentioned the urgency or even mentioned the appointment when you dropped your daughter off.", "YTA. Big-time. Rules are rules, no matter what. Imagine running a traffic light because you were running late. That isn't an excuse.\n\nImagine every child seeing this and saying \"she didn't have to clean up, why do i?\" Now, you have chaos.\n\nDo you expect everything to be in writing? Just because it isn't in the contract doesn't mean it isn't a rule.", "Anybody with half a brain would do messy activities early in the day and leave quiet non-messy ones for later on.", "As a childcare worker you're NTA. You would be if it was a regular thing but things happen. The daycare can't keep you there to clean up", "NTA. Assuming you're not picking up early or at random times without any warning, it's completely reasonable for clean-up to happen *before* pick-up time. I've never heard of this at any daycare (again, assuming pick-up time is consistent and/or known in advance).\n\nSorry OP, sounds super frustrating... I hope your car troubles are resolved. I think it's totally reasonable to kindly and respectfully request that your daughter be encouraged to participate in clean-up prior to pick up.", "It doesn't matter whether you're TA or not. What matters is whether or not you're willing to find a new care provider for your daughter. Her caregiver is telling you that your behavior was unacceptable to her and if it continues she will demand that you find somewhere else for your child.", "YTA. Sorry if this sounds rude, but seriously, way to begin teaching your kid that your/her time is more valuable than anyone else!  You're already starting this up by texting in requests to the teacher which I'm sure she finds annoying.\n\nNow I understand that sometimes our careers may have us booking it from here to there constantly.  I feel like I'm in a hurry every minute after getting out of bed. My child is in a similar program. So when I need to be somewhere at a certain time I pick her up earlier than usual to make up for the time she needs to clean up. Seriously, we're adults here.  Don't be surprised if they drop your kid from the program.", "NTA - once in a while things happen! The daycare lady was a bit power trippy.. if it were all the time then sure, but not for a first offence.", "NTA. I\u2019ve worked in multiple daycares and the way all the schools function where I am is by making the kids clean up before the day ends. After tidy up time, they all sit on the carpet for story time with all their things packed and ready to go 10 minutes before their parents pick them up. \n\nPoor management on the teacher\u2019s part.", "YTA. If you don't want to follow the home daycare rules then find another one.", "NTA. Sasha needs to be flexible on this rule when parents are in a rush. Or only allow certain toys at the end of the day that are easy to pick up.", "Um no. NTA. If you say you\u2019re leaving with your kid, you can leave. She can\u2019t keep her there until she decides your child can leave.", "YTA op. Poor planning all around on op's part and blatant lack of respect for the teacher.", "How was it an emergency? You had a car issue, so you were running late, but unless it was a last minute appointment related to something time sensitive, it wasn\u2019t an emergency. YTA", "NTA. It was a one off and you had an appointment. She is being ridiculous for making this an issue.", "INFO: I'm confused about the timeline, when were you supposed to pick her up? At what time? You said car trouble made you late. What is the timeline?\n\nDoes she start making the kids pick up right as they are supposed to leave? Does everyone leave at the same time?  \n\n\nAs it stands ESH, everyone should've been more flexible. The teacher as this was an emergency and you say you stay to clean up on other days so you aren't skipping clean up just because. You because there is no need to snap at the teacher who is just doing her job, I understand the need to be gone but it's not your fault or hers you were late.", "YTA. You knew the rules and decided that you didn't want to follow them. If you don't like it, find a new daycare.", "NTA. She's looking after your child, but she doesn't have \"authority\" over you. She's on a power trip", "NTA. It's a two-year old we're talking about. Brain isn't even wired to sequential activities and rules yet - discipline-lustful people here please get a grip.", "Idk judgment on this one but the daycare teacher is really dumb for saving pickup until the parent arrives. Even a smidgen of common sense on her part would have prevented any of this conflict.", "NTA. Now if this had been a regular occurrence the verdict would have been the opposite. \nBut it was clearly an exception to the rule and we are all human after all. \n\nSomeone working with kids should be the first to know that the old \u2018man plans, god laughs\u2019 is Very real. \n\nNow I wouldn\u2019t stir up the flames, but it does seem like she needs to be reminded that you are Not one of her students but an adult.", "NAH. You were late. They enforced the policy. Nobody is TA here. If you continue causing trouble with the staff, you will be TA though.", "YTA. If you knew you had an appointment you should have let Sasha know ahead of time. Cleaning up teaches the child responsibility and she got to leave her mess with the other kids who now have to clean it up. If you have plans, let the teacher know beforehand or when you are coming to pick up so she has reasonable time to get your child ready she has multiple other kids to care for not JUST yours.", "Former preschool teacher here-\n\nYTA\n\nMaintaining expectations or rules is important in a classroom. Teachers have a responsibility to hold boundaries with students. However, having flexibility for parents can only go so far. If you are showing up late or in a rush in a consistent pattern it's frustrating for teachers. I can understand this position, and having to deliver a \"verbal warning\". \n\nHowever, things happen on day to day, you being late can happen. Needing to go to an appointment can happen. Don't make it a habit to excuse your child from a responsibility when the teacher has already made a statement and is trying to hold a responsibility. This creates a power struggle and is uncomfortable for the teacher as well as yourself. Take time to apologize to her teacher, and make a verbal/written  plan for pickups.", "NTA. This is poor planning on the part of the daycare. If cleaning has to be done, Sasha needs to end the activity earlier to allocate time for cleanup. This is not school with detention to keep kids beyond the scheduled time. This is a paid service for your convenience.", "YTA. While I agree you can leave when you want but she\u2019s also entitled to expect your kid to clean up after herself and for you to follow rules. If I were her I would inform you today was your last day and to not return. She probably has families on a waitlist.", "YTA so the daycare woman is supposed to clean up and not teach the kids to clean up all the time? You being late doesn\u2019t make it an issue for the daycare provider. \nAll the NTA probably don\u2019t run a daycare from home.

I would think there needs to be some flexibility as things happen.  You say it's a home daycare.  What happens if she wakes up sick.  Are you required to make other arrangements on a moments notice? \n\nDo you get there at approximately the same time everyday or do the arrival times vary significantly?", "Your first paragraph has an error. \u201cI am normally all for my daughter cleaning up her own messes, except when it\u2019s inconvenient for me, and then I\u2019m fine with making the help do it. I don\u2019t mind teaching her that she only has to clean up after herself when she feels like it.\u201d\n\nThere I fixed it for you. YTA.", "NTA if this is a one time thing and normally your system works. It is also important for kids to learn that things aren\u2019t always equal and that sometimes we can be good friends by picking up others\u2019 slack. In general, I would suggest making sure you allow a few more minutes at pickup for your daughter to finish her responsibilities.", "NTA. That's ridiculous.", "YTA. Your schedule problems are yours alone.", "NTA.  There are exceptions to every rule.  If you made a habit of letting your daughter slack, that would be different.  But on a day where you have got to go, you go.\n\n\\*ran family home day care for babies/toddlers and had 3 children go through pre-school.", "Mild YTA. OP is this really worth risking access to your daycare over? How easy is it going to be to get replacement daycare if you continue annoying Sasha? Daycares set these boundaries because if they didn\u2019t pickup would be a constant nightmare. I understand it was an emergency with car trouble bit you literally couldn\u2019t spare two minutes to call Sasha and give her a heads up?", "YTA , I don\u2019t know her rates but my in house daycare is way less than the other daycare facilities. So you may want to play nice. Also maybe try to picking up your kid around the same time everyday, that way a routine can be made.", "Mild YTA, sounded like a poor planning on OP\u2019s part, but again emergency does happen.", "very soft YTA - im a daycare teacher for toddlers and honestly clean up is pretty structured for them for good reason, they do really well with sticking by the rules and plans. one of kids not cleaning up often sets off more kids deciding not to, not that is necessarily on you but it truly does make a difference. i appreciate that fact that you were running late but tbh call or text ahead of time like you usually do! granted things happen but i think the walk away wasnt the right answer, it would probably have been more productive to go and help her clean up faster than just outright taking her", "Situations like this are why rules are made.  You found an easy compromise which was to call ahead when you wanted your daughter ready.  You didn't follow that and conflict happened. \n\nIMO, YTA.  If you push it, she could kick your daughter out.  Call it common courtesy,  but her house, her rules that it's run under.", "Info how late were you?", "YTA.  Also very short sighted.  You are using a home daycare - if the provider doesn't like you, you will lose your spot, and probably without enough notice to find somewhere else.  Play nice with the people you rely on, or you will have more to complain about than a hectic afternoon.", "NTA I get good to teach these things however occasion skipping it esp at 2 years old isn\u2019t a big deal.", "NTA, but don\u2019t lose your spot in the daycare!

You seem to think you can disrespect rules as you feel like. You seem rude and entitled. I don\u2019t get all the NTA votes. Everyone has to clean up at the end of the day.

Teaching your kid that cleaning up is an important responsibility and that one should plan ahead to make that possible is paramount. Find a different daycare if you disagree. And for what's it's worth, your kid spends most of their awake time there, so spending 20 minutes picking up, connecting, talking, learning about your kid and this part of their socialization is valuable and shouldn't be rushed.

I would imagine that this teacher has an idea what time you show up every day, so I don't even see why the text is necessary. I get why you do it, but since she knows what time you are showing up anyway, I don't see why she wouldn't make sure your daughter is ready to go home.  Does your schedule change all the time so the teacher is not aware? I don't think one time not being able to stay for cleanup, which should have been done earlier, means you have poor time management. It sounds like this teacher is on some sort of power trip. She should try to help make things a little bit easier for a mother coming from work and trying to make an appointment. You'd think she could be a little more understanding.  I don't believe pick-up time is clean-up time unless you have some really wacky schedule.  You can take your child home whenever you please.

How someone can write this and not read it over and go \"wow, I should delete this because I'm an AH\" is beyond me.   \n\n\nIt shouldn't have to be in the contract that your kid learn basic life skills. My friend's 3 year old was taught to always clean up before he even gets to have lunch or dinner. You play, you're done, you clean, you get to move on to something else. You're teaching your kid that they can do whatever they want and someone else can clean up. I can see what our future looks like if everyone's kids were taught this.   \n\n\nIf you have a 5pm appointment and you pick up your kid so you might be late or not make it, it's on YOU. If you have a 5pm appointment and it takes 20 minutes from daycare, maybe go pick up your kid at 4:15pm, let her clean up for 15 minutes and you're still 10 minutes early to your 5pm appointment. Scheduling is YOUR job.   \n\n\nI hope you can reflect back on all the answers here and realize that even if something isn't in the contract, teaching your child how to be a decent person in society is YOUR job. From the looks of it, I suggest a little more consideration and respect for others. I would hate your kid to have a reputation at school because they're taking habits and attitudes learned from you at home and being iced out by other kids over it - no one wants that to happen.

The teacher, Sasha, is very nice. I am normally all for my daughter cleaning her own messes.\n\nHowever, I find when I arrive, Sasha expects my daughter to finish cleaning up whatever she was playing with. Which again would be fine, but it delays us getting out the door and heading home, sometimes we have plans, etc. I started texting Sasha when I was so many minutes away, asking her to get my daughter ready and that seemed to work. My daughter would be in her jacket and reading a book, easy to put away vs a huge duplo project or similar. \n\nUntil today. Things were crazy and I was in a rush. We had a lot to do this afternoon and I was running behind because I had car trouble. When I arrived, my daughter and some friends were in the middle of cleaning up a big mess. I told my daughter that we had to go and to get her coat. Sasha said she needed to finish cleaning up her part. I said any other day, sure, but I am running late and we cannot miss this appointment. Sasha tried arguing that the kids need to learn responsibility and I flat out said no. I grabbed my daughter, put her coat on and left.\n\nAs I said, hectic afternoon so I only just now had time to check my texts. I had one from Sasha saying poor planning on my part doesn\u2019t mean I can break rules. I pointed out this is not in the contract and I can bring my child home whenever I need want. She accused me of undermining her authority. I was given \u201ca verbal warning\u201d which I found ridiculous.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You need to recognize that 2 year olds operate on their own SLOW timeline and build more time into your transitions. \n2. By saying no and grabbing your daughter to leave, you undermined and disrespected someone who works very hard to care for your daughter. \n3.

There were plenty of times I had to wait for a couple of minutes for my daughter to clean up, the 2-3 minutes it took were not that detrimental to my schedule, seems like the parent was just being petty.

Hard to say if it's an usual time without knowing if the schedule is consistent or she texts in advance because her pickup time varies a lot. \n\nMy kid's current school is very flexible about pickup and drop-off times, which is great for me. But if I showed up earlier than 10 minutes prior to pickup time without giving advanced notice, no way would I expect my kid to be ready to go.

I see no reason why the issue of cleaning up a big mess isn't thought out ahead of time. This isn't something a toddler is expected to understand. Sasha should clean up as much as a parent would be cleaning up because Sasha is getting paid to stand in place of the parent for a period of time.\n\n I'm surprised by the number of people thinking that parents should have to wait for cleanup activities after they show up to pick up their kid.

Coming late, not providing supplies, etc. When parents use a daycare or private education service, it\u2019s not a one-way, the customer is always right street.

She didn't do it this time, even though this time they needed to leave by x time. And why are you assuming OP wasn't arriving without warning before this? Doesn't it make more sense for the child care provider to try to get the kids ready for pick up rather than deal with the chaos when they arrive and aren't ready and then the entitled attitude coming from people like OP? The way this is written, I'm more inclined to believe OP shows up at different times daily and her child care provider has had to deal with her being snippy when her child isn't magically ready.

That and eating crackers off the floor.", "Same, I worked in childcare centres and we would've never used screen time, even at the end of the day when only one staff was left with the last couple kids.

The teacher can\u2019t plan to have the kids clean at a set time because most parents don\u2019t pick their kid up at exactly the same time everyday or don\u2019t leave them there until closing time.\n\nEdit to add: even if the parents give an approximation of the time they\u2019ll pick their kid up, the teacher can\u2019t have the kids pick up too early because at that age, the kid isn\u2019t likely to just sit there quietly and wait without making another mess.", "Which means no set time. Obviously you never heard of a schedule so if she gets there at 5:00 she is there at 5:00 even if you add or subtract 5 minutes to that time. No she is texting the daycare to tell them when she will be there, to me that means no set time. \n\nThe provider is taking care of the child, and keeping her entertained. The provider not given notice by the texting of the client's mother did not have a set time.  If you read down in the comments you find that she didn't text the provider because of car trouble that set her back. Yeah as she waits she can't say hey I am running late my car just got repaired will be there in x minutes. She chose not to think about that and think her child doesn't have follow the rules.", "Yes and the reason why is because she doesn't actually have a set schedule. If you start something keep to it.", "Exactly this. When my kids went to daycare, the provider had them tidying up 15 minutes before pickup time. If they finished before pickup time, they were allowed to grab a book or something simple to put away until my wife arrived to pick them up.\n\nNTA OP, however you may have to think about switching providers as ultimately, the provider does not have to keep you as a client.", ">Sometimes picking them up took like 10 minutes though because I enjoyed talking to their teachers about their day\n\nHeh I used to come and pick up at nap time and just sit on the couch, petting the daycare lady's cat and talking to her. It got to the point the cat would look irritated if I didn't sit down with her. Good daycare people are awesome to hang around with", "So because this ONE time OP needed to get moving quickly for an appointment and couldn\u2019t stay to clean up, she needs to be ridiculed and given a \u201cverbal warning\u201d?   Stop it.  \n\nIf this was a regular occurrence, sure.  That\u2019s rude and unacceptable.  Sometimes as a working parent, however, you literally are just racing from one thing to the next and will occasionally let something slip.

Cleanup should be happening way earlier. This is not how a daycare should be run.", "I work in the field, cleaning up at the end of the day is in their job description.

Every preschool and school that I've worked at, you have to wait at the front desk like a sane person while teachers prepare and send out the student. In preschool that usually entails putting away toys, using the bathroom, and getting dressed. It's a whole routine the entire class does if you're showing up at the designated arrival times. It is a rushed routine that still needs to be done by the student in question, if you're arriving at another time, and does not take twenty minutes. More like five. But no, this lady thinks she can barge into Sasha's home, interrupt a learning session, blatantly flout the rules in front of the entire class, and it just be okay?  \n\n\nOP is absolutely within her rights to take her child at any time. Sasha is also likely within her rights to kick her from the school. And, given that, warning her is a kindness.  \n\n\nPeople keep saying in the comments \"you should be able to pick your child up from daycare whenever you want.\" You can. But, there's still a procedure for pick-up, and that includes putting away your things.  \n\n\nBut nah, OP wants to model to her daughter that personal responsibility is only for when it's convenient to you, and when it's not convenient, you can just dump your responsibilities on others. If she cared about the values of the school and had wanted to be something other than an asshole, she could have offered to help her daughter with her part in the cleanup and demonstrated how helping others benefits you as well."]}
