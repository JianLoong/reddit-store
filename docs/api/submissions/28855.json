The SILs referenced in this story are his brothers' wives. All are early to mid 30s.\r  \n\n\n\r  \nSo my SILs Anna and Brenda were both pregnant at the same time earlier this year, due 1 month apart, with Anna due first. My husband and I live close to Anna and her husband, about a 15 minute walk. Brenda and her husband lived in a different area in the same city.\r  \n\n\n\r  \nAbout 6 mos ago, Brenda and her husband's lease was ending, and they were looking for a new place to rent in a better neighborhood. There were a few houses for rent in our neighborhood within their budget. I sent Brenda links to them and said that living close to us might be nice because I'd be able to help out a lot during her postpartum period. They ended up picking a house that is about a 20 minute drive (on the highway with no traffic) from us because it \"had character\" even though it was further from their jobs. Now, living super near family isn't for everyone lol, I TOTALLY understand that, so no biggie.\r  \n\n\n\r  \nAnna had her baby almost 2 months ago. Since they live only a 15 min walk away, and it's near a park I take my toddler to, I drop off something for them most days. Like, instead of making a 9x13 of lasagna I'll make 2 smaller dishes of it and drop one off on their porch omw to the park. Or on a morning walk, I'll drop off a loaf of pumpkin bread. If my kid is being chill and they are up for visitors, I'll go inside and watch the baby for an hour so they can get a nap in. Sometimes Anna and her baby join us on our walk. This is the sort of support I desperately wished I had during my postpartum days, so I am happy to give it now.\r  \n\r  \nBrenda had her baby about 3 weeks ago. I have driven over 3 times so far and brought food to them each time and done all of their dishes. Two nights ago, however, my husband's brother messaged him about how hurt Brenda was that I am not giving her as much support as I am giving Anna, and how it feels really isolating since they have no friends or family in their new neighborhood. How they are exhausted, never have energy to cook, no one to watch the baby so they can nap, and how Anna posts on her instagram stories the \"gourmet meals\" I drop off for her daily (they aren't gourmet, but I take it as a compliment haha) and how she feels I\u2019m treating them unfairly.\r  \n\n\n\r  \nMy husband pointed out that I urged them to move close to us so I could help, but his brother countered that they only live 5 minutes further away from a \"time POV\" (15 min walk vs 20 min drive - I feel like there's a big difference).\r  \n\n\n\r  \nFWIW, I felt neutral towards both SILs prior to this. And neither helped me whatsoever after I gave birth. I got \"congrats\" texts. It was during the pandemic, but still, no one dropped food off for us or whatever. So it\u2019s not like I was close to either of them prior to this. \r  \n\n\n\r  \nAITA for not \"being willing to travel 5 minutes further\" to help my other SIL as frequently?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1697218989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1774arq/aita_for_helping_one_postpartum_relative_more/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Ask Anna to stop posting photos of your helping her, though. No need to rub it in.)\n\nBut what is equally important: Just because you help one person does not obligate you to help all. That's entitlement. \n\nAnd since brother messaged brother, your spouse should be firmly and clearly standing up for you. What's more, since it's HIS brother, he can go help if he'd like.", "NTA. The five minutes difference is irrelevant. You go to Anna\u2019s house because it convenient. You\u2019re already walking to the park, and you can take your son with you on a nice walk. \n\nGoing to Brenda\u2019s means putting your kid in a car and driving there. That\u2019s completely different.", "It's not a 15 minute walk to Anna's: it's a very brief diversion from a walk to the park that you were going to anyway. That's very different from taking 40 minutes out of your day driving to Brenda's and back. NTA.", "You can tell your husbands brother that you get to decide what schedule fits your family, they come first, if helping them more means less time for your own responsibilities, that\u2019s too bad. I\u2019m super petty so I would text \u201ctell you what, just to be fair, I\u2019ll help you guys the exact amount you helped me when I was postpartum\u201d", "NTA.  You are also caring for your toddler, and Anna's location accommodates that more than Brenda's.  It sounds like whining to me when you should be thanked for dropping off the meals.  You are doing more for either of them than what you received, so I wouldn't worry about it.", "Honestly since these couples are just getting started with parenthood they may not realize how different it is to stop by while on a daily walk to the park vs take a special car trip that will end up being an hour. Brenda and her husband will understand better in a year, but maybe you can make a trip to help once and try explaining gently. Also send hubby over once or twice with extra casseroles - this isn\u2019t all on you. \n\nI think the reason neither SIL helped you is that they didn\u2019t understand what would be appropriate or appreciated because\u2026 no experience. That\u2019s also why Brenda didn\u2019t choose to live nearby. Didn\u2019t realize the difference it could make and that regular cousins outings in the park and impromptu babysitting were being given up. \n\nYou are NTA but I\u2019d see if you can do some easy things to help. You can also invite Brenda and hubby to come visit you and join you for dinner and trips to the park. If it\u2019s not that far, they can do the traveling. And it\u2019ll help them see the situation is about convenience not playing favorites.", "Yeah bit ots not a 20 min car ride is it. Its 40 there and back. 10 minutes struggling to get kiddos in car seats, 10 mins getting food etc. Plus all the baby stuff, bottles bibs, spare clothes nappies etc. Add 10 tk get it out the other end. 15 to get back in the car, thats almost 2 hours now. 15 min walk there and back and add in 30 mins for playing in park and food drop off, an hpur top.

It\u2019s simply convenience.  I can see how Brenda might feel slighted though.  \n\nI say NAH.", "NTA! People are so entitled, it\u2019s crazy.", "NTA, i don't think they planned to have kid according to your help. Probably she feels lonely and emotional because of the hormones.Also might feel less important compare to the other SIL. Don't worry it's very easy to solve. Also it's a bit far from you and I understand the other SIL lives more close. You can communicate and explain yourself gently to your SIL.It might feel like you take care of to other SIL because you go on a walk check it on her cook some extra drop it while taking care of your kid. But you should understand that she has more advantage because she lives closer. You should explain that you also have a kid and it's just about accessibility(I assume you just don't want to drive with your kid or doesn't feel comfortable driving totally normal and cannot leave your kid behind) . Let's talk about BIL.I think he is the one who suppose to take care of the SIL and baby. And suppose to tell his wife, everything is okay nothing personal. I won't comment on your husband. He is another case and i think you can handle him. There is no drama just too much hormonal emotional stuff. You got this, talk with everyone.", "NTA. Especially with a toddler, the difference between a 15-minute walk and a 20-minute drive is huge. You don't owe it to either of them to be doing this, so doing what you can (and not what you can't) is generous enough.", "NTA honestly, I would stop altogether. You\u2019re doing a nice thing and people have turned it into drama and want more than they ever gave you", "NTA. But Anna should stop posting about your help to her, it's stirring the pot.", "NTA.  It's not just the time difference - Anna's house is on your way to the park.  You don't have to go 15 minutes out of your way - it's a path you follow anyways.  So your BIL is wrong on the time difference - it's 20 minutes out of your way to their house (40 minutes total) and 0 minutes out of your way to Anna's house.  \n\nYou could always offer to cook more for them, and BIL can stop by and pick it up on his way home from work.", "There is a huge difference between having to drive 20min and walking 15 that your walking anyway. Your not favoring anyone it\u2019s about location that your tried to get them to move to.", "Nta on the way is vastly different than a 20 minute out of the way drive.", "NTA I hate people that are so entitled and if Brenda had a problem she could have said something to you instead of asking her husband to run interference. What did they expect to happen, did they expect your husband to make you go over there all the time with meals and babysitting offers like you do for Anna? I just hope the holidays aren\u2019t weird for you after being so nice to both sil\u2019s", "NTA and that\u2019s when you stop everything you were doing for Brenda.", "NTA, they are just acting entitled. I hope you stay doing what your doing, you don\u2019t owe anyone anything. If she\u2019s upset - so what- she\u2019ll get over it. your NTA", "NTA do they fail to realize you\u2019re also a mother taking care of a toddler. 15 minute walk and a 20 minute drive two different things. In my opinion, you\u2019ve gone and helped them as much as you can, tbh a lot more than you\u2019ve received from any of them. They are not entitled to your time OP!!", "You don't OWE anyone help but are you sure you aren't punishing them a bit because they didn't want to join your neighborhood like you told them to?", "NTA.\n\nYou're seeing Anna more because she's close and doesn't really require you to go out of your way to get to her house. You're stopping by when you're out walking with your child. \n\nYour BIL's statement about time is a false comparison. He's not taking all the extras that go with getting a toddler into the car when the kid would rather be going to the park. He's not considering gas costs, either. He also seems to be under the impression that you owe his wife equal treatment. Ignore him.", "THIS!!!\n\nMy first thought was getting the stroller ready for a walk is very different than getting everything ready to get in the car.  The travel time might only be a 5 minute difference, but the pre-travel time is different as is the unloading back home time.  Plus gas and mileage on the car versus getting some exercise and enjoying a walk outside?\n\nNTA.", "Not to mention the cost of gas.  A 40 minute drive is more expensive than a 30 minute walk.", "NTA The 20 minute drive from my location to the nearest Walmart comes up as over a 5 hour walk on Google. 15 min walk vs 5 hour walk............. No where near a 5 min distance to travel a little \"further\" to help out the other SIL.... -_-", "I'd say it's more about proximity than punishment. Convenience can sometimes appear as preference.", "Right, and driving over there is just a chore, whereas OP is swinging by Anna's house on her regular outing to the park with her toddler.", "In reality its more like 40 unless op has something to do in that area. Op only making a small detour while out already. But just to drive to do it is more than the five extra minutes each way.", "Probably more than 40 minutes. The 20 minute drive time was cited as \"on the highway *with no traffic*\". Which usually means 25 to 30 minutes at least some of the time most days. Possibly more depending on how bad it can get at rush hour peaks\n\nSo, if OP is only going to go over to drop something off, it could easily be an hour out of her day.\n\nThe difference gets even larger when you consider that on those detours to Anna's house, she only has to do the detour when going one direction to or from the park. Even if it was an extra 5 minutes detouring on the way there, who'ld do the same detour on the way home from the park? I know I'd take the normal (fastest) route. So 5 minutes (or less) out of the way as opposed to maybe an hour.\n\nI will say, this may be only the first wave of discontent OP and her husband will get from Brenda and her husband on this topic.\n\nIf Anna is going to be staying home with her baby for any extended length of time, those detours on the way to the park may turn into meet-ups at the park as the baby gets older. Or play-dates at one house or the other in inclement weather. If Brenda and her husband get wind of that, it could strike a new hue and cry of \"Why isn't she invited too?\", regardless of whether it makes any logistical sense or not.", "It definitely is gonna. I feels like op husband needs to have a talk with his brother when he less overwhelmed with a newborn."]}
