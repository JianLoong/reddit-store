She has her wits about her, gets monthly money for SS, and has been essentially squatting in an apartment for years without paying after the individual for which section 8 was approved moved out. She is historically a thief and addict who steals drugs and money from family. My husband and his sibling feel a sense of responsibility for her. She has known the date of her eviction for months. She failed to make a plan. The date arrived and she started texting my husband that she was homeless and they had to get to her. I called her, she answered, admitted she had no plan of action. \n\nShe lives an hour away in a community where she\u2019s been for decades and knows many people. She said she wanted them there to get old items she will not be able to keep although she has been told repeatedly we do not want anything. I established that she had no plan of action. We do not have space in our homes for her. My in law DID have space for her months ago and told her to move in. She did not, and since then their child moved home so the room is now occupied. \n\nThis to me is called consequences of your own actions and you cannot just dump yourself in someone else\u2019s lap as their burden because you failed to face reality. Despite knowing all this and despite her recently deceased sister warning them that this aunt would do exactly this thing, and that she\u2019s (the aunt) now sending me insulting and passive aggressive texts, I understand I was harsh. Am I the asshole?\n\n\nNew info: \nSince I blocked her, she\u2019s blowing up husband\u2019s phone with emotional manipulation, calling herself his \u201cMother.\u201d His mom died. This is his paternal aunt.

If you let her stay long enough in your home, she\u2019ll become a tenant with legal rights, and you might have to go through a formal eviction process to get her out.
