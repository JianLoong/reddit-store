It sounds like you and your wife are doing a great job! I don't understand why your parents believe they're entitled to two days custody of your newborn. I also think that they were wrong to override you and your wife in regards introducing their dogs to your child at such a young age. To me it seems that they haven't realised that they're not the ones in charge of your child, you and your wife are. The fact that they reneged on visiting your home because they bought a pool chair without asking you and seemingly thought they had the right to tell you your child was going to start swimming right then and there in their pool is mind boggling to me. You did the right thing by informing them that you and your wife are the ones in charge of your child and they need to accept that.

There is nothing you can do or give that will ever be enough for them and the moment they succeed in manipulating you once they will always threaten you with going no or low contact to get their way.
