It hasn't become absolutely necessary since then, so it hasn't happened. I'm a firm believer that not a single person on this earth will love and care for my child the way that I will. They may love her, they may keep her safe and maybe even happy. But babies and toddlers are\nso needy and fragile (babies because they're actually fragile, toddlers because they will kill themselves if you look away for a half of a second), and I'm just not comfortable being away from her for extended periods of time unless it was absolutely necessary in that situation. Don't let them make you feel guilty for being good and protective parents.", "NTA. It sounds like they believe that they know best for your child and will disregard any of your rules. My child is two, and I still won\u2019t leave her with anyone. I don\u2019t blame you one bit for not allowing a 4 month old to have weekend visits", "JFC YOUR BABY IS ONLY FOUR MONTHS NTA, and for the love of your wife shut them tf down. They shouldn't even be asking. Why are they?", "Yep. OP and wife might be more comfortable going out of baby is in his own environment and away from dogs and pool", "She doesn't even live with them.", "It\u2019s actually a great idea to teach babies to swim. There\u2019s survival baby lessons for kids 6 weeks and older. It really does decrease the chances of accidents. However, that needs to be a decision made by the parents", "Right I\u2019m American and my family had a pool when I was growing up so I learned to swim as a wee baby. My parents hired a professional children\u2019s  swim instructor to come to our house and teach me though.", "Yeah, I\u2019m from SA and we were in the pool as soon as we went home. We have photos of all of us cousins in my grandparents pool in these baby-holder floaty things. \n\nThat said, it was with my mothers acceptance and OPs parents are the worst."]}
