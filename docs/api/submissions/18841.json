He started yelling at me to get out so I woke my girlfriend up and told her what was going on.

They got into an argument and I texted her mom and sister to tell them what was going on. They both came home within 20 minutes but her dad had left by then. \n\nThey are both furious.

I can only imagine how much abuse she has had to put up with that she had to move to the guest house to get away from him, and now can't sleep comfortably unless she has a guard nearby. Keep being her guard, and don't give it a second thought that her dad is upset by it. He sounds like a complete asshole.", "NTA- if this was in the contract and the mom and sister are both on your side and are on board with the contract then you did exactly the right thing. Don\u2019t worry about him, he has breached the contract at this point and has no right being there. You are considered a guest and we\u2019re invited.", "NTA - I bet this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened and I\u2019m also willing to bet the dad was upset because someone else stood up to him and called out his shit. I\u2019m adopted, as are my younger sisters, and they were real iffy about personal space and hiding food until they were comfortable at home. This is why not all adoptive parents get gold stars for taking kids in - you have to meet them where they\u2019re at. The dad is a massive asshole with a control complex, I\u2019m proud of you for being there for your girlfriend and protecting her.", "What a mess, I wouldn\u2019t have left either, I\u2019d have stayed to make sure I understood what was going on and make sure she was alright.
