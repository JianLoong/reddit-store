I can only imagine how much abuse she has had to put up with that she had to move to the guest house to get away from him, and now can't sleep comfortably unless she has a guard nearby. Keep being her guard, and don't give it a second thought that her dad is upset by it. He sounds like a complete asshole.", "NTA- if this was in the contract and the mom and sister are both on your side and are on board with the contract then you did exactly the right thing. Don\u2019t worry about him, he has breached the contract at this point and has no right being there. You are considered a guest and we\u2019re invited.", "NTA - I bet this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened and I\u2019m also willing to bet the dad was upset because someone else stood up to him and called out his shit. I\u2019m adopted, as are my younger sisters, and they were real iffy about personal space and hiding food until they were comfortable at home. This is why not all adoptive parents get gold stars for taking kids in - you have to meet them where they\u2019re at. The dad is a massive asshole with a control complex, I\u2019m proud of you for being there for your girlfriend and protecting her.", "What a mess, I wouldn\u2019t have left either, I\u2019d have stayed to make sure I understood what was going on and make sure she was alright.

Don't let your gf be alone with him!!!!!", "\ud83d\ude21", "Her sister said she\u2019s had trouble sleeping alone since before she moved in here but yeah her dad is pretty bad. After this happened, she doesn\u2019t like to be alone at all so I try to be with her as much as I can.", "real", "NTA and as much as I hate to say it now you probably know Why your girlfriend has ptsd, feels vulnerable and trouble sleeping \u2026 her \u2018dad\u2019.", "NTA\n\nPlease keep making your girlfriend feel safe when she sleeps. You're a good boyfriend for that.", "From this story, I feel like maybe the *reason* she doesn\u2019t feel safe sleeping alone is because this isn\u2019t the first time this guy has \u201ccome into her room while she was sleeping\u201d.\n\nThank you for standing guard and refusing to abandon her.", "NTA\n\nHer dad is a piece of work.", "Godzilla", "This is why she needs someone there when she sleeps. He is an AH. If you had not been there he would have scared her.", "NTA. And it's pretty telling that 20 min after texting BOTH mom AND sister races up mad as hell. Why is he going in there while she sleeps? Read the room and believe it, you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nOP I have PTSD and my dad is an awful piece of shit, your girlfriend was very lucky to have you. You unquestionably did the right thing and you should be damn proud of yourself.", "NTA. Putting aside any emotions or family history, either your girlfriend or her sister (not clear which) has a contract that states they're allowed guests, and you are a guest. Also, if their dad is their landlord, then depending where you are he may be breaking the terms of the contract by entering the property without notice as the landlord.", "NTA", "NTA why did he want to be alone with her so bad?? Sounds like he wanted to do something bad to her but he couldn\u2019t since you were there. No wonder why she doesn\u2019t want to sleep alone.", "Might be nice to have some more backstory on the adoption.  Dad seems out of character to adopt a random stray who's about to age out of the system anyway, not without some nefarious purpose that I refuse to speculate about unless you have some more meaningful insight into that.", "NTA but if dad has the keys to the guesthouse then they really need to change the locks. I can see where your girlfriend gets her anxiety from. Both mom and sister don't want him in the guesthouse, that means he doesn't belong in the guesthouse.", "I thought this too!! Why is she afraid of sleeping alone? Maybe for this reason\u2026", "Wait! I'm confused.  She was adopted by this family... from where? Did these people  \" adopt\" her from a different country? Because to me it sounds like these people didn't \" adopt\" in order to have another daughter,  they did so in order to have staff for their home.  The oldest \" sister\" lives in the guest house in exchange for housework and child care,  now the GF is living in there and has a contract?!?! What kind is \"family\" needs a contract for their DAUGHTER? it honestly sounds like these RICH people are \" adopting\" young ladies to have servants,  and the \" Dad\" has a history of being handsy with them,  why else would she not feel comfortable, and have to have a rule written into her CONTRACT  that says her \n\" dad\" can't be in her room?", "That dude is sketchy as hell. NTA. You did the right thing. Your gf is 18 and staying in her sister's house. I know it is on his property but it's rented to the sister. The mom and sister are correct.", "NTA, and I sincerely hope that someone is staying with her 24/7 because it sounds like he expected her to be alone and to get away with it, so how many times has he done it in the past and no one has known? And what did he plan to actually do if he\u2019d gone in and no one was there? Terrifying. At the very, very least you guys need some cameras up and she needs a way to lock the doors from inside that will absolutely prevent anyone else from getting in.", "INFO\nWhy do the opinions of your girlfriend, her sister, and her mom matter less to you than the opinion of her dad?  The father who is the same person you were present to guard her from while she slept and who is so problematic that he isn't allowed into your girlfriend & sister's home?", "I\u2019ve asked her sister and she said she was like this in other foster homes but this guy isn\u2019t making it any better.", "Adopted from foster care. Gf doesn\u2019t have a contract. Her sister is basically a live in nanny/maid so she has a contract with work/living situation rules. I guess it says no one is allowed to go in there without her permission and guests are allowed.", "IKR? I understand the older sister living in the guest house but in exchange of housework is a bit strange. Are you rich or not? And having a contract? Who gives a daughter a contract for the guesthouse? And said contract barrs her father from going to her room? This whole situation is very weird and that's not even getting into the father visiting his daughter and getting so mad that OP was there. \n\nVery sketchy.", "Her sister and I make sure one of us is with her 24/7. We didn\u2019t change the locks yet but I put in a deadbolt and we put a lock on my girlfriends room.", "But remember she was a foster kid adopted at 16. Who knows what she went through those 16 years and then add captain asshole on top of that.", "The sister has a contract and it doesn\u2019t allow the family to enter the guesthouse without her permission", "Please get cameras too, so that you know what happened IF something happens. His intentions couldn\u2019t have been good. There was NO reason for him to do what he did unless he had ill intent.", "I understand that, I still think it's weird to have a contract in the first place. Like, sister knew her father would barge in all the time without permission.", "I think it\u2019s more about work (she\u2019s basically a live in nanny) but it includes stuff about the guesthouse."]}
