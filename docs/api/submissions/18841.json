I can only imagine how much abuse she has had to put up with that she had to move to the guest house to get away from him, and now can't sleep comfortably unless she has a guard nearby. Keep being her guard, and don't give it a second thought that her dad is upset by it. He sounds like a complete asshole.", "NTA- if this was in the contract and the mom and sister are both on your side and are on board with the contract then you did exactly the right thing.

You are considered a guest and we\u2019re invited.", "NTA - I bet this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened and I\u2019m also willing to bet the dad was upset because someone else stood up to him and called out his shit.

This is why not all adoptive parents get gold stars for taking kids in - you have to meet them where they\u2019re at.

Don't let your gf be alone with him!!!!!", "\ud83d\ude21", "Her sister said she\u2019s had trouble sleeping alone since before she moved in here but yeah her dad is pretty bad. After this happened, she doesn\u2019t like to be alone at all so I try to be with her as much as I can.", "real", "NTA and as much as I hate to say it now you probably know Why your girlfriend has ptsd, feels vulnerable and trouble sleeping \u2026 her \u2018dad\u2019.", "NTA\n\nPlease keep making your girlfriend feel safe when she sleeps. You're a good boyfriend for that.", "From this story, I feel like maybe *the reason* she doesn\u2019t feel safe sleeping alone is because this isn\u2019t the first time this guy has \u201ccome into her room while she was sleeping\u201d.\n\nThank you for standing guard and refusing to abandon her.", "NTA\n\nHer dad is a piece of work.", "Godzilla", "This is why she needs someone there when she sleeps. He is an AH. If you had not been there he would have scared her.", "NTA. And it's pretty telling that 20 min after texting BOTH mom AND sister races up mad as hell. Why is he going in there while she sleeps? Read the room and believe it, you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nOP I have PTSD and my dad is an awful piece of shit, your girlfriend was very lucky to have you. You unquestionably did the right thing and you should be damn proud of yourself.", "NTA. Putting aside any emotions or family history, either your girlfriend or her sister (not clear which) has a contract that states they're allowed guests, and you are a guest. Also, if their dad is their landlord, then depending where you are he may be breaking the terms of the contract by entering the property without notice as the landlord.", "NTA", "NTA why did he want to be alone with her so bad?? Sounds like he wanted to do something bad to her but he couldn\u2019t since you were there. No wonder why she doesn\u2019t want to sleep alone.", "Might be nice to have some more backstory on the adoption.  Dad seems out of character to adopt a random stray who's about to age out of the system anyway, not without some nefarious purpose that I refuse to speculate about unless you have some more meaningful insight into that.", "NTA but if dad has the keys to the guesthouse then they really need to change the locks. I can see where your girlfriend gets her anxiety from. Both mom and sister don't want him in the guesthouse, that means he doesn't belong in the guesthouse.", "I thought this too!! Why is she afraid of sleeping alone? Maybe for this reason\u2026", "Wait! I'm confused.  She was adopted by this family... from where? Did these people  \" adopt\" her from a different country? Because to me it sounds like these people didn't \" adopt\" in order to have another daughter,  they did so in order to have staff for their home.  The oldest \" sister\" lives in the guest house in exchange for housework and child care,  now the GF is living in there and has a contract?!?! What kind is \"family\" needs a contract for their DAUGHTER? it honestly sounds like these RICH people are \" adopting\" young ladies to have servants,  and the \" Dad\" has a history of being handsy with them,  why else would she not feel comfortable, and have to have a rule written into her CONTRACT  that says her \n\" dad\" can't be in her room?", "That dude is sketchy as hell. NTA. You did the right thing. Your gf is 18 and staying in her sister's house. I know it is on his property but it's rented to the sister. The mom and sister are correct.", "NTA, and I sincerely hope that someone is staying with her 24/7 because it sounds like he expected her to be alone and to get away with it, so how many times has he done it in the past and no one has known? And what did he plan to actually do if he\u2019d gone in and no one was there? Terrifying. At the very, very least you guys need some cameras up and she needs a way to lock the doors from inside that will absolutely prevent anyone else from getting in.", "INFO\nWhy do the opinions of your girlfriend, her sister, and her mom matter less to you than the opinion of her dad?  The father who is the same person you were present to guard her from while she slept and who is so problematic that he isn't allowed into your girlfriend & sister's home?", "I\u2019ve asked her sister and she said she was like this in other foster homes but this guy isn\u2019t making it any better.", "Adopted from foster care. Gf doesn\u2019t have a contract. Her sister is basically a live in nanny/maid so she has a contract with work/living situation rules. I guess it says no one is allowed to go in there without her permission and guests are allowed.", "IKR? I understand the older sister living in the guest house but in exchange of housework is a bit strange. Are you rich or not? And having a contract? Who gives a daughter a contract for the guesthouse? And said contract barrs her father from going to her room? This whole situation is very weird and that's not even getting into the father visiting his daughter and getting so mad that OP was there. \n\nVery sketchy.", "Her sister and I make sure one of us is with her 24/7. We didn\u2019t change the locks yet but I put in a deadbolt and we put a lock on my girlfriends room.", "But remember she was a foster kid adopted at 16. Who knows what she went through those 16 years and then add captain asshole on top of that.", "The sister has a contract and it doesn\u2019t allow the family to enter the guesthouse without her permission", "Please get cameras too, so that you know what happened IF something happens. His intentions couldn\u2019t have been good. There was NO reason for him to do what he did unless he had ill intent.", "I understand that, I still think it's weird to have a contract in the first place. Like, sister knew her father would barge in all the time without permission.", "I think it\u2019s more about work (she\u2019s basically a live in nanny) but it includes stuff about the guesthouse.", "Nta. Protect your gf.", "My only real question here is why he wanted to be alone with her and he wasn't even allowed in her space?\n\nI mean... she doesn't want to be/sleep alone, there is a contract that bars him from entering without permission, women in the family are grateful you stayed... .\n\nThose are some very disturbing warning signs... .", "I think it was less about him wanting to be alone with her and more about seeing my car and knowing that we were home alone and wanting to go on a power trip. Contract doesn\u2019t allow anyone in the family from entering without permission and the yelling really triggered her ptsd so leaving her alone wouldn\u2019t have been a good idea at all.", "Who is this contract with and why? I don\u2019t understand this at all.", "It\u2019s with my girlfriends parents. It\u2019s mostly work stuff (she\u2019s basically a live in nanny) but it has some rules/protections about her housing.", "I was wondering about that too. Also what country they are living in. \n\nDo they not have locks on the door that only the gf and sister have a key to? Why was the dad or anyone able to just wall in? \n\nWe don't know enough, so to be fair,  maybe dad is worried that his daughter is deaf and they anyone could take advantage especially if sleeping. But OP is the boyfriend and knows he the boyfriend so behavior over the top unless he's worried she'll get pregnant...\n\nHe said his girlfriend's adoptive dad is rich. Then why have not both his gf and her older sister gone to college? Why did they give sister work as a nanny and housekeeper and what appears an unpaid job (no cash)? \n\nLive-in nannies get their own bedroom and bathroom and all meals that are the same as the kids. Also depending on the family their own kitchen and living room.  What they all get is cash, they get paid for taking care of the kids - decent pay too.  \n\nDepending on what country they're in,  his gf could do college online.  They have entire programs online so being deaf went be a challenge. Then get remote work which she could possibly look into now.\n\nIts concerning that there is a contract. Never heard of having a contract with your kids. \n\nAre the children living in the dad's house his biological children? \n\nIs the dad married? Where's the wife in all of this? How many younger kids are there? What happens to the gf and sister when younger kids are adults? \n\nRegardless,  OP is NTA. He did as his gf asked so that she can feel safe and relaxed enough to sleep. \n\nWonder if she could get a service dog to aid her - be her ears. Maybe then she would feel less vulnerable and be more independent.\n\nEdit - spelling / word use", "We live in the US. They do have locks on the guest house but her parents have a key. Gf is gonna go to college. Sister has an associates and gf will start college in the fall. I\u2019m pretty sure sister gets paid but I don\u2019t know how much. All I know is when my gf moved in, they offered her sister the nanny job so she could stay close to my gf. \nMy gf doesn\u2019t have a contract. Her sister has one for work that includes rules and protections with her housing. Dad is married but that\u2019s a whole other post. They have 4 more kids, some biological some adopted. I don\u2019t know what will happen when they\u2019re adults but that\u2019s at least 10 years away (oldest is 8).", "I think that what they were getting at is why does the person causing the PTSD episode think that it's okay for them to be left alone with their victim. The only extra safety she would feel is knowing where the aggressor is at. If he knew how to handle her properly, he would realized that he fucked up right as soon as he started freaking out and then saw his daughter was there and now triggered then said sorry and left. He's part of her PTSD triggers and she needs some distance from this temper tantrum boy."]}
