I don't know how we got onto the topic, but someone started asking who all the guys in the group would save in a house fire.\n\nWhen it got to my turn, my wife asked me who I would save: her or my mother (F63). I said I didn't feel comfortable answering, and she and the others continued to press me. I then said if I could sacrifice myself to save both I would take that option, they said that was a cop-out, and my wife insisted that I answer, and only pick one person.\n\nI then jokingly asked my wife why and if it was her starting this hypothetical fire. She said yes, and then I said, in that case, it's easy: I'm picking my mom. Everyone was surprised, and my wife got annoyed, saying that I needed to put her first. I told her that in this scenario, it was her decision to start the fire and that my mother had nothing to do with it, so why should she suffer?\n\nAfter our friends left, my wife randomly asked me again, and I said I would pick my mother. She became upset and said I was being insensitive. She pointed out how I was the only guy who didn't pick their SO and that I wasn't giving her unconditional love. I said the whole thing was stupid and that she's looking too much into it a childish game. AITA?\n\nEDIT ADDITIONAL CONTEXT - My wife and my mother are friendly towards one another whenever they do meet and interact. We've been married for nearly a year now and when we got married, my mother bought my wife a $5000 gold set. So yeah I'd say they are decently close", "created_utc": 1686052300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142dj9z/aita_for_picking_my_mother_over_my_wife/", "score": 969, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I said I didn't feel comfortable answering, and she and the others continued to press me. I then said if I could sacrifice myself to save both I would take that option, they said that was a cop-out, and my wife insisted that I answer, and only pick one person.\n\nI then jokingly asked my wife why and if it was her starting this hypothetical fire. She said yes, and then I said, in that case, it's easy: I'm picking my mom. Everyone was surprised, and my wife got annoyed, saying that I needed to put her first. I told her that in this scenario, it was her decision to start the fire and that my mother had nothing to do with it, so why should she suffer?\n\nAfter our friends left, my wife randomly asked me again, and I said I would pick my mother. She became upset and said I was being insensitive. She pointed out how I was the only guy who didn't pick their SO and that I wasn't giving her unconditional love. I said the whole thing was stupid and that she's looking too much into it a childish game. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She engaged in manipulation and her demand that he answer \"her\"  or its not \"unconditional love\" (which isn't real) is a red flag and a half.", "Bullshit this was a fuking test not a joke, and it was the wife that made it a big deal and yanked the marriage when she ignored OP refusal and pressured him to answer", "What's the joke?", "Where was the joke? Explain it, it's funnier that way \ud83d\ude44", "Take another read at the text.\n\nOP asked the wife if she starts the fire and she says yes. OP therefore picks the person who didn't start the fire and thus risk his life cause of said fire.\n\nJumping straight to divorce for that is too extreme, mate", "Strongly disagree. This stupid hypothetical should have been shut down in the exact way it was to deter this type of situation from rearing its head in the future.", "Always?", "You coulda just made your point without saying all women are like that lmao", "OP replies \"No, it's all the cake you eat that makes it look big\"..", "Yes! It's the easiest possible answer in the world.  No one, probably not even his own mother, would be upset if he said \"my wife.\"\n\nBut he had to drag it out, say \"I'm uncomfortable answering\" which really means \"I'd pick my mother over my wife.\"  So now his wife feels awful, and presses him, because...  well he just shot her down when she just wanted a quick easy bit of reassurance.\n\nOP is a jerk.  And a moron.", "I literally ask my husband weird questions like that all the time. \u201cIf I laughed like this (crazy manic laugh) would you still love me?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d", "The question had been up less than an hour. It's now top comment.", "It's a stupid easy question.  Why not say \"my wife?\"  The only reason he'd be uncomfortable is if his answer was \"my mother\" which is pretty odd, and it makes sense that his wife would press him after that.", "Exactly, and answering like she was pressuring him to would only encourage more of this idiocy. This is not a mature way to seek assurance of his love.", "Because it's a game. Everyone who hears that question in that situation knows that. You immediately say \"you of course\" and move on. It only became a real question because of his actions. There would be no pressure and it wouldn't be turned into an ordeal. He created this problem. Now his wife is thinking, is it literally this hard for you to just play along on a couples night. Is it so hard to just say your wife. Everyone else at the party got it. He's either too pedantic or he doesn't even like his wife enough pretend for the game.", "I knew it couldn't be too long. There is tension between your wife and mother, huh?", "I think we have a winner!", "Thank you!!! Like why couldn\u2019t I finde this at the top? Like what does the wife expect? Play stupid games, win dumb prizes!", "Same thoughts", "63 is not elderly", "Good one I would save my dog as well \ud83e\udd23", "\u201cEasy. Neither. I would save my Pok\u00e9mon card collection.\u201d", "So? They're a grown ass adult who can put their own foot down.", "And its still a dumb conversation.", "No... he didn't. He said his mother", "Hi, are you married? Just wondering.\nEdit: I\u2019m not interested", "Why on earth would a 28yo man be so uncomfortable about a jokey question if he wasn't still mummy's lite boy at heart? The wife pressed because she suspected he would say Mummy, but hoped he'd actually care fir his wife.", "Then you should never get married. When you marry someone they become your family. You are not mature enough to understand that.", "At that very moment yes. But its plausible that his wife could bring the conversation up later around his mom and smugly say, \"he picked me\". Words have a way of coming around to bite you in the ass later.", "If it was just an accident, then I\u2019m going with so but he did ask if she \u201cintentionally started the fire\u201d in which she replied yes.", "Nah wife needs to check her expectations.", "I'm with OP.\nHe is an honest and logical guy- WITH a sense of hunour.\nGF better not be sulking for too lomg or someone else will snatch him up.", "I had the same thought. Mom has a few years left, wife in theory could have half a century. OP should have picked her for that reason alone. But then all the other people picked their wives too. OP missed an easy lay up.", "Because he\u2019s a dude and a wife had her poor feelings hurt on AITA. You must be new here :P", "I know you\u2019re generalising but now I\u2019m imagining carrying Ben Shapiro out of a house-fire fireman-style while David Attenborough calls out for help behind me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", ">All I said was that I'm sorry that I value my mother's wellbeing more than your ability to start house fires\n\nESH\n\nIn front of her friends? You really couldn't just pick your wife? She's a jerk for putting you on the spot like that and pressing on, but you responded with something even more incendiary.", "More importantly why do people ask these daft questions which they don't want the answer to.", "Yep.\n\nIt's the same thing as 'Would you love me if I was a worm?'", "It\u2019s a hypothetical question. You really couldn\u2019t just say your wife and move on? You\u2019re not actually saving anyone, buddy.", "Lmfao you kinda set yourself on fire to keep mommy warm and she wasn\u2019t even in the room. Is this a metaphor for how you act normally? Wondering why a room full of people had to try and demonstrate for you that you should put your spouse first.", "sir this is weird", "You're not ready to be a husband and definitely not a father. It was a stupid game to play, but a man should of course choose his wife over his mother. It would be a horrible situation if it happened but your wife is your present and your future, your world, she'll create your family with you. We're supposed to outlive our parents. It doesn't mean we want our parents to die young or die at all or this would be easy. But yeah, the no brainer is you choose your wife over your mom. Basically always. Unless you don't see your wife as your forever.", "So why get married at all if you can\u2019t put your spouse first? I don\u2019t know about your marriage vows, but mine included forsaking all others. It wasn\u2019t forsake all others except my mom.", "Just divorce and live with your mommy", "Maybe? Doesn't sound like OP's wife initiated the game, but she has the right to be off put if everyone else in the group says their spouse and OP makes a spectacle of it and then says his mother. This is a pretty simple example of how (not) to navigate social situations. Just play along and move on.", "What if she set the fire by accident? Why are you assuming she\u2019s an arsonist?", "Only an idiot and an asshole wouldn\u2019t have just given the correct answer in the first place. This wasn\u2019t a hard question.", "It could be an accidental fire when cooking he didn't ask \"did you commit arson to kill us?\" If it's an accidental fire then he's saying you get to die for a mistake. Which is probably why she's so upset besides the obvious.", "Nobody ever said the fire was started on purpose.", "...28 years...?....who's still being raised by their mommy when they're 28 years old?", "Look OP had no intention of picking his wife - When she asked the question, he should not have hesitated and asked such a ridiculous question that gave him the excuse to choose his mother over his wife.\n\nQuestion: Wife/Mother\n\nAnswer: Wife\n\nInstead, he hummed & hawwed and gave her a stupid example to get out of choosing her.", "The question why get married if you aren\u2019t willing to put your spouse above all others. I\u2019m pretty sure that line is in the traditional wedding vows anyway.", "OP is pretty thick. \n\nWhich matters more, winning or being happy? \n\nBut what do I know? The big difference between divorce and marriage is whether spouses are given appropriate priority and nobody values marriage appropriately anymore or even treats marriages like marriages. \n\nBut I guess that's why my parents never divorced, they weren't dumb enough to not make each other #1. That mentality brought je stability and meant they still have a happy marriage. Everyone else didn't make their spouses spouse-level priority in life and it meant instability, divorce, and broken homes for their children. \n\nAnyone who actually understands what a marriage is and doesn't treat their partner like disposable garbage would blame OP. He fucked up big time.", "And everyone only gets ine life. If you'd sacrifice your spouse's life then you should just stay with your parents. Nobody marries to be killed by their partner, even hypothetically, that's not what a marriage is. \n\nSomething I have noticed over time is that partners that stay married snd don't divorce and remarry always put each other first. It's always the ones who think spouses don't come first that can't stay married, they don't give their partner spouse-level priority and love in life. \n\nPeople who have their priorities and hearts straight don't end up going through multiple divorces and marriages. A marriage is a chosen contract, and it is one where you are each other's priority, if you can't be that then you simply aren't marriage material.", "She expected unconditional love, of course! Even if she's a killer, she's still his wife \n\n/s", "Lol OP chose to frame the question in a way that would justify his choice. *You* reread. He could have asked a number of qualifying questions to get to saving his wife but he found a way to justify his truth. Saving mommy.\n\nI guarantee it: nobody answering NTA is in a happy marriage. Not a single one.", "Thanks for sharing. It\u2019s a stupid hypothetical but it mattered to her and had he placated her he wouldn\u2019t be here right now. I like to live on easy mode but do you. I cave to simple requests that are in my power bc it\u2019s no skin off my back and it avoids issuesz", "I see insanity wolf has entered the conversation.", "It really doesn't. Why would you ignore your spouses discomfort then expect them to answer in your favor? It's a stupid question, I agree. So according to that she shouldn't have asked it in the first place. She literally said she started the house fire so why would you save the person who started the fire in the first place??", "Ah yes, a question about what you'd do if you had to break into a burning building to save a loved one knowing that the choice you make will result in the death of another loved one.\n\nThat's a completely comfortable question, yep", "And don't y'all ever think of the fact that maybe the reason he'd be uncomfortable is because he's being put on the spot to choose between his wife and his mother, which COULD end in a bad relationship between at one of them if he didn't choose the mother??", "Because most people don't like being made to choose which of the two people they love they would let die in a fire? It's a weird, petty and emotionally manipulative question? If a partner asked me that I'd also say my mom because she never asks me dumb shit like that.", "EXACTLY. The entire situation is stupid, but he's not an asshole for it. It's a stupid ass question either way.", "It became a real question because she treated him like it was. He said he wasn't comfy answering and she literally pressured him to answer and ignored his discomfort. He said he would sacrifice himself to save the two, she didn't like that answer either. He said his mom, all of a sudden he's insensitive when he gave her two other answers that she didn't agree with. He DID say his wife, but not in the way y'all wanted him to.", ">He created this problem\n\nThis is some next level victim blaming.", "They honestly have gotten along pretty well so far", "English is not my first language. From what age on do you call people eldery?", "You\u2019re right, I\u2019d never marry someone who gets this upset about a completely hypothetical situation. \n\nOP\u2019s wife asked a deeply immature question CLEARLY intended to validate her feelings, and got insecure when he was put on the spot and answered \u201cwrong\u201d. Anyone who makes up hypothetical scenarios because they can\u2019t trust their partner\u2019s love already given is incredibly immature.", "Oh right dur, yea she tried to kill his mom  burn woman!", "And he hesitated the entire time, only giving an answer once clarifying she started it. That he didn't have an answer beforehand means he didn't plan to save her regardless lol. Cheap cop out.", "If i shot your mom and myself, who would you save hmmmmmmmmmmmmm????", "Hypothetical daughter would come unequivocal first in the scenario they cooked up. I of course value relationship with my wife but my mom is mom", "My mom wanted us to add that caveat to our vows, but I said no way.", "Because in the scenario, she was!", "don't be daft yk wtf I mean", "Or maybe you and his wife and friends need to grow up and not get upset over stupid hypotheticals that will never happen. If you ask a question like this you're already an idiot, but getting upset about it makes you an even bigger idiot.", "Okay\n\nBut you do realize this was a FAKE SCENARIO", "I'll be honest, my first thought is that there is something there between them. A little comment here and there that is bothering your wife. Even if it IS innocent enough, it's rubbing her the wrong way. There really would be no other reason this would upset her so badly.", "Oh you poor innocent man. Women hate each other in ways that seem like they love each other", "Anything over 60 in my part of the UK! Basically when you start paying cheaper prices for things! Got an OAP ticket? You're elderly!", "Like 80s I would", "63 is definitely elderly.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying!\ud83d\ude02! She starts a fire in purpose then expects him to choose between the woman who could\u2019ve killed all of them and the woman who birthed him? I\u2019m sorry, no.\ud83d\ude02", "Why would he? If he doesn't save her he saves on the cost of a divorce. Their marriage is already circling the drain if she is looking for validation a these sorts of games. Whether it is something he did or her own insecurities she will always be looking for all the ways in which he is failing as a husband.", "I mean I'm going ESH because don't ask questions you don't want the answer to but I'm slightly concerned that even in the comments here you're picking your mom over your wife.\n\nI know with 100% certainty my husband would pick me over his mom. I don't need to ask. I also know it's his daughter over me which is also completely correct IMO.\n\nIf I ranked below his mother, the relationship is over. I wouldn't need to ask. That's a dead marriage.\n\nSo I have to ask. Would you really pick your mother over your wife?", "What first scenario? What hypothetical daughter? You gotta grow up kid.", "Did you take sacred vows to your mom when you married her? Through sickness and health, good times and bad?", "Has there been any history of you siding with your mom over your wife in the past?", "The original question didn\u2019t include such a stipulation. OP purposely manipulated it so that he could justify picking his mom. I guarantee this is not the first time this has been an issue. The wife specifically asked between her and his mom because he always puts his mom first.", "Obviously, it's a fake scenario. \n\nBut that doesn't devalue the value of their hypothetical actions. But now the wife knows her fate if that fake scenario becaje real, that's what matters, if OP values his wife."]}
