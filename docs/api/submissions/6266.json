I was overjoyed and couldn\u2019t wait to meet my granddaughter. This isn\u2019t my first grandchild but it is the one I have a chance to know as a newborn. \n\nJames and Maya live seven hours away by car and I don\u2019t have lots of time to visit them because I\u2019m raising my youngest daughter still. I am recently retired so I have more time on my hands but a trip up there would require extra planning. James doesn\u2019t visit home as he says being around his family is draining, so we have only met Maya once when we visited once. \n\nAfter Lily was born I called James and asked when he wanted me to come. He said he wasn\u2019t sure so I decided that December 8th-17th would be a good time and I stayed. It was okay. I didn\u2019t get to spend a lot of time with Lily as she was with Maya all the time and Maya was in their room. The few times I tried to talk to Maya she seemed disinterested. After I left James texted my husband and said he\u2019d love for him to meet Lily. We decided to plan a trip there for January 17th-23rd. \n\nWhen James and Maya found out (we called) Maya was clearly upset. This made James upset. Now they are saying we can\u2019t come to visit because we did not ask them if that was a good time. They are worried Lily might get sick and that I am not respecting their space. I feel like this is unfair as I have tried to be helpful and involved with Lilys birth and supportive to Maya yet they reject me. James told me Maya is not too fond of me showing up with short notice and feels that i\u2019m disrespectful to their space and time with Lily. I feel like this is disrespectful to me and my time work my granddaughter. My other grandchildren I met when they were toddlers so I don\u2019t feel such a connection to them. Plus they live closer. \n\nMy husband says to let it go and cancel the trip but I don\u2019t want to plus I spent money on this. I want to spend time with Lily and I  fear I won\u2019t be able to. Am I the asshole for not canceling the trip? And Am I an asshole for planning it without their consent? I just want to be closer to family.", "created_utc": 1672638789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1014u9h/aita_for_planning_visits_to_see_my_granddaughter/", "score": 255, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s disrespectful, YTA", "YTA your eagerness is going to sour this relationship entirely. Visits like this are NOT supposed to be decided on by he guests and the hosts just \u201cdeal\u201d with it. \n\nApologize, send supportive supplies/materials that they request and offer gentle reminders for when a better date for THEM would be for you to visit. it may not be what what you\u2019d like but it\u2019s their life and their baby. There\u2019s probably other stuff that you\u2019re not telling us about your relationship.", "Of course YTA you don't plan a visit to visit your baby granddaughter without asking the parents.", "You chose dates. You made reservations,  THEN you called to inform brand new parents you'd be there in a few weeks.  All this knowing your son already says time with family is draining.....\n\nSorry, YTA.", "Of course YTA. You don\u2019t decide when to visit someone, especially new parents, without their consent.", "YTA. They said no. End of story.   \nWho on earth invites themselves to someone else\u2019s house, especially when the hosts have just had a baby? That\u2019s just rude.", "Lady. I have read all your comments. You are not listening. You plan to have a locksmith change the locks on their house so that you can forcibly get in. You have prepaid for public events such as wine tastings (impossible to attend with a mask) and are questioning their pediatrician. You believe you have claim to a kid WHO IS NOT YOUR OWN. You are demonstrably crazy and unhinged.\n\nIt all comes down to this: You do not control these adults. You will never have the relationship you want with Lily if you are even a sliver like this in person. YTA, a massive one, who will never know their grandchild with this attitude and insanity. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if you are served with a no contact order or end up jailed for trespassing.", "YTA. Your granddaughter is not your daughter and you do not have any rights, legal or otherwise, that supersede parental rights.\n\nInstead, spend your time building a connection to the other grandchildren that you seem to dismiss as lost causes as far as being emotionally close to them goes because you only met them as toddlers.\n\nYou better respect James and Maya, or else you will have to wait until Lily is a toddler or even older to see her again", "Yes, YTA.  You should NEVER plan a trip without consulting those you intend to visit.  Times that are good for you may NOT be good for them.  \n\nI understand you are excited and want to spend time with your granddaughter, but it's not your right to just draw up your own plans and timeline.  If anything, that will make the parents less likely to work with you in trying to accomodate you.\n\nBottom line, she is their baby.  They are her parents, and life can be exhausting with a young infant.  Please be respectful and ask when it might be best for you to visit, instead of telling them when to expect your arrival.  I can't blame them....I'd be pretty upset with you, too.", "YTA \nYour post is a bit confusing but seriously, don't badger them about this or they are likely to go NC in future. Tbh, i feel there is a lot you aren't saying because none of kids aren't too happy about you being around it seems.", "YTA, I didn\u2019t want help as a new mom and just wanted time to bond as a new family. Next time ask before booking.", "YTA. This sort of behavior is why, as you mentioned in another comment, you have a \"rocky relationship\" and your \"communication is off.\" You did not even attempt to communicate, you just decided that you got to dictate the scheduling for brand new parents who are likely also working. That is terrible behavior. Take your trip, bit don't expect to see them or the baby. This is not the way to build a relationship.", "YTA.  You don't have a god-given right to visit your granddaughter.  You need her parents' permission.  If you don't have it, cancel the trip, apologize for assuming, and ask when they think would be a better time.  Offer to come babysit when they'd like a weekend to themselves sometime. They'll take you up on that eventually.", "YTA-You are not entitled to a relationship with your grandchild. You are only entitled to what her parents are willing to allow. If you want a relationship with grandchild you start by respecting her parents.", "YTA.

You really have no idea how suffocating and invasive you are, do you? Get this through to yourself:\n\nYou have no god given right to that baby. You are extended family, not her parent. You bend to the times, places and wants of the parents or you DO NOT SEE HER. End of story.\n\nYour son and Maya sound like introverts (an assumption on my part but still) PLUS they are parents to a newborn. Understand that even an introvert with no responsibility or work or other social commitments is NOT going to want you dropping in on them whenever you damn well please, LET ALONE brand new parents. Leave them the hell alone and go and get that therapy they wanted you to get - and no, they didn\u2019t mean family therapy with them involved, they clearly meant you, alone, go for damn therapy, because you clearly need it.", "YTA\n\nMaybe the parents are bit rude to you but you have to understand how difficult is to manage a newborn and attending you at the same time. Maybe your intentions were not wrong but planning a trip without parents consent is wrong.\n\nAlso I am feeling that you are leaving out something and why your daughter in law is not comfortable around you.", "YTA\n\nYou have to coordinate these things. You can't just decide what days work for you and announce them.\n\nI feel like that's a lot of missing context here. You only met your other grandchildren as toddlers? Maya was acting distant? There's more going on here about your relationships with your children.", "YTA of AHs.  You already showed up unannounced once, and that's one time too many.  Did you ever stop to think that your smothering is why your other kids kept their children away from you?", "\"don\u2019t have lots of time to visit them because I\u2019m raising my youngest daughter still. I am recently retired so I have more time on my hands\"\n\n??", "YTA, if they want your help, they'll ask for your help. If they want you to spend time with Lily, then I'm sure they know you want to and will tell you when a good time is. This is their child, their home, and their boundaries they're setting up. Parents take priority,  and honestly, the more you push, the less likely they are going to willingly involve you in their lives. I think you should take a trip to JustNoMIL and see how people feel about mother in laws that act the way you act.", "Dude. You sound so outrageously entitled, I almost think you might be fake. \n\nIF everything you\u2019re saying is truly how you feel and how you intend to act/co tongue to behave, absolutely YTA. \n\nYou sound like my narc aunt who victimizes herself CONSTANTLY, stirs drama when she\u2019s bored, and feels entitled to her grown children\u2019s lives and info and will badger and browbeat until she gets it. \n\nSTOP. IT. \nStop thinking you\u2019re right. \nStop thinking you\u2019re IN the right. \nStop trying to stand on \u201cyour rights\u201d. \n\nYou won\u2019t have anything left if you continue to behave like this, and to be honest, I\u2019d applaud your grown kids for laying down the law and protecting THEIR families from you.", "YTA. Literally everyone here is telling you what is wrong, but you just keep digging in your heels.\n\nIf you are not listening to your son and DIL, you are not respecting them. Planning week long visits when they have a newborn is not okay. \n\nYour wants do not matter here. They are her parents. They don't need you checking up on her development. Offer your assistance, and then let them come to you. STOP FORCING YOURSELF ON THEM. It does not matter what you think of the status of your relationship--everything about their responses says that they do not want you in their space.\n\nIf you want this relationship to ever improve--with all 3 of them--you HAVE to back off. That is the only way. The more you push yourself on them, the more you are pushing them away.\n\nTo recap:\n1) Your wants/desires about this baby DO NOT MATTER when it comes to planning to see her. Her parents get to make that decision.\n\n2) Read the room. Your son and DIL don't want you around--at least not for such long visits. Start smaller, and they might be more admenable to you coming over.\n\n3) LISTEN. For the love of the gods, listen to what everyone here is telling you. The more you say \"but\" the less chance you have of fixing what is wrong here.\n\nTry visiting r/justnomil and see if you see any of your own behaviors reflected in some of those posts.", "your not listening to anyone plainly.  you cant just go and visit without checking.  call james and ask him when a good time is and tell him that you want to get close to your grandchild.  if u cant do that then cancel the trip u can get a refund or credit anyway.", "YTA even if you do cancel. You don\u2019t get to bully your way into visiting when you\u2019re not welcome.", "I don\u2019t know how many times this will need to be said, no one, absolutely no one, outside of the parents of any given baby, have any right whatsoever to bond or spend time with the child. End of discussion. It is always 100%, without question, non-negotiable, at the parents discretion. Any attempts by grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, to circumvent the decision of the parents is an AH. It\u2019s unacceptable, it\u2019s disrespectful of boundaries, there is no such thing as \u201cyour time\u201d with their daughter. You are owed exactly zero time with a child you did not give birth to. It\u2019s rough, but thems the breaks. Also, you \u201ctried to be involved with Lily\u2019s birth\u201d?? Dude, your boundary violations that aren\u2019t listed in this post are probably insane. Enjoy your NC or restraining order. YTA.\n\nEdit: After reading your comments, get therapy. You\u2019re completely out of control, this is stalking and harassment, it\u2019s illegal and you genuinely need help. I\u2019m not trying to be mean. Seriously, get help.

You really really need it", "Info: why did you post if you're not taking*any* of the YTA and constructive criticism to heart?\n\nBlowing past boundaries is not the basis of a healthy relationship.

In 2 weeks, a couple who wanted you there would have allowed you plenty of time with Lily, but instead Maya *literally was hiding from you*.\n\nThen you have the audacity to schedule ANOTHER trip, less than a month later, with your husband (who your son does not like), and NOT tell your son or the mother of his child? Do you not understand that your visits are clearly draining for them? No matter what chores you are volunteering to do to help, it's clearly not a positive for them, and you should have figured that out in the first visit.\n\nEverything in your post is about you -- about your needs, your desire to be with a grandchild despite the fact the child's mother is still very newly postpartum, your feelings. Stop being so self-centered, step back, and respect that James and his partner don't want your visit. Maybe you should try actually ASKING what help you could provide to make their lives easier before imposing yourself on your child's family.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You have no respect for your son or his girlfriend. You don\u2019t respect boundaries. This is such entitled behavior.

One thing they can\u2019t say is you never tried but back off. Cancel the trip or at least spend your time doing something for yourself and let them know you\u2019re still around if they decide they want to see you during that time. You can\u2019t just force yourself on them because it\u2019s your kid involved. He\u2019s not a baby anymore and has his own family to worry about now. You can\u2019t dictate grown peoples lives and the more you push the more they will push.", "YTA. You really need to read the room....they DONT want you there when it doesn't suit them. If you continue to ignore their needs & push yourself into their lives (which is so disrespectful) then they will cut you out completely.

They thought they moved far enough away from you to only find out they were wrong.  Seeing as you are still going in January as nothing your family is telling you or whatever Reddit is trying to tell you is going to be ignored, make sure you have hotel reservations as I can almost gurantee you won't be welcome in the home for longer than an  hour or two at a time.

You need to start to come to terms with the fact that you may never have a relationship with your son or your granddaughter. You need so much therapy I can't even voice it. And I don't know why you continue to read everybody here on a post you made looking for opinions and just arguing rather than accepting what everyone is saying about you. You need help.

And getting a restraining order against someone who showed up after being told me not to and called  locksmith would be easy.", "Listen lady you have hundreds of people explain why YTA and you keep repeating the same things. Maybe try to read and listen to what people are saying. Understand the hints, they don\u2019t answer the phone when you call, they don\u2019t want you around, the mother of the child does not like you and that gives her every right to not want to have her child spend time with you, and your son \u201cseems happy enough\u201d when you show up. I think you\u2019re delusional. Understand they need space, offer help, and see what happens. Don\u2019t JUST INVITE YOURSELF OVER.

Showing up unannounced will only place more tension in the relationship. They will make plans if.when they want you to come. If they aren\u2019t making plans now, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want you there. It\u2019s not your decision to make on if you are allowed in their home and with their child, or not.

I\u2019d go no contact with you so fast if you were my mom/MIL.", "You sound deeply unhinged. You\u2019re going to lose a relationship with your son and granddaughter and it will be only your own fault. Seek therapy for yourself because you are clearly unwell. YTA", "Definitely YTA. My mom pulled the same stunt and I absolutely refused to open the door for her. It's so disrespectful and not to mention, they're new parents. New parents react differently; some want help, and others want their space, privacy and time to adjust. And it's clear, James and Maya want their space. So just give it to them.", "Holy shit! YTA ...you do realise it's not all about you. \n\nIf you don't back off and do it quickly you will not just lose time with Lily you will lose time with James because if he hasn't already is about 1 text message away from completely cutting you out if his life.\nLeave. Them. Alone.", "Goddamn there is a lot to unpack here\u2026\n\nFirst off if you don\u2019t start respecting space you are going to lose them. At this point you are already on the downhill slope. You have a savior complex as evidence by your writing when you say you have been through life and know what\u2019s what as well as saying you what lily to develop properly despite young parents. If you keep down this path you are going to lose them. 100% the way you explain how you are around maya is not true. You cannot keep those comments to yourself when you judge (I\u2019ve seen enough of your reply\u2019s to see it)and even though you think you say them delicately you do not. Its why they don\u2019t like you. \n\nSecond your attempt at therapy was half assed in the right direction, except you stopped there. You think therapy is something to use to get you and your kid and his gf to see on even ground that gets you to see lily. IT IS NOT. It is to understand the things that are not working and improve oneself in the areas that are not constructive. If you really want another chance at seeing them earnestly go to therapy yourself alone and have a real HONEST discussion with that person and see if they agree with you. I\u2019m guessing youd be surprised. Doing that alone will show them you are willing to give effort to mend the relationship but honestly you already have one foot in the grave in this situation\u2026and they don\u2019t seem like a couple that is willing to put up with anymore BS\n\nI hope you figure it out quick. Good luck\n\n\nOh and yea. YTA", "YTA. Grand parenting is a privilege- and if their antipathy is being expressed so clearly, there\u2019s a bloody good reason why- no doubt the unapproved visits (bad form on their own) are just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nBet you my last $5 that OP is full of unsolicited advice, judgement based on outdated information and way less help than she thinks she provided.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s no coincidence that the other grandchildren have been kept away for a number of years AND that James and Maya live 7hrs away\u2026clearly not far enough away for their peace of mind.\n\nPS\u2026OP I reckon your husband is low-key embarrassed by you, and you should absolutely heed his advice", "YTA.  They said NO.   Being a grandparent is NOT a right, it is a privilege. \n\nNow, some parts of your post and comments raised MAJOR red flags.   The biggest one however, is the fact that you seem to believe that your \u201cright to be a grandparent\u201d trumps anything and everything the parents want.  \n\nPlease review your understanding of consent.  \n\nPlease also consider that if you show up anyway, there is a VERY high chance that you will never ever see your grandchild again, and your son may even consider a restraining order.   \n\nI saw that your son is LC due to the family being draining, it would take much for him to jump to NC. \n\nI will also point out that it is VERY easy to build rapport with a child, even when it gets to toddler age or older.  I am unsure why this is an issue, but it appears that multiple children of yours are LC, and keep their children away, maybe ask yourself what the common denominator is.", "So\u2026you can\u2019t understand boundaries because you think YOURS NEEDS as a grandma are more important than the needs of the babies MOTHER\u2026\n\nYou had a shit marriage and your son doesn\u2019t like your new husband.
