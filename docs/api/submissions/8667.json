If you talk about non work related things at work, is 'friend' that much of a stretch? A good friend of mine was never able to hang out outside of work...we worked together for years but never saw each other outside of that 9-5. Turns out she had a controlling and abusive partner and our friendship at work was the only one she really had.\n\nIf someone calls themselves 'overweight' do you have to correct them and say they're technically obese? Not really. Let some things slide.", "YTA - Sorry but do you have the habit of just not letting things go and moving on? was it necessary to humiliate them *again* when they tried to save face and you specified you weren\u2019t joking?\n\nUltimately this comes down to someone trying to say something nice to you and you hurting their feelings.", "YTA for unnecessarily, telling your coworker off like that. If this was in public, it would have been incredibly embarrassing for your coworker. You should\u2019ve just let it go and gone off into the sunset. \n\nI have people at work who I consider work friends, but not personal friends. I\u2019ve even had coworkers I became friends with after leaving the office, but not while I was there. \n\nFor all, you know that coworker could\u2019ve been turning you down to hang out because they had personal problems. \n\nIt\u2019s within your rights to tell this person that they aren\u2019t your friend but would it hurt long term for you to just nod and never see them again?", "YTA. It was completely unnecessary. You're not an asshole for thinking it, but saying it was an asshole move. And after reading the comments I'm shocked how many people think that's acceptable. It sounds like you were just being petty because you think she snubbed you, it's not a good look.", "What exactly you gained by correcting her? You left your job as asshole in their eyes.

Nobody is gonna remember your extremely precise take on a common concept (friendship), but they *will* remember how rude you were completely out of the blue. Your coworker is probably wondering what on earth they did wrong to make you so upset at them. Depressingly, the answer is nothing. You got so caught up in your own head you seem to have forgotten the other person, who was simply trying to let you know they appreciated you and would miss you. Now they think you hate them, but you just hate... inconsistent definitions, I guess?\n\nPerhaps being directly told someone insignificant to you likes and appreciates you made you uncomfortable and you lashed out.

I find it so annoying when people at work talk about how we're all \"friends\" or, worse, \"Family\".  No. We're not.  I have friends and I have family. They aren't at my workplace.  I find it dishonest and yeah, it's annoying.   \n\nWould I have done what you did?  Probably not, but I also don't see a problem.  If someone wants to be classed as a friend, then they need to act like one.  If they choose not to, that's their choice.", "English needs to use word acquaintance more, this is typical to have stratification in my home country between friend and acquaintance and use appropriate word for right people,", "NTA for not considering her not a friend, but you could have just smiled and let it go.

Seriously, what would it have hurt you if you\u2019d just ignored that they kept calling you their friend?", "NTA. I think social media is somewhat to blame with this obsession with being everyone's friend. I have exactly the same mindset as you. If you don't hang out outside of work or have lengthy non-work related chats outside of work then you are just work colleagues, you're not friends.", "This is hilarious. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBut what exactly did you have to gain by pushing your definition?\n\nIf anything, I'd have let it slide. Because in my many years of working, I've somehow reconnected unexpectedly with old colleagues. Some who became critical in my professional growth. Some who became friends. \n\nLabels can be helpful for boundary setting. But you were about to leave. So at that point, why make such a stand?", "NTA. I have a similar definition of friends vs. coworkers or colleagues. Not every coworker I talk to on a regular basis is a friend. If we start doing things outside of work or start to talk about more personal things then a friendship starts to develop.\n\nI just moved and talked about it with my coworkers - technically something personal - I still wouldn't consider them friends at this point. It might become a friendship at some point, but not there yet. Maybe it is bc of the numerous bad experiences with so-called friends that I am just messed up - but friendship takes time to develop and takes a certain amount of trust and other things. Just because we talk during a break at work or during work doesn't mean we're friends.", "I'm torn because I agree with you on the distinction between friends and coworkers/colleagues.  But maybe it's not so cool to argue about it.  You're leaving your job.  Does it matter if Coworker calls you a friend if you're not going to see them again?\n\nNAH, but if this comes up again, maybe let it slide.  No need to argue semantics if you're not going to see them again.", "NAH. Friend can mean many different things, especially when people come from different cultures. And especially the phrase \"I don't consider us to be friends\" is often meant as hostile. Simple miscommunication by both of you. I'd say an apology and clarification is in order.", "YTA. If you\u2019re leaving the job anyway then you exposed yourself as a petty and spiteful person. Nod politely and go live the rest of your life. It sounds like you embarrassed yourself.", "YTA, and that was unnecessary. It sounds like you wanted to be friends and felt rejected, and I wonder if that\u2019s why you were so cruel about it.", "YTA, and if this was in front of other people, doubly so. \n\nINFO: are you on The Spectrum?", "YTA\n\nWhat difference does it make if that person considered you a friend, even if you did not?  It wasn't as if you were ever going to see that person again.  All you had to say was, \"I'm going to miss you too\" or \"It's been fun\" or \"I enjoyed working with you\".  Anything.  \n\nDo you tell people that you find unattractive \"Hey, ugly person!\" to their face?  Do you tell kids \"You know all that stuff they say about kids having unlimited potential?  It's trash.  You're a stupid kid and you're going to grow up to be a stupid adult.\"\n\nWhy do you feel the need to express every thought in your head?", "As most here have asserted, YTA. If you enjoyed their presence at work, as you stated, then that makes your relationship with your coworker to be (or have been, I guess) at the very least on friendly terms, hence it's not a stretch for them to consider you a friend and vice versa. You explicitly telling them otherwise basically means that you did not, or no longer consider such friendly/cordial relationship to exist. If you didn't mean that, you're a socially awkward idiot that needs some help with interpersonal communications. If you meant that, and it wasn't because they did something wrong but just a matter of semantics in your mind, then you're a humongous AH for saying that and ruining whatever positive relationship was present between you and them.", "YTA.

I agree with him especially if he has tried to interact with these people outside of work and they've repeatedly said no I'd say that's a pretty clear distinction", "People have too lose a definition for friends. Mine is closer to yours, to me friends are those people who are there when I need them, who I text in my free time, who I hang out with in my free time, with whom I have interests in common that do not revolve around work. If I only talk about work with you, we are not friends. You probably don't know anything about me. Not for real. \n\nHaving said that, it's not nice to rub it in other people's face. You were leaving soon, them calling you a friend wouldn't affect you. You could have simply answered \"I'll miss working with you too\" and end it at that. Now there's unnecessary drama, YTA", "I worked somewhere once for just a few months. I had lots of nice conversation with one particular coworker who was also new. When I left I gave some platitude about staying in touch and she said that she didn't really keep in touch with coworkers and was ok with people being in her life for just a season, but that she had liked working with me. I was kind of shocked and a bit hurt but of course she was right! We didn't text or hang out outside of work and were unlikely to keep in touch. I was just taken aback by how straightforward she was. Now it's not something I think about but I did at first. If I had worked with her for years, I think her bluntness may have been more hurtful. Your sentiment may not have been wrong but your insistence that someone isn't your friend certainly is cold. \n\nYTA because although you are free to designate people in your life however you want, what was the point of this interaction beyond hurting and upsetting someone? You sound upset that they haven't taken you up on your offer to hang out so you feel the pretty need to put them in their place. It just wasn't necessary even if it was true. The truth remains the same even if you don't speak it. Next time, just go on with your life and let people live theirs.", "YTA. sometimes just shut up.", "NTA. \n\nWhat you should have told her when she said you were an ah for making her upset.

I've been there. One person at a former job was convinced we were friends and I really didn't want to be with this person cause they were a bit of a dick and I didn't like them.

Some questions to consider: are you highly sensitive to bright or flashing lights, or loud sounds (e.g., do you sometimes have to use noise cancelling headphones in crowded spaces)? Do you find that people often get frustrated with you for \"being too literal\" or misreading a social situation? Are you puzzled by the idea of \"reading someone's body language,\" and not really sure what that means, or how someone would do it? Do you often encounter social pushback for \"being too blunt\"? Do you find that it's easier to talk \"at\" people about a topic you're interested in than engage in two-way back-and-forth? Do you highly prioritize a consistent routine and get upset when things change?\n\nI'm definitely *not* trying to armchair diagnose you over the internet, OP, but this post reminds me so much of neurodivergent people in my life that I'm not really comfortable giving you a Y-T-A without knowing more. If any of those questions feel familiar, that doesn't mean anything on its own, but it may be worth exploring further.", "YTA. You made an innocuous comment from your coworker into something big and weird.
