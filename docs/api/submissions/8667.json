I just left a job that I had for over 2 years. During that time I had come to like many of my coworkers but I didn\u2019t consider them to be friends as, in my opinion, friends are people who you hang out with and are able to text/ call out of the blue. I understand that my opinion of \u201cfriend\u201d may not be the universal definition of friend but I have used this definition in my life and I consider people who fit the above description friends. All others are coworkers and colleagues. So if I don\u2019t hang out or text you about non work related things then I am not your friend. \n\nOn my last day at work, a former coworker of my mine kept saying they would miss me and kept referring to me as their friend. I reminded them that while I enjoy their company at work, I don\u2019t consider us to be friends. They were confused as they thought we were. I reminded them that every time I asked them to hang out outside of work, they would say no and would give reasons that ranged from understandable to one\u2019s that were, well obvious that they didn\u2019t want to hang out with me. I soon realized that maybe we weren\u2019t going to be friends and that I had a coworker that was a colleague who I could talk to during work hours. I let them know that  I only consider people my friend if I hang out with them outside of work. They tried to laugh it off as if I was not being serious. I told them I was serious and that I would consider them a coworker. They got upset and said that friends come in all different varieties and that we were friends because we had conversations at work. I politely informed them, that while they might see that as a friendship, I did not. I saw us as coworkers. \n\nMy coworker got quiet and didn\u2019t continue the conversation. They then called me an asshole for making them upset. I was confused as it was a cordial conversation. Am I the asshole for making my coworker upset that I didn\u2019t consider them a friend?\n\nEdit:  I forget that sometimes I don\u2019t write out what I\u2019m thinking. Just for clarification, the reason I said I did not see us a friends was because this person would go out and hang out with other people from the office and would tell me about it during lunch. Whenever I would ask to hang out it would always be a polite, no thank you. And that is fine. That would make us just coworkers. Maybe I am being petty. Coincidentally, I also have friends that I hang out with outside of work from this job.", "created_utc": 1675060949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ov4ss/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_making_a_coworker_upset/", "score": 1178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you talk about non work related things at work, is 'friend' that much of a stretch? A good friend of mine was never able to hang out outside of work...we worked together for years but never saw each other outside of that 9-5. Turns out she had a controlling and abusive partner and our friendship at work was the only one she really had.\n\nIf someone calls themselves 'overweight' do you have to correct them and say they're technically obese?

If this was in public, it would have been incredibly embarrassing for your coworker.

I\u2019ve even had coworkers I became friends with after leaving the office, but not while I was there. \n\nFor all, you know that coworker could\u2019ve been turning you down to hang out because they had personal problems. \n\nIt\u2019s within your rights to tell this person that they aren\u2019t your friend but would it hurt long term for you to just nod and never see them again?", "YTA. It was completely unnecessary. You're not an asshole for thinking it, but saying it was an asshole move. And after reading the comments I'm shocked how many people think that's acceptable. It sounds like you were just being petty because you think she snubbed you, it's not a good look.", "What exactly you gained by correcting her? You left your job as asshole in their eyes.

Nobody is gonna remember your extremely precise take on a common concept (friendship), but they *will* remember how rude you were completely out of the blue. Your coworker is probably wondering what on earth they did wrong to make you so upset at them. Depressingly, the answer is nothing. You got so caught up in your own head you seem to have forgotten the other person, who was simply trying to let you know they appreciated you and would miss you. Now they think you hate them, but you just hate... inconsistent definitions, I guess?\n\nPerhaps being directly told someone insignificant to you likes and appreciates you made you uncomfortable and you lashed out.

I find it so annoying when people at work talk about how we're all \"friends\" or, worse, \"Family\".  No. We're not.  I have friends and I have family. They aren't at my workplace.  I find it dishonest and yeah, it's annoying.   \n\nWould I have done what you did?  Probably not, but I also don't see a problem.  If someone wants to be classed as a friend, then they need to act like one.  If they choose not to, that's their choice.", "English needs to use word acquaintance more, this is typical to have stratification in my home country between friend and acquaintance and use appropriate word for right people,", "NTA for not considering her not a friend, but you could have just smiled and let it go.

Seriously, what would it have hurt you if you\u2019d just ignored that they kept calling you their friend?", "NTA. I think social media is somewhat to blame with this obsession with being everyone's friend. I have exactly the same mindset as you. If you don't hang out outside of work or have lengthy non-work related chats outside of work then you are just work colleagues, you're not friends.", "This is hilarious. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBut what exactly did you have to gain by pushing your definition?\n\nIf anything, I'd have let it slide. Because in my many years of working, I've somehow reconnected unexpectedly with old colleagues. Some who became critical in my professional growth. Some who became friends. \n\nLabels can be helpful for boundary setting. But you were about to leave. So at that point, why make such a stand?", "NTA. I have a similar definition of friends vs. coworkers or colleagues. Not every coworker I talk to on a regular basis is a friend. If we start doing things outside of work or start to talk about more personal things then a friendship starts to develop.\n\nI just moved and talked about it with my coworkers - technically something personal - I still wouldn't consider them friends at this point. It might become a friendship at some point, but not there yet. Maybe it is bc of the numerous bad experiences with so-called friends that I am just messed up - but friendship takes time to develop and takes a certain amount of trust and other things. Just because we talk during a break at work or during work doesn't mean we're friends.", "I'm torn because I agree with you on the distinction between friends and coworkers/colleagues.  But maybe it's not so cool to argue about it.  You're leaving your job.  Does it matter if Coworker calls you a friend if you're not going to see them again?\n\nNAH, but if this comes up again, maybe let it slide.  No need to argue semantics if you're not going to see them again.", "NAH. Friend can mean many different things, especially when people come from different cultures. And especially the phrase \"I don't consider us to be friends\" is often meant as hostile. Simple miscommunication by both of you. I'd say an apology and clarification is in order.", "YTA. If you\u2019re leaving the job anyway then you exposed yourself as a petty and spiteful person. Nod politely and go live the rest of your life. It sounds like you embarrassed yourself.", "YTA, and that was unnecessary.

It wasn't as if you were ever going to see that person again.  All you had to say was, \"I'm going to miss you too\" or \"It's been fun\" or \"I enjoyed working with you\".  Anything.  \n\nDo you tell people that you find unattractive \"Hey, ugly person!\" to their face?  Do you tell kids \"You know all that stuff they say about kids having unlimited potential?  It's trash.  You're a stupid kid and you're going to grow up to be a stupid adult.\"\n\nWhy do you feel the need to express every thought in your head?", "As most here have asserted, YTA. If you enjoyed their presence at work, as you stated, then that makes your relationship with your coworker to be (or have been, I guess) at the very least on friendly terms, hence it's not a stretch for them to consider you a friend and vice versa. You explicitly telling them otherwise basically means that you did not, or no longer consider such friendly/cordial relationship to exist. If you didn't mean that, you're a socially awkward idiot that needs some help with interpersonal communications. If you meant that, and it wasn't because they did something wrong but just a matter of semantics in your mind, then you're a humongous AH for saying that and ruining whatever positive relationship was present between you and them.", "YTA.

I think the same as you. Friends are people outside work that you hang out with. At home, out at dinner, movie night, and other extracurricular activities. Coworkers are just that. People who work in the same office or job as you that you have a cordial relationship with. This kind of rigid separation is common of people on the spectrum who take the meaning of words literally and separated by type. Nothing wrong with how we think. Just different. We also lack inflection when speaking about things and we don\u2019t mean certain things in the way others would take them in different situations. Our social skills are sometimes stunted and difficult. As a woman it is different than the men but it stays relatively similar in most ways. Women are slightly more able to read situations because they are a social group whereas men tend to be a bit standoff ish in how they interact. What was said verbally literally here was taken as emotional because most neurotypical people have a hard time separating the emotional self from the literal self. \n\nSocially with neurotypical people a comment like this that hurt the feelings of another the first time but you insisted on the separation another time in the same span would make you the AH. \n\nYou may make the separation between things rigid but most people would stop insisting when they noticed the sad body language. They would be like maybe we could hang out sometime and develop a closer bond. Maybe they could explore the possibility of friendship.

Why does it matter if that guy though you two were friends when you're leaving anyway and your only interaction was at work?", "Soft YTA. People have different definitions of the word \u201cfriend\u201d and yours is highly specific. You can\u2019t expect others to know or abide by it, and correcting your coworker the way you did was a little harsh.\n\nI find it useful to categorize within the \u201cfriend\u201d umbrella. Your definition of friend is what I would call a close friend or inner-circle friend. These are the people you text at all hours, call on for help, and expect to call on you for help. Would I drive them to the airport or help with housekeeping if they were sick or injured? That\u2019s a close friend. \n\nThen there are the outer circle folks - the more casual friends I might hang out with and enjoy, but we are not particularly close. Over time, they may or may not move to the inner circle. We probably have some sort of activity or interest in common and that is likely how we met. We might only hang out when doing that activity, or we might hang outside of it, but they are not the people I text for help or a sympathetic ear. \n\nAnd then there are work friends. These people are my friends, but only at work. There is no other hanging out, no communication outside of work hours unless it\u2019s work-related. I might enjoy these folks quite a bit, but I keep them behind the boundary of \u201cwork friend\u201d. They don\u2019t enter into my personal life. Again, sometimes a person will cross over from work friend to actual friend, typically outer circle and then maybe moving to inner over time. There\u2019s no system for this - it happens or it doesn\u2019t. I would call them \u201cwork friend\u201d rather than \u201ccoworker\u201d, because a coworker would be someone I work alongside but don\u2019t have any non-work interaction with at all - we never talk about our weekends or have lunch together. We just work in the same place. \n\nThere are also \u201cfriendly acquaintances\u201d, people I like and enjoy but just don\u2019t spend a lot of time with and don\u2019t know very well. These are outer-outer circle. Friends of friends, perhaps.\n\nI don\u2019t tell people what kind of friend they are, and I won\u2019t correct someone I wouldn\u2019t call a friend if they say I am theirs, unless there is a good reason to do so - like they are trying to use the idea of friendship for leverage, or if they are inappropriately clingy, etc. It\u2019s more about knowing my own boundaries and who I trust with what. It\u2019s not something I need to broadcast. \n\nI do think using an overly specific definition of the word friend - saying someone is only your friend if they are inner circle - can be hurtful to others. You might feel that way, but if an outer circle or work friend refers to you as their friend, the kind thing is to let it slide and assume they are just using a looser definition of the word, which, honestly, most people do.", "I think rather than a judgement per say, I\u2019ll go with that this was a time to have just kept your mouth shut.\n\nYour coworker was being nice and basically just saying they would miss you.

Well, another coworker noticed my distress and pulled me into her cubicle and asked me what was wrong. I explained the situation. She asked me if we hung out outside of work, I said no, she asked point blank do we sleep with each other or have any romantic feelings I said no, she asked if she had any control or say on how I live my life, I said no, then she said \u201cwell, your coworkers, your not friends, not lovers, and not related, so let it roll off your back and don\u2019t take it personal\u201d after that, I began looking at people I work with differently and it helped me understand the difference between coworkers and friends. You have to separate, because if you get yourself emotionally involved with every coworker that you get along with you will get hurt and disappointed. You are not the asshole.", "Going against the grain with NTA.", "Yta for being passive aggressive for no reason other than the satisfaction letting them know they aren't shit to you. \n\nDont get me wrong Idgaf about anyone, but i dont go out of my way to make them feel or that our time together was insignificant. \n\nYou have a strong line for friendship, some people draw that line elsewhere, your entitlement thinks you have the correct version.", "You are not being petty.\n\nFrankly being friendly with co workers outside of work is not a really good idea.\n\nAnd you stood firm by your principals.\n\nYou are NOT responsible for anyone else's feelings.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. The person never wanted to hang out with you after work even after you offered on several occasions. Who cares about their feelings when they didn't care about yours?", "YTA. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to just pacify someone. \u201cFriend\u201d is such a broad term that could range anywhere from your best friend who you see all the time and donated a kidney to, to an acquaintance you have a generally favorable opinion of.  And claiming someone as a friend doesn\u2019t mean anything, anyway. You don\u2019t actually have to be friends with them just because you agreed (or didnt disagree when they claimed) that younwere friends. I mean hell, when someone wants to turn someone down from a date, they\u2019ll say \u201ci think we should just be friends\u201d when Im sure, lots of the time, they dont want to even be friends with them. \n\nLike there are some people at work Ill talk to and hang out with at work that I\u2019d call work friends. Ive never hung out with them, but we get along at work. Work is like it\u2019s own little world, often times.", "Absolutely NTA. You tried to be friendly and she declined. That's fine she has every right to do that.\n\nBut you dont get to constantly deny friendship to someone and then get upset when they say you arent their friend.", "YTA  \"Yeah I'll miss you too.  Bye.\"", "Could just let it go, leave the job and move on with your life but it sounds like you were hurt by their rejection to hang out and felt the need to prove a point.", "YTA.\n\nUnless this person is a clingy, clueless barnacle who can't take a hint, then you were cold-hearted and mean to say that. People have different definitions of \"friend.\" You could have just let her comment slide. But you had to drive your point home. Are you on the spectrum?", "NTA", "YTA. While I share your distinction between friends and co workers, I would never have corrected a co worker who called me their friend. There's no point and, as you saw, it leads to hurt feelings. You could have let her call you a friend, no harm no foul.", "NTA-you corrected their perception of your relationship and nothing was wrong with that. If you got a flat in the middle of the night would you be able to call that person for help if no they are not a friend. Just because you have polite conversations with people does not make them your friend. Letting people know where they stand with you is not an asshole move it is a great one that more people should use.", "INFO: Are you neurodivergent?", "NTA. You are right. That person is trying to act like you are friends when in reality they didn't want to go beyond being coworkers. They are upset that you said something that is true. Not your problem...", "NAH Different definitions of friendship only. That said, you dont have to say everything out loud and hurt everyone's feelings.", "NTA", "NTA. I suppose it was ill advised what you did burning that bridge, but whatever, I support your pettiness here. People who for whatever reason like to keep up the pretence of being friends but never follow up with any action to demonstrate that are beyond annoying. You yourself said you reached out and they never wanted to hang out, even when doing so with others. Which is fine, but why go the extra mile pretending you are great friends? Maybe you are moving up and they wanted to make sure they can call on you for networking or a favour, who knows.", "NTA but maybe next time just don't say what's on your mind? It's more polite to just end the conversation and be done with it then drag it on to get your point across. \n\nSide note: I completely agree with you, friends vs coworkers thing. But again, it was your last day, you already didn't talk to them out of work, what harm could it have hurt to just not continue the conversation and say your goodbyes at work?", "Social media has devalued the word \u201cfriend\u201d.\nNTA for being honest.", "NTA. And they are unprofessional for calling you an asshole for simply explaining your boundaries.", "Generally I would agree with this.  I call coworkers \u2018work friends\u2019, which means people I am friendly with at work, but seldom extends past the occasional loaning of a personal item, or bringing in cookies.\n\nHOWEVER, in this case, op TRIED to be friends with this person, and was rebuffed.  Coworker made it clear they were just coworkers, through her actions.  The, on ops last day, tried to claim a relationship That SHE didn\u2019t want to have.  I would have called out such a hypocritical person, too, if they repeatedly kept going on about it.\n\nWhen I told my \u2018work friends\u2019 that I was retiring (and I had DOZENS, if not 100, due to the roving nature of my job, some just voices on the phone that I talked and joked with everyday), they all said they would miss me, and were sad to see me go.  But none claimed to be losing a good friend, as that wasn\u2019t our relationship.  In 35 years, their were only 2 people I would call friends.", "What the coworker did wrong is repeatedly turn down attempts at an actual friendship, rub in OP face the actual friendship they have with other coworkers and then pretend to be a friend on OP last day when they clearly weren't.", "Also what if for whatever reason you need something from this person for whatever reason. Obviously it\u2019s not good to think of people only in terms of how they can benefit you but no reason to needlessly burn a bridge with someone who you\u2019re on good terms with.", "How Aristotelian of you, very well put. OP, YTA, keep in mind those three questions for future interactions.", "I don't think there's anything wrong with telling someone that you're not friends if you've actively made friendly overtures and they've dodged every one, while also telling you about out-of-office activities with other co-workers.  It may not be polite, but it's not OP who made the decision that they wouldn't be friends.", "Boundary that a lot of people go to work to get paid and not make friends. Pretty simple and straight forward honestly", "NTA OP.  I don't get all the YTA's people are calling you.  Everybody is addressing about how you made that person feel but most commenting here didn't think about how you felt by this person rejecting hanging out with you but would hang out with other co-workers and then had the NERVE to tell you at work about their hanging out.\n\nNo you just stated fact because that person never made you feel like or treated you like a actual friend.  FUCK that \"take the high road\" BS, especially since you weren't rude but just stating facts.  And those bringing up, \"That was your last day and you would never see that person again\", well again, BS because the sooner or later, somewhere, some place, chance is, you will run into that person again.  And when that happen, you don't need hear that fake \"My friend\" crap.\n\nI agree with your interpretation of what friends are and do.  Anything below that are either acquaintances or co-workers.", "What was your intent? Why was it important for them to know your specific definition? What purpose were you serving?", "Yeah but it's still rude to tell someone point blank they they aren't your friend when they call themselves your friend. Especially in the context of them saying they will miss you. Even if this person did just like OP more than OP liked them, there's no reason to make them feel bad by pointing them out if they aren't pushing for more of a relationship than OP wants.", "I'm autistic and consider anyone I spend a lot of time conversing with to be a friend. It would hurt to be told this in my opinion. \n\nI talk to coworkers more than my boyfriend, why wouldn't I call them my friends yknow?", "\"The cut doesnt flatter your shape\" does the trick for me. I also am autistic and a lot of my friends are fat and want the truth, so a solid \"yes, lets find a better one\" is fine as long as you have time to help them", "OP: why not both?", "I do find it pretty weird how hard people are on OP but not at all on the other person. Like OP could be much more polite but they are basically right. They weren't friends.", "This is why I don't think OP's really an AH. If you turn down the request to hang out, how can you consider yourself their friend? And to go out with other people and discuss it with OP after not inviting them, that's something an AH would do. Sure, it was probably a bit rude and unnecessary to correct them, but it doesn't feel completely unwanted.", "That's a fair point", "But this also applies to the other person. They saying something that just isn't true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow most people would just smile and agree but OP is right. They weren't friends.", "It's not a lie. A friend isn't some sacred relationship defined by a specific sort of bonding ritual. It can simply be someone you chat with at work. If OP was never going to see that person outside of work again once they left, why bother trying to correct someone over and over with their super specific and unusual definition of friend? At the very least, why keep pushing it once they laughed it off? What's the point in that? You already told them the supposed truth. \n\nThe \"just being honest\" types are assholes because they don't care about other people and how other people feel. There are always ways to say things that still aren't lies and also don't hurt other people.", "Skimmed your comment too fast, didn't see the \"never\" at first. Lmao, I was like wow you're super mean", "Then you can, in clear conscience, answer \"no, the dress does not make you look fat.\" You just don't have to specify that it's the fat that makes them look fat, if that is in fact the case. You only have to answer the question they ask!", "I've been burned by this enough before that I get very detailed on what I want from people sometimes. Like, I'm never gonna ask someone if I look fat, but I often ask people for advice on spending money. Sometimes I want their genuine opinion on whether something is worth the money. Sometimes I want them to tell me to save my money even if it's worth it, because I want someone to keep me on track. And sometimes I want someone to validate a purchase even if it might not actually be worth the money.\n\n\"Please validate my decision to (buy this thing/wear this outfit/do this activity/not do that activity/etc)\" has saved me so many times.", "You can be an asshole unintentionally. Pretty much all of us have been or will be. That\u2019s what apologies are for.", "This is why I don\u2019t understand people calling the Op An arsehole. If I had repeatedly asked somebody I wanted to hang out with and liked out and he said no and gave all of the excuses under the Sun that\u2019s fine. But for them to  go around and act like we were friends even after the way that I Had been treated I would tell them to get fucked too. That\u2019s emotionally manipulative behaviour and I\u2019m glad the op called it out, Autistic or otherwise.\n\nNTA", "Did you even read the post? The coworkers said no to hanging out multiple times while she readily hung out with other people in the office. They only ever talked inside the work building. That is not a friend, it is a coworker. Simply being friendly toward someone does not make them a friend. A friend is a choice, and OP knew he was not on level with her actual workplace friends. If anything, she's the AH for whimpering when someone she repeatedly refused to hang out with said they aren't friends.\n\nAs for not caring how other people feel, do you apply that to the coworker who said no multiple times to hanging out after work, but still expected OP to be a friend?", "No one was forcing OP to socialize with them at work. They did it because they wanted to. They had other people they considered friends at work, and still chose to socialize with this person instead. If that's not some level of friendship, I don't know what is.", "Bluntness is def an autism thing, what??", "Clearly op disagrees lol", "YTA and on top of that not very bright. You never want to burn a bridge you don't have to with coworkers. You had someone who considered you a friend and who could have served as a future reference but you instead bombed them with a \"you're not my friend\". They will remember that and depending on the industry you're in that can follow you. It would have taken nothing to just let her think you were friends. Sometimes you can just keep shit to yourself.", "YTA. This was completely unnecessary and made me wonder if you are autistic. Next time have some grace and maturity to let things go instead of being so petty.", "YTA\n\nWhat does it hurt you for someone to think of you as a friend, and how do you not take that as a compliment. \n\nPerhaps your coworker has social anxiety or is an introvert, and your politeness(not \u201cfriendliness\u201d obviously) allowed them to break out of their shell and experience social interaction.", "YTA. She was being nice to you, it was unnecessary to correct her and let her know you don\u2019t consider her a friend. Would it have really hurt you to just swallow the rude comment and be kind? \u201cThanks so much for the well wishes, I\u2019ll miss working with you too.\u201d", "YTA. \"Work friend\" is a thing - someone you work with but is more than just someone you nod to in the hallway. It doesn't commit you to any closeness that you don't want and is clear that the relationship is only tied to work. Try practicing some tact.", "Question, are you a male and that co-worker a female? I've turned down hanging out with male coworkers because I didn't want them getting the idea that our relationship wasn't platonic (lots of dudes seem like they are just friendly especially at work and then suddenly make a move when they have their foot in the door in a different environment) and other times because I was in a relationship with someone who wouldn't have been okay with me hanging out with a male coworker. It feels like you are trying to \"punish\" this person by telling them you aren't friends because they didn't take you up on your offer to hang out but idk maybe you're just socially awkward and lack tact because most people wouldn't go out of their way to tell someone they aren't friends unless you're trying to hurt their feelings/be petty.", "NAH", "YTA, could have left it alone and it would have made no difference to your life", "Larry David, is that you? Hahaha!", "There are people that seem to enjoy saying out loud that they are \"not there to make friends.\" \n\nThat's ok. But it shouldn't be a surprise when you receive that same energy from others.", "I was about to jump on the y.t.a bandwagon, but your edit is swaying me towards NTA.

It just seems that now you're going, they're putting in some half-arsed attempt of any form of friendship. \n\nThey're just upset that you didn't pander to their B.S.", "NTA \nYou asked to hang out outside of work hours like a real friend. They declined. Only spoke to you at office.\nThat is a co worker. Not friend. You weren't mean in explaining that, just honest.", "I\u2019m gonna go with the minority, and say NTA. When someone goes out of their way to make it clear that they are not your friend, by constantly refusing any attempts to hang out, and then shares stories of going out with other co-workers, they have made it CLEAR that they are not friends with you. So, you have no responsibility to make nice and pretend to be friends with them. Especially if you are leaving anyway.", "OP I'm curious what you got out of that conversation? How was your life made better by insisting that your coworker is NOT your friend?\n\nSome towns are small, so are some industries. I hope you never cross paths with that person again because it seems you've burned a bridge. \n\nThe correct course of action would be to acknowledge their kind words, say you'll miss them to, and then move on to your new life.", "Info: are you and this coworker opposite sex? Were your invitations one on one and did they sound like dates?", "People like you are why I don\u2019t even bother being nice to people anymore. It\u2019s always going to be met with salty egotistical bullshit\n\nYTA and you apparently think you are so high and mighty that this person would dare see you as a friend. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t call her a peasant honestly.", "NTA", "YTA for just being unnecessarily unkind", "YTA- sounds like you got your feelings hurt and tried to reciprocate. You could have just said nothing and been the better person.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say NTA. Especially when you repeatedly asked them to hang out outside of work. People need to be checked sometimes.", "OP is NTA.\n\nI don't get the Y T A comments. If you've repeatedly asked to hang out with someone and they've denied your invitation each time whilst telling you about the several activities they had with other coworker friends, this person is not entitled to call me a friend. Regardless of it being OP's last day, why would you want to buy into that delusion when you know the truth? Enough with the \"social cues\" and insinuating OP is neurotypical when they're being matter of fact. Where were the coworker's \"social cues\" when he kept declining OP's hangout invitation?", "I'll go against the grain here, NTA. \n\nSpecifically for this one reason. \n\n> I reminded them that every time I asked them to hang out outside of work, they would say no and would give reasons that ranged from understandable to one\u2019s that were, well obvious that they didn\u2019t want to hang out with me.\n\nYou made an effort, they rejected it. You're coworkers. Just because you have conversation at work doesn't make you a 'friend.'", "I'm going against the grain here and say NTA. If you'd never made an attempt to engage outside of work then maybe you didn't need to say it. But while, yes, people have different definitions of friendship they blocked you from being anything more than a work \"pal\". They made zero effort to become friends. Eating together and making chitchat is maybe the start of a possible friendship, but friends run deeper that is traditionally ok at work. Because you know, you're working.", "Nta. NEVER MAKE FRIENDS WITH COWORKERS. I would never hang out with someone i work with. It's a risk I never take. Say the relationship  sours... now works awkward or hostile.", "YTA. Socially Inept.OP's coworker didn't lose anything when OP left.", "NTA at all . If they never want to hangout or talk outside of work then they aren't friends", "NTA but neither is the other person. It\u2019s just an unfortunate situation.", "I call myself a fat kid when I ask if they have my size in certain stores. LOL", "This comment is wayyy too far down for how honest and real it is!", "What bridge? The bridge that OP tried to build with the coworker and the coworker politely refused every time? Cause that bridge was never built in the first place so you can't burn it :b", "I agree this was petty and tactless but not an a h move. Honestly I would find this kind of directness quite refreshing.", "Who cares what they think? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "Sure, but that coworker you hung out with during lunch could be the contact that gets you a great job five years from now, etc. That's the bridge.", "YTA, you keep saying it wasn\u2019t your intent to hurt their feelings yet in your explanation you lay out your reason for saying so\u2026and it\u2019s petty. It absolutely was your intent to hurt them and now you\u2019re looking for brownie points on the Internet. Be a better human", "Not exactly sure you really know what that means. Do you realize how cold and robotic you read. You type like all of your coworkers were merely pathetic background noise to your master plan. Your self awareness is lacking beyond belief. You can claim you didn\u2019t mean harm all you want to but correcting someone that you are not friends isn\u2019t cordial. You are dropping her down a peg as you see it when she was nice enough to see you as a friend. Just bc you don\u2019t spin in a field of daises doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t fib and say something nice on your way out. Since according to you your never going to see her again anyway so it literally cost you nothing to come up with a nicer response", "Yeah, OP was faced with someone who they'd invited to spend time together in the past, but who said no. I'd be looking at them thinking, nah, you're really building your part up in my life here. Could she have let it slide? Of course. Was it wrong to correct them? I dont think so. NAH", "Yeah, my definition of friend is clearly different, hahah.\n\nI have at least 15-20 people I consider friends. And I'm a parent of two kids with a very demanding career. I'm hardly seeing everyone regularly. \n\nFriendship doesn't require constant contact, in my opinion.", "I would say NTA. Definitions vary. They made it more difficult by trying to explain their definition which was not the same as yours. Imagine if you said let\u2019s hang out, they declined and then you went and asked why not and continued to press. Similar thing just happened and they didn\u2019t like the answer.", "That\u2019s fine if she establishes that up\nFront, but she was leaving anyway. There is absolutely no need to hurt feelings on the way out the door.", "Not if you never, ever talk outside work. That's someone you will never speak to again in your life unless you physically run into them.", "That's literally not how friendships work", "Yeah the ah for that there\u2019s people I don\u2019t like at work and I I left I know they would never mention being my friend and me either nor would I ever ask to hang out with them but if someone I spoke to said I was their friend I would not say this."]}
