I reminded them that while I enjoy their company at work, I don\u2019t consider us to be friends. They were confused as they thought we were. I reminded them that every time I asked them to hang out outside of work, they would say no and would give reasons that ranged from understandable to one\u2019s that were, well obvious that they didn\u2019t want to hang out with me. I soon realized that maybe we weren\u2019t going to be friends and that I had a coworker that was a colleague who I could talk to during work hours. I let them know that  I only consider people my friend if I hang out with them outside of work. They tried to laugh it off as if I was not being serious. I told them I was serious and that I would consider them a coworker. They got upset and said that friends come in all different varieties and that we were friends because we had conversations at work. I politely informed them, that while they might see that as a friendship, I did not. I saw us as coworkers. \n\nMy coworker got quiet and didn\u2019t continue the conversation.

If you talk about non work related things at work, is 'friend' that much of a stretch? A good friend of mine was never able to hang out outside of work...we worked together for years but never saw each other outside of that 9-5. Turns out she had a controlling and abusive partner and our friendship at work was the only one she really had.\n\nIf someone calls themselves 'overweight' do you have to correct them and say they're technically obese? Not really. Let some things slide.", "YTA - Sorry but do you have the habit of just not letting things go and moving on? was it necessary to humiliate them *again* when they tried to save face and you specified you weren\u2019t joking?\n\nUltimately this comes down to someone trying to say something nice to you and you hurting their feelings.", "YTA for unnecessarily, telling your coworker off like that. If this was in public, it would have been incredibly embarrassing for your coworker. You should\u2019ve just let it go and gone off into the sunset. \n\nI have people at work who I consider work friends, but not personal friends. I\u2019ve even had coworkers I became friends with after leaving the office, but not while I was there. \n\nFor all, you know that coworker could\u2019ve been turning you down to hang out because they had personal problems. \n\nIt\u2019s within your rights to tell this person that they aren\u2019t your friend but would it hurt long term for you to just nod and never see them again?", "YTA. It was completely unnecessary. You're not an asshole for thinking it, but saying it was an asshole move. And after reading the comments I'm shocked how many people think that's acceptable. It sounds like you were just being petty because you think she snubbed you, it's not a good look.", "What exactly you gained by correcting her? You left your job as asshole in their eyes. You could leave it be, let her talk and move on. Wouldn't change your life, someone was just thinking good of you, considering you as a friend.\n\nI think it's YTA.", "Your last day there. You don't intend to see them again forever.\n\nYou 'correct them' on an issue that has no consequences. You even insist repeatedly.\n\nThat's pathetic behaviour. No wonder it got them upset.\n\nYTA", "You totally bombed that social interaction. Nobody is gonna remember your extremely precise take on a common concept (friendship), but they *will* remember how rude you were completely out of the blue. Your coworker is probably wondering what on earth they did wrong to make you so upset at them. Depressingly, the answer is nothing. You got so caught up in your own head you seem to have forgotten the other person, who was simply trying to let you know they appreciated you and would miss you. Now they think you hate them, but you just hate... inconsistent definitions, I guess?\n\nPerhaps being directly told someone insignificant to you likes and appreciates you made you uncomfortable and you lashed out. It's a bad look and you would do well to learn to control that behavior, if you want to be respected. Just smile and say thanks next time.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - who gives a shit? You are leaving the job. Just say, \"Thanks, I'll miss you too.\"", "YTA. All you had to do was keep your mouth shut and never talk to them again. You couldn't resist being the asshole.", "YTA and sound super petty and butthurt.\n\nAlso your definition of friend is flawed, but that's irrelevant I guess.", "To say that you're \"not a friend\" doesn't begin to cover it. \n\nDo you always burn every bridge into the ground before leaving a job? What was the purpose of saying such hurtful things to your colleague on your last day at the company? \n\nYTA. Big AH.", "NTA.  I use the same definition you do.  I find it so annoying when people at work talk about how we're all \"friends\" or, worse, \"Family\".  No. We're not.  I have friends and I have family. They aren't at my workplace.  I find it dishonest and yeah, it's annoying.   \n\nWould I have done what you did?  Probably not, but I also don't see a problem.  If someone wants to be classed as a friend, then they need to act like one.  If they choose not to, that's their choice.", "English needs to use word acquaintance more, this is typical to have stratification in my home country between friend and acquaintance and use appropriate word for right people,", "NTA for not considering her not a friend, but you could have just smiled and let it go. No reason really to tell her off, so that was a bit of a dick move.", "YTA", "Light YTA, OP do you think you might be autistic?", "YTA way to be mean to someone for no reason. Seriously, what would it have hurt you if you\u2019d just ignored that they kept calling you their friend?", "NTA. I think social media is somewhat to blame with this obsession with being everyone's friend. I have exactly the same mindset as you. If you don't hang out outside of work or have lengthy non-work related chats outside of work then you are just work colleagues, you're not friends.", "This is hilarious. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBut what exactly did you have to gain by pushing your definition?\n\nIf anything, I'd have let it slide. Because in my many years of working, I've somehow reconnected unexpectedly with old colleagues. Some who became critical in my professional growth. Some who became friends. \n\nLabels can be helpful for boundary setting. But you were about to leave. So at that point, why make such a stand?", "NTA. I have a similar definition of friends vs. coworkers or colleagues. Not every coworker I talk to on a regular basis is a friend. If we start doing things outside of work or start to talk about more personal things then a friendship starts to develop.\n\nI just moved and talked about it with my coworkers - technically something personal - I still wouldn't consider them friends at this point. It might become a friendship at some point, but not there yet. Maybe it is bc of the numerous bad experiences with so-called friends that I am just messed up - but friendship takes time to develop and takes a certain amount of trust and other things. Just because we talk during a break at work or during work doesn't mean we're friends.", "I'm torn because I agree with you on the distinction between friends and coworkers/colleagues.  But maybe it's not so cool to argue about it.  You're leaving your job.  Does it matter if Coworker calls you a friend if you're not going to see them again?\n\nNAH, but if this comes up again, maybe let it slide.  No need to argue semantics if you're not going to see them again.", "NAH. Friend can mean many different things, especially when people come from different cultures. And especially the phrase \"I don't consider us to be friends\" is often meant as hostile. Simple miscommunication by both of you. I'd say an apology and clarification is in order.", "YTA. If you\u2019re leaving the job anyway then you exposed yourself as a petty and spiteful person. Nod politely and go live the rest of your life. It sounds like you embarrassed yourself.", "YTA, and that was unnecessary. It sounds like you wanted to be friends and felt rejected, and I wonder if that\u2019s why you were so cruel about it.", "YTA, and if this was in front of other people, doubly so. \n\nINFO: are you on The Spectrum?", "YTA\n\nWhat difference does it make if that person considered you a friend, even if you did not?  It wasn't as if you were ever going to see that person again.  All you had to say was, \"I'm going to miss you too\" or \"It's been fun\" or \"I enjoyed working with you\".  Anything.  \n\nDo you tell people that you find unattractive \"Hey, ugly person!\" to their face?  Do you tell kids \"You know all that stuff they say about kids having unlimited potential?  It's trash.  You're a stupid kid and you're going to grow up to be a stupid adult.\"\n\nWhy do you feel the need to express every thought in your head?", "As most here have asserted, YTA. If you enjoyed their presence at work, as you stated, then that makes your relationship with your coworker to be (or have been, I guess) at the very least on friendly terms, hence it's not a stretch for them to consider you a friend and vice versa. You explicitly telling them otherwise basically means that you did not, or no longer consider such friendly/cordial relationship to exist. If you didn't mean that, you're a socially awkward idiot that needs some help with interpersonal communications. If you meant that, and it wasn't because they did something wrong but just a matter of semantics in your mind, then you're a humongous AH for saying that and ruining whatever positive relationship was present between you and them.", "YTA. You were cruel and petty for no reason.", "NTA she should have never tried to correct you \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "Sounds like bullshit, but YTA.", "Unpopular opinion but NTA.  For some reason it truly bothers me when someone believes we are friends but we aren't.  When I was in college I had a class with this one girl and did a performance project with her.  She started calling me every single day.  I wouldn't always call her back before she called me Again.  She eventually got upset and said I was making her feel like we were just \"school friends and not real friends\".  I had to say, \"we aren't friends, we are classmates.\"", "NTA - I also wouldn\u2019t consider them a friend. A \u201cwork friend\u201d is a coworker. If they are not hanging out with you outside of work, that is what they are. A friend is someone you can count on to be there, from the sounds of it, they were not. Also, them calling you an asshole for you being honest with them? It sounds like they are not able to handle the truth that they aren\u2019t a good \u201cfriend\u201d and need some self reflection.", "NTA - you shouldn't have to define what you consider a friend to another grown adult, but the fact that you took the time to explain that in the hopes that they'd take the information, process it, and then understand why what you said made sense and was accurate, rather than a painful jab at them, was good of you. not your fault your co-worker didn't \"get it\".\n\nthe fact that you attempted to facilitate a friendship by inviting them to engage outside of work, only to have them consistently decline, is another thing that sways my vote, here.\n\n\"*nobody you work with...is your friend\"* is something i was told before i'd even reached the age where i **could** work, and i've found as i've gotten older that it's very true.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
