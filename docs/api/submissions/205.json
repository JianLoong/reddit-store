The fact he still bothers you with his feelings, as if him dumping what he feels on you would make you suddenly more attracted to him? You should let him know about not being comfortable with his comments asap.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nIt's one thing to share his feelings, but once he got an answer he just refused it and he keep coming at you hoping you'll change your mind.\n\nHe's not \"sharing his feelings\" anymore. He did it once and you listened to him. Now he's actively ignoring your very clear answer and trying to force you to change it : He's not taking in consideration your opinion and he just try to brute force his way to you \n\nIf he and your friend can't understand why his behaviors is an issue, they're the problem not you", "NTA - You have not obligations to return his feelings or even reciprocate them. Just tell him it won't work out and if he can't accept that, then it's best to just no longer be friends. It would help his heart with this rejection.", "NTA. This has happened to me, and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s happening to you. In the end the only way he got the message was when I got myself a girlfriend (my being a lesbian didn\u2019t seem to deter him). \n\nHis emotional dumping is very unfair, because there\u2019s no reason for it other than maybe him hoping that you\u2019ll change your mind because he\u2019s sad (which would be very manipulative of him). Yes, he\u2019s sad, but you\u2019ve already told him no more than once \u2014 what is he hoping to get out of continuously telling you he\u2019s dreaming of you? \n\nTell him that he\u2019s making you deeply uncomfortable and if he still doesn\u2019t get it, give him some real distance.", "NTA. If he keeps dumping on you and making you uncomfortable? He's not your friend, and he never was. He was just as asshole with a crush.", "NTA. Totally fine to set that boundary.", "NTA. He shared his feelings freely. Why not do the same back?", "Honestly this is the type of stuff that ruins the friendship. He needs to stop and if he isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries then you should cut him off. You definitely need to tell him straight up that he needs to back off or there will be repercussions. It\u2019s weird and if you have no feelings towards him then that needs to be made very clear to him. He will just progress if you don\u2019t shut it down now.", "NTA! It's really unfair for him to dump his feelings on you. You've already made your feelings known to him. For him to continue doing it, saying he doesn't expect you to respond, AND saying he doesn't want to \"lose\" you.... That's a LOT for you to deal with and unfairly places you on your back foot because anything you say will hurt him, which you don't want to do, but you DO need to set some sort of boundary.\n\nI think you'll need to tell him a bit sterner that you don't reciprocate the feelings, and while you appreciate him as a friend, if he continues to do this, it will likely place an unintended strain on your friendship.", "NTA at all. Even if he's just very young and naive, he is absolutely being textbook creepy with the 'afraid to lose you' shit and he needs to be shut down.\n\nThe friends who say you don't have the right to tell someone to not share their feelings, as long as they are not being rude or explicit, are just wrong. You don't have to hang out with people whose behaviour makes you feel uncomfortable. Tell him, very very clearly, and if necessary in the presence of other people, that you have tried to be polite about it, he doesn't seem to have picked up on your signals, so now you are obliged to tell him \\*\\*very bluntly\\*\\* that you do not welcome him telling you about his feelings, and he needs to stop that right now. He's made it awkward for you. Don't be afraid to risk making it awkward for him.\n\nEdited to add: I speak from very similar experience btw. Speaking clearly and bluntly to the person about it was absolutely the best solution.", "NTA. This is straight up manipulation and toxic. Him repeating these feelings after you've told him you don't feel that way and then him saying he doesn't wanna lose you, is his way having you chained up to him. Your other friend some like a real work by saying your being unfair just cuz u won't cater to some a hole That Won't get the hint. Break it off with both of them. Save yourself the trouble.", "NTA - it\u2019s an uncomfortable situation when you already rejected him and he knows the feelings aren\u2019t mutual. He should be talking to his mates about it rather than dumping it on you. Kinda sounds like if he does it long enough you\u2019ll pity him and cave in for a date or something\u2026", "You absolutely do have a right to tell someone what they can and can't say to you. You can't sew his mouth shut, but you have your boundaries. He IS creeping you out. He's creeping ME out.\n\nYou say to him \"you for sure are gonna lose me if you don't reel it all the way in\"", "NTA, and your other friend is also a turd. Of course we have a right to have and express feelings, but not to unload them on to someone who obviously doesn't want to be their emotional dumpster. Friendships are also consensual. You're not his therapist and quite frankly, for both of your sakes, I would get some distance from your friend.", "I'll tell you what I figure I will one day have to tell my daughter. You have every right to firmly shut him down. It's hard to have feelings for someone who doesn't return them but that doesn't excuse emotionally dumping on them. Your friend's continued behaviour along this line is a breach of your boundaries and also of your trust as his friend. You have no obligation to his feelings here, certainly not when his behaviour is crossing a line. You have no obligation to put yourself through his harrassing behaviour just to nurse his ego. \nNTA", "NTA, if he's worried about \"losing\" you (he didn't have you to begin with) he wouldn't be emotionally dumping onto you. You likely will have to be direct with him about how he's making you feel, he should be talking to someone else about this instead of doing a sad puppy routine, especially after several months.", "NTA. He's entitled to obsess about you, but not to share that obsession with you. That's just creepy. In fact, that might be a workable script:\n\n\"Jim, you're entitled to obsess about me, but not to share that obsession with me. That's just creepy. Please stop.\"\n\nIf he persists, even once, do him the kindness of setting a concrete boundary:\n\n\"I've asked you to stop sharing this with me, and you haven't. Please stop messaging/emailing me \\[if applicable\\].\" Then block him, and in meatspace just avoid him, walking away if he wants to talk."]}
