The next decade is gonna suck until they realize you MEAN IT.", "NTA. They're not joking. They're sexist, ignorant and abusive and your life will be better once they're no longer in it. \n\nPlease go no contact and then consider therapy.

Show you know you deserve better and refuse to give in because you are better than that ill treatment.  Do it guilt free.  Your bf agreed with this because he actually cares.\n\nYour aunt cares too but her faith in humanity is too naive if she thinks that an immediate return to the lions den because they promised not to eat you this time is a good idea.
