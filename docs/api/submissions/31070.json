This makes me mad.\n\n   These parents need to learn that money cannot buy their entitled little darling a pass. They need to learn consequences.

Even if he honestly suspected your nephew he shouldn't have jumped the gun and made a public accusation. \n\nMaking a public retraction and apology is what he now needs to do to correct his own mistake. Nothing more, nothing less. He may cry about the damage to his own reputation, but it is deserved damage and comes as a direct result of his provable actions. His family even now aren't accepting full responsibility, placing the importance of your nephew's reputation below that of their son's even though their son is guilty of a wrongdoing and your nephew isn't.\n\nThere's no way the classmate's family should be able to buy their way out of admitting fault while your nephew stays labelled a thief in people's minds.", "NTA. What selfish parents. What about your nephews reputation? \n\nIf they think people will forget about this with your nephew, then the same logic can be applied to their son apologizing for making the false accusations. He\u2019ll be fine, just apologize. Trying to cover it up with a bribe just makes them look even more shitty.\n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think an assembly is necessary. If the accusations happened on social media, I think an apology on social media should likely suffice. But that might depend on how much damage these accusations did.", "NTA, you are a great job by standing up for your nephew.", "NTA. Classic case of FAFO and must be a kicker to the parents' when they realize there are some things money can't buy.", "Nta\n\nI doubt it will effect their life in the drastic way you think it will, but it'll make a lot less people trust then for a bit. (Them being the accuser) \n\nOr, take the $5k, and just tell everyone that he didn't steal it and the kid was lying. The $5k is so the kid doesn't need to confess, it's not buying your silence.
