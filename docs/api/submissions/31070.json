The important part publically is an acknowledgement that he's not a thief, not an acknowledgement of the other child spreading a lie.

The police would only care if he had filed a report with them saying his wallet was stolen and it was nephew that didn\u2019t. My guess is he didn\u2019t. With the school, you would basically need to show that the kid never had his wallet stolen or that he knew with absolute certainty it wasn\u2019t nephew before he accused him.
