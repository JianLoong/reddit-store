Even if he honestly suspected your nephew he shouldn't have jumped the gun and made a public accusation. \n\nMaking a public retraction and apology is what he now needs to do to correct his own mistake. Nothing more, nothing less. He may cry about the damage to his own reputation, but it is deserved damage and comes as a direct result of his provable actions. His family even now aren't accepting full responsibility, placing the importance of your nephew's reputation below that of their son's even though their son is guilty of a wrongdoing and your nephew isn't.\n\nThere's no way the classmate's family should be able to buy their way out of admitting fault while your nephew stays labelled a thief in people's minds.", "NTA. What selfish parents. What about your nephews reputation? \n\nIf they think people will forget about this with your nephew, then the same logic can be applied to their son apologizing for making the false accusations. He\u2019ll be fine, just apologize. Trying to cover it up with a bribe just makes them look even more shitty.\n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think an assembly is necessary. If the accusations happened on social media, I think an apology on social media should likely suffice.

How old is he and your nephew. \nIf you accept the money you\u2019ll enable their entitled attitude and that kid would probably bully your nephew again.

Universities and employers do goggle searches on people all the time and if the only thing that comes up is him being a theif it may cost him a job or Uni placement.

He\u2019s now an adult, his children call him bagdad.\n\nReputations stick. If they\u2019re concerned for their son\u2019s reputation, they should have raised him better. 5 grand is a shitload of money now, but when your nephew is an adult, what you\u2019re doing is going to be worth much more to him.\n\nPress it further, this is important to you, don\u2019t back down.", "If he isn't high profile it isn't thanks to them, publicising lies about him.

And by that I mean reporting to the appropriate authorities, engaging a lawyer to contact them and then, if that doesn\u2019t work, doing what he did and take to social media.  But I wouldn\u2019t stop at just saying that the boy had deliberately targeted your nephew when you have proof he wasn\u2019t even in school that day and refusing to post a retraction and apology, despite being given ample opportunity, but blasting his parents even louder, along the lines of how can the teenager be expected to make good, respectful choices when his parents think it\u2019s acceptable to attempt to buy people\u2019s silence.  Parenting is not about who can pay the biggest bribe and they are setting their son up for being a narcissistic adult who expects to buy his way through any situation.  I\u2019d also reference the high profile comment, to highlight how they think they are superior to others, along with the comments about not wanting to jeopardise his chances in the future when it\u2019s clear that his personality and behaviour are what should stop him getting those opportunities.  I\u2019d make it quite clear that morals, ethics and accountability are what makes good people, not lying, bribery and bullying tactics.", "NTA. \nAnd you chose the noble route. But as someone who did go to a clicky high school, I think it will blow over.  \n\nSo, maybe your nephew might like the 5,000$.

Cops, CPS, Ministry, report to each of them...\n\nGood luck.\n\nNTA, obviously..", "If they don't appologize everywhere, escalate AND PUT IT ON THE INTERNET TAGGING BOTH THE AH AND HIS PARENTS AND TELL ABOUT THE BRIBE", "Aww too bad."]}
