It's actually really healthy to give them names if it helps you). We chose not to give them the same names we would have given them, had they survived. We gave them names that we'd actually decided against using but we still found meaningful (my middle name that I share with several close cousins and two best friends, and the name he'd almost been given as a baby).\n\nMy babies didn't make it long enough to be properly named, though, before they died. Maybe if I'd referred to them by the names we'd chosen (we hadn't, as with the twins we hadn't gotten enough info to know their sexes yet), I wouldn't have changed them. But at that point, that would also have been another loss. Not only would I have lost the babies, but I'd have lost the little dream image of our future living children. \n\nOur decision was easier, in that way, but if you've never been in a position like that it's really, really hard to say what would make you feel better or worse.\n\nNow, the mother here has no right to be upset that other people want to use the name Theodore.

Cool.  Live and Let Live people.", "NTA. It honestly sounds like she used the name to try and keep it from everyone else.", "NTA\n\nDead baby doesn't get to claim a name forever.", "girl the way i was so confused because i thought all five of yall were gonna name your kid theodore,,, i was like??? at that point whats the problem then\nbut seeing as that isnt the case- nta.\ni think her calling your cousin awful names was extremely inappropriate and unnecessary.", "Nta you need to cut contact with your sister and all other family members whom are giving you hell. Why name your child after a man whom clearly was not important to you. Sadly her baby did not receive the name officially nor was it settle for him to be name that before he was born. Your sister just did that because she wanted pity and sympathy", "what the fuck?  i've never heard of someone changing someones name after they die.  that's weird.", "NTA. Many families reuse the same name from generation to generation, even amongst multiple family members. The fact it has special value to you makes this even more bizarre.\n\nETA:\n\nExamples I\u2019ve come across in my amateur genealogy, especially from southern US states (genetic last names):\n\n*Boys named after their father (example: John Wayne Smith; son is John Wayne Smith, Jr, but goes by Wayne; son is John Wayne Smith III, but is called Trey, a nickname for third.\n\n*A father is called Benjamin David Weber \n; son is Benjamin Bruce Weber, but is called Bruce; third son is Bruce Benjamin Weber, but called is Benjamin. This family had at least one other cousin with the same first name in the second generation. \n\n*My family were very devout Catholics in the past (importance on religion isn\u2019t a thing with my generation and I personally am agnostic) have many, many relatives, including brother and sisters, sharing \u201cJoseph\u201d or \u201cMarie\u201d as first or middle names.", "NTA.

She's a major AH", "NTA at all", "Hard NTA. \n\nOP your family is out of line. Why can't cousin say she named her baby after your sister's son AND Grandpa? To honour both?\n\nAlso, I feel it was really disrespectful to baby Dylan #1 to swap his name last minute and give it to a surviving sibling. Has anyone called her out on that?", "I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t get why you can\u2019t just make up a new totally different name from the child that passed away?   There are literally thousands of names to pick from.", "Yeah I\u2019m with you on that.", "She called her second child Dylan, according to OP comments", "This. I called it before I read it.

If they're all honoring the same person, then why does it matter if it's the same middle name? Personally, I would probably use *his* middle name or a related family name if it were me, but I don't see the big deal.", "Oh because after her baby died she changed his name from Dylan to Theodore and she is saying the cousin didn't respect her child's memory by using (\"stealing\" I think is how she sees it) the name", "That reminds me of My Big Fat Greek Wedding - Gus (the father) is introducing the future in laws to the family (which is aunts, uncles, cousins, 25-30 people), \"and here we have Nick, Anita, & Diane.

Going against the grain with this one. You're all setting rules for each other about how and when the rest of you can choose names for your children, and how others can choose to honor Theo, arguing and bullying each other for daring to choose the wrong name in the wrong way, and arguing about who has the most merit or right to a name. You are all acting terribly. Do you think Theo would approve of you all fighting each other just to use his name? Is this how you honor his memory?\n\nGo nuts on naming multiple children Theo to honor his memory, and just make sure that between you that there is a good shuffling of middle names so everyone knows what to call each other, and then perhaps all of you can leave each other alone and let each other pick the names of their own children.", "So every cousin could name their kid Theodore except for her??", "Nta", "Nope", "well put. I got chills reading that. She was \"saving\" the preferred name for a living child.", "You may suggests it but there is no need to do so.

I knew she wouldn't listen\n\nOh she DID listen. Seems like she just wanted a reason to throw a temper tantrum", "I hate to say it but your sister is an evil genius to say the least. Not only did she manage to keep the name she really wanted (Dylan) for a child that would actually be alive long enough to use it, but in her efforts to keep that name going, she essentially tried gatekeeping the name you and your family actually wanted to use. She\u2019s definitely a mental case and I\u2019m not sure there are people certified enough to handle that level of insane. NTA as far as my verdict, sorry the burden of shitty family. Been there done that, best you can do is distance yourself from her, if you\u2019re not gonna do that at least keep an eye out if she tortures cute and cuddly creatures\u2026", "NTA, but honestly it sounds like you have a pretty toxic family. Your parents abandoned you because you were gay and the four of your cousins were straight up raised by that man, and they think she honestly deserves to use that name more than any of you guys?? You might find peace if you cut off the rest and close your immediate family to just you and your cousins. \n\nUnless there\u2019s some other hidden reason why she chose to rename her son after someone she wasn\u2019t close to to the extent that *she didn\u2019t even attend his funeral*; I can only assume that she changed her angel baby\u2019s name to at least passively spite you all from using it. I have an angel baby of my own and if anyone even *suggested* changing her name so I could use her chosen one for my next child, I would\u2019ve lost my damn mind. Her name will always be hers, it was hers before she even got close to being earthside. To change it like that and reuse it.. That feels like a decision that needs to be talked about with a mental health professional. That does not sound like someone who has healed at all, just someone trying to erase the pain of the past by having another baby..", "Nobody owns names.", "NTA", "NTA Holy shit OP your sister is deranged, I can\u2019t even explain it. She didn\u2019t attend the grandpa\u2019s funeral proceeds to then name her son after said grandpa even though it wasn\u2019t the name she planed as soon as her son died? I mean that\u2019s just low. Then there\u2019s clearly attention seeking behavior, and then when someone who is ACTUALLY close to the grandpa, wants to name their child in actually loving memory of the grandpa That\u2019s when she starts to complain? You\u2019re right, She knew what was coming and clearly did what she did on purpose to try to be the center of attention.

But some wait till the naming ceremony. As far as I understand it, it largely depends on what the couple or their family practice. \n\nI believe there's something similar in other Hindu cultures as well.

She 100% did it to stop the others from being able to use the name, and if they did, she could throw a fit and cause problems.

It\u2019s hella childish to be attacking and guilting someone bc of the name of her INNOCENT child.
