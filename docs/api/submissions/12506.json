The fact that she named her next son Dylan just seems to say she changed her first son's name so that she could use the actual name she wanted to use on a child that actually lived which is actually kind of gross. It adds a lot of context the kind of person your sister is.", "And then used the deceased child's original name on her next child!", "The sister needs therapy asap", "It is relevant because it's family...
