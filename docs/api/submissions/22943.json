I paid off my mortgage in ten years that way.  \n\nIn 2020 right before the lockdowns my brother brought his new family to stay for a week. I didn't have any renters that week, we had talked well in advance. \n\nWhenever I have guests, not renters, staying with me I go in and out of my house as I please. This was an issue for my sister-in-law and her kids. They said I was not to come in without ringing the doorbell and being let in. I asked my brother WTF and he said that his wife and stepkids really liked their privacy. No problem. \n\nSo now the pandemic is in the rearview mirror and he asked if he could bring his family again. I said no. I said that I liked being able to use my property as I wanted and that if his family needed privacy there were literally hundreds of hotels in the area. \n\nHe said I was being a dick and punishing his family for their desire for privacy. I said they could come but that if they want exclusive use of my house they would have to rent it. My weekly rate is about $1,500. He said I was being ridiculous and that he could stay at a hotel for that much money. I said that's what he should do then. \n\nI got a call from our parents saying that I needed to stop being so petty and let him use the house. I told them that I would do so if in return my dogs and I could stay at his house since it is close to some really nice hikes my dogs would love. They said that my brother's wife would never agree to let someone stay in their house. I said that was a good policy so I would not be letting them stay with me. \n\nI got a message about a last minute rental for a few days during the week my brother wanted to come and I took it.  Now for sure he can't stay here.  \n\nMy parents and brother are pissed off with me for screwing up his vacation plans but I don't really care. \n\nI wasn't sure where to put this so I will just add that when I go into my house when I have guests I don't go into the bedrooms or anything.

Would OP be expected to actually PAY to go to a hotel while the guests stay for free?  Renting the place is a different situation, and such an expectation of privacy would be understandable.
