No problem. \n\nSo now the pandemic is in the rearview mirror and he asked if he could bring his family again. I said no. I said that I liked being able to use my property as I wanted and that if his family needed privacy there were literally hundreds of hotels in the area. \n\nHe said I was being a dick and punishing his family for their desire for privacy.
