I live with my dogs and we have plenty of room. \n\nI often let my friends and family stay with me. I work from home so I have my office in the guest house. I sometimes rent out my house and live in my guest house for months at a time. I paid off my mortgage in ten years that way.  \n\nIn 2020 right before the lockdowns my brother brought his new family to stay for a week. I didn't have any renters that week, we had talked well in advance. \n\nWhenever I have guests, not renters, staying with me I go in and out of my house as I please. This was an issue for my sister-in-law and her kids. They said I was not to come in without ringing the doorbell and being let in. I asked my brother WTF and he said that his wife and stepkids really liked their privacy. No problem. \n\nSo now the pandemic is in the rearview mirror and he asked if he could bring his family again. I said no. I said that I liked being able to use my property as I wanted and that if his family needed privacy there were literally hundreds of hotels in the area. \n\nHe said I was being a dick and punishing his family for their desire for privacy. I said they could come but that if they want exclusive use of my house they would have to rent it. My weekly rate is about $1,500. He said I was being ridiculous and that he could stay at a hotel for that much money. I said that's what he should do then. \n\nI got a call from our parents saying that I needed to stop being so petty and let him use the house. I told them that I would do so if in return my dogs and I could stay at his house since it is close to some really nice hikes my dogs would love. They said that my brother's wife would never agree to let someone stay in their house. I said that was a good policy so I would not be letting them stay with me. \n\nI got a message about a last minute rental for a few days during the week my brother wanted to come and I took it.  Now for sure he can't stay here.  \n\nMy parents and brother are pissed off with me for screwing up his vacation plans but I don't really care. \n\nI wasn't sure where to put this so I will just add that when I go into my house when I have guests I don't go into the bedrooms or anything. I go to the kitchen or freezer or laundry room. That's it.

Lol, that's rich. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous that your family expects you to allow him to use your house but is ok with him not allowing you in his.", "Wow! Definitely NTA. In fact, quite the opposite. Your kindness to your brother and his family by letting them have the use of your house rent-free was generous. The nerve of your SIL refusing to let you use your home during their visit is simply outrageous. You are not the one who ruined their vacation plans. Their behavior did that and now they don\u2019t like the consequences. Too bad, so sad. Your parents siding with them is the icing on the cake. I\u2019d go no-contact with your family until they all settle down. Enjoy your peaceful summer, OP.", "Definitely NTA, but your SIL is. As is the rest of your family by association for agreeing with her and her ridiculous delusions.", "NTA\n\n1) Its your house.... Is there really a need for any other reasons?\n\nThey took advantage of your kindness the first time and you were understanding probably because it preserved family peace and communications may not have been perfectly clear then.  You learned your lesson and refused to allow them to use your house the next time and instead of accept your (THE OWNER\"S) decision and his response was to cry to mommy and daddy about it????  Your counter offer was fair as an exchange, they stay with privacy, but you get to stay at their place with your dogs.  They refused.  They had every right to refuse and you had every right to continue using your income generating property as you wish.", "NTA\n\nIf your brother\u2019s family lived in your house for free, and set their own rules, that\u2019s reasonable, why you wouldn\u2019t want them staying in your house anymore.

He doesn't get to dictate your behavior.", "Your whole family sounds entitled. Why is your brother the golden child with your parents? Why does his wife get to decide people could never stay at their house but you should willingly share yours? Good job standing your ground. NTA. Show them the comments here.", "If I am reading this correctly.... its YOUR house. You can have whomever come or not through your property. If he wants a hotel like experience, than he needs to rent a hotel. Cant have it both ways.", "NTA. Guest shouldn't treat their hosts as guests. SIL wants privacy, she can stay in her own room. I would be very suspicious of people who wanted me to be let in to my own home. Did you count the silverware after she left?", "Your house, your rules, right?\n\nThis may have been edited to keep your post a readable length, but was the \u201cyou should do this\u201d argument going on when you accepted the new renter?  Did the family think this was still up for discussion when you accepted the new folks?\n\nNTA either way, just wondering if you\u2019re going to hear from your parents that you pulled the rug out after plane tickets were purchased.", "NTA. Guests are allowed for privacy in their rooms but that's it. Also not letting you stay at their place if you have your dogs is just the icing on the cake.", "NTA. You are completely right in this situation. Your SIL is a very cheeky woman. And I don't understand your parents' position. Is your brother a favourite child in your family?", "NTA", "NTA, \n\nYou brother, his wife and your parent are TA.\n\nYou are doing them a huge favor by letting for free.\nHowever, they cannot be grateful and want more. \nWhile also bot providing you with the same type of favor, letting you and your dogs stay at her place.\n\n\nYour parents are TA for putting your brothers issues on you, even though you were generous. \n\nIs your brother the golden child?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're allowed to vacation how they want to, but you're allowed to use your property how you want as well. Sounds like you're at an impasse and they should book other accommodations.
