Possibly self sabotaging? It's so terribly disrespectful to G. \n\nLot to unpack here. I think you would not be the asshole for telling him, because I would want to know if my partner felt this way. But there could be a lot of collateral damage with your friendships. I mean the outcomes are:\n1) they work through it but gf will hate you and your couple friend group will be a nightmare if it doesn't fall apart\n2) they break up and you have to deal with the fallout, your friendship with the gf is ruined and husband may be less happy with you having a single best friend\n3) gf denies saying this, G believes her, friendship with G and gf is ruined \n\nI really do feel for you. She put you in a terrible position saying that. I'd sleep on it for a couple nights. Wouldn't blame you for not saying anything as it's not entirely your place, but if you feel it's the right thing to do you should.", "I\u2019m in the minority but NTA. What a weird thing to say to a person you know is your partner\u2019s best friend. I\u2019m genuinely baffled by her thought process here. If I was your friend, I\u2019d want to know my partner was saying something like that.", "Your loyalty is first and foremost with your best friend. You could encourage the girlfriend to express her feelings to your friend, but if she doesn't then you have to warn him. Some people are talking about interference and the gf's trust in you, but I don't think it applies here. She interfered with YOUR friendship by telling you something very innapropriate. If you keep it to yourself (if she does not tell him) then when he'll learn about it (100% gonna happen) and feel betrayed by you.", "NTA, he deserves to know that his girlfriend is just cashing in, she\u2019ll 100% leave when someone she deems better comes along.", "NTA\n\nIt's weird for her to say that to you, aka her BF's best friend.\n\nIf I was your friend, I\u2019d want to know my partner was saying something like that.\n\nPeople here have said \"it's none of your business\", but she LITERALLY told you about this, which makes it your business. She didn't have to tell you.", "Everyone will have an opinion on this, but knowing if you\u2019d be TAH for telling is entirely dependent on the person you are telling.  Unfortunately you won\u2019t know unless you tell him. This is an extremely difficult situation. Perhaps just ask him if he\u2019s happy and let that guide you. You could also consider talking with the gf and recommending she share her feelings openly with G. Good luck. I don\u2019t envy the position you are in.", "NTA. And it looks like I'm in the minority here. I kind of feel the same way you do though, I'd want to know if someone had just settled for me, that could be the difference between me being happy in the long run and stop me from going through a divorce later on if I asked her to marry me then ever found out. To be honest though, if you do say anything, you may lose both of them as friends.", "NTA, please tell him", "Don't do it it's a trap!\n\nHonestly I see your point but this will literally only blow up in your face, no good will come out of it!", "You would be the AH.  Don't butt into someone else's relationship like that.  Heck, there's a reasonable chance that your \"best friend\" may not be friends with you at all afterward.  If everyone waited for their \"soulmate\" and didn't settle on some level, just about everyone would be single.", "YWBTA. Do not violate someone's trust unless someone else is in imminent danger. Your friend will realize it on his own if he hadn't already. Maybe he feels like comfort and familiarity are enough for him too.", "YWBTA if you tell him. It's not your business, and for all you know she was just expressing a passing feeling. People have moods, including about how much they may love someone else.  People have mid-relationship crises that may not last. So don't detonate a \"bomb\" that would probably destroy your friendship with the guy you consider a best friend, as well as the lady.  Let events take their course and let them work it out.", "Ywbta. Do not get involved in another\u2019s relationship. \nIf you do decide to tell him..be prepared to lose friends. The messenger gets shot. He\u2019s gonna choose his GF over you. He\u2019s been choosing her everyday for almost 5 years. You\u2019ll lose him when he chooses her, and her by default bc they\u2019re a team. \nYou\u2019ll lose her as a friend her breaking her confidence. Of course, you\u2019ll lose him as default bc they\u2019re a team.\n\nBesides, chances are he already feels it. Yet he\u2019s still choosing her. If he isn\u2019t coming to you talking about his relationship..chances are he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it with you. \n\nYou decide\u2026is getting this off your mind by telling him worth losing them as friends?", "YWBTA\n\nIt's literally not your place to reveal that and even if you're friends with him she told you that in private. You say that if roles were reversed you'd like to know, but have you considered that if you were her telling someone something personal that you wouldn't want them telling?", "YWBTA - she told you in confidence, keep it. People can say things they don\u2019t necessarily mean in the moment or when they are at a low point. She isn\u2019t cheating, she may feel differently next week and regret telling you.  This is deeply personal between her and hubs and needs to stay that way", "YTA\n\nWhat can I even say, I would not keep such secret from dear friend of mine. It is in my eyes complete betrayal of friendship. I would also think less for his gf. I guess he really can't count on you.", "YWBTA talk with their girlfriend first, ask her why she would tell you this and if she told your friend yet etc. assess the situation before moving rashly", "YWBTA\n\nSomeone confided in you and you\u2019re debating on breaking their trust? If the relationship is coming to an end, then let it. It\u2019s none of your business.", "Absolutely. YWBTA.\n\nThat is not your relationship to comment, interfere, or intervene in.  You can give your friend whatever advice she wants, as a friend. If she asks for it. \n\n But for you to go tell him that? absolutely not your place. As far as you know he may have settled for her as well.  \n\nYou don't really know the full of context of her comment. They may be going through a rough patch, she may not have actually meant to say it the way it came across. You would be stirring the pot and starting trouble where there isn't any. Not your relationship, not for you to comment on.", "YWBTA\n\nWe don't live in a fairytale . Most people aren't lucky enough to date their first choice, or their second choice. A lot of people need to settle for someone they're not particularly attracted to. That's just the way the world works.", "YWBTA 100%. Keep your nose out of other people's relationships unless it's something illegal or endangering to their life. This isn't either of those things. Your husband is correct.", "YWBTA. I do not think it would be particularly kind of you to give that information in the *exact* form it was relayed to you, nor do I see what the gain would be. Such confessions are usually said in confidence. While I think you should do *something* about it to look after your best friend's interests, I do not think breaking it by telling him what the confession was is the correct thing to do. It would cause a lot of drama and trouble, especially if his wife denies it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe it\u2019s so nonchalant because it\u2019s so well known. But my best friend has never given me these vibes. And my husband, who is also friends with him, hates that I told him. Because it\u2019s such a horrible thing to just know.", "Exactly. Which is why my husband said it was a test. Idk honeslty.", "YES.", "Especially since we aren\u2019t genuine friends. I talk to her only when it involves my friend. We\u2019ve gone out to dinner together (all of us). Maybe my best friend already knows. Maybe I\u2019m just being clued in on their relationship?", "That\u2019s what my husband said. It\u2019s a trap. But seemed so sincere and casual about it. That\u2019s what made me think he already knew.", "AND people get back together and mend relationships- atp OP would be on the outside.", "You\u2019re right. It was really her casualness that caught me off guard so much. She said it like it was normal relationship dynamic. She said later that night that women\u2019s feelings are more important than men\u2019s. \u201cHave you tried crying?\u201d To get what I want. She just views things way differently than I do.", "Her and I aren\u2019t friends. Just acquaintances through him. Which is why I was so shocked she told me. I don\u2019t even have her phone number.", "The thing is we aren\u2019t close at all. I don\u2019t even have her phone number. Which is why I was so caught off guard.", "It\u2019s hard. Because we\u2019re not friends. Just acquaintances. She let me stay with them when I had a rough time. We were at a restaurant and she told me this while he was in the restroom. It was so jarring and unexpected.", "She said it so casually. Like maybe he already knows. I\u2019m not her friend. We\u2019re just acquaintances. She was so nice to let me stay with her (them) a few days. But I was just so jarred when she told me that.", "Right. I\u2019ve decided I won\u2019t tell him. But it was the casualness that caught me off guard. And we are not friends. We\u2019re just acquaintances through him. I don\u2019t even have her phone number. It was just weird for her to tell me this.", "Honestly that\u2019s how she put it. That she was settling for what was \u201cokay\u201d.  It was just upsetting to hear. I, of course, want nothing but the best for my friend. I\u2019ve said this multiple times, but maybe he knows and maybe he feels the same way. He gripes about her often. I thought it was normal griping, though.", "You wouldn\u2019t tell a person if they were cheating? Because that\u2019s not illegal or \u201cendangering to their life\u201d.", "So maybe ask how is relationship is? Kinda get info out of him first? See if that info is even needed? Maybe they\u2019re mutually settling?", "What\u2019s wrong with having a male best friend as a women? My husband is also friends with him.", "I saw you responded to others  that you are not even friends with this girl at all which brings me back to self sabotage. If I was so possessed to do this with one of my partners close friends, I would expect them to tell her. It's just an insane thing to do. Maybe try bringing this comment up with the gf again in person and see if she is consistent in her derision of G. \n\nMany people are telling you it is not your place to \"meddle\" in their relationship. Well, maybe they're right - it's certainly not In your best interest. But this girl just word vomited a confession at you that has implications for your friends whole life. You can run into a burning building to try and save someone even though you're not a fireman. Unless you have some indication from G that he is aware and/or comfortable with this type of relationship with gf he deserves to know before they get married or take further steps as a couple.", "You don\u2019t \u201ctest\u201d the people you care about unless you\u2019re a fucked up person. Even if she is, losing her would not be a loss.", "She easily could've vented to \\*her\\* friends, since they are further away from your best friend. But you are very close to her BF.\n\nI would ask your friend about his relationship and see how things are. I would also tell him what his GF said. Even though she didn't outright say she wants you to be involved in their relationship, this kinda seems like a cry for hep on her end.", "Tell him what she said, why it was so weird, and that you know she had to have expected you to say something to him, which is why you think it could be a trap. Tell him you had to think long and hard about telling him, which is why it took so long, but that however his gf meant what she said, he had a right to know. \n\nIf you acknowledge that the gf might be using you to try to start shit, and that you don't really want to be in this position of knowing what she said, this will keep it from looking like you're just starting shit all on your own.\n\nRemember, your friend knows who you are, and that starting shit isn't your style. He also knows who his gf is, and will likely be able to answer the question for himself as to whether his gf actually just settled for him and unwisely shared that with you in a mouth-running moment, or if she is the type to try to use you for some nefarious plan.", "No doubt.", "Tell your friend about this, too!", "Her aside, is this worth your friendship with him. \nIf it\u2019s worth it to you then\u2026.", "In my mind, she can\u2019t expect this to be secret in this situation.  You have a much closer relationship to the other person.  She knows this.  \n\nDid she swear you to secrecy or something first?  Did you pressure her to tell you?  Then that might be different.\n\nOtherwise, your loyalty should be to your friend.  It was asshole of her to put you in this position in the first place.\n\nI wonder if this isn\u2019t at least part of her wanting the relationship to break down, maybe without her having to initiate the breakup.  She\u2019s settling and there\u2019s no spark - that\u2019s pretty bleak.", "Doesn\u2019t change a thing YWBTA if you told him", "oof that\u2019s a tough situation :/ just do what you think is right then, dude\n\ngood luck", "nah lol you are not being a bro if you don't tell him this person is smoking crack", "It could have very well been small talk. \n\nI had a coworker years ago tell me that her marriage was out of convenience. We were not like close friends or anything. She had a 3-year old son and would openly talk at work about how she continued her relationship with her high school boyfriend out of convenience.  Then they went on to the same college, the same major, so they just continued to be together.  People will say odd things that may seem odd, but it could be their way of trying to make conversation. It may very well had been a joke that didn't land.", "It depends but probably not most times, no. If I knew they were cheating, I'd tell them to come clean before they're caught, I'd inform whoever the other partner was that the other person was in a prior relationship and hope that that'd make the other person split but my general stance is to not get involved in other people's business.", "[deleted]", "He thinks it\u2019s a test because I\u2019m a woman and my best friend is a male. It\u2019s a test to see if I would try and ruin their relationship.", "Honestly, I wanted to say it on the car ride back (it was just me and him in the car, as she had taken her own), but I held back. God, it\u2019s such a horrible thing to put on someone. I didn\u2019t ask for this or coerce this info from her. She just handed it out like it was normal.", "My friendship with him is worth more than this. I\u2019d do anything for him. But idk if this qualifies as \u201cdoing anything for him\u201d. He deserves a girl that wants him and isn\u2019t \u201csettling\u201d. But again, maybe he knows. Maybe he doesn\u2019t care. Maybe I should ask questions to get a feeling first?", "I didn\u2019t pressure her at all. She just let it out. As soon as he went to the bathroom. \nShe also didn\u2019t swear me to secrecy. Which makes me feel like it\u2019s not a secret. Like maybe he already knows. Again, maybe he is good with it. Maybe he\u2019s settling too?", "I get that. But G and I have both been best friends for a few years. It\u2019s not something you slip to a best friend? Like I\u2019m supposed to just keep this hidden. Or maybe he already knows. Maybe he doesn\u2019t care. Maybe it\u2019s mutual. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not friends with her, she shouldn\u2019t have said it to me if it wasn\u2019t an obvious thing. (I can\u2019t think of a better word rn)", "If your best friends partner, who you aren't even friends with, voluntarily admitted to cheating on them and you didn't tell them... YWBTA! Your loyalty is to your best friend.", "My husband is obviously my best friend. Outside of my relationship, G is my best friend. He told me he thinks of her as his favorite person and me as his best friend.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think that she told you as a test. I think IT\u2019S A TRAP. Especially when I saw your other comment that said she told you this in person when he got up to use the restroom. She told you in person so that there would be no evidence to prove that she actually said any of this.\n\nDefinitely a trap, DO NOT FALL FOR THIS. If you tell your friend she\u2019ll just deny it and turn it around on you: \u201cshe\u2019s lying, she just wants to break us up, she\u2019s toxic, don\u2019t talk to her anymore\u201d. \n\nIt sounds like she doesn\u2019t like that you and him are such good friends so she\u2019s cooked up this scheme in order to get you out of the picture. I\u2019d ignore her for now, but the next time you\u2019re around her and the two of you are alone you should SECRETLY RECORD THE CONVO. She may very well try it again\u2014but this time you\u2019ll have evidence.", "I think that's correct. She's trying to prove you untrustworthy, and he should not be your friend. UWBTA If you fell for it.", "What does it have to do with your genders though? I don't understand. I'd probably straight up ask his girlfriend why would she talk to me about their relationship like that.", "Hence the \"it depends.\"", "This is what my husband is thinking.", "I\u2019m not a confrontational person. I just go along with what most people say. It\u2019s gotten me in a lot of messes. I\u2019m working on it. Not an overnight thing. But I was again absolutely caught off guard with what she said. It was out of the blue and sooooo casual.", "Then the way to defuse the trap is to tell your friend what she said, *and that you think it might be a trap!* (And describe the possible trap to him, bc he won't necessarily get there on his own.)\n\nIf you care about your friend, you *must* tell him, because he's either with a woman who thinks he's second-rate, or he's with a woman who is nasty, jealous, and manipulative. Or, just maybe, both.", "You could also just send him this post. And if he doesn\u2019t believe you then idk how good of a friend he actually was."]}
