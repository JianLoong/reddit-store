I have no doubt that when it actually does happen you will feel but just the \u2018threat\u2019 of it (yet again) has been emotionally dealt with by you so many times that it doesn\u2019t have any effect.

Making people isn\u2019t hard.

She wasn\u2019t the one who did that for you. \n\nAlso having a new affliction every time you turn around is actually a symptom of bipolar, HOWEVER, being bipolar doesn\u2019t preclude her from ALSO being a narcissist.

Could be lying about everything or exacerbating. But on a more serious note, don't feel bad for not wanting to get invested or care anymore than you have to. You're not being cold or AH, your defense mechanisms have been activated to prevent any further pain and suffering.  Don't ever feel bad for feeling how you feel when it comes to your mom.", "NTA. You're the child, they are the adult. Given the history, this is simply the consequence of their decisions (albeit I understand addiction is very hard).

You might consider getting her a copy for a get well soon gift\\~", "NTA. People who have to live with those like your mom have to detach emotionally or be destroyed. I have a sister who thinks she is dying every other week, and though she does have health issues, she always exaggerates for attention. Munchausen syndrome. I detached long ago for my own mental wellbeing. She was so excited when she found out I have a genetic disorder and immediately ran out and got tested herself (we are half siblings) and she is indeed a carrier, but doesn't have the full blown disease. She touted that around as long as she possibly could. Way longer than I talked about it and it will kill me one day.", "A lot of addicts are compulsive liars, as you've most likely seen throughout your life. Do you feel guilty for what you'd said? If you do, I'm telling you not to. She had you, and neglected you, had you removed from her care, you're lucky you had a relative or else you most likely would have ended up in the system like so many other kids of addicts. \n\nShe caused you trauma, I'm assuming she's still an addict now? Proving even losing custody of her child was not enough to make her stop using. I'd still tread carefully. This could be another lie to try and gain sympathy or manipulate you further.\n\nNTA, it's OK to cut toxic people out of your life, including the incubator that brought you into the world.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry your mom has treated you this way. She clearly hasn't been a parent to you and you don't owe her anything. It sounds like she wanted to make you feel bad and question your actions to manipulate you. IMO she is trying to make you prove that you love her despite her treatment of you. It sucks.", "Found the mother.", "NTA. She cried wolf, now you can\u2019t know what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t. Also, if you treat your body like crap with drugs and or alcohol, then it\u2019s not surprising to end up with some kind of damage. You\u2019re not her caretaker, so it\u2019s not your job to support the woman who failed at taking care of you properly", "r/raisedbynarcissists is the sub for you. Also very much NTA. People say you only have one mother, but they can never imagine the amount of mental damage that one person can cause...", "NTA. How could you be when this woman has lied to you and jerked you around your whole life?\n\nSo glad you had your grandmother there.", "NTA. Lying about your illnesses is pretty serious and can break someone's trust over time, which is what's happening with you. Also, your mom doesn't sound like a healthy parent. Just because they're related to you doesn't mean you have to love them or care about them if they've done things to damage your relationship permanently. If she ever asks to live with you then you'll need to put your foot down so that she stays out of your life.", "NTA. The fun part is that now you\u2019re 18 you don\u2019t have to deal with this if you don\u2019t want. Feel free to block her if she gets to be too much.", "NTA,\n\nYou\u2019re 18 years old so even if she was allowed full contact with you as a child, you are now an adult so if you don\u2019t want contact from her you are well within your rights to set that boundary and enforce it.", "NTA. Your mom is a narcissist and you just performed her kryptonite, passivism. They're looking for the big reaction to validate their toxic self-absorbtion.", "NTA if you want your kids to love you, be a parent deserving of love.", "absolutely NTA!  with the history you have with her, your reaction to this \"news\" is normal, in my opinion.  you have no reason to feel any different than you do.  she hasn't given you any reason to feel different.", "Yes.

She lied to other members of my family about me leading to me being alone at 17 years old. When she died in 2017 I did not go to the funeral and I am fine with that decision. People called me an AH but sometimes you have to look out for yourself. You have been perfectly civil with her and I think that says a lot of good about you. Be strong OP nobody can tell you how to feel.", "When my mother passed away, my father made such a horrible comment to me about it.  (They split when I was 2).  It took all my willpower not to punch his lights out in a busy pub.  I'm sure everyone in the pub would have been understanding when I explained why I did, after repeating what he said.  But instead, I simply bought him a pint, and walked out the door.   \n\n\nI never spoke to him again, until one day a few years later, when my aunt told me he was in a hospice with lung cancer.  I phoned him up, to placate them.   \n\n\nWhen I spoke to him, all I could remember was what he said, and how karma had come back to haunt him.   \n\nHe wasn't a very good father anyway.  Do I feel guilt, absolutely not.  His comment was the last straw.  People only get so many chances in life, and once they cross a certain threshold, shit is on them.  \n\nNever feel guilt for other people being twats.", "NTA.

Sounds exhausting.", "NTA", "NTA but tell her bluntly \"Yeah after everything you've put me through I don't really know if I love you anymore.\"\"", "Nta, expected after reading addict. Reading whole confirmed it.\n\nIf you're concerned about her then send her to therapy or something", "NTA.

You don\u2019t owe your compassion to someone who, as you said, made your life hell. My mother did the same to me. When she died I felt absolutely nothing. And it bothered me so much that I went to therapy, wondering what happened to me since I literally cry over pet videos and sentimental commercials. But I couldn\u2019t shed even one tear when it came to my mother. I was in therapy for two weeks, when the therapist looked at me and said there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Why would you miss someone or cry for someone who treated you so badly? I have never looked back since.", "YTA", "NTA.
