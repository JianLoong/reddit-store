She's put you in a position where you can't allow yourself to care, because she weaponizes it against you.", "NTA. I'm sorry you were landed with such a shit parent. She has no right to expect any compassion from you. It's not about holding grudges, this is just the consequence of her actions. Do, however, think carefully about how you'll feel if she is seriously ill - don't leave yourself with regrets. And contact should be your choice.", "NTA. You're not holding a grudge, she's just never apologized, showed remorse, or even asked if you like her. I doubt you do.", "NAH\n\nShe cried wolf too many times and even those there\u2019s proof, you\u2019re emotionally spent from times nothing happened.

It sounds like she is a total attention seeker and wants all the attention on her. The problem with narcissists is they do really awful things like this just because they can.

You may benefit from some therapy too; this stuff is traumatic.", "NTA. You honestly dealt with that perfectly. Narcissists are best dealt with the \"gray rock\" method, meaning you give no reaction.
