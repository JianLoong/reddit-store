She's put you in a position where you can't allow yourself to care, because she weaponizes it against you.", "NTA. I'm sorry you were landed with such a shit parent. She has no right to expect any compassion from you. It's not about holding grudges, this is just the consequence of her actions. Do, however, think carefully about how you'll feel if she is seriously ill - don't leave yourself with regrets. And contact should be your choice.", "NTA. You're not holding a grudge, she's just never apologized, showed remorse, or even asked if you like her. I doubt you do.", "NAH\n\nShe cried wolf too many times and even those there\u2019s proof, you\u2019re emotionally spent from times nothing happened.

I could have been kinder though.", "Yeah you are", "NTA. I am so sad reading this \ud83d\ude1e. Don't let your mother manipulate you into feeling guilty! It sounds like she is a total attention seeker and wants all the attention on her. The problem with narcissists is they do really awful things like this just because they can. You sound like such a nice person and at 18 you really have a good grasp of life. Live your best life and to hell with your mum, she doesn't deserve your love x", "NTA\n\nThe cherry on top was the \u201crant about how no one loves her\u201d. Classic manipulation. It sounds like she needs some serious mental health care, but you are not responsible for that. She was supposed to take care of you, not the other way around. You may benefit from some therapy too; this stuff is traumatic.", "NTA. You honestly dealt with that perfectly. Narcissists are best dealt with the \"gray rock\" method, meaning you give no reaction. Good on you OP", "NTA. She honestly had it coming to her. It's really sad to hear about stuff like this.", "NTA It's like the boy who cried wolf. When the wolf really came, no one believed him. She has brought this on herself. You can't help that she uses and abuses situation and people.", "was coming here to say this.", "Nope. NTA.\n\nJust because someone is family it doesn't entitle them to treat you like shit but still receive the benefits of being a family member back from you.\n\nIf she wants you to feel sympathy for her as your mother then she should have been your damn mother.", "NTA\n\nI think your mom is a total AH though. After lying to her kid about stupid BS so many times, she deserves none your lies of sympathy. You're a great person for trying to show that you\"care\", but you hold all the grudges you want.", "NTA.  \n\nCancer survivor here.  Using cancer like this is really shitty.  \n\nHer story is really suspect as well.  A mass in the stomach would cause black stool from *digested* blood.

You said what you had to.", "NTA. \" I already spent all of my grief on that brain tumor you had, mom. I hope you feel better soon!\"  \n  This is flip and shitty though. You have given everything and have gotten nothing in this relationship, which is truly the opposite of what a mother/child relationship should be.

My mom\u2019s mom is also a manipulative, addicted, cry-wolf, abusive lady just like your mom and it tore my mom apart trying to placate her. She eventually had to go no contact fully and has started to be able to heal a bit as a result.\n\nThis is all to say you owe her nothing. Protect your own peace of mind; if she wanted sympathy and emotional labor from you she should\u2019ve earned it.", "NTA. She put herself in this situation and now she\u2019s gaslighting you. You have no reason to feel guilty. There\u2019s a difference between mother and Mom. She\u2019s your mother as in you came from her ovum and she gave birth to you. She\u2019s not your Mom. She didn\u2019t raise you, care for you, protect you, teach you etc. You owe her nothing.", "NTA", "It\u2019s not cold, your brain has mentally checked out of allowing you to care or even really take it seriously for self preservation. It\u2019s happened so many times before and knowing her addictions your brain has prepared you for her death repeatedly from a young age to try to help you avoid the trauma over and over again. I have no doubt that when it actually does happen you will feel but just the \u2018threat\u2019 of it (yet again) has been emotionally dealt with by you so many times that it doesn\u2019t have any effect. She only has herself to blame. You are definitely NTA.", "Nta. \nToxic people are still toxic even if their family.", "NTA. I hope you find peace and happiness in your life, despite your mother.", "NTA from the child of an alcoholic, at some point you have to distance yourself and your emotions for your own sanity. And you being a sane rational person realise that they are killing them selves it\u2019s only a matter of time, so you have already processed this eventuality and you no longer have emotions attached to it. Every thing you said and your reaction is perfectly normal.", "NTA: I have a friend who\u2019s mother was just the same+ married a man and they get into physical fights my friend has gotten very hurt in more than a few trying to stop it. She would feel the same as you do right now.", "This. As a recovered addict myself, walk away from her. Do not answer her calls.

Hell you don\u2019t even owe them contact. Telling you that you are in the wrong for holding a grudge is a form of denial about her continued behavior.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her anything.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to give your mom the time of day. It\u2019s up to you who you have in your life, blood or not. Blood and water are the same thickness. BTW I think she meant BPD which sad, BPD sucks but not an excuse for lies, manipulation or narcissistic behavior.", "all i can say is i\u2019m lucky to have my mom, NTA btw", "NTA. I would be so sick of this as well.", "NTA - just tell her that you are looking on the bright side since she already survived a brain tumour.", "NTA, but it will be much easier if you speak to the doctor about her bipolar diagnosis. Because they usually need meds.", "NTA\n\nShe's possibly pulling another narcissist stunt. I'm afraid she deserves to die if otherwise.", "She gave you life and nothing more. Making people isn\u2019t hard. Raising good, well-rounded, functioning people is somewhat common sense but it\u2019s also a huge time commitment and you\u2019ve got to do some stuff like care about them and avoid drugs. She wasn\u2019t the one who did that for you. \n\nAlso having a new affliction every time you turn around is actually a symptom of bipolar, HOWEVER, being bipolar doesn\u2019t preclude her from ALSO being a narcissist. Whatever she is, it sounds like you\u2019re better off if she does that all away from you. \n\nYou are NTA. Best wishes to your mom and her ass bleeds, if she does in fact have them; and best wishes to you and kudos for reinforcing your boundaries, your autonomy, and for keeping someone from draining you unnecessarily. \n\nKeep doing that OP. It\u2019s ok to have a hard line when it comes to your mom.", "NTA - I go through this with my mother year after year. Well, went. I don\u2019t talk to her now and I\u2019m fine with that.", "The detached sympathy you feel for her is more than generous.", "If she's anything like my narcissistic father, the \"heavy rectal bleeding\" is a little bit of blood, probably from hemorrhoids.  Could be lying about everything or exacerbating. But on a more serious note, don't feel bad for not wanting to get invested or care anymore than you have to. You're not being cold or AH, your defense mechanisms have been activated to prevent any further pain and suffering.  Don't ever feel bad for feeling how you feel when it comes to your mom.", "NTA. You're the child, they are the adult. Given the history, this is simply the consequence of their decisions (albeit I understand addiction is very hard). Your reaction is to be expected in these circumstances.", "NTA\n\nThere's a very prominent and well known cautionary fairytale about a boy who told lies until nobody believed him when he needed them to. You might consider getting her a copy for a get well soon gift\\~", "NTA. People who have to live with those like your mom have to detach emotionally or be destroyed. I have a sister who thinks she is dying every other week, and though she does have health issues, she always exaggerates for attention. Munchausen syndrome. I detached long ago for my own mental wellbeing. She was so excited when she found out I have a genetic disorder and immediately ran out and got tested herself (we are half siblings) and she is indeed a carrier, but doesn't have the full blown disease. She touted that around as long as she possibly could. Way longer than I talked about it and it will kill me one day.", "A lot of addicts are compulsive liars, as you've most likely seen throughout your life. Do you feel guilty for what you'd said? If you do, I'm telling you not to. She had you, and neglected you, had you removed from her care, you're lucky you had a relative or else you most likely would have ended up in the system like so many other kids of addicts. \n\nShe caused you trauma, I'm assuming she's still an addict now? Proving even losing custody of her child was not enough to make her stop using. I'd still tread carefully. This could be another lie to try and gain sympathy or manipulate you further.\n\nNTA, it's OK to cut toxic people out of your life, including the incubator that brought you into the world.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry your mom has treated you this way. She clearly hasn't been a parent to you and you don't owe her anything. It sounds like she wanted to make you feel bad and question your actions to manipulate you. IMO she is trying to make you prove that you love her despite her treatment of you. It sucks.", "Found the mother."]}
