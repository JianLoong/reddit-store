SHE didn\u2019t lose out on anything and the family is right to treat you that way because now they are seeing who you REALLY are as a person and they don\u2019t like what they see.

Sure, people may see it and ask about it, but most will probably have no use for a mural and therefore wouldn't seek your niece out. Meaning... I agree with her that you and her are on different pages in regards to what the exposure would bring for her.", "YTA. I never understand people like you. Why the heck would she do all of that work for free for you? How often have you paid rent with exposure?", "YTA. I hate people like you. Does \u201cexposure\u201d pay the rent or buy groceries?

At the bare minimum you should pay for supplies. And age has nothing to do with talent or abilities. Free exposure is allowing you to post the sketch on social media not do a 60hr job.", "YTA. HUGE. So basically you're asking her to do a week and a half of work (based on a 40hour work week) and you expect her to do it for free? Sorry, for \"exposure\". Are you mad? She didn't even do it for free for her dad! Would you spend a week and a half of work for whatever it is you do for \"exposure\"? What if I swore it would be great exposure!\n\nEdited to add: You are an even bigger asshole because you didn't even offer to compensate her for the materials needed.", "YTA. \n\nIf she's so talented, pay her. \"Exposure\" is worth precisely nothing to a struggling artist with bills to pay, and the fact that you believe otherwise is just plain ignorant.\n\nYou're not looking to reward her with exposure, you're trying to exploit a relative for personal gain. If you don't think she's worth ~$40/hour, counter with another number. But don't pretend you're doing her some massive favour by allowing her art to be showcased in your precious office.", ">losing out on such a great opportunity\n\nSuch a great opportunity to do work for free? Wow, great opportunity. \n\nWhat work do you do in your office? Because I know hundreds of people. If you give me 60 hours of free work, I'll tell them you have a business. Great opportunity, right? YTA", "YTA. You really expected her to paint a mural in your office for exposure? Sixty hours of a highly skilled craft for free? And, you think this was a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201c? You are either very stupid or very entitled.", "YTA.  Maybe you were a bloodsucking social media influencer in a previous life, but now you\u2019re a professional with an apparently thriving practice that can afford to pay a fair wage for a quality product.  I\u2019d scream YTA for this, but my caps will have to speak for me.  \n\nWhy aren\u2019t you happy to to bolster the career of a family member and instead feel the need to bargain with them.  Beating up the help bothers me, Especially when it\u2019s family.", "YTA without a doubt. She doesn't even work for her own father for free (not that she should), yet you expect her to work for you for \"exposure\". Last time I checked, you can't eat exposure, or pay your rent with it.", "YTA, don't exploit your family for free labor. I feel like this is almost a bait post because of how hot button of an issue this is, and how squarely you are on the wrong and stereotypically oblivious side of it.\n\nYou could have haggled over price and maybe gotten a better deal because you're family, but the other side of that is why would you want to pay your \"husbands brothers daughter\" less than what she normally charges for a piece of art for your business? $40 an hour for something \"incredible\" isn't bad, and its a business expense, right?\n\nYTA, and \"people like you\" make being family a chore. I gave away so much free tech support in my younger days because \"family.\" Sure, Uncle Joe, I'd love to spend all of the time leading up to thanksgiving dinner trying to figure out why your wifi isn't working the way you want it to. That's swell, you guys just go on and have appetizers and family time without me.", "As soon as you thought you could get something for \"exposure\" you became YTA and will continue to be one until you learn to pay artists with money.", "So you're related by marriage to an artist, and expect to get her to paint for free for you as well, even though she might not have much money, and presumably your business is solvent as you say you have a lot of clients, and you can expense this.  If you hired painters to paint the walls white, you'd have to pay them.  Instead you're asking for her to go to trouble to beautify your waiting room, have your own input into what you want to see, and can write this off as an expense against taxes. Paint costs money, you know.  Time has value.  Talent doesn't alight on everyone--yet she has talent, and is nurturing it.  Yet you want her to paint for free--because she's \"only 20\"?  At what point does her time get a monetary value, in your eyes?  What a cheapskate.  Are you one of those people who look down on artists, because they tend not to make much, but contribute to their insolvency yourself, by expecting them to work for free?  Go get quotes from \"established\" mural artists, and see how she compares.  I don't know what your profession is, but would you do her root canal for free, or prosecute on her behalf for free, even if you could take family as clients?  I doubt it.  Is she losing out?  There are lots of waiting rooms in this world, besides yours.\n\nYTA", "YTA. People can't pay the bills with exposure. Also shouldn't expect free things when no one agreed on it being free then be upset when it's not free.", "Unless you've done work or offered to do work on her truck for free, why do you think her services should be offered to you for the price of exposure?\n\nHaving work done for free, is completely contingent on the job, as well as the relationship you two have. \n\nFor example, because I work in accounting, I tend to help family members with their books, or taxes. Depending on who you are, the amount of work I need to do, I may just do it for free, or I may charge you. \n\nDon't berate your niece for asking for payment for 60 hour job, not to mention the cost of pain and supplies needed.\n\nYikes, YTA", "YTA.  And I'm sure you get paid for the work that you do.  Why wouldn't a talented artist NOT get paid?  hmmm?", "BAHAHAHAHA!\n\nIs this even real?  Are there still people out there that think their exposure is really worth that much?  Are there people out there that don't think they need to negotiate a contract and can just assume a talented artist will work for free?  If she is that talented, you should be locking her in now, before her price goes up.\n\nDo 20 year olds not need to eat?  Not need to pay rent?  Not need to save for a vacation and for retirement?   You think she is so talented, but also at the same time she has no options for work so that she should gift you something?   That you are as close to her as her own father? Come on.  \n\nHow about this:  You pay her double her rate.  For every job she gets based on a referral from your shop, she pays you back 2%.  If she gets 50 jobs from you, your job is free.  I mean, since you are as close to her as her dad, you should want her to succeed.", "YTA. Exposure ain't paying the bills. And why you would expect to get the same deal as her father, even though it turned out not to be a freebie, is beyond me.", "YTA. if exposure \"in an office like yours\" is so valuable, why aren't *you* working for free? After all, your clients all learn your name and can see for themselves how talented you are!\n\nAlso, $2500 is a steal for what she's offering and you probably wouldn't get as good a price anywhere else for the quality. At that price point she is still doing you a favour and potentially taking a loss, at least compared to if she took another client who wasn't family.", "YTA \n\nPay for her talent and stop acting like her age means she\u2019s not entitled to be properly compensated for her work.\n\nShe gave her dad a freebie because he\u2019s her dad.", "YTA. Never ever ever assume anyone will want to work for free in exchange for \u201cexposure.\u201d If you value her work, you pay her for it AND give her the exposure to help her move her career along. \n\nYou owe her a huge apology.", "This can't be a real post.  This is like a r/ChoosingBeggars wet dream to read it from the other side.  In the 1% chance this is real, YTA\n\n\"She said it would be about $2500 since it was a 60 hour job.\"\n\nYep.

Here you are a reputable entrepreneur with \u201chundreds\u201d of people patronizing your business, yet you still cannot afford to pay $2500 for a mural.

I hear your plight and feel only pity \n\n\u2026 YTA", "**YTA**, and massively so.\n\n1) \"She is only 20\" is not a thing. 20 is an adult. 20-year-olds have jobs, including as artists. She's not in kindergarten. Her art isn't something you hang on the fridge, she's literally a muralist whose work is in commercial spaces, and who you are asking to create art for YOUR commercial office space . . . even as you're simultaneously trying to treat her like a child creating something amateurish. If that were genuinely the case, and how you perceived her skill, you wouldn't have been asking her to design artwork for your office space in the first place. You're an AH and deeply disingenuous.\n\n2) \"The value of exposure\" is not a thing. Exposure is fundamentally worthless 99% of the time. \"Exposure\" in the case of a mural on the wall of an office waiting room is 100% worthless. What kind of \"value\" did you THINK it would have? Did you think that she'd get so many paying clients from people admiring her mural in your waiting room that it would cover not only the cost of her materials and 60 hours of labour for the work she was doing for you, but multiple OTHER commissions as well? From a waiting room mural? Hardly. It doesn't matter if you have \"hundreds of people a week\" through your office if none of them do more than glance at the mural or admire it in passing. \"Exposure\" doesn't pay bills. What she said to you was absolutely correct. You tried to take advantage of her, and it's not just not-okay, it's presumptuous, entitled, and disgusting. You wanted all the benefits of her skill whilst neither acknowledging how skilled she is nor paying for what you were getting.\n\n3) You were so entitled and presumptuous that you didn't even bother to ASK if she painted the huge mural for her dad for free, which implies that you take for granted that people should be able to take advantage of the talents and labour of others (especially of artists) as a matter of course. Even her dad isn't that much of an AH. He paid for her hard work with a truck worth thousands of dollars. For her to paint a mural for you would cost her materials as well as hours of labour. You didn't even offer to cover the materials. You literally wanted something that would have cost HER money and time to do for you, and you think she might be the AH.\n\nYou're upset because people saw you for what you are - a deeply entitled person who wants people to do things for you but doesn't want to treat them respectfully or pay them for their work, and doesn't see why that's problematic - and treated you accordingly. YTA.", "hahah YTA - exposure doesn't pay the bills.", "YTA.  You are not entitled to free work from anyone.  She is right - exposure doesn't pay her bills.  If you don't want to pay, you don't get the mural, or you find someone who is willing to do one for \"exposure.\". Good luck.", "Yta you pay people for their time and work", "Exposure doesn't pay bills. YTA. Pay your niece for her WORK.", "YTA. Pay up or shut up.", "YTA\n\nDo you sell houses for free? If not, why not? Isn't putting your sign out in front of a house serving as exposure for you?\n\nIf you deserve to be paid, then why doesn't she? Is her being an artist not a form of her earning a living?\n\nYou need to pay her for her time and her talent. And whatever deal she has between her and her dad is none of your business, by the way. \n\nI detest entitled attitudes like yours.", "YTA.\n\nYes you were wrong.  You admit freely that she's very talented.  Exposure of her work won't pay her bills now, money will.  Exposure MIGHT pay future bills but there's no guarantee.\n\nApologize and decide whether or not her fees are worth it.   If they are, pay her.   Maybe you can make a deal with her for some sort of referral bonus, if future jobs give her paying work, but don't just assume it will.  I've seen all kinds of awesome paintings in my life, but have actually commissioned VERY FEW myself.   \n\nI don't know what kind of office you own, but if she wanted your services, would you offer them for free prior to this exchange?  Be honest.  \n\nAnd why would you even think you're on the same level as her dad?  You're extended family.  He's immediate family.  And even he compensated her with a vehicle for her work. \n\nYou were wrong.  Even more so for arguing with her about it.  Be a decent person and admit it.  She has every right to want to profit off of an estimated 60 hours of labor.  I think the most you should have asked is whether or not she was giving you a family discount so that if you had someone inquire about her work (if you purchase it), you wouldn't be passing on bad info.", "YTA. Hahaha the entitlement is BIG on this one. You thought you were going to cheat this talented young woman, also a family member, by using the worst currency possible: Exposure.

I can't understand why you would think she would be losing out on a great opportunity by allowing her to work for 60 hours for free in exchange for you getting a hand painted mural. I think you were looking to give one person a great opportunity- and it wasn't your niece.", "YTA\u2026one thing to hope it is free or a good discount and another to expect someone to work for free.", "YTA \n\nYou know about the existence of Reddit but have never come across one of the many many articles blasting people who think they can pay for art with exposure?\n\nFirst one I found:\n\nhttps://www.boredpanda.com/working-for-exposure-tweets/", "YTA, you are trying to exploit your husband's niece. Exposure doesn't pay anyone's expenses, as she traded her own father a vehicle for the mural she did at his shop.  Either pay her to do the mural or apologize for attempting to exploit her for your own benefit.", "Yta, a possible solution though, pay the 2500 dollars and everyti.e she gets a sale from your exposure you provided, you get a cash reward. Assuming the exposure is worthwhile, you'll make money off it. If the exposure doesn't help her, like she thinks, she will co e out ahead.\n\nWin win", "YTA\n\nPeople need to stop using \u201cexposure\u201d as payment. If she thought it was worth it for her career, she would have priced accordingly.", "YTA, exposure does not pay bills. You are not her father. You are an entitled person.", "YTA you suuuuuuuck lmfao", "YTA.\nYou have \"hundreds of people a week with money to spend\" come through your office, and none of them pay you enough to afford to compensate an artist for their work? \nYou must be running your business for the exposure.", "Thanks, but, you can't eat exposure. ANY kind of art that's worth anything takes a long time to cultivate, not to mention the money in supplies, gas, and schooling to perfect that craft. It takes hours of work to do a mural, and that is time she could be spending doing a paid job. \n\nI've done enough free labor to know now when I'm being taken advantage of. I'm glad your niece isn't. She wasn't giving you a painting as a gift something she did on her own time, just cause, you approached her with a job offer you just expected to be free. \n\nYTA.", "Huge YTA.  Exposure in an office doesn\u2019t mean squat.  That\u2019s a lot of work and expecting to have it done for free is insulting.  She\u2019s already giving you a family discount at that price.  Get over yourself and apologize", "YTA. Pay artists for their work or don\u2019t have work done. I\u2019m sick of entitled people thinking they can guilt family artists into free art. A mural will take her hours/days to do along with materials and you expect it for free?! \n\nNot only that \u201cshe\u2019s only 20\u201d is the most bs excuse ever. She\u2019s an adult! And this is her profession, pay the lady! \n\n**YTA and your entitled**", "YTA, pay your fucking artists.", "YTA. Would you like it if someone didn't want to pay for your serviced saying that they will just tell people on social media about you? No, you wouldn't work for free. She didn't do her dad's mural for free. You sound entitled. I would def not recommend you or your business to anyone.", "C\u2019mon now, you\u2019re really using the exposure argument in 2022? YTA, pay up or no mural. Simple as that.", "YTA - exposure is worth exactly nothing to an artist.  I've done a lot of free art for my mom. Because she's my MOM. You arent this person's parent and apparently have no respect for her as an artist. \n\nGo get a quote from someone you would be willing to pay for the work. Being 20 doesn't mean your niece shouldn't be paid. And being family means you should want to pay her and help her succeed. How does your exposure translate into actual money?", "Seriously! 60+ hours of work! That comes out to about $42/hr which is super reasonable for a skilled profession (like art)", "Super proud of niece for figuring out that the whole \u201cexposure\u201d thing is a scam at age 20!", "> 'Paying someone in exposure' is a con, that's how a lot of artists feel.\n\nBecause it is a con.", "Technically the mural wasn\u2019t a gift to her father if he got her or helped pay for a vehicle so if anything she got a payment for her work just not necessarily in money.", "It says in the post that her father bought her a truck in exchange for the mural she created for him. He absolutely paid her.", "Oh, assholes like this are pretty easy to understand.  They are selfish, entitled, shitty cheapskates that appreciate nothing, never go out of their way for anyone, and think the entire world owes them whatever it is they want because they mistakenly think they deserve it.  \n\nYTA - enjoy being the pariah OP.  You have more than earned it.  I sincerely hope you receive nothing but coal in a stocking for Christmas because that\u2019s all you deserve.", "What's more he wants to profit from her work and talent and figures that because she's kin by marriage she's owed. WTF. \n\nYTA- \n\napologize to her and her parents and the rest of the family!", "I own a very busy real estate office, so yes in the end it would because my customers would hire her to paint their murals", "I\u2019m a real estate agent but social media is a huge part of my job", "She didn't even do it for free for her dad! She said she did it in trade for a truck.", "She didn't give her dad a freebie. He bought her a new truck in exchange for her work. That's a payment worth thousands of dollars.", "# YTA\n\u201cExposure\u201d *rolls eyes* She should\u2019ve just laughed in your face.", "I paid my nephew $45/hour + his favourite dinner and desert to paint a mural in my kids playroom, and that was mates rates. The next lowest price was $60/hour and pay for all supplies. OP is getting a good deal from her niece and doesn't even appreciate it.", "Ah you\u2019re right you\u2019re right", "I just think it's so funny that OP whines, \"But you did your dad's for free!\". I mean, she didn't; she did the mural in exchange for a whole ass truck. But even if she DID do it for free, that's her father. How do you not see that you are not in the same category as him?", ">I own a very busy real estate office\n\nSo, it sounds like you should be able to afford it, but instead you just want to take advantage of your niece.", "Yeah right. Keep telling yourself that.", "I want you to be my real estate agent, but I'm not going to pay you anything.  Instead, you will get exposure by putting your name and face on the for sale sign posted to my front lawn, and from showing buyers and hosting group house showings. \n\nYTA.", "Have you ever seen a mural/painting in an office/anywhere and decided to hire the artist that did it?", "Not busy enough for you to afford her work though?", "If your so busy why can't you pay? Are a lot of people asking for murals?", "Are there contracts or agreements in place between your customers and your niece that they will hire her and that she will make $xxxx amount of money in the future? \n\nOr is this some fantasy you like to sell to naive people to get them to give you swag and services for free?\n\nIf the latter, then get the fuck outta here with that wanna-be influencer bullshit.", "If you own such a busy real estate office, you should be able to pay for the work you're trying to commission.", "So, if you're sooo busy, I assume you're making money. Why do you not value your niece's work? Is it a lack of education on your side? What you do is not better than, more important than, nor more valuable than what your niece does. For goodness sakes, you sell real estate! Some architect/artist/designer designed the buildings you sell , the desk you sit at, your office, the clothes you wear, the phone you use, your website, etc. Get over yourself or better yet go educate yourself on the value of art and aesthetics in culture/society. YTA", "Not necessarily\u2026\u2026your clients aren\u2019t required to do anything. \n\nSounds like you can afford the mural. You\u2019re just cheap", "Prove it, because you are 100% dead wrong here. Show actual qualitative data that says by painting this mural your niece will be able to track and earn over $2500 worth of business from people seeing that mural in your office. It's been proven time and time again in the last 10 years that \"exposure\" doesn't mean anything and working for \"exposure\" literally leads to loss. Like everyone else has said, do you just sell a house for free because the homeowners have lots of friends that come by? You are so beyond fucking stupid and an asshole to boot.", "Will you get me a house for free? It would be great exposure, think of how generous you'd look!", "Oh so you take exposure for the houses you sell?  How much exposure for a mansion?", "I hope the niece posts the experience on r/ChoosingBeggars", "For real. She's gloating about how good her business is and yet can't even pay someone to do a mural. How embarrassing!.", "Do you know how often this happens to us? All the time", "Yes actually it\u2019s a huge part of the real estate game.", "Yeah, and those people are ALSO assholes.  It doesn't excuse you being an asshole here.", "But you paid the other artists right?", "No I mean you get paid in exposure. Not just receive exposure and money. You get no money from the houses you sell", "Social media wasn\u2019t always a thing."]}
