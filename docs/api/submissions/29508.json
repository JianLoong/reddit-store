Surely he will be devastated and will never forget how he had to leave the church. \nNTA, they are overreacting. If the child was interrupting the ceremony, a reasonable course of action was to leave with him for a moment.\nNot to mention he shouldn't have been there in the first place.", "Nta this is literally what the couple was trying to avoid.  He's a baby. He does not give a shit if he's at a wedding.", "NTA - if your kid is making noise (even happy ones) they need to be taken out of a ceremony like that. It's common sense and courtesy. Add the layer of the wedding being mostly childfree, and this person definitely should have taken the baby out if not have left it with the nanny from the start. You advocated for the bride and groom! What does the bride think of what happened?", "NTA.  The baby was visibly bothering one of the grooms and that was their day, not the baby's.", "NTA.

Nothing wrong with bringing kids to a wedding or church, but when they get disruptive, it's up to the parent to take them out.  In this case, the parent didn't, so OP had to speak up.", "So, that side of the family is using \u201cfamily oriented,\u201d to make it sound like the rest of you aren\u2019t.

My SIL was getting married. Son was 4 and a typical terror but still loved naps. I held that kid off for 2 hours. About 15 minutes before the ceremony, my hubby and I sat down and started the routine. By the time the music started, that kid was ZONKED. Everyone commented after the ceremony how quiet he was and how cute he was sleeping.  WIINN!!!\n\nAnyways. NTA. You said exactly what the bride was subtly trying to say... take your noisy kid and leave. I would have sent you a thank you card with a gift card!!!", "NTA OP.  Did your cousin miss the part where it\u2019s supposed to be a child free wedding?  You had every right to ask them to leave even before the ceremony.", "Nope, NTA. Your cousin and Aunt I\u2019m sure knew it was suppose to be child free. They clearly think they\u2019re exception to the rules the bride & groom set. Cousin should\u2019ve never even been allowed sit to down with her baby in church, someone should\u2019ve stopped her before it got to this point.", "The couple made IT CLEAR they didn\u2019t want any  very young children at their wedding because of this reason. \n& She still brought her child, why couldn\u2019t she have the nanny watch the child at home or at their hotel room? \nWhy do some people  think everyone wants to hear their child being loud at an event children shouldn\u2019t even be at?", "yeah, I thought for something like 20 years that I wasn't at my aunt and uncle's wedding. People tell stories about it but the only stories of the kids, involve my younger cousin, so I just assumed that for reasons I wasn't there. It only came up in conversation maybe 5 years ago about my being there.\n\nI was 4 when this wedding happened. I have plenty of memories of being 4 but none of this wedding.", "Honestly we didn\u2019t talk about it much afterwards (didn\u2019t want to start anymore drama at her wedding) but she was visibly much more relaxed the rest of the ceremony.", "Here\u2019s a thought- the bride and groom get to decide who gets to be at the wedding..  off they want to make exceptions to their child free rule, then that is wholly okay.", "So you don't think the people having the wedding should be able to decide who goes? Either all children are invited or none? Child free can mean whatever they want it to mean.", "Eh, having attending close to a dozen stupid weddings this year? There's a clear difference in a 10 year old who can behave, and a babbling infant/toddlers running around. 3 of the weddings I attended were kid free, aside from the flower girls, and the groom's little sister (2 different ones\\*) Both their parents past, she lives with their aunt. Everyone respected that. I don't think she should've had to miss her brother's wedding, because they didn't want to have everyone bring their kids potentially.", "A child free wedding ceremony should not be interrupted by an infant.", "It wasn't the cousins' wedding either. Childfree means don't bring your precious bundle to the wedding. The bride was upset so OP acted.", "Whole part got deleted, edit to add: YES! THIS. I barely remember attending ones where I was IN the wedding as a child, lol.\\*   \nMaybe I'm the AH, but I'll never understand people who get mad about what other people want for their weddings. Fair or unfair. You're a guest to someone else's big day. You ARE NOT required to be there. You were invited. So why do people (usually family) want to have some sort of say? It isn't about you. It honestly isn't even about bringing two families together. It's about the bride. The groom. And whatever they want. Don't like it? Don't...attend..? No need to be pissed. No need to be upset. If you don't want to celebrate the way they do, then be elsewhere.", "And make sure they knew messed up that was", "I\u2019d leave. And make sure everyone knew why.", "If I was one of the people that got told no kids and saw a kid that was allowed I\u2019d be pissed and leave.", "Yeah, it shouldn't be, but it is also not OPs place to tell people to leave unless he was charged with doing so by the couple.", "and I admit I'm confused. \n\nCousin brought the nanny- why was the baby not with the nanny during the ceremony? was she trying to show off how cute and sweet her baby was to everyone? that only works if the baby sleeps thru the ceremony, especially when your child hasn't been invited to the event.", "So you're saying that if you were invited to a wedding that was child free, but found out that one child was allowed to attend because they are known to the bride and groom and have proved that they will be well behaved, that you would leave in the middle of the wedding or reception strictly because there is a single, well behaved child there? Or is this because you would feel it is unfair that you couldn't bring your kids that the bride and groom may not know and have no reason to believe will be well behaved? Seems like an extreme reaction to something as mundane as a child being at a child free wedding. Are you going to be unable to control yourself at some point during the evening and do something that you shouldn't do in the presence of a child?", "Exactly. I was really confused by the time I saw 'brought the nanny for the reception' but..not the ceremony? Cousin knew what she was doing there. I doubt any nanny, who was BROUGHT WITH/HIRED for the time, would say 'no. I'm not watching him any additional time.'", "They wouldn\u2019t just leave in the middle they\u2019d \u201cMake sure everyone knew\u201d aka make a scene at the wedding\u2026 like the children they didn\u2019t get to bring. This is how to not get invited to things anymore.", "Child free means child free. I\u2019d leave and not go back. And if I was asked I\u2019d say why.", "My sister has twins so she didn't do this when her friends got married and my nieces were little, but I could see her doing it if she had one child.\n\nWanting to show off how \"well behaved\" her child was.\n\nMy nieces are great but they're kids. When they were toddlers, my mom was known to pay for the meals for people who sat near us in nicer restaurants because my nieces were toddlers. (And yes, some toddlers can do meals out. A close friend of mine's daughter never had a issue but she did meals out somewhat regularly. And that is a huge difference.)", "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT THEIR IS A CHILD PRESENT AT THIS SO CALLED \"CHILDLESS WEDDING\"! I WILL BE LEAVING NOW AS IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THE BRIDE AND GROOM FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR PROMISE OF A CHILDLESS WEDDING, MORE IMPORTANT THAT MY PRESENCE HERE IS. IF THIS WAS GOING TO BE A 'MOSTLY CHILDLESS WEDDING IN THAT YOU CAN'T BRING YOUR CHILDREN BUT WE ARE MAKING AN EXCEPTION FOR ONE CHILD THAT WE KNOW WILL ENJOY IT AND BE WELL BEHAVED' I NEVER WOULD HAVE COME IN THE FIRST PLACE. GOOD DAY.", "I\u2019d make sure they knew AFTER the wedding.", "But why does a single well behaved child being there make you want to leave in the first place? Is is the fact that they said no kids but allowed one? Are you uncomfortable around kids? Would you have not gone in the first place if you knew there would be any children there? And at what point would you leave? If you looked over mid-way through the ceremony and noticed a child sitting on the other side of the room, would that be your cue to get up and leave? If you didn't notice until the speeches, would that be when you make your exit? Would you leave even if you have absolutely zero interaction with the child? Would someone simply mentioning that a single child was allowed to attend be enough to send you packing? Leaving is a very strange response to one child who is well behaved being at a wedding, even if it was advertised as 'child free'.", "Why would you make sure they know at all? Why do you get to judge them based on who they decided to invite to the wedding?"]}
