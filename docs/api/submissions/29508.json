Either all children are invited or none? Child free can mean whatever they want it to mean.", "Eh, having attending close to a dozen stupid weddings this year? There's a clear difference in a 10 year old who can behave, and a babbling infant/toddlers running around. 3 of the weddings I attended were kid free, aside from the flower girls, and the groom's little sister (2 different ones\\*) Both their parents past, she lives with their aunt.

Fair or unfair. You're a guest to someone else's big day. You ARE NOT required to be there. You were invited. So why do people (usually family) want to have some sort of say? It isn't about you. It honestly isn't even about bringing two families together. It's about the bride. The groom. And whatever they want. Don't like it? Don't...attend..? No need to be pissed. No need to be upset.

Or is this because you would feel it is unfair that you couldn't bring your kids that the bride and groom may not know and have no reason to believe will be well behaved? Seems like an extreme reaction to something as mundane as a child being at a child free wedding. Are you going to be unable to control yourself at some point during the evening and do something that you shouldn't do in the presence of a child?", "Exactly. I was really confused by the time I saw 'brought the nanny for the reception' but..not the ceremony? Cousin knew what she was doing there. I doubt any nanny, who was BROUGHT WITH/HIRED for the time, would say 'no. I'm not watching him any additional time.'", "They wouldn\u2019t just leave in the middle they\u2019d \u201cMake sure everyone knew\u201d aka make a scene at the wedding\u2026 like the children they didn\u2019t get to bring.

When they were toddlers, my mom was known to pay for the meals for people who sat near us in nicer restaurants because my nieces were toddlers. (And yes, some toddlers can do meals out.

GOOD DAY.", "I\u2019d make sure they knew AFTER the wedding.", "But why does a single well behaved child being there make you want to leave in the first place? Is is the fact that they said no kids but allowed one? Are you uncomfortable around kids? Would you have not gone in the first place if you knew there would be any children there? And at what point would you leave? If you looked over mid-way through the ceremony and noticed a child sitting on the other side of the room, would that be your cue to get up and leave? If you didn't notice until the speeches, would that be when you make your exit? Would you leave even if you have absolutely zero interaction with the child? Would someone simply mentioning that a single child was allowed to attend be enough to send you packing? Leaving is a very strange response to one child who is well behaved being at a wedding, even if it was advertised as 'child free'.", "Why would you make sure they know at all?

My mom (not related to the bride, but invited to the wedding) followed me out as discreetly as possible.\n\nHanging out with my daughter and my mom during half of the wedding is one of the sweetest memories I will ever have. After baby girl quieted down, we rejoined the ceremony in the back of the church.\n\nI would not do it differently ever for anyone.

You did the right thing.", "Your wedding your rules.  Even with the baby not crying they can be VERY loud, especially in a acoustically sensitive place like a church.

It's hilarious in the house, not so funny in a church.  NTA", "NTA. What you did was necessary since your cousin apparently doesn't have any common sense.  \nThe AH's here are numerous but you are not one of them.

The couple was not planning to have a flower girl and instead have a dog walked down the aisle with it's owner tossing petals. So after much nagging from the relative, they agree to let the girl be in the wedding. Let me tell you that girl was hilarious... She made the angriest face I've ever seen and clutched the basket of petals like someone was about to steal it from her. Not one petal was tossed and I'm so excited for the photos because it's going to be HILARIOUS. When I told the bride later, she was furious about this and said \"I knew she didn't want to be in the wedding! [Relative] just wanted to bring her, and she brought her 10yr old son too without even telling us!\" The best part was at the reception when one of the bartenders decided she was too hot in her body fishnets and mini skirt and decided to only be in her bra and panties and the relative immediately took the kids home. It was a metal goth themed wedding, btw.\n\nWedding #2: not sure who's idea it was to have a flower girl, but she behaved exactly like flower girl in wedding #1 and I was dying inside watching her walk down the aisle with her mom, who encouraged her to just move quickly and not throw petals. The best man apparently also had a baby recently, so they must have agreed to let baby mama bring it, and while the literal infant didn't cry, it made noises during the entire ceremony (she eventually took it away since you could barely hear the vows over it's shrieks). During the reception, which was inside (ceremony was outside and it was a beautiful day and not even cold when it got darker), the toasts begin and the bride's dad is telling this beautiful story about his struggles of early parenthood and raising his daughter and this baby just starts squealing again.

Being Catholic, my father had the priest performing the rosary.  We had several friends and families bring their small children mine included.  Immediate family sat in the front row, this is important, my son was sitting beside me on the wooden pew of the funeral homes chapel.  The entire chapel was reciting the rosary along with the priest.  Right in the middle,  we all hear someone rip one made louder by the bench.  My son says excuse me, I\u2019m horrified.  He\u2019s sitting there trying to be quiet and I see him fidgeting and lift one little cheek and boom out comes another.  I look up at the priest and he\u2019s being a trooper and doesn\u2019t stop but you can see him holding back a laugh.  His face was red from stifling a laugh.  When the ceremony was over the priest came over and said my dad would\u2019ve been rolling with laughter.  He told my son I know your going to be a handful when you start school.  Afterwards family and friends who weren\u2019t Catholic said that it was so hard to not laugh but it was fitting and glad that it was my child and not theirs. Needless to say the priest would share the story over the years.  My grandmother thought it wasn\u2019t cool but she said my father her son would\u2019ve loved the non conventional ceremony.", "NTA, they should have followed what the couple wanted and not brought the baby or had someone stay home with him.

I thought it was just common knowledge that if a young child is making distracting noise during a the ceremony, you take them outside. It\u2019s why patents with small kids try to sit at the end of pews, in case they have to step outside. I assume during any ceremony that isn\u2019t child-free it\u2019ll happen at least once.

Anyone who doesn't make use of this room is an AH. We used to skip the popular morning service because it was full of crying babies and noisy kids.", "NTA  At my friend's (\"Carla\") wedding, her 10 month old niece started crying.  Her sister missed the ceremony because she had to remove her baby from the building.  Later, after the ceremony, the rabbi told Carla that a child that young doesn't belong at a wedding.  Carla didn't want her sister to bring the baby.  Unfortunately, Carla's family told her \"You don't want the baby there because you're afraid she'll get more attention than you.\"  Well, the kid did take the attention away from her at the ceremony, but not in a good way.    \n\nAt another wedding, some guests brought their three or four year old boy.  They were allowing him to run on the seat of their pew, which was very noisy,  He was allowed to continue this behavior during the ceremony (which was being taped).  Of course, the kid eventually slips, falls down and starts crying.  \n\nIf a child is not able to sit still and keep quiet, it does not belong at a wedding ceremony and probably shouldn't be brought to the reception.", "NTA- Forcing kids into a wedding they're not welcome at is worse than wearing white. The exact reason is the fact that the kid will inevitably interrupt the ceremony. Tons of time, money and emotion go into that moment for the two people at the altar and people think it fine if not cute if a baby interrupts that. It's malicious, especially if the couple are childfree, and aren't thinking 'Soon we shall have our own baby to ruin events with, yay!'", "NTA. You were just trying to support the bride\u2019s wishes. \n\nBut here\u2019s some food for thought for all the people who are rigid about their \u201cchild free\u201d wedding rules. My husband and I had a child free wedding, no exceptions. Our guests generally honored this without issue. On the day of our wedding, however, there were unexpectedly THREE babies in attendance. During the ceremony, one started crying and for a few moments, it was ALL I could hear. I felt SO angry. Fast forward, and I became a mother myself. And oh my effing god\u2026I realized what a total ignoramus I was to expect the people I loved to attend despite having recently welcomed a baby. I still dislike the disruption caused, but I am soooo much more empathetic to the choice these parents made to bring their young children. I\u2019d rather have had them attend and suffer the minor disruption. It really didn\u2019t detract from my day all that much, because what I remember much more was and is my happiness. Looking back, I wish I would have taken a more compassionate approach. Also\u2026I know now what I didn\u2019t before: kids are awesome. All are well meaning, and most are well mannered in an age appropriate way.", "I mean simply the fact that your brother and his fiance thanked you shows that you did the right thing. It's their wedding, it's their day to enjoy doesn't matter if you aunt was happy or not, it's not her day. Believe me you did the right thing.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, it might be an oversight at the time of writing your post, but there is a difference between a ceremony and a reception, so unless the whole thing was supposed to be childfree, she wasn't out of line bringing her baby.\n\nSecond, sure a wedding is a special day for the bride and groom, but telling your family not to bring their kids is an asshole move to begin with. So imo anything that goes to support this, even though it makes the bride happy, is still just being an asshole.\n\nThird, if the baby was crying, sure, go to the back of the church and calm them down, but what kind of stuck up person gets mad at a baby's babbling? I have kids, my brother has kids, most of my friends have kids, and babbling is far from being a problem so big that it requires an eviction.\n\nFinally, as a married man I can guarantee you one thing; nobody, not even the bride and groom, are going to remember a wedding due to how picture perfect it was. In fact, what everyone remembers about those events are the blunders. You can shrug them off and laugh about them both at the time and for years to come (like how I forgot I was supposed to say \"I do\", which my wife loves to remind me of) or you can make a big deal out of them and kick a mother and her baby out, which she will never forget. Seriously, wouldn't it have been better to be able to think back with your brother and SIL in a couple years and go \"remember when little Timmy kept babbling at your wedding\" and share a laugh?

A friend asked me if he could bring his baby to my wedding ceremony (church) because they basically had separation anxiety (the parents, the babie was fine) and I agreed because baby was well behaved and wasn't attending to the dinner or the party. Plus, we have been friends for ages and I kinda liked having that baby in my basically child free wedding. The thing is, my friends sit in the last row if the church, and basically hold the baby right next to the door. Whenever the baby made a minimum noise they leave, than came back. It's common sense. I understand a baby could be disruptive but that's how they work, they cry, they mumble so it's up to the parents to have common sense and leave is the baby is visible bothering the bride. \n\nI hope my grammar wasn't horrible.
