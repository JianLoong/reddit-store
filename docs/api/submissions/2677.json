And now on this year's scholarship exam she only got 15% discount.\n\nLot of odd comments here...\n\nWhy would anyone say Y T A and not E S H? Barbara is 15 and definitely needs to be taking responsibility for passing in her projects. Especially when she knows that it would cost her family nearly half the tuition which they are struggling to pay as is.\n\nAlso what's with all the people saying that if OP can't afford it without the discount they shouldn't be sending any kids there? well *obviously* the answer is OP should just go out and work harder and make more money ./s\n\nI don't see the favoritism aspect either. OP is clearly hoping that as John spends more time in the private school he will learn more and get bigger discounts. Meanwhile Barbara seems to be slacking off and getting lower ones. I would never fault someone for not knowing something, but simply not passing in 30% of your grade? \n\nAnd on top of all of this, OP even spent more to get Private tutors for her!!\n\nDefinitely an NTA from me.", "NTA. Your daughter \"forgot\" to turn in 2 assignments? She obviously does not care as much as she wants to believe she does. That kind of thing is a privilege, not a right. She wants the privilege, she has to hold up her part of the bargain (i.e. getting the grade and especially NOT forgetting to turn in work).", "NTA. Your daughter didn't hold up her end of the deal. I think most of YTAs are Americans who don't realize how advantageous a good education in poor countries are. Therefore parents sacrifice anything and everything to ensure children get a good education.", "INFO: She said you are playing favorites have you ever picked one of her bothers over her or made her give something up for her brother before ?", "NTA, and frankly I am *baffled* by the amount of Y-T-A comments here.  So let me get this straight, you got private lessons to help Barb in school, and Barb still:\n\ni) Straight-up \u201cforgot\u201d to hand in multiple school assignments;\n\nii) Did badly on another test;\n\niii) Didn\u2019t do well enough in the class in general to avoid taking the final test;\n\niv) Now refuses to take another scholarship test (yes, I know you can only take them at certain times, but OP says near the end daughter doesn\u2019t want to do another one anyway);\n\nAnd is complaining that her brothers aren\u2019t being punished for the consequences of *her* actions?  That\u2019s not favouritism.  If anything, it would be favouritism if you *did* punish your sons.  It\u2019s not their fault their sister forgot to hand in multiple school assignments and did badly on a test even after private tutoring.  They don\u2019t deserve to be punished for her actions, and your daughter is acting entitled.", "I can tell that a lot of people in the comments did not grow up in low income families. The daughter lost the privilege of going to this school by not upholding her end of the bargain and doing her school work. The other kids should not have to pay for this. NTA\n\nThe parents are doing everything possible to ensure all the kids get the best education and the daughter has not made the most of this and has squandered the opportunity for no apparent reason.\n\nETA: How are people missing the important part of the post? The daughter only needed to take a second scholarship assessment test because she failed a class that she did not submit two assignments for. As a result she essentially lost her previous scholarship and then needed to take another test and this time scored more poorly than previously.", "NTA.

And now she has to deal with the consequences. This is a hard but important lesson about consequences and fairness. It\u2019s not fair to her brothers for them to lose out because of her mistakes. \n\nI\u2019m intrigued as to what country has private schools with such varying tuitions. Though I do dig the scholarship test, that\u2019s a unique twist.", "YTA. If you can't afford private school without a discount then you can't afford the private school. \n\nWhat did you expect to happen? Your daughter would he happy to go to public school because her parents banked on her getting a discount rather than being realistic about what they could afford?\n\nTo top it off, you're still sending her 2 siblings to the school!\n\nETA: to everyone disagreeing: how is it fair that the youngest goes to private school when he received an even lower score than Barbara? She is indeed being punished for something out of her control and the right thing to do here would be keep the youngest son in public school and continue having Barb go to private school.  Esp. Considering she *forgot* to turn in two assignments, out of hundreds. Is everyone in my comments saying they're perfect and never forgot anything in school or their daily life? \n\nThis is literally choosing one child over another. It makes me wonder how many other times Barbara has felt this way as the middle child?\n\nIt is 100% not alright to punish a child by using money and education. The only thing this will accomplish is a lifetime of resentment from Barb, along with emotional, educational and social trauma for forcing her to go to a different school for (a single?) year.\n\nOPs saw she was struggling, but neither of them prepared for this exact situation other than throwing their hands in the air and picking which child would be the odd one out.\n\nThe fact that OP hasn't made one comment in their own thread is proof enough for me that OP didn't come here to see if they were actually TA, they wanted vindication from playing favorites which they absolutely are.\n\nIf they thought Barb was struggling now, I can't wait to see next year's post of \"My middle child is rebelling and not going to the school I forced her to go to aita?\"\n\nMy judgment remains: OP and her husband are assholes for enrolling their kids in school they can't afford, esp. when the reality is that they're just picking one kid over the other.", "So Barb didn't do as well on the scholarship test, and her discount dropped from 40% to 15%. You want to tell her that you can't afford to pay for her education now, whereas you can afford to pay for her brothers' education. So you want to send her to the terrible public school instead. \n\nYou say that she can always take the scholarship test again next year. This is nonsense, and you know it. After a year in the terrible school, she won't magically do better in the scholarship test. So if you pull her out now, you are basically ruining her education.\n\nSounds like YTA, to be honest.", "NTA if Barbara knew that is she scored badly she would be pulled out. She's old enough to know that she needs to turn in major assignments. The other kids shouldn't be punished for her errors.", "NTA. barabara deserved it for slacking and not signing in her projects. im 13 and even i am more responsible that her. if she isnt doing well in school at 15 she msot likely wont get better. the youngest on the other hand still has a chance of being better and deserving a privat school", "NTA, she screwed herself up by not turning in her assignments.

It's no different then getting a scholarship that pays ,40% of the tuition but the child has to keep a gpa. If the child missed the gpa and the parents couldn't afford it anymore why would you blame the parents.", "NTA. You can't afford to send Barbara to a private school. It's not that you think she should be punished but you just don't have the means to send all 3 at the same time. Unlike Barbara, John hasn't even had the opportunity to go to a good school.

I don't see how you're TA for something so out of your hands.", "why people here tend to favorite oldest children? sorry, if you cant REMEMBER to send projects, you deserve to lose school privileges, and sending her to private school and the son to public would be not fair, since she already had her chance", "INFO: am I the only one wondering what country this is where kids younger than 18 take yearly scholarship tests that aren\u2019t pass/fail, which award a \u201cdiscount\u201d on tuition based on the scores from these tests, and increase cost in tuition as the child gets older?", "NTA Going against the grain here to say Barb screwed up by not being diligent with her studies, not turning in projects and thus requiring to take the test to pass the year (if I have it backwards, it may be because reading this post was like reading a mathematical problem including percentages and polynomials, not my forte)\n\nI don't know if you have any relatives who can help out so she can stay in the school of her choice?

So I have 40 years experience with ADHD.  So much in fact that I still think of myself as having ADD, because I was never hyper, I was a space cadet.  I didn't figit in class, I'd stop paying attention and stare into space.  And with being the kid what was obviously so bright, but would lose her train of thought mid-sentence.  Forgetting homework, forgetting projects, doing homework but leaving it at home.  Even as an adult, a house that looks like a tornado ran through it.  \n\nI have excecutive function that makes it very hard to switch tasks. Even when the other task would be better.  I was once in a bar at a conference waiting for a friend and de-duping my database.  I got tired and wanted to go to bed, but I felt like I was stuck deduping the database. Couldn't get up, couldn't talk to the other people there.  I was just the wierdo working in the bar.\n\nI've even found myself stuck sitting on the side of my bed.  I was sitting on my bed playing solitaire on my phone.  I wanted to lie down and play more complicated games on my tablet.  Taking off my shoes and lying down and grabbing the tablet would have taken less than 10 seconds, but was still a barrier I couldn't seem to get over.", "Yup. My kid is autistic and consistently will do work then forget to turn it in.", "it's 2 homeworks in a whole year. bold of you to try and diagnose her based on that.", "Thank you for explaining that; it sounds very hard to live with. Isn\u2019t there medication you can take?", "There is! Medication does help a little. \n\nThere\u2019s a couple weird things about ADHD meds tho - for one, most of them are based in dexamphetamine or things like that so\u2026.a few side effects, good and bad.\n\nAnother - many women/people who menstruate find their meds don\u2019t work or work less well on or around their period. Whole other issue. \n\nMy meds are pretty good for me. My side effects are teeth grinding mostly, and loss of appetite. I do not eat during the day as much as I should. My appetite issues have made me far pickier, it\u2019s harder to eat now when I\u2019m not feeling hungry so I have to REALLY enjoy the food to eat which can be a struggle sometimes. \nThe worst part was when I didn\u2019t realise I wasn\u2019t really eating so I actually legit was malnourished and had my hair start thinning (I\u2019m much better these days at eating and making sure I take a lot of vitamins and supplements to keep myself functioning well! \nI can be a bit irritable when my meds start wearing off because all the quiet in my head fades to noise again and it\u2019s like stepping out of a bathroom into a club dance floor. They\u2019re minor things. \n\nI\u2019m on two meds for it pretty much - one that lasts 8 hours, and a \u2018top up\u2019 4 hour one for when I need it. I will say my meds have improved my quality of life drastically.\n\nMy ADHD led to me \u2018dopamine seeking\u2019 with a lot of risky or unhealthy behaviours. Binge eating, excessive drinking, smoking (that was a big one) impulse buying. Anything with instant gratification. Since starting my meds, I don\u2019t binge eat. I drink like, twice a month and in moderation. My impulse buying has plummeted. \n\nAnd I will say my meds have helped my focus. It\u2019s far easier for me to clean and exist. My brain, usually overcrowded with noise, is far quieter. I can brush my teeth twice a day these days! I FLOSS (amazing I never have before). \n\nBut meds can\u2019t fix everything. Things are easier but they aren\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s easier to push pass my executive dysfunction or paralysis and make my bed but it\u2019s bot as mindless a task for me as it is for my fianc\u00e9e. I still have to grapple a little to do it. \nIt\u2019s easier to vacuum but it still takes me working up to it. And so on and so forth. \n\nAnd I have 25 years of unhealthy habits to undo.\nI spent years legit HATING myself because I didn\u2019t understand why life was so hard for me. And I really internalised all the negativity I received at school until I believed it so wholeheartedly. \n\nThere is a bit of grief for me. Like I said - I was a smart kid. I\u2019m a smart adult. I\u2019ve lost a lot of opportunities, friendships, and trust because my brain and I haven\u2019t worked together properly ever. I\u2019m mourning a version of me that doesn\u2019t exist, and trying to figure out what parts of me are my disorder and what parts are myself alone.  Working out that so much of me is a coping mechanism or result of my ADHD has been terrifying and relieving and sad. \n\nMy meds help. So much! I\u2019m very grateful for the opportunity to get treatment. A lot of people go overlooked their whole lives, many people never receive a diagnosis. My medication is wonderful. \n\nBut it\u2019s not like an antibiotic for an infection. My meds make my life easier but not easy. I\u2019m always gonna have trouble with things, like memory or tasks or brushing my teeth. It will ALWAYS take me more energy than the average person to vacuum my damn carpet. But a year ago I never would\u2019ve vacuumed it at all. \n\nSo again - it\u2019s yes and no. They help, but only in the sense that it\u2019s easier for me to help myself. \n\nI hope that makes sense!\n\n\nSIDENOTE: another thing about my meds - I\u2019d possibly have to go off my long release meds if I wanted to carry children. \n\nI looked after my infant niece for a few weeks while my sister was sick. And doing that, I realised I would never be a capable mother. My ADHD (combo hyperactive - inattentive) manifests with a few things like emotional deregulation (poor emotional control really and intense emotions) and the object impermanence I mentioned earlier, the executive dysfunction\u2026.and other shit we don\u2019t need to discuss. But looking after my niece I realised that it wasn\u2019t just pregnancy I\u2019d be unable to cope woth, but raising a child. The work my niece took, with multiple adults in the house? I\u2019d go crazy. I\u2019d go super crazy. I\u2019d likely not be prescribed meds if I breastfed so what, 18 months minimum off my meds? Meaning I\u2019d be EXTRA forgetful/dysfunctional/etc?\n\nNow ADHD is different for every person with it and many people with ADHD are wonderful parents!\n\nI would not be one of those people. So my fianc\u00e9e and I decided we would not pursue having kids. We would look into fostering when we\u2019re older because kids deserve love, but the emotional and mental toll of pregnancy and infancy would be hard for a normal person. For me, I medicated? I couldn\u2019t do it. So that was sad but I\u2019m at peace with it now.", "That makes a lot of sense, although it\u2019s hard to imagine when you\u2019ve never experienced it yourself. Thank you for taking the time to type this out. \n\nGlad to hear your medication is helping, though the side effects do sound bad - a medicine for people who have issues focusing on tasks, that makes an important task like eating harder by taking your appetite?
