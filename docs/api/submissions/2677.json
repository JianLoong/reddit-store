And that it's not fair for us to pay for school for John who has almost the same discount as her and not for her. \n\nWe try to explain by saying that John's discount is low, but his tuiton  is less than hers, so these are different situations besides that next year he can retake the exam for a bigger discount. But that she could also try next year for a better discount, but that at that moment we couldn't afford hers, because she lost that discount because she forgot to sent projects. \n\nIt is a tense situation, as she is saying that we are playing favoritism among the children and undermining her in her most important years of school.\n\n Btw, the school is one of the cheapest and it's really good.
