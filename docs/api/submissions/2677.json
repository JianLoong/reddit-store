And that it's not fair for us to pay for school for John who has almost the same discount as her and not for her. \n\nWe try to explain by saying that John's discount is low, but his tuiton  is less than hers, so these are different situations besides that next year he can retake the exam for a bigger discount. But that she could also try next year for a better discount, but that at that moment we couldn't afford hers, because she lost that discount because she forgot to sent projects. \n\nIt is a tense situation, as she is saying that we are playing favoritism among the children and undermining her in her most important years of school.\n\n Btw, the school is one of the cheapest and it's really good.

What\u2019s going on in her life that made her do that, bc if it\u2019s just that she doesn\u2019t care then yeah, I agree, you shouldn\u2019t be bankrupting your household to pay for an education she doesn\u2019t care about but I def think it\u2019s worth looking into and really hearing her out. I started missing deadlines when my mental health became an overwhelming issue even before I was able to identify it as such \n\nNAH", "NTA. If she would have tried harder, she could have done it. \n\nSide note: Has she been tested for learning disorders/adhd?", "YTA.\n\nyou should prepare for your kids education long time ago, before having any child.\n\neducation is the most highest priority for children and they deserved the best scholl parent can provides.\n\nbetter school gave better survival chance on the real world.", "Finally, a top comment that makes sense! People actually want the OP and her husband to stop the others from going to private school because 15f was slacking off and failing so it could be equal/fair? That is not sustainable in the real world.", "To sacrifice a child's education and entire future because they forgot some projects and did poorly on a test is insane. \n\nI understand the need to teach consequences, but this is not the way to do it!! The children all deserve the same opportunities.", "It seems a lot of people here think that 15 is too young to be responsible for your schoolwork, and the parents are at fault for her failure.", "This right here, her job at this time was to do her school work. Punishing your sons because she chose to coast would be unfair", "A lot of people who didn\u2019t grow up low income take for granted their childhood privileges. They see those things as rights and they don\u2019t understand that some families straight up can\u2019t afford those things. OP\u2019s kids have to work harder than a lot of other kids to get a good education. It\u2019s not an ideal situation to be in, and it\u2019s not fair, but OP can\u2019t change the fact that the world is unfair. Sometimes you have to work harder than others to overcome that shit.", "I'm wondering the same thing.", "Thank you! Why did it take me sooooo long to find this comment. I was Barb in high school-legit forgetting assignments, testing poorly due to poor working memory skills/test anxiety.... didn't get diagnosed with ADHD until 2 years ago at 32. The comments about the girl are disgusting, saying she's messing up her education on purpose and deserves this.", "I don\u2019t think she deserves to lose her access to a better education, but if the parents can\u2019t afford it then they can\u2019t afford it. Not everything is so black and white. It\u2019s sucks that she has to miss out on something so vital, but sometimes life just sucks. They can\u2019t just pull the money out of their ass. It would be even less fair for the other kids to suffer because this one messed up, but just because she messed up doesn\u2019t mean she deserves to suffer either.", "Yes sadly this is what happens to poor and lower-income kids in third world countries", "OP can\u2019t change the fact that the system sucks. Lower income people like OP and their family have no choice but to work harder to get the same shit that wealthier people have. It\u2019s not an asshole thing to acknowledge that.", "Relax,  not everyone is American", "They don\u2019t seem to be in the US so a shitty school is probably VERY shitty and they are doing the best they can to provide for their children. OPs daughter lost a significant portion of her scholarship by being careless. Why should her brother suffer for that? NTA", "Translation: Only the rich get to have a good education", "So what's your magical solution here?  Barb fucked up and Op can't pay for private school without a scholarship.", "well, I don't agree with you, op has no other choice. What else is she supposed to do? She can not afford to send her daughter to a private school. Do you want OP to skip dinner every day so she can afford it? what other possible solution is there?\n\nI am from India but my family is upper middle class, no one who can afford private school, goes to public school cause the education is not good", "Finally!! I've been searching for the comments about simple solution is barb get a job to pay the difference in her tuition this year. She stays in her school, parents pay same amount and she's still taught an extremely good and important life lesson without and damages to her future or her emotional health (which at 15 is a petty big deal).", "Your math is wrong. Ethan gets 70% on what I guess is 1300 Barb used to get 40% of 900 and John gets 20% of 500. \n\nas for John, his scholarship is going to have to improve when he gets to a higher grade\n\nOp would have had no choice but to kick the oldest out of school because his tuition was the highest and if he did badly on the scholarship test then op would have to pay a massive amount more because they get 70 percent of johns tuition which would be around 1500 which is around 2.5times more than john tuition which is 500.", "Why? She lost the scholarship and now they save all the money.   \n\nDo you know how much energy it takes to do that after your own punishing shift at work?", "If I'm poor I'm not denying myself to eat, i just can't afford it. Same here.\nSure, maybe the daughter can get a job, but that doesn't really make OP the ahole at all. OP is trying their hardest to get everyone the same education, but daughter just effed up hard and that costed the parents a shit load of money. It's not like OP chose to simply stop paying.", "why go to the better school in general if she isn\u2019t going to want to keep her grades up? if she can\u2019t understand the importance of grades at 15 she can save her family the tuition money and go to public school.", "Op has no other choice. What else is she supposed to do? She can not afford to send her daughter to a private school. Do you want OP to skip dinner every day so she can afford it? what other possible solution is there?", "How can OP afford this if she is in a third world country and struggling to send her kids to a decent school", "Op can not afford it and Op is not going to skip dinner everyday so her kid can fail an expensive school.", "Unless she has adhd which a lot of places don\u2019t test for, especially in girls.", "I\u2019ve got an awful memory and have a habit of forgetting things, but these projects are obviously important. No reminders, nothing?", "is it about teaching consequences or is it that her consequences have caused tuition to become unaffordable to the family.", "Blame the school for making the tuition based on test scores. OP can\u2019t help that they can\u2019t afford full tuition.", "It\u2019s that there should be wiggle room for kids to be kids. Like the difference between 15% and 20% off a tuition should not be make or break. She\u2019s still a kid FFS! Maybe she has undiagnosed ADHD or a learning disability. \n\nIf B was failing multiple subjects and skipping class and stuff, maybe. \n\nBut struggling in one subject and scoring a discount that is almost the same as her brother\u2019s seems to me like it\u2019s worth continuing to give her the opportunity that comes from better education. \n\nThe punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime.", "I guess I thought if they were the type of person who thought private schools always mean better schools (lol, usually don't need a teaching license to teach private, don't need to hit the same standards as public, can get away with lying about sex Ed, etc), then they are 100% ta because they are saying that their kid deserves to be poorly educated because she struggles in one subject.  \n\nBut I believe they see private school as a class signifier, since they don't seem to think their daughter is losing out on much educationwise... And honestly I think they should fix that view and send all their kids to public school.  Because the assumption that private school is better causes a lot of people to neglect the public schools ... If they'd just give the public school the $35,000 a year instead of the private school, can you imagine?  But they would have to be okay with the poors getting an advantage too, can't have that.  And their kid might accidentally touch one, don't want to get diseased.", "Don't have kids you can't afford.\n\nJesus.", "Shit, I\u2019m in the US, and there are some public schools here that I absolutely wouldn\u2019t want to send a kid to, lol. Not trying to trivialize the struggles of other countries, it does sound like OP is in a much worse off place.", "honestly this isnt too far off US schools, you just only hear about bullets, decrepit schools is just normal.\n\nmissing or broken windows,\nno AC/heat in extreme weather\nmissing classroom doors\nrodent population nearly equal to student population\nlocked or non-working tolite facilities \ntoo many students", "yeah the high school education is much higher than the middle school education like 50% higher", "They didn't say she couldn't go to school, but they can't afford this one. What do you think they should do if they don't have the money to pay the full price? Sell a kidney?", "When her grades determine if her parents can afford her school, her grades become the parents problem.They need to be more involved to make sure she's doing well enough to continue going to that school. She's old enough to be reminded that they are this involved because if she fails she goes to public school, same goes for the other two kids as well. 15 is not an adult and if her grades did not directly effect the patents ability to send her to that school I would absolutely agree with you, but since they do they aren't on only her until she's older.", "Exactly what I was thinking!! I am a woman with ADHD and the slacking sounds a LOT like how I was at age 15.", "I don't have experience with ADHD, but from my understanding, it would affect her in school generally not specifically one subject.\n\nETA: Thank you for clarifying! There is so much misinformation on these topics, it's sad. I hope OP sees this and gets her daughter evaluated.", "I had a similar situation at 14. We'd moved back to my parents home country and with three terms left in the year I was told that if I didn't work hard enough to get a partial scholarship for the next school year I'd have to either go local or to a trade school. I spent the next 3 terms pissing about and ended up at a trade school. My parents just couldn't afford for me to stay private but they gave me the opportunity at least. I didn't resent them for it although I was gutted when my cousins got into the same school with scholarships. 30 years has passed and I still don't blame my parents. However it's obviously a different situation as this girl has siblings who are obviously successful where she hasn't been. Life isn't always black and white and hopefully this girl will grow to realise this. Its a difficult situation for OP though.", "THE BOYS SHOULD ONLY GET OPPORTUNITIES EQUAL TO THE WOMEN!! LOUDER FOR THE REAL MEN IN BACK!!!  ANYTHING ELSE IS MISOGYNY!!!\n\n/S", "u/TAmamaof3 is NTA\n\nWhat is one of Reddit's favorite Abbreviations?

It's the difference between 765 and 400. Daughter has higher base fees and a lower discount.", "This! My first thought as I read this was undiagnosed ADHD. It might not be, but if it is, she\u2019s not being careless or irresponsible. She has a barrier that\u2019s making it harder for her to succeed. Punishing her for that would be a serious mistake.", "You have 0 idea what you're talking about. The education system in your country isn't the same as in everyone else's. OP already said the public schools in their country are shit, and that really is the case in many developing nations (good education is seen as a privilege rather than a right). Hence OP wants to send all their kids to private school but can't", "They\u2019re not doing this to punish her, they\u2019re doing this because they literally can\u2019t afford it. And 15 is absolutely old enough to take responsibility for your education. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s in an environment where she\u2019s not getting academic support.", "And their parents aren't fucking rich. They can already barely afford to send her there yet she does this.", "If she's not interested in that subject it could be an issue only in that subject. She could be holding it together in the other subjects she likes.", "I have lots of experience with ADHD.  Oh the number of times I forgot homework!  And if there's a subject you don't like or struggle with, it's even harder.  Even as an adult I have trouble with certain reports/tasks, even though I generally like my job.", "This is why I didn\u2019t get diagnosed the first time I was evaluated. The psychiatrist decided that since I could concentrate on some things I couldn\u2019t have ADHD. \n\nBut that\u2019s not how it works at all.", "Not true at all.", "Lol my parents looked up the assignments online. Got the syllabus if there was one. Emailed teachers if they thought we lied. On the flip side if we missed an assignment deadline the gradebook reflected it and we had to still submit the assignment but for a loss in points which is better than a 0", "If my parents had to remind me to do my work when I was 15 I would have been fucking ashamed of myself.", "My parents never knew any of my assignments in high school. Actually I don\u2019t think they even was aware or ever helped me with any in elementary school. WTF?", "A gradual release of responsibility should happen as children age.
