They can't afford it. Where do you expect the money for school fees to come from?", "The daughter is old enough to handle her own shit. If the kid was 10, 12 even yea sure remind them. But Barb is 15 or 16. She shouldn\u2019t have to be reminded with two years left of school.", "I honestly can\u2019t believe you read the same story I did and somehow come to the conclusion that because she forgot to hand in her assignments(if she cares that little about her education she obviously still won\u2019t do well in private school) and despite having a tutor, didn\u2019t do well on her scholarship test, his two sons should be put into publicschool. \n\nEssentially what you are doing is taking two people who work hard at their studies and will seize the opportunity private school gives them and put them in to a public school where they will suffer and not do as well, and his daughter who does not care about her studies gets to go to private school and squander the opportunity given to her.\n\nI\u2019d love to see just how privileged of an up bringing you had to think that everything is the parents responsibility and the child shouldn\u2019t have to lift a finger to get opportunities other kids only dream off.", "Uuuuuuum OP did her part. She was involved, got her kid a tutor. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault that her daughter was slacking and ultimately has consequences to her actions.", "Read the post. It\u2019s affordable because he\u2019s younger.", "Me to but I don\u2019t think op will answer honestly", "This.  Not to mention this is the consequences of the daughter\u2019s actions.  She didn\u2019t hold up her end of the collective bargain, forgot to do assignments, and didn\u2019t want to take anymore scholarship tests.  Are they supposed to punish the boys for her actions?  That\u2019s not fair either.", "I agree, the daughter had the responsibility to turn in her work and forgot, and as a consequence she lowered her discount rate. And should have to follow through with the consequence for the following school year until she can retake the test. Why should John be punished for her not doing what she was supposed to.", "The impact of having John the 11 year old, who had the lowest scholarship score initially, wait one additional year before starting at the new private school at age 12 instead is significantly less burdensome than pulling barb from the school she\u2019s a been at since age 12 (unclear why starting a year later was ok for her but not John) . She\u2019s also correct in that this move will impact her college potential because she is 16 . The 11 year old spending one extra year at public school (which apparently was ok for barb at that age) is not going to damage his college aspects. They\u2019re moving her five steps back so they can move John one step ahead .", "She\u2019s 15. 15 yos make mistakes.", "The daughter had a chance to go to a better school, the younger son has not had that chance yet.", "And when he stays at 20% as it gets more expensive?  Is he going to drop to public at some point?", "A lot of people in this sub don't understand nuance. To them it's all or nothing. Either all the kids need to be fucked over or none of them, completely ignoring that OP isn't even playing favourites.", "I think an involved parent should have been aware of the assignments that needed to be handed in - and the disproportionately negative consequences of *not* handing them in.  Yes, the daughter is 15 and should be moving towards being independent, but I'm still surprised the parents let her away with \"forgetting\".", "Except that John the 11 year old didn\u2019t blow off 2 projects. Why should he have to suffer for homegirl\u2019s irresponsibility?", "This really is the best solution to OP\u2019s problem", "Right. And this is the consequence. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but her own. You\u2019re trying to bail her out by saying she\u2019s young but that means nothing because like YOU said, she\u2019s 15 NOT 5.", "As long as he does what he\u2019s supposed to do in school in doesn\u2019t matter. It boils down to the fact the the daughter didn\u2019t do what she was supposed to do. She slacked off. OP even got her a tutor and she just \u201cforgot\u201d to hand in important assignments. Why should her son suffer because her daughter can\u2019t handle consequences?", "Because 75% of the sub is teenagers who do stuff like this and don\u2019t understand consequences.", "Growing up as a middle child that was homeschooled, I can say when you got 3 kids it can be easy to forget one of their assignments when they easily have 4 or more each throughout the year on just one class alone. They could have maybe tried a little harder by letting them know the consequences if they didn't get the discount, but this is on the daughter more than anyone. She could have also hid them or lied about it, and unless they talk to the teacher derictly, not like they would know.", "Where were the parents in this?\nThe kid is forgetting assignments and both the younger students aren\u2019t doing well on the scholarship test begun aren\u2019t the parents helping support their kids?"]}
