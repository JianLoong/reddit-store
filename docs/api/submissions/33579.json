My parents want to do the same. I'm not talking about dowry, just gifts that they'll give out of their own will and love. My boyfriend's family doesn't believe in dowry and won't ask my parents to give anything.\n\nA few days back, I was talking to my boyfriend about marriage and stuff and he mentions mid conversation that \"we don't want any gifts or anything, all I want is for you to sign a legal document stating that ny family has neither asked for dowry nor taken anything in the form of dowry\"\n\nIn our country there have been a lot of cases wherein the girl falsely accuses her husband and inlaws in dowry related cases and the guy's family then suffers a lot because no one believes them to be innocent.\n\nTo avoid this possibility and to \"protect his parents\", my boyfriend wants me to sign such a document.\n\nI do not want to because him asking this of me seems like he doesn't trust me. I told him the same. That whatever he's saying seems to be giving off the message that he doesn't trust me to be faithful and good to him and his family.\n\nHe said that it's not about trust, that he trusts me a lot and believes that I'll be an amazing wife and daughter in law. He said he just wants to be precautious because people can do things which are unexpected of them when they're angry.\n\nHe also said that he had always been a paranoid person and this is something he's insecure about and would like to take measures to feel secure.\n\nI straight out said that if he can marry me with complete trust on me and my word that I won't ever betray him then it's okay, else we need to end this relationship immediately.\n\nHe said that since we're both adamant on our opinions we'll just have to find out some other solution to this because breaking up is not an option.\n\nNow it's been a few days since this conversation and I feel that I may have been a bit harsh. But my conscience still doesn't allow me to sign such a thing because it makes me feel as if there's a possibility for me to be a vindictive person.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1703267656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18okrca/aita_my_bf_25_wants_me_24_to_sign_on_a_legal/", "score": 567, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because that meets the definition of a dowry IF all parties consider it a dowry.  The only reason it ISN'T a dowry in this case is because no one is considering it a dowry.  But down the line, if someone were to claim it were a dowry, it would be very difficult for his family to prove their innocence.  The nature of the gifts and their timing along with the claim that it was a dowry would easily convince most people that this is what it is.  Dowry crimes in countries that recognize them are, as you know, seen as very serious matters.  \n\nNo one who has ever had a nasty divorce planned on doing so when they were getting married.  Divorces, especially nasty divorces, aren't things you can plan for.   They're things that happen.  And truly, no one knows how they will react in a situation until they are in it.  It's very easy to judge others for how they act in emotional times.  It's much harder to act right when the big emotions in play are yours.  And in many countries, it's not just you who could make these allegations.  Your family members, whose behavior you CANNOT control now or ever, could make these allegations as well and they would be damaging.  \n\nIf you really love these people, you should understand that this isn't about you.  This is a genuinely muddy situation that they wish to clear up so that they can have the piece of mind in knowing it will never be used to accuse them of a serious crime.  That's a reasonable request, and the document they are asking you to sign is nothing more than you acknowledging the truth of the situation as you see it.  It's not a lie.  It's not asking you to give up anything.  It's not questioning your word.  You're just going on record with the truth.  If you can't go on record with the truth as you see it in order to protect people you claim to love because it wounds your ego, well, I think that makes you a bit of an AH.", "Dude you\u2019re basically being asked to sign a prenup and they were considerate enough to include stipulations that means any dowry remains wholly yours, as covering a subject that\u2019s super common in your country.\n\nYou\u2019re basically saying \u201cbut he\u2019s preparing for us to divorce\u201d, and we all know that\u2019s not what it means. Being prepared is not the same thing as lack of trust; it\u2019s being prepared. If you and your entire family are as trustworthy as you say, it\u2019ll never even come up after being signed.\n\nYTA. Get your own lawyer to check it over.", "YTA. Prenuptial agreements are a fairly common thing.  If you \u201ccan\u2019t dream about hurting them in any way\u201d then signing a document that gives them peace of mind seems like a no brainer", "YTA. Yes, it's paranoid, but it does no harm.\n\nGenerally, people who get married never expect to get divorced. However, divorce statistics show that a significant percentage of these people were mistaken.

People sign prenuptial agreements all the time. This sounds similar to that. It doesn't mean these people don't trust each other. And, if you stay together forever, then this document never needs to be used or brought up ever again.", ">I want is for you to sign a legal document stating that ny family has neither asked for dowry nor taken anything in the form of dowry\"\n\nFrom your description, his family doesn't believe in dowrys and never asked for one, so the above statement is true. Why won't you sign?\n\nI gather that in your country, the woman can make accusations against the man and then his family has to return the dowry? So then this ensures that his family won't have to return a dowry, right? YTA.", "YTA.  He's asking you to sign something that is a statement of fact, and he has explained that it is to protect his family because, as you said, there have been several false allegations concerning dowry.  So it's not like he's asking for it without reason.  It's not a reflection on you, it a reflection on what's going on around you.  If you would never do something like that then you've got nothing to loose in signing, and in doing so it helps him to feel more secure in the relationship.  You loose nothing.", "Coming from someone who was blissfully married at 23, then divorced by 29, I don't blame him. He is right- people change, circumstances change. There is no downfall to you signing this document, and sometimes we have to do things to appease the people we love. YTA.", "Yta. He's the smart one", "YTA and you're the one with a lack of faith in your partner. Of course he's not asking you to do this for some nefarious reason. He's just being safe, and you're making it into a big deal by being selfish and negative. \n\nIf his parents are important to you, then giving them peace of mind shouldn't be insulting to you.", "This is hard for me to analyze.  I am not fully cognizant of the legal and social implications of dowries in your country.   \n\nBut I would like to suggest a couple items for you to consider.  \n\n1. A lot of people, like you, see a prenuptial agreement as a sign that one partner does not trust the others.   In some cases, it is.  But a prenuptial agreement can also be a way for a couple to think about how they want to handle assets in the event their marriage does end.  A prenuptial agreement can be entered into alongside other agreements like wills and advanced medical directives.  Overall, this can provide a framework for both of you to think about how you want things to work if something unforeseen happens to either of you.  \n\n2.  Your boyfriend wants you to attest that his family never demanded a dowry, even though your family is giving gifts.  He wants this concession to protect his family and his family's reputation in the event your marriage goes south.  It is fair to ask what steps he is willing to take to protect you and your family if the same happens.  Perhaps that can be part of negotiations.  Similarly, if your family gives you valuable gifts out of love, is he willing to stipulate those gifts are your sole property, and remain your property in the event of dissolution of the marriage?\n\n3.  Your boyfriend said breaking up is not an option.  That is false.  Breaking up is always an option.", "YTA, in her replies, she is saying that she is not asking him for any legal documents. Marriage is literally a contract between you and him that is legally binding. If you trust him fully amd you say that will never change, then dont get married then. Just live together without a contract binding you. Can't understand the line of people sometimes. Sucks for the guy that he even has to live with this.", "It could be argued that he's acting in a rational and protective manner, given the context of your country's legal environment around dowry issues. He's not necessarily distrusting you personally, but rather he's aware of how drastically things can go wrong in marital disputes, especially with legal implications. His request for a legal document is a pragmatic step to safeguard his family against potential false accusations, which, as you mentioned, have been a significant issue in your country. This isn't about lack of trust in you, but rather a realistic approach to a known societal problem where men and their families often find themselves vulnerable. In this view, he's not in the wrong for wanting to protect his family from a legal nightmare that can arise from dowry disputes, even if it implies a distrust in the system more than in you as an individual. His paranoia, as he admits, is not unfounded but a response to the realities of the legal challenges surrounding marriage in your cultural context.", "YTA. He has a right to protect not just himself, but by the sound of it his family too.\n\nPeople change, things happen and nothing is guarantee. You can be all in your feels about your word and all of that, but that will be cold comfort in front of the law in the future. \n\nIf breaking up is not an option (at least not yet), then be prepared that neither is marriage", "YTA just sign the damn forms. He just wants to be prepared. Your unwillingness to sign the forms really shows that maybe your family isn\u2019t trustworthy\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "I understand that westerners generally aren\u2019t familiar with the concept of a dowry but it is NOT a prenup (I mean, only if you want to be technical, we\u2019d say it is indeed a document signed pre-nuptials, but this document doesn\u2019t serve the purposes a traditional prenup does)\n\nAll these comments stating \u201cit\u2019s a prenup\u201d, you\u2019re quite wrong and thinking somewhat \u201creductively\u201d, not all cultures must fit into your tiny little mental box. It is absolutely NOT A PRENUP in the \u201cnormal\u201d sense. \n\nThat being said, OP, I\u2019m really not sure about what you\u2019re so worked up about. You claim you would sign a prenup but won\u2019t sign this document and that seems\u2026 weird. It\u2019s a document saying they haven\u2019t asked you for a dowry, it\u2019s a very culturally sensitive topic and there\u2019s precedent for them asking; shouldn\u2019t you be relieved that 1. They\u2019re not asking for a dowry (since you\u2019re not property even though it\u2019s culturally acceptable to ask for a dowry) and 2. Everybody is protected? \n\nThey\u2019re basically saying \u201chey sign this document which states basically the facts of the matter\u201d, and you\u2019re upset? You\u2019re not being asked to sign a prenup where they would literally imagine the worst case scenario and decide in the most businesslike, clinical way completely devoid of love what everyone gets if the worst thing happens to your marriage (divorce), and you claim you would sign a prenup but not this? Make it make sense \n\nYTA. Sign the document and move on with your life please. Or do you plan to make false claims in the future? Because that should be the only reason to hesitate about this", "YTA get a lawyer to read the documents first, then sign the thing. This is a known issue to you; it\u2019s appropriate for him to protect his family.", "NAH.\n\nDon't get married if you don't want to sign it. You talk a lot about trust. Every one of those guys who was wrecked by a false accusation trusted their girl too, and a whole lot of good that did them. It's easy for you to demand that he trust you blindly when you have absolutely nothing at risk over it.\n\nI hope your BF sticks to his guns on this.", "YTA.  So he wants you to sign a document saying truthfully that your family has never asked for a dowry?  Um...it's suspicious to me that you don't want to do it.", "Please read this:\n\nIF you signed it, make sure you have a copy of it so later one they can't use it against you that you didn't have any dowry; but they didn't ask for it.\n\nHave a copy and before signing it, take it to a lawyer.", "Culturally it's insulting af, which is why you feel that way. \n\nBut logically it's a way to protect yourself. You can both state the gifts you're coming into the marriage with, which you want to leave with in the event of a divorce. You can also include that if one of you doesn't turn up on the wedding day, that person will cover the costs. \n\nSince you know that sometimes they try to do a last minute dowry request, in order to scare the brides family into paying it or be abandoned at the wedding. You can include it as an extra layer of security, and make sure you announce that they asked for a dowry if they do it and you refused so that's why they didn't turn up.", "Get your own lawyer.", "Yta. Given the cultural and legal context, and the fact that it costs you absolutely nothing except for losing the ability to unfairly pursue his family in any divorce, its a big red flag that you refuse this I think.", "I would sign. All it is is the truth, and you are already ok with it.", "INFO: In the event of a divorce, does he have the right to keep any of the gifts that your parents are giving you?", "YTA\n\nIf you don't want to sing then start with convincing parents not to give any gifts of this type. Otherwise you are in an offside position. Another thing is that you won't convince a paranoid person to actually trust you 100%.", "YTA. As others have said, it's like a prenup (though way less than a prenup). He has valid concerns based on the information you provided. People act differently when they're getting divorced.", "YTA - the fact you're not signing means \"I'm keeping this option open\" when seen from his side.\n\n\"But he should believe I would never do it\"\n\nAll the men who had that happen to them believed it would never happen, and they also thought they would never get divorced.\n\nHe is not asking for any dowry. He wants a testimony that none was given. Seems pretty reasonable.\n\nSince there have been cases where it happened, what this tells me is that he is learning. A lot of men are becoming more careful because it does happen.", "YTA 100%. This is a prenup and it's totally normal and ok. \nIt doesn't mean he doesn't trust you, it's just a protection and if you don't mean to go scorched earth ever why does it matter?\nAnd the gifts could be considered a dowry, so. Yes. \nNormal. \nAgain, hopefully he'll take you back. If it was me, I'll say you just showed your true colors.", "NAH most of the responses here seem to be from countries where dowries and dowry harassment is not a thing because they keep equating it to a prenup. It's not a prenup, it's something else completely. The Western equivalent of this would be closer to an affidavit that he'd never raped her and he never would. \n\n Historically, the brides family gave the groom's family a large sum of money shortly before or after the wedding because the bride was seen as a dependent in the new household and the money was meant to contribute to the expenses she would add to the household or be preserved for the children the couple would have. That would be the dowry. Sometimes after the marriage and after the bride had moved in, the groom's family would feel like the woman's family hadn't contributed enough, and they'd threaten to treat her poorly (withold food, physically hurt her, etc.) if she didn't get more money.  That would be dowry harassment. This happened enough that the government created laws around it and women are supposed to have some recourse if it happened to them. If they report dowry harassment, it gets investigated but court of public opinion is usually against the accused until they're cleared.  I don't know what percentage of dowry harassment accusations are false, but i would imagine it's similar to rape accusations. \n\nAnd I can see it from both perspectives: from your boyfriend's perspective, it's pretty clear that it hasn't happened so you should see no issues signing. Otoh, it's kind of assuming that false dowry accusations are frequent and that youre the kind of person who might make one.  But, I think the biggest reason I'm saying NAH is because the signed piece of paper wouldn't really prove anything in itself. You're not married yet, so there has been no dowry expected up to this point. Plus, if you were being tortured, this would be exactly the kind of thing they could make you sign.", "YTA. I\u2019ll give you a very specific example of why this kind of thing is a good idea for you and him. You get married. Life is great. Love and trust. Kids. Why\u2019d he ever feel the need to have that signed? Something tragic happens, maybe a car crash. You survive, but you suffer brain damage and while you can function independently - you\u2019re not the same. Quick to anger, paranoid, maybe even delusional at times. Your husband seeks to distance himself and the children from you, especially after all the threats over the holidays when you stopped taking medication. You become hellbent on destroying his life, and by extension your children\u2019s. You make that divorce a nightmare filled with false allegations. The you today would do anything to spare him from that, wouldn\u2019t you?\n\nI know it\u2019s very specific, but it is a tragically real example I\u2019ve seen where a pre-marital agreement would have spared a lot of pain and suffering.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much he trusts you. Reality is, at no fault of your own you could become someone very different, someone you wouldn\u2019t want him to suffer through.", "Your refusal to sign it can be interpreted just as nefariously as you interpret his asking. Why, specifically, do you not want to sign? What are you giving up? He's getting peace of mind. Unless you are *planning* to claim a dowry was promised after the fact... YTA.", "YTA. Just sign the document, you are creating a problem here out of nothing.", "YTA with open to being wrong if I don\u2019t understand the legal situation. They aren\u2019t giving a dowery and he (or his parents) want a paper saying they didn\u2019t get a dowery. I don\u2019t see the problem. I understand that the gifts we\u2019re talking about are towels, linens, appliances, furniture- not gold bars and stocks. \n\nI personally have counseled people to get things in writing because even if you trust that person they aren\u2019t guaranteed to live forever. You\u2019re not just trusting them you\u2019re trusting all their possible heirs, AND whoever ends up in trust if those heirs happen to be underage. This is how it works in the US and if it\u2019s anything like that in your country he/his part are right to ask. USUALLY it doesn\u2019t go down that way. But I did have a guy lose half his business because he ignored my advise and his partner was dead and couldn\u2019t vouch that he was meant to be half owner. Heir got everything. He was young and didn\u2019t expect to die.", "Bro YTA, so it\u2019s more for peace of mind, you\u2019re turning this into something bigger because it really doesn\u2019t matter unless u do decide to do what the paper is afraid of", "YTA and not ready to be getting married.  At all.", "Sorry, but YTA.  You don't even have to think of divorce.  What if something were to happen to you, and you have children, but he moves on and your family doesn't approve of choices he makes after you're gone?  It's not unheard of for family to try and overstep/overreach and disrupt the lives of their sons/daughters-in-law to get what they want.  He's basically asking you to sign something that has been plainly stated.  Putting what's already been stated onto a legal document is not a hill to die on.  There are bigger things to think about and nobody knows what the future holds.  He's just trying to protect himself and his family in case something happens in the future.", "YTA\n\nJust sign the thing. Stop taking it personally because it isn't.", "YTA.\n\nSigning such a small thing contributes to their peace of mind. If you're nervous about any implications, show it to a lawyer.\n\nBut it sounds like you're not nervous about it, you just don't want to sign it because it looks like he doesn't trust you. That's silly. They're just protecting themselves against a situation you say is common where you live.\n\nSo I don't get your feelings about this. You were even ready to break up over it! If anything, your arrogant ultimatum looks suspicious.", "YTA, just sign the paper and move on. This is called being an adult.", "Wow. Yta.", "Yta", "Not really familiar with this but it sounds similar to a pre-nup. Your objection isn't that it disadvantages you but that it shows lack of trust?\n\nNAH, people change.

Red Flags!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll you have to sign is a paper that said his family never asked for a dowry? That's it? The only reason someone would NOT sign it is BECAUSE they would want to keep open the option to screw his family LOL.", "YTA, but I think the other comments have explained already why. What I would like to add is that you should embrace the talk about divorce, because it enforces you and your BF to learn how to communicate with each other properly, which is something that will benefit you for your entire marriage. This conversation, even if you plan to stay together for the rest of your lifes, will therefore increase the chances that you will actually stay together and that alone makes it worth it to talk about with each other. \n\nAnd another benefit, if you do get divorced,  especially when there are children involved, it is greatly beneficial for all parties if everyone knows exactly what to expect and will most likely make the divorce easier and quicker to handle.", "YTA.  It literally has nothing to do with trust but protection in the future.  If you are not willing to sign that form then you are giving off vibes that you are planning something in the future.  If I was him I would not be looking at you as a possible wife but as a future liability.", "I would say this is probably a NAH without hearing more details.\n\nBut from my POV, without knowing the exact state of the laws in your country, I'd be totally fine with signing a document of that type.  He wants to protect himself and his parents?  Fine.  Wise!  Nobody likes to think they'll break up but if they do it's great to have a mutually agreeable document, set when you two are fondest of one another, to guide the closeout of the relationship when you are not so fond.\n\nThe point, however, is that the document should protect \\*both of you\\* in equality.  Your parents want to give you a lot of stuff, your future husband doesn't want them to pay dowry because of potential reputational damage to himself?  Sweet!  Write it down that all of these items your parents are gifting you with remain your property in perpetuity.  You come to him free.", "YTA and from how you have answered comments and your initial post YOU seem shady and so does your family. It\u2019s a less hefty prenup and there is absolutely no harm in signing it.

However I do agree with his request Although now you feel as though your relationship is strong and secure, you cannot predict the future. This is also just like prenuptial agreements. Just because you sign a document now, that doesn't necessarily mean that your relationship will fail or that you're an untrustworthy person. In fact , you would show him that you were a trustworthy person by signing the document. Think of this document, also with things like a prenuptial agreement, as an insurance policy. Of course, no one wants to think of their home burning down, getting into a car accident, or anything else bad happening in their lives. But things happen. This is why we have insurance. It's good to have these things as protection. Although I loved my husband very much before our marriage we actually sat down and talked about all things that could possibly come up. We both signed a prenuptial agreement. It doesn't mean that we don't trust each other, but anything can happen and we are protecting ourselves. Now, this may not be for everybody. And that's okay. It's nice to have these options available.

My parents want to do the same. I'm not talking about dowry, just gifts that they'll give out of their own will and love. My boyfriend's family doesn't believe in dowry and won't ask my parents to give anything.\n\nA few days back, I was talking to my boyfriend about marriage and stuff and he mentions mid conversation that \"we don't want any gifts or anything, all I want is for you to sign a legal document stating that ny family has neither asked for dowry nor taken anything in the form of dowry\"\n\nIn our country there have been a lot of cases wherein the girl falsely accuses her husband and inlaws in dowry related cases and the guy's family then suffers a lot because no one believes them to be innocent.\n\nTo avoid this possibility and to \"protect his parents\", my boyfriend wants me to sign such a document.\n\nI do not want to because him asking this of me seems like he doesn't trust me. I told him the same. That whatever he's saying seems to be giving off the message that he doesn't trust me to be faithful and good to him and his family.\n\nHe said that it's not about trust, that he trusts me a lot and believes that I'll be an amazing wife and daughter in law. He said he just wants to be precautious because people can do things which are unexpected of them when they're angry.\n\nHe also said that he had always been a paranoid person and this is something he's insecure about and would like to take measures to feel secure.\n\nI straight out said that if he can marry me with complete trust on me and my word that I won't ever betray him then it's okay, else we need to end this relationship immediately.\n\nHe said that since we're both adamant on our opinions we'll just have to find out some other solution to this because breaking up is not an option.\n\nNow it's been a few days since this conversation and I feel that I may have been a bit harsh. But my conscience still doesn't allow me to sign such a thing because it makes me feel as if there's a possibility for me to be a vindictive person.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
