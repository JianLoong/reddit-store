Or are centred around how much you dislike them have always left a sour taste in my mouth.", "NTA but this is quite simple. Tell him to stop or you don\u2019t want to be with him. Can\u2019t be with someone who doesn\u2019t respect you and this crosses the line for you. \n\nEither he gets it and changes, or doesn\u2019t respect you enough to change and you have your answer.", "NTA\n\nAsking him to reframe from such \"jokes\" is more then appropriate. There should be no issue here on his end in my opinion. The fact he believes this will change him is ridiculous. Either he respects you and knocks off the \"jokes\" or he doesn't care.", "NTA as far as I'm concerned. \"It's just banter\" is way too often used as an excuse for offensive and hurtful comments, and it cannot and shouldn't justify everything.", "He's going to \"work on\" respecting you? I wouldn't let that fly. Don't **ask him** to start treating you with respect. **Tell him** he's not allowed to talk to you that way. If he does it, get up and walk away.", "NTA. Belittling your relationship and partner in public is not OK. He probably does mean it as banter, maybe his mates are single?  He want's to join in the \"fun\"  \n\nYou could remind him that at 25 you're definitely NOT stuck with him... Then wink, and say Just kidding...", "Persistent jokes and the contrast versus his behaviour in private could definitely have someone second guessing things, like is he actually just suppressing certain feelings and trying to live up to a certain perceived standards (of yours, when it's just the two of you?). Also, the \"banter\" really was in poor taste. There are subtler, less offensive ways to do it. If he's always like that, on some level he's making you look bad. I think it's perfectly valid to be confused and a little concerned. \n\nI could be overthinking it, but you're not being unreasonable? Maybe he's got issues. Banter should be fun", "NTA. Yeah these jokes are never funny. Ball and chain? Okay, leave. Don't want to be with me? Don't. You can't have it both ways - respect me and our relationship or leave the relationship. It's one thing to complain about particularly annoying things I do - a totally different thing to complain about being *with* me, when you chose that.", "NTA.  You have your concerns and you have personality aspects that may make you especially vulnerable to this type of behavior.  Perhaps he does not understand that aspect. I would try to approach this from the perspective of you understand his personality, but you need him to understand yours.  It is more reasonable for him to change to accommodate you based on your known personality aspects. \n\nBeware the ultimatum comments you are receiving here.  Ultimatums have this bad aspect of a limited set of uses and provoking poor reactions. They also limit your negotiation space.  A brilliant woman once explained to me that on some days a relationship is 90/10 while on other days it is 10/90.  Her summary was that relationships are rarely 50/50.  This would be a good issue for him to go 10/90 or better.", "NAH.\n\nHis humor was clearly appreciated by the community, he knows not to overstep boundaries, and he even had a conversation with you and he's right, it is in fact, \"just banter.\"\n\nIt may not be the answer you were expecting but it is the answer that i'm giving.", "NTA, and now that you have voiced your opinion it should never be an issue again. If he continues to make this type of joke then it would be time to consider counseling but if he loves you he won\u2019t hurt you like this again.", "I would say this sort of \u201cbanter\u201d is pushed on us from a young age. It\u2019s definitely shit but if all his other actions prove otherwise I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bit of toxic masculinity that\u2019s rubbed off on him and not his genuine feelings. Keep chatting about it and perhaps even seek couples counselling if you feel the need. But I see you and you\u2019re valid, as one ADHD woman to another that RSD can be rough.

Suffering may be his love language.", "NTA at all\n\nI feel this so much. Dated someone that would profess boundless love in private then would downplay our relationship in public. Same kinda odd jokes and brushing off key questions from others. It didn't last long after that. It's just not worth it, you deserve better and I hope you see that.", "I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re oversensitive or how the situation calls for any other judgement than NTA. I\u2019ve never been with a man who talked badly about me when we\u2019re around others, nor have I ever talked badly about any man I\u2019ve been with in front of other people. I can not for the life of me understand how that\u2019s funny, to me it\u2019s just extremely inconsiderate. \n\nI don\u2019t talk badly about any friend or family member when we\u2019re around other people either for that matter - isn\u2019t this common sense as an adult?", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not about changing him to be less of a jokester. My fianc\u00e9 constantly makes jokes as well, but they aren\u2019t at my expense, he\u2019s joking >with me<. He can say you two met during a Pok\u00e9mon tournament or farming oysters or whatever. It\u2019s possible to be funny without being a jerk", "NAH. *But* he could stand to be more understanding, even if he hasn't crossed the line into cold hard AH territory in my books. I'm taking the liberty of not getting hung up on the minutiae of single words, but rather the greater context. Your diagnosis is one that I'm familiar with being around and working with. Sounds like he means no harm, and just needs to get his actions/words in line with his private emotions.\n\nIt would be fair of you to reasonably ask for some public affection as reassurance when in public if he just cannot possibly bring himself to stop entirely if it really is just \"who he is\" \u2013 even if it's just his hands on your back or shoulders or something to start out easy. Sounds like the dialogue has started; let it grow so that he can appreciate how this behaviour hurts you (remember: \"I\" statements, not \"you statements\"). He will want to do better for you once you both start communicating deeply (easier said than done). He'll change as he matures too. Sounds like you both have great potential for a prosperous relationship when this is behind you.", "50M here.  I get where your partner is coming from; I've made similar jokes/comments on occasion.\n\nHowever, this type of joke has worn thin for you.  You expressed, appropriately in private, that you want to establish a new boundary and simply not have comments like this made anymore.\n\nDo I believe you are being oversensitive?  Frankly, YES, and I think your partner does too.  But this is about the two of you reaching a new equilibrium.  NTA\n\n* Now that you have shared your feelings with your partner, what will be your course of action should he NOT change/eliminate this behavior?", "NTA. Nor is he. It is just banter, and you\u2019re the only one taking it to heart. Nobody else in the group thinks less of you or takes it seriously. Basically all guys do this. It\u2019s a time-honored tradition. It\u2019s good you told him to please cool it, but comfort yourself with the reality that it was always banter and never meant to be taken seriously by anyone.", ">ingenuine\n\ndisingenuous, or if you must, ungenuine.\n\nYour boyfriend is being an asshole and there's a reason he wants everyone to think he isn't into you. If he isn't willing to stop and is fighting for his right to embarrass you and hurt your feelings in public, why do you even want to be with him? NTA", "Aren\u2018t jokes supposed to be funny? What\u2019s funny about portraying your partner as annoying? NTA, definitely, he SHOULD work on that and change that about himself", "You really don't need to cite a diagnosis in order to be entitled to not being pit down in public by yoir partner.\n\nFor the record, this does not make him look cool, it's really embarassing for him to crack the same jokes as a 70s sitcom home tyrant, it makes him look pathetic, uneducated, and weak, pretending not to love his wife and hiding his true feelings, as if she was an offensive porn collection.\n\nDon't let him do this to you.next time he says something like that, laugh, pat his hand and say, \"Don't worry, he knows how lucky he is that I took him in.\"\nPut that big old baby into his place, if it's just banter, then it goes both ways.", "NAH, but a couple things.\n\nFirstly, it sounds like that is just who your bf is. He likes to keep your love private. It sounds like he's just uncomfortable sharing what he considers to be intimate private details publicly. And when I say intimate private details, I'm not talking your sex life or anything-it sounds like even discussing how much you love each other is personal and private to him. That's not wrong of him, it's just his current character. However, it is hurting you, as you want to share those details and be publicly affirmed. This is really just a mild incompatability that it sounds like you had a productive conversation about.\n\nSecondly, and there's not really an easy way to say this-you ARE asking him to change for you, and I suggest you just own that truth. You seem concerned about what you asked of him, but in reality it is a small ask and you really seem to need it. It's great to communicate that to him, and small changes like that are appropriate to ask your partner for. You aren't asking for something big, and also: you cannot expect him to change completely right away! Give him some time to adjust, become comfortable with this adjustment, and fit into it. Be sure to give him the appropriate slack and encouragement, because change is hard!\n\nYour partner will also have needs of you, and will ask you to change for him, in hopefully equally appropriate and small ways. This is okay and normal! Be sure that you are also open to changing to meeting his needs too. Life brings change, you change and grow together. This is normal!", "Same, which was my biggest issue here. In his mind it was just cheeky jokes but in my opinion anything that perpetuates a negative image of your spouse is just lame and gross and unnecessary? We have chatted about that and I think he understands where I\u2019m coming from. Glad to hear I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way.", "Thank you. There was no issue on his end about being mindful of how his jokes affect me, so I\u2019m feeling as hopeful as I can right now about this moving forward.", "I've lived in the UK for 20+ years and honestly, the amount of gaslighting and straight up verbal abuse that they call banter is fucking mind-blowing.  And if you say anything or protest, you end up being the one who can't take a joke/needs to chill out/whatever. The worst part is that it's way too often someone's passive-aggressive way of saying what they're too scared to say straight out.", "Literally - why is that something he has to work on?? Respecting the people around me has always been something I\u2019ve intrinsically known to do, why does he have to work on it?", "Thank you so much for this thoughtful reply. He was very receptive chatting and seemed to be genuinely blindsided that I would take his \u201cbanter\u201d seriously. He makes cheeky jokes about his mates as well as me, so I think it was a good wake up call that the combination of no PDA with jokes made me feel insecure. He is more than willing to work on this moving forward, and I feel a little better knowing my feelings weren\u2019t entirely unjustified. Thanks again.", "\u201cAll guys\u201d doing something doesn\u2019t make it ok. Things being a \u201ctime honoured tradition\u201d doesn\u2019t make it ok. It\u2019s gross, old fashioned bullshit and I\u2019d hate it if my partner did it too.", "I\u2019m queer, it\u2019s interesting once you step out of the heteronormative sphere what you see! \n\nEspecially when you start asking questions about why something is funny. Subverting the expected norms and talking about how much you dislike being with your partner is a weird one haha", "How people treat you when others around is a very good sign of what they really think about you.", "Yeah NTA, he needs to start being around other men who adore their partners, it will show him how out of touch this kind of humor is. You are totally justified in wanting him to not express humor about your love life in that way.", "It just means no harm was intended. Intent matters.", "I\u2019m also queer! My partner is very supportive which is great, but I\u2019ve always hated that heteronormative ideal that it\u2019s normal to despise your partner, or make jokes about being in the dog house etc. \nwhich is why I really hate my partner\u2019s jokes, because it contributes to that gross outdated rhetoric. And believe me he\u2019s not like that and does not act like that, he\u2019s so respectful and a feminist at heart, so this humour is rather jarring and confusing.", "I don't know, if it isn't being received well or is portraying your partner in a poor light when you keep doing it, maybe you should stop", "Amazing! \n\nYes, I know a lot of my straight female friends just accept it as par for the course, it\u2019s all these little unconscious sayings that wiggle their way into the everyday vernacular!", "So, my 2 cents as someone who is heteronormative: I think a lot of us dismiss the outdated rhetoric, because the really fun part about it is antagonizing your spouse. There is something deeply fun and playful about annoying your partner mildly and getting a reaction out of them-but only so long as THEY'RE also enjoying it. It's not fun if they don't see the playful teasing as fun too.\n\nSo for example: I work doing software testing (QA) for a tech company. If new work passes my testing, I ship it. As such, if a bug makes it to production, people know I didn't catch a bug. Now, even though the software dev who wrote the code is also responsible, they are generally not involved in the final step of the release process-making it HIGHLY visible that I screwed up, but less visible that they screwed up. As such, at my company I have become known as \"One a Day,\" as in \"I release one bug every day.\"\n\nSome people might find that hurtful, but...I LOVE IT!!! I love the playful teasing I get whenever anything goes wrong. Oh, one of our product vendors is down? One a Day's fault. Someone else in QA released a bug? Probably One a Day's fault, for some reason. One a Day actually is at fault for the bug??? We got him!!!\n\nIt all comes from a place of respect, as I'm known to be highly skilled at detecting issues and very quick at identifying and rolling back problems. But mainly I'm a diva, and I like being the center of attention when something goes wrong. Can't get enough of it! There's something deeply funny about being considered the villain, but everyone knowing you are actually well-respected and very good at your job! And yes, it's actually reductive/ignorant to hold me responsible and ignore the responsibility of the dev who wrote the code, but I do not mind that. It's still fun for me!", "> I\u2019ve always hated that heteronormative ideal that it\u2019s normal to despise your partner, or make jokes about being in the dog house etc.\n\nStraight woman here. My husband and I both hate these with a passion, too. And I really think these jokes contain a grain of truth. ESPECIALLY when you've asked your partner to stop with them, and he doesn't."]}
