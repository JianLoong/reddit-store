Instead of her being the most important woman in his life, you are. Instead of her being in charge, you are. Thats the normal progression of a male into adulthood. Some moms accept it for what it is, and some moms don't. For some of us moms, our children are raised to be independant. We want them to find a good woman, get married and live a good life. We readily accept that as the mom, we will end up taking a backseat, in order for their DIL to take the reins. For some moms, the last thing they want is the day to come where their kid finds a girl and leaves home.

The behavior of the mom (as described by OP) is _objectively passive aggressive_ and should be of concern.

That is just fkn weird and should throw up a HUGE red flag.", "I kind of feel that it's similar to how some people don't understand British humor.

(Tone matters, of course.)\n\nWhen my grandma was on her deathbed, and she hadn't opened her eyes for over a day, my mom and all of her siblings had gathered around, saying their goodbyes, reminiscing, etc. At one point, one of my aunts, who had gained a significant amount of weight after adopting four children with various levels of special needs (she'd always been thin and super healthy before that), told her mom, \"Mom, I've managed to lose all of that extra weight I'd put on.\" (She had not.) Her mom opened an eye and looked at her and raised an eyebrow after seeing her weight appeared to be unchanged. My aunt replied, \"It's all from the waist down!\" (They were sitting in chairs around her hospital bed, so Grandma couldn't see below the upper torso.)\n\nAll of this was told to me by my mom, and it's classic humor for that side of my family, and I loved it. It put some much-needed levity into the situation. Other people would probably be shocked by the idea of making jokes while someone is on their deathbed.", "I truly don't think we can judge if it's *objectively* passive aggressive when the boyfriend who the comments are directed at doesn't think they're passive aggressive!!

Neither of them are capable of being objective.\n\n>Asking to see her son\u2019s GF\u2019s place before they were even living together\n\nI don't think it's that weird (especially since she only asked about it, doesn't sound like she was overly aggressive), especially since they seem young and tbh that's probably a normal reaction for a parent to have the first time their kid starts half-living somewhere else. \n\nHonestly to me it's way fucking weirder that mom still hasn't been allowed to see the place where her son moved. has he been allowed to invite her over?", "Saying, \u201cI guess I\u2019m not that important then\u201d instead of something like \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not taken seriously when I want you to be neater at home\u201d \u2014 is _textbook_ passive aggressive. \n\nSaying, \u201cOh I wouldn\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t heard from you all day since yesterday.\u201d Instead of \u201cI\u2019d be grateful if you updated me more frequently.\u201d \u2014 again is pretty much the definition of passive aggressive. \n\nOne way implies that she\u2019s been slighted without actually expressing what she wants/needs. The other way directly communicates what she wants/needs/is feeling. \n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t grow up in the 50s or whatever, but I have never heard of any parent trying to invite themselves over to their kid\u2019s partner\u2019s place. Of course it would be weird if they never invited her especially now that they live together, but I stand by my opinion that it is suuuuuuper weird for a parent to invite themselves over.\n\nEDIT: Also want to add that for a behavior to be passive aggressive _does not require_ that the person it was directed to perceive it as passive aggressive, nor does there need to be any aggressive-sounding language in the statement. I would suggest deferring to some psychology resources if you\u2019d rather not take a random person on Reddit\u2019s word for it.", "It's not passive aggressive if she's joking! Which her son says she is. Again, no reason to take OP's word over his.\n\nAnd though OP doesn't give specifics, she mentions that her boyfriend \u201ctalks back\u201d to his mother. So there's no reason to believe this isn't a part of a dynamic where they just say sassy shit to one another.", "Are you saying OP cant decipher between what's a joke and what's making her feel like shit? Bullies go to that, \"it was a joke omg you're so sensitive\" A joke involves 2 people, OP has clearly said this makes her uncomfortable but it's ok because it's all one big joke she's clearly not in on but we'll agree to disagree nothings fact here.\n\n\"IMO, it's really impossible to judge either way based on some comments (most of which are directed at the bf, not OP anyway)\" but yet here you are telling her its a joke and no reason not to take OPs word over her BF, also you must be severely na\u00efve to not see those comments were directed at her, he told his GF she was in charge and his mother said \"thought I was in charge here\" how on earth can someone not take that as a jab, it's such a strange thing to say", "You're right, jokes involve 2 people. The 2 people involved in the joke (mom and son) both perceive them as jokes and find them funny. If the jokes were directed at OP, the respectful thing to do would be to stop the jokes. But they aren't. They are directed at the son who explicitly agrees with them.", "Welcome to the rest of your life. Pick a different wedding dress than the one she chooses??? \"Oh well I guess my choice doesn't matter\". Naming your child?? \"I remember when babies were named after their grandparents\" \"Sure would be nice if Grandma got to hold you once in awhile\"...it's never, ever going to stop. My ex-FMIL was exactly like this. NTA", "Here's my 2 cents. There are legitimately some families who think this is joking, and that is normal and okay. But you do not feel that way, and your feelings are real, valid, and worthy. In the end, this relationship will beat you down because the behavior that makes you feel uncomfortable will be glossed over to the point where you'll believe it's okay and you're the crazy one. We call that gaslighting these days. You aren't compatible with his family, no matter how great he might be, and he's never going to be less a part of his family.", "NTA but sounds like you got yourself a mommas boy. If that\u2019s not something you want to deal with then I would suggest couples therapy. Start with it for yourself. Maybe some how to\u2019s on how to handle the underhand comments will help move things along. \n\nFYI him telling you that you look too deep into things is his way of saying he thinks you are being dramatic. No one can tell you how you feel. That is all yours. He can say I\u2019m sorry you feel that way and you two can walk through the situation together. Hopefully both of you will have an open mind. You\u2019ve put in a lot of time, I see if you can get clearer with the situation before you run.", "NTA\n\nYou are the one reading the room correctly.  Your boyfriend has experienced this his whole life and doesn't understand what his mother is really like because this is his normal.\n\nYou may have bigger issues than you realise.  Right now it's under control but wait till you want to get married (she'll want to dictate the wedding) or woe be tide you if you have kids... you will need to raise them the way she thinks you should be raising them and not how you want to.\n\nYou're going to have to have a very honest talk with your boyfriend about his mother and point out her passive aggressive words that she's been using towards you.  It may take him some time to actually accept what is happening because he doesn't know any different.  It's like his eyes needed to be opened.  So once you tell him, he might start looking for it.  Tell him it doesn't happen in most homes and is very different to how you were brought up and doesn't make you feel good about yourself even if he can't, yet, see that there is an issue.\n\nBut what you actually want to know is whether his loyalty lies with you or whether it's to his mother.  You probably need to come up with some scenarios to find out what he would do because she is going to try and make him choose between you and her.\n\nShe needs to know she's number 1 in his eyes.", "I like the way you think.", "I have this argument with my husband ALL THE TIME.  He will say something that leads me to think X, when what he meant was Y, and I was supposed to somehow know that.  I tell him all I have to go on are THE WORDS HE USES and that WORDS MEAN THINGS.  Try picking them more carefully!", "The only way to deal with someone like this is to play dumb. Just ignore her little passive aggressive rants and retorts and have minimal communication with her. When she asks to come see your place, just say oh it\u2019s not a good time. Tell your bf that you don\u2019t want his mom there as it is your private home, and that one day maybe you will host them when the time is right.", "Reading this I had to double-check 3 times that this wasn't my ex-FMIL. Holy crap OP runnnnn", "\"Oh you know how she can be\"...yeah, I do. That's why I noped outta there", "She's also toxic, and I would guess she's going to interfere a lot, especially when your relationship will start becoming more and more serious.\n\nAgain, I'm only guessing, but I think your boyfriend may have some issues with setting healthy boundaries when it comes to his relationship with your MIL.\n\nEdit: I misread some information and deleted a question.", "I agree. Bf's ability to fix the enmeshment with his mother looks problematical. I would have said doubtful, but the comment by u/Jilltro provides a ray of hope that, sometimes, it can be done.", "It could just be their dynamic as a family. A sarcastic family will have a sarcastic dynamic. That might just be how BF and BF mom communicate. Sounds like what I'd say jokingly with my dad. \n\nUnless we have audio or video to read body language there is no way to tell. So NAH. \n\nFor reference, at a time of my life dad would make jokes about ripping arms off and beating us with bloody stumps. Now see how bad that sounds in text form. There is no context or background. The worst is assumed. You would not know we were laughing or with relaxing and open postures. \n\nWe are passive aggressive, aggressive, and sarcastic and our bond is thick as theives. \n\nIn your family dynamic, that style of communication is not used, with OP hers are like yours. With mine it is, bf is like mine. Especially if hes saying it is not that deep.", "Same. My kid and I joke like that, too. We're both very sarcastic.", "Pfffft ayyyy. Gran was spicy even till the end. What a great lady. I'll pour a shot for her later. Mine was similar. aunt made food and grams had looked at her and said \" well if you made it, I guess you really want me dead huh?\" \n\nFirecracker that one. Wonderful woman. So glad I'm related to her. Our dynamic has always been the mix of sarcastic and passive aggressive. I miss her personality.", "Exactly. This is my 20 yo and me. I'm happy that we can play like that, bc i can't do it with my parents. Which isn't to say that we don't have totlly normal convos as well, and he can be very sweet and helpful."]}
