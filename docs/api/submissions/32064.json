But for a mid 20\u2019s man, they\u2019re just too much. \n\nHis mother is a very nice woman. But is well known that she\u2019s very \u201cparticular\u201d about the way she wants things. Another words, controlling. \n\nShe has always been very nice to me and includes me in every family event and holiday. Which I appreciate. She included me into the family. But I just feel like there\u2019s something off about her feelings towards me. And it\u2019s put me in some uncomfortable situations when my boyfriend will start to \u201ctalk back\u201d to her. He insists that they just have this joking dynamic, and what his mom says is completely more innocent than it is. \n\n\n- One day while I went out with his family, my boyfriend jokingly said \u201cYou\u2019re in charge here\u201d about a certain decision that was very minor like the type of beer we were going to drink. His mom comes out of nowhere and says \u201cOh. I thought I was in charge here\u201d super passive aggressively. \n\n- After he moved in, his family was asking me if he was really messy and a slob. I told them that he isn\u2019t. And I guess he was a slob at his parents home, and kept his room a mess. His mother said \u201cOh, I guess he just is a slob for me\u201d My boyfriend responded \u201cYeah because it doesn\u2019t inconvenience you. It\u2019s my room.\u201d And then she said \u201cOh ok.

It is completely innocent. Like, if my SO insisted it was a problem, idk what I am supposed to do?? Yes, I would be annoyed if they didn't believe me!! Sure, it's unusual or offputting if you aren't used to that family dynamic, but that doesn't mean it's wrong.\n\nAlso....it's not unreasonable she wants to see her son's new place?

It sounds like she does like you and wants to be on good terms, but she's also got some feelings about her kid leaving the nest and some resentment that she had to put up with things like a messy room and you don't. I don't think she's handling it in the most mature way and she's being passive aggressive, but I think that's pretty normal, tolerable interpersonal friction.", "I don't I you're an asshole but I do believe you are overthinking the comments his mother had made and reading meaning into them.", "NAH if it\u2019s between you and boyfriend.
