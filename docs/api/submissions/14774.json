Your mother doesn't want to trust you, she wants to control what you do. If she wanted to trust you, she would have reduced her control over time as you have proved sensible online. \n\nWe didn't allow our children Instagram or Facebook accounts when they were young. We would allow them now, but they don't want them after Insta was a major part of a school friend of theirs developing an eating disorder and ending up in hospital. Now they have accounts with Discord, Reddit and other things. I don't know their usernames unless they tell me or ask me for help with their device. \n\nWe were clear with them from the start what we don't like about each social media and what is good or useful. We explained the dangers. \n\nJust this morning I noticed a notification on my son's phone (he was showing me something on his phone, I wasn't spying) that said \"Hi, I'm Lisa\" and I warned him about WhatsApp scams where people pretend to have got a wrong number and  then want to make friends. It turns out it was a cartoon character in Duolingo, so he laughed at me, but took the scam advice on board. \n\nI trust him now to use that knowledge if he does get a scam message. \n\nAs you get older you need more space to develop your own identity, if you can't make small mistakes now, you will make bigger ones later. I see it as my job as a parent to train my children to live a successful independent life without me, even if letting them go will make me sad. I hope my trust in them will be repaid when they become fully rounded adults. \n\nYour mother is smothering you, and not letting you become an adult in your own time and you will end up hiding things from her and resenting her. You are NTA, but in over protecting you, your Mom is.", "It's difficult as the internet is seriously a cesspit and there are some major creeps on the net, so she's prob trying to protect you, but I don't think that needs to go to the extreme of reading messages between you and people you know IRL.  Maybe ensuring you aren't messaging with randoms would be the extent I would go. Certainly shouldn't be commenting on the content or the messages unless it was like bullying, or self harm etc related.", "NTA as long as it's normal age appropriate SM, which it sounds like it is. Parents have no right to unequivocally helicopter-pry into their teen's social media, any more than they have to read their kid's diary. She can broadly monitor your usage and ensure you aren't messaging strangers or anything.", "NTA.\n\n>She would look through my phone almost every night. Every text from that day, every picture, every post.\n\nSpeaking as someone who is more than old enough to have a 14 year old daughter and knows how prolific teens can be on phones, I'm in awe of her - how the hell does she find the time to do that?!  It must take her an insane amount of time.  Hasn't she got better things to do like cooking, cleaning, laundry, socialising, arts and crafts, walking the dog, gardening, talking to her partner, talking to your siblings if you have some, hitting the gym, studying etc etc \n\n>This leads to me occasionally deleting messages, for either my privacy or my friends. If either I or my friend is venting or anything of the sort, I delete it. If I don't, she asks me about it the next day and I feel like that is hardly any of her business.\n\nI don't blame you.  At your age you should have some degree of privacy.\n\n>She said she's just trying to protect me and wants to trust me, \n\nAgree on the protection part but if she trusted you she wouldn't need any of your passwords.  And this is the problem in a nutshell; trust.  Or a clear lack of it.\n\nI don't think she is managing yet to bridge the gap between having a tween and a teen.  I'd absolutely check a tween's phone the same way your mum is, but I wouldn't so much a teen.  By then it's time to loosen the reins little by little as you grow up through your teenage years and having an element of privacy is key.  She might as well remove your bedroom door for all the difference it makes.\n\nI suggest you need to have a chat with her about how this constant checking is making you feel, why you feel you should have an element of privacy, what she expects in exchange for that (maybe an update every day of what's going on).  If your Dad is in the picture or you have an older sibling or a supportive relative, maybe get them to mentor the conversation to keep it productive instead of it collapsing into a shouting match.  Suggest also that she should reach out to some of your friends parents (presumably she knows some of them) to see how they manage this difficult topic (and believe me, the idea of my teenage daughter being exposed to the internet scares the hell out of me and she's still pre school).  I get where she is coming from but think a different more supportive approach is required to enable you to develop your advanced softer internet skills rather than enduring helicopter parenting.", "NTA, you are old enough for some leeway. All she is really teaching you is how to hide stuff from her. Please know that what you mother does is too much, controlling and NOT NORMAL.", "NTA. But your mom may not be open to reasonable negotiation. \n\nIt sounds like she's really scared. That doesn't make her actions okay, but maybe it will help you to think about this as her running on fear. Every time she goes through your phone and finds nothing amiss, something in her anxiety says to her, \"it's only a matter of time. Tomorrow might be the day some predator tries to hurt your baby child. Don't. Let. Up.\"\n\nIt's not good for either of you. \n\nCan you ask her what would it take for her to trust you? The answer might be something you can't do, like \"give up your phone\", but it might be worth asking. \n\nAlternatively, what if you tried to set a boundary around conversations with your friends? \"Mom, I really want to have friends, and keep the friends I have. That means I'm not going to tell you about everything we talk about. Would you trust someone who had to tell her mother about every conversation you had with her?\"\n\nGood luck.", "Your phone has a private mode for the browser. Feel free to use it. It\u2019s a rock and a hard place situation, as their house, their rules, but yeah, you shouldn\u2019t be interrogated every day. Just make sure you let your friends know the phone situation as well.", "Just a little reminder that the mom wanting to protect him doesn't give her the permission at all for overstep his private stuff. She can bond with him and gain the trust in other way. Even if she, idk, sees with who he's talking, what's the necessity of reading the actual messages? There are other ways, you can ask and talk abt that people and give guidance, but what you win reading his private convos? A teen that most likely will not trust you", "NTA, but your mom have in my eyes some serious problem with this controlling behaviour", "Your mother has a serious trust issue. Once a month maybe but daily is completely ridiculous.", "Your mom needs to be informed about the difference between the words 'TRUST' and 'CONTROL' 'cause she sound mighty controlling to me.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Parents aren't entitled to know every single thing about you and your life. If your mum doesn't think anyone's entitled to privacy, I encourage you to get rid of the bathroom doors in your home. The kind of control your mum wants isn't normal.", "NTA. She is in the wrong in the first place. It was bound to come to this sooner or later. She needs to come to terms with the fact she both can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t try to, control your life to such extreme extents. *Some* degree of parental control is inevitable earlier in their kids\u2019 lives, and in fact, required. This, however, is dysfunctional, and not at all fair to you.", "NTA\nIt's understandable that you feel uncomfortable with your mom's routine phone checks and demand for passwords. While it's important for parents to monitor their children's online activity to ensure their safety, there should also be a level of trust and respect for privacy. As a 14-year-old, you should have some autonomy and privacy in your life.\nYour mom's intentions are likely coming from a place of love and concern for your well-being. It's not necessarily about not trusting you, but rather wanting to ensure that you're safe and not getting into any trouble online. It's possible that she may not fully understand how her actions are impacting you and your relationship with her. Perhaps there is a compromise that can be reached, such as regular check-ins instead of constant monitoring.", "I'm hesitant to really call anyone an AH at this point with the information we've been given so for now - NAH. But honestly - it's up to you if you feel like this is your hill to die on. I'd honestly make a \"Finsta\" (Fake instagram account apparently) and give her that username and password, follow a whole bunch of celebs and say that you didn't get it to post, you got it to follow Taylor Swift for all her Easter eggs that she posts - and leave it at that. \n\nI don't normally advocate for lying to parents. In fact, as a childcare educator I'm normally more \"Hey, no, tell the truth\" - buuuut, as the kid who had the parents snooping (just on facebook \"back in the day\" - Instagram was barely a thing then) and also hearing how my friends felt betrayed that things they had confided in (what they thought was just me) me about was actually me and my mum; it ruined a lot of friendships because they were like \"if we don't know that your mum knows about my crush on X, how I not know that your mum doesn't know about the night that... (insert bad memory here)/that I'm gay/something that is a friends story to decide who knows about not your moms\".  \n\nAnd I also only \"really\" recommend doing this if you know that not caving to her will mean losing all freedom and privacy and grounding until you move out type of thing. If you know she'll give up on getting the password and throw your phone back at you in two weeks, then obviously you don't need to go to such lengths.", "Nta you do have a right for privacy. Reading personal messages is not okay in any way.\n\nYour behaviour on social media should be monitored at your age though.\n\nMaybe you can meet in the middle. Let her look at your social media in your presence. You log in with your secret password and you can look at it together. Do set a boundary on messages though, but show her who you are talking to.", "NTA.   \nYour mother is a controlling AH.   \nShe doesn\u2019t trust you, she doesn\u2019t respect you, and you have every right to privacy. Stop giving her your password.", "My daughter is 14 and has the same issue when she's with her mom. Her exact words to me were 'I can leave my phone out when I'm here, wherever I want and I know it wouldn't get touched.' \nWhy did she say that? \nBecause:\nA) I trust her.\nB) There are bound to be some convos between her and friends that would probably scar me mentally if I was nosey about her phone.\nC) She's not stupid. \n\nI've sat down and explained about predators and scammers online. I'd like to think she's got enough common sense to come to me if anything dodgy happens. Kids need their privacy and independence. If OP's mom continues along this route, it's just gonna harbour resentment later down the line. Keeping your kids safe is one thing, totalitarian measures we're seeing described here are bound to blow up in moms face.\n\nNTA op, try and have a reasoned conversation with her and explain your side.", "wonder what shes gonna say about this post next time she checks your phone", "*I want to \"trust\" you by not letting you have a single moment of freedom or independence, because \"trust\" is definitely not having confidence and faith in you to do the right thing when I'm not there, it's letting me control every aspect of your waking life so you don't have the opportunity, regardless of your perfect track record.*\n\nNTA.

I don't mean that you really are an AH, but on this instance I say that you are wrong about thinking that you have a right to privacy regarding your activies online (again i'm not saying that you are a bad person I used YTA simply to say that you're in the wrong here)\r  \n\r  \ni'm verry to sorry to say this as I can understand how it can be frustrating to live under those circumstances. But Mothers and fathers not only have the legal right to monitor their kids\u2019 activities. They have a legal responsibility to do so. By refusing to let her have acess to your phone. You are activly making it difficult to monitor your activities.\r  \n\r  \nIt is not the same as having a private Diary, as a court expressed the fact that being online is the opposite of being in private.\r  \n\r  \nI would say that if she's reading your messages out of a weird curiosity and trying to overly control your life choices and dicussions to a point where it is unreasonable to say that she's having your best interest at heart then perhaps then she would be an AH. But that doesn't change the fact that it is within her rights to do so.\r  \n\r  \nBut what she's doing is understandable (from a legal perspective) as you are still 14 and it is her duty and HER RIGHT to protect you from the dangers of being online (and they exist as studies have demonstrated especially for people you age. And you MUST abide to her rules as long as you're a minor and that she doesn't do anything illegal to you.\r  \n\r  \nI would recommend you try and explain again how you feel about this to her tell her that some messages are private regarding your friends (so then delete them if you want) and if she still maintains her position that doesnt make her an AH but it just makes her a mother trying to protect you. BUt I would completly understand if once 18 you decided to leave home and stop talking to her because of that. Specially if once 18 she keeps trying to control your life. Because once you're 18 then you gain a right to privacy relating to your phone.\r  \n\r  \nI do personally believe that she's overly controling but then again, regarding the question at hand she's in her right to monitor you. You're free to form an image of your mother according to that of course and I think that perhaps she would regret not respecting your wishes in the future if this puts a strain that you're not ready to forgive later in life.", "NTA - we\u2019re all human. We forget things and you weren\u2019t intentionally trying to hide it from your mom. Your moms behavior and the guilt tripping is what concerns me the most. It sounds very toxic and manipulative. Share your password for now to stay on her good side but keep an eye out on this controlling behavior.", "NAH\n\nYou are 14 and you have specified that you pay for your phone so your Mum (and Dad?) potentially pays for it. Therefore, they can check it.

I bought my own electronics (computer, pager, mobile phone - good ole Nokia brick) with the salary from my part time job.  \n2. paid for my OWN telecommunication charges (separate phone line which acted as a modem line) with the salary from my part time job. \n\nMy parents figured out I was way too busy working and studying to do stupid things.", "NAH\nYou're still very young, but at 14 at least you have some actual idea of what's happening and a trust bond will never be forming by force. Your mom is wrong af, if she wants to protect you, she can do it by having convos about all the dangers and how to manage them, but she can't just claim that she want you to trust her by overstep your privacy. You're a teen, you NEED privacy. Parents like this are the reason of why teens go and trust in a friend instead of the actual parent.", "NTA because she is definitely overprotective and if she wants to trust you she's got to let you swim by yourself so she can see that you will survive on your own.

So now you see there are ppl more controlling than your mom. \n\nIf you want privacy - go old school and have a voice call.\n\nI think it is irrational for a 14yo to expect unmonitored social media accounts.", "I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d go so far as to say YTA for refusing to give your password at 14 - this is normal stuff parents and teens often fight about. You\u2019re wrong, and probably fighting a losing battle, but it\u2019s still pretty regular. And you are right that she\u2019s going way overboard right now with the every single night thing. \n\nI\u2019m going to give you some practical advice that will probably get the teens of Reddit downvoting me, bc their advice normally consists of telling teens to stand their ground & be miserable (and phone-less in your case) while silently plotting the long revenge of going NC in 4 yrs or putting their parents in a terrible old folks home in 60 yrs.  Not satisfying if you ask me. And definitely not goal oriented. But if you follow my advice you actually have a chance of getting the privacy you want from most parents. \n\nYour mom is reading parenting articles. That\u2019s where she is getting these ideas from. The threatening to take your door is a dead giveaway. So use that to gain your freedom. Spend some of your time on your phone, while you are still allowed to have one, reading parenting articles about the dangers of social media to young teens. Seriously. Spend a couple of hours reading expert after expert go on about how only a terrible or naive parent allows SM, but if you\u2019re going to be allow it, at least have the decency to heavily monitor during the really dangerous years (which you\u2019re in). Don\u2019t skip all the horror stories of irl suicides, kidnappings, bullying, cutting, school shootings, sexual blackmail and other SM related trauma that happen all the time to kids your age due, at least in part, to SM. Learn the buzzwords they use. \n\nThen, once you know where she\u2019s coming from you\u2019ll be ready to have a conversation that convinces your mom that you\u2019re mature enough to come to her on your own if any of those situations arise. Then she may feel comfortable enough to ease up. It may take a few conversations where you exhibit maturity and an awareness of the danger (this is where the buzzwords come in handy).

Would you say the same thing if OP's mum removed their bedroom door, \"because she pays for the house\"?

This is how you get a teenager to hide things from you and lie.
