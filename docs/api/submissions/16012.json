He does sports with school, but rides his bike so doesn't need a lot of rides from us. When he does need it, I typically take him.

It has gotten to the point of literally nothing. Food in fridge weeks or months expired. Gifts she received from Christmas sitting in the kitchen in March. When I moved them to a pile to make room, she says my responsibility to handle since I piled them up. Just an example. Litterlly she would go to grocery once every 10 days or so (curbside pickup) and cook one meal a week (usually spaghetti or frozen pre-made). Any action around the house became mine to do.

I am burnt out, and now staying home to take care of her is effecting my career as well. She finally admitted it, and says she'll change. But I worry she's just saying it to manipulate me.

She has a psychiatrist and therapist, and is on medications. But it continues to get worse not better (seeing therapist for almost a year, psychiatrist longer).

You need to have a sit down talk and get to the root of things.", "NTA. While it USUALLY sucks to kick someone while they\u2019re down, the fact is that this confrontation was a long time coming. You both may have agreed for her to be a SAHM, but the role implies that she was agreeing to take care of the child you two have and help out at home.

This will sound unsympathetic of me, but I wish my mother had protected me from my father\u2019s alcoholism so my advice would be to call her bluff. Tell her you love her, tell her you love your son. Explain that you will protect him, and prepare for a trial separation. As I said, it sounds unsympathetic, but I wish my mother had done this for me when I was a child.

What the heck??!!\n\nDude, stop changing her diapers, even if she is verbally abusing you.   This is insane.", "Not ideally, but understandably.", "Not mutually exclusive", "Could be.", "I'm sorry to hear that. I am in no way a professional, but if what she's doing isn't working, something needs to change.", "Everyone is telling you to get help for her, but I think you should think about getting counselling for yourself to help you navigate this awful situation (and maybe your son too, if he has been affected by his mother\u2019s neglect). If this has been going on since he was 11, he must surely have been affected. She obviously doesn\u2019t want help if she\u2019s willing to lay around in bed shitting herself because of a sore knee, but you have to concentrate on making sure you and your son are ok. Until then you can\u2019t help her.", "Medication for anxiety and depression is honestly a crapshoot and can easily have side effects that make things worse, not better. Is she willing/able to advocate for herself and say, if that is the case, \"these meds aren't helping/are hurting, I'd like to try something different?\" If not, are you as her partner willing/able to help advocate for her?", "Yes, get into couples counseling. Because you have a relationship problem, not a housework problem, and not an asshole problem.", "No doc in their right mind will endorse the use of diapers for an adult in this situation. Part of physical therapy for knee injuries is to move your body. \n\nYou need help. Time to trust family or friends and get help. \n\nNTA", "My 59 year old mother broke her leg in 3 places recently and can still make her way to the bathroom and around the house.  Your wife is just lazy.", "You need to take her to an orthopedist to get her knee checked. If something is torn or broken, just staying off it will not allow it heal correctly. Once they have assessed the damage-probably X-ray and MRI, they can determine her course of treatment- surgery, brace, ice/elevate/rest, and then physical therapy. If she continues with what you are doing, she may never walk right again.   My mom fell and injured her hip, did not medically manage it ( physical therapy), ended up with a contracture, needed both hips replaced, and did enough damage to her knees that she should get her knees replaced. Now she has to walk with a walker.", "I dunno man, it just seems like people are looking for a way out without putting the work in. \n\nRelationships take a LOT of work. It doesn\u2019t seem like your wife has done anything that warrants anything extreme. If anything, her behavior is crying for help. \n\nI feel like the best move for you as a couple is to seek help professionally, so you both can express what you need and hopefully get some much needed help.", "Correct, the first time she ever needed diapers was after the fall Monday (which appears to have been alcohol related though I cannot be sure of that). And I am still helping her with her diapers, food, fluids, etc. so not really dumping and running I think that was a bit unfair.", "Not only that, but if she's on antidepressants and drinking alcohol that can be dangerous.", "I agree with this person. You've been carrying not only the physical load of your relationship but the mental load as well. You need to be thinking of your kid and yourself for once. \n\nYour kid doesn't need to be in this kind of situation. He'll end up thinking that how your wife treats you is normal, and that he needs to cater to every partner he has, while receiving nothing in return.", "This. Absolutely this.", "This is the best response. She needs a job and purpose, you sound like the kind of man all women want. Attentive and caring willing to work for your family. It's so sad the woman who should be beside you building you up is dragging you down. You deserve respect too and to not be the relationship glue if she is going to be a flake.", "I agree.  It absolutely disgusts me to see the way people deal with men vs women in these situations on AITA.  This poor guy is breaking down right now.  He needs help.  Instead the wise people of AITA give all the sympathy to the woman destroying her husband and son.\n\nIt's sick", "My point is he needs a good strategy because he will be very exposed when he leaves.  He will face social fallout, and when going through separation he will need all the help he can get via evidence to show that he has done everything right.  Even then she will get sympathy, but at least if he prepares well, he can navigate that successfully. That is more my point.", "It's gotta be having an effect on your son that his mom is like this. even if he doesn't know *why* she's like this, she's completely not emotionally available to him  because of whatever is going on.", "There is a saying \"depression is a contagious disease\" it's true. I have been married for 20 years. My husband struggles with severe depression among other mental health issues. I battle it myself now. When you're living with an unwell spouse it takes the life out of you, and your life revolves around that person. My husband gets all the help that is offered to manage, he has taken control of his life, but it will always be there and he will always struggle. (he is a severe case) there are days I question myself on staying. I love him and I choose to stay because I see him fighting hard to maintain his life and family. He is thankful for the support. If he completely gave up to this level, I can't say how I would handle it, but you do have to think of your quality of life as well. Good luck to you and I wish you all the best", "Letting this continue is wrong.", "Go to a hotel for a couple night s tell her you needed \"a breath of fresh air\" as it sounds like you babysitting an turd. If she's not contributing care for your self.", "It shows up on our insurance claims so seems so. That would be a lot of work to fake it.\n\nBut don't know how honest she is or how much she implements of them though. They are her safe places I take that very seriously. But it also leaves me in the dark.", "I agree with this..You seemingly weren't at your best but people understandably reach the end of the rope sometimes with issues and express big emotions to bigger problems.", "True.", "Thank you for your concern. My son has a therapist. He has ADHD so he sees her weekly to help cope with that, school issues, and general counseling. He seems to get a lot out of it.\n\nI do not have a therapist, have considered it. I probably should...", "I know right?   I don't think I could go in a diaper if I tried.", "My 61 year old year husband just had his hip replaced and went to the toilet.   Now we did have to buy a funny handle contraption but that is part of the therapy.     I sure didn't have to clean any diapers.", "I have no interest in getting out of my marriage. But things can't stay how they are either.", "It also could be why they aren\u2019t working properly.", "Yep.  It stuns me how unbalanced people are on AITA.  The poor guy is breaking down and the kid doesn't have a healthy and safe household.", "Yeah, you can see he is being drained.  And the poor son.  What is worse is that this tendency to sympathise with her will continue if he leaves.  Despite holding this together for years, he will be made to feel bad and will be criticised for abandoning her.\n\nIt is really sad, but he has to do it and get a safe place for him and his son to thrive finally.", "You talk about all these supports in place for your son and wife. You start putting yourself in those spaces you deserve to be respected, thanked and feel blessed.\n\nI mean respect need to be earned not burned. And she's not earning you.", "Well I\u2019m glad to hear that. I hope things get better for you soon. Keep working at it and get some help. It\u2019s not bad to ask for help when you need it. \n\nIt\u2019s tough going through times like this. You\u2019ll come out better on the other side.", "That's the hive mind for ya!"]}
