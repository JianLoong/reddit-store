He does sports with school, but rides his bike so doesn't need a lot of rides from us. When he does need it, I typically take him. I asked her if she wanted to get a job or volunteer, she doesn't seem to have interest in that (we aren't rich but comfortable so don't need the money). \n\nFor the past 4 years or so what she does around the house is less and less. It has gotten to the point of literally nothing. Food in fridge weeks or months expired. Gifts she received from Christmas sitting in the kitchen in March. When I moved them to a pile to make room, she says my responsibility to handle since I piled them up. Just an example. Litterlly she would go to grocery once every 10 days or so (curbside pickup) and cook one meal a week (usually spaghetti or frozen pre-made). Any action around the house became mine to do.

She is wearing diapers which I change, while any last remnants of doing stuff in the house is gone.\n\nI told her I couldn't take her abuse of weaponized incompetence any more. I am burnt out, and now staying home to take care of her is effecting my career as well. She finally admitted it, and says she'll change. But I worry she's just saying it to manipulate me.

She has a psychiatrist and therapist, and is on medications. But it continues to get worse not better (seeing therapist for almost a year, psychiatrist longer).

You need to have a sit down talk and get to the root of things.", "NTA. While it USUALLY sucks to kick someone while they\u2019re down, the fact is that this confrontation was a long time coming. You both may have agreed for her to be a SAHM, but the role implies that she was agreeing to take care of the child you two have and help out at home.

This will sound unsympathetic of me, but I wish my mother had protected me from my father\u2019s alcoholism so my advice would be to call her bluff. Tell her you love her, tell her you love your son. Explain that you will protect him, and prepare for a trial separation. As I said, it sounds unsympathetic, but I wish my mother had done this for me when I was a child.
