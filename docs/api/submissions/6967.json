{"id": 6967, "submission_id": "1087o61", "title": "AITA for telling the truth about my half-sister did and getting her banned from the house?", "selftext": "My (F23) dad had an affair while my mother was pregnant, and he and his AP Jen had Abby (F22). My parents split, and my dad and Jen got together. I never grew up hating Jen and/or Abby (thanks to therapy since I was 4), but I only saw them sporadically growing up.\n\nMy grandparents (dad's parents) didn't take the affair well. Their relationship with my dad never fully healed. Jen was/is not allowed in my grandparents' house, Abby was for family events, but after Jen found out my grandparents were not giving Abby a trust fund, Abby stopped coming when she was 7. After that, no one in the family except me and my dad had contact with her.\n\nA couple of years ago my grandmother passed away. Jen didn't attend the funeral, but Abby did. After this, Abby started coming to family events with my dad again. The most recent of these was an extended stay at my grandfather's main residence, which is in Italy.\n\nIn that house are all my grandmother's personal effects, including her dressing room, which has remained largely untouched since her death. My grandfather allows me and my aunts to borrow things from her closet, but he's very particular about the state of the room being preserved. For example, we aren't allowed to sit at her vanity, which still has all of her old perfume bottles and photographs on it. We always ask before we go in, and we let him know what we're taking before we leave. \n\nSo, a few days before my dad and Abby were due to leave, I came upstairs and noticed the door to the dressing room slightly open. I went in and found Abby going through the drawers. When she saw me she froze, and I noticed her was wearing one of my grandmother's watches. Abby has been told not to go in the room, and to my knowledge up until that point she never had. I asked what she was doing and she stuttered that she was 'just looking', which obviously she wasn't since she was also wearing. We were standing there in silence, both unsure of what to do, when my grandfather walked in and went ballistic. He noticed that she'd move a couple of things in the room and was wearing the watch and this made it worse. He said Abby had to pack her things and get out and that she wasn't allowed back. My dad came back from lunch to this scene and there was a lot more shouting, but eventually my dad and Abby left to a hotel and flew back the next day. My dad is now angry with me saying I hung Abby out to dry and that I should have lied and said I brought her in there with me so that she wouldn't get in trouble, and that my grandfather wouldn't have kicked me out. I didn't know that he was going to kick her out and obviously I didn't want that, but I also don't think it was up to me to lie about doing something I didn't. My dad and I usually talk most days but he's replying to me sporadically now, so I'm starting to think maybe I'm in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1673350466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1087o61/aita_for_telling_the_truth_about_my_halfsister/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing you could have said would make any difference. And why should you take blame for Abby's misdeeds? If she's not supposed to be in there, then, she's not supposed to be in there, whether you \"take\" her in or not.\n\nYour Dad, however, IS a fool. Granted, his parental bias makes him kind of have to be one, but expecting you to lie for your thieving sibling is ridiculous.", "I know I shouldn't say this, but you have a terrible dad, OP.", "NTA. Your sister was STEALING and your dad is blaming you?!", "NTA why should you have to lie for her, she was somewhere she knew she shouldn\u2019t be. Your dad is an ass however.

Actions have consequences and the utter disrespect for your grandfathers wishes in his grieving from your half sister is repulsive. She hadn\u2019t even seen your grandma since 7 years old, there\u2019s zero emotional connection to her or her items from what it seems. Your grandfather probably also thought she was trying to steal the watch, which would also be my first assumption.

Your dad is obviously playing favourites here - maybe there\u2019s more pressure on that side to get Abby back \u2018in\u2019 with his family, but it really doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s his problem not yours.\n\nI\u2019m glad your grandfather could see what was happening in the moment and trusted you - shows what a good relationship the two of you have.\n\nAlso, your dad giving you the cold shoulder is so immature and manipulative. I know it hurts, but ignore him and let him have his tantrum and wear himself out like you would a toddler. \n\nMaybe take the time to check in with yourself around if these are the kind of people you want in your life for more than just holidays.\n\nSorry for the loss of your grandmother, that stuff is hard no matter how long ago.", "NTA You did nothing wrong, it is easy to see that you are not his favorite daughter.

She might feel left out becauae the unfortunate results of her parents actions, but this is not the way to fix that and she can be (at least partly) blamed for how she choses to deal with it.

You did **nothing wrong**, you simply caught her where she shouldn't be. Your father is unfair to blame you!\n\nBut man...I kinda feel sorry for Abby.

She was her grandmother too and your grandfather made a rule that excluded your sister from doing what he allowed everyone else too. You didn\u2019t need to lie for your sister. Your grandfather is the AH for excluding your sister. Your dad is the AH for saying you should have lied.  Your sister was wrong to enter the room without permission but she\u2019s not an AH for it.

While I don't condone cheating, she has nothing to do with her parent's actions and the way your grandparents have been treating her up until now is horrible to say the least. She is bound to be curious and even jealous in this particular situation. That being said, you did nothing wrong. Your dad should grow a pair and stand up for his daughter instead of asking his other daughter to lie. \n\n(english isn't my first language)", "NTA if you were caught off guard and didn't say anything. \n\nBut your grandfather is really shitty to a kid whose only mistake was to be born to a cheating father.

I think that Abby has probably felt excluded from the family her entire life and who knows what her mother taught her growing up to compound those feelings or how your family treated her when she did come to events. It would be easy to say she was going to take the watch but why leave the door open and wear the watch? It could\u2019ve been a moment for her to be close to the grandmother she never really got to have. And regardless of your feelings towards her or how your grandfather became aware of the situation,  it was not your responsibility to lie on her behalf. I don\u2019t know what your relationship with her is like now or if your dad is upset that one of his daughters continues being punished for something that was his doing but he was wrong to be angry you didn\u2019t lie on her behalf.

That\u2019s what it sounds like.\n\nSo your dad would rather you cover for his lying stealing daughter than let her face the natural consequences of her own actions?? Also he doesn\u2019t know for sure that you wouldn\u2019t have been punished/kicked out by your grandfather so it\u2019s doubly unfair that he wanted you to lie for Abby.", "NTA \n\nOnce a liar, always a liar it seems with your dad.", "NTA\n\nIf you had lied, you would have probably been kicked out as well.\n\nIt sounds as if Abby was seeing what she could steal without getting caught, she failed.", "NTA\n\nShe is 22. She made a grown up decision (a bad one) and she had to paying the price for breaking your grandfathers trust. \n\nGive your dad a chance to cool off, don't contact him for a few weeks.
