Planning the wedding has been stressful and when her Fianc\u00e9 died 6 years ago it was around the time they were planning the wedding.

I went over and was sitting with her as she was talking with him on the phone. This man had 0 remorse, was gas-lighting her, and on top of it he was humming and singing to himself as he was doing things around the house while talking to her. I was so perturbed by the whole thing because it was the first time I had ever heard his voice and how he spoke to her. \n\nShe is staying with him. He is not telling this other woman the truth but is going to break it off by Sunday. I told my friend I love her  but I cannot support this relationship because this guy is emotionally abusive, a liar, and has no remorse for what he has done to her. She says she still wants me to meet him before their wedding in May and she wants to make it work because she cannot go through the grief process again.I've told her I have no interest in getting to know this person and I am there for her but if she does stay with him I don't want to hear about it because my only response will be to leave him. I also told her I no longer want him to come to my wedding in October.\n\nI sent the invitations out a couple months ago and at that time she told me that he had said, \"Why are they asking so early, I'll come but if I have something that day than that could change\". Before I thought his response was annoying but assumed he was just awkward, but now I realize he is a jackass and I don't want this dude around. \n\nShe is asking me to be there for her and to prioritize my love for her over my anger for him but I don't feel like I can do that. If she does stay with him, I don't think we will be able to be as good friends because there is a big part of her life I have 0 interest in listening about.

Do not get involved any further. The only thing you can do is encourage your friend to leave the relationship and get therapy.", "NTA - Your friend seriously needs to get into grief counseling immediately.  She's about to make one seriously major mistake because she has never really coped with the loss of her first love.  You can't fix this, only encourage her to help herself this way and hold your boundaries.  Maybe having to face your reaction might motivate her to get help, but I have my doubts.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't want to go through the grief of a failed relationship with a liar & a cheater but will be putting herself through pure hell by staying with him. She isn't seeing that. Also, the grief of losing someone you love is vastly different then the sadness of a failed relationship. The two don't compare. If she is set on staying with him to avoid dealing with the hurt at the moment, then she is doing a massive disservice to herself. She lowered her standards as to not be alone instead of being happy. \n\nYou weren't wrong in what you told her. She wants a shoulder to lean on and to vent to. She won't be looking for advice because she already knows that she will stay. It is a situation where what you say will make no difference. \n\nIf she wants, you as a friend then she has to respect what you asked for her to not talk about him or their relationship).", "NTA.  Sadly if friend is determined and fixated on this guy there is nothing OP can do to stop the train wreck, only get off before it happens and be available once it ends (assuming they want to be).\n\nGuy sounds like a real AH.  I'll bet a virtual beverage he calls off nothing (or starts anew with someone else).  Also, that is luterally the point of wedding invites. You send them out way ahead of time to get people to save the date and get a head count for the many, many plans that depend upon that info.", "NTA. But your friend could really use some counseling to help with her dead fianc\u00e9. She needs to leave this guy or she will have a miserable life with him. You are not forced to be her psychologist so you do you.", "Oh gosh. You are very good at setting boundaries, and sounds like your friend needs a wake-up call. You did the right thing by offering your continued support, but asserting that you don\u2019t want him around in any capacity. NTA.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to be nice to people who hurt your friends. You did the right thing by telling your friend that her boyfriend is a dirtbag", "NTA.  You can love her and be friends with her and not support her relationship.  I'm in the same situation with my friend.  She'll be getting married this fall and I will not be attending, I can't support their marriage.  I told her I'm here for her and to contact me when he breaks up with her AGAIN (roughly the 25th time in 4 years, no joke), but I will not discuss him with her at all.", "NTA. If your friend wants to ruin her life by staying with this guy, then that's fine. But you don't have to watch it happen.", "NTA. You can still be supportive of your friend, but still not support her relationship. It sounds like you were upfront with how you felt about the situation and not misleading. And just because you have anger toward him doesn't mean you don't prioritize your love for her. The two of you have different viewpoints of him and they don't have to necessarily line up. He's not someone you want to be involved with, so kudos to you for standing up.", "NTA.\n\nYou're NTA for telling her the truth and calling it as it is. It might be hard for her to hear but you're right. Her bf has no issue in disrespecting her and of course, you would not want to be around to see that. You are showing her your love for her by telling her the facts of who she is dealing with. I hope she sees this soon and wakes up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you've set some pretty clear boundaries and balanced them against your love for her. I really think your friend needs grief counseling as soon as possible. You might also try asking her what if he never actually does break it off with the other woman and two or five years down the line leaves her? She will still undergo a grief process, trust me. Been there, done that. Only this time, she will also have an outsized portion of regret and anger with herself to contend with on top of that. Ask her if her beloved first fianc\u00e9e would approve of this guy for her. Would he have been angry at how he's treating her? Would he have chosen this bozo for her? She knows that this person is terrible for her going into this thing. Nothing about him is going to change and it's definitely going to get worse.
