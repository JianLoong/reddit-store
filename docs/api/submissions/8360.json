She's about to make one seriously major mistake because she has never really coped with the loss of her first love.  You can't fix this, only encourage her to help herself this way and hold your boundaries.  Maybe having to face your reaction might motivate her to get help, but I have my doubts.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't want to go through the grief of a failed relationship with a liar & a cheater but will be putting herself through pure hell by staying with him. She isn't seeing that. Also, the grief of losing someone you love is vastly different then the sadness of a failed relationship. The two don't compare. If she is set on staying with him to avoid dealing with the hurt at the moment, then she is doing a massive disservice to herself. She lowered her standards as to not be alone instead of being happy. \n\nYou weren't wrong in what you told her. She wants a shoulder to lean on and to vent to. She won't be looking for advice because she already knows that she will stay. It is a situation where what you say will make no difference. \n\nIf she wants, you as a friend then she has to respect what you asked for her to not talk about him or their relationship).", "NTA.

I think you've set some pretty clear boundaries and balanced them against your love for her. I really think your friend needs grief counseling as soon as possible. You might also try asking her what if he never actually does break it off with the other woman and two or five years down the line leaves her? She will still undergo a grief process, trust me. Been there, done that. Only this time, she will also have an outsized portion of regret and anger with herself to contend with on top of that. Ask her if her beloved first fianc\u00e9e would approve of this guy for her. Would he have been angry at how he's treating her? Would he have chosen this bozo for her? She knows that this person is terrible for her going into this thing. Nothing about him is going to change and it's definitely going to get worse. I hope she listens.", "NTA Show her this post and comments.", "NTA\n\nBut please don't distance yourself from her, she'll need you to leave this abusive relationship. She'll need you...", "NTA.

She needs professional help. You can't be it.", "Yep, there's no reason for him to stop when his fianc\u00e9 is a doormat willing to stay with him. This also wasn't a one off, he's been with her for a year... chances are she's the other woman at this point,  and he'll leave her anyway.", "NTA\n\nFor everyone hearing this story it's obvious he's a narcissist and your friend is headed for the grieving process whether she wants to or not. Try to get her into therapy. Do not leave her alone. Stay in her life. Do not let him separate her from her friends. Be there for her but keep saying your truth. She'll see the light eventually.", "NTA\n\nSupport and enabling are not the same things. Good for you. This guy sounds like a bag of d*cks.", "NTA Do not honor this mistake with a shred of validity. Any time she contacts you, tell her to get therapy because she is WAY deep in the sunk cost fallacy, staying with a horrible partner just because she doesn't want to experience a relationship ending again.", "Morally you would be an asshole to support her marriage. I tend to hate the tough love approach, but she needs some sense knocked into her. If I were you I'd tell her that I don't support her marriage nor will I participate in it. Let her know that you'll be there for her regardless of what happens with her eventual ex.\n\n\n\n\nShe deserves emotional support, but a good friend wouldn't participate in her wedding or support her relationship. Just make sure she knows you're there for her when her entire life collapses due to him.", "You did good. The ball is in her yard now. NTA.", "Nta. That is a bad man. I'd be worried about her too. She really shouldn't marry him. That's just scary", "Because you love her so much you hate him so much. We hate more the people who hurts those we love immensely. So yeah, I would do the same.

That dude doesn't love her NTA", "Your friend, by the sound of it, will need you in a big way, and you need to keep contact with her so that she has someone there when the shit hits the fan, as it undoubtedly will.\n\nIs there any chance you can get her to counselling?

Only SHE knows what she can deal with, and if you genuinely want to support her to leave him on her own terms, the best way would be to keep supporting her, keep being her friend, and keep reminding her that she deserves to be treated better than she is.", "NTA. Did your friend ever get any sort of therapy after her fianc\u00e8 died? Because her saying she can't deal with the grief is very troubling. She would rather stay with an abusive asshole who doesn't value her over experiencing a broken relationship. What happens next? He knocks her up and then she can't leave because of the kids? \n\nYou've already told her that you're there for *her*. Keep the lines of communication open, like you're already doing, and let her make this choice. It's hard but she is allowed to make her own decisions, no matter how foolish they are.", "NTA \nYou are setting boundaries.  You are telling her how you feel.  I did the same with my friend many years ago.  She knew I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to call the police if I saw the abuse.  It got to the point where she did cut me out of her life.  He had a record and she didn\u2019t want him back in jail.  But when I got a call at 2am asking me to pick her up from a gas station after the \u201clast time\u201d finally became the last time, I was there.  And she knew I would be.  Your friend won\u2019t leave until she\u2019s ready.  Hopefully she\u2019ll be ready sooner rather than later.", "My advice as a friend is to separate your love for her from her relationship, like she's asking you to do, but with a twist. You can't participate in engagement, wedding planning, advice in how to solve issues in the relationship because you hate him. But I would still try, if I were you, to preserve that love for her. \n.\n.\nA problem I often see in domestic abuse situations is that women become very isolated. They don't have friends who are willing to continue to be there for them, and therefore, when they're ready to leave and at the end of their rope, they don't leave. There's no one there to catch them or support them. \n.\n.\nAnd although none of that is your problem, and you don't have to keep friends that you don't agree with or that don't provide any type of benefit to the relationship, there may he a day when your friend sees this as the shitty and destructive relationship that it is and just wants someone to lean on while she leaves, but no one will be there. And she'll just be another statistic. And you might regret not being able to be there for her through that. But maybe not. \nReally its your call.\n\nForgot the judgment: NTA", "NTA. Prioritizing your love for her is exactly what you're doing. Is there any possible way you can get her interested in starting therapy if she hasn't tried it already? She has a lot to unpack that's going to continue to lead to her getting victimized if she doesn't do anything to address it.", "I did this with a friend once. She stopped seeing the guy and has since met a great guy, thank god. But our friendship has never been the same and will likely never be the same again. I often wonder if I did the right thing as our relationship is now irreparably damaged.\n\nEdit: By \u201cthis\u201d I mean encouraged her to leave her emotionally abusive boyfriend and tried to make her see how poorly he was treating her and how much more she deserved.", "NTA.  She is about to marry an abuser.  This is beyond sad.  Try to keep up the friendship because she is going to need your support down the line.  Also, if you can encourage her to get professional counseling, that is really needed here.", "NTA. And your anger for him IS reflective of your love for her being your priority - it reflects all your concern about the relationship and how she is being treated.  She needs to see that your anger for him is not anger for the sake of anger - it exists because you love her so much and want what is best for her, and she herself is not seeing that being with him is not good for her.\n\nShe needs your support (although I agree that your support for her does not mean rubber stamping him or the relationship). And she needs counseling, including grief counseling.  You see her value but she needs an outside professional perspective to help her see it.", "NTA, but tread carefully. It's clear you just care for her, but she may think you're being a jerk and not want to be friends.", "NTA. Your friend *needs to* get out of this relationship. I really feel like she is making a big mistake from what you\u2019ve described about this guy.", "NTA. I think many of us remembered our own versions of this guy while reading this. He reminds me of an absolute horror a friend of mine dated for a few years until he cheated so blatantly (and unapologetically) that she finally tossed him. While they were together he was rude, combative and dismissive of anyone and everyone and was just torture to be around. If this guy is at all similar, I certainly wouldn't want him within a mile of my wedding.\n\nI think the best thing you can do is just try to be there for her, while reminding her that you've made your stance on him clear and do not want to hear about him. I don't mean to sound dramatic, but if he's gaslighting her as you say and treating her this horribly (and coldly, re: her late fiance) there may come a time that she needs your help with an exit strategy. As hard as it is to have a firm boundary about hearing details of your close friend's relationship, that same difficulty might lead to her reevaluating if he's worth it.", ">she wants to make it work because she cannot go through the grief process again.\n\nshe is setting herself up for a freaking LIFETIME of grief. i'd be vocal about it too. she is a misguided mess that needs help, but real help doesn't come in the form of: 'sure go ahead & do what you want no matter how stupid it is' \n\nyou are NTA by a long shot.", "while it is surely sad for you to have lost your friend, try to take comfort in the fact that you were willing to sacrifice your OWN needs (wanting to keep her friendship) in the pursuit of trying to make her life better. \n\nmaybe she'll eventually come around, maybe she won't but you definitely did the right thing & should be proud of yourself for it. i'm proud of you.", "She is going to grieve every time he cheats on her. Better to end it now rather than cheat over and over again", "NTA. It\u2019s worth looking up resources on emotional abuse victims to get resources on the best way you can support your friend. You\u2019re doing the right thing: being clear with strong boundaries while still keeping the door open if and when she decides to leave him. That\u2019s when your friend will need you the most and also when your love for her will matter the most. For now, stay the course. And gently suggest she get counseling before she marries him to maybe help her come to this realization on her own. Good luck.", "NTA your friend needs to wake up", "YTA - you don\u2019t know 100% for sure what is really going on. She might gaslight and crap on him just as much as he does on her. It\u2019s your option whether or not to listen to stuff about it, and maybe your relationship has already changed. Don\u2019t take on too much too soon. Let him be who he is and let her love who she loves. Tell her you want to be there for her, but you\u2019ll need to wait until closer to actual day. Explain that you don\u2019t want to go to prison which you would if the Glock in your brassiere fell into your hand at the wrong time prompting you to blow his nuts off.", "NTA, as others have said she needs to get into grief counselling stat. I had a friend in an abusive relationship and it was horrible hearing all the awful things he said and did to her, every time I would listen, console, she would ask \"what should I do?\" And I would say \"you need to leave him, he's putting you and your children in danger, you cannot have this man around any longer\" \n(he caused her to have a miscarriage by throwing her down the stairs, was using hard drugs and openly having an affair)\nShe would say she'd think about it, they would split up for 5 minutes but she always, always took him back. It's horrible constantly hearing someone you love go through abuse.", "NTA.\n\nAn example from my own life:\n\nMy husband says my BFF\u2019s life is like a romance novel. \n\nFirst husband: after 12 years of marriage and two children, he came out as gay and they divorced.\n\nSecond husband: she married him on the rebound. I didn\u2019t like him from the first time I met him but couldn\u2019t put my finger on why, but I know there was something not good there. I tried to talk her out of it to no avail. I made a lame excuse for not attending the wedding, but she\u2019s not dumb and knew it was just an excuse. I felt that attending would give the impression that I approved of the union, which I most certainly didn\u2019t. He turned out to be a cheater and an abuser. Every time I called, he was sitting right next to her so we could never have a private conversation. He was that much of a control freak. Ten years of marriage and then he died, and nobody was sorry.\n\nThird husband: better than the other two, but again, ten years and he died. I found out afterward that he wasn\u2019t as nice as I\u2019d been led to believe, but at least he wasn\u2019t abusive, just controlling. (See a pattern here?)\n\nFourth husband: she\u2019s about two years into this one now. He seems to be the best of the bunch. Even her mom likes him, and her mom doesn\u2019t like ANYONE. I don\u2019t see any signs of a controlling nature yet. Fingers crossed!\n\nMostly I\u2019ve told this story to focus on #2 so I can point out that you can skip the wedding but still remain friends and be a support to her if/when it fails.", "NTA, it's always tricky to say this type of stuff to a friend because they are not always ready to hear it, but what you witnessed is just completely over the top, and setting boundaries for yourself re this jerk is the right thing to do.", "You are not an A, but it is difficult. I would want you to stay her friend, and tell her that he is garbage when ever she mentions him. Because otherwise she won't have many friends outside of him, and that makes her even more dependent on him... Tell her that you don't want to waste your time with him, but sometimes maybe spend time with her, so she doesn't forget what it is like to have a good time with a normal, not abusive person. The thing is that people in those relationships tend to forget what this is like... And that stops them from leaving even more.", "But can you be fully? If a person chooses to drive into disaster, how much energy can you set aside for their poor judgement?"]}
