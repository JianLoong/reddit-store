We have been there for each other and I really cherish her friendship. She got into a relationship 3 years ago and her boyfriend initially seemed like a great guy. They met just shortly prior to the pandemic so I never met him, and she shared that he is very introverted. I wanted to be supportive so I said I understood if he wasn't ready to meet her friends because it can be overwhelming and as long she is happy that's all that matters.\n\nLast year they agreed to get married. Planning the wedding has been stressful and when her Fianc\u00e9 died 6 years ago it was around the time they were planning the wedding. She would talk to me about how her partner didn't seem to understand why this was hard for her. I encouraged her to communicate with him and from what she had shared it didn't seem like there was anything \"off\" about the relationship.\n\n3 days ago when she called me saying that she caught him with another woman who he has apparently been in a secret relationship with for 1 year. I went over and was sitting with her as she was talking with him on the phone. This man had 0 remorse, was gas-lighting her, and on top of it he was humming and singing to himself as he was doing things around the house while talking to her. I was so perturbed by the whole thing because it was the first time I had ever heard his voice and how he spoke to her. \n\nShe is staying with him. He is not telling this other woman the truth but is going to break it off by Sunday. I told my friend I love her  but I cannot support this relationship because this guy is emotionally abusive, a liar, and has no remorse for what he has done to her. She says she still wants me to meet him before their wedding in May and she wants to make it work because she cannot go through the grief process again.I've told her I have no interest in getting to know this person and I am there for her but if she does stay with him I don't want to hear about it because my only response will be to leave him. I also told her I no longer want him to come to my wedding in October.\n\nI sent the invitations out a couple months ago and at that time she told me that he had said, \"Why are they asking so early, I'll come but if I have something that day than that could change\". Before I thought his response was annoying but assumed he was just awkward, but now I realize he is a jackass and I don't want this dude around. \n\nShe is asking me to be there for her and to prioritize my love for her over my anger for him but I don't feel like I can do that. If she does stay with him, I don't think we will be able to be as good friends because there is a big part of her life I have 0 interest in listening about. I have told her I care about her safety first and foremost so if she needs me I am there but I'm not interested in talking about anything to do with this relationship.

Do not get involved any further. The only thing you can do is encourage your friend to leave the relationship and get therapy.", "NTA - Your friend seriously needs to get into grief counseling immediately.  She's about to make one seriously major mistake because she has never really coped with the loss of her first love.  You can't fix this, only encourage her to help herself this way and hold your boundaries.  Maybe having to face your reaction might motivate her to get help, but I have my doubts.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't want to go through the grief of a failed relationship with a liar & a cheater but will be putting herself through pure hell by staying with him. She isn't seeing that. Also, the grief of losing someone you love is vastly different then the sadness of a failed relationship. The two don't compare. If she is set on staying with him to avoid dealing with the hurt at the moment, then she is doing a massive disservice to herself. She lowered her standards as to not be alone instead of being happy. \n\nYou weren't wrong in what you told her. She wants a shoulder to lean on and to vent to. She won't be looking for advice because she already knows that she will stay. It is a situation where what you say will make no difference. \n\nIf she wants, you as a friend then she has to respect what you asked for her to not talk about him or their relationship).", "NTA.  Sadly if friend is determined and fixated on this guy there is nothing OP can do to stop the train wreck, only get off before it happens and be available once it ends (assuming they want to be).\n\nGuy sounds like a real AH.  I'll bet a virtual beverage he calls off nothing (or starts anew with someone else).  Also, that is luterally the point of wedding invites. You send them out way ahead of time to get people to save the date and get a head count for the many, many plans that depend upon that info.", "NTA. But your friend could really use some counseling to help with her dead fianc\u00e9. She needs to leave this guy or she will have a miserable life with him. You are not forced to be her psychologist so you do you.", "Oh gosh. You are very good at setting boundaries, and sounds like your friend needs a wake-up call. You did the right thing by offering your continued support, but asserting that you don\u2019t want him around in any capacity. NTA.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to be nice to people who hurt your friends. You did the right thing by telling your friend that her boyfriend is a dirtbag", "NTA.  You can love her and be friends with her and not support her relationship.  I'm in the same situation with my friend.  She'll be getting married this fall and I will not be attending, I can't support their marriage.  I told her I'm here for her and to contact me when he breaks up with her AGAIN (roughly the 25th time in 4 years, no joke), but I will not discuss him with her at all.", "NTA. If your friend wants to ruin her life by staying with this guy, then that's fine. But you don't have to watch it happen.", "NTA. You can still be supportive of your friend, but still not support her relationship. It sounds like you were upfront with how you felt about the situation and not misleading. And just because you have anger toward him doesn't mean you don't prioritize your love for her. The two of you have different viewpoints of him and they don't have to necessarily line up. He's not someone you want to be involved with, so kudos to you for standing up.", "NTA.\n\nYou're NTA for telling her the truth and calling it as it is. It might be hard for her to hear but you're right. Her bf has no issue in disrespecting her and of course, you would not want to be around to see that. You are showing her your love for her by telling her the facts of who she is dealing with. I hope she sees this soon and wakes up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you've set some pretty clear boundaries and balanced them against your love for her. I really think your friend needs grief counseling as soon as possible. You might also try asking her what if he never actually does break it off with the other woman and two or five years down the line leaves her? She will still undergo a grief process, trust me. Been there, done that. Only this time, she will also have an outsized portion of regret and anger with herself to contend with on top of that. Ask her if her beloved first fianc\u00e9e would approve of this guy for her. Would he have been angry at how he's treating her? Would he have chosen this bozo for her? She knows that this person is terrible for her going into this thing. Nothing about him is going to change and it's definitely going to get worse. I hope she listens.", "NTA Show her this post and comments.", "NTA\n\nBut please don't distance yourself from her, she'll need you to leave this abusive relationship. She'll need you...", "NTA. A good friend gives good advice, no matter how it will be recieved.", "NTA. The friend is mentally unstable for her desperation in searching for \"lust\" in an abusive partner. She needs professional help. You can't be it.", "Yep, there's no reason for him to stop when his fianc\u00e9 is a doormat willing to stay with him. This also wasn't a one off, he's been with her for a year... chances are she's the other woman at this point,  and he'll leave her anyway.", "NTA\n\nFor everyone hearing this story it's obvious he's a narcissist and your friend is headed for the grieving process whether she wants to or not. Try to get her into therapy. Do not leave her alone. Stay in her life. Do not let him separate her from her friends. Be there for her but keep saying your truth. She'll see the light eventually.", "NTA\n\nSupport and enabling are not the same things. Good for you. This guy sounds like a bag of d*cks.", "NTA Do not honor this mistake with a shred of validity. Any time she contacts you, tell her to get therapy because she is WAY deep in the sunk cost fallacy, staying with a horrible partner just because she doesn't want to experience a relationship ending again.", "Morally you would be an asshole to support her marriage. I tend to hate the tough love approach, but she needs some sense knocked into her. If I were you I'd tell her that I don't support her marriage nor will I participate in it. Let her know that you'll be there for her regardless of what happens with her eventual ex.\n\n\n\n\nShe deserves emotional support, but a good friend wouldn't participate in her wedding or support her relationship. Just make sure she knows you're there for her when her entire life collapses due to him.", "You did good. The ball is in her yard now. NTA.", "Nta. That is a bad man. I'd be worried about her too. She really shouldn't marry him. That's just scary", "Because you love her so much you hate him so much. We hate more the people who hurts those we love immensely. So yeah, I would do the same. Your friend needs some professional help though. Same woman for a whole year? That dude doesn't love her NTA", "Your friend, by the sound of it, will need you in a big way, and you need to keep contact with her so that she has someone there when the shit hits the fan, as it undoubtedly will.\n\nIs there any chance you can get her to counselling? Maybe by saying that she needs to deal with the grief over her fianc\u00e9 before she can commit fully to this man?\n\nNTA for not approving but keep communications open.", "NAH for not supporting her relationship, but please consider that by distancing yourself from her you are giving him exactly what he wants - an isolated partner without a reasonable sounding board.\n\nYour friend is being abused, and the abuse has likely been escalating over the last 3 years with pandemic allowing the fiance a more isolated environment to successfully manipulate her.\n\nHis remark about you wedding was him intentionally playing down the importance of her friendships, and if you see her less/refuse to acknowledge her relationship, he's succeeding in isolating her from her friends.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you telling her what you think and encouraging her to leave, but it would be shitty to punish her for not dealing with her situation exactly how YOU think she should.\n\nLeaving him immediately may not be safe, and may cause her more stress/pain/grief than she can cope with. Only SHE knows what she can deal with, and if you genuinely want to support her to leave him on her own terms, the best way would be to keep supporting her, keep being her friend, and keep reminding her that she deserves to be treated better than she is.", "NTA. Did your friend ever get any sort of therapy after her fianc\u00e8 died? Because her saying she can't deal with the grief is very troubling. She would rather stay with an abusive asshole who doesn't value her over experiencing a broken relationship. What happens next? He knocks her up and then she can't leave because of the kids? \n\nYou've already told her that you're there for *her*. Keep the lines of communication open, like you're already doing, and let her make this choice. It's hard but she is allowed to make her own decisions, no matter how foolish they are.", "NTA \nYou are setting boundaries.  You are telling her how you feel.  I did the same with my friend many years ago.  She knew I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to call the police if I saw the abuse.  It got to the point where she did cut me out of her life.  He had a record and she didn\u2019t want him back in jail.  But when I got a call at 2am asking me to pick her up from a gas station after the \u201clast time\u201d finally became the last time, I was there.  And she knew I would be.  Your friend won\u2019t leave until she\u2019s ready.  Hopefully she\u2019ll be ready sooner rather than later.", "My advice as a friend is to separate your love for her from her relationship, like she's asking you to do, but with a twist. You can't participate in engagement, wedding planning, advice in how to solve issues in the relationship because you hate him. But I would still try, if I were you, to preserve that love for her. \n.\n.\nA problem I often see in domestic abuse situations is that women become very isolated. They don't have friends who are willing to continue to be there for them, and therefore, when they're ready to leave and at the end of their rope, they don't leave. There's no one there to catch them or support them. \n.\n.\nAnd although none of that is your problem, and you don't have to keep friends that you don't agree with or that don't provide any type of benefit to the relationship, there may he a day when your friend sees this as the shitty and destructive relationship that it is and just wants someone to lean on while she leaves, but no one will be there. And she'll just be another statistic. And you might regret not being able to be there for her through that. But maybe not. \nReally its your call.\n\nForgot the judgment: NTA", "NTA. Prioritizing your love for her is exactly what you're doing. Is there any possible way you can get her interested in starting therapy if she hasn't tried it already? She has a lot to unpack that's going to continue to lead to her getting victimized if she doesn't do anything to address it."]}
