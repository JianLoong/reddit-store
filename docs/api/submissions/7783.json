Not being there is her being excluded, which at this point sounds like her best option. \n\nHer perspective is way off. She is young so I do believe she deserves grace and compassion while navigating this undeniably toxic behavior. She is acting as if it's her world and everyone, including the boyfriend (the REASON for the celebratory meal), is just living in it.

Is this the first time she's displayed this kind of behavior? \n\nNTA for anything you said to your daughter. Everything you said to her was reasonable and logical. The reason there is an issue is because your daughter is not thinking reasonably or logically. Also, treating your son's boyfriend to a meal to celebrate him is so nice of you to offer.
