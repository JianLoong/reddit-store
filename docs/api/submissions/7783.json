Not being there is her being excluded, which at this point sounds like her best option. \n\nHer perspective is way off. She is young so I do believe she deserves grace and compassion while navigating this undeniably toxic behavior. She is acting as if it's her world and everyone, including the boyfriend (the REASON for the celebratory meal), is just living in it.

It\u2019d be like ordering a spinach side for dinner.", "Yes. And OP could always call and ask what options they have because they may have a couple of options off menu.

She sounds like she needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her.", "I think this is a NAH. First I just want to note if your daughter doesn't like fish she's probably not going to like a seaweed salad, beyond that seaweed salads are traditionally appetizers. If the place the bf picked *really* doesn't have any other options (which is wild) why not ask him if there's another sushi place with more options that he'd also enjoy? Just explain the situation, he'd probably understand. Or as someone else suggested, why not let your daughter stay home and order in from her favorite place?", "NTA but the 16 yr. old sure seems to be on her way to being an AH.", "You need to remind her it's not for her benefit and she can stay home and make her own dinner if she's not keen.\n\nNTA.", "As someone who hates fish, I feel for your daughter. I've been dragged out for sushi before, and from my experience, it they have something there that's not fish, it tastes like fish just from being prepped around all the other fish.", "NTA.

Smh", "NTA", "NTA.   \nevery sushi restaurant I've ever been also has things like chicken teriyaki, rice ect, not that hard to pick something that isn't fish; she sounds entitled and needs to learn that the world doesn't revolve around her.  \nNot her day, if she complains then she can just not go.", "NTA. My SIL is a longtime vegetarian and when she was a teenager, she lived with us and she\u2019d throw little fits like this. Like, getting to a restaurant and whining that she couldn\u2019t eat anything. We had to point out that she could order the chicken pasta without the chicken or whatever. We would also point out that it was her choice to not eat meat and, while we were supportive of her choice, the world is not going to revolve around her preferences, so if she\u2019s unsure of food options somewhere, it\u2019s her job to Google the menu, eat beforehand, have a snack in her purse, or ask the server about vegetarian options.", "NTA. Picky eating is a kid thing. She didn\u2019t have to go, didn\u2019t have to order, or ate before she left. The meal was to honor your sons in laws new job, not her.

It's about celebrating someone else and she needs to learn to be gracious. \n\nNTA", "YTA for suggestion just eat the salad or eating before your daughter could have just not gone to the restaurant or just not eaten at all so I would say both of you are in the wrong and just leave the daughter at home with a twenty to order pizza", "NTA", "NTA.

Also, cool of you to celebrate your son's boyfriend's celebration!", "NTA\n\nShe may not KNOW.whatntue non-fish options are, but there will be some. \n\nAnd if all she gets to eat is rice and soy sauce, you can swing through the.drive through for her on the way home.", "NTA. My GF hates fish as well but actually loves sushi restaurants because of all the vegetarian sushi options that most places have as well as being a big fan of edamame. I find it very strange that this place doesn't have some non fish sushi options but maybe it's a small niche place. Either way you are correct that other people's celebrations don't need to cater to her. She is 16, well past time to learn that you don't always get what you want and have to suck it up once in a while. If she truly finds everything on the menu repulsive then I guess she doesn't have to go but make sure she knows that she is telling her brother that he is less important to her than her being able to throw a tantrum about not getting exactly what she wants on someone else's special day.", "NTA.\n\nConsidering rolls like avocado, cucumber, sweet potato are established standards at any sushi restaurant worth their salt, I really want to see this menu for myself.", "NTA", "NTA. You offered him his pick to celebrate, and when it is her turn for you to do something similar for her, she gets to choose for herself.  She does not get to pick what makes other people happy, just herself.", "NTA. I think this is a perfect learning opportunity for her to understand, like you said, that other people's celebrations don't have to cater to them.

Teenagers can be so self centered & it unfortunately sounds like your ex is encouraging this behavior in your daughter to get back at you, which is sad.", ">She said that was excluding her, and told me to tell her brother to have his boyfriend pick a different restaurant.\n\nLOL, F no!, you don't ask the guest of honor to change his choice just because she doesn't like the food, she can stay home or you can buy her something else on the way to the sushi place but her demand is ridiculous and immature.\n\nNTA, your daughter needs to grow up and learn that the world doesn't revolve around her.", "Seaweed salad can be an acquired taste.

But when you go look for it, it\u2019s magically exactly where you said it\u2019d be. \n\nBecause you\u2019re right. It\u2019s hard to imagine that a sushi restaurant would have nothing that didn\u2019t have fish. Most can do some sort of hibachi if not in front of you, in the kitchen. And you can get no fish in that.", "California roll.", "I hate fish too but most sushi places have either beef or chicken available on their menu. Tofu is a major component of sushi. So she can suck it up with mismo soup or suck on the glass of tea. And pick up McDonald's on the way home.

Where's the beef tataki, the karrage chicken, the omurice?", "Having any of these things on the menu is inversely correlated with quality at a sushi restaurant.", "> basic kids menu?\n\nRight?

It's literally just a slice of sweetened scrambled egg on rice and it's usually one of the cheaper options as well. Is miso soup so weird (yes it contains some fish in the broth but it's...mainly just salty bean broth)? What about bites of fried chicken (karaage)? Most sushi menu appetizers aren't raw...although on the other hand, depending on the menu/restaurant, it might not explain all the terms or dish names well enough for someone new to sushi so non-fish options might not be recognizable. \n\nHonestly I'm rather suspicious and now I want to see a link to this menu. I've been eating sushi for literally decades, both the Americanized stuff coast to coast and also in Japan. If there's a menu, one expects customers to be able to have choices.", "What about ramen, or pork dumplings, because I've never seen a sushi restaurant menu that didn't have both of those.
