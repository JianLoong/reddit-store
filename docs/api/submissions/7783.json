Not being there is her being excluded, which at this point sounds like her best option. \n\nHer perspective is way off. She is young so I do believe she deserves grace and compassion while navigating this undeniably toxic behavior. She is acting as if it's her world and everyone, including the boyfriend (the REASON for the celebratory meal), is just living in it.

Is this the first time she's displayed this kind of behavior? \n\nNTA for anything you said to your daughter. Everything you said to her was reasonable and logical. The reason there is an issue is because your daughter is not thinking reasonably or logically. Also, treating your son's boyfriend to a meal to celebrate him is so nice of you to offer.

I've never been to a sushi restaurant that didn't have a) several fish-free sushi options (cucumber, sweet potato, chicken, beef, etc., etc.) *in addition* to b) an extensive cooked food menu (soup, noodles, salad, teriyaki, tempura, etc., etc.)", "Some sushi restaurants have a kitchen menu and a sushi bar menu.", "Yeah, seaweed salad is usually just seasoned seaweed. It\u2019d be like ordering a spinach side for dinner.", "Yes. And OP could always call and ask what options they have because they may have a couple of options off menu. But even if the only food was rice, she should eat rice with soy sauce and she can stop and get fast food on the at home"]}
