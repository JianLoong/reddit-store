He doesn\u2019t send money, or comes to visit, even though he doesn\u2019t legally have to, he has no parental rights, he still should check up on his daughter.

You have heard his girlfriend say that Maya isn't \"real family\" so of course you wouldn't want that type of energy at her own birthday party", "NTA at all. Your brother is a deadbeat and has chosen to be out of his daughter\u2019s life for years while breeding multiple kids with someone else. You don\u2019t owe him or his new family jack shit.", "NTA. Brother's partner made it clear where his eldest child stands in the family hierarchy - nowhere. Since he has no/little contact with her, has no parental rights, and doesn't contribute in any way to her upbringing, have you thought about petitioning for adoption?", "NTA - this dead beat can beat it. The fact that you\u2019re sole guardian to his kid with zero help financially or otherwise speaks volumes about both of you. You took the high road by inviting him at all and he made it about himself and his \u201creal family\u201d. Tell your mom if she wants an opinion she can start caring and paying for your niece.", "NTA.  You are now the legal guardian for your niece, and you have every right to not invite a person that\u2019s been keeping your nieces father away from her.  Maybe he can have a say in who should be invited to his daughters party when he stops being a deadbeat and be a better father", "NTA.\n\nChildren are their own people and we should check in with them to see how they feel.\n\nI agree with you that he has taken a backseat to being a parent to his daughter and even lost his parental rights and now his new wife is like we don't want your kids.\n\nThat is just disgusting to me.  Children are innocent.\n\nYou cannot force people to love.\n\nThe party should have been about him and his daughter, not him and his daughter and all of his kids.\n\nHe downplays her entire experience and says to me, I won't love you unless...\n\nHe asked, you said no, you do not have to explain yourself.\n\nMy daughter's stepdad is her Dad in her eyes for a reason.\n\nDead beat Dads are deadbeat Dads.", "NTA - Give that poor kid all the love you can, because her father clearly doesn't give a damn. He probably only came because it would be \"fun\" for \"his real family.\"", "NTA.  If this guy had wanted parental rights over his child, he should have claimed them when he was supposed to.  How does he expect any rights when he's not even paying a dime in child support?", "NTA\nYou are a good stand in mamma to your niece. Keep putting her first and it will all be worth it in the end. Sorry things are hard with her dad, your brother. It was kind of you to invite him, sorry he didn't appreciate that.", "NTA. I'd want to keep that woman away from my kid too.", "NTA\n\nTell him to suck a fat one.  \n\nChildren are not accessories to be worn sometimes and put away at other times.  If he wants to be a part of her life, tell him to start sending financial support and scheduling purposeful activities and 1-1 time (supervised).\n\nGuess what - he wont.  You know why?  Because she's not a priority in his life.  F-him.  F-him right in the face.", "NTA, this is your daughters decision and that\u2019s that! If she wants them in her life at some point she can make that choice. Glad you stood up for her.", ">I also got text from my mother saying how wrong it was.\n\nHas she been raising your brother's kid for the past three years because your brother didn't feel like it? No? Guess who raised your brother like that. NTA.", "INFO: what relationship dynamic does Maya have with her bio dad/your brother? Like does she call him \u201cdaddy\u201d? What about with his wife and their children (her half siblings)?", "NTA the child will know who was there for her, and who wasn't. You brother is just upset he's a failure.", "Honestly I don't know why you get called auntie. Your that babies mom. If he wanted to be a parent he should have been, then he could invite whoever he wants to her party. Nta", "NTA\n\n> he has no parental rights\n\n>that he could bring his girlfriend to his daughters party.\n\nShe's not his daughter. He has no parental rights, and that includes the right to decide who is invited to her party.\n\nMeanwhile this:\n\n>My brother then told maya \u201caunties sending daddy away\u201d \n\nIs someone deliberately causing emotional harm to your child.\n\nWhether you call her \"daughter\" or \"niece\", she's yours, and it's your job to protect her. I'd suggest removing the abusive parent from her life entirely. If not, this is only going to get more confusing and painful for her.", "You are protecting that child, keep doing it. NTA", "NTA\n\nFirstly, trying showing up to a party when you have been specifically asked not to is just rude\n\nSecondly, if gf thinks Maya isnt \"real family\" then she shouldn't be involved with her.", "NTA. You keep that gf away. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to say something awful to Maya when no one is looking.", "NTA.  The gf has already stated your niece is not 'real family'. So why would they want to attend a party they weren't invited to for non-family member.", "ESH - your brother is a deadbeat, and she's probably better off without him.\n\nI'm putting this partly on you though because you're encouraging her bio-dad to be part of her life even though he has no rights.  This seems like it would be confusing for the child. I mean, you said you have custody, so you're essentially her parent.  Have you adopted her?  It just seems to me that encouraging him to interact with her is opening the door for uncertainty and questions in her mind about who people are, the roles they play in her life, and whether or not she's wanted.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother is a deadbeat loser.  You\u2019re great aunt and parent to Maya.  She\u2019s lucky to have you.", "NTA, and don't you fall for his selfish attempt to guilt-trip you by proxy. He knew they weren't invited, he chose do bring them and then make a scene and then he chose to leave. He is chosing them over Maya on a daily basis and now he chose them over her bday also. You seem to be doing right by your niece and I hope you and your family don't have to deal with this bs for long.", "NTA. It's fine to want to keep someone who has treated a child negatively from that child's birthday party. If the dad wanted his daughter to know his new family, he could make the effort to make plans for them to be together at some other time. It seems like he's more concerned about himself and his girlfriend being disrespected than what is best for his daughter.", "INFO: Did you ask Maya what she wanted? I understand and agree with your feelings but it is her birthday party and her father whom she does call daddy. Did she express any opinion on who she wanted at her party or did you unilaterally make that decision for her?", "I would remind him how many times in the past 4 years he has visited her or sent money for her care. $0", "NTA. They did not want to be there for Maya's birthday. It was a big party and they wanted to have a lot of fun for free. Maya had nothing to do with it. It would have been obvious to her if they stayed, and would have cast a cloud over the whole day.", "NTA, bet they just wanted free cake and food for their other kids and possibly throw a fit and demand her presents too.", "My sentiments exactly, NTA - OP has had full custody of the child for three years and has had no expectations from the brother. For him to be redic dramatic at a 6-yr-olds birthday day is obnoxious.", "OP\u2019s a better person than me as I wouldn\u2019t have invited him to begin with.", "I\u2019m in the process of it.

This is the first time this year in 2023 he\u2019s even seen her. He lives 20 minutes away. His girlfriend I\u2019m not sure how they interact but his gf is very against maya being part of the family", "I see where you\u2019re coming from, but I think with really young children it\u2019s important to remember that we can pretty much tell them to call us whatever. She might simply call him daddy because he refers to himself as such or because that\u2019s how other people refer to him to her \u201chave you seen your daddy recently?\u201d It might be less about the relationship and more about the expectation that she call him that. \n\nWhen I met my bio dad I called him by his first name for a while, because that\u2019s what I was comfortable with. Then my cousin yelled at me one day that I was hurting his feelings by not calling him dad, so I switched because that\u2019s what I thought was expected of me - not because that\u2019s how I viewed our relationship", "Good to know!

Thanks.", "Yeah definitely NTA especially since the effort isn\u2019t exerted from him to see her and make sure that she is felt loved and welcome in his home. I\u2019d also consider getting Maya to a therapist if you haven\u2019t already to support her with this whole dynamic."]}
