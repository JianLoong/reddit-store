I told him and confirmed whether he'd made a purchase yet or not which he hadn't. \n\nI was set on having a gold ring with sapphire and diamonds, inspired by the Zora Sapphire from the Zelda franchise but not exactly like it. I found several rings I loved on Etsy that were easily affordable (half a month of his salary tops) and I saved all of them in my favorites and left tab open on my phone. \n\nHe and I have access to each other's phones and I told him that the tab was there for him to look at. I also showed the rings to our close friend so she could help him. \nHe later showed me pictures of rings he found online that were replicas of the Zora Sapphire with silver bands. I was honest and told him I didn't like them and that I hated the silver and how silver looks with gold and with sapphire, and I reiterated what I liked in a ring.\n\nFour months later he botched a proposal (wrapped the ring in plastic wrap and put it in one of those plastic capsules that come in a Kinder Surprise egg and had it floating in a half full bath while I was naked, vulnerable, and visibly tired and irritable after working a 13.5 hour day. He was fully dressed. The day before we were supposed to go on a beautiful date.)\n\nThe ring was the Zora Sapphire with the silver band that he knew I didn't like.

Lots of people are gonna come on and say you shouldn\u2019t need a big proposal or a specific ring to want to marry someone. But truthfully, the way they propose and the ring they get you are signalers of how the other person views and values you.

Now it's just a whole load of meh.", "NTA. He asked for your input and then ignored it. And half-assed the proposal. He showed you the amount of effort you are worth and I would be re-thinking the whole relationships", "NTA.\n\nYour engagement and wedding rings are the only two pieces of jewelry that you will be wearing every day, presumably for the rest of your life. There is absolutely no excuse for him to go out and buy a ring without first checking to make sure the style would be something you liked. None. Zero. Zilch. \n\nAnd proposing by putting the ring in a cheapo plastic bag while you're destressing in the bathtub?! Ugh.\n\nYou were right to reject that whole thing.", "NTA - He should have made the effort to get what you liked.", "NTA. He ignored you and then did a weird proposal.", "NTA waiting is wise. He didn't listen to you about something big, something that you made very clear was important to you. Doesn't matter if it was a ring or a car or a puppy. He didn't listen. Maybe he will figure it out & things will work out. Maybe you will realize that he doesn't listen about other things and it's a deal breaker. Time will tell.", "NTA\n\nI think you behaved very reasonably throughout.", "NTA\n\nThis is obviously something important to you, and he couldn't or wouldn't see it. The man was given all the info he needed. He got visuals, he got conversations. He made a mistake, found out early that he messed up, and then chose not to correct it when he had the opportunity. Then the proposal was poorly done as well. He's the AH here for not listening to his partner, not considering her needs/wants, and deliberately choosing something he knew you wouldn't like.\n\nI won't presume to know enough about your relationship to jump on the \"Dump him!\" bandwagon, but I do think it was smart to say no. Y'all should probably look into why he didn't listen and figure out whether this was a one off or is a more serious issue in your relationship.  Hopefully this was a just a bit of bad judgement on his part and you can move on. Good luck!", "NTA \n\nWe picked out our rings together. I got exactly what I wanted, and so did he. Maybe that's not romantic but it works better that way for some people! And the way he proposed? Icky. \n\nI know a lot of people say they'd be happy with a ring-pop and I do \"get\" that, but realistically this is one of the few pieces of jewelry you'll be wearing daily for years, and it should be something you want on your finger.

You clearly communicated with him what you wanted and he did not listen. This is one of the biggest events of your lives- he should care about what you want.

Not a good sign as a whole.", "NTA\n\nHe ignored you and then got mad at you because he messed up big time. Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA take the loss, if you keep the ring it will be a constant reminder of how he doesn\u2019t listen to you and doesn\u2019t really care about what you want. He also upon finding out he was wrong made no plans to correct or fix the mistake when he could have. He gave you something you didn\u2019t want and hoped you would feel obligated to accept because he put in minimal effort. Think about your figure and if you still want to marry him make him get the correct ring and re propose. Tell him to post the other one himself and re sell it. He should be doing it\u2019s", "NTA, it's not about the ring. And I see there are people complaining about your wording of botched proposal. I agree with you, it was. Naked in a bath and exhausted after a long day at work while he is fully dressed is, pardon me, fucking weird. My husband and I knew that we were going to get married when we moved in together, *then just kind of agreed that the time had passed and due to circumstances had a cute little elopement. I don't regret the elopement but something about well thought out, sincere proposals trigger an emotional response in me. I would have wanted a romantic moment with my husband saying sweet things to hold onto during the harder times.", "definitely NTA.  he fully knew you didn't like it and made no effort to cancel it.   you have to live with this thing forever, i think you should like it.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I'm laughing at the botched proposal, I'm just imagining exactly how it went down!\n\nRings can seriously mean things to other people, if someone is particular, the other half best pay attention!\n\nThe colour of the bloody metal is a pretty obvious thing to pay attention to.", "NTA. The ring matters! Getting something you specifically said you don't like is pretty disrespectful.", "NTA \n\nLol. Oh dear.\n\nEngagement rings are so important that you should never take any chances. When I got engaged, my wife found a picture of what she wanted and I got a ring made. OK, not always an option but he could have got advice from a jeweller. They can match ring designs and get something close.", "ESH..\n\nYou laid it out clearly.

At the end of the day you\u2019re the one wearing it. \n\nYou obviously can\u2019t expect him to get the exact ring you want but he couldn\u2019t even get you the colour you wanted. \n\nDoes he often ignore your preferences? I feel like, given that you gave him a very simple request multiple times and he still didn\u2019t even get the right colour, it could be a sign that he\u2019s always gonna ignore you like that.", "NTA. I agree he's not ready if he totally ignored your preference (opinion) after you served it to him on silver platter repeatedly and didn't bother to anything about it when he knew he choose wrong. And I feel you regarding proposal. Mine was quite bad too, it sucks even more because I had to wait years for it. Ring also had one of features that was on \"no list\" and wrong size. Luckily my husband has \"we can return it if you don't like it\" gifts policy. So we used the stones in completely different setting. Wedding was awesome thought.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI said yes to a lazy proposal delivered at a stressful moment for all the wrong reasons (to make someone else happy), and I have regretted it ever since.\n\nI don't regret choosing my husband, but I regret saying yes in a moment that didn't make me feel special in any way.\n\nI wish I had been more like you.", "NTA. You spoon-fed him the information and he still fucked it up.", "YTA. You may have been set on that ring, maybe he was set on having a partner who's not so superficial. Anyone who calls a proposal \"botched\" just because it wasn't how they pictured and not because someone got injured or the ring was lost is not ready to be engaged anyway.", "ESH. Him for not listening and you for the \u2018botched proposal\u2019.", "YTA. You apparently are quite specific about what you want in both a ring and a proposal. At your age, living together already, having discussed the ring and all---is it really necessary to have some perfect surprise romance-movie proposal?  I'm surprised this guy is willing to move past what's happened here.", "ESH - he should have done it better, but that doesn't mean you don't get engaged. You can always exchange the ring.

If the ring is more important than the man who proposed, you shouldn\u2019t get married at all.  My husband proposed impromptu in his boxers.   I didn\u2019t care about the ring at all.

You should like it.", "NTA - You made it really easy for him to know what to get you and he decided to ignore all of it and then half-ass the rest of it.

It's only a ring. If you wanted that specific ring, thrn go buy it yourself", "YTA and sound entitled at the least. You should feel so special that he even got you a nice ring at all.

He asked your ring size not what ring you wanted, he got the cut and gem you wanted he got the cheaper base material.

You were coordinating on the proposal. You were to be involved in the decision process and you were clear about what you wanted and he got something else before he bounced his ideas off of you.

I think you did the right thing to say no. And his reaction is very telling too.

The fact that she said she did not like the silver ones and he still did not say anything is wrong.", "His proposal was leaving it in plastic wrap and a plastic wrap in a bath. Right before a date where he could have proposed. The ring is not the only problem.", "I agree wholeheartedly with the proposal view. I think both parties should\u2019ve been involved. Obviously OP was disappointed on how they were proposed to and I think that could\u2019ve been solved with a conversation on if they wanted it to be intimate vs public and general expectations. But the ring? Traditionally the woman gets handed an engagement ring and ultimately has to wear it. Had she shown disinterest or been evasive about what she wanted, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s be an issue. But she gave him links to specific rings she would\u2019ve been happy with. If I did that and was ignored by my partner, I\u2019d be pretty disappointed as well.", "She was naked in a bath after a long day of work and he was fully dressed. Even if not just about what the woman wants that takes **nothing** into account about what she might have wanted. And the ring absolutely should be what the woman wants within affordable reason as she'll be the one wearing it. I'm a woman, and no I don't think it matters.", "The comment you\u2019re replying to makes no reference to gender whatsoever. Just that the person proposing should consider what the person they\u2019re proposing to would want, which is a pretty good indicator of how they value you.", "They CAN be tiny things, if you do not have preferences. If you do, though, and you communicate those preferences, but your partner blatantly ignores them? No, they are not tiny things, because they are symbolic of a much larger problem. I told my husband that I wanted a quiet, private proposal. If he had proposed to me at a baseball game, with a camera on us for the jumbotron, I would have been horrified. Maybe you didn't care how your proposal went or how your ring looked. Some people do *and they're entitled to*. FOH with this idea that OP is immature because she communicated her preferences to her partner and was ignored.", "But as a married woman as well they are indicators of how the man is. My husband botched my proposal and it wasn\u2019t just the proposal and ring, he botched everything. He wasn\u2019t a considerate partner. However, we went to therapy and grew up (got married really young) and now stuff like this doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nSo, yes while proposals and rings are a tiny, tony thing in the grand scheme of marriage, it is a big indicator of stuff. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m confused as to why you needed to mention you\u2019ve never seen a diamond smaller than yours except for one other one\u2026 I thought you said rings don\u2019t matter\u2026", "It\u2019s not about the ring, it\u2019s about the thought out into it. OP\u2019s preferences, that were clearly vocalized, we\u2019re ignored.", "That\u2019s fine. People can have different wants and needs from a relationship than OP. To them, they had a ring in mind that they have to wear for the rest of their lives. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ridiculous to want one that she likes, and went as far as to offer options within budget that she really liked. The \u201cbecause you want a ring you don\u2019t love him enough\u201d is ridiculous to me. Rings and proposals are meant to be a display of love to the other person. You may think it\u2019s childish, but it\u2019s a personal belief to want to value. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found happiness without wanting anything material, but that\u2019s not the case for everyone. And it\u2019s obviously important to OP.", "So in other words, you married someone who shared your values and ideals. \n\nProposals and rings *are* tiny things, but they can be symbolic of bigger issues. The problem here isn't the size of the ring, it's that she expressed what she wanted, and he didn't care enough to get it right or fix it once he'd gotten it wrong. She wants someone who's going to listen to her and care about her feelings, and if he can't get it right with the ring, chances are good he's not going to work as hard on the rest.\n\nIf it matters, I've never had an engagement ring; my husband proposed with his own Star of David. I wouldn't have expected or asked for that, but because we were both broke as rocks and he knew I'd be mad if he blew money on a ring, he went for the most personal and meaningful piece of jewelry he already owned. We've been together 20 years and still happy as clams. OP isn't wrong for wanting someone who cares about what she wants.", "NTA, I've been married 20, never wanted marriage and kids yet I did because the woman I loved wanted them and the thought of not having her in my life was unbearable. Even not wanting those things I still made a huge effort knowing what kind of ring she wanted and made a huge effort with the proposal. I made my own Christmas advent calendar which had a reason why I loved her in it each day with a gift of something she'd love every day with the ring in the final day. She loved it so much we had the love notes from each day made into a collage and framed. It's a statement of intent if you show some half assed I'll propose while she's in the bath after a 13 hour day with a ring I know she doesn't like it sets red flags going. Not everyone is the same but doing things so half assed isn't the best way to ask someone to spend the rest of your life together.", "I think more of the issue here is lack of communication. OP basically handed her bf all her requirements on a silver platter, and he refused to acknowledge them. Ring she didn't want? Give it to her anyway. She's in a vulnerable state in the bathroom? Sure why not. Why did he not consider any of her requests? To make a point? That's not how relationships grow.", "My ring is small, and that's great, because that is what I wanted. My main stone isn't even real diamond, which is great, because my partner knows I'm not a diamond person, and the only reason the stone is a \"diamond\" is because it's our daughter's birthstone, and our birthstones are the accent stones. You know what the most important part about the physical aspect of my ring is? It is incredibly me. It's a ring I will happily wear the rest of my life, because it fits my style and personality, and I love it. Now, unlike OP, I hate yellow gold. Would I have been upset if my ring had been yellow gold? Yes, because I wouldn't want to wear it. My partner knows that about me, and bought me a ring that showed he knew me. It's not about the price or the size. It's about the intimacy of knowing someone well enough that you pay attention to their jewelry preferences when buying them a lifelong ring.\n\nOP, NTA. You seem mostly upset about the fact that your partner didn't put in the thought, care, and time that a partner should before something big like an engagement.", "Just because you feel this way does not mean that everyone else has to share YOUR feelings. They may be tiny things to you and your relationship might have been fundamentally different then yours but that doesn't mean they aren't mature enough. Everyone is different you can't view everything from the same lense.", "I'm happy too, except that my wife has rather expensive taste.......", "What effort did *she* make?", "I don\u2019t understand the emphasis on clothing.  What is the significance of that?", "There is no engagement. OP said no.", "There\u2019s no engagement to break off because bro doesn\u2019t know how to listen :) when someone shows that they didn\u2019t take your input into consideration when buying something you\u2019ll wear everyday, it kinda turns you off the idea", "Seriously, what is the significance of her being naked and boyfriend being clothed?", "I do know mine was less than average because I went with a gold band with an emerald instead of a diamond, but that\u2019s also what I wanted. It\u2019s moreso about listening to what your partner wants than the cost, as long as the cost is within reason for a budget. And everyone\u2019s budget is different.", "She researched to help make it easier for him. I'm sure if he wanted a ring or her to propose, she would've taken into account what he wanted. It's unfair to put it back on her considering the two seemed to have an agreement that he'd be the one to propose. She did what she could to make it easier for him instead of a guessing game.", "I think it's linked to the REASON she's naked, like if he had ran her a bath after/ before a cute date for example and was actively sitting next to her talking and washing her hair or something where her being undressed was a romantic/sexy thing there wouldn't be an issue. What he did sounds more akin to if my husband came back in after a fucker of a day working on the railway, stripped to wash all the dirt off himself and calm down and i just walked in and proposed with no prior context to make it a nice moment. Just kinda...weird? Not malicious or anything, just weird choice of timing. There are times where proposing to a naked person would be perfectly ok, that isn't one imo", "It\u2019s a weird and awkward imbalance. Like she\u2019s naked, wet, stressed out. Trying to bath herself and he comes in the bathroom to propose, fully dressed. \n\nIf they were \u201ctaking a romantic bath together\u201d and he was in the bath with her, some wine - then the proposal. That Makes sense! \n\nBut from the sound of it, it was an awkward situation, not at all romantic or thoughtful", "It says that he popped the question when *he* wanted to do it, with no consideration for her feelings. After a 13-hour day, she was tired and cranky and wanted to take a bath without some plastic shit floating in it. She couldn't even take pictures because of the setting and her state, and hugging a clothed person when you're naked doesn't always feel great. If he'd also been nude (bathing with her, for example) then at least they'd have been on semi-equal comfort footing and he could be given the benefit of the doubt for trying to be romantic or something. This just sounds like he was impatient to get the rush of her acceptance, and forgot to think about her in the process.", "i mean, if i were in that position i would be feeling taken aback, surprised, and a little cornered on top of being *really* pissed off that my relaxation time unwinding and recharging from a long, hard day at work got shoved sideways into Memory Making Time.", "She was in an intimate setting, he was not. When she tells the story to people, they will picture her naked. She was taking a bath to unwind from stress (a solo activity) and he barged in (even if he did it gently) and put a ring in the bath with her. He didn't draw her the bath, she made the bath. She had just worked 13+ hours and didn't feel beautiful (which is something women like to feel while being proposed to).  \n\nUsually, there are a few small checks to do before proposing to your girlfriend: are her nails done or clean, if she prefers wearing makeup in pictures is she currently wearing makeup? Is she wearing a cute outfit? Ex. If yall hike cause that's your thing, is she wearing a too big shirt, or a matching work out set? She should probably wear a set if that's what she likes and your proposing to her. Or add a fanny pack to the too big shirt so she has a waist in pictures. And you can easily trick her into this by saying something like \"where we are going is super pretty and I know you want some pictures for: the wall, Instagram, your mom etc. Let's wear cuter outfits for when we get to the top!\" \n\nIf you are proposing to someone, you should know them enough to know what they want to look like when they are proposed to. Naked, wet and sad is on that list for very few people.", "Pretty hard to throw your arms around someone when one is naked and immersed in water and the other is dressed in dry clothes. \n\nPlus idk about everyone but if I'm in the bath trying to relax after a hard day it's kind of rude to not wait until I'm done and dressed again before throwing something at me that I will need to emotionally respond to (because saying, \"hey, sure I'll marry you,\" with an exhausted tone is going to cause hurt feelings, but I can't always muster up the enthusiasm an event would require when I'm wiped out, you know?)\n\nLike, let the woman finish her bath first for Pete's sake", "Dominance is the issue, she is naked, vulnerable tired and prone, he is standing leaning over her fully clothed. It can be seen as a powerplay and a very unequal scene, at a time when he is supposedly proposing a partnership, not 'lording it over her.' Like a master offering up a manacle to a slave.", "Having something you like is the most important part. It symbolises your relationship and your intent to marry, afterall.", "Not making him read her mind is the bare minimum. Its not unfair. Whats unfair is that the onesidedness about proposing is still a thing and this pressure put on men to conform to their SOs dream-whatever event is pretty heavy but extremely normalised to the point of any complaint about it being met with ridicule. This sub will demonize a man for wanting his SO to take his surname but traditions favouring the bride are completely a-okay", "Exactly.", "But could you see from the other side, \u201cmaybe this will make my gf happy after a long day?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with the thought process but instead of jumping to assume the bf was thoughtless it\u2019s entirely possible he just misjudged the situation.", "That\u2019s such a weird reading of the situation", "Blimey! That's quite an extrapolation there.", "If she had decided to plan out the proposal and propose to him instead, he'd have been pissed at her for taking over what he wanted to do. I agree that who proposes shouldn't be gendered at all. Whoever does the proposing, however, should take into account what their partner likes. For example, I'm an introvert, so if I was to be proposed to, I'd want it to be in private; however, if I was doing the proposing and the person I loved wanted something public, I'd try to plan a way for that to work within my comfort zone. It's definitely about compromise and working together.", "Lol but the answer to that would generally be no tho. She is in the bath to relax and have some alone time after a 14 hr day, so let her relax.", "This is the wrong take, who wants to experience a super memorable moment in their life naked and soaking wet? \n\nThere wasn't even an ounce of effort in his proposal.", "not particularly, because after three and a half years of living with someone? that someone ought to know where i want/need to be after a day like that.\n\nmy roommate, for instance\u2014 always wanted to see me after i got home from work and make small talk and hang together soon as i got in the door. it took a couple times telling them politely before i had to be blunt in explaining: that i am Peopled Out when i get home. i need 30 minutes to an hour to decompress and relax by myself before i can interact with anyone else otherwise i will be irritable and snap at them because i'm at the end of my rope. guess what that roommate does now? *leaves me be when i get home unless i initiate the interaction*. they respect my space and my recharge process.\n\nand that's a *roommate*. you would think a wannabe fiance would be at least as intuitive and considerate as a platonic roommate.", "Yea, that is an odd read of it. But there is still a power dynamic if you\u2019re naked and your partner is fully clothed.", "This is nothing less you should expect from redditors.\n\nRedditors are absurdly wild in AITA with their assumptions And reading between The lines", "Thats pure conjencture and assumption but sure, you want to believe that so do."]}
