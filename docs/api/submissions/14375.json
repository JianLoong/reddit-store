I found several rings I loved on Etsy that were easily affordable (half a month of his salary tops) and I saved all of them in my favorites and left tab open on my phone. \n\nHe and I have access to each other's phones and I told him that the tab was there for him to look at. I also showed the rings to our close friend so she could help him. \nHe later showed me pictures of rings he found online that were replicas of the Zora Sapphire with silver bands. I was honest and told him I didn't like them and that I hated the silver and how silver looks with gold and with sapphire, and I reiterated what I liked in a ring.\n\nFour months later he botched a proposal (wrapped the ring in plastic wrap and put it in one of those plastic capsules that come in a Kinder Surprise egg and had it floating in a half full bath while I was naked, vulnerable, and visibly tired and irritable after working a 13.5 hour day. He was fully dressed. The day before we were supposed to go on a beautiful date.)\n\nThe ring was the Zora Sapphire with the silver band that he knew I didn't like.

Lots of people are gonna come on and say you shouldn\u2019t need a big proposal or a specific ring to want to marry someone.

Zilch. \n\nAnd proposing by putting the ring in a cheapo plastic bag while you're destressing in the bathtub?! Ugh.\n\nYou were right to reject that whole thing.", "NTA - He should have made the effort to get what you liked.", "NTA. He ignored you and then did a weird proposal.", "NTA waiting is wise. He didn't listen to you about something big, something that you made very clear was important to you. Doesn't matter if it was a ring or a car or a puppy. He didn't listen.

The man was given all the info he needed. He got visuals, he got conversations. He made a mistake, found out early that he messed up, and then chose not to correct it when he had the opportunity. Then the proposal was poorly done as well. He's the AH here for not listening to his partner, not considering her needs/wants, and deliberately choosing something he knew you wouldn't like.\n\nI won't presume to know enough about your relationship to jump on the \"Dump him!\" bandwagon, but I do think it was smart to say no. Y'all should probably look into why he didn't listen and figure out whether this was a one off or is a more serious issue in your relationship.  Hopefully this was a just a bit of bad judgement on his part and you can move on. Good luck!", "NTA \n\nWe picked out our rings together. I got exactly what I wanted, and so did he. Maybe that's not romantic but it works better that way for some people! And the way he proposed? Icky. \n\nI know a lot of people say they'd be happy with a ring-pop and I do \"get\" that, but realistically this is one of the few pieces of jewelry you'll be wearing daily for years, and it should be something you want on your finger.

He also upon finding out he was wrong made no plans to correct or fix the mistake when he could have. He gave you something you didn\u2019t want and hoped you would feel obligated to accept because he put in minimal effort.

Naked in a bath and exhausted after a long day at work while he is fully dressed is, pardon me, fucking weird. My husband and I knew that we were going to get married when we moved in together, *then just kind of agreed that the time had passed and due to circumstances had a cute little elopement. I don't regret the elopement but something about well thought out, sincere proposals trigger an emotional response in me. I would have wanted a romantic moment with my husband saying sweet things to hold onto during the harder times.", "definitely NTA.  he fully knew you didn't like it and made no effort to cancel it.   you have to live with this thing forever, i think you should like it.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I'm laughing at the botched proposal, I'm just imagining exactly how it went down!\n\nRings can seriously mean things to other people, if someone is particular, the other half best pay attention!\n\nThe colour of the bloody metal is a pretty obvious thing to pay attention to.", "NTA. The ring matters! Getting something you specifically said you don't like is pretty disrespectful.", "NTA \n\nLol. Oh dear.\n\nEngagement rings are so important that you should never take any chances. When I got engaged, my wife found a picture of what she wanted and I got a ring made. OK, not always an option but he could have got advice from a jeweller.

At the end of the day you\u2019re the one wearing it. \n\nYou obviously can\u2019t expect him to get the exact ring you want but he couldn\u2019t even get you the colour you wanted. \n\nDoes he often ignore your preferences?

I agree he's not ready if he totally ignored your preference (opinion) after you served it to him on silver platter repeatedly and didn't bother to anything about it when he knew he choose wrong. And I feel you regarding proposal. Mine was quite bad too, it sucks even more because I had to wait years for it. Ring also had one of features that was on \"no list\" and wrong size. Luckily my husband has \"we can return it if you don't like it\" gifts policy. So we used the stones in completely different setting.

You spoon-fed him the information and he still fucked it up.", "YTA. You may have been set on that ring, maybe he was set on having a partner who's not so superficial.

But the ring? Traditionally the woman gets handed an engagement ring and ultimately has to wear it. Had she shown disinterest or been evasive about what she wanted, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s be an issue. But she gave him links to specific rings she would\u2019ve been happy with. If I did that and was ignored by my partner, I\u2019d be pretty disappointed as well.", "She was naked in a bath after a long day of work and he was fully dressed. Even if not just about what the woman wants that takes **nothing** into account about what she might have wanted. And the ring absolutely should be what the woman wants within affordable reason as she'll be the one wearing it. I'm a woman, and no I don't think it matters.", "The comment you\u2019re replying to makes no reference to gender whatsoever. Just that the person proposing should consider what the person they\u2019re proposing to would want, which is a pretty good indicator of how they value you.", "They CAN be tiny things, if you do not have preferences. If you do, though, and you communicate those preferences, but your partner blatantly ignores them? No, they are not tiny things, because they are symbolic of a much larger problem. I told my husband that I wanted a quiet, private proposal. If he had proposed to me at a baseball game, with a camera on us for the jumbotron, I would have been horrified. Maybe you didn't care how your proposal went or how your ring looked. Some people do *and they're entitled to*. FOH with this idea that OP is immature because she communicated her preferences to her partner and was ignored.", "But as a married woman as well they are indicators of how the man is. My husband botched my proposal and it wasn\u2019t just the proposal and ring, he botched everything. He wasn\u2019t a considerate partner. However, we went to therapy and grew up (got married really young) and now stuff like this doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nSo, yes while proposals and rings are a tiny, tiny thing in the grand scheme of marriage, it is a big indicator of stuff. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m confused as to why you needed to mention you\u2019ve never seen a diamond smaller than yours except for one other one\u2026 I thought you said rings don\u2019t matter\u2026", "It\u2019s not about the ring, it\u2019s about the thought put into it. OP\u2019s preferences, that were clearly vocalized, we\u2019re ignored.", "That\u2019s fine. People can have different wants and needs from a relationship than OP. To them, they had a ring in mind that they have to wear for the rest of their lives. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ridiculous to want one that she likes, and went as far as to offer options within budget that she really liked. The \u201cbecause you want a ring you don\u2019t love him enough\u201d is ridiculous to me. Rings and proposals are meant to be a display of love to the other person. You may think it\u2019s childish, but it\u2019s a personal belief to want to value. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found happiness without wanting anything material, but that\u2019s not the case for everyone. And it\u2019s obviously important to OP.", "So in other words, you married someone who shared your values and ideals. \n\nProposals and rings *are* tiny things, but they can be symbolic of bigger issues. The problem here isn't the size of the ring, it's that she expressed what she wanted, and he didn't care enough to get it right or fix it once he'd gotten it wrong. She wants someone who's going to listen to her and care about her feelings, and if he can't get it right with the ring, chances are good he's not going to work as hard on the rest.\n\nIf it matters, I've never had an engagement ring; my husband proposed with his own Star of David. I wouldn't have expected or asked for that, but because we were both broke as rocks and he knew I'd be mad if he blew money on a ring, he went for the most personal and meaningful piece of jewelry he already owned. We've been together 20 years and still happy as clams. OP isn't wrong for wanting someone who cares about what she wants.", "NTA, I've been married 20, never wanted marriage and kids yet I did because the woman I loved wanted them and the thought of not having her in my life was unbearable. Even not wanting those things I still made a huge effort knowing what kind of ring she wanted and made a huge effort with the proposal. I made my own Christmas advent calendar which had a reason why I loved her in it each day with a gift of something she'd love every day with the ring in the final day. She loved it so much we had the love notes from each day made into a collage and framed. It's a statement of intent if you show some half assed I'll propose while she's in the bath after a 13 hour day with a ring I know she doesn't like it sets red flags going. Not everyone is the same but doing things so half assed isn't the best way to ask someone to spend the rest of your life together.", "I think more of the issue here is lack of communication. OP basically handed her bf all her requirements on a silver platter, and he refused to acknowledge them. Ring she didn't want? Give it to her anyway. She's in a vulnerable state in the bathroom? Sure why not. Why did he not consider any of her requests? To make a point? That's not how relationships grow.", "My ring is small, and that's great, because that is what I wanted. My main stone isn't even real diamond, which is great, because my partner knows I'm not a diamond person, and the only reason the stone is a \"diamond\" is because it's our daughter's birthstone, and our birthstones are the accent stones. You know what the most important part about the physical aspect of my ring is? It is incredibly me. It's a ring I will happily wear the rest of my life, because it fits my style and personality, and I love it. Now, unlike OP, I hate yellow gold. Would I have been upset if my ring had been yellow gold? Yes, because I wouldn't want to wear it. My partner knows that about me, and bought me a ring that showed he knew me. It's not about the price or the size. It's about the intimacy of knowing someone well enough that you pay attention to their jewelry preferences when buying them a lifelong ring.\n\nOP, NTA. You seem mostly upset about the fact that your partner didn't put in the thought, care, and time that a partner should before something big like an engagement.", "Just because you feel this way does not mean that everyone else has to share YOUR feelings. They may be tiny things to you and your relationship might have been fundamentally different then yours but that doesn't mean they aren't mature enough. Everyone is different you can't view everything from the same lense.", "I'm happy too, except that my wife has rather expensive taste.......", "What effort did *she* make?", "I don\u2019t understand the emphasis on clothing.  What is the significance of that?", "There is no engagement. OP said no.", "There\u2019s no engagement to break off because bro doesn\u2019t know how to listen :) when someone shows that they didn\u2019t take your input into consideration when buying something you\u2019ll wear everyday, it kinda turns you off the idea", "Seriously, what is the significance of her being naked and boyfriend being clothed?", "I do know mine was less than average because I went with a gold band with an emerald instead of a diamond, but that\u2019s also what I wanted. It\u2019s moreso about listening to what your partner wants than the cost, as long as the cost is within reason for a budget. And everyone\u2019s budget is different.", "She researched to help make it easier for him. I'm sure if he wanted a ring or her to propose, she would've taken into account what he wanted. It's unfair to put it back on her considering the two seemed to have an agreement that he'd be the one to propose. She did what she could to make it easier for him instead of a guessing game.", "I think it's linked to the REASON she's naked, like if he had ran her a bath after/ before a cute date for example and was actively sitting next to her talking and washing her hair or something where her being undressed was a romantic/sexy thing there wouldn't be an issue. What he did sounds more akin to if my husband came back in after a fucker of a day working on the railway, stripped to wash all the dirt off himself and calm down and i just walked in and proposed with no prior context to make it a nice moment. Just kinda...weird? Not malicious or anything, just weird choice of timing. There are times where proposing to a naked person would be perfectly ok, that isn't one imo", "It\u2019s a weird and awkward imbalance. Like she\u2019s naked, wet, stressed out. Trying to bath herself and he comes in the bathroom to propose, fully dressed. \n\nIf they were \u201ctaking a romantic bath together\u201d and he was in the bath with her, some wine - then the proposal. That Makes sense! \n\nBut from the sound of it, it was an awkward situation, not at all romantic or thoughtful", "It says that he popped the question when *he* wanted to do it, with no consideration for her feelings. After a 13-hour day, she was tired and cranky and wanted to take a bath without some plastic shit floating in it. She couldn't even take pictures because of the setting and her state, and hugging a clothed person when you're naked doesn't always feel great. If he'd also been nude (bathing with her, for example) then at least they'd have been on semi-equal comfort footing and he could be given the benefit of the doubt for trying to be romantic or something. This just sounds like he was impatient to get the rush of her acceptance, and forgot to think about her in the process.", "i mean, if i were in that position i would be feeling taken aback, surprised, and a little cornered on top of being *really* pissed off that my relaxation time unwinding and recharging from a long, hard day at work got shoved sideways into Memory Making Time.", "She was in an intimate setting, he was not. When she tells the story to people, they will picture her naked. She was taking a bath to unwind from stress (a solo activity) and he barged in (even if he did it gently) and put a ring in the bath with her. He didn't draw her the bath, she made the bath. She had just worked 13+ hours and didn't feel beautiful (which is something women like to feel while being proposed to).  \n\nUsually, there are a few small checks to do before proposing to your girlfriend: are her nails done or clean, if she prefers wearing makeup in pictures is she currently wearing makeup? Is she wearing a cute outfit? Ex. If yall hike cause that's your thing, is she wearing a too big shirt, or a matching work out set? She should probably wear a set if that's what she likes and your proposing to her. Or add a fanny pack to the too big shirt so she has a waist in pictures. And you can easily trick her into this by saying something like \"where we are going is super pretty and I know you want some pictures for: the wall, Instagram, your mom etc. Let's wear cuter outfits for when we get to the top!\" \n\nIf you are proposing to someone, you should know them enough to know what they want to look like when they are proposed to. Naked, wet and sad is on that list for very few people.", "Pretty hard to throw your arms around someone when one is naked and immersed in water and the other is dressed in dry clothes. \n\nPlus idk about everyone but if I'm in the bath trying to relax after a hard day it's kind of rude to not wait until I'm done and dressed again before throwing something at me that I will need to emotionally respond to (because saying, \"hey, sure I'll marry you,\" with an exhausted tone is going to cause hurt feelings, but I can't always muster up the enthusiasm an event would require when I'm wiped out, you know?)\n\nLike, let the woman finish her bath first for Pete's sake", "Dominance is the issue, she is naked, vulnerable tired and prone, he is standing leaning over her fully clothed. It can be seen as a powerplay and a very unequal scene, at a time when he is supposedly proposing a partnership, not 'lording it over her.' Like a master offering up a manacle to a slave.", "Having something you like is the most important part. It symbolises your relationship and your intent to marry, afterall.", "Not making him read her mind is the bare minimum. Its not unfair. Whats unfair is that the onesidedness about proposing is still a thing and this pressure put on men to conform to their SOs dream-whatever event is pretty heavy but extremely normalised to the point of any complaint about it being met with ridicule. This sub will demonize a man for wanting his SO to take his surname but traditions favouring the bride are completely a-okay", "Exactly.", "But could you see from the other side, \u201cmaybe this will make my gf happy after a long day?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with the thought process but instead of jumping to assume the bf was thoughtless it\u2019s entirely possible he just misjudged the situation.", "That\u2019s such a weird reading of the situation", "Blimey! That's quite an extrapolation there.", "If she had decided to plan out the proposal and propose to him instead, he'd have been pissed at her for taking over what he wanted to do. I agree that who proposes shouldn't be gendered at all. Whoever does the proposing, however, should take into account what their partner likes. For example, I'm an introvert, so if I was to be proposed to, I'd want it to be in private; however, if I was doing the proposing and the person I loved wanted something public, I'd try to plan a way for that to work within my comfort zone. It's definitely about compromise and working together.", "Lol but the answer to that would generally be no tho. She is in the bath to relax and have some alone time after a 14 hr day, so let her relax.", "This is the wrong take, who wants to experience a super memorable moment in their life naked and soaking wet? \n\nThere wasn't even an ounce of effort in his proposal.", "not particularly, because after three and a half years of living with someone? that someone ought to know where i want/need to be after a day like that.\n\nmy roommate, for instance\u2014 always wanted to see me after i got home from work and make small talk and hang together soon as i got in the door. it took a couple times telling them politely before i had to be blunt in explaining: that i am Peopled Out when i get home. i need 30 minutes to an hour to decompress and relax by myself before i can interact with anyone else otherwise i will be irritable and snap at them because i'm at the end of my rope. guess what that roommate does now? *leaves me be when i get home unless i initiate the interaction*. they respect my space and my recharge process.\n\nand that's a *roommate*. you would think a wannabe fiance would be at least as intuitive and considerate as a platonic roommate.", "Yea, that is an odd read of it.

He didn\u2019t think about your style or feelings, and whilst I agree with others that have said you don\u2019t need a big proposal or flashy ring, the way your proposal is done needs to be thoughtful and considerate of you as a couple and he didn\u2019t think. But I would also ask, do you think this is representative of something bigger in your relationship and whether this is right for you? I know people who got engaged with a ring pop and didn\u2019t think twice and i know people who got engaged with a beautiful heirloom ring but it wasn\u2019t her taste and she felt uncomfortable about having a \u201csecond hand\u201d ring but her partner insisted that was the only ring he would ever propose with and discounted her feelings. They got divorced three years later. Food for thought.", "NTA. The first time I was engaged, my bf at the time proposed after his Air Force graduation on the air field\u2026 in front of thousands of people. I felt like I had to say yes because of the circumstances. To top it off I hated the ring. I eventually ended our engagement because I didn\u2019t want to be a military wife, I wanted to go to college. \n\nWith my current husband I expressed to him how much I hated my prior engagement and only wanted it to be the two of us when the time comes. I also told him I hated the ring and he let me choose 3 in our price range and he would pick out of those options. I mean, he did pick my favorite one so I lucked out. \ud83d\ude02 moral of the story, the right guy will listen to your wants and needs. \nYou\u2019re not vane for wanting a nice ring or a sweet proposal. It sounds like he hasn\u2019t really been listening to what you want at all. Whether that be because he pulled the trigger first and then realize oh shit, she doesn\u2019t like it.

I hope you are able to resolve this issue.", "He shouldn\u2019t have asked for your feedback after buying the ring if he wasn\u2019t willing to adjust based on it.

And now you\u2019re in such a weird position: wear something every day, forever that you don\u2019t like or waste his money. I do think he tried with the ring - at first, but he really, really should have fixed it the moment he understood you didn\u2019t like it. Idk man. I guess at this point if you do want to marry him, I\u2019d consider trying to contact the vendor for a return past the return date, or selling it online, or\u2026 something? It sucks you have to do any of this. Also, his proposal does seem like another not-well-thought-out move. I would not want to make a major decision while being the only person naked and vulnerable after a stressful day. (Although if you REALLY wanted to marry him maybe it wouldn\u2019t matter?)

Now a week or two before on a whim he spent \u00a3800 or \u00a3900 on a mountain bike before having it customised further, knowing he wanted to get engaged and what his finances were.\n\n When I turned up he showed me the ring with a VERY small stone not sure you can say it\u2019s a stone and not diamond dust and not costing much more than \u00a3100+. He was so happy showing me it and then mentioned it was one he liked in his price range. Now I liked the design of the band but it hurt knowing his impulse to get a bike he\u2019d hardly use was more important to him than me and a ring I\u2019d wear for life. Yet I sucked it up knowing then that was his price range.   \nI still love the ring as it was from him but I remember when people asked to see they would smile but go quiet. Then a young 17 year old in my work got engaged a couple of weeks later.

I think people like to downplay engagement ring style importance, but it\u2019s a ring you\u2019re literally supposed to wear everyday. I wouldn\u2019t want an exact replica of a video game stone either, it likely looks a bit like costume jewelry. I would sell the ring and get a new one if you can\u2019t return.

I would spin, and time, every ring we were thinking about. We went to 8 or 9 different stores and then she just bought the cheapest one she could find and didnt even spin it. We were divorced 2 years later. Not due to the ring but it was forshadowing the way she felt about my feelings and opinions. \n\nWhat ring did i get her you ask?

I have thought for years that it's weird for a partner to choose the jewelery his partner wears for the rest of their life. I know more than a few women who don't like their engagement rings and NONE of them don't like it due to the size of the diamond. It's not about these women wishing they had a more expensive ring, it's always about how it's not the ring they would have chosen.

I\u2019ve been with my partner nearly ten years. I wanted to get engaged a long time ago. But I know that it\u2019s very important to my partner that we\u2019re in a certain kind of financial place so we can actually afford a ring and a wedding- which I am by far the primary earner, so I had to come to accept that we wouldn\u2019t be engaged till I had our financials sorted. Fine (partner is a vet tech, and makes up for the low income with at cost veterinary services for my menagerie\u2019s through his job and loves what he does.) But I\u2019ve also been clear that I will not be \u201cbuying my own ring\u201d ie yeah in a sense I\u2019ll be paying for it, but it\u2019s on him to put the effort in to get the ring right.

Definitely NTA.", "Agreed.. if he puts this little effort into something this important to you.. it's just going to get worse from here. Your expectations will never be met, no matter how clear you are, and he will always put in the least amount of effort to get by.

I figured I'd take her to a beautiful hill overlooking a local loch where we went on one of our early dates, take a picnic and amongst the snacks are a couple of Kinder eggs. I'd have carefully put the ring in the casing and remelted the egg back together and refoiled it. So when we went to open our eggs together, hers had an engagement ring inside.\n\n\n...but yeah if there was no context and he just tossed it in a bath.

That way when I see them using my gift or having it on display at their house or something would make me happy.", "Yeah as you said I think an engagement ring is definitely not just a regular gift and is something you do need the recipient's input on because they're the one that's expected to wear the thing every day for the rest of their life. If someone gives you a heartfelt but misguided Christmas present you can effusively thank them, shove it in a drawer and regift it or something later. You can't do that with an engagement ring!", ">I tend to find it a bit tacky when people over-communicate what they want for gifts, because gifts are supposed to come from the giver\n\nIf it\u2019s a pair of socks, yes, but this is something that you HAVE to love and enjoy wearing every single day for the rest of your life. Some guys are just terrible at picking things out and their future fianc\u00e9es know this. Sometimes a little guidance goes a long way.", ">He later showed me pictures of rings he found online that were replicas of the Zora Sapphire with silver bands.

She literally prepared a folder of ring examples for him to use as a reference, and found sellers that do similar work. \n\nHe dropped the ring in her bath water in a kinderegg.

I have never bought her any silver jewelery.\n\nI cannot criticise OP for thinking she's not ready (she may not have said it, but there is a very real possibility that this relationship is possibly not for her, especially if her boyfriend is just stomping all over her preferences with what he wants).", "What you say about the colour is spot on. I only wear gold jewellery, so if it were me and I was proposed to with a silver ring, I would not be happy either. Also, a partner is supposed to know the kind of jewellery you wear after 3,5 years. For me, it should be clear that I only wear gold, a partner should notice. NTA.", "They should also ask the seller or a jeweler if they can keep the stone and whatever else they like and replace the band. Perhaps it will be a better price.", "Agreed. My partner can go to the store and buy things. He's not an idiot.", "Cannot agree more. My husband picked out my ring which I absolutely love, even years later. It\u2019s the type of style, material and cut I liked which he inquired about beforehand. Men are perfectly capable of picking out thoughtful presents, if they really want to.", "Woman married 20+ years. My husband does most of the shopping. If there's any chance of confusion he will ask me to text him a photo of exactly what I want. If someone acts incompetent in shopping, or anything, they are either hoping to do it poorly to avoid having to do it again, or they just don't care about your desires and feelings.", "Yes! Good fucking Lord. Men can shop and be thoughtful and are not just idiots bumbling along waiting for their angel woman to tell them how to do basic tasks.", "oooh which final fantasy?", "Indeed. This is the part that's puzzling. What kind of man proposes with a ring he knows his GF hates?! What did he think was gonna happen here?", "My thoughts exactly, I would far rather waste money and buy another, rather than give someone something they told me they didn't like. \nDid they think if they waited 4 months, OP would have forgotten that they preferred the gold one? Lol", "He could\u2019ve come clean then and explained what had happened rather than proposing with a ring she clearly said she hated. But yeah 4 months was enough time to figure *something* out", "He could have also told her he already bought the silver one and then they, together, figure out how to deal with that.  He had options.", "They can probably have it reset in gold. It wouldn\u2019t cost nearly as much as replacing or the loss they\u2019d take on selling. The stones are the most expensive part.", "Some people really love thinking the worst about people. Stupidity isn't always malice.", "Eh. Diamonds are only valuable because of marketing. It's a scam. Emeralds and rubies are way better IMO!", "how old are you? are you married?", "$20k for a wedding? Is that a wedding for poor people or what? Just flowers cost more than that.", "Oh, its in the US\u2026 oh well\u2026", "I just answered your question. I didn\u2019t even take a stance with you. Personally I think they both suck, and do find it a bit annoying that very few people here are willing to criticize both parties at all. \n\nBut, you\u2019re putting a lot on a comment that was 50% your words and 50% OP\u2019s.", "My partner didn't know that gold doesn't suit me, so I told him. I don't wear a lot of jewellery, so there wasn't much to go off. \n\nWe looked at rings together and I pointed out things I like. He got me a lovely ring and a beautiful proposal. OP is definitely not the asshole, she was really clear about what she wanted.", "Also married and yes same! My husband knows my sizes, favorite colors, and keeps a running list of the stuff I mention for gifting purposes. I can give him a list and if any substitutions are needed, he\u2019ll text to make sure it\u2019s okay (ie if the name brand is out of stock).", "FF8 Rinoa's double ring necklace.", "tbh? My husband wouldn't want to go through the effort of filing for the return and the process of sending it back. But, because he's my husband, he'd do it. This is a guy who doesn't want to do any extra effort, because it's not personally affecting him (YET).", "Or he was waiting out the return policy till it was a \u201ccan\u2019t return it\u201d situation but that could just be cynicism.", "Yeah, if I was in his shoes I would 100% mention it. He had already asked her about her ring size, so it wouldn't have ruined it for her.", "Never thought of that! That's genius.", "Practically, that's the smartest ting to do. But she would still have to look at that ring every dag, knowing she had to \"fix\" it,  because her partner didn't bother taking her wishes into consideration. In my eyes that ring would be tainted. And also associated with that half assed proposal.", "Since it seems to be the aesthetic and not the metal itself, they could have it gold plated for much cheaper. If that's an issue.", "She did way more than \u201cthe fucking minimum\u201d!", "It also depends on where you live. The average in my state (Tennessee) is $22,000, but the average in New Jersey (the highest) is $51,000. \n\nBut tbh I was surprised as well because $22,000 seems low based on how insanely expensive everything related to a wedding is. It probably also includes courthouse weddings and elopements... and maybe it doesn't include the dress and tux and such?", "Why do they both suck?\n\nShe practically did 90% of the work, handed it to him with a pretty bow on top, and he still fucked it up.\n\nYou seriously expect her to be willing to marry a guy that incompetent?!", "ooh that's beautiful!", "So... she just needs to find another man because he fucked up the ring? I mean i agree that she's allowed to be pissed and not like it. I don't understand how him fixing his mistake would still leave the ring tainted. No such thing as forgiveness in aita?", "Oh yeah, giving directions about the ring is totally the bulk of the job, not the planning, purchasing, accounting for unforseen corcumstances and coordinating both their schedules and managing his other personal affairs in the meantime. I understand you think OP is right to reject the proposal, and fair enough, but lets not act like not expecting her SO to read her mind and giving him directions about the ring is anything other than the bare minimum", "Yeah, you described very well why **he** sucks and I fully agree with all that!\n\nShe communicated well, he did not. \n\nBut, if she loves him (which I am to presume she does, still, despite all this), then she should have handled it differently. She absolutely just traumatized him with one of a man\u2019s absolute worst nightmares because of his mistake. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine my wife rejecting a wedding proposal when \u201cyes! Of course I\u2019ll marry you! But we really have to exchange that awful ring\u201d would have worked just as well. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine if my wife treated all of my dumb moments where I overthink things with the same scrutiny as this godforsaken subreddit.", "It was even expensive like 250 but it's literally the thought and effort. I feel bad for op nobody wants to be proposed to after a 13.5 hour shift, naked in a tub with an Easter egg.", "I agree. She should just let him go find someone that\u2019s not so shallow. It\u2019s ok to be disappointed, but to not accept the engagement over this is extremely superficial. A lot of couples get another ring after they are engaged if bride doesn\u2019t like it.", "I mean, it says clearly that the two of them talked about engagement countless times, so he likely made it clear what he wanted to. I'm one of the first people to call out double standards, but this post isn't that.", "This. I\u2019m sure anyone who knows me would assume the same about me but I would\u2019ve been beyond overjoyed if my wife had proposed to me instead. Even if I\u2019d already made plans.", "Except she planned all that, too!\n\nShe provided a range of prices, most of which were considerably less than \u201chalf his monthly income.\u201d\n\nShe provided him *direct links to specific stores.*\n\nShe practically held his damn hand through it all, and he still fucked up!\n\nYet here you are, desperately defending an incompetent idiot.", "for real! I've shown my fiancee one (1) symbol from my favorite FF game that i want as a tattoo, and the other day she sent me a link to one of my favorite jewelry artists saying they were going to open preorders for a necklace with that as a charm.", "I sincerely doubt any of those conversations were about what *he* wanted, and even if they were that doesnt mean he would be against her proposing to him instead. In threads like these people frequently pull that excuse but that one time OP (the dude) wanted a reciprocal proposal they called him ridicolous lmfao", "Lmfao she gave him directions about the ring. Sending a link and making sure the price isnt too much is not \"holding his hand through it all\". \n\nIm not engaging with you anymore, anyone willing to call someone they dont know an \"incompetent idiot\" over a one-sided account is not someone im interested in having a conversation with. Excuse me for forgetting that the benefit of the doubt and grace is reserved exclusively for women on this sub.", "I think reciprocal proposals should be the norm honestly. However, I think it's presumptive to assume that he never once said what he wanted in all these conversations. And I've met many men who act like a woman proposing is the most emasculating thing she can do to them (as messed up as that is).", "Yes, she gave him directions!\n\nExplicit directions! \n\nAnd what did he do?\n\nGot the *one* ring she told him she did not want.\n\nWhat if he did that with a house? A car? A pet? Something she would be *financially liable* for?\n\nAgain: you are going to ridiculous lengths to defend an incompetent man. \n\nWhy should any woman tie herself to a man who blatantly ignores her like that?"]}
