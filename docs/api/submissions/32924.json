The hospital - by which I assume you mean the ER - is NOT meant for non urgent cases like a cold symptoms.  They\u2019re meant for actual *emergencies*, like a suspected heart attack or possible stroke.  The medical staff that work the ER have to be free to work those emergencies - to be able to deal with patients who just got into a car crash and have severe trauma, for example.  If they\u2019re being bothered by parents who need someone to look after little Billy\u2019s sniffles, who\u2019s going to be there to stop Jane Doe from going into a second cardiac arrest?\n\nThere are \u201curgent care\u201d centers that will see patients on a walk-in basis, that can deal with things like sudden cold or flu symptoms.  Use those if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t make an appointment with your PCP.  Leave the ER to people with *actual* emergencies.\n\nOn a side note, people abusing the ER is one of the reasons why health care costs are out of control.\n\nSource:  I was a pharmacy technician for 15 years, and now I\u2019m a MLT.  I see first hand how many people abuse the ER, and how it drives up both waiting times AND costs for *everyone*.", "I think that\u2019s a really strange perspective. I have joint custody of my kid and all medical expenses are required to be split 50/50. You can\u2019t necessarily control when a kid gets sick and if you think that the cost of that should fall on whatever parent just happens to have physical custody when the child gets sick then you run the risk of the parents playing hot potato with a sick kid so they don\u2019t get saddles with the cost. That being said, my parenting arrangement also basically requires the parent with the higher income to provide health insurance for the child and if neither parent makes enough to afford it then the kid should qualify for the state health care program. I think the fact that the children are on OPs new spouses health care plan could potentially give the dad some leverage to argue out of the expense since if the kids do qualify for Medicaid then there may be a $0 copay. That being said, OP and her ex are both losers for even arguing over 25 dollars for their sick kid. If my ex told me she couldn\u2019t pay that or even half that then I would just pay the damn bill and put it behind me. ESH", "I disagree. She was responsible enough to take the child to the doctor. GF did right by the child. She did not understand the insurance and anyway, dad\u2019s responsibility.", "Not really sure the comment about the gf being unsafe due to not knowing about copays is really fair. This is ultimately the fault of the dad.", "Eh, girlfriend, probably knew that the boyfriend/dad would never pay her back if she paid it on her own", "He lives on section 8, food stamps, Medicaid, he gets a lot of assistance from the government. That\u2019s why he\u2019s mentality has changed, when we were married he always tried to provide for his family. Now it seems he\u2019s become dependent on government assistance and us to pick up his slack.", "What does it mean to man up? I really hate this term for men, and it makes me sad for them when I see it. \n\nHe\u2019s a parent and he needs to start acting like one. < might be a better way to phrase that.", "It might be higher but they don\u2019t pay up front.", "No, they didn\u2019t get taken to the hospital.. he paid the copay and the got seen at the clinic.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting downvoted for this. It definitely had some positives but overwhelmingly, lately, I look around and think, \u201cdamn, I hate it here.\u201d", "They did.", "Yes, I think this is a problem, that he's not respecting this aspect of the divorce decree. The children's emergency medical care shouldn't be dependent on you being available at a moment's notice to transfer money to your ex-husband's girlfriend. So if you were busy when she contacted you, or there was an internet problem getting the bank to send the money, the girls wouldn't have been treated?", "It\u2019s really strange that medical expenses are part of that instead of just being split. It encourages a parent to push off the kids treatment until they are with the other parent. Children\u2019s medical expenses should be split 50/50", "Honestly, wouldn't it be $25 per child? Not that $50 is bad, but typically it's a copay per person.", "I counsel patients about their insurance as part of my job\u2026it doesn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest.", "I work front office for a dr. Most people don\u2019t understand their insurance at all.", "and she likely was not able to consent to treatment as a gf of the father....", "I\u2019m from the UK and we don\u2019t have such a thing but it\u2019s a very easy concept to understand. It\u2019s really weird that she couldn\u2019t!", "Part of my job is to counsel patients on their health insurance benefits. A lot of people don\u2019t understand-usually because they don\u2019t use their insurance very often. If you have any questions, PM me! I love explaining insurance and helping people understand how to use it to their benefit (or expose their employer for providing shit healthcare).", "For their health and safety, you can go back to court and ask for a temporary modification to the custody agreement considering he can't meet his obligations under the current agreement. Maybe you offer to waive the premiums in return for reducing visitation. This isn't a punishment. This is making sure as a parent that your child will get medical care whenever it's needed. As soon as he is in a position to provide for that basic need, visitation can go back to normal.", "That\u2019s fine for short term. But it\u2019s concerning that he thinks it\u2019s the easy solution for everyone. \nAssistance isn\u2019t supposed to be for life, and it\u2019s not a great thing to be highlighting for kids.", "USA here - I had a perforated ulcer that hit a vein and I almost bled out on the sidewalk outside my office.  My 6 day visit (including surgery and blood transfusions) was $200 and my ambulance ride was $200.   $400 total.  Subsequent visits were $30 copays - meds were about $15/month.  I had multiple scopes to see if the ulcer had healed enough  -  nothing for those.  I pay $265/mo for a family plan insurance.  I've retired since and have the same plan.  I worked hard in my profession, have good insurance and life is great here in the USA for me.  I do take a biologic that is rather expensive in the non-insured world . . . but my co-pay is $5 every 3 month.", "It\u2019s just a term. There are millions of them and we can\u2019t let them all get us down. It\u2019s much more empowering to let them go. \n\nI\u2019m not dismissing you and I understand where you are coming from. You are also being very respectful and I appreciate that.  However, I\u2019ve been around for a long time and have given much thought into many things especially in regards to human behavior and sociology. I strongly believe we have lost balance and good intentions have tipped the scale to being more hurtful with regards to words in many ways. \n\nImagine life where you didn\u2019t feel words as heavily and there was nobody else telling you to be offended by them. It\u2019s so much more peaceful. Trust me on that. \n\nI get that in the fight for respect and all of its aspects the intended target is for the ones saying the words. However the fighting lands on the people who are receiving them and often times much more so. If you are constantly told \u201cThey are not being kind. That was hurtful to you. They have no respect for you. If they say the wrong term then they hate you or this group of people\u201d how does that make you feel? It would make most feel like complete shit that the world is against them and that could also lead them to hate a lot of people unnecessarily in defense, people who never meant to hurt anyone. \n\nSo the \u201cman up\u201d is not meant as anything other than be an adult and not a young boy or simply to be mature. He just so happens to be a man and that\u2019s why the term fits.  It isn\u2019t to put men as a whole down or to make them carry the weight of masculinity at all or any time. It\u2019s not that complex. \n\nThe other day I got hammered for using the term \u201cfemales.\u201d I was called vile and other wonderful terms. It was apparently decided a year or so ago that women should be offended by that. In no other time in history was that offensive but someone decided it was and that caught on. So they were too because they were told to be and in turn acted horrible towards me. What they didn\u2019t know is that I am a woman and a woman who was all about women empowerment back in the day (I\u2019m 50). I couldn\u2019t fathom for the life of me how it\u2019s empowering to get upset over a simple word, let alone with no insulting intention for starters. \u201cI am woman hear me roar unless you use a term I don\u2019t like or I will fall apart\u201d wasn\u2019t the motto. It doesn\u2019t make us look like we can handle shit to be honest. I also couldn\u2019t understand what term I was suppose to use. You see, I was commenting to a man with a son he was defending from his daughter and his wife. The young girl wasn\u2019t a woman and the mother was no longer a girl. So using women or girls was not an option. I knew \u201cladies\u201d was offensive for some other unknown reason. It was also becoming redundant to use \u201cyour wife and daughter\u201d so I said \u201cI think you owe the females in your life an apology\u201d.  Then they came for me with virtual pitchforks and torches. \n\nSo I had to look up why there was another new rule to live by. It\u2019s exhausting and it\u2019s doing nothing but having people be extremely mean to one another and honestly, we have much bigger fish to fry. I don\u2019t really care if someone called me lady, female, asshole or anything. I\u2019m stronger than that and that is because of feeling empowered not feeling hurt because I\u2019m constantly told I should be. Then that gives me the confidence to stand up when someone is actually being hurtful to another by being a racist, a homophobe, a predator, etc.\n\nSo where I do appreciate where you are coming from and know your intentions are good I just don\u2019t see where the benefits of changing up how people speak outweigh the bad unless it\u2019s clearly meant to be derogatory.", "Why even go to the clinic for a cold?\nMaybe this is a Sweden thing, but we basically have a cold for 6 months of the year. You don't stay at home, and you sure as shit don't go bothering a doctor about it.", "The hospital is for emergency care. Not for a child with a mild cold.", "My phone was on vibrate so I did receive a few calls before answering. I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve figured it out the way they did. But it is frustrating to have them depend on us whenever something like this happens.", "It is, he\u2019s supposed to reimburse me for premium costs. As well as cover copays when the children are with him - as I cover all of their expenses when they are with me.", "Yes. The parent who carries insurance can change plans whenever they want as long as the kids are insured.", "She didn't have any insurance for the children since she's unemployed what was she supposed to do?!", "Seriously? Insurance is tied to your job in the US. How else do you see that going for anyone when they quit that job? On another note I\u2019ve been with the same company for 8 years & we have changed insurance 4 times. Company is always on the lookout for anything cheaper they can find. I can\u2019t imagine mine is the only one. Does that mean I can\u2019t take that new insurance on Jan. 1st for my ex\u2019s kid because it would be a \u201cunilateral \u201d change?", "I\u2019m paying for health insurance. I may do any changes as long as my kids have medical and dental insurance. \nI\u2019m not obligated to ask him if it\u2019s okay to change insurances that\u2019s just weird to think.", "You\u2019re really stuck on that, huh? When she and her husband are paying the premiums, dad doesn\u2019t have anything to bitch about.", "Some private offices will fudged the billing to help lower income families, if both kids come in for the same thing, they bill it as one office visit.", "Can you imagine having to explain deductible and coinsurance? I used to work patient accounts owing in a medical billing office. The number of times I spent having to break down insurance terms and how each part works and when...", "the idea that different visits have different amounts you owe and then the insurance pays the rest had to be explained more than once?", "No, it meant she didn't need that knowledge before.", "I agree.", "~15% of salary in taxes in most EU countries. Do the math for an average household.", "It\u2019s not a matter of not \u201cwanting\u201d to deny their visits, she legally cannot. She could be held in contempt and even *go to jail* for a few days. Custody is messy. OP is doing the right things here. \n\nOP, you really should have your lawyer file a complaint about your ex violating support orders.", "Not gonna read that. Telling men to man up is toxic as fuck and is detrimental to their mental health. Isn\u2019t \u201cget your shit together\u201d a better option than \u201cman up\u201d? What about women who need to get their shit together? Do you also tell them to man up? It\u2019s pathetic and language matters. \n\nThere are a lot of very bad men out there who hold positions of power. Are they not considered men?\n\nIt\u2019s dismissive as fuck and men deserve better.", "A pediatrician is a GP that specializes in kid diseases.", "Huh? \nKids go to pediatricians. That is their GP.", "You weren\u2019t embarrassed to type this?", "The girlfriend, is not a babysitter or nanny for the mom. She's a babysitter/nanny for the Dad. \n\nMy guess is his kids with his girlfriend aren't actually his kids on paper and they are eligible for Medicaid and other government programs because of it.", "They were in the care of their father. They\u2019re supposed to be taken care of by him during his custodial time.", "Honestly, them relying on you to fix stuff like this is going to be a big issue going forward. Then again, it\u2019s your children, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to just not pick up. This is a crap situation and you have my sympathy!", "He himself doesn\u2019t have health insurance. And his other 2 kids are covered by state Medicaid.", "Exactly, both insurances are private which meant they both had copays. Except our premium went up, which doesn\u2019t affect my ex at all since he isn\u2019t the one paying for that.", "Understood. I only have one child, so wasn't sure. Thank you!!", "He supports his children but wants them on medicaid so he doesn't have to pay a $25 copay...after he hasn't contributed to the cost of the insurance? Yeah, sounds like he's able to support his children.", "The red flag about the dad is that he is the breadwinner for his family, yet his girlfriend doesn't have access to the money without his permission. That's completely different from OP's situation.\n\nSingle income homes work and can be awesome for the kids, but I don't see them working with separate finances. That's just asking for financial abuse.", "None of that has anything to do with anything. Her family\u2019s finances have no relevance.", "Tbf, at least where I grew up in the midwestern US with lackluster parents, nobody actually teaches anybody about insurance. School or otherwise. Everything I\u2019ve learned about insurance, I\u2019ve had to either glean from adults\u2019 conversations as a kid, or look up on my own.", "I'm a licensed Health Insurance Agent in my state and the amount of people who don't know the difference between copay, deductible and co-insurance is amazing", "That is basically what I do every day for transplant patients. I don\u2019t mind it usually, it only gets challenging when a patient is misinformed going into our visit. For some, they struggle to let go of the misinformation as they may have heard it from a source they trust. Other times, patients are overwhelmed and only remember certain parts and fill in the blanks incorrectly.", "They were covered under my health insurance with my job. I quit my job recently and that\u2019s when my husband added all of us to his health insurance. We were able to make the change since we qualified under SEP. I worked directly with the insurance company so my premium was $200 monthly vs my husbands that\u2019s $675 monthly. it made sense for me to carry the insurance to save money for the past years. I didn\u2019t notify my ex husband because it didn\u2019t really cross my mind. I had been with the same insurance for years and when my husband added us to his health plan my insurance was still active. We\u2019ve only had this new insurance for November and December. And my previous insurance expired December 1st. When they left to visit I didn\u2019t really think about them going to the doctor since they weren\u2019t sick and hardly get ill. But, things do happen.. I understand that.", "My guess is the girlfriend and him may have kids together but they probably aren't his on paper, especially if you aren't getting your back child support paid off every tax season. The government will happily garnish tax refunds for back child support.", "I'm not saying you should deny him his visits, I'm saying if he's not actually taking the kids 50/50 like the court order says, it is time to make the paperwork match reality. In a lot of places, having \"50/50\" means much lower child support payments. If he's getting the benefit without doing the work, it's time that stops. It may also help to look into other support enforcement options- for example, where I live, if the payment isn't being made they will scoop any and all government payments like tax refunds or pensions to satisfy the order, and if that doesn't do it, they start the process of revoking/refusing to issue hunting and fishing licenses, drivers licenses, and other government issued permits of any kind. Then they come for your bank accounts and other property. It's a pain in the ass to get the process started and a long wait, but once they are on it, they're on it.", "I didn\u2019t say anything about denying visits. I\u2019m talking about the big picture which involves going to court. It\u2019s clear that OP is just letting things go to not rock the boat or change the agreement. \n\nOP absolutely can go to court and have them review everything and point out where he has failed to abide by the order. She has chosen not to. I am saying that she should.", "I was just meaning I\u2019d he didn\u2019t like how you handled insurance- he could do it himself. Clearly he won\u2019t but those are his options.", "Like I said \u201che had\u201d (past tense) able to support the kids. This was when him and I were married. He\u2019s changed a lot once he was put on child support and I remarried.", "We usually do see some during tax season.. it\u2019s never the full amount he owes but usually $500-$1,000", "Yeah, I definitely agree and know where you\u2019re coming from.. my husband and I sometimes get very angry and talk about hiring a lawyer and getting it to where it\u2019s fair.. we never actually go through with the process.. it\u2019s always among the lines of - let it go, the girls will grow and eventually refuse to visit, we don\u2019t need his money or support for the girls.. thankfully we are financially stable to where we are able to afford to fully take care of them when they are with us.", "Yeah because while op has money even if  she quit. Her job and is partially relying on her husband, it appears at least from what I read the ex is financially abusing his gf by not giving her money.  \n\nAlso the father/op s ex was sick and I didn't see anything about him trying to isolate himself to keep the kids healthy, hence he is responsible for them being sick and for paying  for doctor's visits and medicine.\n\nAlso since op quit and the kids were on her job s medical insurance what was she supposed. Yup do let the children without medical Insurance?! \n\nNTA OP your ex is."]}
