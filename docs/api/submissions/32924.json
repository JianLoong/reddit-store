He told me he was taking  them to the pediatrician so I let him know we changed insurances and texted him a picture of our new ID card. A few hours passed and I received a call from his girlfriend letting me know she was the one that took the girls to the clinic but they\u2019re letting her know the girls insurance isn\u2019t active. I told her it had changed and I would text her the ID card, to call me back if she didn\u2019t receive the text. A few minutes passed and she did call me but to let me know my new insurance wasn\u2019t covering the visit, I was confused because I\u2019ve used it before and had no issues. When she passed the phone to the receptionist she let me know they are in network and there isn\u2019t a problem with the insurance, there\u2019s just a $25 copay.

And honestly, I do not care nor does my husband. But I do feel the least he could do is cover a $25 copay. I feel like an asshole but at the same time tired of him not appreciating that I\u2019m the main care giver and even though we have 50/50 custody I have them throughout the year and my husband and I pay for all of their expenses.\n\n\nSo, AITA for just not paying for the copay?\n\nEDIT: \n\nI just want to add, I did text his girlfriend after I received his text message and let her know they could take them to the hospital and not be charged upfront.

By letting your ex get away with 50/50 on paper only, you are depriving your kids of financial support that they are owed.

Take that man back to court, have your custody adjusted to reflect reality, and get a child support order.

What I hear of US healthcare sounds horrific to me!   I\u2019ve got cancer and (not including diagnostics) have so far had surgery plus a week long hospital stay after it to recovery, 6 months of chemotherapy once a week, 2x week long hospital stays due to infections on chemo.    Next step is probably more scans then radiotherapy.
