My oldest 2 daughters (7F & 9F) are from a previous marriage.. My girls went to visit their dad (30M) and unfortunately got a cold. He gave them medicine but it seemed to not be working. He told me he was taking  them to the pediatrician so I let him know we changed insurances and texted him a picture of our new ID card. A few hours passed and I received a call from his girlfriend letting me know she was the one that took the girls to the clinic but they\u2019re letting her know the girls insurance isn\u2019t active. I told her it had changed and I would text her the ID card, to call me back if she didn\u2019t receive the text. A few minutes passed and she did call me but to let me know my new insurance wasn\u2019t covering the visit, I was confused because I\u2019ve used it before and had no issues. When she passed the phone to the receptionist she let me know they are in network and there isn\u2019t a problem with the insurance, there\u2019s just a $25 copay. When she handed the phone back to her I let her know they are just charging the copay but they are covered. She seemed very confused as I was trying to explain that\u2019s how insurances work.. she asked \u201cso then I have to pay this?\u201d which I responded \u201cwell, not you.. but their dad does\u201d then she said \u201cok let me call him to see if he\u2019s able to transfer me money\u201d. I then got an angry text from the girls dad saying how he can\u2019t afford the copay and that the girls should just have Medicaid so it could be free. I didn\u2019t respond. \n\nBTW we live in different states\n\nBefore, I would\u2019ve offered to pay immediately.. because at the end of the day they are my kids. But then again, even before my husband added us to his health insurance, I carried the girls on my health insurance through my job. He\u2019s supposed to reimburse me but he doesn\u2019t. And honestly, I do not care nor does my husband. But I do feel the least he could do is cover a $25 copay. I feel like an asshole but at the same time tired of him not appreciating that I\u2019m the main care giver and even though we have 50/50 custody I have them throughout the year and my husband and I pay for all of their expenses.\n\n\nSo, AITA for just not paying for the copay?\n\nEDIT: \n\nI just want to add, I did text his girlfriend after I received his text message and let her know they could take them to the hospital and not be charged upfront. She texted back letting me know they were already being treated at the pediatricians office. \n", "created_utc": 1702435241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18h6h1c/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughters_medical/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agreed to carry insurance on the kids (I knew I couldn\u2019t trust him to keep insurance on them), then we were to split any out of pocket cost. He never reimbursed me, but was quick to want me to pay for any doctor visits on his time. Let him cover the co-pays.", "NTA - And I wouldn't let his gf look after the kids anymore. She is either way too young or she is't a safe adult due to a lack of knowledge about basic parenting things like insurance. The fact that she wasn't able to afford a $25 copay and just work it out with her bf later is not in her favor. Emergencies happen and if she is \\*that financially unprepared\\* she shouldn't be in charge of the kids. Same goes for their dad.", "NTA. 50/50 custody means splitting the bills. This more than just the $. A good dad would find a way to pay the $25 for his kids to be healthy, no matter what. A shitty dad will take any excuse not to pay it , no matter what", "NTA. He is not reimbursing you for the cost of health insurance and he wants to get mad at you for not paying a $25 copay? That\u2019s rich.\nAlso, he can ask to be billed for the copay. There are a lot of offices that do that.", "NTA.

Their dad can find the money to take HIS KIDS to the doctor.", "I\u2019m very uncomfortable with letting your sick kids go without or delay health care because you\u2019re annoyed their dad sucks. \n\nYes, he should cough up the copay. Absolutely.\n\nBut he\u2019s not the one who is suffering when he doesn\u2019t do it. \n\nESH, him the most, the kids not at all. I hope they\u2019re feeling better.", "INFO: Is he really that broke he can\u2019t afford a $25 copay? Also why aren\u2019t you using Medicaid if he claims it\u2019ll cover it?", "Esh because the people who are suffering are your daughters. They are the ones you\u2019re truly hurting.", "YTA only because you sent them sick and you knew they weren't getting better. You should have kept them home or took them to the doctor yourself before they went. They got sick when they were with you.", "I would have paid so that my children could see a damn doctor.  YTA.  Wrong time to try to teach him and his dumbass girlfriend a lesson.", "Yta.", "Gotta love how he didn't even take them himself, he had his GF do it. Dad of the year.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, if their father cant cover $25 for medical needs, the girls shouldn't be going to him at this point in time. I'm not going to pretend ik his situation, he could be on hard times for all I know but that doesn't change the fact that he can't afford to take care of the girls.", "As per the judge that granted our divorce, you are right. While they are with him, he is responsible for all their expenses.", "Somewhat similar story: sister-in-law's sister passed away leaving behind a teenage daughter and an ex-husband. SIL is the executor of the estate. The ex kept harping on SIL for \"the estate's half\" of daughter's copays for a few visits. We are talking less than $200 total and he basically harassed my SIL about it for months. Nevermind these were copays for HIS daughter and that the same daughter had lost her mother, who was the primary parent. Nope; none of that mattered. All that mattered was her estate continuing to pay half the co-pay amount. Geez...", "I wasn\u2019t aware his gf was taking them. As far as I knew he was the one that was supposed to be there. In her defense, she\u2019s from Mexico so I understand that insurance works differently over there. But, she does have 2 kids with him so I don\u2019t think her watching over my girls while they visit will change anytime soon. Again, not trying to defend her, but she doesn\u2019t work.. so he\u2019s the only one that has an income in their household. I\u2019m not sure how their relationship goes money wise but it seems like he has his own money apart from hers. Since she said she needed him to transfer money to her.", "I'm more concerned she wasn't able to *understand* a $25 copay, but yes, all of this.", "None of this is on her. Their father is the loser here.", "Yeah - not the girlfriend\u2019s faults I\u2019d focus on in this situation.  Plus - of all the things that could make an adult \u201cnot safe\u201d, not knowing how co-pays work isn\u2019t one of them (for me).", "Tf? I\u2019m 30 and still don\u2019t understand insurance. The two are not mutually exclusive", "Even before I remarried, I always found a way to support my kids. Maybe that\u2019s why I feel that he should do the same..?", "I\u2019m very uncomfy with all of this as a Canadian lol. I can\u2019t even imagine having this fight over a simple doctors visit, but what is even crazier to me is that you are delaying your child getting care over a $25 charge and the fact that her dad is an ass. This is NOT the hill to die on.\n\nESH", "I didn\u2019t offer to pay but he didn\u2019t ask me to pay either.", "Medicaid has eligibility requirements, not every office accepts Medicaid, Medicaid in mothers state may not cover any claims in fathers state, and $25 copay is perfectly reasonable for a doctors visit. \n\nNTA", "I work in healthcare as an insurance coordinator: Medicaid does cover 100% for kids the problem is that it isn\u2019t accepted everywhere. Some states only have a few medical and dental offices that actually accept the state Medicaid insurance. My state for example only has 8 dental offices in the whole state that accept Medicaid. Imagine having to travel across the state to get seen in an already overwhelmed and under staffed office.", "Even if for some wonderful reason we qualified for Medicaid, it\u2019s given by the state. It wouldn\u2019t cover in another state unless it\u2019s an ER visit.", "I understand they might feel a little blue with a mild cold, but there\u2019s other options - like taking them to the hospital. There\u2019s not upfront charge with our health insurance.", "Where does it say she sent them while they were sick? It says the kids were visiting their dad and caught a cold.", "I didn\u2019t send them sick. Like I said, we live in different states. They got sick while they were visiting. I\u2019m not sure how you got to this conclusion they were sick while they were with me.", "Hang on, so he works and she doesn't, she has two kids with him, there is a cultural difference and she has to ask him for money. \n\nJust think about that for a second and consider how you would react if she was your daughter. I know it's not the issue here and your NTA for making him pay for medical aid on his time but were there that many red flags in yoyr relationship with him and that's why you divorced.", "The person who said the true AH here was the American \u201chealth care system\u201d (which manages to completely fail all three of those words, frankly) had it bang on.", "Right!\n\nAlso, a Canadian.   I spent 4 hours in urgent care last weekend with my daughter and needed an x-ray.  Cost me nothing.   Kids have a pediatrician appointment this week, and it's great knowing it will not cost me anything.  \n\nHaving to argue about $25 for a doctors appointment makes no sense to me.  Kids suffer cuz no one wants to fork out $25.", "Because likely it is all in GF\u2019s name.  Honestly - if he sticks this to the gf I\u2019d just pay the $50 since she was caring for your kids.", "Then, NTA. He\u2019s her parent too.", "Sorry I mistread that as you sent them with the meds. If it makes a difference in sick lol I'll blame it on the fever \ud83e\udd12", "Yeah I feel like the asshole for not just offering to pay. Even though we already pay $150 weekly for health insurance."]}
