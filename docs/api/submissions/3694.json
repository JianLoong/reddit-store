If they stay there forever I\u2019m cool with it but if they are in someone else\u2019s house (my house, I know pointing that out makes me a asshole ) they have to follow their rules. Or they can get their own house and make their own rules \ud83d\ude2e", "Also this is my 1st (and probably the only) house I\u2019ve ever owned I should be able to brag a little \ud83d\ude0f", "I must be bad at communicating \ud83d\ude15 but honestly if they feel attacked and aren\u2019t comfortable living here they could always. . . . . Get their own place. Until then they might have to deal with some discomfort and rules set.", "My gf knew I was going to confront them. She wouldn\u2019t say anything. My gf is weird with her family. She\u2019d rather be quiet about anything than possibly getting them upset. So she agreed with me saying something. but afterwards when we were alone she told me someways I could have handled it better. Overall I agree with her.", "Check with your utility company too - sometimes they run deals or rebates on these thermostats. That's how I got a couple of mine.", "Yup, [Like this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4d/3f/4c/4d3f4c97fc9a528a1d7f80251bdb305a.jpg) or you can get one with a [combination lock.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71o5dtbeTOL._AC_UL800_QL65_.jpg)", "Yeah, they really make no sense at all. I think I'd make sure this is the last time they stay with you guys, though. \n\nIt's kinda common courtesy to just adapt to whatever your hosts normal stuff is (within reason, like if you were leaving the heat off and letting the house get below 50, that'd be different). \n\nI sincerely hope they have a solid move out date. After a couple months, in most places atleast, they would be considered a legal tenant and have rights that could make this way more complicated. Pro-tip : don't house people long term without a written lease. Even family.", "I get what you mean about sacrificing comfort but it might go a long way with your girlfriend if she sees you extending some grace with her family by being a little flexible. Even if you feel like you're already doing just that by letting them live there, it would still be a nice gesture for your girlfriend's sake.", "Of course! I agree with you. Set your rules, they need to follow them. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nIt\u2019s just more on HOW you communicate things. No one is perfect, and we all slip up. Just be a little more mindful, I guess. It\u2019s something that can always be worked on \u263a\ufe0f I know I still do!", "My electric provider has shitty deals (never more than $50 savings) but I asked my dad to pick one up for me and that saved me a couple hundred dollars.", "Thank you. This might be the way, though I feel like if I throw this on before they \u201cbreak the rule\u201d again I\u2019m gonna be seen as extra petty. \ud83e\udd23", "Well shit im going to look into the whole legal tenant thing. I was always comfortable with them staying as long as they want as long as they follow the rules and I can ask them to leave at any point.", "Yeah you\u2019re definitely right and thinking about it that was makes it a little more bearable", "Agreed you definitely need more work \ud83e\udd23 joking. It came across passive aggressive because it was. They are not working and they don\u2019t play bills. I shouldn\u2019t have to communicate about how to be a respectful person. Especially not in a \u201cnice\u201d way \ud83d\ude2d", "Yeah, may be best to give them a chance...", "This is a sure fire way to blow up your relationship with these people for no reason.  EVERYONE who has come into contact with these things hates them, hates the people who installed them, and knows how to get around them (wire, butter knife, ice cubes held near them).  This would be so antagonist for no reason.", "Definitely do and try to get a lease done, just to cover your ass. Hopefully it will never be an issue, but life has taught me to not trust anyone, even family, especially when money/housing is involved. If they're on the up and up, they'll have zero issue signing a lease, as it protects *both* parties.", "Yep just gonna go with the electric one that requires a code"]}
