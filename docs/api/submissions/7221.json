But the electronics team didn't comply because their leader (let's call him Bob) was on holiday and due to their toxic environment every other core member left the team. So, we had to work with a non-core team electronics member (Usually a junior with less knowledge about the subject) but we completed as much as possible and made clear to every team that we still have to do full software testing.

Everyone knows that Bob is an asshole but the last thread of patience was no one from any other team stood up for us even after half a day of this happening. This led to me and mike leaving the server after declaring that we will not be coming back to the workshop.

Software always gets blamed and schedule shorted.  Just because the problem can be fixed in the software doesn't always mean the software was at fault.  That is, if the hardware teams don't meet their specs but software team wrote the software to those specs, then the product will fail.  An investigation proves what the problem was.  Testing in part doesn't always work well.  All the testing still has to be done on the final product.\n\nThere was an iPhone that had a problem with an antenna causing calls to fail.  It was a hardware problem with an antenna.  Apple blamed software and tried to fix it with a software patch.  That didn't work well.

From what you've described, it sounds like there were a lot of factors at play that led to the failure of the software team in the competition. You and your friend Mike took steps to address the issues from last year, but were still met with resistance from the electronics team and a lack of support from other members.  \nIt's understandable that you would be upset and frustrated by the toxic behavior of Bob and the lack of support from other team members. It's also understandable that you would want to take a break from the work and the discord group, especially with exams coming up.  \nIt's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and that it's not always possible to control the actions of others. It's possible that the management team will be able to work things out with Bob and the other members of the team, but ultimately it's up to you and Mike to decide whether or not you want to return to the club.", "NTA | What happened when you weren't in charge last year is not your fault + it seems that even then it wasn't entirely up to the software team.\n\nAs far as the present problem is concerned it seems you gave adequate notice of what was needed and failure of other \"leaders\" is what resulted in the disqualification. Bob is clearly an asshole for being unreachable and no-one can blame you for taking a step back for your actual studies.\n\nSeems like a toxic environment of a team and it's probably best that you guys left.", "NTA. The keyword in this club is **teamwork**, therefore everyone needs to **work together** in order for a software, product, project etc to be successful.

Simple as.\n\nBob was the one who instigated the argument by insulting and blaming others for the failure. Nobody should have to 'suck it up'.

Bob would like to apologize nah Bob needs to step down himself.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, don't accept an apology with a \"but\". That's not a real apology.\n\nAlso realize that Bob isn't the only asshole - this was a major failing of the Management team as well, and they're not accepting the fact that they should have been all over the schedule to make sure each group had enough time to complete their tasks.\n\nThe team is never going to function without a major overhaul.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would tell management that they are the problem, not Bob.  There's always a Bob in a large enough organization.  If management does nothing to correct the situation, Bob will drive every other qualified team member away.  Bob is just being Bob.

Bob would be leaving. And the company would be apologizing. If you hadn't left the company would continue like Bob did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Ultimately, this is on the management team.

This is not on you.", "NTA. \n\nBut... \n\nLeaving people behind whenever things get hot isn't a good way to deal with such problems. Problematic people like Bob is everywhere, you will face few of them every day once you start to work. So, it's better for you to learn how to deal with them instead of cutting all ties. I am sure there are people you respect and enjoy working with in the team, for the sake of them and the effort you already put into, I think it's better to come back and start a communication about how to move forward. Hopefully without Bob. If it still doesn't work out after trying to communicate, then you will feel easier to leave them behind without worrying if you were A H.", "NTA.\n\nQuestion - is satellite club something you still enjoy? My suggestion would be to tell the Management Team you'll return if Bob leaves and all the people that left are convinced to return? Or is the electronic team toxicity because of more than Bob?", "And is Bob's apology going to be as public, vehement and drawn-out as his assholery? You and your team are NTA, and Bob needs bumped out of the club.", "NTA\n\nHere's the thing: Bob's behaviour would get him fired (unless he's a nepobaby, which sounds likely) in the real world.\n\nYou're not an ass for respecting yourself, your team, and your work enough to leave a toxic environment.", "NTA but I'll offer a little unsolicited internet advice.  What happened to you as a software engineer is normal in nearly all projects that involve prototyping.  Usually you don't have a Bob on the other end complaining at you; you get apologetic hardware engineer begging you.  But suuuuuuuppppppeeeeeerrrr common in the industry.  You might want to decide how you're going to handle those situations when you're getting paid for it if you decide to stick to most kinds of coding work.", "The management team should be firing Bob, but instead like \"good\" management they are catering to the problem and running the \"company\" into the ground.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Bob apologizing won't fix the issue, because he's refusing to be accountable.  The issue is Bob was gone and his team was not able to provide you with their portion in time for it to be tested and fixed.  That's a Bob issue - not a you issue.  Do you have a project plan with timelines?  Follow that and point out where the breakdown occurred, and who was late.  I would offer to return, but only if Bob leaves the project.", "> Just because the problem can be fixed in the software doesn't always mean the software was at fault.\n\nYes! People absolutely imagine you should be able to write perfect code that will run flawlessly without ever having access to the data it needs, or the hardware it should run on, but that is impossible. \n\nIf a colleague doesn't leave you enough time to test, then *they* have failed at *their* job.", "[removed]", "This is the insight OP needs.  *Management* has failed and is continuing to fail.  NTA and best wishes on your exams.", "Yeah, exactly.  The team didn't do as well as they wanted last year because they put together the hardware with not enough time for testing.  So this year they decided to double down and do the integration even later?\n\nHow is that not all on the management team, which should've set a schedule, and stuck to it?  Or assembled a prototype that was sufficient for software testing?\n\nThere's no shame in making mistakes (that's how you learn), but there's plenty of shame in making the same mistake as last year.  Wow.\n\n(OP is NTA, though.)", "They need new management.", "No piece of code ever works properly the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, ...... or even often the hundredth time.\n\nThe biggest component of writing good code is almost always the testing phase. If you try to generalise it before then it can take weeks to identify where the error is coming from.\n\nDirty prototypes are always the first stage of coding.", "For once the copy-bots have a personal perspective on the issue.", "Was thinking same thing, they should have had bob step down before he chased away the electronics folks. They also failed to schedule project timelines properly two years in a row.", "NTA, tell Management that because they couldn't or wouldn't keep to the schedule that caused the failure.  Further, because the HW team refused to work with your team, early testing could not be accomplished, and it is a management failure this happened.   \n    \nI would write up both issues and present them to your club advisor and let them know that you will not be returning without something fixed, you have dumped your time and energy into this, only to be blamed by the teams causing the issues.", "NTA. I did FIRST robotics in HS and still volunteer, and this is the classic competition problem that never seems to be solved. Leadership learned a valuable lesson: the time to step in and tell Bob to STFU was weeks ago, not after another failure of the other engineers to complete things on time. \n\nI do think competitions like this are incredibly valuable for learning teamwork in engineering - would you and Mike be interested in putting together conditions for returning to the team?", "Management is doing a poor job of resolving the issue, which everyone apparently recognizes is \"Bob\".  The Management Team has now had two opportunities to deal with Bob, and yet... here you are getting blamed for leaving a toxic work environment.  Clearly Bob isn't the only problem. NTA", "It sounds like the management team is utterly useless.", "Fuck that guy. NTA.", "NTA. As a fellow software developer, 1 day to test is just not enough. Bob sounds like an asshole, but also the whole team environment seems toxic. Seems like you\u2019re doing yourselves a favor not getting involved in this club anymore.", "NTA. Bob and the others are, though.", "If they are still changing the hardware specs, the software to interact with the hardware can't be even written, much less tested.", "NTA. Leave. Your efforts are not appreciated. Sounds very dysfunctional.", "At least its been great experience for real world management. \n\n\"Do nothing, blame others. That's our motto.\" -Management\n\nNTA", "NTA.  \"Management\" is trying to false equivalence/\"everyone's at fault!  Let's all apologize and hold hands and pretend this never happened instead of addressing the situation that led up to it!\"\n\nI would not go back unless (a) Bob leaves AND (b) so-called \"management\" team addresses the systemic/bureaucratic timeline failures.\n\nThe real problem here is management, letting Bob off the hook with words instead of actions and failing to support software team's efforts to avoid the mistakes of last year.  The heck is management doing if it isn't PROACTIVELY handling management problems?", ">this was a major failing of the Management team \n\nIt looks like the \"Management\" team has been completely MIA.  Now that their failure is painfully obvious they think their work is done if Bob apologizes.\n\nBut what *have* they been doing the last two years?", "Start their own satellite club called Satellite's Satellite.", "This shit is why I treat every single software person I know like they're a wizard. No, I don't understand how it works but if somebody tells me that a bunch of demons are going to happen if they don't have extra time to work on their shit I'm going to believe them."]}
