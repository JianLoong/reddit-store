What they said", "NTA good for you for standing your ground!", "NTA \n\nYour father stipulated in his will that there was to be no funeral and no wake. If the people pressuring you are planning both, they are ignoring his last wishes. That's not very respectful of them. They're doing this for themselves, not him, and you don't need to be a part of it.", "NTA if that was his wish. If your relatives want one, organise it themselves. It would be about them anyway.", "NTA.  His wishes should be followed, and your feelings regarding your relationship are valid.", "NTA", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to grieve (or not) in their own way. Your brother can have a wake for your dad if he wants, but you have no obligation to participate if you don't want to. He needs to back off.", "Nta", "My uncle is. My uncle and I agreed that even though we believe it to be in bad taste that they can have whatever ceremony they want because as another commentor said it is for the living. There will be no burial or anything like that since we followed my fathers wishes in regards to his body, but they want to do a wake/ceremony as well.", "Not even close to being an AH. Your 1 reason is enough alone without being against the wishes of your father. Your brother is actually the AH here. Yep.", "NTA. You're not preventing anyone from organizing the funeral, they just want to throw the responsibility and costs on you.", "NTA.  He's not been your father for years.  Let them carry on with the funeral.  It sounds like it's about money anyway.", "NTA dealing with something similar. My dad recently passed he was also an addict and we\u2019ve been NC for years. I haven\u2019t participated in the planning and I\u2019m not going to the service. Some people understand others are saying I should go. You have to do what feels right to you. If your brother thinks it\u2019s so important that he have a funeral than he can plan and pay for it.", "NTA. They are going against his final wishes.", "I can relate to the not having a close relationship/ being estranged from a family member.  (mine is with my mother)  I, like you, will not be part of any arrangements when it's Cindy's time. My brother and sister surely will, because they have a different relationship to her than I do.\n\nWith that said, your brother and others who loved your dad can organize the wake/funeral.  You are under no obligation help.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nat all\n\nI would sit down and word a statement and stick with it to the end of my days. Whatever words you would use. Along the lines of I'm respecting dad's final wishes. It's hard, but I can do it. Do as you please.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. The status of your relationship complicates your grief, but has no bearing in this situation. He left a will.", "NTA\n\nWhat even is a wake? What needs organising? \n\nHouse Party/Non-wake wake for dad. BYO drinks, dish for a pot luck, and favourite story about dad. \n\n$150 maybe to fill the gas bottle, get some ice, chips, and other essentials. Surely your brother can handle that", "NTA", "NTA.  He's gone, you don't anyone any explanations for your actions.", "NTA. As you said. You didn't have a relationship. Plus he didn't want one. As my mother says, funerals are for the living.", "NTA. Putting aside a tricky relationship, quite simply the man himself said no wake/funeral. What\u2019s so hard to understand about that?!", " Your 1 reason is enough alone without being against the wishes of your father.", "The irony that the only person respecting your father's wishes is you who didn't want anything to do with him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nBoth for the grief he caused you in life and for the fact that it is in direct opposition to his own final wishes.", "NTA. Everybody grieves differently.", "NTA\n\nYou're respecting your father's wishes not to have a funeral or wake.", "NTA\n\nIf they want a funeral so bad, then let them organize one. You have nothing to do with the man anymore, don\u2019t waste anymore time than you already have on him", "NTA - they can have a gathering to honor your father - and you don't have to attend.", "NTA", "op=NTA\n\nIf your brother thinks it's important then he can arrange it.  \n\nNot your monkey, not your circus.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet them sort it out if they want one. You don't have to give a reason.", "NTA.  Not your circus, not your monkeys.", "I disagree in parts.\n\nYes... the dead don't, and can't, care what it's done with them after they're dead.\n\nBut this is a breach of societal rules. As in... most people don't worry about in life what's happens after they die, because they have wills, and know their wishes will be carried out.\n\n\nNow image if this wasn't the case, that it was uncertain what would happen after a person died. They didn't know and couldn't control where they were buried, if their organs are donated, if and what religious ceremony they'll have, etc... etc... etc. Now they'll live in anxiety about those thing.\n\nAnd that impact their lives tremendously. That's why any breach of this protocol is unacceptable in my eyes. Because it causes real harm to the living.", "Your father was an alcoholic so now that he's dead, some people want to get drunk in his honor. Smh.", "It said addict...not alchohalic...but your probably correct with the irony anyway"]}
