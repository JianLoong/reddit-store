They didn't know and couldn't control where they were buried, if their organs are donated, if and what religious ceremony they'll have, etc... etc... etc. Now they'll live in anxiety about those thing.\n\nAnd that impact their lives tremendously.

What was his relationship like with your father?", "NTA", "I really hate it when people post here about how they are under pressure to violate someone\u2019s last wishes. Usually it\u2019s about how the will has distributed the money. People who were left nothing will come out of the woodwork and claim that they deserve part of the estate anyhow. In almost all cases, it\u2019s a relative who gave the dying family member little or no attention at the end. Now friends and family are leaning on OP to stage a wake or funeral in spite of the fact that it was specifically indicated by the decedent not to! \n\nThis is reprehensible. A will is not a list of suggestions. It reflects the deepest feelings of the deceased. We would all want our last wishes to be respected. Last wishes are supposed to be binding. Instead, people have this \u201cyes, but . . . \u201c attitude. Then they do whatever they feel like, never thinking that they are setting a dangerous precedent.

Let them hold a wake/memorial on their own.", "Yes, but...\nWhen it comes to your estate, i.e your property, assets and money you leave behind then sure, your will is a legally binding document.\nWhen it comes to your mortal remains, how they are disposed of and what memorials, gatherings etc might be held, there is absolutely no way to legally prevent your family/friends etc doing whatever the hell they want, no matter what preferences they may express. Although I think if you sign up to donate your body to science your family can't override that, could be wrong.", "This is an excellent example of rule utilitarianism, an ethical approach that I use myself. Nice.", "But you can't control that. Your will isn't legally binding when it comes to your mortal remains.", "That's why it's a social contract.\n\nI do to you what you want... and in return, I can live in peace expecting people will do to me what I want.\n\nIf we start disregarding people's whishes, the system colapses.

It can help with the grieving process. If you don't want to be a part, that's fine too. My sister and I are both NC with one parent. We'd only go to the funeral to make sure they were dead.", "My father told us that he didn\u2019t want a wake or funeral.  He died in an accident a few months after mentioning that, but we all felt like we needed to get together with friends and family so we had a memorial service.   We were able to follow his wishes and have a way for everyone to come together.  I know he would have loved it.", "NTA - but your brothers need help processing and grieving, be helpful. Oftentimes people who survive addicts sit with regret and sorrow and they wonder \"what if I did...\" or \"could I have tried...\" and they experience a lot of guilt.", "NTA point out to your brother that you're following your father's last wish , not your brother's wants.", "NTA. Tell him you are just abiding by your father's final wishes and will not be attending regardless of what your brother or your father's friends think. If they want a wake or funeral, it is up to them to plan and pay for it. You will not.", "NTA", "My brother wanted to be cremated and have his ashes scattered at a place that he would go fishing or just sit and think. My mother was against this. She insisted that he be buried at the cemetery where her and my father would eventually be buried. Since my younger brother was the one picking up the ashes, he took the majority of our brother's ashes and scattered them where my brother wanted to be scattered. If my mother had ever found out, she would probably have had a heart attack. Several years after she disregarded what he wanted done with his ashes her brother died. He was a submariner in WWII and stayed in the Navy until his retirement. His wishes were to have his ashes scattered at sea by the Navy. When his widow refused his request and had his ashes buried, my mother ranted about her SIL not respecting her brother's final wishes. She could not even see the hypocrisy of that considering she refused her son's final wishes.", "My mother did something similar. My grandmother believed it was the proper Christian thing to be buried (she was born in 1890 and raised Methodist.) Out of sheer spite, my mother had her cremated. My mother has a long rap sheet of bad behavior, but I really especially hated it that she disrespected my grandma\u2019s wishes like that.", "NTA\n\nFeels incredibly disrespectful to have a wake when he explicitly said he did not want one. \n\nWhen my great grandfather died. His eldest son, who had been absent from his father's life, but who showed up because he smelled money; took over the whole funeral planning and it was just a whole performative bunch of lies where he made it sound like they were so close. He also made it out to be that my my adamantly atheist great grandfather was the most religious guy ever. The whole thing was so disrespectful. Both to the living and the dead.\n\nSome people treat funerals like opportunities to rewrite history to suit themselves. \n\nIt's better to be honest. If not in death. When.", "NTA.

Completely right, not OP's problem.", "NTA", "My father decided he wanted to have my mother cremated and asked all of us for our permission. He said she had stated she didn\u2019t want to be in the ground and I told him that\u2019s exactly how I feel. About a year after she died, he went to the funeral home and planned and paid for his own funeral so we wouldn\u2019t be burdened with making that decision. More people should be like him.", "NTA, if your father was more of a burden than a boon to you then he doesn't deserve your effort. The fact that he didn't want a big event only adds you being courteous to his wishes.", "[removed]", "Comment stolen from u/Cannabis-aficionado \n\nu/environmentalrub1300 is a bot", "People gathering to remember someone is very different than what\u2019s done with mortal remains and earthly possessions. It\u2019s certainly right to let someone have a say on whether they\u2019re buried or cremated, etc. To a lesser but still valid extent, giving the deceased a say in what religious ceremonies are performed is appropriate.  \n\nBut a wake or memorial is essentially a bunch of people in a room remembering someone. No one has the right to say, \u201cwhen I die, I don\u2019t want anyone to talk about me in groups of three or more people. One-on-one conversations only, and only when necessary.\u201d My memories of my mom, say, do not belong to my mom. They are mine, and if I want to share them with other people who also remember her, that\u2019s my absolute right. If being in a room full of people who are also sad about her death gives me comfort, I\u2019m not going to avoid that room. Her wishes don\u2019t enter into it.", "Some people don\u2019t want anything and that\u2019s their right.", "It\u2019s unreasonable??\n\nWe had no service for my mother for the same reasons as OP - she was horrid and she didn\u2019t want one.", "Come on... you're being purposefully obtuse here.\n\nIf a person says \"No funeral and wake when I die.\" is pretty clear what they are talking about it.\n\nThey are not forbidding anyone from talking about them in groups of 3 or more.\n\nWhat they don't want is for people to gather to cremate and/or burry them, them after get together to celebrate their life and memories.\n\nIs it this hard for you to respect the wishes of the person you are pretending to care. Because if you did care, you wouldn't do a funeral and wake, against their wishes.", "Well, his body was disposed of as he wished with no funeral followed by a wake. If his buddies want to have an unofficial get together of their own, to swap memories et cetera, it would be unreasonable to forbid it. They\u2019re adults, if they want to meet to drink and remember their old pal, who\u2019s to stop them?", "Could it have been a money issue?  Cremations are less expensive.", "It\u2019s the \u201cget together to celebrate their life and memories\u201d that I don\u2019t think the deceased should have any say in. What\u2019s done with their body? Yes. What\u2019s done with their immortal soul (I don\u2019t believe in those, but respect that some do) in terms of religious services? Sure. \n\n  But they can\u2019t control other people, and if it makes the living people feel better to get together and talk about the deceased, as one does at a wake or memorial, I think that\u2019s the living people\u2019s right. And I think the deceased trying to control what people do in terms of memorials and/or wakes is actually pretty similar to trying to say \u201cdon\u2019t gather in groups of two or more.\u201d", "This daughter certainly isn't stopping them!  They can organize whatever they want.  It is just that they, and the brother, want HER to organize it, which she is not going to do.", "No. She hated her.", "Not should she.
