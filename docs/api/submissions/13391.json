They are not free to conscript you.", "NTA. \nWhy would they ignore his wishes? That\u2019s awful", "Anyone who insists on having a wake and funeral services when this is directly contrary to the deceased's wishes is TA.", "NTA, you aren\u2019t obligated to do anything you aren\u2019t comfortable or willing to do.

It\u2019s kind of a dick move on your family\u2019s part to straight up ignore your father\u2019s wishes on this front, but again, the funeral isn\u2019t for him.\n\nETA: third sentence", "NTA If your father didn't want a wake or funeral then there shouldn't be one.

My uncle and I agreed that even though we believe it to be in bad taste that they can have whatever ceremony they want because as another commentor said it is for the living.
