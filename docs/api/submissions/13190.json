It is like a food court: there are 7 different tiny kitchens that all serve different dishes everyone can choose from. The place is almost always packed and they do not do reservations. \n\nMy fiancee and I sat at the end of a longer table meant to sit multiple parties. Another family of 4 people was sitting at the table already, there was some space between them and us. After 40 minutes the other family left. A bigger family of 7 people came in and saw the freed up space as an opportunity. It would be difficult for them to find seating, so we got that. They sat next to us and left no space. The mom of the family sat next to my fiancee. \n\nThe two kids next to me started playfighting and bumping into me. My fiancee saw that I was uncomfortable so she asked me to sit next to her. I did, the space was small but I do not mind sitting close to my fiancee ofc.  The mom noticed and asked my fiancee if we wanted to sit somewhere else. My fiancee said no, as we were already sitting here, and that everything was fine. The mom explained that we could move because were bothered by them, my fiancee replied that the situation was okay now that I had moved and we were not bothered by them at all. \n\nA couple minutes later another bigger table opens up and the family gets up to move. My fiancee wanted to make sure they knew that they did not have to move because of us. At that point the mom said: it would have been better if you two had just moved like I asked. My fiancee replied that we were already sitting here when they came in. The mom said: yes but we cannot go elsewhere so it would have been better if you had just moved instead. \n\nWe were kind of stunned, it felt like she thinks we were assholes. We thought it was weird of them to ask us (the people already at the table) to move elsewhere. We could have moved though.
