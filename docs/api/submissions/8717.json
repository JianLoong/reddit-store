She and her BF, the baby's father, have hit a rough patch and Ann came to stay with us.  She's been living with us for about 6 weeks now.  Her job allows her to work from home, so she pretty much spends all of her time at our house.  Both my wife and I work outside of the home, so Ann is at home by herself a lot.  For the most part, she's a good houseguest.  She's not overly messy and is mostly pleasant to be around.  \n\nBut, pregnancy is weird.  I understand hormones are a thing.  Ann will have mood swings and gets emotional really easily.  She also gets cravings, which for some reason have fallen on me to solve.  My wife has sent me out of the house at all hours of the day to get something for Ann, or send me on errands after work to pick up something specifically for Ann.  When I protest to my wife, she says that Ann is going through an incredibly hard time and we need to be supportive of her.  \n\nI kind of blew up at my wife when she sent me out to get Ann some fast food at 1am this past Saturday.  I told my wife she should go, but she said she had to get up early for an appointment the next day.  I ended up going, but told my wife that I'm done with this because I'm not an errand boy nor am I the father of Ann's kid.  \n\nThe next day it was just Ann and I at our house while my wife was out runnning errands.  I made myself a sandwich for lunch and when Ann saw it, she said it looked really good and asked if I could make one for her too.  I told her the ingredients were still on the counter so she can make one herself.  She said she was feeling lightheaded and needed to sit down, but that some food would help her.  \n\nI tried to tell her no, but she started getting emotional and saying how hard pregnancy is when you don't have a partner.  I said \"fine\" and went to make her a sandwich.  But then, she told me that I will have to heat the lunchmeat up because her doctor told her not to have lunchmeat unless it's heated up first.  \n\nAt that point, I told her that I'm not her baby's daddy, nor am I her servant.  I told her I've tried to be supportive and helpful, but that I'm done playing the role of her partner.  I told her that, out of courtesy, I've given her privacy regarding her relationship issues, but that she's going to need to figure out a plan soon because this current situation isn't working for me anymore.  \n\nAnn started crying and I ended up leaving to give myself a chance to cool down.  When I got home, my wife was pretty much waiting for me and immediately laid into me.  She told me I was a huge asshole for not just making Ann a sandwich, and an even bigger asshole for pretty much threatening to kick her out.  She said that I should have known better than to bring up her relationship and that it was a huge jerk move.\n\nMy wife has always said that this would be temporary while Ann figures her stuff out, but the further Ann's pregnancy goes, the less progress I see towards a solution.", "created_utc": 1675107529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pbtc5/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_sil_a_sandwich_when/", "score": 1362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sit her down and tell her that you are no longer willing to be at your SIL's beck and call (or hers for SIL related tasks) and that there needs to be an agreed upon end date for your SIL living with you. Your SIL is an adult with a job. It is not unreasonable to expect her to be working on a plan that does not include living with you long term. \n\nIf your wife is not willing to accept your boundaries in this situation then there are larger problems in your marriage than your SIL.", "NTA.

In month 7 was carrying crates of ketchup up the stairs. No, I don't think every woman should have to do this, BUT this idea that because you are pregnant, you are somehow incapable of self-care is a bunch of manipulative bs.  If you have a real medical reason, of course, understandable. Other than that, no reason not to be able to do all the things in life that must be done such as fixing your damn sandwich.  Not to mention that she should be making all these trips alone because it will be the last time she can do so without having to take a half hour just to pack the car.", "NTA\n\nYeah the sandwich isn't an issue.  What's the plan forward?  Before long, there's going to be a baby.  Then you're gonna be waking up at all hours to the crying and stuff. \n\nThen it'll be a toddler.  Stepping on toys.\n\nWhat's the path out of this?  Hopes and dreams of her relationship mending?  The boyfriend coming to visit his child at your house, making both of them sandwiches?  One with the crust cut off for the toddlers?", "NTA. If the tables were turned and the wife was pressured to take care of her BIL, this would be a blood fest. Continue sticking up for yourself.

All of this is just a glimpse into the future.", "Why does pregnant without a partner mean entitled and helpless???", "Ann has a job.

You may also need to be clear with your wife that you are not willing to give up your home life indefinitely, and that there NEEDS to be an actionable plan in place to regain SIL's independence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From the way the post goes, Ann asked OP's wife to get food at 1 AM and OP's wife offloaded that task on OP and somehow Ann is getting blamed for that when in reality the blame lies on OP's wife for insisting that Ann is catered to while refusing to do the catering herself. \n\nWe also don't know what the situation is that resulted in her current falling out with her partner. For all we know there could have been something seriously wrong happening behind closed doors there that necessitated her to leave. It's very easy for us to puff out our chests and claim this is such an easy and obvious solution for her to just go back to her partner and make him do all the heavy lifting when we don't know what happened in the first place. \n\nThe bottom line is, it is not Ann's fault that OP's wife keeps putting OP in an difficult position by constantly pressuring him to go out of his way to an uncomfortable degree. That does not mean Ann is manipulating the entire situation in order to make him into a surrogate father, replacement husband, and servant. That means OP's wife made a unilateral agreement without OP's permission and now offloads the actual labor on OP because she's too lazy to accommodate to the extent she insists should happen to begin with. All of this could have been circumvented had OP just spoken to Ann during a free moment in a calm manner to tell her it's taking up too much of his time and energy to accommodate her and that they need to come up with a different strategy instead of going nuclear on her as if she intentionally masterminded this whole miserable spectacle. He describes her as a clean and pleasant person, which doesn't give me the impression that she would have freaked out screaming at him if she were made aware there's an actual issue. That is why ESH, not just Ann.", "It says nowhere that Ann came to OP directly with this request and insisted that OP be the one to do it. Ann asked OP's wife, her sister, to do this. OP's wife, when it was just her and OP, offloaded a favor she agreed to on OP with pressuring and guilting. The fact that the frustration and resentment over doing this favor comes back around to Ann when she wasn't the one who demanded that he specifically do this when he didn't agree to do this is wrong.\n\nIf she's being told by her sister constantly things like \"if you need anything just ask we're here for you 100%\" and NEVER hearing anything to the contrary from OP, then it's unreasonable to claim that she's totally completely aware that OP is not actually on board with this dynamic to begin with.\n\nShe didn't cry to her sister about OP not making her a sandwich. She cried to her sister because OP, seemingly out of nowhere in Ann's perspective, snapped at her going \"You're trying to turn me into your husband, baby daddy, and servant and you need to leave.\" And that is a terrifying thing to have thrown at you when you're unaware there's been an ongoing frustration with you asking for favors with food accommodations.\n\nSo desperate to put 100% blame on Ann like they're seemingly masterminding this whole ordeal when in reality OP's wife keeps agreeing to degrees of accommodation she's too lazy to follow through with and guilts OP into picking up the slack. It's only natural from Ann's perspective, who has not been told directly even once prior to OP going nuclear that there's an issue here, to be under the impression there wasn't actually an issue to ask OP directly to make her a sandwich when he just made himself one.\n\nAnn is not at fault for her sister's behavior behind closed doors. Even if I personally feel that Ann is asking too much, the fact still remains that nobody told her directly and she's likely being told the exact opposite by OP's wife who refuses to do the actual labor she's agreeing to herself. OP keeps laying the blame on Ann for his wife's behavior and unloaded that in a terrible fashion on her rather than putting his foot down with his own wife and or having a reasonable discussion with Ann about his own boundaries in this situation.  That is why ESH.\n\nAnd I stand by that if he truly believes he's being forced and manipulated into being a husband, father, servant all wrapped up in one because he's being pressured to go out and get food at odd hours by his wife because she's too lazy to uphold her own agreements then he needs to follow through with what he said to Ann and kick her out.

Her son got up early and decided to have some. How, you ask? By taking a pencil and stabbing a hole in the bottom of the carton and drinking from that. He couldn't stop it after he'd had his fill, though, and I woke up to almost 4ltrs of chocolate milk all over the floor. Which I cried over.

Hormones, behavior, etc. Sure, there are compromised pregnancies where people need more help because of medical issues, but this is just SIL being unable/unwilling to deal with her relationship stuff, staying with her big sis who'll baby her, and not really caring that her BIL has no interest in being a father/father figure and yet somehow thinking he should just be okay catering to a grown person with two feet and a heartbeat who wants food at 1am and sandwiches they can make themselves.

You absolutely have the right to refuse to cater to your SIL, as well as have an end date for her staying in your house.", "Nta. Have her hands stopped working due to her pregnancy? I've had kids and never have I asked someone else to cook for me or sent my husband to get food at night.\nPeople try to excuse bad behaviour due to pregnancy.", "Soft yta, but you were right about her finding a better long term solution. It should have been a conversation you had with your wife though.", "NTA your not her personal maid or server, I'm currently almost 7 months pregnant and I'd never pull that shit, sure you get light headed sometimes and have cravings, I too ask my partner/FATHER of my child(soon to be children) to make me something I'm craving but I'd never cry because he said no. Id just make it myself instead. Sounds like she is just playing on the fact she's pregnant to be lazy tbh. Food does not make your light-headed feeling go away, laying down or resting does.", "babe go on, have a vacation. you need space. NTA", "NTA sister being too much and you are right she is capable and able to do things while pregnant as I am and always have when I\u2019m pregnant . The issue is the sister sees vulnerability in Ann and that not how she needs to approach this especially if this is temporary situation she needs to help her at best and give her resources and provide guidance. She has a job so she must be saving for a place", "You seem to have forgotten to write the part where you blew up? You're completely right, your wife wants to \"loan\" you to her sister since she's having relationship issues. Your wife is a hypocrite for insisting her sister is treated like a princess and then delegating all of the heavy lifting to you.\n\nSIL sounds manipulative, and your wife defends her like a hound when you stand up for yourself. The issue here is your wife - make her do everything now. Once your wife starts to do her sister's chores, she will want her gone asap.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Sounds like the women in your life are treating you terribly. I hope for your sake you can salvage this relationship but your wife is putting her sister ahead of you priority-wise. You married her, not her and her pregnant sister. My own experience with the women I have the great misfortune of being related to banding together against myself and my brothers is a big part of why I have an extremely difficult time trusting people. It was really hard for me to accept that they would always treat me like garbage no matter what I did because they hated me for daring to be male.\n\nStay strong my guy, you need to have some frank discussions with your wife snoopy boundaries and stop giving in to her when you calm down. You were angry for a reason, remember that... Letting her off the hook showed her that she can get whatever she wants and I strongly suspect this is just the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nNTA", "YTA ESH", "This exactly. She\u2019s 5 months pregnant, not ill. She\u2019s being ridiculous and entitled", "I agree she can make her own sandwich. Or at least quickly eat something like a piece of fruit if she's feeling lightheaded. I went through two pregnancies by myself. Cravings suck but, you just eat what's in the house.\n\nI don't know where you live that it's safe for a pregnant woman to be out by herself at 1 am. Too many shootings and drive-by's to do that where I live. Nobody should be out around here that late unless you absolutely have to be.  She's being pretty entitled to ask op to risk his life for food.", "NTA - Ann is getting WAY TOO COMFORTABLE", "Exactly. If OP's wife starts catering to her sister's demands, she'll want her sister gone tomorrow.", ">She's pregnant, not sick. Make her own damn sandwich.\n\nEveryone always underestimates the severe trauma that's involved with sandwich making. Don't even get me started on the microwave.", "I had no idea that a woman who is 5 month s pregnant can\u2019t go to the store for herself or make her own sandwich.  NTA.", "It's making boundaries and forcing the wife to actually help her sister, instead of bullying OP into it. \n\nMy wife has two sisters who visited while pregnant. Pulled the same shit (short stays though). I laughed the first time when they expected me to get them shit in the middle of the night. Told them fuck no. The second time I told them and my wife in no uncertain terms they could go get their own shit. \n\nIt takes a lot to piss me off, but my wife knew this was something that did. Didn't press it again and the few times her sisters were inconsolable about wanting what they wanted and needing it right then, she got whatever or ordered it. \n\nAs soon as OP's wife starts taking the load instead of delegating it, she'll either try and force OP to do it, or get sick of it and tell her sister to pull her head in.", "And at five months.", "She\u2019s barely even showing at five months", "Nta ,tell your wife as of now She alone is responsible  for her sister needs /cravings  you are helping  enough by letting her stay. I also agree with the comments  to set a fix3d date for sil to move out asap and before the 7 /7,5 months  or you will live with the baby.", "Yeah... that baby is going to grow up in your house.", "Wife is telling SIL that everything is fine, that she's allowed to ask, and that they're both willing to support her. OP does not feel the same but never states that directly to SIL until he blows up from frustration and resentment with claims that he's being forced into being a father, husband, servant and that she needs to leave. OP's wife disrespects OP by refusing to acknowledge that he doesn't actually want to do these things nor does he feel obligated. She guilts and pressures him into doing these things. Ann is unaware of this facet of the dynamic because she's not a part of their exchanges as a couple behind closed doors. \n\nAnn is entitled with how much accommodation she desires, but that doesn't change the fact that nobody communicated to her that there was an issue until OP went nuclear. The fault lies with OP's wife and ended up with OP swinging low at the wrong person for this situation getting so out of hand.", "Some women have difficult pregnancies and do have to be pretty much on bed rest from about that time on, but I didn\u2019t see him mention anything about that. Pregnancy does take a toll on the body and being irritable, hormonal or fatigued I think is pretty normal. What is not normal is expecting people who have already done you a huge favour by taking you in to cater to your every whim. OP is NTA. Being sent out at 1am to satisfy a craving is insane.", "It's likely that her way of delegating/dealing is handing it off to her husband, which I think says a lot about her mentality as a wife and partner. This would be a pain in the butt enough if she was the one who was pregnant and expecting her husband to do all this for her, but the fact that it's her sister who's freeloading just adds another fuck no element to it. Sister needs to learn to do for herself, tbh. And wife needs to figure out that her husband has zero to do with this. There are two parents involved in this soon to be child and sister needs to figure out her relationship stuff and not boohoo her way into passing it off onto wife who then shucks it off to OP. I hope he stands by not doing diddly and wife really needs a reality check, because this is potentially relationship ending behavior.", "Why? The wife hasn\u2019t listened to OP so far. He wanted more information why Ann was moving in and the wife told OP is wasn\u2019t any of his business and refused to even mention how long Ann would stay. Now this? OPs wife has -500 respect for them. Get out now", ">I mean, I\u2019m not about to pull a typical Reddit move and recommend that he race for divorce immediately.\n\nBut it would *definitely* solve the problem!", "Sad because most of them can\u2019t find a spouse in the first place\u2026", "Who knows how privy she is to their conversations I\u2019d expect she\u2019s quite aware since she\u2019s been living there for 6 weeks and her sister has a history of babying her so now doubt bitches about op behind his back", "Completely agree with this OP, best thing to do", "Better call Saul.", "If not now, when? When she's 8 months pregnant?\n\nWhen the baby is born? When the kid is 2 years old? 5 years old?\n\nIt's not going to get any easier the more you wait.\n\n>I haven't said anything like that to my wife yet because that sounds like a relationship-killing\n\nMay be consult with a divorce lawyer before you do anything. \n\nGet all your ducks lined up.", "> Maybe a stint in a woman's shelter will teach her the valuable lesson to never ask for help with food again.\n\nThis line really proves you're not discussing in good faith. The fact you are trying to paint this as a fight about asking for food shows that don't have any argument. That's not what the argument was about and you know it. For some reason, you just want to paint OP in a bad light even though you don't have a leg to stand on.", "This is excellent advice :-)", "Everybody in this story deserves to be painted in a bad light. You seem upset with me because I won't treat OP like a total innocent. Not a single one of them is able to have a reasonable conversation to get on the same page about how this living situation is going to work out and how long it's going to last. A situation that is clearly spearheaded by OP's wife rather than Ann who was never once told that there was an issue but rather that she was allowed to ask for these things and that they (according to OP's wife) would oblige. He doesn't actually deserve to be treated as an innocent in this situation when he didn't have it in him to speak directly to SIL once about his issues and instead festered in his resentment until it turned into \"I'm being forced into being a husband, father, and servant and I want you out.\" This misdirected blame resulted in frightening an already vulnerable person experiencing instability with a sudden indication that they're about to face a whole bigger heap of instability. It's easy for you and I to say she should just go back to her actual baby daddy but we don't know why she left in the first place. For all we know it could have been a situation of abuse.", "OP's words were \"she's going to need to figure out a plan soon because this current situation isn't working for me anymore.\" You are mad at OP for not \"speaking directly\" to Ann about his issue, but when he does, you're mad at OP for \"frightening\" Ann. Your position is frankly preposterous.", "If it started and stopped at the sandwich it'd be no big deal. As a one off, sure making a sandwich isn't a big deal, but the things that are asked of him go way beyond what he should feel obliged to do. Hell, I'd even say what he's done for her is wayy more than a massage.", "Telling somebody over being asked to heat up some lunch meat that you're being forced into being a baby daddy, husband, servant and that they need to leave is not speaking directly about this issue. He does not explain what the actual issue is. He does not explain how long this issue has been going on. He does not explain that his wife wanting to step up doesn't extend to him by default. He does not explain when and how it's appropriate for her to ask for a favor and when it isn't. He doesn't tell her exactly why he feels like he's being ushered into all 3 of these roles over being asked to handle food related favors by mainly his wife for Ann. That is a frightening way to express she's gone way too far after 6 weeks of saying nothing to the person you believe the issue lies with. Especially when she's been hearing a completely different narrative from OP's wife.\n\nIf you think that's mature and direct communication then we're never going to agree on anything. I don't think you're right to say that this was totally justified behavior directed at the correct person. You don't think I'm right to say that nobody was behaving well in this matter and that this was an inappropriate and nonconstructive result of misdirected blame and a lack of communication. You want to lay all of the blame solely on Ann in this situation, when I believe the blame starts with OP's wife and ends on all 3 of them. We can keep going in circles but obviously neither of us are going to budge.", "I know, he shouldn't have to leave. I don't want him to go through that at all. This is a shit situation where OP is being shat on pretty badly. \n\nBut him kicking out SIL is going to give the wife an excuse to blame him for everything: as we can all see she is not of sound judgement right now. . \n\nIf OP says 'Hey, I'm not ok with this. I'm out until this shit show is sorted.\" and puts the onus of the relationship on his wife.\n\nThis really is a situation where the wife needs to decide her priorities. Short of manhandling a pregnant woman, I don't think SIL is going to leave while her sister says she can stay.\n\nLook, I hope OP and wife can sort this out. I don't want to jump on the divorce bandwagon, but it's a real possibility here. This has the added benefit of giving OP a break, which it sounds like he needs.", ">You want to lay all of the blame solely on Ann in this situation, when I believe the blame starts with OP's wife\n\nIn no way did I say the wife is blameless in this situation and I have no idea where you got that from. \n\nI think you need to stop victim blaming OP because he didn't figure out the perfect words to defend himself as he was being taken advantage of.", "It's incredible how desperate y'all are to put 0 blame on OP's wife here despite her obviously spearheading this situation. Especially when my original comment started off with pointing out that SIL is being entitled, but that all flies out the window because I won't treat OP like an innocent in this situation for misdirecting his blame onto the wrong person and blowing up. \n\n>**My wife** has sent me out of the house at all hours of the day to get something for Ann, or send me on errands after work to pick up something specifically for Ann.\n\nSo Ann is not directly asking OP, Ann is asking OP's wife and she then proceeds to offload the labor onto an unwilling party. \n\n>When I protest to **my wife,** **she** says that Ann is going through an incredibly hard time and **we need to be supportive** of her.\n\nSo obviously she's not the one feeling guilted here, she is the one guilting OP here. OP does not protest directly to Ann. He is protesting directly to the person coming to him to offload labor that they agreed to do that he didn't personally agree to do. \n\n>I kind of blew up at **my wife** when **she** sent me out to get Ann some fast food at 1am\n\nAgain, Ann isn't coming to OP directly with these requests. \n\n>I told **my wife** she should go, but she said she had to get up early\n\nOffloading the labor onto an unwilling participant with guilting and pressuring because she's too lazy to follow through on something she personally agreed to do. \n\n>**my wife** was pretty much waiting for me and immediately laid into me. **She** told me I was a huge asshole for not just making Ann a sandwich,\n\nAgain, wife is guilting OP. Ann did also guilt OP prior to this, but look at who is actually spearheading the situation instead of telling her precious little sister \"No sometimes we can't go out of our way to make or get you food. You shouldn't have pressured him. He went too far with what he said but you also need to apologize.\" Instead she tries to guilt OP. \n\n>**My wife** has always said that this would be temporary\n\nAgain, spearheaded by the wife. Refuses to get everyone on the same page.\n\nAnd from OP's own comment:\n\n>**She's** very protective of Ann, always has been.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**My wife** won't tell me specifics about the issues Ann is having with her baby's daddy and told me I need to respect Ann's privacy\n\nAgain, spearheaded by the wife playing cups on strings with two people here. Instead of allowing everyone to come together to get on the same page, she insists on being a pseudo-mediator that pressures OP to fall in line rather than establishing a dynamic that also works for him. Op's wife has decided it's fine to keep him completely in the dark about the true extent of this situation either because she left for no good reason or because something truly dark was happening behind closed doors. Regardless, she set OP up for failure by pressuring him to fall in line with her wishes to cater to her little sister without positing any good reason as to why this situation should continue indefinitely. \n\n>**my wife** is very much in protective mode right now.\n\nAt OP's expense. \n\n>**She'**s been taking time off work to go with Ann to all of her appointments and has bought Ann some specialty pregnancy items\n\nHow did he tell her the truth that he's being forced to be a husband and baby daddy here when he's not the one doing these things for her?\n\n>It does seem like making sure Ann is cared for is **my wife's #1 priority** right now.\n\nBeing guilted and manipulated my ass. It's more immature to play absolutes than it is to point out that literally all of them are AHs for this situation getting so out of hand."]}
