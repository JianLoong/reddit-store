She and her BF, the baby's father, have hit a rough patch and Ann came to stay with us.  She's been living with us for about 6 weeks now.  Her job allows her to work from home, so she pretty much spends all of her time at our house.  Both my wife and I work outside of the home, so Ann is at home by herself a lot.  For the most part, she's a good houseguest.  She's not overly messy and is mostly pleasant to be around.  \n\nBut, pregnancy is weird.  I understand hormones are a thing.  Ann will have mood swings and gets emotional really easily.  She also gets cravings, which for some reason have fallen on me to solve.  My wife has sent me out of the house at all hours of the day to get something for Ann, or send me on errands after work to pick up something specifically for Ann.  When I protest to my wife, she says that Ann is going through an incredibly hard time and we need to be supportive of her.  \n\nI kind of blew up at my wife when she sent me out to get Ann some fast food at 1am this past Saturday.  I told my wife she should go, but she said she had to get up early for an appointment the next day.  I ended up going, but told my wife that I'm done with this because I'm not an errand boy nor am I the father of Ann's kid.  \n\nThe next day it was just Ann and I at our house while my wife was out runnning errands.  I made myself a sandwich for lunch and when Ann saw it, she said it looked really good and asked if I could make one for her too.  I told her the ingredients were still on the counter so she can make one herself.  She said she was feeling lightheaded and needed to sit down, but that some food would help her.  \n\nI tried to tell her no, but she started getting emotional and saying how hard pregnancy is when you don't have a partner.  I said \"fine\" and went to make her a sandwich.  But then, she told me that I will have to heat the lunchmeat up because her doctor told her not to have lunchmeat unless it's heated up first.  \n\nAt that point, I told her that I'm not her baby's daddy, nor am I her servant.  I told her I've tried to be supportive and helpful, but that I'm done playing the role of her partner.  I told her that, out of courtesy, I've given her privacy regarding her relationship issues, but that she's going to need to figure out a plan soon because this current situation isn't working for me anymore.  \n\nAnn started crying and I ended up leaving to give myself a chance to cool down.  When I got home, my wife was pretty much waiting for me and immediately laid into me.  She told me I was a huge asshole for not just making Ann a sandwich, and an even bigger asshole for pretty much threatening to kick her out.  She said that I should have known better than to bring up her relationship and that it was a huge jerk move.\n\nMy wife has always said that this would be temporary while Ann figures her stuff out, but the further Ann's pregnancy goes, the less progress I see towards a solution.", "created_utc": 1675107529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pbtc5/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_sil_a_sandwich_when/", "score": 451, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sit her down and tell her that you are no longer willing to be at your SIL's beck and call (or hers for SIL related tasks) and that there needs to be an agreed upon end date for your SIL living with you. Your SIL is an adult with a job. It is not unreasonable to expect her to be working on a plan that does not include living with you long term. \n\nIf your wife is not willing to accept your boundaries in this situation then there are larger problems in your marriage than your SIL.", "NTA.

In month 7 was carrying crates of ketchup up the stairs. No, I don't think every woman should have to do this, BUT this idea that because you are pregnant, you are somehow incapable of self-care is a bunch of manipulative bs.  If you have a real medical reason, of course, understandable. Other than that, no reason not to be able to do all the things in life that must be done such as fixing your damn sandwich.  Not to mention that she should be making all these trips alone because it will be the last time she can do so without having to take a half hour just to pack the car.", "NTA\n\nYeah the sandwich isn't an issue.  What's the plan forward?  Before long, there's going to be a baby.  Then you're gonna be waking up at all hours to the crying and stuff. \n\nThen it'll be a toddler.  Stepping on toys.\n\nWhat's the path out of this?  Hopes and dreams of her relationship mending?  The boyfriend coming to visit his child at your house, making both of them sandwiches?  One with the crust cut off for the toddlers?", "NTA. If the tables were turned and the wife was pressured to take care of her BIL, this would be a blood fest. Continue sticking up for yourself.

All of this is just a glimpse into the future.", "Why does pregnant without a partner mean entitled and helpless???", "Ann has a job.

You may also need to be clear with your wife that you are not willing to give up your home life indefinitely, and that there NEEDS to be an actionable plan in place to regain SIL's independence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From the way the post goes, Ann asked OP's wife to get food at 1 AM and OP's wife offloaded that task on OP and somehow Ann is getting blamed for that when in reality the blame lies on OP's wife for insisting that Ann is catered to while refusing to do the catering herself. \n\nWe also don't know what the situation is that resulted in her current falling out with her partner. For all we know there could have been something seriously wrong happening behind closed doors there that necessitated her to leave. It's very easy for us to puff out our chests and claim this is such an easy and obvious solution for her to just go back to her partner and make him do all the heavy lifting when we don't know what happened in the first place. \n\nThe bottom line is, it is not Ann's fault that OP's wife keeps putting OP in an difficult position by constantly pressuring him to go out of his way to an uncomfortable degree. That does not mean Ann is manipulating the entire situation in order to make him into a surrogate father, replacement husband, and servant. That means OP's wife made a unilateral agreement without OP's permission and now offloads the actual labor on OP because she's too lazy to accommodate to the extent she insists should happen to begin with. All of this could have been circumvented had OP just spoken to Ann during a free moment in a calm manner to tell her it's taking up too much of his time and energy to accommodate her and that they need to come up with a different strategy instead of going nuclear on her as if she intentionally masterminded this whole miserable spectacle. He describes her as a clean and pleasant person, which doesn't give me the impression that she would have freaked out screaming at him if she were made aware there's an actual issue. That is why ESH, not just Ann.", "It says nowhere that Ann came to OP directly with this request and insisted that OP be the one to do it. Ann asked OP's wife, her sister, to do this. OP's wife, when it was just her and OP, offloaded a favor she agreed to on OP with pressuring and guilting. The fact that the frustration and resentment over doing this favor comes back around to Ann when she wasn't the one who demanded that he specifically do this when he didn't agree to do this is wrong.\n\nIf she's being told by her sister constantly things like \"if you need anything just ask we're here for you 100%\" and NEVER hearing anything to the contrary from OP, then it's unreasonable to claim that she's totally completely aware that OP is not actually on board with this dynamic to begin with.\n\nShe didn't cry to her sister about OP not making her a sandwich. She cried to her sister because OP, seemingly out of nowhere in Ann's perspective, snapped at her going \"You're trying to turn me into your husband, baby daddy, and servant and you need to leave.\" And that is a terrifying thing to have thrown at you when you're unaware there's been an ongoing frustration with you asking for favors with food accommodations.\n\nSo desperate to put 100% blame on Ann like they're seemingly masterminding this whole ordeal when in reality OP's wife keeps agreeing to degrees of accommodation she's too lazy to follow through with and guilts OP into picking up the slack. It's only natural from Ann's perspective, who has not been told directly even once prior to OP going nuclear that there's an issue here, to be under the impression there wasn't actually an issue to ask OP directly to make her a sandwich when he just made himself one.\n\nAnn is not at fault for her sister's behavior behind closed doors. Even if I personally feel that Ann is asking too much, the fact still remains that nobody told her directly and she's likely being told the exact opposite by OP's wife who refuses to do the actual labor she's agreeing to herself. OP keeps laying the blame on Ann for his wife's behavior and unloaded that in a terrible fashion on her rather than putting his foot down with his own wife and or having a reasonable discussion with Ann about his own boundaries in this situation.  That is why ESH.\n\nAnd I stand by that if he truly believes he's being forced and manipulated into being a husband, father, servant all wrapped up in one because he's being pressured to go out and get food at odd hours by his wife because she's too lazy to uphold her own agreements then he needs to follow through with what he said to Ann and kick her out. Don't say that kind of shit if you don't actually mean it."]}
