You DID agree to do a birthday for Dawn. But you're not a mindreader so if she wanted something or they wanted something they needed to TELL you.", "NTA you did a lovely thing and you did reach out to try and ask Dawn for any particular preferences. You got no ideas back so did it how you thought would be fun. If you\u2019d reached out then ignored what Dawn wanted it would be a different story, but she ignored you so it\u2019s on her if she didn\u2019t get what she wanted.", "YTA.\n\nYou invested laughably minimal effort to make this party enjoyable for Dawn. She didn't reply to your text \u2014 which is rude \u2014 but she's a fifteen-year-old child, and you're an adult. Dawn didn't ask to have a joint birthday with Selena or for you to plan her party. Both of those conditions were imposed upon her by her father. You didn't want to throw this party in the first place and it sounds very much like you took her failure to reply as a convenient \"out\" to entirely prioritize Selena. You could have made a good-faith effort to cater to what you know of Dawn's interests \u2014 even the littlest thing. You could have also texted Dawn's father, and didn't. You could have chosen a generalizable common theme, or even no theme at all. You signed up for the party-planning of your own volition. Your teenage niece missing your text is not a sufficient excuse. Adults are not allowed to spite children. Sorry.\n\n>I told him that I never signed up to do a birthday for Dawn\n\nYes, OP, you did.\n\n>my half brother asked if I could make it a birthday for both girls. I said ok.", "Your brother kinda dumb ngl NTA", "Info: what was the theme? Was there anything written on the cake? How exactly did you include each girl?", "YTA\n\nYou're showing massive favoritism. Beggers can't be choosers but I imagine Dawn has a pretty poor opinion of you for a reason.\n\nThe parents really should decline letting you do anything in the future for either of them if you're going to do this kind of thing.", "Eh soft YTA. You agreed to plan a party and made one text to the birthday girl asking what she wanted. You should have reached out to her parents. It really sounds like you didn't want to plan the party at all for Dawn, and you are showing favoritism to Selena. \n\nAlso, Dawn's dad is TA too. Why didn't he reach out to you too? It didn't absolve you of responsibility but he could at least have given you some ideas, seeing as you haven't thrown her a party before.", ">but she didn't say anything\n\n**NTA** The ball was in her court and she dropped it. She's 15, that's old enough to communicate your interests for a birthday party to the very generous aunt/uncle that's throwing it for you.", "NTA. Your brother is TA. Enjoy the silence from him and continue living your life free of him and the niece.", "YTA. You said in the comments that you know what Dawn likes, but you instead made the party only about Selena. If you have that hard of a time hiding your dislike of Dawn, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to throw her a party. Actually from what you wrote, you didn\u2019t throw her a party at all. You said you would and then failed to do so.", "INFO: What's the reason that your aren't close to Dawn? Is there a legit reason or is it because she's your half-brother's child. I believe you probably aren't really that fond of your half-brother since you keep making that distinction of half when it's not really related to the story.", "> I told him that I never signed up to do a birthday for Dawn \n\nBut you did:\n\n>This year my half brother asked if I could make it a birthday for both girls because they can't afford it and Dawn really likes what I do for Selena's birthday. I said ok.", "Yes your in the wrong", "Maybe Selena didn't know how to answer you.  Maybe Selena felt uncomfortable.  Maybe Selena, a child, needed you to reach out again to make sure you had information to make her a part of the festivities.  Nice of you to agree, but kind of shitty of you to follow through in such a half assed way.\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\n How were you supposed to know what she wanted? You two aren't even close and it was generous of you and Selena to include her...", "Believe me Dawn knows you prefer Selena, so that's probably why she didn't respond.  Favoritism is not a good thing.", "NTA, you said you reached out to Dawn, Dawn did not ask for anything, nor reply to your text with suggestions, what were you suppose to do. This is totally on Dawn and her family.", "NTA. Maybe you could have made more attempts to ask what they wanted, but they knew they hadn\u2019t talked to you as much as you did. You\u2019re not a mind reader.", "NTA but maybe instead of a \"text\", you could have called and actually spoke with Dawn?  I mean, text seem so impersonal and maybe Dawn needed a little personal interaction with you - teenagers can be so picky sometimes.  Sounds like your half brother could have suggested a few ideas himself instead of pawning it off on you.  He seems extremely ungrateful for your effort and personally I blame him more.  He says Dawn likes what you do for Selena but all of a sudden your the bad guy because she didn't like it this time?", "NTA. You asked a 15 year old what she wanted, she didn't respond. I guess you could have asked again, but she was being rude. She knew what the party was like last year and liked it.\n\nYour brother was the AH though, he didn't communicate with either one of you before the party apparently.\n\nIt is a good lesson for your niece, only a limited number of people will offer to throw you a party.

It\u2019s clear you favor one niece and while Dawn should have reached out, if you actually cared about her, you would have pushed harder to get some ideas from her. Also did you make any food Dawn likes? Do you even know anything Dawn likes?

It was rude for her not to reply, but YTA if you didn't reach out to make sure she got the text or at least tried to make a little bit more effort. \n\nYou agreed upon something and then half assed  it because you didn't want to do it. Look the way you are even talking about her. You clearly dislike the girl for whatever reason.\n\nYTA.\n\n Congratulations OP, if it was so damn important to you make sure a 15 year old know you have your favorite, you did it. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f You are really a winner.", "Okay.  I think if we're talking about the birthday of a child it would be generous to follow through even if you think they should, in order to avoid hurting a child.\n\nThis isn't the \"was it my job\" subreddit.  This is AITA.  If you don't have the nuts to just call your damn niece and talk to her about what she wants, make her feel included, make her feel special for her effing birthday, you are indeed the asshole.", "I agree. You reached out and didn\u2019t get a reply or feedback. Your half brother could\u2019ve also provided you with ideas. So, you carried on as usual, in doing what you knew definitively would be wanted by Selena. \nUltimately, you were going to be planning her party anyway and tried to accommodate Dawn after being specifically asked to do so. You can\u2019t read Dawn\u2019s mind and suddenly ignore Selena and her wishes. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not like there is a huge age gap like 15 & 6, so if Dawn or her dad didn\u2019t provide any ideas, I would\u2019ve assumed to go with what you know for Selena and that Dawn & her dad would be appreciative over ANY effort at all", "OP was supposed to be the grown up in the conversation and give a call, make her feel comfortable, make her feel as important and special as she makes the other niece feel.", "And I did it so what is your point?", "No I didn't she should have told me what she likes just like Selena did. She is old enough to do that", "Plus in another comment she says that she does know what Dawn likes but because Dawn didn\u2019t come to OP and tell her (stuff she already knows according to her) then she just ignored Dawns interests and focused on Selena. She definitely has a big grudge against her niece, OP is a petty AH.", "She did asked niece what she wanted, she got no response. Why didn't her dad told op \"dawn would like this or that\"?? He wasn't shy when he asked if he could hijack another kid's birthday.... \n\n Op was generous and so was Selena... this was a party originally for selena, yet she agreed to share the spotlight with her cousin. Op and dawn aren't even close, so how was op to know what dawn wanted?? \n\n>in order to avoid hurting a child.\n\nOh yeah... the old \"if there's a child, one should sacrifice everything\"...", ">You can\u2019t read Dawn\u2019s mind and suddenly ignore Selena and her wishes.\n\nRespectfully, I think this is a bit unrealistic and draconian. OP agreed to plan a party for both girls. Instead of texting Dawn's dad or otherwise attempting to go off what she knows about Dawn, she based the party theme on an exceptionally niche TV show from more than 20 years ago. It's a choice that OP knows is exceptionally unlikely to also cater to the other girl. It deliberately minimizes the chances of the other child feeling included. The 14-year-old doesn't need to get Buffy simply because she requested it; it's a joint party with her cousin. You and I, or anyone else, could spend five minutes thinking of a more generalizable theme that touches on Buffy and that'll also be accessible to someone who hasn't seen it.\n\nYeah, OP's fifteen-year-old niece missed her text, and she should have texted back. If you're an adult and you respond to that by snubbing her at her birthday, you're TA. Ask yourself if you'd really do that to a kid in your family. I wouldn't.", "No you didn't; you threw Selena's birthday party to Selena's specifications and then pretended it was also for Dawn. \"My teenage niece missed my text\" is a pretty hollow excuse. She's a kid. You don't need to be drawn and quartered, but this really lacked empathy, OP. \n\nAnd as a dedicated Buffy fan I must ask... anything ironic about the situation involving a fussy 15-year-old named Dawn??", "You did it badly.", "You\u2019re missing my point. You might not have known the theme Selena wanted this year but you know her favorite cake and favorite foods. I bet you don\u2019t even know Dawns middle name.", "Yup.  She texted her.  Once.  And then just moved on.  Awesome way to make a child feel wanted and important.", ">she based the party theme on an exceptionally niche TV show from more than 20 years ago\n\nThe general point of your comment is all correct, but this was a punch to the gut", "This. I\u2019m shocked how many folks are defending this cold and mean behavior. I bet OP was mad Dawn didn\u2019t respond and went out of her way to make sure Dawn got nothing.", "Selena always tells me what she wants, I don't make the same food and cake every year\n\nAlso I do know what Dawn likes but since she didn't tell me what she wants I went with what Selena said", "So you\u2019re adding petty to the list. Gotcha.", "If you know what Dawn likes and you made no effort at all to include her based on those likes, then YTA. You didn't have to agree to make the party for both girls, but once you did, you needed to ensure that there was something for Dawn as well as Selena. Yes, she should've replied to your text, but you could've called her or her dad, or even just gone with making sure there was a treat for her based on what she likes.", "Info : has dawn's dad been jealous of your bond with your brother? I think he asked you to  do the party not so much for dawn, but more for him"]}
