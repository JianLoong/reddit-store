I can\u2019t decide if she was trying to smooth things over or also shit stir.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 saying his ex \u2018stole\u2019 the ring is ridiculous.

My two cents? Just make sure he knows you feel hurt by Sarah's recent behavior and your MIL enabling her.\n\nFollow his lead on this matter. It's his family's heirloom being flaunted by someone who has no right to do so, but it's still his call (maybe the grandparent's too).\n\nStill, keep Sarah's posse on the uninvited list. Maybe you'll need help to make sure she doesn't show up to the wedding anyway, bc I think MIL will give her a pass *again*.\n\nBest of luck, OP.", "It has no personal value to you though. You're all torqued up about something that barely even existed in your universe until very recently, you have no memories tied to it, it was never intended to be yours even because the chapter was closed before you even arrived on the scene. \n\nSarah won here by getting exactly what she wanted in doing this. Do yourself a favor and stop building this fantasy story around this possession being deeply sentimental and therefore stolen from you and focus on actually living happily ever after instead.", "Haha he is yours, you\u2019re right. MIL can keep dreaming. Say hello to Xmas cards once a year.", "If this were your attitude and mentality towards me I would absolutely enjoy you going low contact with me. \n\nIt sounds like your mother in law had the authority to gift it to whomever she saw fit. Like, sorry that she doesn't like you and clearly yall have bad blood but that doesn't entitle you to a valuable possession of hers just because you've decided your role in the family trumps mil's sentiments on the matter."]}
