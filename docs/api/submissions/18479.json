Also, my MIL behavior .\n\n\nUpdate:  Hi everyone, thank you all for your input, I talked with my fiance about it, and he told me not to bother myself with them and he will take care of everything i told him after reading all your comments that i understand that i didn't have any clam for the ring i just felt angry at sarah and MIL behaviors and stressed because of the wedding and uni exams, last month my fiance grandparents gifted me all the family heirlooms (my MIL didn't get anything because my fiance grandmother didn't like her) and she also gave a certificate that all of them are mine to use or gift as a want, i will be looking at it to see if that ring registers there.", "created_utc": 1685378660, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uzy6m/aita_for_demanding_the_family_ring/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not your ring--it's your fiance's family ring, and he is the one who needs to demand it back.", "ESH\nIt\u2019s not your ring and it\u2019s none of your business. If your fianc\u00e9 wants his family heirloom back he needs to ask for it back and not you. Don\u2019t involve yourself in what has nothing to do with you. \n\nSarah clearly feels some type of way because there is no reason for her to show up at your shower flaunting the ring. And you don\u2019t have to have her at your wedding if you don\u2019t want her there.", "ESH. You don't get to demand anything. But I'd think twice before marrying into this family.", "ESH. Everyone is awful and I can elaborate but really there\u2019s no point. \n\nHis ex-fianc\u00e9 and best friend is hanging around, wearing his family diamond and you\u2019re still going through with this marriage?", "ESH. What a group of horrible people", "I mean, Sarah's definitely one for flaunting it in front of you but yta also... it isn't your ring and being engaged doesn't give you some kind of claim to it.", "ESH. She sucks for flaunting it like that and she definitely shouldn\u2019t be invited to the wedding anymore. But it was gifted to her and trying to get it back is just fanning the flames and causing more drama. Enjoy your beautiful ring and your marriage and don\u2019t stoop to her level.", "ESH, it's not your ring to demand back. Leave this to your fiance and his mother to work out. As well, stop socializing with the ex fiance, she's taking far to much pleasure in upsetting you. Stop giving her the satisfaction. Act indifferent towards her, it'll drive her insane.", "I feel for you but it\u2019s not the ring. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to demand the ring. And as for Sarah being invited to the wedding I would hold that ground. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to get his mother in check now. If he doesn\u2019t then your life is going to be hell!", "OP Sarah has the ring but YOU have the man.  You need to let it go and move on.  The fact that Sarah wore the ring to your party shows that she's a spiteful, ugly person and you are within your rights to not invite her to the wedding. Stop sinking to her level. Your fiance gave her that ring== why would you even want to have it?   ESH  mostly Sarah but you are being petty and jealous over nothing and ruining the happy vibe of your own wedding and creating drama within your future husband's family.", "ESH\n\nSarah was showing off her ring as if she was mocking you, and you were demanding a ring that was hers and not yours.", "It's not your ring.

Demanding a ring that hadn't been given to you? yuck. It wasn't yours. Yes fiance said it was stolen but HE needs to get it back, not you. \n\nMIL's just awful.  Sarah is gross for her petty Betty attitude, don't invite her back to the wedding, or make the cost of admission that ring if you want it so badly.", "ESH. It\u2019s not your ring. It\u2019s Sarah\u2019s ring. If the family feels like she stole it, it\u2019s up to your fianc\u00e9 to take legal action to get it returned to them. That being said, it was rude & petty of her to wear it to your party.", "NTA.", "ESH. \n\nAlso, why was Sarah at your bachelorette party if you don't care to be around her?", "NTA.

Engagement rings are gifts given in expectation of getting married. If the marriage never happens, the ring should be returned.\n\nSarah is an AH for keeping it and flaunting it.\n\nYou are an AH because this is something for your fianc\u00e9 and his family to deal with, not you. The ring isn't yours and never has been. If you're lucky, maybe your fianc\u00e9 will get it back and give it to you someday.", "YTA\n\nIt isn\u2019t your ring.

Let it go and let her eat your dust.", "YTA... it's not your ring either. Why do you want a second hand proposal ring anyway?", "So are women not allowed to wear diamond rings anymore? I wear rings on the wedding finger, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m married/engaged. \n\nIt is Sarah\u2019s ring now. You don\u2019t get to demand it back at all. She didn\u2019t steal it.

What gives you the right to demand the ring back when it don't belong to you???\n\nGranted, Sarah is an ahole for showing off her ring, and there's a 99.9% chance she did it on purpose to pee you off and force you to retaliate, which she got what she wanted. \n\nBUT it's her ring so yeah YTA!", "Can barely read this because of your terrible spelling.", "The ex is an AH but she didn't steal anything technically and I don't think it's your place to ask for the ring back. You're not TA either but just enjoy your man,the family members that are worth it and don't let that girl bother you with her childish antics and do not invite her to the wedding.", "You\u2019re all obnoxious and entitled", "YTA for demanding the ring.  \nWhy as she even at your Bachelorette  if you don't like her?", "Not your ring. Never was your ring. YTA.\n\nThis is why, IMO, jewlery goes thru the female line. Again, just my opinion.", "NTA - you don\u2019t owe her a wedding invitation, especially while she\u2019s flaunting the family heirloom engagement ring your fianc\u00e9 gave her before they broke up. \n\nIt\u2019s super weird that your MIL considers her family enough to keep it, but it would probably be wise to stay out of that one.", "YTA for making this s*** up.  19 days ago you were talking about your sister's mil trying to force you to marry her other son.  Seriously, get a hobby.", "ESH but you\u2019re the worst.\n\nThat ring has absolutely nothing to do with you. Nothing.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 had the opportunity to get the ring back when his engagement to Sarah ended. For whatever reason he chose not to. This means that the ring belongs to Sarah and has done so for years.\n\nYou have no clue why Sarah chose to wear HER ring. Maybe it was pettiness. If so she fits in with the rest in this story.\n\nYour SIL should\u2019ve had the sense to mind her own business and keep her mouth shut to you. But she apparently wanted to stir shit.\n\nSomeone told MIL about your reaction or she overheard you with SIL or your reaction was visibly evident to everyone. I can\u2019t decide if she was trying to smooth things over or also shit stir.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 saying his ex \u2018stole\u2019 the ring is ridiculous. He had the choice to act on the matter and didn\u2019t. Nothing to do with ex or MIL, that was his choice.\n\nYou then escalated this ridiculousness by demanding that Sarah give you HER ring because your FIL told you something that is clearly wrong but fit with your personal entitlement and greed.\n\nYou\u2019ve been watching way too many non-reality reality shows.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Basically, it comes down to if the state determines that engagement rings are conditional gifts that only become the property of the recipient if the wedding goes through or unconditional gifts that belong to the recipient no matter what.
