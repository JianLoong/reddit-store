They were also over last week and the week before.  Typically, I am not consulted on these visits, I am just informed of them, sometimes with little or no notice at all. The visit two weeks ago had 30 people (this one I had lots of notice). Last week was 15. During these previous visits, I feel I was a good and welcoming host. I made food,  cleaned up, made conversation, etc. \n\nThis afternoon, I was exhausted and not feeling well after a really busy work week and sleep issues.  My husband and I have a young daughter who also came home from daycare coughing. We've been dealing with boughts of sickness plus some really big transitions in the last few weeks.\n\nAround 3pm, my husband informed me that family members were coming over (6 in total). I told him I wasn't feeling well and was upset he didn't ask me about it before confirming.  I was also upset because we had only had one dinner together this week. The previous night he had been at a work dinner and was over at his dad's earlier in the week, plus we'd already had the family. \n\nHe initially disregarded me and left the room, but he later apologized and reassured me that next week would be quiet and we would spend time together and I could just be upstairs tonight and not have to worry about cleaning anything up. Plus dinner was taken care of already. \n\nI had an early dinner with my daughter and put her to bed at 7, which is when his family showed up.  I stayed upstairs in bed initially but went down and briefly explained I was not feeling well and our daughter was sleeping. \n\nHowever, there was a lot of noise with kids running around who woke up my daughter, so I went down again around 9. At this point, my husband was slurring his words drunk because when he gets together with his dad, they drink.\n\nWhen I realized he was slurring his words, I lost it. I asked him to stop drinking, in front of his family, because he would be grumpy and hungover the next day. I told him I was tired of it and tired of cleaning up after everyone. Honestly, I can't remember everything I said because I was raging but I do know that I didn't swear or yell, though I was raising my voice. I told him that his behavior was unhealthy and that it was not okay.  I basically had a heated argument with him in front of his family, clearly making them feel uncomfortable. \n\nBut they also knew I was sick yet stayed until after 10pm while the kids ran around making noise. They stayed late earlier in the week too and at that time didn't offer any help. \n\nMy husband and his dad are both passed out now.  The other family and kids have left.  I'm embarrassed that I lost my composure, but I am also just so fed up. I feel knots in my gut and guilt for not holding it in.

That is absolutely unacceptable, it's your house and these things need to be agreed on BEFORE being planned.\n\n....But the part that really infuriates me is...If these are his dinners/gatherings, and he refuses to even include you in the planning (or even agreement to have people over), why are you cooking for and cleaning up after?!?!\n\n...Why on earth isn't he taking care of the food and cleanup?\n\nAlso, getting drunk constantly at family dinners is a huge red flag to me. Probably because my father's side of the family has a lot of alcoholism, and they're the only people I know who do exactly that.", "NTA\n\nYou should have a say in this as its your house too and seems they are really taking advantage of you.", "NTA. First off, Wow, I would not put up with this inconsiderate behaviour. Your husband takes your time and wellbeing for granted.

I would apologize for that, but jeez, I surely hope he knows he's in the wrong for just inviting people over without your permission..", "NTA. He should have more respect for you. Your needs should come before his drinking buddies. That's quite often to have family over and you cook, clean and host everytime.", "NTA. You cant hold this in forever. There sounds like some serious alcoholism and dysfunction going on.  Seek counseling.", "NTA, I think it was needed for you to speak up, unfortunately your husband might not remember it later.\n\nI am so sick of family drama, where everyone, blood or not, is not respected. You are not the Payed help, it is your home for heaven's sake.\n\nYou need to set some really strong boundaries that your husband and his family should respect.", "Honestly, NTA at all. \n\nYour husband should not be making plans for guests to come over (family or not) without a conversation with you beforehand.

Approach him when he's sober and lay it out to him - this won't be happening again. You've had enough, and it isn't fair. You'll need to think of consequences if he ignores this.", "NTA.  Maybe this is a cultural thing, but I absolutely cannot imagine in any world where people would need to be told that staying late and being loud when one of the two adults who own the house is in bed sick. \n\nYou shouldn't have to have these conversations with your husband -- you shouldn't have to ask for basic consideration and respect.", "NTA - you may have lost your composure (although you are very hard on yourself and I'm not sure how reliable of a narrator you are in that regard). But damn, your husband needed to hear every word. He disregarded your feelings, and it sounds like he's still tied to his family's apron strings. I would lose my shit if my husband repeatedly did this to me.", "NTA - delivery was a little sh*tty, but you were at your breaking point. Totally understandable. He should respect you enough to factor in your feelings and opinions - and he clearly doesn't.", "NTA he is completely disregarding you and the kid.  He clearly does not know how hard cooking for that many people are.  I would have said hell no to 30 people being over for dinner.  He needs to prioritise his family more.  He is negating his daughters health and they can stay away for a full week to let her get better.", "NTA.\n\nSometimes you have to go ballistic for folks to get the point.\n\nYour husband needs a clue by four, unfortunately he might have been too drunk to remember. You need to make it clear to him his family is NEVER to come to your home unless he gets the OK from you.on advance. Especially not this often. If he wants to see them that badly, he can go visit them.

Drain the liquor.  No more liquor.  If they bring it, drain it.  No liquor.  If H buys it, drain it.  If H locks it up, call a locksmith.  Then drain it.  \n\n2.) Only keep food on hand for your nuclear family.  Do not cook for more than the number of people in nuclear family.  H's family shows up,  H orders take out.\n\n3.) If you're not consulted with at least a couple of days of prep, and you don't consent (and for the love of God, don't consent more than a couple of times a month), don't participate.  If they show up unannounced after this, take D to a lovely and expensive local hotel while they party in your dining room (with take-out).  Check in.  Watch Disney movies.  Stay overnight.\n\n4.)  Make an appointment with a therapist.  Insist that H comes with you.  If he refuses, attend therapy on your own.  You need a lot of support.\n\n5.) Talk to a lawyer to make sure you're protecting yourself.  It's possible that when you stand up for yourself and stop tolerating H's behavior, he won't accept the inconvenience.  If you need to get job skills or more education before living without him is financially feasible, find the shortest possible program and pursue before getting militant on steps 1-4.  \n\nI'm sitting here praying you don't live in a culture where women are supposed to accept this sort of thing with a smiles on their faces.", "NTA\n\nSome people with substance abuse disorder convince themselves they\u2019re fine because they \u201conly drink socially\u201d.
