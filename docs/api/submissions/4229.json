If I may be blunt, who gives a fuck how the ex's girlfriend feels about any of this?  I would throw that right back in his face with peals of laughter.  I think your response to this was perfect and probably kinder than I would have been.  The nerve of some people, lol!\n\nI think your views on death and how to talk about it with kids is great.  I hate when adults talk down to kids, like they're dumb or incapable of handling the truth.  Just tell them the damn truth.  That's what kids want, and they deserve to have it.  And I'm with you on the religious teaching.  There is no proof of any of that, and she has no place trying to inure your kids to religion.  If anyone should be angry here, it's you for what she tried to teach your kids.", "NTA keep your kids away from this looney toon", "NTA - if she wants kids to put into her mindset, she can have one of her own.", "NTA \nBut hear me out: if he is as narcistic as you say, there is no way that he will always \"wear the mask of the good dad\" in front of your kids.\nHe will always find ways to manipulate them and take power over them. \nYour post is the proof. It already started.", "You are not the asshole. \nI don't have kids but I'd be so pissed if I was in your position. It's bad enough that some random person (which is basically what I see her as) is trying to instill their views on your children. \nBut then they have the audacity to be mad at you for teaching your kids the way you think it's best for them. As a non religious person I got pissed just from reading this.", "NTA - You were just consoling your child. \n\nI would argue that how you address death isn't as important as the concept of death itself. \"Passing away,\" \"dying,\" they're all talking about the same thing, and using all of those terms interchangeably could help destigmatize the concept of death by becoming more familiar with the various terms used to address it. Either way, coping with the idea of death isn't easy for some people, especially children, so I applaud you for working with her to overcome it.", "NTA. Everything you said is reasonable and spot on..You can't overstep here. As far as over stepping, it's 100% the GF for trying to \"correct\" something you have taught your child and push her own beliefs. People die. That is life. Even if you believe in heaven/hell/afterlife/etc - people die. Her being uncomfortable with your child saying \"died\" vs \"passed away\" is ridiculous and that discomfort is nothing you should have to be worried about or be mindful of.\n\nI can't imagine coparenting with a narcissistic. You seem to be very realistic and reasonable. 1000% NTA", "NTA! Those are your children not hers! I\u2019m a Christian but would never stuff my views down others throats especially someone else\u2019s children! And I\u2019ll be damned if someone tried to teach my kids something I didn\u2019t want taught! Do let them bully you! Do what you think is best for your kids.", "NTA, your ex\u2019s GF is not entitled to dictate how you raise your children. As a stepfather, I know that\u2019s not a \u201cthing.\u201d Co-parenting is hard enough without step parents trying to impose third or fourth opinions.", "NTA - good job keeping your kids, educated and curious.

Keep it factual and unbiased. \n\nAllow your kids to ask gf age appropriate questions. There are quite a few good kids' books out there, and you can always google together. Make researching a bonding activity.\n\nETA: you could also contact a death doula and ask for their input.", "NTA.  It's your children.  You and your ex, not his girlfriend, get to raise your children in the manner that you see fit. \n\nAs long as you're not contradicting the rules of behavior in their father's home (including that they need to mind her), you're on solid ground.", "NTA. \n1) You > ex-husband's gf.\n2) I commend you on speaking openly and honestly with your children about death.\n\nBut, I am a bit confused as to why wording contributes to your daughter's anxiety on this topic.

That doesn't make sense. Passed away, died, dead, kicked the bucket, bought the farm, unalive, there just words. I'm completely lost why the words matter. Religious or not, who cares?

I had asked about what happened to my great-grandmother, who died before I was born, and my mom explained what happens when a person dies.\n\nIf a close relative, friend, pet, etc. dies, that's the perfect time IMO to discuss death, as otherwise the kid will go around wondering why Grandpa isn't around anymore.

One of my most reliable coping mechanisms for my occasional bouts of anxiety is to remind myself that soon I will die and the thing I'm worried about won't matter at all.
