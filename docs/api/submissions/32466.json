Our relationship was perfect until we got married 3 years after we got together and then he started restricting me from a lot of stuff.\n\nHe was always the jealous, over protective type but never as bad as he got after we got married. He guilt tripped me into dropping all of my male friends (even cousins), he would not let mee go out until he approved what I was wearing and he threw away all of my even mildly revealing dresses when I was at work one day.\n\nBut I loved him and stayed with him for 3 years and during those 3 years I realised that I am bisexual but I never told my husband because I was scared that he would force me to be a shut in and never even let me hang out with my girls and he would make me drop them too.\n\nFast forward, he got worse and worse until eventually I ended up getting a divorce about 2 years ago. It was a messy divorce and he tried his best to slow down the process as much as he could. He also was convinced that I'm only divorcing him because I was cheating on him because he has been so \"perfect\" to me so why would I want to divorce him?\n\nIt took a while and a lot of therapy for me to trust people again and to start dating again. Eventually I decided to explore my sexuality and now I have been dating a close friend of 5years \"Amy\" for about ~6 months. \n\nI don't know how but he found out that I am dating a woman and he has been blasting my socials with spare accounts about how this proves I was cheating on him and how its unfaithful in general for me to hide my sexuality from him. How he deserved to know and I am a d*** for not telling him. He also ended up telling my parents (who I am VERY low contact with for being not good parents) and they are also blasting me with calls and texts about how they didn't raise an unfaithful wh*** and I shouldn't have hidden it from him.\n\nI confided in some friends and they all say it wasn't unfaithful of me to tell him but he deserved to know and now I'm starting to feel like the bad guy... so Reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1701883359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c8zxz/aita_for_hiding_my_sexuality_from_my_ex_husband/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He didn\u2019t deserve to know shit. He was abusive and you owe him nothing. Good for you for leaving. Also: consider getting better friends who don\u2019t side with your abuser over you.

That\u2019s downright sick of them.\n\nEdit: forgot to address the bad parent behavior", "NTA - When you are in an abusive relationship many of the standard rules about being open and honest go out the window. He was already unreasonably controlling and telling him this about yourself would only make matters worse.\n\nThe fact he has reacted like this (2 years after a divorce no less) proves you were correct to have kept it a secret. He still feels like he is entitled to control you even now.\n\nYour friends who are telling you he deserved to know are, hopefully, just being naive to what the dynamics of an abusive relationship is like.

Even without all of the context of his abusive behavior, he was not owed your coming out to him. In fact, it's probably a blessing to your own wellbeing that you never did while you were together. This is absolutely just a weapon he's using to keep abusing you. Protect your peace and do everything you can to avoid him.", " NTA. Divorcing someone means you cut them out from your life (since there\u2019s no kids to tie you together). He doesn\u2019t deserve to know what you do with your time, with your sexuality, nothing.

You did not know yourself completely, so how you couldn't tell him something you did not know.  His abusing you is about him not you.  He has a need for power and striking out a people he believes are vulnerable.\n\nAfter the divorce you got therapy and healed, explored your feelings and found out some things about yourself.  None of this is any of his business, you don't owe him an explanation or anything.   \n\nI would contact a lawyer and get a cease and desist letter sent to him advising him that you will seek a restraining order and possibly slander.  Then block him and all of the others.", "No, NTA.  This man abused you psychologically.  You were 100% right not to trust him and goood on you for leaving him. You owe him nothing.

He's pathetic. So are the parents. \n\nGlad op is free and dating her bestie.", "NTA and jumping onto this comment to add, you also did not owe him way back when. it would have been nice to let him know and to talk about it but obviously he did not scream \"safe space\". \n\nif you sexuality did not jeopardize your relationship in any way, there is no need t o know. it is up to you to tell given how comfortable to you feel about it.", "stalker \"abusive\" ex-husband", "No he doesn't deserve Jack shit.
