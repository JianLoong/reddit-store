We heard a thunk & all looked for the source of the noise. We saw a jeep backing - repeatedly - into a parked truck. \nWe were all shocked & stopped walking to watch as the woman driving backed into the back of the white truck over and over. \n\nThe truck was parked in a legal space, but it was a very large truck & stuck out into the lot about 2 feet further than other cars parked around him.  After the 4th time the Jeep hit the truck, a couple walking by stopped & offered to direct her. The Jeep driver got out & looked at the back of her Jeep & the truck. She got back in & even with the couple directing her, she hit the truck once more before finally pulling parallel & making her way to the exit. \n\nAs she passed us heading to the exit, it became clear she was going to leave after hitting this truck at least 4 times (may have been more before we stumbled onto this scene). So many people saw this & said nothing, but I just couldn\u2019t. If that was my vehicle that had been hit repeatedly I would want someone to say something. \n\nI yelled loud enough for her to hear through her open window, \u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave after you hit that truck over & over? You\u2019re not even going to leave a note?\u201d  \n\nShe yelled back that her car was more damaged than his. I said I didn\u2019t care - she hit the truck & she was responsible for any damage she caused. I said that leaving was wrong & she needed to take responsibility for what she did.  She pulled the Jeep over & said fine, she\u2019d leave a note. I said good, that was the right thing to do.\n\nMy family urged me toward our car & I went when I saw Jeep lady walking over to the truck. I hope she actually did leave a note & wasn\u2019t pretending to get out of the situation. There were at least 20 people watching her who knew what happened. \n\nWe got to our car & my daughter and husband both told me that I embarrassed them by calling out Jeep lady. This hurt me so much! I hate that I embarrassed them, but how could I just leave after what I witnessed? What she was doing was just so wrong. I asked them if they\u2019d feel that way if it was their car she had hit.  Would they want someone to stop her then? They said it wasn\u2019t my business & saying something made me look like a jerk. \n\nSo, should I have handled that differently?

I'm kinda floored your family was embarrassed. If I were them, I'd be proud of how you confidently took a stand!", "NTA. When it comes to crime, \"it's none of my business\" is a mindset that has cost people their lives. You're not on someone's case for littering or jaywalking or nabbing gum from a Walmart. Her hit-and-run could leave someone on the hook for a significant amount of money \u2014 we don't know if the car was borrowed or leased or rented. There is a real, human victim on the other end. And you didn't scream at 911 for the cops or tackle her to the ground. You just provided enough peer-pressure for someone to do the right thing, and by the sound of it, she did.", "NTA. Jeep lady was committing a crime (damage to a vehicle and hit-and-run) and you were the only one to say something about it.\nI feel like people have this mindset right now that if you see something wrong, don\u2019t rock the boat. That it\u2019s easier to just be quiet and look the other way.", "There\u2019s a video of a lady hitting a car, and when bystanders tried to stop her, she tried to run them over and started hit other cars. Take a video make sure to get the licenses plate and give it to the car owner", "I would not have confronted her. That\u2019s not a normal thing to do and someone doing that is likely enraged at that person and isn\u2019t something I want to get involved in directly. I would however take down her license plate, get a picture on my phone if I was fast enough and then I\u2019d have waited a little bit to see if the person came out soon. If not, I\u2019d have called the police to report it and id have left a note with my own contact info as a witness. I might even report it and leave my info with mall security too.", "It makes you picky\u2026 I can't remember the right word. But it's not an asshole. \n\nYou did not embarrass your family and if they feel like you embarrassed them then that speaks volumes about their beliefs.", "NTA\n\nHowever, let's take advantage of the technology offered in our current millennium by whipping out the phone and getting video, because that is what ends up proving useful anyway, with details such as the license plate.\n\nLet's also heed the divisive stochastic effects in certain areas and the non negligible possibility that such an unhappy motorist will hear your righteous admonition but respond with road rage including possible misuse of a weapon in your general direction. Your 71 year old mother may be a tad slow ducking for cover.", "YTA Never confront a stranger.  You got lucky. You could have left the note with her plate. You didn't even check that note, because you don't really care.  You put your family at risk just to signal your virtue, but you did nothing to help the owner of they truck.
