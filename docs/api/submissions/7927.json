Does he understand what your daily schedule look like? If not- I suggest he prioritize spending more time with your kids. He\u2019s really missing out on the best time in their childhood. \n\nDo you know the types of cases he works with all day?

I suggest listening to the Mom Room Podcast. She totally gets it. Women are so often the default parent and studies have shown how much more housework women typically do. You need to sit down with your husband and talk about division of household responsibilities and how you are feeling.

I\u2019m also in the field (on the legal side), so I see first hand how much of a toll being law enforcement can take on a person. That does not excuse him from his role as a parent and partner. It should not all default to you and he SUCKS for basically making it sound like you do nothing. You both need to understand expectations for the other person and divide the job of being a parent.

She omitted key facts in her original post. \n\nYou need to check your misplaced judgement at the door.", "OP I totally respect that. Believe me I\u2019m NOT judging another working mom, but in all fairness that\u2019s now how you described your situation in your original post. \n\nI understand 60+ hours. It\u2019s hard as hell! It\u2019s exhausting.  (I\u2019m sure 70 hrs from 2am - 2 pm is beyond hard)\n\nTell hubby he is 100% responsible for his garage and give him a deadline to get it under control and to check his attitude at the door until the garage is done.", "Let me guess Data Girl\u2026you\u2019re a judgmental AH??", "Well if it's just the usual level of stuff you'd expect with kids then I imagine he's taking out other frustrations on you. The state of the house was just an easy target. NTA but if this becomes a regular thing he might want to use his EAP to get some professional help.", "Yeah that sounds really lopsided and s*****. I'm sure his job is stressful and long hours aren't easy but it sounds like he expects you to be all of the domestic chores on top of having your own full-time job. NTA he sucks", "Ok. It\u2019s just a weird shift time overall.  I have worked 12 hour shifts in hospitals and other places. And I never seen it that\u2019s makes a life nearly impossible.", "I adore my children, this has nothing to do with them. They\u2019re little and they\u2019re exhausting to keep up with by myself. \n\nI\u2019m one of 5 kids, both my parents were home every night, and my mom worked part-time for 10 years. I always had both parents around up until I was 16, when my dad died. Both my parents contributed to maintaining the house, and it clearly made a huge difference in their relationship and keeping the house clean.", ">Believe me I\u2019m NOT judging another working mom\n\nThat is EXACTLY what you did. You assumed that she works less hours than you and that her husband actually gets things done around the house. You belittled her situation by saying she has one less kid. Your entire judgement was based on \"I CAN DO EVEN MORE THAN YOU, SO YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY WRONG!\" \n\nEven after OP pointed out that all of your assumptions were incorrect,  you didn't edit your judgement.", "It sounds like you're not happy at how much time your husband works, and that he doesn't give you much help with the kids. Have you talked explicitly about that part?", "Yeah, he told me he would happily switch places with me. Over the past week, been much better about helping with the kiddos after I made it very clear to him that I need more help there. I guess he took that as his opportunity to get up on his high horse."]}
