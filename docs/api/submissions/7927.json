He\u2019s really missing out on the best time in their childhood. \n\nDo you know the types of cases he works with all day?

You need to sit down with your husband and talk about division of household responsibilities and how you are feeling.

I\u2019m also in the field (on the legal side), so I see first hand how much of a toll being law enforcement can take on a person. That does not excuse him from his role as a parent and partner. It should not all default to you and he SUCKS for basically making it sound like you do nothing. You both need to understand expectations for the other person and divide the job of being a parent.

Your stressed, he\u2019s tired. It takes a lot of communication which sounds super clich\u00e9. I also work in the judicial system. If one of us has had a particularly bad day we tell each other. Maybe he had a suicide that shift or for me we had a bad case that involved kids. We both lived to learn with a bit of a dirtier house while the kids were young.

House stuff, school stuff, sports/activity stuff, cooking, cleaning, all of it on his own. He stopped complaining about things the first time, he was me for a week.

What you describe is the classic distorted idea that raising young children and running a household is not a full-time job in and of itself. Add to your load, you are also working (I assume) 40 hours per week outside the household. Seems like you are as exhausted and harried as your husband. As you are both working all hours, perhaps getting a part-time maid to take care of the housework might be a solution.

Personally in my house we prioritize housework certain things always get done but other things we can tolerate letting go if we just don\u2019t have the energy. Don\u2019t get me wrong we struggle with it sometimes but we try to understand where each other is at because we both have physically demanding jobs. Your husband needs to respect that there are many factors contributing to what you can realistically get done each day while also having time to breath. I hope he gets over himself but if he keeps gaslighting and putting it all on you that\u2019s not healthy and you don\u2019t deserve that.", "NTA!

What a completely ignorant comment. \n\nI imagine the life of an officer can be very stressful and exhausting but to say you are lazy without even conversing about how difficult your day is with work and the kids is selfish.
