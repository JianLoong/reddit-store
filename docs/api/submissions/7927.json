I\u2019m also in the field (on the legal side), so I see first hand how much of a toll being law enforcement can take on a person. That does not excuse him from his role as a parent and partner. It should not all default to you and he SUCKS for basically making it sound like you do nothing. You both need to understand expectations for the other person and divide the job of being a parent.

For a long time women were banned from the work force and told that their little lady brains couldn't handle having a job. They were told how lucky they were to have a husband who provided for them, how much harder his life was, and how important it was to run his life, run the household, raise the children, complete their \"wifely duties\" whether they wanted to or not, be obedient and pretty and doting and if they got beaten up they deserved it. After all, they couldn't divorce, work, have a bank account, or own property.\n\nWhen women entered the work force, they learned that it was not actually harder than running an entire family alone. They were lied to and manipulated to be servants for their husbands, sacrificing their lives for him to enjoy one free of the worrying, organizing, planning, prioritizing, remembering, and actually *doing* that it takes. The \"women's work\" that was framed as so easy and worthless was actually the hard parts that men did not want to deal with. And despite the fact that women are wholly in the workforce, too many men still refuse to participate in their own life. They believe they're entitled to the labor of their wife and further their own careers on the backs of women they see as beneath them. The labor it takes to do what you do is valuable and they fight tooth and nail to deny it. They burden the lives of the women they claim to love, ignore the pleading for equality, and feign incompetence to hurt their own families. It's abusive, and is often packaged with other types of abuse they feel entitled to inflict. Their intent is more akin to hiring an employee than entering a partnership with someone they love. \n\nIf your husband believes his time, effort, needs, wants, and contributions are inherently worth more than yours, he believes you're inferior to him. If he would rather add more to your overflowing plate than miss out on hobbies while you have none, he is exploiting you.
