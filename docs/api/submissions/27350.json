That she wouldn't pay for an open bar?\n\nThis sounds like a BYOB type event. I have never attended such a wedding in the US. Not putting it down, just curious.", "NTA - they literally teach you on AA that your addiction is yours to manage and no one else\u2019s responsibility. If your mom was truly an advocate she\u2019d see your SIL as a multifaceted human who is not defined by her struggles. Your mom is not helping her by asking the world to over accommodate or refusing to see her outside of her addiction. Your mom means well but is insanely out of her depth and out of line. \n\nCongrats on your nuptials. I hope you got lit and laid on your wedding night \ud83e\udd23", "NTA.\n\nThat is some entitlement by mom to require your reception to be dry to cater to SIL.  Your SIL needs to be able to co-exist in a room with people drinking or leave.  It is difficult to require everyone around you to not drink because you are an alcoholic.", "NTA\n\nSIL and mom are assholes. You have no obligation to make your event dry because your SIL has a drinking problem. (Sounds like that's the least of her problems, TBH.)\n\nYou SHOULD have addressed it when mom first talked about making it dry. Might have avoided some drama. But that's minor on the scale of things.", "Nta. Did your mom pay for the wedding? Is that why she got to decide it would be dry? You should have had security escort your SIL out.", "NTA.\n\nI'd have said no from the start, let the drinking begin when guests arrive.  Her being an alcoholic is her issue, not yours.  Either she can control herself or she can not be places where it's around.  And after screaming at you once I'm shocked you didn't have her ejected on her ass.", "NTA It's your wedding, not SIL's. I don't understand why anyone would expect the bride or groom to cater to anyone of any \"special needs\". It's like throwing a barbecue, but without meat, because someone is bringing a vegan as a plus-one. It's just so wrong to mess it up for everybody else for the sake of just one person.", "I\u2019m a recovered alcoholic and though weddings were tough for me in the beginning, alcohol is literally EVERYWHERE. Gas stations. Grocery stores. Restaurants. If she\u2019s tempted to drink at your wedding she\u2019ll be tempted elsewhere. It\u2019s not up to you or your family to manage her problem. That\u2019s codependency. She needs to know what she is okay with being around, and if she doesn\u2019t want to be around alcohol she can leave. I\u2019m queen of the 9pm / Irish exit because usually if people are drinking, by 9pm that\u2019s when people get rowdy haha. NTA", "NTA.  Your wedding your rules.  Your SIL is responsible for her own issue and controlling that issue.  It was never your mothers place to decide it was going to be a dry wedding.", "NTA. Your day your wedding.", "NTA ... unless SIL never leaves her home alcohol exists. Restaurant alcohol Hotels alcohol. She needs to deal with it. Just say No!!", "NTA. You were super  kind by still inviting your Sil, because honestly, you could have excluded her all together", "NTA If she can't be around alcohol, it isn't the world that needs to remove it for her. She needs to remove herself from it.", "NTA her alcoholism isn't your problem. And ngl your mom sucks. Please grow a spine and shut her down next time. Just because your SIL can't handle her shit doesn't mean the world has to cater to her - and I say that as an alcoholic in recovery (6 years sober and counting).", "NTA.

My mom was an alcoholic and while we tried to make things as easy as possible for her it wasn't our job to keep alcohol away from her. Sometimes temptation is there and it just has to be faced.", "NTA. It\u2019s your SIL\u2019s responsibility to be in charge of her sobriety. You were gracious enough to have a partially dry wedding and made it clear what time that would change. Your mother coddling SIL is not helping anyone.", "Ugh, family drama. You're not the asshole for wanting to have a good time at your own wedding. SIL needs to chill and get her shit together.

It's up to SIL to manage her alcoholism or not. You shouldn't be expected to have a dry wedding for her benefit", "NTA, she can leave with the under 21 and take your mother with her.", "And take OP's mom with her", "It was an outdoor BYOB event. I love my mom to pieces, but she is really overprotective of my SIL because she had a lot of struggles in life that I didn't. Yes my Mom and Dad helped pay for my wedding.", "Lol I will admit at that point I grabbed my best friend who was my MOH and we got hammered. My husband opted to have a small drink and we don't talk about the poor hotel room lol.", "Yeah like in the first few months of sobriety it makes sense to avoid being around alcohol especially in conjunction with stressful events (which wedding are for some people, and it makes sense for people in your life to help facilitate that during that period. But that facilitation applies to not having alcohol at family dinners, not your SILs wedding.", "And Al-Anon teaches that we can't love someone sober.", "Mom knew, she just \"forgot\".", "I was trying not to ruin anyone's good time or make anyone uncomfortable. My mom was trying to \"pretend there is no alcohol so there shall not be any\". It was right in the invitation I made that specifically said 20 and under need to be out by 730 as alcohol will be allowed at 8. It was bold face font. You couldn't miss it.", "Well, you are NTA, but something is weird about this. I've never heard of a mom prioritizing a daughter-in-law's substance problems over a daughter's wedding wishes.", "Dead as hell \ud83d\udc80\ud83e\udd23 good for you!", "Hah. Yeah, I saw your additional post down below about it being prominent on the invitations.\n\nYou handled everything right - sorry your SIL and mom were jerks about it.\n\nHave a great life!", "My mom views me as a success. SIL not so much so in order to help make her a success everyone around SIL must cater to the needs no matter how outrageous. SIL could have left for the hotel I paid for but she stuck around. She had options and decided to not use them. Ever since my brother met this chic my mom had always taken her side, no matter how ridiculous the argument.", "Mom probably doesn\u2019t want SIL to relapse and for it to affect her son/grandkids", "I feel you.  Mom's an enabler who is addicted to being the \"fixer\"/\"hero\".  SIL showed up with all sorts of problems, and mom was the hero who helped get her through those.  She got addicted to her role as being the one to save SIL from herself/her problems, and now, that's her main goal.  Mom will stomp any boundary or bully any person, including her own daughter, if it means she can \"fix\" things for SIL.  In her mind, it's *right* what she's doing because poor SIL had a tough life/has a disease/can't help herself, and you OP had a good life and just *want* alcohol at your reception, so surely SIL has the greater need and should be sided with!  And it just so happens this would make mom the hero again, how convenient.  \n\nOn the flip side, if she goes against SIL, then she's not just no longer the hero/fixer, but the villain who is telling SIL no.  And we can't have that.  \n\nMy mom is the same way, and I'm the \"success\" who evidently isn't allowed to set any boundaries my sister doesn't like or else I'm \"being mean\".  But my sister can act however she wants and we just have to \"be understanding\" because \"she has issues that make it hard for her that we could never understand\".", "I sounds like it\u2019s because brother is The Golden Boy - she\u2019s prioritizing his Happy Family over  her daughter. Because she\u2019s \u201calready a success\u201d?? BS - she\u2019s catering to her baby boy. NTA congrats on the marriage!! Go NC with drunken witch SIL & poor lil golden boy brother. LC for mommy dearest.", "Ah, well, I'm glad you didn't cave to her demands. Time for SIL to start wearing big-girl-pants and Mom to stop coddling her.", "[deleted]", "Oh now I get it.  I was thinking SIL was her new husband's sister and not her brothers wife!  That makes much more sense.", "She just hates me for some reason. She was more mad that she wasn't allowed to control everything. She hates that I'm close with the above mentioned people, especially my niece.", "NTA Recovered alcoholic here. Went to a wedding a few months ago. I went to the reception where every guest was given half a dozen drink tickets. I passed my drink tickets out to other folks, had a lovely homemade raspberry lemonade from the bar and then skipped the after party so the drinkers wouldn\u2019t feel the need to tone themselves down for my sake. I\u2019m responsible for my own sobriety. Not anyone else. Mom and SIL should have left with the under age crowd.", "This was YOUR wedding, not some casual family hangout. All she had to do that day was stand there, be pretty and smile. How disrespectful of her! Nta.", "Lol NTA.\n\nYour mom sucks though.", "NTA. But you should have never allowed them to turn your big day into a \"dry\" snooze fest. Those are the fuking worst. I would have done a shot right in your sils face.

Not the rest\n of society around you.", "I do not think you needed to add curse words to get your message across, nor do I think you were an AH to serve alcohol at your wedding.

If your SIL is incapable of controlling herself then she needs to remove herself from the situation, not demand other people adjust everything to their needs/wants. If your mother wants to police what happens in her own home, or at an event being held *for* her or SIL then that\u2019s her right. It is *not* her right to police other peoples lives- ESPECIALLY on their WEDDING day.", "NTA it's your day you accommodated her for part of the day she should've left with the kids", "I have two sisters and a mom who are alcoholics and they refuse any help, so at my wedding we had an open bar and someone assigned to watch them and remove them if they caused trouble.  You can't live your life around people who don't want help.  In your case, why ruin a good evening for the problem one person has?  NTAH.", "NTA.\n\nRemind your mum that if she wants SIL to be successful, she needs to be able to be present and sober when others are drinking at functions/events/weddings. If she is unable to, then it is up to SIL to remover herself from the situation, not on everyone else to cater to her.", "NTA but you probably should had flat out told mom the plan instead of keeping it a secret until it happened. SIL's sobriety is up to her to control.", "NTA but I would go NC with anyone who screamed at me (especially on my fucking wedding day) for at least a year. Tell your brother you need space from his out of control wife. Tell your mom to stay out of it or join the blocked list. \n\nI\u2019m serious go NC for a year and see how much better, calmer, less stressful your life is. Then decide how much contact you want to have with them. There is a reason I\u2019m LC with my dad & wont spend any holiday with him. I get to enjoy the holidays now instead of being stressed out and miserable.", "NTA. \n\nHer drinking problem is not everyone\u2019s drinking problem.", "NTA.

Your SIL should have just left with her kids.", "Nta", "I am a recovered alcoholic, and I would never ever stop someone from drinking. ESPECIALLY on their wedding day.\nNta, congrats.", "NTA - if SIL has a drink problem then it seems to me you\u2019ve done everything you can to accommodate. Kept it dry for a certain period then notify when it\u2019s not going to be. If she\u2019s serious about addressing her problem then she can leave then. Where\u2019s your brother in all this\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s also this weird stance some parents have that their child\u2019s wedding day is actually for them and they get to make key decisions/inviting certain guests. It\u2019s your day regardless of if their paying all or some of the bill.", "So it sounds like your family gives you shit no matter what. You allow or serve alcohol? Your mother's upset. You don't serve alcohol? Your SIL throws a fit.\n\nNTA. Your family has issues but that's not your fault.", "As a recovering alcoholic, 100% NTA. If *i* dont feel like i can be around alcohol, its on me to remove myself from the situation. My disease (and it IS a disease) is on me to manage. I would never expect anyone to cater to me. I hope you had an awesome wedding outside of this shit!", "NTA\n\nYou are not responiable for her. If she has a drinking problem, then she should not drink. If she can't be around people who drink, than she needs to leave at 730 like those under 21. \n\nHer issue, so she needs to change her life and make her choices based on her needs, and not expect everyone else to change for her.", ">Today is my fucking day.\n\nWhat about... you know... your husband? It's his day as well.\nHow does he feel when you speak about his sister like that?", "Love the statement \u201cim responsible for my own sobriety\u201d! I find that only us who have really dealt with being sober can make that statement. Theres a whole difference between being physically sober and emotionally/mentally sober - and this is a key point.", "By the time I swore, it was 8 pm ish and I have been up for over 24 hours and just sick of SIL theatrics. It was my breaking point.", "It was on the invitation. Everyone knew ahead of time. Anyone 20 and under were to leave by 730 as alcohol was being brought out by 8 pm.  So mom knew as did SIL. It wasn't a secret", "Well NTA and tell your mom SIL needs to remove herself/take measures if something triggers her. It's HER responsibility to deal with her triggers the world doesn't stop for her.", "So weird... I married into a large Irish Catholic family and had our wedding on a Friday. Our guests were already drinking on the steps of the church immediately after the ceremony lol. The whole night turned into a grand, fun, shit show by the time it ended at 12am. We did take care to have multiple shuttles paid for to transport our guests, but that poor Hotel bar tender when we showed up lol. He got a more then generous tip and wasn't annoyed because everyone was being celebratory and there were no issues, but most weddings I go to are like that. And yes there were alcoholic who couldn't drink, my dad being one of them, but he was perfectly fine and just laughed and said man if this party happened 30 years ago... it's not your responsibility to cater to someone else's addiction (aside from like don't pressure them to do something or guilt trip them into doing something)", "Your SIL will not be a success until she learns to function successfully in society as it is, rather than have society function around her.\n\nYour mother needs to understand that if she wants to help your SIL she needs to help her learn to adapt to the situations she finds herself in. That might mean leaving of she becomes too uncomfortable. It might mean not attending at all if she can't cope with the event. It might mean asking someone she trusts to stay sober with her. It does not mean bullying the guest of honour into changing their entire event to accommodate her.", "Does your mum have Rescue Ranger/Florence Nightingale tendencies?", "Probably not, but she's going about it the wrong way.", "> My mom is the same way, and I'm the \"success\" who evidently isn't allowed to set any boundaries my sister doesn't like or else I'm \"being mean\".
