I didn't consent to that and said as much.\n\nI'm confused. Was mom paying for the wedding? What did you \"not consent\" to? That she wouldn't pay for an open bar?\n\nThis sounds like a BYOB type event. I have never attended such a wedding in the US. Not putting it down, just curious.", "NTA - they literally teach you on AA that your addiction is yours to manage and no one else\u2019s responsibility. If your mom was truly an advocate she\u2019d see your SIL as a multifaceted human who is not defined by her struggles. Your mom is not helping her by asking the world to over accommodate or refusing to see her outside of her addiction. Your mom means well but is insanely out of her depth and out of line. \n\nCongrats on your nuptials. I hope you got lit and laid on your wedding night \ud83e\udd23", "NTA.\n\nThat is some entitlement by mom to require your reception to be dry to cater to SIL.  Your SIL needs to be able to co-exist in a room with people drinking or leave.  It is difficult to require everyone around you to not drink because you are an alcoholic.", "NTA\n\nSIL and mom are assholes. You have no obligation to make your event dry because your SIL has a drinking problem. (Sounds like that's the least of her problems, TBH.)\n\nYou SHOULD have addressed it when mom first talked about making it dry. Might have avoided some drama. But that's minor on the scale of things.", "Nta. Did your mom pay for the wedding? Is that why she got to decide it would be dry? You should have had security escort your SIL out.", "NTA.\n\nI'd have said no from the start, let the drinking begin when guests arrive.  Her being an alcoholic is her issue, not yours.  Either she can control herself or she can not be places where it's around.  And after screaming at you once I'm shocked you didn't have her ejected on her ass.", "NTA It's your wedding, not SIL's. I don't understand why anyone would expect the bride or groom to cater to anyone of any \"special needs\". It's like throwing a barbecue, but without meat, because someone is bringing a vegan as a plus-one. It's just so wrong to mess it up for everybody else for the sake of just one person.", "I\u2019m a recovered alcoholic and though weddings were tough for me in the beginning, alcohol is literally EVERYWHERE. Gas stations. Grocery stores. Restaurants. If she\u2019s tempted to drink at your wedding she\u2019ll be tempted elsewhere. It\u2019s not up to you or your family to manage her problem. That\u2019s codependency. She needs to know what she is okay with being around, and if she doesn\u2019t want to be around alcohol she can leave. I\u2019m queen of the 9pm / Irish exit because usually if people are drinking, by 9pm that\u2019s when people get rowdy haha. NTA", "NTA.  Your wedding your rules.  Your SIL is responsible for her own issue and controlling that issue.  It was never your mothers place to decide it was going to be a dry wedding.", "NTA. Your day your wedding.", "NTA ... unless SIL never leaves her home alcohol exists. Restaurant alcohol Hotels alcohol. She needs to deal with it. Just say No!!", "NTA. You were super  kind by still inviting your Sil, because honestly, you could have excluded her all together", "NTA If she can't be around alcohol, it isn't the world that needs to remove it for her. She needs to remove herself from it.", "NTA her alcoholism isn't your problem. And ngl your mom sucks. Please grow a spine and shut her down next time. Just because your SIL can't handle her shit doesn't mean the world has to cater to her - and I say that as an alcoholic in recovery (6 years sober and counting).", "NTA. You are not responsible for other\u2019s substance abuse problems. Alcohol is around her everywhere\u2014restaurants, grocery stores, etc. She needs to deal with it herself, and if she can\u2019t, take herself out of that situation", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had my niece nephew and my husband's niece and nephew in the wedding. My family...mom, dad, brother, niece, nephew, and SIL flew in from where they live. My SIL and I have never really gotten along, I don't know why, we just haven't. My mother who is amazing has decided that my wedding was going to be a dry wedding.

My mom was an alcoholic and while we tried to make things as easy as possible for her it wasn't our job to keep alcohol away from her. Sometimes temptation is there and it just has to be faced.", "NTA. It\u2019s your SIL\u2019s responsibility to be in charge of her sobriety. You were gracious enough to have a partially dry wedding and made it clear what time that would change. Your mother coddling SIL is not helping anyone.", "Ugh, family drama. You're not the asshole for wanting to have a good time at your own wedding. SIL needs to chill and get her shit together. But maybe next time don't let mom make all the decisions, ya know?", "NTA", "NTA. people are responsible for how they handle/manage their triggers. while it\u2019s kind to be considerate to someone\u2019s situation, ultimately it\u2019s that person\u2019s responsibility. the SIL is throwing a hissy fit because everyone isn\u2019t catering to her on OP\u2019s wedding day of all days. if the SIL has that bad of a problem around alcohol that even being at the same place where some people are drinking might cause a problem for her then maybe she should get some help like an in patient program or something.", "NTA. It's up to SIL to manage her alcoholism or not. You shouldn't be expected to have a dry wedding for her benefit", "NTA, she can leave with the under 21 and take your mother with her.", "And take OP's mom with her", "It was an outdoor BYOB event. I love my mom to pieces, but she is really overprotective of my SIL because she had a lot of struggles in life that I didn't. Yes my Mom and Dad helped pay for my wedding.", "Lol I will admit at that point I grabbed my best friend who was my MOH and we got hammered. My husband opted to have a small drink and we don't talk about the poor hotel room lol.", "Yeah like in the first few months of sobriety it makes sense to avoid being around alcohol especially in conjunction with stressful events (which wedding are for some people, and it makes sense for people in your life to help facilitate that during that period. But that facilitation applies to not having alcohol at family dinners, not your SILs wedding.", "And Al-Anon teaches that we can't love someone sober.", "Mom knew, she just \"forgot\".", "I was trying not to ruin anyone's good time or make anyone uncomfortable. My mom was trying to \"pretend there is no alcohol so there shall not be any\". It was right in the invitation I made that specifically said 20 and under need to be out by 730 as alcohol will be allowed at 8. It was bold face font. You couldn't miss it.", "Well, you are NTA, but something is weird about this. I've never heard of a mom prioritizing a daughter-in-law's substance problems over a daughter's wedding wishes.", "Dead as hell \ud83d\udc80\ud83e\udd23 good for you!", "Hah. Yeah, I saw your additional post down below about it being prominent on the invitations.\n\nYou handled everything right - sorry your SIL and mom were jerks about it.\n\nHave a great life!", "My mom views me as a success. SIL not so much so in order to help make her a success everyone around SIL must cater to the needs no matter how outrageous. SIL could have left for the hotel I paid for but she stuck around. She had options and decided to not use them. Ever since my brother met this chic my mom had always taken her side, no matter how ridiculous the argument.", "Mom probably doesn\u2019t want SIL to relapse and for it to affect her son/grandkids", "I feel you.  Mom's an enabler who is addicted to being the \"fixer\"/\"hero\".  SIL showed up with all sorts of problems, and mom was the hero who helped get her through those.  She got addicted to her role as being the one to save SIL from herself/her problems, and now, that's her main goal.  Mom will stomp any boundary or bully any person, including her own daughter, if it means she can \"fix\" things for SIL.  In her mind, it's *right* what she's doing because poor SIL had a tough life/has a disease/can't help herself, and you OP had a good life and just *want* alcohol at your reception, so surely SIL has the greater need and should be sided with!  And it just so happens this would make mom the hero again, how convenient.  \n\nOn the flip side, if she goes against SIL, then she's not just no longer the hero/fixer, but the villain who is telling SIL no.  And we can't have that.  \n\nMy mom is the same way, and I'm the \"success\" who evidently isn't allowed to set any boundaries my sister doesn't like or else I'm \"being mean\".  But my sister can act however she wants and we just have to \"be understanding\" because \"she has issues that make it hard for her that we could never understand\".", "I sounds like it\u2019s because brother is The Golden Boy - she\u2019s prioritizing his Happy Family over  her daughter. Because she\u2019s \u201calready a success\u201d?? BS - she\u2019s catering to her baby boy. NTA congrats on the marriage!! Go NC with drunken witch SIL & poor lil golden boy brother. LC for mommy dearest.", "Ah, well, I'm glad you didn't cave to her demands. Time for SIL to start wearing big-girl-pants and Mom to stop coddling her.", "[deleted]", "Oh now I get it.  I was thinking SIL was her new husband's sister and not her brothers wife!  That makes much more sense.", "She just hates me for some reason. She was more mad that she wasn't allowed to control everything. She hates that I'm close with the above mentioned people, especially my niece."]}
