You are doing the right thing by not saying anything.", "NTA. Is your gf wearing a bra home? Are you? It\u2019s weird and not ok to ask a woman to wear one home, where she should be comfy.", "NTA - on the face of it, it sounds like a little insecurity from your gf \u2026 she\u2019s probably\u201csexualising\u201d the lack of bra \u2026 might be worth ask your gf if that\u2019s the problem and if so is there anything, apart from dictating to your friend what to wear, that can improve that insecurity .. do you guys have a date night, once a week or smth?", "NTA. It isn't that difficult to ignore the fact someone isn't wearing a bra. It really isn't that uncommon and it doesn't effect your life in any way. No idea why your GF has a problem with it.", "NTA - You are dating a misogynist. Yes, women can be misogynists too. It's really a shame when other women decide to sexualize and tear down other women for simply having nipples/breasts. If your friend was a plus sized man (therefore having \"man-titties\") would your sexist gf tell him to tuck them behind some underwire and padding? No, she wouldn't. Does she get upset when men and boys are shirtless at the beach and pool? No, she doesn't. Because her issue isn't with possible visible nipples, her issue *IS WITH WOMEN*. Fuck that.", "NTA. She agreed to take her in. Did she think your friend will dress business -casual at home?!", "NTA - You're saving good, hard-working boobs from the tyranny of the bra!", "NTA. You\u2019re right and your GF needs to get to the route of why this bothers her. It comes off like insecurity or jealousy.", "NTA, as you say, we need to stop policing what others wear, full stop. And especially what they wear in the place they are calling home!", "NTA.  Nobody should be forced to wear a bra in their own home, those things are extremely uncomfortable.", "I mean if she's going to be insecure about your roomie, then maybe she shouldn't have agreed to let her live with you both in the first place.\n\nNTA and she is barking in the wrong tree anyways if you really were ogling your roommate.", "NTA Not only should you definitely not ask your friend to start wearing a bra, but your girlfriend shouldn't either. It's extremely weird that she cares. This is your friend's home and she should be free to be comfortable.\nI don't think I know any women who don't immediately take off their bras when they get home.", "NTA, but I feel you will still be punished regardless of whether you are right or not. \u201cYou can be right AND dead\u201d comes to mind.", "NTA. She's imagining jealousy from nothing due to her insecurities. You're never going to hear the end of this though. A way out of this one is tough. You may want to have a household meeting about this to get it out in the open so the two of them can settle it, but you not say anything but makes you look good like you care about each person which you do. Your gf will NEVER BE OPEN ABOUT THIS TO HER, so call the meeting of all 3 of you and dont say what it's about, that way it forces her to get over it. Puts her on the spot. Say you did this because as a household team, you must live together peacefully and have open communication. She literally cant get pissed about that. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WOMEN WOULD SAY. Get her at her own game.\n\nWhat I would do if it were me, id buy a bra, and wear it around the house once just to mess with the gf right in front of the other friend, and be like, \" Ohhhh, I thought you meant you were uncomfortable with ME not wearing a bra, my bad.\" \n\nDon't do that ^.  But it would be funny. Lol.", "NTA. I hate people who feel that they must police other people's lives. Your girlfriend should just police her own behavior.", "NTA\n\nFeminism is clearly foreign to your girlfriend\u2026as is personal comfort, minding her own business and generally being a decent person. They\u2019re just boobs!!!!!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are right. IF your gf craves to be an AH, let HER do it herself.", "Info is not wearing a bra exposing anything?", "While I am also of the mindset it is more socially appealing for a woman to wear a bra, you'll never find me asking her to wear one. Ever. It's her body, she is more than able to make that call and I am more than willing to see past it. I agree with others here-its a bit odd she would want to call this out at home. Maybe a conversation about how okay with her there she actually is is in order, OP.", "YTA. Your GF was nice enough to allow another woman to live with you, but the other woman is clearly making your GF uncomfortable in her own home. You clearly couldn't care less about your GF's feelings. The other woman is a guest. There are certain unspoken rules when you are a guest at someone's home. Even if you sleep naked at your own home, you wouldn't run around your host's house naked, would you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good luck in your healing journey :)", "Started there really. I no longer really cling to the doctrinal basis of Christianity, choosing instead to be non-religious. I try to keep an open mind, because I believe religion makes not the person, so why judge them based on their beliefs? People are inherently beautiful, we just cloud over that beauty sometimes. It just takes the right person to help them see it. As such my drive to be a good person isn't religiously motivated, but simply that: **to be a good fucking person.** I really don't think someone needs any more reason than that."]}
