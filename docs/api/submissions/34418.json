We broke up mostly due to his family and had LC for almost ten years. When the pandemic hit we reconnected and last year moved in together in a city close to his hometown (like 3h away). We both work from home, this city is LCL and we have a 3 bedroom house, so we can have a office for each. \n\nHis family is awful. When we were in uni he shared a flat with his friends but eventually had to leave because of his mom She had a key and went there EVERY day with food and clean clothes. Whenever i visited i locked the door because she barged in announced. One day we were being intimate and she pounded on the door until we opened. I argued with her, asked her to call first, she laugh and said she was modern (along with other things i don't remember but were nasty) and called me a tr@mp (first time i heard that name btw). I was fed up with her insults at this point and some other ugly things that happened before so i said sone bad things as well. His dad and sister (SIL) were also calling constantly and dropping by and SIL even stole money and crashed bill's car.\n\nWe got together again because bill explicitly told me he was almost NC with them. They begged for us to spend xmas with them saying they are old etc. In the end we agreed to spend c.eve with them. They live about 3 hours away so i drove there and bill back, i refuse to stay overnight. All was well at first then MIL said SIL is coming back from abroad with her 2kids and new bf and she should stay with us. It was a really bad fight namely because the house we live in, we say our house but i own it. He gave all his savings to his parents the year before we got back together to solve a problem his parents had(won't go into that) and i make a lot more than him. So he pays half the mortgage and utilities but the name on the deed and loan is mine. I suggested she rented a flat but mil said she needed to save (so i guess they assumed they could live here for free).I said no way his toxic sister, 2kids and a guy i don't know would move in. His mom flipped, said we have the space and live in the city so its better for sil, they are old and need \"peace and quiet\"(!?). My bf was quiet the entier time and i was furious. We left, argued a lot but bill said he agreed. 2 days ago he tells me his sis will arrive on the 19th and we should consider letting her stay for a month or 2. Needless to say we argue till morking. I had to go to the office yesterday and when i arrived he had a sofa bed in his office. I mean wtf? He said its his house too and i said i was clear from the start, i wanted NC with inlaws and so did he. \n\nThis is were i may be the ah. I was so mad i printed a standard eviction note giving him 30 days to leave. I was signing it, he came into my office... He left to a friends house, hasn't call and i cried myself to exaustion. I love him, he is so kind, funny and sweet. But i can't live with them.

Your kind and sweet and funny *boyfriend* was going to let his toxic relatives move in with you with no end in sight. F that. \n\nNTA You did what you had to do. I am sorry your BF couldn\u2019t say no, and you could have avoided all this.", "Soft NTA. It\u2019s possible you could have handled this better, but you are _definitely_ not the asshole for insisting that his sister and her family cannot come live with y\u2019all, and that if Bill can\u2019t get his head around that, you\u2019re ready for him to leave too.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Bill was raised in a toxic environment and is unable to say no to his family. And that when push comes to shove, he\u2019ll prioritize their needs/wants over yours (and his!) every time.\n\nWithout knowing how all of your fights/discussions with Bill went, I\u2019ll leave open the possibility that, before the eviction note, you could have had at least one more conversation with him, where you calmly but firmly told him that you will not be living with any of his family, ever, and if that means not living with him either, so be it.\n\nBut I\u2019d also believe it if you told us you\u2019ve done that already.\n\nSo sorry you\u2019re going through this! Don\u2019t cave.", "Sad as it may be, you did the right call. Bill will not be able to stand up to his awful family in the foreseeable future. For some reason, they pull strings that have an effect of him.\n\nHe may be kind, funny and sweet and you obviously love him, but he come with a baggage from which he cannot disentangle and which risks spilling toxic fumes over your life.\n\nNTA and time to take care of yourself.", "Nta - I know you are upset with Bill and you prioritized your peace after he violated your one boundary.  He can\u2019t be inviting people to your house when you said no so he can go kick rocks", "nta your bf has not changed. you have the same problems you had in uni. it hurts but he needs to move out. If you can get counseling to help you unpack all this.", "NTA don't marry into this family. Run girl run!!", "Well, this one went from zero to a billion real quick. It\u2019s sad that he couldn\u2019t accept your one boundary, and that it came to this. Hopefully he\u2019ll come back and apologize and NEVER mention it again. I\u2019m not going to cheerlead such a tragic situation, but definitely NTA.", "NTA Allowing her and her family to live in your house requires two yes votes and one no vote. He knew that his family was a dealbreaker. He's been no contact. Suddenly he wants you to allow his sister and her family to live with you without at the minimum and apology and without a serious set of house rules? Not to mention rent? No. Just no. You did exactly the right thing. This is a hill to die on.", "NTA Bill needs to learn the hard way that his family will continue to be his downfall until he learns to put in place real boundaries. \n\nHe should have immediately shut down the suggestion of SIL moving in and it\u2019s also a major warning sign that he gave away his entire savings to parents he\u2019s apparently not in contact with. \n\nIt sounds like he tried to set boundaries but can\u2019t follow through, and until he can do that, he\u2019s sadly not worth the stress of it all.", "NTA.  It is clear one or both of you need to move.  Since he is the one causing the problem, he is the one who should move.", "NTA. You have always made it clear that you don't want a relationship with his family. As much as its his home, its your home too. A whole family moving in for 2 Months will be hell! He went against all your feelings on this and ignored you. It's a massive lack of respect on his part. You wanted to date him, not his crazy family. They do have somewhere else to stay. If they want free accommodation, beggars can't be choosers.", "NTA and giving him the eviction notice is what you should have done. Essentially he rents from you. And he expected you to take in these family members (who have treated you horribly in the past) and support them because... what, apparently he does whatever his mother tells him? Doesn't seem like NC to me.", "Is the eviction notice a liiiittle bit petty? Maybe. But this dude earned it. NTA. You own the house, it\u2019s clearly time to break up, and he didn\u2019t respect you at all here (even if you both owned the house he\u2019d still be an asshole for trying to steamroll you like that). So he needs a new place to live. Cut and dry NTA.", "NTA He sounds like a great guy. That doesn't mean you should just let his family move in. I don't think they would ever leave, and it would be terrible for your mental health.", "He is only kind to his mama.\n\nNAT. Cry your eyes out this weekend and set your Tinder profile on Monday. He is never ever going to change. Good luck!", "NTA. You have everything to lose, your boyfriend isn't standing up to his family, and sometimes it takes the nuclear option to either get rid of the problem, or get rid of the people that allow the problem. You may love him, but that doesn't always mean you can be together. If he won't grow a backbone then you'll be dealing with his family for the rest of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
