No problem. However he invited extra ppl and we weren\u2019t aware of the seven extra ppl until the night before. Thankfully, we had enough! So we just went with it. \n\nThese ppl were my FILs aunt and her husband, son and family. We have spent one day with them in 20+ years. Some of them we hadn\u2019t met until a month before. So it was a little awkward due to the lack of familiarity. \n\nMy FILs aunt took over the day and brought photo albums which she forced us to look through for 3+ hours while she told stories. She also went behind me and redid everything I was doing as hostess. When I turned and told her what my plan was and why I was doing it the way I was, she basically told me that didn\u2019t make sense rolled her eyes and walked away. So basically, it was awkward and rude. \n\nThis year we decided to keep it small with just my husbands siblings. And since my FIL would not be able to make it due to living overseas, we saw no issue with not inviting his family. \n\nSide note: my husband and his siblings do not know these ppl well because their dad cut ties with them. \n\nSo this year we planned to go out of state to a brothers house to celebrate. However, one of my husbands cousins (we\u2019ll call him Steve), texted the family group chat to let us know that he was probably going to get off of work for thanksgiving and was planning on going to my FILs aunts house with us. We weren\u2019t planning on going there this year so my husband let them know that we wouldn\u2019t be home on that day due to previous plans but we\u2019d be happy to get together on a different day. His wording was taken as being \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cselfish\u201d because he said \n\n\u201cI think I should clarify that we are just wanting close family for thanksgiving day. \nAnother day may work for everyone else. Also, I think most of us are still planning on  going to Tommy\u2019s for thanksgiving day.\u201d \n\nThe reason that this was stated because Steve and some of my hubby\u2019s sisters were seeming to think that we were offering to host at our house on thanksgiving day. This text was taken to mean that we were just being mean. \n\nAnother side note: my husbands youngest brother drowned last year and so the siblings decided they just wanted to keep it small with just the siblings and their families. \n\nAre we the Asshole for telling them they can\u2019t come? Or are we just setting boundaries by not letting Steve invite themselves and try to change all of our thanksgiving plans?", "created_utc": 1667537601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylp8il/aita_for_telling_my_husbands_family_they_arent/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(I\u2019m confused as to how they thought you were offering to host when his original text was about going to the FIL\u2019s aunt\u2019s house together, though?)\n\nTo avoid conflict, I would have kept things vague in terms of location but firm that you are celebrating with other family this year. For example, \u201c[Husband]\u2019s siblings wanted to celebrate with close family this year after the recent loss of his brother. We aren\u2019t quite sure where we will be celebrating yet but unfortunately won\u2019t be able to come to [FIL Aunt\u2019s].

End of the issue.\n\nJust because it's Thanksgiving - or any other family holiday for that matter - doesn't mean anyone is entitled to receive an invitation. Just as noone should just invite other people - family or not - to someone else's house. And as a guest you don't get to take over the activities or make any changes to anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
