I have two sons from a previous relationship that are 8 and 10. They live with me full time and see their mom every other weekend and half the school holidays. My Fianc\u00e9 has a very good relationship with my boys and has always been there for their big moments (first day of school, soccer games..) .\n\nA few weeks ago we found out that my fianc\u00e9 was pregnant. The timing was really bad as my fianc\u00e9 has been going back to university to study and she would have to give up her big dream. She said that it was a difficult choice, but that she wanted to have an abortion. We cried a lot together, and I also walked in on her a few times crying alone. Just to be clear, I did not pressure her into anything as I was very open that I did want a child with her, but in the timeline she feels most comfortable with.\n\nNow is where apparently I am an asshole: my Fianc\u00e9 had asked me to be there for her in the week after the abortion to help her recover and to give emotional support. She also asked me if I could drop off my boys at their mothers place, because she would like some alone time with me to adjust to the situation and they are on school break anyway. I was not allowed to be there in the hospital the day of the abortion (apparently that is to ensure the women are not pressured) and was supposed to pick her up. But the Mother of my kids called that I had to take the kids because she just broke up with her boyfriend and that she couldn't deal with having them there. I called my fianc\u00e9s parents (they knew, what was going on) to pick her up and I said I would come to her place later (we don't live together). My younger son (8) had a complete breakdown because he saw his mother and her (ex)boyfriend fight and it had apparently been physical. He said he wanted to stay with me instead of me dropping them off at my parents place. I called my fianc\u00e9 and asked her if I could bring the boys, but she refused saying she was not feeling well and having the boys there would be too much for her.  \n\nI couldn't just leave my boys behind, so I told her I would call every day to check on her and that she should call me if she needed anything or if she was ready to have me and the boys there with her.\n\nIt's been a week and I called her every day, but she had been very distant with me.  When I called today she cried and said that she had to endure everything alone and that all she wanted was one week with me to be with her. She assured me that she loves my boys, but that I should have made her a priority this time because the boys had not been in any real emergency but that she had needed me. \n\nShe says she has to rethink our relationship and I am so scared to lose her. I love her with all my heart, but it's not like I could have just left my boys when they clearly needed me too. I know it was hard for her, but I didn't know what else to do, as my sons begged me to stay with them.  \n\nSo, AITA for having prioritized my sons?

You didn't remove them from the situation but instead, stayed with their mum... who was the one traumatising them and putting them in danger? And you admit that grandparents offered multiple times but that you turned them down for \"quality time\" so yes op, YTA. YTA for not actually removing your children from this situation, YTA for playing happy families with your abusive ex while leaving your partner alone for a week physically recovering and shouldering all of the grief that comes with a termination, YTA for not taking the opportunities that you had to be with her. \n\nI N F O: are there any other family members that could have looked after them for a day, not even the whole day necessarily but maybe a few hours, in that whole week? Aunts, uncles, grandparents etc? You mention dropping them off at the parents place and I think it would have been wrong to do that right away but could grandparents not come to yours and take over for a few hours so you could be with your girlfriend? Could they have stayed one night later on the week so you could comfort her?\n\nYour kids are your priority but your GF is not in the wrong for being upset, she went through something very traumatic and needed support. You couldn't offer that support through no fault of your own. I'm leaning towards N A H but it depends on the info above...", "Im going with a soft YTA. You sound like a really great dad and your boys are lucky to have you. Your kids are the main priority, but your fiance is supposed to be a priority too. \n\nYour fiance has just gone through something traumatic and you havent seen her for a week? She's grieving and i think word-word-num said it best \" If your parents had been willing to take the kids in, they would have taken them in for a day/part of a day a few times over the week at least, to free you up to spend some time with your fianc\u00e9.\"   \n\n\nI know you didnt mean to but you really let her down when she really needed you. There could have been better solutions than essentially abandoning your grieving fianc\u00e9 to process this by herself. Trusted friends, grandparents, even someone to watch them partially or for a few hours a day so you could have spent time with her too. Im not suggesting you should have not been with your kids, they needed you. But you could have found ways to spend some time during the week with her.", "Esh. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for being the father your kids need in that traumatic event. I do think you acted like an AH bc you carved absolutely not time to physically make the effort to go see her and be there for her other than a phone call. And that\u2019s what she sees. She sees/ realizes that in her own desperate time of need you made no effort beyond a phone call. \n\nWhether my interpretation is right or wrong since I wasn\u2019t there, I\u2019m not her, nor you. I can only surmise with empathy from my own experiences and knowledge with having a blended family and our priorities. She\u2019s grieving, hurt and sees you didn\u2019t try.\n\nHer validity does not negate your children\u2019s\u2019 needs. I think it was easier for your u to push her to the back burner. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s happened before, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mean to. I\u2019m sure she normally accepts it. This time - she didn\u2019t. For her, this appears be the deal breaker and it could have been prevented", "YTA. I don't believe that you couldn't leave your kids for an entire week to help your fiance through what might have been the most traumatic thing she'll ever go through. \n\nGuess what? That kid was also yours. The fact that you couldn't even carve out a few hours of an entire fucking week is very telling. Any kids you have with her would also probably always be second best, and she can now see that.", "NAH this is the reality of dating someone with kids and she needs to think if she can deal with this. I 100% see her point and my heart breaks for her having to go through that alone. She was abandoned by you. I understand your reasoning and I am not saying you were wrong but I couldn\u2019t imagine how hard that was for her. If I was her I would see the sad reality of the relationship and probably break up so I could heal on my own. Your kids should always come first to you it would just suck having to be the second priority in that situation.", "If it wasn't an abortion procedure but a miscarriage, would you also have spent a week spending quality time with your kids without going to see her? YTA", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds like your kids (or at least one) witnessed something fairly traumatic with his mother and ex having a physical altercation.  Your ex seemed to be in no place to take care of her kids.  Your children needed you.  Your girlfriend needed you.   The timing was unfortunate, but I'd say taking care of the emotional well being of your children was the right choice. \n\nI understand her being hurt.  But if she can't understand prioritizing your children, maybe she isn't really ready to be a parent.", "You deserve to be broken up with and she deserves better. \n\nShe absolutely made the right decision not to give up her dreams for an asshole like you who will not even make a genuine effort to be with her through her trauma. \n\nSicko.", "NTA. I get where she is coming from, that is an upsetting experience, however your boys come first. They weren\u2019t in a real emergency? Ummm their mother was in a physical fight with a ex and that isn\u2019t an emergency? If my children were in a situation that got physical in front of my kids I\u2019d drop everything to remove my children from that situation. Although emotional and upset she could\u2019ve compromised by staying with you for the week, am I weird or is this a new thing where people no longer live together in long term relationships?", "NTA. Your children must always come first. There is nothing you could have done you cannot legally force their mother to take the children if it is not her court appointed time. And honestly if your fiance cannot understand that then honestly she's probably not the woman for you. Because she's not thinking about your children, I mean she didn't even want her own child so that should tell you plenty about her.", "YTA. \n\nWhy did it have to be all or nothing?\n\nYour kids would not have been so needy that you couldn\u2019t organise child care for them some or most of those days. \n\nIf it had been a school week, were they really so traumatised from seeing an argument that you would have kept them out from school and not gone to work all week?\n\nOr would it have been perfectly ok to send them to school and make sure they had comfort & dad time after school\u2026?  In which case you could have organised for significant \u201cchunks\u201d of time for supporting your fianc\u00e9. \n\nShe is right to be questioning the relationship. \n\nWhat if she had miscarried or had a premature delivery with baby in the NICU\u2026? And this same scenario happened at that point. Would you have left her to cope alone with all of that because your older children are more important?  Or would the live baby have trumped the live older children. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 just lost a baby. Ok by (difficult) choice, but she LOST A BABY. \n\nYour baby!\n\nShe is right to have wanted and expected your support.", "NTA, Your kids didn't choose to be traumatised by their mother and her ex. Your first priority should be your kids.", "NTA. You would have been if you left your 8 year old son while he was having a breakdown having witnessed something traumatic.", "YTA...you had a week to make this right, but spent the entire time with your kids. I get that you were a parent first, but you abandoned your fianc\u00e9e at what may have been the most traumatic point in her life.", ">I love her with all my heart\n\nNo, you don't. There's no fucking way, you couldn't visit her alone ONCE during the whole week. You just didn't want to. I bet that if she decided to go with the pregnancy, you would do exactly the same shit, when she needs you the most. She deserves way more than this.\n\nYTA", "NTA...you need to put the children first. Your boys needed you after seing their mother been physical with her bf. Your gf had her parents to be with her. She needs to understand that children will come first always. In the future if you decided to have another child with her, you will protect that child like you protect the others kids. She needs to heal and she is sensible now. Visit her with the children and make each one bring her flowers and chocolats. Show her that your kids love her too and you are all a family.", "Im going to go with YTA. You definitely should have been there for her and showed up at least a few times to provide emotional support, without the children. You\u2019re telling me you had to spend every minute in the house and not provide your partner with an hour of support a day without children?! She just had an emotional medical procedure, and you couldn\u2019t afford her an hour a day?! If you really care about her, you would have cared enough to show up. You called her? What is this a long distance engagement?! I wouldn\u2019t marry you after this\u2026 it\u2019s one thing to prioritize your children and another to completely neglect your partner during her time of need and support. Also, why doesn\u2019t she live with you?", "A full week of child priorisation is too much. At least some effort should have been made to get to her and give support for some part of that. A human to human gesture was needed, and you fell down.. both in action and her estimation.", "NAH. She's entitled to feel hurt and alone. But given the option between taking care of your children, who were traumatized, and an adult, who had to make a tough choice but also had other support available to take care of her after her procedure... you did what you needed to do. Tough call, and maybe you want to offer to take her on a mini vacation or something to have some time to yourselves, if that's possible. And should you be able to mend things, maybe double up on your birth control methods so this doesn't happen again.\n\nETA. I think you probably could've left the boys with your parents for an afternoon to go see her. Maybe you should ask yourself why you didn't do that.", "YTA. You had to see to your kids first if your little one was being traumatized, but why did you stay away from your fiancee the entire week?", "Ah there is no winning here is there?\n\nCould you have brought your sons to your parents, or a sibling or trusted friend, and go back and forth between them and your fiancee?", "Yes, YTA but I understand.  This is a tough situation, but you told her you would come over, and then you didn\u2019t.  Unless your 8 yr old was glued to your hip, you needed to show up for your partner for at least a little while.  Have the kids go to a movie with their grandparents, ask their friends\u2019 parents if they can play together for an afternoon, something.\nCalling doesn\u2019t cut it.  She needed you there to hug and hold and to cry together.  I get why you chose what you did, but at some point in the week you needed to be with her.  I would rethink the relationship too.", "NTA! Your first duty to others is to care for your kids - they CAN'T be left alone! You could've talked more with fianc\u00e9e and after 24 hrs asked kiddos if you could take them to your mom's house for a day or 2. You got caught  between a rock and a hard place with both women unable to care for the kids. There's no great choices here but to do the best you can and it's clear you tried.", "With all that you have detailed in the comments 100% YTA.\n\nYou priority is correct but you could have handled it better with not catering that much to your ex and taking help from grandparents.\nYou did the outings and had a quality time in the time when someone you love and want to spend the rest of your life with was recovering from the death of your unborn child and desperately needed you there.\n\nDo you resent her for this choice maybe? That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t make any effort and was hiding all week?\n\nAnyway If I would be her, I think I\u2019d end things with you. Your boys are old enough for you to sit them down and explain that you need to be elsewhere for few hours and this is important. This is a complete description not sure you can fix that.", "As a parent, you are NTA ... your kids were there before her and will be there afterwards. This is why I'm not looking to date any guys that don't want to date guys who don't want kids or don't have any. She chose that abortion, you didn't. She's putting her feelings of pain on you. Im not a pro life fanatic but I believe in many decisions before coming to that one. If you said that you wanted the baby and she didn't,  she made her choice and shouldn't be upset with you.", "NTA. You have been clear your kids will always be a priority and come first and so they should. It\u2019s what you get into when you date someone with kids. She went through something painful sure and that\u2019s sad but you called and tried to be there.

Like yeah the timing sucks but like from her perspective what were you SUPPOSED to do?\n\n did she want you to abandon THEM ?\n\nShe's an adult with a whole support system including you and your kids are reliant on you and their mum and are not adults with a whole support system they can independently access unlike her\n\nAgain it's a shit situation for her emotionally obviously but also she's not the only one in the world going through trauma and you have a responsibility to your children", "N a h for the situation of choosing your boys on the day but YTA for everything that followed. You seriously couldn\u2019t find a couple of hours the entire week? When the kids were in school or bed? Not one hour? I\u2019m not surprised she\u2019s leaving you. She has every right to feel abandoned because she was, you had a reason for it but you still abandoned her in an extremely vulnerable time. She has the right to find a partner who will prioritise her at her most vulnerable instead of running your kids to see their abusive mother every day. You children witness their mother abuse her boyfriend and you still took them round every day, why? Why are you letting a violent woman around your children? If it was the other way round and the kids had witness a man getting violent with their mother would you let them anywhere near him? \nYou even state you had offers from grandparents but you didn\u2019t want to take one day not running them back and forth. It was a difficult and stressful time I get that, but you refused to even try to be with her during the whole week. \n\nBottom line is you chose to ferry your children to a violent woman every day for a week instead of trying to find an hour to be with your vulnerable fianc\u00e9.", "I'm going with YTA for what you did to her. Your kids are important and you did right by them, but in doing so, you threw your fiance right under the bus. You could have taken a day an afternoon or a an hour or so to go visit her. You did no such thing. Calling is like applying a bandage to a torn limb. Many women suffer much more after the fact, especially if they love children. She had to go through the process on her own due to restriction and that sucked, but then she was left with phisical consequences and psychological torment with 0 help from her partner. I see her point of wanting to reconsider your relationship.", "YTA y didn't see her for a whole week and yre chocked she has been distant oh wow !! I wish she leaves you", "NTA, kids are your priority. But I hope your fianc\u00e9e opens her eyes to the reality that you gave her zero support at a really bad time in her life and dumps you. She deserves better.", "NTA. Your kids were subjecting to seeing their mum physically abused. To me, their emotional support was more important than someone who underwent a procedure they decided to. I understand having an abortion can be emotional, but it's not a surprise trauma. You have time to prepare. She is a grown woman who also had others available to support her. Your kids are young and they weren't expecting to go through this. They needed you.", "YTA. You were not happy with the abortion and used your boys as an excuse to stay away when it\u2019s clear you could have visited. You are the AH both to your kids for using them like that and to your fianc\u00e9e for leaving her with no support. I hope she dumps you.", "YTA, you didn\u2019t see her a whole week. She was on her own a whole week\u2026 the kids couldn\u2019t be away from you for even part of a day???", "I love how you conveniently forgot to write in the main post that your ex was the one beating her new partner, and that you spent all week with her and the children. You also forgot to mention that her parents offered to take care of the children for a few hours, but you refused and had outings with her for the whole week.\n\nYTA, you cannot care less about your (hopefully for her) EX fianc\u00e8.", "You were in a no win situation.

Unfair or not, parenting responsibilities don't just stop because you had a fight, or because you have a physically and mentally hard medical procedure. Your boys must come first when it comes to emotional needs; they are children, the women are adults. \n\nThat being said, you should be able to get away with your fiancee from time to time and your fiancee has every right to feel hurt that you couldn't make it to her for even a few hours during this week. What would your ex have done if you'd been out of state, or out of country? What other options did you have to step in just for a couple of hours during the week: babysitter, her parents, other close friends or family, one of their (the kids) friends' houses?\n\nNot going to call anyone the AH as it's just a crap situation all the way around. I hope you and your fiancee can work through it and that your ex finds herself in a safer, healthier relationship going forward.", "YTA\n\nNot for prioritising your kids, because they should always be number 1, but for not seeing your fianc\u00e9 at all for the whole week.\n\nYou could have, at the very least, spent a few hours each day with her and picked her up from the appointment, and spent that day with her", "Yeah yta, takes two to get pregnant.", "YTA.  I was all set to say you weren\u2019t the asshole but then I read about your 8 year old deciding he wanted to go with you instead of staying with the grandparents for a bit.  So then you asked fianc\u00e9 if they could both come over with you knowing she needed that time alone with you.  When did 8 year olds get to decide these things.  You could have left them for a few hours to spend that time with fianc\u00e9.  You really failed her the whole week.  \n\nI do think kids come first.  I just don\u2019t think you couldn\u2019t find a little time to spend with your fianc\u00e9.  Did you agree with the abortion?  Because it really sounds like you were punishing her.

A week and you couldn't organise a playdate or time with grandparents to go comfort her for a few hours?! I'm sure the kids would have loved to go to the cinema with their grandparents a few days after the shock at their Mums house or go to an activity centre with friends. Even though it was a choice it can be equally traumatic and painful. She needed you to show her you cared about her more than a phone call once a day! You had plenty of options to still support your children through a tough time and set time aside for her, but you didn't. I am guessing she has had conflicting responsibilities and pressures in the past, but she has negotiated her days to fit it yours and your children's needs. You showed her that you can't keep all the balls in their air when juggling life gets hard. How would she trust you in the future to keep it together if you have another child, or she has medical issues, or she goes through grief? You'd just make sure you call once a day and she should be grateful? I really wouldn't be surprised if she left you and I don't blame her one bit.", "NTA.  Your children are your priority, especially when one of them has been traumatised by his other parent and her ex bf.  Yes going through an abortion is difficult, but the decision was hers.  You cannot abandon your children who live with you full time, so her even asking that you send them away for a week is not really acceptable.  And as they are on school break I am thinking they are home all day at the moment, they are not old enough to be left alone.  It sounds like this could become an ongoing issue that she will have regarding prioritising your children, once you live together if she's studying for exams will she expect you to send them away, if she's sick will she expect you to send them away, if you do have a child later together will she expect you to send them away, that's not really how it works when you are planning on being a step parent.  You should also be having a serious think about your relationship and if she will be the right person to have in your son's lives going forward.", "NTA because your job IS to put your children first, and at the most basic level keep them safe which it sounds like they weren\u2019t safe with their mother. Fianc\u00e9 needs to know that this is what she\u2019s signing up with being with you and maybe that\u2019s not good enough for her. That being said, did you send flowers or a treat? Did you drop off treats at the door for her with a handwritten card? Did you hire a babysitter for an afternoon so you could be with her? Sounds like you were overwhelmed and truly couldn\u2019t win but perhaps on reflecting didn\u2019t do as much as you could have from afar. You may love her with all your heart but if she\u2019s needing to be number 1 in someone\u2019s life who already has two kids she probably should look elsewhere.", "NTA. You absolutely did the right thing as a father and you should not feel guilty about it in the slightest. Taking care of those boys should come before any and everything no matter what, and she should be well aware of that fact. You two definitely should have come up with some sort of compromise if she wanted you there so badly. I do understand why she would be feeling hurt right now but if this is grounds for her to leave you then honestly you are better off without her, which im sure is a painful thought that you may not want to hear. Im sorry you are dealing with such a treacherous situation. I will pray for you and i wish you all the luck in the world. Above everything though, coming from someone who dealt with a LOT of trauma and had a shitty abusive father growing up, thank you for being a good dad to your boys. You did good", "YTA.

I didn't think I was distant on the phone. I was IN PAIN though. I did ask him to just come by an hour or two without the boys on the third day, but he couldnt because they had a Jurassic World Marathon (that's what he told me).\n3.

She should abort him from her life next.", "I agree that his kids should come first, I did say that in my original comment.\n\nWhat makes him the AH is not visiting her in person at all for that week, which he could have done even while looking after his children. Even just a few hours a day", "come over with the boys, Ishe needed also a physical recovery thus calm and quiet as well as emotional thus crying and such ( I believe she would try to hold back on the crying for the boys not to see) ...how would he help her by coming with the kids. Also, I think seeing kids immediately after abortion does no good to one's psyche....\n\nJust saying she did not refuse OP as in himself, but the additional stress he asked to add. HE could;ve spared few hours in that week to come alone", "I am \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI always tell the truth. I always am one of the only ones willing to do so. OP can do what he wants with it.", "he was there for a week. he couldn\u2019t have left for an hour or two while the kids were playing games after the third day?", "OP said ic comments he had no time cause he was driving them to their mother's house every day and that they had an outing together with the Ex ( who beat her BFand OP while they were still together) , then he also clarified that her parents offered to help with the boys but he refused as they already had their outing planned with the EX every day/time they offered and he could not cancel", "I didn\u2019t mean like they sit round doing nothing (guess I have a better relationship with mine that I forget not all is equal when you need a hand) he could of asked a friend or anyone he\u2019s close to he could of put any amount of effort if he honestly wanted to see her he would\nLike he wrote he stayed with them they visited their mother.  Could he not slip away then", "she's seeing her kids only every other weekend and she can't handle even one week in full. If she has kids she is also responsible for the people/environment she's exposing them to, so she has no business living with someone abusive.\n\nhaaah sorry for being prickly, I am just personally fed up with parents who would bring home just about anyone in the name of their \"love life\" for the kids to see. You should make damn sure the person is suitable to meet your children and even then be sure to be able to manage on your own should something go wrong. That should be the responsibility of a single parent, OPs apparently going about it very carefully so it's a pity his Ex wife could not.", "actually, my Ex was the one hitting her partner. That's also why she and I broke up and why I have custody of the kids.", "well I hoped OP made sure to let the kids know their mother's okay. Then again if it was a school year would OP take them from school/himself from work for a whole week ?", "Quality time? That\u2019s fantastic, but you also live with them. And couldn\u2019t anyone take the kids to moms and make the drive a single time so you could go see your fianc\u00e9e? You sound like a great dad but a terrible partner, and that\u2019s okay. Maybe you don\u2019t have time to be both right now and that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t deny that you could\u2019ve tried something else.", "I don't understand why you couldn't carve out 1 hour each day to go and visit your fiance in person, even if you did have all this other stuff to do?", "INFO, again: Was there a reason grandparents/another relative/friend couldn\u2019t have stepped in with driving responsibilities? Was there a reason you couldn\u2019t have visited your fianc\u00e9 when your children were with their mother?", "She's the one who is acting like he shouldn't care about his traumatized child. She's an adult. She can handle her own shit.", "Hahaha \"she chose this\" and there it is, the idea that she deserves less sympathy because of the abortion that HIS EJACULATION caused her to have. \n\nWhen you make people pregnant, that's still your responsibility, no matter what she chooses.", "And it sounds like she was alone at her apartment. Her parents picked her up but it doesn\u2019t sound like they stayed. I don\u2019t know what the solution was, but recovering from an emotional medical procedure alone when you thought your would have support does suck.", "How do you not see that you are being an insensitive AH?? Those kids didnt choose to be put through that traumatizing experience but she did actively choose to have that abortion. She didnt have any reason to do that other than the fact that she valued making her schooling a little easier more than having that baby. His kids will always come before her no matter what 100% of the time, as they goddamn well should. She should wrap her head around that concept if she wants to be with someone with children", "Yes. I am the psycho here.", "I'm sure it wouldnt have helped her at all for him to come with the kids, which is why I said her decision to tell him not to come was totally understandable. \n\nI suppose I just think an 8 year old who watched his mom get beat up is probably more traumatized than a grown woman in her 30's who got an abortion because university is more important to her. \n\nIs she going thru an extremely rough time and does she deserve to be supported? absolutely! But OP isnt the asshole for prioritizing his kids who arrnt as equipped to deal with traumatic experiences, be for real", "*your* truth, not the *actual* truth. This is your interpretation based on one internet post. You know nothing about this woman or her side of the story and you jump to breaking up what otherwise seems like a happy couple. That\u2019s not truth, that\u2019s just\u2026.sad.", "It sounds like he didn't want to leave the kids alone with their mother (which to me says something pretty serious). \n\nBut I guess this is my thought.  Their kids just saw their mother in a new light in beating on some guy.  They felt some type of way, and wanted to be around their dad.  Do I think a week seems like a lot?  Yes.  I also have never been in that situation, nor am I a therapist who is remotely qualified to decide what a \"healthy\" response to that looks like.  \n\nWe also don't know the availability of other people in OPs life.  His parents may not just be free to drop everything and come sit and his place with sleeping kids.  His friends may not want to/be available to do it.  \n\nI feel like people are being too harsh on him.  It doesn't sound like he didn't want to see her.  It sounds like he offered, and she declined because he had the kids.  That is understandable.  It just sounds like a shitty week for everyone involved, and he prioritized his children.   As I said in my original post, if she wants to be a parent at some point, she will have to understand that mindset.", "Did you even read his comment?", "Why are you allowing your kids to be around such a violent woman? Mother or not she\u2019s abusive and shouldn\u2019t be near the children.", "I stayed with them with their mother, we had outings together. Her parents offered to watch the kids a few hours a day, but they only had availabilities when we already had made plans. I didn't want to disappoint my boys by cancelling our plans", "Yeah, adults don\u2019t need emotional support!", "How do you not see that you have the reading comprehension of a three year old. Did I say he had to abandon his children?! I told the AH calling her instead of actually going to see her for at least an hour a day makes him an AH. Im sorry you feel that partners should be neglected because you have children. Im going to assume you are also single.", "Adults have to make hard decisions, regardless of whether others agree with those choices. That doesn\u2019t make them undeserving of processing grief or empathy from others.", "Actually, it was my Ex beating her partner. Thats why she and I broke up. Still, very traumatizing for my kids of course..", "See his comments, he had grandparents that offered - but it clashed with activities they\u2019ve planned for the holidays.", "yeah, but late .. so she's doing the beating to her partners , well that's even worse so I stand by my assessment that she's the AH", "whoaaaa OP , so you not only ditched you fiancee completely, but you also refused help from grandparents to do family outings with your ex-wife and them when your fiancee recovered from an abortion? \n\nCan you imagine how she must've felt ? Look as it is, I think you don't have a capacity to have a serious relationship... also I think your ex-wife maybe did this on purpose partially as well, she sounds absolutely toxic. you should be very careful regarding your boys and her", "You stayed with them with the mum they just witnessed abusing her partner? Wow you\u2019re a huge AH op!!!", "Giant YTA. You need to put this in your original post so people know what actually happened.", "And this is what makes you TAH.", "I was thinking N A H until I read that your ex is physically abusive and the one who traumatised your children. You are allowing your children around an abuser - your abuser - and are attempting to normalise the situation with family days out at the expense of your own children and in this instance also your partner by hiding behind the easiest option available to you and labelling it \u201cprioritising them,\u201d rather than putting boundaries down with their mum and giving your children a safe environment. You broke up with her due to her physical abuse and yet you\u2019re still exposing your children to that dynamic where she\u2019s continued to be violent and your children are terrified. YTA", "Ok but you have to understand that her perspective is that you couldn\u2019t be with her to comfort her and one of those reasons was you were having outings with them and your ex? \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with having outings with your children and their mother. But right at this time, when she made a difficult choice, and needed you as well, she was relegated to phone calls. \nI\u2019m saying NAH, you were in a difficult situation. But she does have to be wondering, if you had a child together, would she still end up in this position?", "Just to clarify - your sons witnessed their mother physically abusing her now ex partner, you pick them up due to the trauma of the situation, and then proceeded to take the kids back daily to spend time with their mom who they just witnessed physically abuse someone? YTA", "After reading this comment, YTA. I was going to say N A H, but this?!?!\n\nShe NEEDED you. You refused help from the grandparent, went on OUTINGS with your EX and the boys, yet couldn\u2019t carve ONE hour to go and check on her or be with her during something traumatic?!!!\n\nYou asshole. If she leaves, it was well earned. Bc if you truly loved her, you could\u2019ve given her one damn hour and not just a phone call.", "so you had chances to divide your time to spend with your grieving fiance, even just a little, and chose not to?", "Traumatized children need it more in this case. He called her every single day. That's support.", "possibly moreso to be honest, or at least equally as damaging just in different way. My point is just the kids were in at *least* as bad of a place as the partner and likely way worse. Their needs should be put first on account of them being children who had no choices in this situation\n\nOP had no good options, but chose the best one", "actually thought so tbh , also she sounded like she could not handle her kids for the whole week (regardless of the drama with beating)"]}
