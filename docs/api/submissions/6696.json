I said no just browsing and hoping I don\u2019t buy too much, and she said no, for that man. I giggled and said oh no he wasn\u2019t hitting on me that\u2019s my bf.\n\nWe went back and forth until I said ma\u2019am that\u2019s my bf and we\u2019re happy with kids, leave it at that\n\nGot groceries, but when I walked out after we paid two police officers came to me with the woman. She said that I\u2019m safe and the officers will protect me, and I can go to the station.\n\nI froze, looked at the officers and told them to stop, pulled my ID out and told them I have children. The officers looked flabbergasted and glanced at the woman asking if she knew my age and she said no she never told me she just asked me for help when I talked to her so I called! They said well you also told us she was very obviously a minor but the ID on her says otherwise.\n\nThe woman snatched my (military)ID, \n then said it was fake to buy alcohol. I blinked and said \u201cdo you know how hard it would be to fake a military ID?\u201d\n \nThe officers left and I tried to leave too but she got MAD asking why I didnt tell her I wasnt a minor and I should have let her know\n\nI mean I told her that I was fine, I told her he was my bf and we had 2 kids. Maybe she thought I had them YOUNG, I also didn\u2019t specify their age?\n\nBut I tried not to overreact, I was annoyed but knew these situations happen so I tried saying Im glad you worry about these things and its always better that you call in secrecy to not alarm the suspect, and if it\u2019s false then at least you tried \n\nShe just yelled at me louder saying I embarrassed her, she was late for a party now because \u201cshe was so worried about me\u201d and I should be more considerate. I said thanks, I do appreciate it, and then she shouted \u201cWHY DO YOU APPRECIATE IT YOU DIDNT EVEN NEED HELP\u201d and unfortunately I snapped, told her it\u2019s not my fault what the fuck do you want from me, to say I\u2019m a minor and let my bf get arrested? I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re late but holy shit mind your business!\n\nI pushed passed her but she followed and stood in front of my bf\u2019s car blocking him.\n\nI told my bf to stay in the car and started yelling at her, I was angry and just didn\u2019t know what she wanted from me. I guess it occurred to her I have kids at home and she finally left, in a huff, no apology at all. Dinner ended up being served late, and I had an angry toddler.\n\nI told some friends the story and they think I shouldnt have yelled, she just wanted to help, but like? I don\u2019t know maybe I am, but I think I was justified, but maybe yelling wasn\u2019t the answer.\n\nI guess Id like to know AITA for not being more understanding?", "created_utc": 1673045276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1058436/aita_for_not_being_more_understanding_to_a_woman/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry for the misunderstanding, you just looked so young, I was worried for you. I hope you have a good day.\"\n\nThat's how she *should* have reacted upon finding out that you were perfectly safe. A normal person would have been *relieved* once they knew you weren't in danger.\n\nHer reaction though? That shows that she was less interested in protecting a vulnerable person and more interested in being \"the hero,\" getting congratulated on what a good job she did saving someone from harm. \n\nAnd that's why she turned on you. Her actions may have looked like a misguided yet thoughtful attempt to help someone in need, but they were actually an AH-ish way to get attention.\n\nNTA for reacting the way you did... Once she attacked you, yelling is a perfectly reasonable reaction", "*she just yelled at me louder saying I embarrassed her*  \nNTA  \nSo it was your fault she falsely accused your bf of grooming a minor & lied to the police?

Her family is Indian\u2026. But who knows what\u2019s mixed up in there. My dad is Caucasian British also a bit of a mix. I ended up with a pale tan complexion, almond eyes, etc. My appearance has caused problems when I\u2019m with my dad; especially when I was a teenager.\n\nThe story. My age 16. My dad 50ish. This is the jist of the encounter.\n\nMy dad and I enter a coffee shop. We find a table. He goes to order us a coffee and bagel. The moment he was a fair distance from the table \u2018She\u2019 appears.\n\n\u2018She\u2019 = annoying senior Caucasian woman. \n\nShe starts off with. \u2018Honey.\u2019 Already a bad beginning. \u2018Who is that man you\u2019re with?\u2019\n\nMe. Sensing trouble. \u2018My dad.\u2019\n\nHer. \u2018Now. You don\u2019t need to worry. You can tell me the the truth. Who is he?\u2019\n\nMe. A bit annoyed. \u2018I told you. He\u2019s my dad.\u2019\n\nHer. \u2018Are you sure? He\u2019s not here. You can tell me.\u2019\n\nMe. Slightly frustrated. \u2018He\u2019s my dad.\u2019 Looking for him to come back now. Need help.\n\nHer. \u2018Are you sure? Because\u2026. I\u2019m worried about this.\u2019\n\nMe. \u2018Lady. I\u2019m biracial. That\u2019s when two people from different backgrounds have children. That\u2019s my dad. My mom is South American.\u2019\n\nHer. \u2018And where\u2019s your mom then? I want to make sure.\u2019\n\nMe. Sigh. Should have seen that one coming. \u2018They\u2019re divorced. I live with my dad. Please go away.\u2019\n\nHer. Sputters. \u2018Now, I think you\u2019re lying to protect him. I\u2019m going to call the police.\u2019\n\nMy dad is now walking back. Hears that last part.\n\nMy dad. \u2018Leave my daughter alone.\u2019\n\nHer. \u2018You disgust me. This poor child. I\u2019m taking her with me. We\u2019ll be talking to the police.\u2019\n\nMy dad waves for an employee\u2026 who was already coming towards us. Employee hustles over. Lady tries to squawk out a request to call the police and make sure my dad doesn\u2019t leave, etc. Both my dad and I verify our relation. She gets louder, when the employee asks her to sit away from us, or leave. She doesn\u2019t like either option. Gets more loud. Manager comes. Kicks her out.\n\nAs we were leaving she was on a pay phone (early 2000\u2019s) babbling quickly. Her babbles gets quicker when she sees us leaving. And she starts shouting for us to stay. My dad rolls his eyes. And takes off at a brisk pace towards his car. I follow. But\u2026. Before we turn around a corner, I turn and give the one finger salute to \u2018her.\u2019 Not my finest moment, but very satisfying.", "NTA at all. Busybodies are the worst. It's nice that she asked, but with the rest of her responses I think your reaction was well justified.", "NTA. She pushed it too far and then just kept pushing. It seems to me that she got upset because she had a whole story and scenario in her head where she got to be the savior.", "NTA I don't get people like this. What did she think she was gonna do if that was the case? Plus it's her just feeling her trying to feel important. She deserved to be yelled at for her righteous indignation.", "NTA. She should've stayed in her lane and minded her own business once you explained everything. Then she proceeded to call the cops, lie to them and waste their time. She should've been arrested as falsely calling the cops is an arrestable offense. Then she also started blocking you and your bf from leaving. She's lucky she didn't get run over. Any lesser person would've done that.", "NTA, It's a good thing she's looking out for that but it's not your fault she assumed shit, and at that she FOLLOWED YOU TO YOUR CAR at that point she was being a dick.", "NTA  \nThe woman who \"helped\" you has some issues.", "As someone who have young/baby face, and only 4'9. I feel this. \ud83d\ude2d (and 30yrs old on top of that)\n\nNta", "NTA. Anyone would have snapped. I\u2019ve got a reputation for being calm cool and collected and even I would have pulled a \u201cLISTEN LADY\u201d followed by many obscenities.", "NTA. Had she dropped it when she was proven wrong in her meddling it wouldn\u2019t have escalated, but she doubled down and acted like a nut and got what she had coming. I think you were fairly restrained given the circumstances.", "People who want to be virtuous crusaders for \u201cchildren\u201d but have a limited ability to actually take in the facts are a hazard to us all. It\u2019s infuriating when someone won\u2019t listen and interferes even after being assured you are okay - with documentation. And the yelling and standing in front of your car when it was clear she was in the wrong? A few slipped cogs for sure. Plus you\u2019re late to feed your baby? NTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly I don't see why she was yelling at you after it was made clear that you're a consenting adult.", "NTA.  If anything, you were too understanding.", "NTA: She called the police to arrest your significant other, and then doubled down, and then continued to escalate instead of admitting she was wrong and allowing you to leave. You are a saint for not calling the police on her for blocking the car.", "NTA.  You have just engaged with a lunatic.  It's one thing to help, but freaking out because she made a wrong call is not your problem.  Also, standing in front of the car?  really? \n\nDon't let this crazy person take another moment of your day. \n\nCheers.", "NTA - You were understanding the first how many times?  How many more would you need to meet the requirement?   I get that she wanted to help, and even that sometimes someone under duress would pretend to be ok to avoid more trouble, but ffs you provided photo ID to the police.  That should have been the end of it.", "NTA.  Even IF you were a teen, calling the cops was a dick move.  I once was the teen being groomed, and I would have been PISSED if someone had done that to me, because I thought I was special, not being offended upon.  You clearing up that you were the gf and not in danger, and then her taking it further, and then taking it EVEN further, is her fault.  She embarrassed herself, and you didn't yell at her for trying to protect you, you yelled at her for assholery.  She doesn't get to blame you for her embarrassment.", "LOL. NTA. You were very understanding! \nShe meant well, but her being wrong is not your fault, and you did not embarrass her. She needs to chill.", "NTA. She approached you with good intentions and you thanked her and informed her you were okay. That should have been the end of it. Even giving her a pass for involving the police (because grooming and trafficking victims often won't say they need help), after you explained to the police and showed your ID that should have been enough. She went too far and started behaving in a way that would qualify as harassment. You're NTA for getting frustrated. Especially as you were perfectly polite to her until she crossed the line into unacceptable behaviour.", "NTA.\n\nShe took it too far and then to blame you for her taking it too far...", "NTA, a stranger called the cops on you, took your personal identification and read your personal information, and then continued to harass you.\n\nIn no way was she talking about helping you, what she was doing was harassing you, for reference if something like this ever happens again, when the cops show up, you have them escort you and your partner to your vehicle so that you aren't left alone to deal with the person who is harassing you.", "She didn't give a shit about you.\n\nShe just wanted the attention of being a \"hero\". When the situation didn't work out how she wanted she imagined all those Facebook likes dissolving away and so got mad at you for ruining her internal autobiography.\n\nNTA", "NTA Maybe she had good intentions, but she made a false 911 call when she pretended you asked for help and then harassed you because she made a completely unprovoked mistake.", "She was crazy. \n\nIf you \"look\" like a woman, I bet she thought you were a victim of human trafficking.  \nIf you \"look\" like a man, I bet she is with the insane group that thinks all homosexual are groomers. \n\nYou should sue her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
