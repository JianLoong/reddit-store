I think your son might need some therapy. You're right that the behavior/obsession is not typical. He needs guidance as a 10 year old boy, and you need guidance as a parent, and a professional is the best person to provide that. We all need a little help sometimes when something falls outside of our parenting wheelhouse. Good luck.", "He's 10. You can't just tell him to work on his obsession and expect him to solve this on his own. He needs more help than that. How about getting him into therapy so you guys can gain insight into why he's doing this and any fears/concerns he has, and develop strategies to cope when your sister wants/needs some privacy and downtime.\n\n> I want to raise a responsible child which means correcting him when necessary.\n\nRather than trying to \"correct\" his behaviour by telling him what do do, try to listen and empathize with where he is coming from so you can get to the bottom of it and work through it together and teach him why it's important to respect her boundaries.", "NTA\n\nI would advise getting your son into therapy. Children don't always understand adult boundaries and obviously that needs to be explained to them, but he is clearly fixated on her to the point of obsession. Especially if he is concerned that she will not love him unless he is constantly in her space. It seems like there is a greater issue at play. This is very much a job for a mental health professional. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with him, but he might be coping with some thing else in an unhealthy way", "Info: have you actually talked to him about why he does it? At ten years old, he should be able to communicate it as long as he feels safe to tell the truth.\n\nI agree with the others that suggest that counseling might be effective here, in case the counselor picks up on some detail that you didn't think was important.\n\nTrying to just tell a 10yo kid not to do something can result in unexpectedly worse behavior if he doesn't have a decent enough grasp on why you're telling him not to do it. He might take the instruction too far or not far enough, depending on his interpretation of what you're saying.", "You need to not only talk to him, you need to start enforcing those boundaries with consequences when he crosses them.  Your sister needs to respect those boundaries and let you parent your son.  And if that's not viable, you and your son might need a different living situation.", "Absolutely not. It's actually kinda creepy behavior IMO. It sounds like he's got something similar to an odipious (I know I miss spelled that) complex. \n\nYou were absolutely right to tell him he needs to back off a bit. He's 10 and is completely obsessing over her and refusing to respect her boundaries. \n\nDoes he act like this around other women? Or just your sister? This could be the start of something worse if it doesn't get nipped in the bud. I recommend to really start paying attention to the things he reads, watches, and does\n\nBy the time he hits puberty, you guys need to be moved out I think. He may end up doing something that could put your sister in danger and also ruin his life.", "Why haven't you taken him to therapy?", "NTA, if you have had this conversation sometimes kids need more direct wording that may come off harsh. I know he is just a kid but it is definitely a bit creepy.", "NTA\n\nAlso, get a lock installed on your sister's door so she has privacy", "NTA, but your sister should\u2019ve set the boundaries.  It would\u2019ve been better received.", "Whaaaaaa did I just read???? \n\nALL of this behavior is extremely inappropriate- especially for a 10 year old! \n\nGet him to a therapist or family counseling stat - what is happening here???\n\nESH - you for allowing this behavior to grow and your sister for apparently scolding you for scolding your son??", "Why haven't you taken this kid to therapy? You're not the AH for correcting him, but YTA for not getting him help.", "Why did you let this go as far as this though? You should have been putting a stop to each and every one of the behaviours you listed.", "NTA for trying to raise a son that respects women and boundaries but it sounds like your son needs professional help. This is not normal behaviour.", "YTA for letting it get this bad. Get him to therapy. He obviously has something going on that is too much to expect a 10 year old to process and handle on his own.", "Does he have any men in his life?  A coach, teacher, uncle, grandpa?  A man he respects could help him understand that good decent men do not spy or stalk or obsess over woman. They are not possessions or objects.", "NTA - he's being totally inappropriate and manipulative.", "NTA. He knows hes being weird as shit. You and your sister need to set some boundaries and stop allowing this to happen.", "This is something that should\u2019ve been corrected sooner if you talking to him isn\u2019t helping he may need therapy this can stem from something deeper.", "NTA, but also he's 10 years old and while his behavior comes off creepy I think he genuinely just loves his aunt and wants to spend alot of time with her, he definitely needs help to express his love in a healthier way and stop acting this way, but also he probably doesn't understand it when you say that his behavior is wrong because in his eyes he's just trying to spend alot of time with his aunt, I hope you find him a good therapist and get through this situation in a healthy way so he stops acting this way.", "YTA for calling him obsessive and for not taking him to a professional about this.", "Nta. I was ready to complain, but you literally described my separation anxiety driven chihuahua.", "Well, we've heard what you said to him, but what does your son have to say? Have you asked him about his \"obsession\" - which is not an appropriate way of talking to a 10 year old. Sounds like he has some attachment issues.\n\nYATA for telling your son he's obsessive, which is essentially pathologizing a child. You might want to take him to a therapist so that this kid is invited to talk about how he's feeling and why he's acting as he is with an adult, rather than just shaming and chastising him. This is a little boy you're talking about, and his motives are emotional.\n\nYou're making a little boy who's obviously lonely and looking for a secure attachment figure like he's some kind of creepy stalker - not cool.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would throw you both out of my house if you were my sister. this is creepy and disturbing as fuck .....and you seem to be ok with this! wtf???", "Nta. I was ready to complain, but you literally described my separation anxiety driven chihuahua.", "NTA. This reminds me a bit of something I used to do when I was about that age, and I'm wondering if it's a similar issue. When you're a kid, it can be hard to separate the different kinds of \"love\", and which is appropriate for who. \n\nSo I remember watching The Addams Family and seeing how Gomez treated Morticia, and thinking \"wow ok that's how you're meant to treat someone you love\", then also thinking that I love my mum and dad, and assuming this meant I should treat them the same way. Which resulted in me being a little weirdo to my parents for a few weeks.\n\nSo possibly he saw something about how to treat a woman you love, and is just applying it wrong? It's worth a conversation about family-love vs romance-love, I think.", "NTA. This is all disturbing behavior. You need to have a talk with your sister about boundaries. This won't be \"cute\" when he's still doing this in 5 years or to someone else.", "NTA: Your son isn\u2019t 2, he\u2019s 10. This is very obsessive and quite honestly a bit weird. He needs to be able to give her space, if not, what happens as he gets older? Get him into some sort of therapy definitely", "Damn That's creepy. Has he said anything about WHY je's acting like this?", "NTA   You did the right thing AND he's your child!  You're the one who decides how to talk to him.  It sounds like it was getting a little weird.  He may need therapy.", "\"AITA for trying to raise a son that respects women?\" Weird question from someone who's raising a kid completely without boundaries. YTA for not getting involved sooner. It sounds exhausting that your sister has to put up with this and you're raising him to know he's allowed everywhere at all times.", "Son DEFINITELY needs therapy. Dk what's going on with him but he needs a hand because something isn't being processed correctly.", "I completely agree.  I'm not sure if her son's behavior is OCD related, but when someone has an obsession, they're not magically going to get rid of it because you ask them to.  Instead of \"correcting\" him every time he bothers his aunt, having him talk to a therapist would be more beneficial.", "This makes sense. I never looked at it this way. We have moved around a lot in the last 5 years due to the nature of my job so it\u2019s possible that he has separation anxiety which manifests itself in this fixation.\n\nYou have given me a lot to think about. I will arrange for him to get into therapy as soon as possible. Thank you for this, I appreciate you.", "Hello. Yes I have talked to him about why he does it. He usually says he just wants to be next to her or that he\u2019s bored and wants to keep her company. His answers are usually a variation of those two sentences.\n\nBut when he was found at her door in the hallway at 10pm he had nothing to say for himself. He said he didn\u2019t know why he was there and genuinely had a puzzled/confused look on his face the whole time I was talking to him then came the waterworks.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here so yes to the therapy, I admit we do need help.", "He doesn\u2019t enter my room without knocking and when he is in my room, he doesn\u2019t touch anything unless he is told to. I\u2019ve heard my little sister telling him to knock before he enters her room or telling him not to touch her stuff though so this talk was mainly a \u201crespect all women and adults\u201d. \n\nThe thing is, with my little sister it\u2019s just the not knocking and occasionally touching her stuff when looking for something but he only does the interrupting, following, watching and clinging to my older sister.\n\nHe has a little sister who is 5 and a cousin who is 2 and obviously as toddlers, they look up to him and copy him a lot. I really don\u2019t want them picking up this habit and running with it. He is a good child and I know he can exercise restraint where my sisters are concerned the same way he does when it comes to my room.", "Oedipus", "Yea so far, OP is light asshole by not nipping this out sooner.", "I have been. Like I said, both my older sister and I have had this conversation with him before but he doesn\u2019t listen. He\u2019ll stop for a few hours or a day or two then go right back to it.\n\nI\u2019m saving up to move to our own place soon but that\u2019s still a ways off. Maybe therapy or asking his grandparents to have a word with him will help in the meantime.", "He has an uncle and a grandpa that live about 8 hours away. He listens to them so I\u2019ll get them on the phone with him first thing in morning. Thank you.", "I understand the not taking him to a professional bit but, genuinely curious, how is his behaviour not obsessive? I don't want to start an argument or anything I just want to understand your perspective haha", "I honestly think he's a little precocious and is dealing with his first crush, and even sexual feelings. It happened to me too, I was already fascinated with stuff I couldn't really deal with - nudity, being close to women, close skin contact etc. from an early age.\n\nGet that therapy. This might be the best chance to have him grow into a healthy and respectful relationship with his sexuality and how that relates to others.", "I was the type of kid that just velcroed on to an adult that showed affection, like my uncle or a family friend.  But this seems a bit excessive, especially as your son can\u2019t explain why he was in the hallway. Either he is lying and thus knows his behaviour is wrong, yet still does it. Or maybe he is sleep walking?\n\nI don\u2019t need to know the details, but could it have to do with why you live with your sister? Has he lost or been rejected by another adult/parent figure and he\u2019s over compensating?", "Your sister is also not helping by undermining your parenting.", "I agree with the other poster, I don\u2019t necessarily think you definitely need therapy for this specific incident but it wouldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nA lot of smaller kids love and want to marry dad or mom or a sibling because to children and even a 10 year old who is having some conflicting emotions love is simply love. You just love people and want to be with them. \n\nI was a bit over emotional in some ways as a child but normal or even distant in others but I loved certain people. I was convinced I would marry my dentist and around that age tried to put my arms around him and tell him he was handsome. As a girl it was a funny story but If I had more contact with my dentist I could see how I might have started getting really weird.\n\nFor me their was no set reason. I just liked the guy and I guess on some level I know hey I can\u2019t marry this person but it didn\u2019t really stick.\n\nBe careful though if he is crushing on her then simply saying \u201cyou can\u2019t be together you are family\u201d wont work either. \n\nYou need to set clear guidelines, hey we always knock, wait this amount of time before entering, she lives you but she doesn\u2019t like your actions. You don\u2019t want him being like this with an actual girlfriend.\n\nOn a side note he most likely on some level knows it isn\u2019t right but doesn\u2019t see harm in his actions. He is defensive because he doesn\u2019t exactly know how to respond or act, which is a trait that could use counseling.", "It sounds like OP has been addressing this behavior but that there's something going on with the kiddo that will require some professional help. I don't think that OP is at fault for taking a little bit of time to recognize that this behavior falls outside the spectrum of normal or healthy attachment.", "You're the parent. Parent him. Apply consequences to his actions. Teach him. This isn't something for his grandparents to solve. This is something for you to handle.", "I agree therapy is needed at this point. I also wouldn\u2019t rely on your family to parent your son. My nephew would never go in my room without knocking, he would never be in there when I\u2019m getting ready for work,\u2026. because his parents taught him to respect privacy and boundaries.", "But going off of this after your son has this talk with them YOU need to be the one to take action. Set consequences for his actions don\u2019t just tell him things"]}
