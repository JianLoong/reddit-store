He can do no wrong in my family's eyes. He is my little prince but I want to raise a responsible child which means correcting him when necessary. Last year, we moved in with my older sister (35f).  I love the bond that the two of them share and at first I thought he was just excited about living with his favourite aunt but 8 months later, this seems to be getting worse.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me if this is okay:\r\n- He insists on getting ready for school from her room meaning she can\u2019t get ready for work in private\r\n- He follows her from the gate all the way to her room when she gets off work meaning she can\u2019t change in private\r\n- He enters her room without knocking, goes through her stuff, reads her messages, takes her stuff, sulks and/or comes right back when asked to leave her room\r\n- He follows her everywhere around the house and if he isn\u2019t next to her, you simply have to count to 10 and he\u2019ll be there\r\n- He will not sit anywhere except close to where she is sitting\r\n- He sometimes asks to go to her workplace if she\u2019s not home by the time she normally gets home\r\n- He sulks when she asks him for some space so she can shower or sleep\r\n- She has online evening classes. He\u2019ll barge into her room at least five or six times during her class unless she tells him no\r\n- He can sit by her feet or next to her just watching her until she asks him to stop or she gets up\r\n- Try to have a private conversation with my sister? He will interrupt incessantly or do  something to get her attention \r\n- He wakes her up from afternoon naps or in the middle of the night because he wants to tell/ask/show her something\r\n- He hangs out with his friends during the day, reads, does homework, watches TV and just goes about his day until my sister gets home then he drops everything and focuses on her\r\n\r\nA few days ago, I asked him to go to bed then my sister opened her bedroom door about 45 minutes later and lo and behold, my son was standing in the dark hallway\u2026just waiting by her door at nearly 10pm.\n\nI explained to him that he needs to give my sister some space and stop following her everywhere. I assured him that he can express his love in a healthy and respectful way and she won\u2019t love him any less if he isn\u2019t following her around. I said his behaviour comes off a little obsessive which is not cool. I also explained that, as a woman and an adult, she needs privacy within the confines of her bedroom and must not enter her room  unless she asks him to.\n\nHe was visibly upset with this. It isn\u2019t the first time that I or my sister have had *this* talk with him but she said I went too far. I said at 10 years old, he can learn and respect boundaries. She said I was too harsh on him and called me an AH so I\u2019m here to ask, AITA for trying to raise a son that respects women?\n\nETA: Thank you to everyone that has engaged with me in a civil manner (which is a lot of you). I\u2019d never come across this type of behaviour before so thank you to everyone that shared similar stories and their endings. I needed to see those stories. I have shared this with my sister and she agrees that we need to get him help.\n\nAs I said in some comments, therapy or openly discussing mental health isn\u2019t very common in my country so it genuinely didn\u2019t cross my mind as a possible solution. All I was thinking is \u201ctalk and reinforce boundaries and consequences.\u201d\n\nI see now that this kind of behaviour warrants some professional intervention and I have began looking for an expert that can help us deal with this. I believe in my son and believe that he can change and I\u2019m grateful to everyone that didn\u2019t completely write us off.

I think your son might need some therapy. You're right that the behavior/obsession is not typical. He needs guidance as a 10 year old boy, and you need guidance as a parent, and a professional is the best person to provide that. We all need a little help sometimes when something falls outside of our parenting wheelhouse. Good luck.", "He's 10. You can't just tell him to work on his obsession and expect him to solve this on his own. He needs more help than that. How about getting him into therapy so you guys can gain insight into why he's doing this and any fears/concerns he has, and develop strategies to cope when your sister wants/needs some privacy and downtime.\n\n> I want to raise a responsible child which means correcting him when necessary.\n\nRather than trying to \"correct\" his behaviour by telling him what do do, try to listen and empathize with where he is coming from so you can get to the bottom of it and work through it together and teach him why it's important to respect her boundaries.", "NTA\n\nI would advise getting your son into therapy. Children don't always understand adult boundaries and obviously that needs to be explained to them, but he is clearly fixated on her to the point of obsession. Especially if he is concerned that she will not love him unless he is constantly in her space. It seems like there is a greater issue at play. This is very much a job for a mental health professional. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with him, but he might be coping with some thing else in an unhealthy way", "Info: have you actually talked to him about why he does it? At ten years old, he should be able to communicate it as long as he feels safe to tell the truth.\n\nI agree with the others that suggest that counseling might be effective here, in case the counselor picks up on some detail that you didn't think was important.\n\nTrying to just tell a 10yo kid not to do something can result in unexpectedly worse behavior if he doesn't have a decent enough grasp on why you're telling him not to do it. He might take the instruction too far or not far enough, depending on his interpretation of what you're saying.", "You need to not only talk to him, you need to start enforcing those boundaries with consequences when he crosses them.  Your sister needs to respect those boundaries and let you parent your son.  And if that's not viable, you and your son might need a different living situation.", "Absolutely not. It's actually kinda creepy behavior IMO. It sounds like he's got something similar to an odipious (I know I miss spelled that) complex. \n\nYou were absolutely right to tell him he needs to back off a bit. He's 10 and is completely obsessing over her and refusing to respect her boundaries. \n\nDoes he act like this around other women? Or just your sister? This could be the start of something worse if it doesn't get nipped in the bud. I recommend to really start paying attention to the things he reads, watches, and does\n\nBy the time he hits puberty, you guys need to be moved out I think. He may end up doing something that could put your sister in danger and also ruin his life.", "Why haven't you taken him to therapy?", "NTA, if you have had this conversation sometimes kids need more direct wording that may come off harsh. I know he is just a kid but it is definitely a bit creepy.", "NTA\n\nAlso, get a lock installed on your sister's door so she has privacy", "NTA, but your sister should\u2019ve set the boundaries.  It would\u2019ve been better received.", "Whaaaaaa did I just read???? \n\nALL of this behavior is extremely inappropriate- especially for a 10 year old! \n\nGet him to a therapist or family counseling stat - what is happening here???\n\nESH - you for allowing this behavior to grow and your sister for apparently scolding you for scolding your son??", "Why haven't you taken this kid to therapy? You're not the AH for correcting him, but YTA for not getting him help.", "Why did you let this go as far as this though? You should have been putting a stop to each and every one of the behaviours you listed.", "NTA for trying to raise a son that respects women and boundaries but it sounds like your son needs professional help. This is not normal behaviour.", "YTA for letting it get this bad. Get him to therapy. He obviously has something going on that is too much to expect a 10 year old to process and handle on his own.", "Does he have any men in his life?  A coach, teacher, uncle, grandpa?  A man he respects could help him understand that good decent men do not spy or stalk or obsess over woman. They are not possessions or objects.", "NTA - he's being totally inappropriate and manipulative.", "NTA. He knows hes being weird as shit. You and your sister need to set some boundaries and stop allowing this to happen.", "This is something that should\u2019ve been corrected sooner if you talking to him isn\u2019t helping he may need therapy this can stem from something deeper.", "NTA, but also he's 10 years old and while his behavior comes off creepy I think he genuinely just loves his aunt and wants to spend alot of time with her, he definitely needs help to express his love in a healthier way and stop acting this way, but also he probably doesn't understand it when you say that his behavior is wrong because in his eyes he's just trying to spend alot of time with his aunt, I hope you find him a good therapist and get through this situation in a healthy way so he stops acting this way.", "YTA for calling him obsessive and for not taking him to a professional about this.", "Nta. I was ready to complain, but you literally described my separation anxiety driven chihuahua.", "Well, we've heard what you said to him, but what does your son have to say? Have you asked him about his \"obsession\" - which is not an appropriate way of talking to a 10 year old. Sounds like he has some attachment issues.\n\nYATA for telling your son he's obsessive, which is essentially pathologizing a child. You might want to take him to a therapist so that this kid is invited to talk about how he's feeling and why he's acting as he is with an adult, rather than just shaming and chastising him. This is a little boy you're talking about, and his motives are emotional.\n\nYou're making a little boy who's obviously lonely and looking for a secure attachment figure like he's some kind of creepy stalker - not cool.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This reminds me a bit of something I used to do when I was about that age, and I'm wondering if it's a similar issue. When you're a kid, it can be hard to separate the different kinds of \"love\", and which is appropriate for who. \n\nSo I remember watching The Addams Family and seeing how Gomez treated Morticia, and thinking \"wow ok that's how you're meant to treat someone you love\", then also thinking that I love my mum and dad, and assuming this meant I should treat them the same way.

I'm not sure if her son's behavior is OCD related, but when someone has an obsession, they're not magically going to get rid of it because you ask them to.

Or maybe he is sleep walking?\n\nI don\u2019t need to know the details, but could it have to do with why you live with your sister?

You don\u2019t want him being like this with an actual girlfriend.\n\nOn a side note he most likely on some level knows it isn\u2019t right but doesn\u2019t see harm in his actions.

Refusing to give your sister space, interrupting her while he knows she's in class, refusing to leave her alone, and reading her messages all sound like unhealthy behaviors he may have picked up elsewhere, and the help of a therapist to help him work through this could go a long way.\n\nI think many of us have had a relative we feel close to and want to spend a ton of time with, but I know if a relative I felt that way about asked me nicely to back off a bit I would take that very much to heart (and frankly probably be very embarrassed), it sounds like something is getting lost in translation when this is communicated to your son.

OP, my friends brother had an almost identical issue, down to his \"favorite person\" being their aunt. I am not saying in any way that what ended up happening to this boy is at all what will happen to yours, with that being said though, therapy was never a thing for him, he grew into a very awkward and quiet young man and ended up in jail multiple times for indecent exposure and public masturbation.

Why are you asking a question like \u201dhe barges into her room 6 times during her class\u201d. Its not your sisters job to always keep him away, you cannot outsource that to her. You need to be the parent and set boundaries for him. She of course also need to have her own boundaries. But you need to parent here, and now.

I\u2019m here because I\u2019m the only one insisting on setting boundaries for him in this house and this rubbed my sister the wrong way, was I not clear about that?\n\nAs I have said in other comments, I\u2019m aware that the behaviour he displayed is not okay. I\u2019m from a part of the world where therapy isn\u2019t placed at centre stage so I didn\u2019t think of that it as an option until it was brought up by some kind folk here. As soon as I read that therapy might help, I said I will look (and I actually have began to look) into getting him into therapy and get him the help that he needs. If I come off as unconcerned to you then I genuinely do not know how.\n\n> YTA and you are raising a little creepy little stalker\n\nYes, he has behaved inappropriately but I know his heart and I know that he can change so I do not appreciate the name calling.\n\n> I would throw you both out of my house if you were my sister.\n\nThat\u2019s quite alright dear, with the way you talk about children as if they\u2019re unredeemable, I wouldn\u2019t want to be related to you either and I\u2019m worried for any children that come around you.

He (my son) is close to my older brother and my father. They are good role models and they are the only consistent men in his life presently.\n\nI did take him with me to the mandatory counselling sessions that I attended when I left his father because I wanted him to talk to someone about his feelings. The other reason I took him with me was because I suspected that he could have ADHD but I was told that it was too early for them to diagnose him (I don\u2019t live in a first world country so I don\u2019t know if it was indeed too early or they didn\u2019t know *how* to diagnose). That was 5 years ago.

He also struggles with using an inside voice and will sometimes blurt out the first thing on his mind before reading the room.\n\nHe has gotten awards for his reading at school but when it comes to math, he jumbles numbers e.g he will see the number 624 and tell you that it\u2019s 624 but write it as 426 or 246.\n\nHe has been class prefect at most schools he\u2019s attended, he\u2019s skipped two grades, and his teachers praise him for good behaviour at school. All this makes me think he might be neurodivergent but like I said, I will get an expert opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find experts in this field in the country where we live but I\u2019ve got a few leads that I\u2019m looking into and I should be able to get us an appointment for him soon.

Now get your son to a psychologist to help him get past this awkward behavior.\n\nYour sister needs to back off: this is not her son and it is not her responsibility to raise him.  She should NOT be ok with his behavior, and given the invasion of privacy she is willing to tolerate, I would not want her living under the same roof as my son.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. \n\nYour son is behaving badly, especially when it comes to being told no. His response to being told to leave your sister alone to change is to get upset and angry. That is absolutely something to nip in the bud ASAP otherwise he could grow up to treat his adult partners this way. \n\n\nI work in a school, one of the students has been behaving this way towards me for several years. It started much like your son, following me around and always wanting attention. Now I have to be careful not to be alone in classrooms at certain times of day because otherwise he will try to follow me in for alone time- nothing untoward but wants my undivided attention without witnesses which I don\u2019t allow. He also tries constantly to touch me, hug me, stroke my hair, etc. He is on the spectrum and struggles to understand healthy boundaries so his obsession with wanting to do my hair is very strong but I have to be firm about appropriate behaviours. Staff are working with him on the behaviour but it takes patience and holding the boundary even if he gets upset because he has to learn healthy habits and we know it\u2019s takes time and repetition for him to get it. Your son needs the same thing: waiting outside your sisters door constantly is very creepy and on some level he knows that, just as my student knows on some level that his behaviours aren\u2019t ok which is why he wants me alone rather than with other staff around. \n\n\nPlease talk to your sister, agree a plan of action plus what discipline will be used when your son breaks the rules, explain these to him and then get ready to repeat yourself constantly and follow through with discipline when he breaks the rules. This is for his good and the good of women around him. \n\n\nYou will also need to be proactive and follow him/ intervene if he is waiting around for your sister or stalking outside her room. Physically move him on if necessary. I\u2019d advise speaking with a therapist for advice on how to accomplish all this and as someone who can help your son if necessary- and I think he will need therapy in order to understand and change his actions. \n\n\nI\u2019m not calling your son a stalker or any names here- I\u2019m concerned for him and for your sister and the sooner this behaviour is stopped the better for both of them. If he escalates or is making your sister uncomfortable then you may need to move out. She deserves to be safe in her home and your son may need a physical barrier between him and his aunt in order to amend his behaviour- I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t act this way with her prior to living together? Right now he is constantly in her space and has access to her private spaces, I\u2019d advise getting a lock for her door and keep the key on her person. \n\n\nIf you need any advice on handling this then message me, I know how horrible and difficult it is to have a child crushing on an adult and trying to balance being firm with being understanding of their needs and emotions. Good luck!", "Lock your sister's bedroom door.  Your son should NOT be in her bedroom.  It is inappropriate.  She needs to establish firm boundaries when she has classes.

Yes, and it\u2019s something that she has agreed to do after reading these comments with me.\n\nI think it\u2019s important for our kids to be surrounded by a loving and forgiving family and with the right professional guidance, I believe we can all exist under one roof amicably and part ways on a good note when it\u2019s time to.", "I appreciate your response and you sharing about your student.

This could end up scary!", "That was my thought as a good first step. She needs a lock on her door, because that can set an immediate physical boundary. I mean if he can\u2019t physically enter when she\u2019s trying to do her classes, sleep or get access to her stuff that\u2019s a start. I am sure he won\u2019t be happy but until you can get him therapy it will at least stop him from entering.

We kinda had to let him know that talking about his aunt like that was not ok.", "His father never went through my things or monitored my behaviour.

I\u2019ve never even seen it in an adult that I know or know of and I\u2019m observant. If it is learned behaviour then I\u2019m drawing blanks on where he could have learned it from.\n\nMaybe on TV, at school (he\u2019s in y7 and is the youngest in his class) or from friends.

Another common \"symptom\" if you want to call it that is he may also have trouble with his right & left or any kind of spatial reasoning  & was told it plays a part in why Ive always been \"clumsy\" and a bit awkward, not sure if that applies to your son. Most days I do well to repeat my own phone number without mixing it up and I've had it for ten years plus lol \n\nI also wasn't diagnosed until my 30s & severely struggled with anything math related but was reading advanced from the time I was in grade school.

I really wish you the best for the future in what's sure to be some difficult times - you are doing the right thing by trying to address what is going on now before it starts to heavily affect other parts of his development.

He has a math and science tutor and that has helped him a great deal but I still wish I\u2019d known all this sooner\u2026"]}
