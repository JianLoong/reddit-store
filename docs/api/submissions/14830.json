So for example, I can\u2019t really tell what her intentions were at the time but she urged me repeatedly to tell my ex about my new relationship before I posted it on social media (even though he\u2019s not on mine). It was before they got together but now looking back, I feel like her urging me and talking to me about it repeatedly is weird. She might have had completely pure intentions about caring about his feelings when he gets informed about my relationship or that she was dying to tell him but wanted it to come from me first. It\u2019s compounded stuff like these that have happened and have continued to happen over the days and years that make me lose trust.
