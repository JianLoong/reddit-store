It was before they got together but now looking back, I feel like her urging me and talking to me about it repeatedly is weird.

I know people say you can't own a person and that once you break up with them, they're free game, and yes that is true, **however** it wouldn't be remiss to *at least* tell that person \"*Hey, I know you used to date \\[name\\] so I just want to let you know, as a courtesy, that \\[name\\] and I are going to start dating.\"* It's not asking permission, it's just giving a heads up to a friend so that they don't potentially get blindsided or feel - as you do - betrayed; and doing so with the understanding that making the choice you are making - to date a friend or siblings ex, regardless of how their relationship ended - has the potential to come with relationship altering (or even shattering) consequences that cannot be reversed or fixed.\n\nIf your breakup was amicable, which I'm inclined to think since you say you wouldn't have minded them dating, then at the *least* she is saying that she doesn't care if you got blindsided by seeing them together, or hurt on the off-chance that you ended up wanting to get back together with him only to find out that they're dating (or finding out after you got back with him that he dated / potentially slept with your best friend). That she didn't care enough about your friendship to consider what would have happened if they lasted longer than they had, if they made it to the point of considering marrying, moving in together or having kids? If you found out at those points, and hadn't been happy, she was - perhaps without knowing it- saying that she would have been okay with some day facing the choice of leaving him once she had invested potentially years into their relationship, or losing your friendship.\n\nOn top of that, you say she's your best friend and so I'll assume that you guys hang out a lot and/or talk a lot? If that is true, that means that she *actively* kept their dating a secret from you; it wasn't that she just forgot to mention it and it was an accident that you never saw them together or heard about how her day doing xyz *included him*, it's that she intentionally never said anything and made sure that there would never be a situation in which you would see her with your ex.\n\nAnd if it wasn't amicable? Then your \"best friend of 10 years\" chose to date your ex despite the fact that it opened up the potential for someone who was toxic to remain in your life through his relationship with her, and that means she didn't care enough about you or your friendship and chose to risk your safety by dating him. (This is, of course, an entirely hypothetical situation. I don't think the breakup was acrimonious from the way you talk about not minding if they had dated.

I also want to just throw this out there...I don't think \"girl code\" or \"bro code\" are healthy concepts. Why prevent somebody else from potential happiness just because things didn't work out for you and that person? I maintain friendships with most of my exes as does my husband. I'm friends with his ex  and the mutual friend of ours that introduced us is my ex-boyfriend Jason. He's our best friend. We don't own people and you should be free to date whomever you want.

Sure, they only dated for 2 months and she doesn't \"owe\" you anytning BUT a good friend would have had enough respect for your friendship to confide in you because your friendship should be more important. With this one lie, it makes you wonder what else the person could have lied about and I get that. You have every right to feel the way you do. You even said that if she had come to you, you wouldn't even have cared. You just wish she had told you and she really should have. It's up to you to decide if you guys can work through this and maintain the friendship or if you feel like it's beyond repair.

First because no one has the right to dictate who someone else can and cannot date.  Our dating pool for the types of people we liked was very small.   We both agreed early on we were ok with sharing exs, because well, it would be inevitable ultimately.  We absolutely had the ability to say \"Person is off limits\" and usually it was respected.  The rare times it wasn't there was definitely a rift between us for a bit. \n\n\nMaybe it's because we around 40 now but I truly don't care if she wanted to date any of my exs (if she wasn't married).

The friend you had is now someone different and that can often lead to friends realising they aren't compatible.", "I just started dating the friend of an ex from 20 years ago. I made sure he told him within days of us getting together.", "I don't understand how you are the bad guy for being upset that she deliberately kept that relationship secret from you. She doesn't have to agree that she was shady, but she will have to accept that the relationship is different now, and you no longer see her as someone who is honest and forthright. Don't entertain the guilt trips she is offering. For someone who says she owes you nothing, she sure thinks you owe her a lot.\n\nNTA.", "NTA at all.\n\nSounds like she is caught up in herself and trying to make it about some abstract \"girl code/bro code\" when really she just didn't show you a basic consideration as a friend. \n\nI think others have shared a lot of good perspective. I just wanted to come on here and tell you I'm sorry you had this loss of trust from a good friend. I went through this (although details are completely different) and eventually saw that my friend didn't respect me in so many other ways. I eventually had to cut ties because I realized all she did was rationalize her bad behavior and never would get past her own selfishness. Not with me anyway. It was such a loss which I still feel sometimes. I don't know if that is where you are headed but I do want you  to realize that your feelings are valid.", "NTA\n\nIf you don\u2019t trust her, you don\u2019t trust her. That doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. \n\nI will say that I don\u2019t believe you get a say in who your friend dates and whether they tell you about it. 2 mos is not long and it obviously wasn\u2019t anything for her to write home about. She probably didn\u2019t want to hurt you over something that turned out to be just a fling. If they had become something serious, then I would think she\u2019d eventually find some way to tell you about it, but why open that door over what turned out to be nothing? \n\nAt least that\u2019s my thought as someone who has been in a similar situation from the pov of your friend. I had long-term friends who were a couple, and I loved them together and never thought to get between them. But then when they broke up, I had a short lived fling with one of them that I didn\u2019t tell the other about. She was already in another relationship and I had a lot of feelings for this dude but could tell I was just a rebound for him. We ended things amicably before I could get too hurt and I decided not to tell my other friend about it cause it seemed like unnecessary drama. There was no relationship to reveal, just a short tryst that had potential to hurt me more than either one of them. I would understand if she found out today, many years later, that she may be hurt for being left out of the loop. But I also do feel like it wasn\u2019t her business. I do sometimes feel like telling her just to clear the air and share something between us, but it\u2019s so long ago now and it was a blip on my dating radar that it feels like more drama than it\u2019s worth. I don\u2019t think your friend\u2019s the asshole here either. I don\u2019t think anyone is. But I can see how you would wonder what else she\u2019s capable of keeping from you, and it may be a fair question to ask.", "I won't say you are the AH but neither is she.\n\nAll the answers here are by bleeding hearts the hang out on r/relationshipadvice or are teenagers with no concept of adult relationships.\n\nYou and your ex weren't married or in a long term relationship from what it seema like and it sounds like she wasn't either. She doesn't owe you anything. Who cares if you both dated the same guy? Pull up your big girl pants and get over it.", "NTA you found out from a different source. She should've told you when she knew it was over. Or before anything happened with him. Or when she knew it was more than one date. Just so many options. SO many!", "NTA. I would never date a friends ex and hide it. That shows ill intent. You have every right to not speak to her. She broke a deep trust and doesn\u2019t deserve it back!", "NTA. They are not your friend and are trying to manipulate you into being the \"bad guy\". You feel unsafe because they are no longer a safe space. Do not let them convince you otherwise.", "A casual friend dating an ex without telling you is kind of iffy, but your best friend.....the person you confided in.... And then she's claiming she didn't realize it was wrong? Naw. She knew it was wrong since clearly mutuals knew, but she didn't tell OP. It wasn't a one time hook up either, it was for two months. And the friend doesn't even take an responsibility for her actions. It's about the girl code, it's about being an adult.\nNope, NTA.", "NTA. Here's the 3 dating rules I live by and taught my kids; they save a lot of pain. \n\n1. Don't date your family members' friends\n2. Don't date your friends' family members\n3. Don't date a friend's or family members' ex\n\nSo yeah, I wouldn't trust your friend either.", "ESH. She\u2019s right and you\u2019re right. You don\u2019t have to tell her you don\u2019t trust her and should probably just drift away. She doesn\u2019t owe you anything and in fact she did betray your trust. So yeah\u2026", "I'm surprised how far I had to scroll to find NAH.  They only dated for two months, which is a flash in the pan.  Maybe I'm just a cold rock, but I keep a lot to myself, and I don't expect even my closest friends to divulge anything unless they want to.", "Or it proves that she knew OP would blow it out of proportion. Like they're doing. He friend owed her no explanation or anything else. It was an ex. If you break up with someone, you no longer have any business to determine who they date. And it's childish to pull this \"I no longer trust you\" or \"you hurt my feelings\" because of it. \n\nOP is the asshole. And girl code and bro code is garbage as well.", "My best friend dated three of my exes and it ruined our friendship in highschool as a result. We are friends again and can now look back and say \"Jesus we were dumb to end our friendship over *boys*\" but, idk if it would've recovered if she had done it in secret in the first place", "Lilly and Zoe had been friends a long time. So I guess she wasn\u2019t quite ready to let go of the friendship. \n\nThings I learnt from that:\n\nWhen people show you who they are, believe them. \n\nFool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.", "I love the way you wrote that! The sass. I did not need any kind of extra sarcasm notation or anything. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that the issue with the friend is not just what\u2019s in the post. Initially, I was thinking that maybe your friend was waiting to make sure that it was serious before she told you, but the more I read your comments, the less I think that.", "NTA", "Is Zoe still with Lilly's ex?\n\nI'm guessing Zoe's friend group is much smaller now that she keeps dating her friends' exes.", "Maybe because the friend created a safe space for OP to share details about her relationship with the guy and then years later, OP finds out the friend harbored the same romantic feelings for the ex. It creates a weird dynamic. Like if it were another guy and you two are close friends, I'd imagine she would even be excited to mention she's dating someone.", "I wouldn\u2019t feel unsafe. Someone being manipulative and untrustworthy does not make them \u201cunsafe\u201d to be around.", "Yeah it\u2019s not really some code, it\u2019s just being a good friend which is not juvenile at all.", "No one said op posses her ex. She herself even said she would have at least like a warning not that she required permission. But if you deceive someone even if it\u2019s your right  you don\u2019t have a right to decide what their reactions should be", "Those are symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder", "We get it.  it's not gaslighting.  focus on OP.", "Anybody want a peanut?", "NTA. Who doesn't know that rule?", "NTA - commonsense would dictate that she would say something to you about dating an ex.  I would consider what she did as being sneaky.  I wouldn't trust her either nor would I keep her as a friend.", "It's a real thing if you're like 14.", "And this wasn\u2019t a situation in which they reconnected years after your breakup with him and started something.

You take everything at face value? Sad. You let trolls humor themselves and mock realistic world views. \n\nI've had friends date my ex partners it's called not being a self conscious ass.", "Ah, see, this clarified a lot. Other comments and the post made it seem like you were upset that you had shared with her immediately after break up, but well before she dated him, and wish you could take *that* back. But she was pumping you for info well after the break up.", "Amen\n There are millions of people in the world. You don't need to date your friend's ex.", "OPs friend by prying for information about OPs ex. Clear as day she was using OPs experience with this guy to get an upper hand", "Some people apply the term safe when it doesn't apply to physical safety. What I got from that comment was that she didn't any longer feel \"safe\" sharing details of her love life. Likely, because of what might be done with the knowledge. (I wouldn't simply because the friend doesn't share back, and I would find that two different levels of trust tend to indicate that one person is  more invested than the other)", "Ohhh okay not feeling safe to share details about their love life makes so much more sense. That wouldn\u2019t have ever occurred to me, thankyou for pointing that out to me. I\u2019ve always been sensitive to what information I share with others and their willingness to share with me has always been an indicator as to the level of trust/friendship we have so I agree,  I wouldn\u2019t have shared much either.", "I always respond, \"watch the movie that  made this a thing\".  It's good and worth the watch if only to see the VERY young Angela Lansbury as the flirty maid.", "This. NTA. OP, I would tell your friend, \"You have the right to date people's exes and lie about it to them, but I have the right to consider that a dealbreaker. Our friendship is over.\"\n\nThen, I'd block her on everything.", "If it feels like someone stabbed you in the back, check for the gaping wound. OP has a gaping wound.

Lilly was with the father of her child for over 10 years. \n\nZoe was really gorgeous and a party girl. So she was never shy of male attention and friends. Maybe that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t really value her friendships enough to not hurt her friends. \n\nWhen I first met Zoe she was in a relationship so I didn\u2019t see that side of her.
