It was before they got together but now looking back, I feel like her urging me and talking to me about it repeatedly is weird. She might have had completely pure intentions about caring about his feelings when he gets informed about my relationship or that she was dying to tell him but wanted it to come from me first.

I know people say you can't own a person and that once you break up with them, they're free game, and yes that is true, **however** it wouldn't be remiss to *at least* tell that person \"*Hey, I know you used to date \\[name\\] so I just want to let you know, as a courtesy, that \\[name\\] and I are going to start dating.\"* It's not asking permission, it's just giving a heads up to a friend so that they don't potentially get blindsided or feel - as you do - betrayed; and doing so with the understanding that making the choice you are making - to date a friend or siblings ex, regardless of how their relationship ended - has the potential to come with relationship altering (or even shattering) consequences that cannot be reversed or fixed.\n\nIf your breakup was amicable, which I'm inclined to think since you say you wouldn't have minded them dating, then at the *least* she is saying that she doesn't care if you got blindsided by seeing them together, or hurt on the off-chance that you ended up wanting to get back together with him only to find out that they're dating (or finding out after you got back with him that he dated / potentially slept with your best friend). That she didn't care enough about your friendship to consider what would have happened if they lasted longer than they had, if they made it to the point of considering marrying, moving in together or having kids? If you found out at those points, and hadn't been happy, she was - perhaps without knowing it- saying that she would have been okay with some day facing the choice of leaving him once she had invested potentially years into their relationship, or losing your friendship.\n\nOn top of that, you say she's your best friend and so I'll assume that you guys hang out a lot and/or talk a lot? If that is true, that means that she *actively* kept their dating a secret from you; it wasn't that she just forgot to mention it and it was an accident that you never saw them together or heard about how her day doing xyz *included him*, it's that she intentionally never said anything and made sure that there would never be a situation in which you would see her with your ex.\n\nAnd if it wasn't amicable? Then your \"best friend of 10 years\" chose to date your ex despite the fact that it opened up the potential for someone who was toxic to remain in your life through his relationship with her, and that means she didn't care enough about you or your friendship and chose to risk your safety by dating him. (This is, of course, an entirely hypothetical situation. I don't think the breakup was acrimonious from the way you talk about not minding if they had dated.

It's not only the trust that's broken now, it's the relationship.", "because besties never tell each other who they\u2019re dating \ud83d\ude44", "This is exactly how it feels. I would have been okay with her catching feelings for him and going out with him but I want to take back my ability to choose what to share with her.", "Yeah I don't get all the automatic nta votes. I don't care who dates my ex- they're my ex for a reason.  I'd wonder about their judgement but otherwise have at them lol.", "Doesn't matter, the betrayal of finding out like that and the gaslighting means there isn't a friendship worth saving there.", "Sorry, I am curious. What did you do with her and those traitors you called friends?", "You brain dead man? What isn\u2019t there to comprehend? Her so called friend didn\u2019t tell her she got with her ex. The main thing is she can\u2019t trust her friend anymore because she broke it by getting with her ex and actively avoided telling her because she knew it wasn\u2019t right then tried lying about it. I really don\u2019t know what else to say other then you must be a actual sped if you can\u2019t see the problem here. You just don\u2019t get with your friends exes because they broke up for a reason and it would hurt if the friend brought her ex around when he most likely did something to her.", "She dated him after. No she wasn\u2019t the cause of the breakup. She wasn\u2019t in the country when we were dating. She did date him several months after. She did invite him over less than one week after she bid me farewell when I was flying out of the country for work.", "Nah sorry - if you have shared your feelings about a failing relationship it's not at all acceptable for your friend to have a secret relationship with that person. It's not about a 'code' it's about decency\n\nIf you know you're doing the right thing you don't need to keep it secret", "Me personally, I don\u2019t think dating an ex is bad but I think if you\u2019re really close with the friend, you should tell them out of courtesy not permission. In our case, I was confiding in her my relationship with him and mourned the breakup with her.", "Thanks for your response! \n\nI agree that no one has a right to limit who to date or not. I also believe that she has a right to keep her relationships private. \n\nI do think it was wrong for her to elicit info about him through me post break up even if it wasn\u2019t her intention especially when she decided to date him. \n\nShe explicitly welcomed conversations about him while she was with him and she would start conversations about him. \n\nIf I had known they were going out, I would have chosen not to share certain things as his ex to a girl he\u2019s seeing. I appreciate your take outside the AH and NAH labels \ud83d\ude05", "And her insisting that she\u2019s working on herself, while simultaneously feeling no remorse is proof she\u2019s full of shit.", "Information she could use but very obviously didn't? Wtf.", "Forreal! My bff asked for my blessing to go for a guy I was only *talking* to and had fooled around with once, never mind an actual ex.", "No they dated for 2 months after OP's break up 2 years ago.\n\nRead.", "Agreed, if he love life is so private then why did a third party know enough about it to tell OP. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if that third party assumed OP knew and that's why they mentioned it, either that or they found out OP was kept in the dark by the \"friend\" on purpose and they were trying to do the right thing by OP.\n\nNTA OP, and with a friend like her, who needs enemies. You don't want/need someone in your life who cares so little about you that they would go behind your back and then lie to your face about it, because that is what she did for those 2mths she dated your ex.", "We don\u2019t know that she told. We only know OP found out from a third party - it could be the case OPs ex told a mutual friend.", "Because you don't know if the person was really your friend or just waiting for your SO to be free. You can't be sure that friend wasn't having an affair with the SO before the relationship ended.\n\nTo get with the ex so quickly raises suspicion and ends or erodes trust.", "Dating one friends ex is a coincidence and could probably be looked over but two friends exes right after a break up is just weird.", "Cut her off, I have nothing to do with her or any of them anymore. She then got a job at my workplace and decided to join the same college course as me (I\u2019ve left both and she isn\u2019t at them anymore either), so make of that what you will \ud83e\udd74", "The reason I wouldn\u2019t trust her is because she might have used all your info, past arguments, his likes/dislikes to manipulate him into a relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s just a really shady thing to do.", "Except OP is saying that it wasn't wrong to date their ex, so why do they care whether they were told or not?", "I think the real heart of the issue here is values, and the fact you've realised yours and hers are not aligned and not aligned in a way that completely reshapes the friendship.\n\nFWIW I think it's pretty on the wire to date someone a friend recently broke up with. It happens, but at the very least you have to recognise you're choosing the relationship over the friendship and that the friendship may not survive. In addition, she deceived you. \n\nI do think NTA and she is in the wrong, but more fundamentally I think she's told you that your friendship isn't what you thought it was. She's told you that she doesn't share the same values around honesty and transparency, and that she will behave that way in future. \n\nThis is really not about AHs. This is about the fact I think your friendship is largely over, and that's sad but ok. Like any romantic relationship, someone doesn't have to be the agreed bad guy for it to be over. You just aren't in the same place any more, and it may be time to strengthen friendships with other people who align better with you. Treasure the good times, but recognise friendships sometimes fade.", "I think the real heart of the issue here is values, and the fact you've realised yours and hers are not aligned and not aligned in a way that completely reshapes the friendship.\n\nFWIW I think it's pretty on the wire to date someone a friend recently broke up with.

The friend is gaslighting OP, while feeling zero empathy for why OP feels betrayed.", "The code where I come is that you don't date your mates ex's or anyone they fancy as nobody is worth losing a friend over.", "Even if she had waited for them to break up, imagine all the details about her relationship she heard and tried using to her advantage.\n\nImagine hearing all the things abt the relationship and still think, \"i think it would work out if its me, not her.\" SHAAAADY.", "Okay, then definitely NTA OP.", "She was stalking you!", "I would give you an award if I knew how to. \n\nWe have told each other after our discussion that neither of us is the bad person in our life\u2019s story.", "Same here, long term exes, people they're still hurt by or hang up on, people they fancy, all of it is out of bounds if you're normal. But the town is kinda small and there's slim pickings so sometimes you have to have the conversation.", "Yeah she was weirdly obsessed idk, thankfully she\u2019s out of my life and has no clue where I live/work anymore"]}
