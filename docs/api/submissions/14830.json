Imagine if you had found out at their wedding.", "Your NTA\n\nBut she didn't hide it from you because she didn't know.\n\nShe hid it from you because she knew and felt it was wrong. \n\nJust because she now finds out you wouldn't have cared doesn't change the fact that she intentionally hid dating your ex for 2 years and only said some when someone else outed her.\n\nAnyone who is a decent person would at least ask as a courtesy if you would mind.", "Trust her? Dump her.\n\nShe swooped in right after your break up? Thats why she kept it a secret. Yikes.\n\nNow that you found out, shes gaslighting you abt her therapy too! \n\nDUMP HER. she shady.", "NTA - there\u2019s a nuanced difference between keeping something private and keeping something secret. \n\nFor example, she\u2019s totally fine to keep the exact details of intimate activities to herself. But not telling you she shagged your ex? That\u2019s keeping a secret, and it was likely done because she knew it was wrong. \n\nI don\u2019t think the bro/girl code applies in every situation, but this was definitely a time where she should have been honest with you about sleeping with him. She\u2019s doubling down now because she ashamed of her actions. \n\nYou do not need friends like these, duckling. The world is a very big place filled with cool and kind people - leave this faux-friend behind.", "Was she always private about her love life? If not, then you know it was not about her privacy but the fact that it was your ex boyfriend.\n\nHonestly I would never risk a 10 year friendship over a fling, even if I dint know any code.\n\nShe definitely can chose to tell you or not.\nBut you definitely have the right to not trust her after this.

Don\u2019t just tell her you don\u2019t trust her, CUT THE CORD, let her go. \n\nShe dated your ex, which you told her so much about. She didn\u2019t tell you not because \u201cshe didn\u2019t know\u201d but because she knew it was wrong. If she doesn\u2019t feel any guilt or have any remorse doing that to you, there\u2019s probably things much worse that she could do. \n\nYes, she has the right to privacy, but what about morals?? like what about being a good person??", "NTA, if trust is broken it sounds good to be honest about it to hopefully work out where to go from here", "NTA yes everyone has a right to privacy but you have a relationship with this person and they knew exactly what they were doing keeping it from you.", "Yeah that is some straight up bullshit.  She would have to be living under a rock to not have an idea that you might have feelings about that.

She thinks it's part of her right to be private about her love life.\n\n\nThats right, but i also means she stopped being your friend back then, bc no, you don't own strangers anything but you own your close friends trust and honesty. \n\nShe is playing with you and tries to manipulate you so you don't realize she is using you for whatever suits her at the moment while changing the rules of your friendship on the go. \n\nI don't think your friend is good friendship material. She sounds too selfish to really care about other ppl.", "NTA. Makes you wonder if she wanted your boyfriend when you two were dating.

It goes both ways, you don't owe her anything either.", "NTA. \n\nPrivacy right my ass! She knew it was a betrayal but she wanted to do it anyway so she hid it from you. \n\nShe claims to have worked on herself over the last few years and yet she still didn\u2019t tell you, you found out from someone else.

You have different moral values. \n\nI was part of a friendship group with 4 girls. Me, Ann, Lilly and Zoe. \n\nWhen Ann broke up with her boyfriend of 10 years.

Op can partially take the blame for this happening.. keep your mouth shut to so called friends about your boyfriends/relationships you are setting yourself up for this kind of hurt again. It\u2019s like waving fresh premium meat in-front of a lion. \n\nShe\u2019s not your friend, stop talking to her,block her from all contact and move on.

You have every right to feel how you want to feel, and I can understand how your feeling, because obviously this is upsetting to you, but reality is that your friend can date whosoever she pleases, and not tell you about who she is dating if she feels like it.

I really don't think anyone is in the wrong here.)", "YTA - There is no \u201cgirl code.\u201d There is no \u201cbro code.\u201d Not universal ones.

He was your ex, you weren\u2019t entitled to know anything about his love life at that point. It also wasn\u2019t serious, it only lasted two months.\n\nI think it\u2019s strange that you would be so hung up on something so trivial. Do you still have feelings for the guy?

You guys are spot on tho, There are other specific details that involves the secrecy and privacy of others that allude to me feeling not safe (despite this being a long-standing throwaway account but still I wouldn\u2019t risk sharing specific details for their sake). \n\nEven though it\u2019s old news and I don\u2019t have any feelings towards that ex, and would have been happy for them if they made it work, and am happy for them in their current relationship, and wish them the best, I think that our life rulebooks shape our principles and values and basic courtesies. \n\nImo, I\u2019ve witnessed her have mixed rules for courtesies based on her own justifications for them. So for example, I can\u2019t really tell what her intentions were at the time but she urged me repeatedly to tell my ex about my new relationship before I posted it on social media (even though he\u2019s not on mine). It was before they got together but now looking back, I feel like her urging me and talking to me about it repeatedly is weird. She might have had completely pure intentions about caring about his feelings when he gets informed about my relationship or that she was dying to tell him but wanted it to come from me first. It\u2019s compounded stuff like these that have happened and have continued to happen over the days and years that make me lose trust. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m right to, or that she is in fact not trustworthy.

Yes, i wasnt entitled to know because youre my shady friend. Why hide it from me? Because you dont have enough courage to let me know and deal with my reactions? Or you didnt want to lose my friendship while testing water with my ex?\n\nWhat if that relationship had worked out?", "Thanks for your input. I appreciate the honesty. \n\nThis is why I posted it here. \n\nI thought it was basic courtesies that she and I shared. Clearly, I was wrong. \n\nYou\u2019re right though that there are other things that I can\u2019t share on here. We have no hard feelings atm but I can\u2019t shake feeling like I can\u2019t trust her because I feel like she can get absorbed in her own life and not think about others in the process (which is fine, we\u2019re all human and can be overwhelmed with our own life from time to time)  but it happens so frequently and causes chaos and pain for others (not referring to myself). I don\u2019t trust something like that not happening again and then citing that \u201cshe didn\u2019t know\u201d as justification or defending her actions with other type of reasoning if that makes sense.
