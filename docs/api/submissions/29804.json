We have one child together (2m).\n\nMy wife and I have significantly different incomes. She earns 45k per year working as a store manager while I earn 250k per year as a computer engineer for a big company. For almost of all our marriage, we combined our finances. There was no concept of \"my money\" and \"her money\". Both of our salaries would go into a joint account from which our bills would be paid. Of the money that is left over, some is put a savings account, a college fund for our son, downpayment for a house and the remainder is shared equally between us in our own separate accounts for ourselves.\n\nI usually try to use my share of the money on some stock trades or to grab a beer with a couple of friends. Most of the time, I have around 50% of the money left over. My wife on the other hand blows through the money like no tomorrow. She buys expensive shoes, dresses. Goes to these high end spas and restaurants with her friends. She wasn't like this before we got married and combined finances. I've expressed my concerns to her about spending but she said she has the right to spend her money how she sees fit. She didn't have a lot of luxury growing up so she sees her current spending as catching up for what she didn't have. Since we agreed that we can do what we want with our share of the savings, I dropped the issue. But I told her she's on her own for any discretionary personal expenses that she can't pay for. She said ok and we moved on.\n\nLast month, I got a notification there was a $5000 charge on the credit card for our joint account. I called her up to ask her why she made such a big expense. She told me it was because she bought a new purse from LV. I asked her why she didn't use her own personal credit card. She said she didn't have enough in her personal account. I lost my shit. I told her how dare she take money from our shared finances like that without asking me. She acted like it was no big deal. I hung up and asked my company to redirect my salary to my personal account. I also locked her out of our shared savings account lest she do anything stupid like that again. When she found out she started crying because I don't trust her. I told her I'll trust her when she starts to behave responsibly.\n\nShe has a girls trip planned in January for a friends bachelorette and she can't afford it without my salary so she's now had to work 10 hours extra a week so that she can make that trip. She complained to her family and they started blowing up my phone calling me an asshole for financially abusing her. I told them to stay out of marriage and blocked their numbers. But I'm starting to feel guilty for taking the nuclear option.

She knew the boundaries, she knew the limits, and she still preferenced acquiring a likely tacky looking purse over the stability of finances. She frankly has **absolutely no right** to complain about a lack of trust when she spent 5k willy nilly.\n\n>She complained to her family and they started blowing up my phone calling me an asshole for financially abusing her. I told them to stay out of marriage and blocked their numbers. But I'm starting to feel guilty for taking the nuclear option.\n\nTwo things.\n\n1. This is barely the nuclear option, if at all. The nuclear option would be divorcing her or screaming in her face. This is you deciding that if she can't respect the limits of your shared finances, and if she cannot listen to an ounce of reason without disregarding anything that didn't originate in her own head, than she doesn't get a share of your salary. You had a deal, and she broke it.\n2. This is not financial abuse. She has an income, she has the means to make money. You are not preventing her from maintaining her basic needs, the only thing you're doing is not supplementing her income with yours and allowing her to live beyond her means. If anything, she's financially abusing you through her abuse of shared assets and her emotional blackmail.\n\nI'll also add that involving her family as attack dogs to come after you is an exceedingly badlook. I sincerely hope that isn't the face of your wife in every conflict otherwise **yikes.**", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not financially abusing her, you\u2019re protecting joint money from being blown on garbage like LV bags. If anything, she\u2019s financially abusing you. Instead of working 10 more hours she could always return that bag\u2026 \n\nI wouldn\u2019t trust her either, she\u2019s a liar. \n\nThe person you marry is the most important financial decision of your life. Think about that really hard. She can build you up or tear you down, she\u2019s choosing to tear you down. At minimum, don\u2019t give her access until she can prove she\u2019s responsible and won\u2019t make big, wasteful purchases without telling you. A house is more important than an ugly LV purse.", "NTA, tell her to sell those expensive non essential items for money, I would have been livid if I saw a $5000 purchase for something like that. Purchases that large should be discussed beforehand. I\u2019ve never had a shared bank account, and never will for this reason", "NTA - $5,000 is an astronomical amount for a purse at your current combined income. This suggests she has a problem and you\u2019re actually helping her by showing some tough love.", "NTA\n\n> I asked her why she didn't use her own personal credit card. She said she didn't have enough in her personal account.\n\n#BUT I \\*WANTED\\* IT!", "NTA. But it sounds like you guys could use an intermediary (perhaps a marital counselor or a financial advisor) to get your wife to see sense RE her new spending habits.", "NTA but you two need to sit down for some serious money conversations and reach an agreement on how to manage your financial resources together and set some damn boundaries. How much personal credit card debt does she have?", "I think that if the agreement is that the joint account is for specific expenses, then she's not doing right to use it for discretionary spending, especially since she has a separate account for discretionary spending and you had equally shared money into one for each of you. The problem here is not specifically that she spent a large amount of money, it's that she went against your mutual agreement about how your shared account could be used. Right now she thinks it's ok to spend 5K out of a shared account that's not agreed for that purpose. In a few years it could be 25K. 50K. What's the limit? You'd have no control over how your shared income was spent because she's shown she doesn't respect the agreements she made with you. So actually the potential is that YOU could become the victim of financial abuse, being put into debt that's above your pay-scale because she doesn't respect the agreements she has made with you and because she has the propensity and sense of entitlement to an opulent lifestyle.", "NTA you're treading thin ice if you want to stay married but I cant call you the asshole when your wife is spending money like a drunken sailor on a bunch of luxury goods and services.", "NTA this is not financial abuse. She has a serious spending problem. I would be very concerned that she has significant credit card debt.", "5k for a purse? And she \"needed\" it enough to take it out of shared savings?\n\nMight she have a problem? Something like a shopping equivalent to gambling? An addiction?\n\nBecause that's some deranged spending. NTA.", "NTA - You\u2019d better build those financial boundaries now before she gets worse and her only response is to cry more and further disrespect you in front of her family. She isn\u2019t owed an expensive lifestyle just because she didn\u2019t have it years ago. She\u2019s heavily dependent on your salary instead of being grateful to you. \n\nYou\u2019ve given her the best circumstance possible and she\u2019s still greedy. She sounds like a child who lies and is untrustworthy instead of an mature adult. Having to work some extra hours is a small price to pay. She can take return some of her expensive purchase if she does want to work.", "Anyone who uses $5,000 on a gd purse is the AH of any story. NTA", "ESH. You agreed to let her spend her discretionary money as she wants, so unless you renegotiate that between the two of you, she gets to do what she wants. She's the AH because she spent joint funds on personal things outside of that agreement. YTA because you shut her out of joint finances and significantly cut her off. Neither of you are mature enough to talk this out.", "NTA, she broke your agreement.  She needs therapy to address her spending addiction.  It\u2019s a real problem.  My stepmom bankrupted the family because she couldn\u2019t control it.", "NTA\n\nI was going for a \"but\" imitially, but then reread your post - you already had the talk with her, and yet she bought the purse anyway??  What was her response when you reminded her that you had agreed that things like that had to come from her own means??\n\nAlso - her running to her family and having them call you requires a seperate discussiin with her regarding boundaries towards family.\n\nIf you do not settle this, the resentment it will cause will do long-lasting damage to your relationship, right now youre feeling used and shes feeling abused + humiliated. If these feelings are allowed to fester, the fallout may ultimately lead to the end of your marriage.\n\nRight now your wife has her family and friends in her ears telling her hiw abusive you are... \n\nYou need to speak with her about all this  - and dont wait a month.", "Nta, sounds like she has an exceptionally large amount of discretionary spending money every month and no ability to budget or self control. She needs to work on this, you can\u2019t do it for her. If she was addicted to a substance or gambling no one would suggest you need to enable her, reckless spending is no different.", "The entitlement of just spending $5000 of your joint dollars on a purse is ... appalling. I don't have words for how bad that is. She needs the nuclear option until she learns to act like an adult. And I'd be insisting she pay you back whatever she owes you of the $5,000. How stupid do you have to be to spend >10% of your income on a luxury item? NTA at all, and I wish you luck because this is clearly affecting the relationship. Stay strong and tell her family to mind their own business.", "NTA because you said her spending money goes into a separate account. Your joint account is for bills and sensible things. But if the money had come out of her separate account then she was free to spend it as she likes because that would have been what you agreed. I would make sure free to spend money goes into a different account for both of you though than your joint account. Because otherwise it can seem a bit hypocritical. You don't want to be financially abusing by holding the purse strings tight but need to have a sincere discussion maybe with mediator as others suggested.  \nAlso to take into account if she is doing a lot of the childcare or put her career on hold to have children you don't want to go in too harsh about her lower salary.", "NTA. People who grew up poor sometimes don't understand money. That's patronizing but to her $300K is a lot of money. But it isn't especially with a kid. A five thousand dollar bag isn't a spur of the moment decision for a household with that money.", "Nta. 35yrs old making 45k and still not having a full understanding and appreciation of finances. Some people are just content to throw their solid relationships away for instant gratification. Do you have a prenup? One can only hope", "I firmly believe fully cutting her off is harsh, I would sit down for a family budget meeting, review what is reasonable, and restructure to compensate for the purchase.", "NTA She broke a verbal contract and took advantage of her access to shared money to buy an unnecessary item.  Then you held her accountable to the agreement that anything outside her budget she would have to earn or budget better.  Good luck", "NTA she is totally irresponsible and needs a reality check", "NTA \n\ncouples who live as a unit and split finances should talk before any big purchase. However you both definitely need to clearly communicate how to handle this in a healthier way. And I think getting a third party (licensed therapist) could be really helpful.", "Also, you can\u2019t \u201clock her out\u201d of a joint account. If she is a joint account holder with signature authority, she could walk into the bank tomorrow and empty it without so much as a word. I used to work in banking and saw plenty of wives do just that. She has to agree to be removed from an account and sign paperwork to do so. All she has to do is call the bank, go in person, or create her own login. You can immediately remove her as an authorized holder of a credit card, but not a FDIC backed bank account. You\u2019re legally playing with fire, and you will get burned if you don\u2019t get help.", "ESH - You need to consult a lawyer before she does. She could divorce you and take half, and she\u2019s entitled to it, unless you live in California. Once you hit 10 years, it\u2019s on. Joint money is joint money, and many states can use financial abuse against you in divorce, and what you are doing could absolutely be defined in a legal sense as financial abuse. If you really want to go down that road, consult an attorney and make sure what you\u2019re doing won\u2019t land you in hot water down the line. \n\nShe is a abusing the right to joint funds by lavishly spending it, but it IS a right. It\u2019s not illegal or unheard of with wealthy couples. You have a difference in values. I\u2019d recommend some good financial and marital counseling, but blocking her from legal joint assets is not wise on your part for the long game. She makes 18% of your income. So if you want to make it fair, you pay 82% of all expenses and she pays 18% of all expenses. Can\u2019t really think it\u2019s fair to do a 50/50 split when you make 5.5 times what she does. \n\nYou have a 2m old and make more than enough for her to stay home. What if she were a STAH mom? Would you freeze her out? Give her an allowance? Does she clean your house? Cook your food? Help manage the appointments? That\u2019s work, and your income isn\u2019t just your money legally. \n\nYou could call your bank and set up custom transaction and daily spending limits rather than freeze her out. Most banks limit single transactions and daily spending to mitigate fraud losses, but there are ways to lower the defaults that will decline any transaction over a specific amount. You can set up alerts for purchases more than a certain dollar value too. Call your bank and talk about options! They\u2019ll help. \n\nYou jumped the gun and punished her like a petulant teenager rather than a partner. That makes you an AH, and that\u2019s why ESH. You think a $5K purse is expensive? Just wait until you find out what a divorce will cost you.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s older than you and it\u2019s high time she learns to budget and live within her means. I also don\u2019t see why she needed to get a purse she could not afford. It\u2019s a luxury, not a necessity. Spending 5k on a purse with your joint account is so disrespectful when it\u2019s clear what the joint account is for: paying off joint expenses, not a personal purse from LV! That\u2019s more than what she makes a month! \n\nMost importantly, she said okay to being responsible for overspending. So if I were you, I\u2019ll ask her to repay the 5k to the joint account too. \n\nIf she wants to go on a trip with her friends. That\u2019s her job to save up. Plus honestly, not trying to shame her but if my child was 2yo, I wouldn\u2019t want to be away for too long. Do you have a helper? Who is the main person caring for the kid because if it\u2019s her, then maybe I\u2019ll be a tad more kind and give her some allowance until she pays off the 5k charge to the joint account. \n\nI think she needs to attend classes on how to manage finances though. A student might even have more savings than her. How a grown adult can survive living month to month/pay-check to pay-check is beyond me.", "Jesus Christ. Twelve years ago our finances were so precarious that I verified with my wife that it was OK to spend $25 on a bicycle from a pawn shop for my son. \n\nWe've come so far since then that we own a house and have a nice life. I don't ask her if it's ok to spend some money... but if I spent $5K on something frivolous (or she did) there'd be hell to pay.\n\nNTA", "Working schmuck here.

The divorce was, as of now, the best thing that happened to me.\nIt becomes a path of no way back.", "Her family did not get the same story from her as what you gave here.", "I would say making her work 50 hours is a little harsh. Maybe tell her to save up for the bigger purchases and come to an agreement on how much \u201cfun\u201d money should be allotted each month. Even if it\u2019s you moving money from one account to the other for that month. Next time she wants a $5000 purse she can take her say for example $250 fun money and save it each month towards the purse. If she cant learn to budget that, then definitely keep her far away from the money. Clearly she didn\u2019t take you seriously, but now she knows you\u2019re mad. Let\u2019s see if she learned anything from it. Give her a chance to show you she\u2019s responsible now.", "INFO: You said you ordinarily split expenses, what percent of her income would you say generally goes towards those shared expenses? If it's a super huge amount, or if she has had to in any way hinder her career prospects to raise your child, then ESH.

We have one child together (2m).\n\nMy wife and I have significantly different incomes. She earns 45k per year working as a store manager while I earn 250k per year as a computer engineer for a big company. For almost of all our marriage, we combined our finances. There was no concept of \"my money\" and \"her money\". Both of our salaries would go into a joint account from which our bills would be paid. Of the money that is left over, some is put a savings account, a college fund for our son, downpayment for a house and the remainder is shared equally between us in our own separate accounts for ourselves.\n\nI usually try to use my share of the money on some stock trades or to grab a beer with a couple of friends. Most of the time, I have around 50% of the money left over. My wife on the other hand blows through the money like no tomorrow. She buys expensive shoes, dresses. Goes to these high end spas and restaurants with her friends. She wasn't like this before we got married and combined finances. I've expressed my concerns to her about spending but she said she has the right to spend her money how she sees fit. She didn't have a lot of luxury growing up so she sees her current spending as catching up for what she didn't have. Since we agreed that we can do what we want with our share of the savings, I dropped the issue. But I told her she's on her own for any discretionary personal expenses that she can't pay for. She said ok and we moved on.\n\nLast month, I got a notification there was a $5000 charge on the credit card for our joint account. I called her up to ask her why she made such a big expense. She told me it was because she bought a new purse from LV. I asked her why she didn't use her own personal credit card. She said she didn't have enough in her personal account. I lost my shit. I told her how dare she take money from our shared finances like that without asking me. She acted like it was no big deal. I hung up and asked my company to redirect my salary to my personal account. I also locked her out of our shared savings account lest she do anything stupid like that again. When she found out she started crying because I don't trust her. I told her I'll trust her when she starts to behave responsibly.\n\nShe has a girls trip planned in January for a friends bachelorette and she can't afford it without my salary so she's now had to work 10 hours extra a week so that she can make that trip. She complained to her family and they started blowing up my phone calling me an asshole for financially abusing her. I told them to stay out of marriage and blocked their numbers. But I'm starting to feel guilty for taking the nuclear option. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It seems like it strayed quite a bit from that concept and became a financial war zone.\n\n1. If you\u2019re putting in most of the income, it is a big shock to suddenly cut her off. She did plenty to deserve it, but if you think about it, there was absolutely no way that approach was going to end well.\n\n2. You guys are partners. One partner doesn\u2019t \u201cteach the other a lesson\u201d by disciplining them or suddenly cutting them off. It\u2019s not a parent-child relationship, and if it\u2019s to that point then it\u2019s close to being too late to save the marriage if something doesn\u2019t change.\n\n3. Her spending patterns sound pretty extreme, especially given that it\u2019s a sudden change in her behavior, and she should probably talk to a financial therapist about them. \n\nI think you guys need family counseling. You need to learn basic skills like how to communicate, how to actually hear the other person, how to negotiate, how to express grievances, etc. All of this sounds easy but it\u2019s not. Mind you, I\u2019m not a therapist, just a guy who used to argue about stuff like this and who has been through family counseling before.\n\nShe needs to actually hear and process the distress you feel when money you worked hard to earn, that you are responsibly growing, is being squandered on the most outrageous stuff as soon as you share it.
