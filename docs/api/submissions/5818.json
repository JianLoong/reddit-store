We want to take our relationship to the next level and move in together. I have two daughters (6 & 3) so it makes sense that he would move in with us so we don\u2019t disrupt their lives any more than we have to and keep my oldest in the same school. \n\nMy bf only has one request moving in: that he has an office. His career is very important to him and pays very well. He works from home for an international company so sometimes he has to take calls or meetings outside of normal business hours, so he wants a room where he can have all of his work things together and shut the door and focus. \n\nThe problem is, I live in a 3 bedroom house. It\u2019s not super tiny, but the main living space is all open with no privacy so that is out. I have a basement but that is where the girls\u2019s playroom is and it\u2019s also super dark with practically no natural light (aka too depressing to spend 8+ hours a day in).\n\nThe option that made sense to us was to have the girls share a room. They spend most of their time in the living area or playroom and basically just use their rooms for sleep. They even like to have \u201csleepovers\u201d and share a bed from time to time. My oldest has been talking about wanting a bunk bed for ages, so I thought I could get them a bunk bed and make it fun for them. The room is 9 ft x 12 ft, so not huge, but they won\u2019t be crammed in there.\n\nIt\u2019s not the ideal situation but I believe it\u2019s our best option. If things go well when he moves in, we would like to get married and move to a bigger house in the next few years, before my oldest would need her pre-teen privacy. If it doesn\u2019t go well he\u2019ll move back out and we can go back to prior sleeping arrangements.\n\nI brought this up with family over the holidays and they were really upset.

They said he could work out of the primary bedroom (not very big and I also work from home and need in there sometimes) or go to the basement. Or if it was that big of a deal and he gets paid so well he could add an addition or buy a bigger place. I just think it makes more sense to have the girls get used to living with him in the space they are already comfortable in vs moving in with a new person in a new place all at once. He\u2019s already making a ton of sacrifices to move in with us and I feel like the least we can do is give him the space he needs.\n\nMy girls seemed to like the idea of sharing a room but my family says that they\u2019re too little to really understand what they\u2019re giving up. Would I be the asshole for making them do this??\n\nTL,DR: my boyfriend is moving in and needs an office, the only option is to give him my daughter\u2019s room and make her bunk with her sister for a few years until we would purchase a bigger home.", "created_utc": 1672194914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwxwty/aita_for_making_my_kids_share_a_room_so_my/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should your kids lose out for a man you've known for a year? You are choosing this relationship, the kids are not, and yet they will be the ones losing out so you can benefit. You've no idea how room sharing will go once the novelty wears off and then those kids will be very aware of WHY they have lost out.

Can he rent co-working space or, if privacy is a concern, a studio apartment somewhere he can work out of? Is the basement one in which some remodeling could add enough light to make it serviceable? Could you and he move the main bedroom to the basement and re-configure the bedroom you're currently in as an office for him? Could you and he move to one of your girl's bedrooms as your main bedroom and let your girls share the master if it is larger (perhaps with a room divider)? Is there a walk in closet that can be converted into an office? An attic that can be finished, etc.?\n\nAs someone who works from home and needs a dedicated office space I absolutely get why he needs an office, but I find it hard to believe that the only solution is having your children share a much smaller room if the financial means are truly there. I'm on an entirely remote team. I have coworkers who have done things like convert laundry rooms into an office and move the washer and dryer into a bathroom, who have sound proofed walk-in closets, or who have put up a wall they intend to take down when they resell in a master. Even with a small and not well configured house, it's always easier to add walls then tear them down. I find it hard to believe you can't find a place to make a small room for him with a desk and chair anywhere. \n\nIt's time to go back to the drawing board on this one. There has to be another solution that doesn't impact their lives to this degree.

You have young kids, which means you should really only be moving him in when you're at the point where you are fully committed and ready to be making major commitments like marriage, purchasing joint property, adding an addition, etc. If all of that feels premature then moving in when kids are in the picture is also premature.\n\nIt sounds like the best solution here is for him to keep his house but live at yours. He can drive to his house daily (the same way he'd commute to an office) and drive back at the end of the day. You can also have a dedicated space in the basement at your place or in your bedroom for him for any \"after hours\" work. You can agree to stay out of those places if and when he is taking a call or attending a meeting. If things are working out after a year of living together then you can sell both places and jointly purchase something that meets both of your needs.\n\nIF you're still insistent on the bunk beds plan, consider having your girls share a room for a few months before he moves in. That way they won't associate being displaced with his arrival, any behavioral changes related to the room change will be easy to spot and correctly attribute, and you can see how they actually do on that \"trial\" basis.

If you did, you c/would not assure anyone on behalf of anyone else, especially not someone you met one year ago. I don't understand how you can be so immature at 32 years of age", "So much this. It is not a year and change. Do not uproot the girls from their room. Do NOT move into a new, albeit bigger house (i can\u2019t believe ppl are even suggesting this). He gets the basement or rents an office. Period.", "Yes, mothers make mistakes. But we can\u2019t possibly know the situation and her children better than she does. We can give outside perspectives and advise caution, but we are outside the situation. A lot of the things you are saying are assumptions. And no I wouldn\u2019t blame the mother if she ended up with an abuser, I would blame the abuser. Abusers can be very good at hiding their true nature and there is no magic timeframe where you can know for sure that you know someone well enough. There are many situations where I would say a year is too fast, but it depends on the relationship and we don\u2019t know enough to make that judgement.", "Oh god that\u2019s miserable. Caught between a real rock and hard place there, so to say. I mean would the district  really police it? If you kept up the house and the kids still had their rooms, is the district going to come watch you tuck them in?", "Yes I understand feeling that way. And I think he would be on board with that, it\u2019s me that is hesitant. I was married before to somebody who took commitments like that and used them against me. I know it\u2019s me having trust issues and I\u2019m working on that, but to me I can\u2019t 100% say I want to marry somebody if I haven\u2019t lived with them. I think that\u2019s why even in this situation I\u2019m reassuring myself I\u2019d be okay if it didn\u2019t work. Because not having a backup plan means I\u2019m stuck.", "All of this. I'm super skeptical of the commitment rush here--they haven't even lived together yet! Compatibility is totally different under the same roof 24/7.", "But at the end, you never really \"know\" somebody. Just because you know someone all your life doesn't mean you know for sure if he/she is a predator or not.", "Okay, so because abusers can show their faces after years, why not move him in 3-6 months like she initially wanted to? \ud83d\ude44I can't with you people, logging off", "Not to that extent but then we\u2019d have to pay two mortgages when that money could be going to saving for a house that checks all of the boxes instead of two that check half. Both options are not ideal", "What a pickle. Maybe talk that through with a therapist or couples therapist? It's tough to do the \"we need to move in together so I can see if we can be married\" when you have kids. It's a great decision otherwise, but when you have kids it's very tricky.", "Sounds like maybe wait until you\u2019re damn sure you want to move in for good and bite the bullet then? I mean selling one\u2019s house for a test run of living together seems kind of drastic IMHO.", "We\u2019re 100% in and it wouldn\u2019t be a test run at all. If it doesn\u2019t work out it\u2019s because something went horribly wrong. I\u2019m just a pessimist and I always have to be prepared for worst case scenario lol", "Oh yeah \u201calways be prepared for the worst\u201d is my mindset on everything lol Sounds like you both are ready to buy a house together though so that\u2019s great to hear"]}
