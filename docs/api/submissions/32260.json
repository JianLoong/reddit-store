You both know that\u2019s not realistic. \n\nShe hurt you badly in past and can be forgiven if you choose to & she actually apologizes.

I am also on the autism spectrum. As others have said, it is possible that Amy is genuine and wants to try to make amends. However, if that puts you in a place where your mental health would suffer, you are absolutely, positively NOT obligated to do so. Your first priority is your mental health and physical safety. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you see a therapist, but if you do, it might be good to chat with them about this experience. Therapy has helped me a lot with my anxiety, and helped me to understand how to navigate social situations like this.\n\nAlso, one thing to keep in mind - I understand why you want to get your friends\u2019 opinions, because it can be helpful to get an outsider\u2019s perspective. However, you need to remember that even if your friends have a different perspective, it doesn\u2019t make them *right*. \n\nThe problem with using someone else\u2019s opinions as a basis for a decision is that their opinions are biased. *Biased* does not necessarily mean *bad* - it means their opinions were formed based on *their* prior experiences, beliefs, and values.

Fingers crossed, but CYA just in case!", "Personally I'd probably block her, but if you feel you need to compromise, just message back and say thankyou for recognising the behaviour back then wasn't acceptable but as far as you're concerned it's in the past, and you're not interested in pursuing a friendship going forwards.", "NTA. She probably just wants to feel better about herself rather than kindle a friendship with you. With that \u201capology,\u201d she should be a politician.", "NTA, the only one who decides if something will help you heal is you. She may regret it, but she\u2019s not entitled to anything because of it.", "NTA - she traumatized you. The guilt she carries from how she treated you is on her to deal with. You don\u2019t owe her absolution.", "NTA, you are right. \n\nYou are not obligated to maintain contact with anybody that you knew at school. \n\nNo school bully is entitled to forgiveness from those whose lives they did their utmost to make miserable at school. Regardless of how polite they seem to be now, what they do for a living or how bad their health/finances/family situation now is.", "NTA.\n\nContinue to ignore her, and block her if necessary. In a way, you've already healed by moving on. It's ok to be thrown for a temporary loop when you see your bully years later in a different context, especially when they're being Fake Nice due to work.\n\nAlso \"I didn't treat you as kindly as I could have\" is \\*not\\* an apology or true acceptance of responsibility, thus no forgiveness is necessary. The audacity of her sending a FB friend request. How clueless she remains.\n\nPerhaps high school was the height of your bully's life (which is surprisingly common). She now works in a coffee shop, while you're on the lawyer ladder. \n\nYou. Won.", "NTA. So what if Amy grew into a better person. You do not owe her anything. And how in the hell is friending a bully that traumatized you in school later in life suppose to help you heal? \n\nI'm so sick of people having this idea that victims should forgive their abusers for peace and moving on. Makes me sick when I hear that. Why must the victim always be the bigger person while being victimized and after they recover? Why do you have to look into YOUR heart that was stabbed to give the bully's heart some peace now? \n\nToo many kids suffer from bullying and too many overlook it. Too many kids have literally taken their own lives for people to be out here saying oh give your bully a chance to become a better person and accept their apology decades later. \n\nMy classmate bully would literally destroy my projects I made for class and then laugh. She sent me a friend request 3 days after I graduated HS. Imagine torturing a girl socially for years and then saying that's in the past just a mere 3 days AFTER graduation. \n\nPeople like Amy are so awful. I hate it.", "NTA and Amy was in high school when she bullied you. I doubt she's changed much in the intervening years. No need to have any further contact with her.", "Oh, hell no! I was contacted on social media by some bullies, or people from clique groups that would never have looked at me twice in high school. I kept wondering if they really knew it was me? They were all, \"We're adults now, so we should put the past behind us.\" Yeah, no thanks. She just wants you to forget about everything she did so she can feel better about herself. Do what I do - ignore your bully, and silently wish her lifelong dysentery, with surprise bouts of raging poison ivy before any important public event. Visions like that helped me to heal. (Along with time and distance.) You're already kicking ass by being a lawyer - forget about her and live your life.", "NTA. Fuck that. It\u2019s not going to help you to be friend with someone like that. Just bc she is now regretful doesn\u2019t erase what happened to you.", "NTA.  Saying she didn't treat you as kindly as she could have is a non-apology.  Ignore her request and move on with your life.", "NTA. Bottom line is she made high school hell for you. You don't owe her forgiveness, nor do you need to put up with her. By all means, its possible she's changed. It sounds like life after high school hit her hard. That said, thats not your problem.", "NTA. This will do more for her than it will for you, unsurprising because I don\u2019t think it will do anything for you", "Ignore the bee-atch.", "Folks did this to me after high school. Best to block and ignore. You don't owe them forgiveness.", "NTA- Maybe she does regret it , maybe she has changed, but that doesn't change that you haven't forgotten or forgiven her actions and she has no right to ask or expect forgiveness.\nIt was probably the- if you could forgive me we can be friends, line that makes me view it and her harshly.\nThat's implying you're the problem, not her. \nIf you just forgive her everything is all roses and you'll love her , in spite of everything she did.\n\nDo what is best for you, but I wouldn't accept the request or even respond. Simply because she didn't apologise, at all, or admit to any responsibility or culpability. That says everything, she's not actually sorry for what she did to you, she's sorry it makes her look like a bad person.\nNot treating you kindly as she could ? That's not the words of someone who understands or admits what they did. That's the weasely words of someone trying to minimise  their actions, pretend ' it wasn't that bad', and brush it off what effect it had. \nShe outright bullied you but won't admit it.", "Why on earth does she expect you, to \u201eforgive\u201c her? She should \u201eapologize\u201c and then ask for forgiveness.", "NTA this is about her feeling better for her past actions, not taking responsibility. \n\n\"as kindly as (she) could've\" Are you serious?!

She hasn't changed.", ">A bit after that, I received a message from her that essentially admitted she hadn't treated me \"as kindly as (she) could've\" but that if I could find it in my heart to forgive her, we could be great friends.\n\nShe's minimizing what she did with you.\n\n>They said Amy probably regrets how she acted, and us being friends might help me to heal.\n\nAmy wants this because it will help her.

Donot show your face or contact me again.\" Well, if she has really changed, then it will be her lesson to behave better. You NEVER need to forgive your Bully. She was a kid? You were too.

I'd be very suspicious of this sudden burst of friendliness. Ignore her.", "OP, you are engaging in a healthy behavior called boundaries. You don\u2019t owe her anything.

But as the mother of a young boy who was relentlessly bullied and given death threats at the start of 6th grade by one boy I take this seriously. The school did nothing. We were advocating for our son and I will never forget it took months to get a meeting with his 6th grade team. They did not care and no one from administration even attended. They didn\u2019t care that I had screenshots of death threats, saying the boy was going to kill our son, kill me, kill our lab and gut my son. Break into our house etc. The teachers and school counselor acted put out and rude. We also have a 25 and 22 year old sons so we thought we knew how to parent\n But we sat there stunned that this is what our world has come to. Adults can\u2019t be bothered. Lack of accountability by the parents. Kids unable to have real conversations and interactions. We were finally able to get our son moved to another 6th grade team and tbh they were great and his peers were like minded and he met some really good friends. We put our son into therapy immediately and he was doing better until he wasn\u2019t. He finally broke down in late spring saying he had been saying what the therapist and we wanted to hear. He had used all of his energy to be liked, accepted, smart and funny and he had nothing left in the tank. He was 12 and without hope. He tried to leave this world three times. We were a family in crisis. Finally we were able to find a small facility in a state next to ours. It\u2019s a boarding school combined with therapy, group empowerment and community. He made the decision to go and made all of us promise no matter what he said or did not to let him come home and leave early. He\u2019s our later in life gift. I already knew how hard parenting could be but this was next level. We lived in fear every day and we\u2019re doing everything to ensure he wasn\u2019t the next statistic. Sorry to make this about us but it shows the long term consequences of bullying. You don\u2019t owe that bully anything. Remember if you forgive her it\u2019s only for you to move on but not for her. I would ignore the messages or simply reply that she was awful and you can only hope she\u2019s sincere and will in turn treat others with kindness. You did really well by still getting your coffee and leaving. \n.", ">Do you guys think I'm in the wrong for being stubborn or immature on this?

Maybe.\nBut I would indeed be very suspicious of how sincere she is.", "I'd also say given that OP is a corporate lawyer and Amy is a barista there's probably some ego involved in one direction or the other too. If Amy peeked in high school then either she wants to reclaim that power she felt (i.e. she might be a townie working in a dead end job, but she can still feel better about herself by throwing 'discrete' jabs at the neurodivergent girl) or she realized that all of the bullshit social hierarchy of high school means nothing in the real world and maybe now that OP is doing so well she can help an 'old friend' out (by investing in her MLM or 'putting in a good word' with employers, etc). \n\nThis offer of 'friendship' is super suspect.", ">I appreciate you admitting what you did\n\nBut she didn't.

Nope.\n\nSaying why is was wrong. Nope. \n\nSaying what you will do differently.  Nope.\n\nAsking for forgiveness.

Instead of seeing that there is no strong chance of an upside and a very strong chance of a downside to interacting with Amy, their whole focus is on being nice to Amy.\n\nShare these points with these friends of yours.
