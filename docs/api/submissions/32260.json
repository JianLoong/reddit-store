As a result I was bullied pretty hard during my high school days, and one specific girl (who I'll name Amy) was something of a ringleader in all that.\n\nHer bullying would start with actions like loudly telling me I looked beautiful before bursting into laughter (along with the rest of the class). She would also make me the butt of further jokes by asking me out on behalf of various guy friends, who would often make a face and respond with \"Ew!\" or \"Oh my god Amy no!\". Cue raucous laughter as I tried to pretend I hadn't heard anything. She even pulled my hair sometimes, under the pretence of \"looking at it because it's so curly\". It would really hurt, but since I never fought back in any way, she kept doing it. The most intimidating thing she'd do was far more innocuous. Amy took to staring at me during classes. Just staring at me, because she knew it made me very obviously uncomfortable. But again, I never did a thing to stand up for myself, so I was probably the easiest target she ever had.\n\nNaturally after I left high school I never wanted to see my tormentors again, and for the most part, I haven't. I continued my education, got my degree and have started work as a junior corporate lawyer. As a whole, my life is much better now and I'm truly happy. \n\nRecently, I was in my home town visiting my parents. On the way back, I stopped in a local coffee shop to grab something as I waited for my train. As I approached the counter I was taken aback to see Amy staring back at me. She recognised me immediately, and her reaction was uncharacteristically pleasant, likely on account of her being at work but still, it was jarring to say the least. She said hi, asked me how I was doing and exclaimed it had been so long since she'd seen me. I was still pretty shaken to even be in her presence again, but I gave a few polite answers back. I decided to get my coffee to go and left pretty quickly, and she wished me a good day with a smile. It was amazing how she'd spoken to me with more respect in those two minutes than she ever had through our entire high school days. \n\nI promptly carried on with my life after that, but recently saw that Amy had sent me a Facebook friend request. While our interaction had been nice enough in the caf\u00e9, I still felt like I just didn't want to go there in terms of maintaining contact, so I ignored it. \n\nA bit after that, I received a message from her that essentially admitted she hadn't treated me \"as kindly as (she) could've\" but that if I could find it in my heart to forgive her, we could be great friends. Again I ignored her messages. I told a friend or two about the situation and they said Amy probably regrets how she acted, and us being friends might help me to heal.\n\nDo you guys think I'm in the wrong for being stubborn or immature on this? Is it okay to just not want to be her friend? Any comments would be appreciated.

You are not obliged to offer anything to  someone who bullied and tormented you.

You are not responsible for Amy or Amy\u2019s feelings. She does not get to impact your life now. I have said before that I wouldn\u2019t give the steam off my piss if my former bullies where on fire. They don\u2019t get to feel better by saying sorry or wanting to be friends. Fuck that wtf would someone ever want a friend like that. \n\n\nThe bullies I had growing up impacted my life on how I cope with meeting new people but with support I\u2019ve learned that nothing that they said or did will affect me again.

It's 100% okay to not be her friend. The only person who gets to decide how to move forward here is you, and if you would rather not give her a chance, that's totally fine.

(And you certainly are never under any obligation to forgive her after thinking about it for a second even if she has.)\n\nSecondly, forgiving people doesn't mean being besties with them. It means stopping being angry at them. You can forgive Amy and still never want to talk to her or be friends with her.\n\nNTA. \n\nIt's okay to be stubborn about this.

Would a rape victim want to become friends with their abuser?  Who would recommend this to another?  Those that say you should give her a chance need to think about it as I have stated and see if their opinion changes.

I had bullies in school, and always felt that if I saw them today I would not spit on them if they were on fire.

You get to decide if you want to be Facebook friends with your former bully.  Believe it or not, it may help you heal (I was in the same situation and it helped me) but who it will really help is Amy.", "NTA She is lucky you didn't start calling for a manager or security to have her removed when she approached you. She had a habit of touching your person uninvited. You could rationally have expected her to do it again. It would have been awesome for her to finally see that her actions had consequences and be called out in public. I suppose your anxiety would have prevented you from enjoying it quite as much as it would have deserved to be relished, though.", "NTA , but forgiveness is the only way you are going to move past your bully. I don't mean to suggest being her friend. But consider responding to her. \n\nTell her how much she harmed you succinctly - she doesn't need the whole story. Say you forgive her and accept her apology. But also tell her that in light of your history, you will not be friends with your abuser. Doing this serves you as a form of therapy more than it serves her. \n\nI had the opportunity to do this with an abusive Ex a few years back. It didn't help immediately, but it became an important mechanism for me to move on from it and heal the trauma.", "NTA. Amy got her karma as a coffee shop barista.

Amy could regret her actions and have since grown up to be a better person.  And you can go on with life without needing to be friends with her.  Wish her well or tell her how you feel.  But no, you don't have to absolve her and become her friend.  The best revenge is being happy and living a good life.", "NTA you don\u2019t own her anything! And I don\u2019t think she regrets anything, she just wants to justifying that her behavior wasn\u2019t that bad because you \u201cforgave\u201d her. You don\u2019t have to forgive to move on.

Is it also possible that she hasn't grown up since high school, and wants to make OP the scapegoat again? I would say that in my cynical mindset that is unfortunately the more probable reason.", "She couldn't respect OP not accepting her friend request, she had to push. Also, hadn't treated OP \"as kindly as (she) could've\" is utter BS to minimise her sh*tty behaviour. She has no intention of being a good friend.

It\u2019s basically a \u201cwhoops, I *might\u2019ve* messed up a bit. I\u2019m \u201cadmitting\u201d it whilst not actually admitting it. I\u2019m not fessing up to what I did by saying it outright. We can be good friends if you forgive me tho!!!\u201d.\n\nHonestly Amy should\u2019ve sucked it up. She fucked up big time and she knows it. She might be feeling guilty but she should *actually* admit what she did wrong. Deal in absolutes instead of dancing around the bullying. She *is* (or at least was) a bully to OP. OP also doesn\u2019t owe her a friendship regardless if the apology was sincere or not.\n\nBruh. That\u2019s what\u2019s making me so angry rn. Amy\u2019s asking for forgiveness while also not admitting she was in the wrong\u2026 so what exactly is she doing here? Also the whole friends thing\u2026 she needs to cut it out. Like if her \u201cfriendship\u201d is valuable lol, she was way too old to be bullying. Yes, even in HS. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever come across a bully back when I was in HS lol. Ik everyone\u2019s experience is different, but being a whole ass teen and still bullying is pathetic \ud83d\udc80"]}
