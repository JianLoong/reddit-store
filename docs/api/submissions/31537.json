Since then, she has been divorced, so her surname is different, and I never knew her first name so I had no way of knowing this was her. To say I was mortified is an understatement.

I know that this might be stupid or immature, that it has been 10yrs since I saw her last and I could make small talk for the sake of my father, but I also know that I shall just be uncomfortable the entire time. I had hoped to never see this woman again, and now she is living with my father. I know I should probably grow up and make peace with it, but whenever I think about seeing her I just remember how awful she made me feel for 4yrs as a grieving teenager.

How incredibly immature of that woman to tease a teenager.", "NTA!!\n\n\nYour feelings are valid- a teacher is meant to be trustworthy and a mentor. And for 4 years this woman not only didn't help with the bullying you were going through she participated in it! If she was still a tea her I would honestly report her, because tigers don't change!. Your dad sees the nice lady he's dating, and that's great for him. But for 4 years you dealt with the witchy B. Expecting you to overcome the trauma you went through to make nice is selfish of your father! (Yes I said it) I get that your dad is happy and he wants to spend time with your family. But your feelings are just as important and Christmas under duress with your tormentor spending the entire time pretending she didn't negatively impact your life is not what I would want to endure. Sometimes we need to be a little bit selfish when it comes to our own peace! Protect yours. Your feelings are completely valid and you don't have to play nice with the devil to make the devil and your dad happy. I think though from what you have said about your dad, (being so great) that you have minimized the destruction that was reaped on you during that 4 year period, I feel like you have glossed over and skimmed over it to give him an idea, but not a full true accounting of how extremely atrocious the behaviour you experienced was. Don't be afraid to release all that poison. Tell your dad everything. If he still insists after hearing the truly horrible things that were done, and how badly it affected you, that you attend Christmas. Then go LC with him- I'm sorry , but if your dad doesn't understand your feelings and at least accept them, then why would you trust him with your or your kids peace.? Your dad either accepts this is how you feel, and you may never get over it. But pushing for a big family Christmas party after meeting only once is not the way to pursue a relationship between you and his gf. You may never want to have anything to do with her. And that's completely fine. I don't like when people are told to move on, get over it. No* maybe I don't want to. Maybe remembering helps me make better choices in future, protects me as I grow. Do whats best for you. Your dad will either learn to accept it, or he won't. You are not at fault and definitely NTA\ud83c\udf3b (I'm sorry for all that you went through and for the loss of your mom\ud83c\udf3bx)", "NTA, it\u2019s especially horrible that your father would dare minimise your trauma. \n\n\nI know you love your father and are close with him, but as the old saying goes, when someone shows you who they really are, believe them. He\u2019s made his choice to have someone he knows hurt you in his life and is choosing to keep them and worse still: encourage you to forgive her even when she\u2019s made no effort to apologise. Not that i think a simple apology could ever excuse an adult joining in on bullying a kid. At least other kids have the excuse of still developing in the brain, she has no excuse. I also fear for her kids if she\u2019s so keen on her own appearance. \n\n\nI\u2019m not saying cut contact, but i would begin reassessing the relationship and enforce new boundaries as needed. Let him know you will not tolerate seeing her or minimising of your trauma, that you are hurt by his decision but understand it is his to make. But those decisions come with consequences and as a result you both will need to arrange seperate gatherings.\n\n\nDo not for a second think your trauma isn\u2019t valid, childhood bullying- and even bullying in adults, is incredibly damaging and has taken lives. It is just as valid a trauma as going to war or having a car crash. Do not let him coerce you into doing something for his benefit. Relationships are a two way street, and right how he\u2019s trying to make it about what\u2019s convenient for him, which is completely unfair.", "NTA. Have you point blank told him that this woman actively bullied you, and encouraged the rest of the class to bully you while you were her student?  In no way can that ever be considered an OK thing to do and you don't trust her to be a safe adult for your children to be around.", "NTA He knew who is she is to you. There is a reason he never told you her name and why he never told you he was seeing a former teacher of yours.", "NTA\u2026 your feelings matter but I would warn your dad that this woman made your life hell.

That it\u2019s your responsibility to ensure that you protect yourself and your mental health, for the sake of your children, and allowing your bully into your life is a risk you are unwilling to expose yourself and them too. And furthermore, that your first hand experience over four years is sufficient evidence that she cannot be trusted around children. Especially considering she\u2019s taken zero accountability for her actions. She\u2019s known who you were. She had to see pictures and know your name. She never once made an attempt to contact you and offer a heartfelt apology. To that, I suspect your father must have realized this woman is the one who tormented you in high school", "Nta she bullied and abused you. You're taking the high road here. I would not be so nice myself. I would show up and begin to bring up every instance I can remember of her treatment of me in a funny not really funny way. Example \"Oh, I remember that when I was a kid. It was the day you said so and so to make all my bullies laugh. Remember that?\" But I'm not a nice person soooo....also your dad is a huge ah.

This person whom was a mature adult AND your form tutor was supposed to protect you from this kind of violence... How can your dad be with the woman that bullied you because of your physical and mental state due to your mothers passing?! This is crazy and sounds like it should be a movie plot...

Then for another two years it was less constant but she still singled me out a lot and he knew all about that. I've reminded him about it, send him screenshots of some of our old text conversations about it, but he thinks 10yrs is enough for us all to get over it since I'm not a child anymore. \n\nDefinitely, I don't want her around my children or my partner's daughters.", "He knows, I told him everyday at the time and I have spoken to him multiple times about it recently. He knows what she did but he thinks we should all get over it. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'd much rather not see her at all, even for one conversation. I will definitely try speaking to him about it in person though, I just don't know when that will be. Thank you", "I wouldn't want to be around someone who, *as a grown adult,* not only *actively bullied children,* but also encouraged her other students to do so, and persisted in that appalling behavior over the course of years \u2013 and I would feel that way even if I hadn't been one of her targets, but simply a witness. Her behavior speaks of a fundamental defect in her character so serious that I would never be able to overlook it.\n\nNTA. OP, I don't know what exactly you've said to your father, but you might try adding that she didn't have the (somewhat dubious) excuse of immaturity because she abused her authority to bully children when she was a fully-grown adult. Your father may be able to overlook her obvious cruel streak, or what I suspect is a lack of a functioning conscience, but he simply cannot ask you to do so. She didn't just make a mistake; she persisted in her egregiously cruel behavior over multiple years. Frankly, the fact that your father is so eager to ignore this makes me wonder about his character, because what she has done is something that I think no decent person could ever accept \u2013 I couldn't, even if I didn't know any of the targets of her extended campaigns of bullying, and even less so if my own child had been one of them.", "Thanks for that, I will definitely ask. He never mentioned his partner's profession to me so I don't know how much he knew", "Oh, she knows who you are alright, she just doesn't have the guts to face you because she know that she was in the wrong for what she did.", "> she spent most of the time fussing with her keys.\n\nShe definitely knew who you were because that fussing had to purposes one to hurry your father up and get away from you before 2 she wasn't making eye contact hoping you wouldn't recognise her amd call her out because she knows she screwed up as a kid and doesnt want to risk you putting your father in a place where he might choose you over her which makes me wonder how much she thinks you know about her bullying of you (there could have been worse behind your back that you don't know).", "Rule #2: Double tap.", "It's irrelevant whether you're over it (and you're not, so he has no right to belittle your feelings), **you do not want to give your former abuser the chance to do the same to yours or partners children**.", "I don\u2019t know if it matters to you but I think you are the most mature person in this story. I think the thing you need to accept is not her, it\u2019s your \u201cnew\u201d relationship with your dad. The second your dad picked her your relationship with him changed. He lost your trust and that\u2019s why he lost privileges and rightfully. I understand you want your father in your life so maybe you can go family counseling with your dad if you think it\u2019s worth. If not, just go low contact. Both choices are fine.\n\nAs for grandpa/grandchildren relationships\u2026 It\u2019s not tearing your kids from their grandpa if it involves safety concerns. Your father doesn\u2019t care about your kids as much as he cares about his partner. So it\u2019s not really that important to him having them in his life. Also, \u201ctearing them from grandpa\u201d (with your words, I disagree) is better than your kids going through the same things with you. Right?", "It's not immature. It's consequences for her actions. She's not a safe person for children. The wellbeing of your children is more important than your bully's discomfort and your dad's \"pleasure\". I understand he feels lonely, but I can't understand feeling so lonely to choose your child's bully as a partner.\n\nI have never understood where this obligation to be nice to someone who hurt you comes from. Why would you? You're doing your best to be a kind and considerate person. This takes effort and sometimes sacrifice. Why would you reward other people's bad behaviour? What makes them more important than you?\n\nI'm very sorry about your dad. After losing your mother, this probably feels like another huge loss. I second the suggestion about therapy, as there may be some difficult choices to make. Give your love where it's appreciated, to your family. Good luck! \u2764", "Your dad can continue to ask, you do not have to listen or attend. If your dad knows everything you went through and is still not supporting your valid reasons for not wanting to attend a gathering with her, then I am truly sorry for you\ud83c\udf3b that's not acceptable. You have a right to feel how you feel and not allow anyone in yours or your kids lives that are going to negatively impact your peace. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, and unfortunately, it may be time to put a bit more hard loving on your father and reaffirm your boundaries and hard limits! You don't want to see her, you don't want her to see or interact with your kids, that's your call. He can either accept it or not. And if it's not, then unfortunately you and your kids won't be seeing him. This is not manipulation (when he inevitably uses that line,) this is you protecting your peace and your kids from a known child abuser! Emotional abuse is still abuse! Trust yourself. Be strong! Don't feel guilty! You have nothing to feel guilty of. After all this I've realised that your father has obviously always known who she is and what she did to you and that completely changes how I see him. I would never want to have a relationship with someone who picks/ loves and supports  my/an abuser. From my own side I actually cut my father off a few months ago for continuously and constantly picking his GFS over his kids. The final straw came when he had the audacity to return home after a month visiting us and let us know a few days after, that he was considering getting married (my father is a planner, he would have thought this out for a while before mentioning) meaning he waited until he couldn't speak to us in person to reveal this. This coming after he had already told me he was signing her over the family home (bearing in mind, I paid the mortgage for years and she has never financially contributed to the household, at all!...) All in all- know when to leave what does not bring you peace. I did not need the negativity or constant annoyance in my life. I told him to give her everything and not contact me for anything. I chose Me and my peace \u270c\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udf3b goodluck. I wish you peace \ud83c\udf3b", "NTA. Just tell him that you have decided not to allow this woman in your life and he should get past it. I had a couple of teachers in high school like this. In hindsight they were pathetic losers who were on a power trip and tried to feel better about themselves by bullying a child/preteen. But that doesn't diminish the impact of their bullying. \n\nYour father has sent you a message- he will not protect you or your children from this bully", "NTA - I was bullied as a kid.  I don't care to see any of those people again.   It's been something like 50 years, and I don't think about it or them very much, but there is no way that I want any contact with them.   And I don't have the concern of active bullying against children that you do.\n\nI suggest that you tell your dad that you will not have anything to do with her and her children, and after how she treated you, you don't want any of them around your children, and it's non-negotiable.\n\nIf he wants to see you and your children, he will have to agree to come by himself, and reflect that at least you still love him enough to stay in contact, but he shouldn't push.", "Oh well if he knows and his answer is yo get over it; then he and her can go F@&K themselves and have a great holiday without you"]}
