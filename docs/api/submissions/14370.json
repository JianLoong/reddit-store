Her and her fianc\u00e9 (34f) are very non traditional go with the flow people. We have a brother with two kids (5m and 6f). 5m was asked to be the ring bear. He is in the spectrum and we know that he has tactile issues with some fabrics and the traditional wedding wear would be an issue. Since he loves the soft fabric of his unicorn pajamas, I suggested we find a similar onsie/footy pj that\u2019s a bear. My sister and fianc\u00e9 loved this. 6f is not a girly girl and the only flower girl. She was jealous so my sister found her a similar flower onsie/footy pjs to wear. Sister and fianc\u00e9 got to talking.  There are quite a few little kids coming to the wedding and they know that getting little kids all dressed up can be expensive and a hassle. They care more that everyone is comfortable and having a good time. So their dress code officially changed for all kids- pjs welcome. Adults were already casual formal. Personally I think this is genius. If your kid falls asle on the way home, you can throw them in to bed as is. And if they get cake frosting on themselves, it\u2019s just pajamas, not an expensive dress. \nOur parents lost their minds when they heard this. Sister and fianc\u00e9 have been paying for the wedding so the opinion of our parents has really just been an opinion. Their wedding gift to my sister was paying for the photographer. After hearing about the kids dress code, my parents said that either the kids dress up or they are not paying for the photographer. They don\u2019t want to pay for photos that are not being taken seriously. My sister and her fianc\u00e9 were not yet responding to my parents. They know that it\u2019s their wedding and their choice but they did want to try to keep the peace with my parents. They had suggested compromises and my parents we\u2019re not having it. \nI happen to know a photographer that is amazing and open that weekend. I put down a deposit to reserve them and sending my mother and sister a text. I let them know that I would be more than willing to cover this expenses. Sister could have the wedding they wanted and parents wouldn\u2019t have to pay for a service they were not happy with. I would even pay them back for their photographers fee deposit. Sister and fianc\u00e9 checked out the photographers portfolio and found that their style clicked a lot more. Additionally, they openly supported lgbt rights, where as my mothers choice was clearly uneasy wit it. \nWell now sister, guests and fianc\u00e9 are happy which in my opinion is the most important. Well all guests except my parents and a few relatives. I\u2019ve been bombarded with texts and calls about minding my own business and staying out of it. Truth is normally I do stay out of it.

Therea a few things to really touch on. First your parents picked a photographer who is uncomfortable with LGBT weddings for an LGBT wedding. That ciuld easily ruin the wedding pictures. Unlike all the kids wearing pjs which could be really cute plus like you said is super functional. Second your parents would rather your nephew be so uncomfortable he might have a melt down when he is part of the ceremony than have kids not 'dressed up'. Lastly your parents claimd being uncomfortable spending money for photos that aren't being taken seriously, so you payobg should have been a solution. Obviously not, so the problem is your parents wanted to manipulate your sister into making all the kids less comfortable, especially your nephew, all so the wedding could be ruined by a homophobic photographer that they picked. Makes me wonder if they are mad that the pjs are gonna ruin the wedding because kids aren't dressed up or if they are mad that they can no longer ruin the wedding themselves.

You freaking rock! \n\nAlso, why does your parents think it was a good idea to hire a photographer who is very uneasy with LGBTQ community. I\u2019m not the type to go nuclear, but I probably would\u2019ve done the same thing in your situation. They had some thing to hold over your sister and her fianc\u00e9\u2018s head you took away that ultimatum, and that is the only reason they are upset. The lovely brides have the right to enjoy their wedding as they want.", "NTA. You made suggestions to your sis about the pjs, not a royal decree. She just happened to like it and go with it.

After all, a) this photog is LGBTQ+ friendly, and b) your gifting them this doesn\u2019t come with strings. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you hadn\u2019t stepped in, they may well have ended up without a photog for one of the most special days of their lives. \n\nI wish them the best on their big day and for their future together.", "NTA.
