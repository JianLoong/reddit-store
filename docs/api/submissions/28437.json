Your mother sounds very manipulative.

Your only response to criticism is that she kicked YOU out, has done so repeatedly, and you need a more stable living situation than that. This is not an unreasonable thing for a teen to ask for. \n\nAnd if she and her sister accusing you of \"leaving her,\" maybe tbey need a reminder that you're the kid here, and not a substitute husband or caretaker. It's HER job not to abandon YOU, which is what she's repeatedly done.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother has been mistreating you. In contrast, your father is providing you with a stable and happy home.\n\nChoosing to stay with your father is the right choice for you. \n\nThe fact that your father cheated on your mother, in the past, has no bearing on what you need right now.\n\nI understand how long-standing family dynamics can make you feel like you are responsible for your mother's happiness and well-being, but you aren't.\n\nYou are the child here. She is the parent. \n\nStaying with your father is the best choice for you. At your father's place, you are safe, you are being supported, and you are being given the freedom to be a teenager. \n\nI understand it is difficult to avoid feeling guilty, but you deserve to be happy. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. You're better off away from your emotionaly abbusive mother.", "There is a term for that: Narcissistic Mother.\nFor a minute there, I thought you are the middle child.....\n\nNTA\nStay with your Dad. Focus on Education or career or whatever us your dream and establish your life towards an independent adulthood.\nIf you want to interact with them, you need to maintain space and keep an arm's length, my guess,  it will  only get worse when you go back.", "NTA\n\nYes, your dad cheated, but at least he doesn't abuse his kid.", "NTA, your mom is an adult, and you are not responsible for her feelings. You should not even know that your dad cheated. That's none of your business. Your mom is the asshole for involving you in her relationship and using you as a scapegoat.", "NTA. In no way shape or form. If all is true here, at your young age you\u2019ve already been able to realize that you can not be treated like garbage by anyone. Be proud of that. \n\nYour father cheated and he will have to live with that. Might be a case of horrible husband, great father.\n\nKeep doing what\u2019s best for you!", "NTA guessing your mom is not doing to you what she did to your dad to make him cheat. Some people are just miserable assholes.", "Nta. If you haven't told your dad about the abuse from your mother, now is the time to do so. If your younger siblings are being abused too, he needs to know. Your mother is forcing out a minor, it doesn't show good parenting at best. It may be time to get the courts involved. I suggest not deleting the voice-mails nor the text messages, if they are harassing you like this it will help your dad build a case against your mother in court.", "NTA\n\nYour mum's behaviour as described in your post is abuse, pure and simple.\n\nYour father cheated on your mother, not you, and then your mother turned it into a weapon to control you. She has also done her best to manipulate you in other ways, making everything your fault.\n\nYou're out of this abusive situation. Ask your mum and her family to stop abusing you and, if they don't, block them after ensuring they have the address where they can mail their written apologies if they ever want to have a healthy relationship with you.", "Nta. Don't go back! She is emotionally abusive and manipulative even though you guys love each other.  She kicked you out and specified going to aunties because her sister will agree with everything your mom says and tell you that you were bad even when you were the one being yelled at and blamed for everything.\n\nWhen they contact you and give you a hard time just leave it at \"mother kicked me out, so I figured out my own living situation to stay off of the streets. If I was trying to hurt you guys and be sour I would've just called cps. I am safe, don't worry about me, but I need space from you guys.\"\n\nNow I don't condone cheating. Has your mother always been like this? Do you remember how she treated your father? I am wondering if she treated your father the same way. I've been in an abusive relationship and while you have the great moments the damage is how hurtful they get on the bad moments.\n\n My ex was my best friend, the only one that connected so well, but when things got bad it wasn't good. It's a lot easier to have some sort of relationship with them when you aren't living with them and are the center of aggression and that's why you are questioning if it was as bad as you thought it was when you left. You left for a reason. They were only sorry when you went to someone who wasn't on their side. It's likely that your father was falling out of love due to the same thing for a long time, and then likely met someone who gave him support and encouragement, but he was still too scared to breakup with your mother. It was a bad choice, but I can see where some people fall into that hole. Life is a dirty son of a bitch.", "NTA First unless a child is being detrimental to the household you don\u2019t kick them out. Your mom needs counseling. Once she kicked you out, it was on you where you went. It\u2019s not like she told you to pack some clothes and she dropped you off at your aunts\u2019s house. I would talk to your dad about a more permanent arrangement because the back and forth kicking you out is not healthy for you. You also need to have a serious convo with your mom, not your aunt about how she treats you. Good luck.\n\nEdit: Although it was wrong, your mom could be the reason your dad left. Cheating is not the answer but she sounds like a trip. I\u2019d change the title because his cheating has nothing to do with your situation .", "1. Even without considering your mother's conduct, any question of disobedience on your part by refusing to go to where your mother told you to live is outweighed by your exercise of independent discretion in choosing which parent you want to live with. A stable home is a good thing.\n2. You have an ability to choose what you endorse and do not endorse as your father's legacy to you that your mother does not. I suppose the same is true of your mother. Put what you don't like where it belongs and put what you respect where it belongs.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
