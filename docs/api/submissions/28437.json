If your younger siblings are being abused too, he needs to know. Your mother is forcing out a minor, it doesn't show good parenting at best. It may be time to get the courts involved.

I've been in an abusive relationship and while you have the great moments the damage is how hurtful they get on the bad moments.\n\n My ex was my best friend, the only one that connected so well, but when things got bad it wasn't good. It's a lot easier to have some sort of relationship with them when you aren't living with them and are the center of aggression and that's why you are questioning if it was as bad as you thought it was when you left. You left for a reason. They were only sorry when you went to someone who wasn't on their side. It's likely that your father was falling out of love due to the same thing for a long time, and then likely met someone who gave him support and encouragement, but he was still too scared to breakup with your mother. It was a bad choice, but I can see where some people fall into that hole. Life is a dirty son of a bitch.", "NTA First unless a child is being detrimental to the household you don\u2019t kick them out. Your mom needs counseling. Once she kicked you out, it was on you where you went. It\u2019s not like she told you to pack some clothes and she dropped you off at your aunts\u2019s house. I would talk to your dad about a more permanent arrangement because the back and forth kicking you out is not healthy for you. You also need to have a serious convo with your mom, not your aunt about how she treats you. Good luck.\n\nEdit: Although it was wrong, your mom could be the reason your dad left.

Even without considering your mother's conduct, any question of disobedience on your part by refusing to go to where your mother told you to live is outweighed by your exercise of independent discretion in choosing which parent you want to live with.

My dad is a way better person, I used to think he wasn\u2019t as good as he ACTUALLY is. I don\u2019t care if he cheated, I just cared about the fact I was the one to be blamed for it. And as for my siblings, I want them to come live with me and my dad, until then, idk what\u2019s going to happen", "I completely understand, and hopefully everything works out for you all but I don\u2019t think that courts will allow your siblings to live full time with your dad.  They will take in account if your dad has visited y\u2019all and just face timing is not enough. I would suggest just plain and simple tell your mum to get a therapist and start working on herself and past resentment towards her ex or she will loose all of her kids by this way.  She needs to evaluate if her resentment towards your dad is more important than having her children in her home safe and happy. Granted I do understand why she is bitter and angry, like completely being blindsided by someone who made a wove to you to love and cherish and stuff and then being cheated on dumped with three kids on her own and trying to probably make ends meet while still dealing with separation is not easy.  I would suggest like really suggest for her to find a therapist and maybe one day she can meet a better man than your father who will not cheat and will in turn be a devoted and good husband. Truly hope that everything works out and she stops neglecting you and your sister."]}
