Your wife was nitpicking and arguing not to give your son something he had been promised the night before because she thought there was too much leftover fruit?\n\nESH. You and your wife need to pull it together and not let your disagreements spill onto your children. You *each* independently owe your child a serious apology\n\nAnd if you are looking for advice, it seems pretty clear that your strategy of passive aggressive \"walking away\" isn't working. I don't care whether you have a serious conversation with her, set some boundaries, divvy up the tasks differently, get counseling, etc. but this is clearly not a viable solution and your kids are paying the price.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about pancakes.  It's about things going on in your marriage, which need to be dealt with and resolved.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. You gave her an option. She didn't take it. Alternatively make pancakes for you and your son and tell her that she can have the fruit but you two are having pancakes, and if she doesn't like it then tough cookies!!", "ESH\n\nThis is just a big power struggle for control.

It was breakfast & y\u2019all turned it in to way too much drama. \n\nYou\u2019re both creating problems. No one seems interested in actually solving the problems. Just trying to \u201cteach lessons\u201d & be in charge. It\u2019s totally unnecessary. You\u2019re both adults, the problem was not that challenging to resolve. So far the way you\u2019re both managing this problem hasn\u2019t worked.... perhaps it\u2019s time to do something different.", "NTA but you need to tell her like you did here.

The fact that you've stopped for almost a year before and she still doesn't get it. Then has the nerve to be mad at you. Smh. She needs therapy.", "Should of told her that let this be a lesson to her always butting in 'her way of the highway' spiel.  And then you could make the kid his pancakes.  Why should he suffer for the mistakes of his mother?", "NTA Your wife is weaponizing incompetence and attempting to manipulate you. \n\nPro tip, it\u2019ll probably get a LOT worse, because things/people like this almost never change for the better.", "ESH you're passive aggressive as fuck. Use your words.", "ESH\n\n\nWouldn\u2019t the freaking reasonable thing to do is point out that you don\u2019t have much fruit left and you can add them to the pancakes?\n\n\nMaybe she didn\u2019t realize the other fruit was finished? \n\n\nAlso, you clean up after you cook right?", "I'm torn between a NTA and ESH.  \nYou could benefit from a spine, your relationship from better communication and problem solving.\n\nOn the one hand, yes, it's probably terribly exhausting, having to argue with somebody over every other minute task, plan or decision.  \nOn the other, avoidance will probably lead you to the brink eventually.\n\nIn this particular case, I think you should have just made the pancakes, and not be deterred.  \nIt's difficult to know if this is a good choice for you in general, eo perhaps seek some advice elsewhere, where you can go into more detail about your troubles.", "ESH.

We have had discussions, which usually goes good for about 2-3 months before she slowly starts making her way back, and gets upset I notice, saying that is the way she is, and I shouldn't judge.\n\nAgain I don't mind if she wants tomatoes on her dish, just don't mix it all together with the meal I am cooking, I can literally take a second pot, split it in half, and cooks it with tomatoes. I literally stopped cooking for almost a year cause of that, and she would get upset that I was home for 20 minutes and didn't start making dinner.

That being said, if talking about it isn't working, your current process is okay but not ideal as it is going to fuel frustration for one or both of you. \n\nHighly, suggest talking about it one more time and getting input on what is going to stick for her. Also, she needs to start realizing she can't do it all all the time. She seems a bit tight wound, she may want to explore why. \n\nIn the end, she is concerned about a few fruit going to waste but will destroy a whole meal, or project to have her way?
