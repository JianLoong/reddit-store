He was doing a dance with his legs and clearly uncomfortable.\n\n\nBasically, I hurried to knock on the bathroom door, and told Jo to come out so the parent could use the bathroom, take his kid, and leave. \n\nJo came out looking upset, but I ignored it and told the guy waiting to use it. I figured since she called someone up front to take her spot, she could just wait and use it right after our customer left. That\u2019s what she did.\n\nI thought everything was fine but she confronted me after everyone else had left about being disrespectful towards her and how it upset her to be \u201cthrown out of the bathroom\u201d after she\u2019d been up front for a long time dealing with customers. \n\nI tried to explain I wanted to put the customer first to make us appear better, as well as clear the crowded lobby and get a kid home quicker. I was stressed with how the day had gone previously and apologized, but she still seemed upset with me.\n\nShe told me since she\u2019d been at the company for far longer than me, and because she was much older than me, she deserved respect from me. \n\nI think this may cause tension in the future, because I didn\u2019t know what to say.
