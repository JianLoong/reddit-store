He asked me where my dad is and why he hasn\u2019t seen him and i simply just shrugged my shoulders.\n\nHe huffed and rolled his eyes before he just walked away.\n\nTwo days ago he brought it up again and kept pestering me for information on my dad and I didn\u2019t know how to put it so I just said that I didn\u2019t know and that I was just not in the mood to explain it. \n\nHe started going on about how I was lying and that I kept hiding things from him (I tell him everything) and that I should grow up and get a life instead of hiding meaningless stuff from him. \n\nHe yelled at me for not telling him what was going on and started smashing pictures all around the house, one of them being the one of me and my father when I was younger. \n\nI started crying and told him to stop but he didn\u2019t, he kept yelling before he walked upstairs and started packing his stuff and he just left. \n\nI still haven\u2019t heard anything from him but his family keeps texting me telling me how I\u2019m in the wrong and that I should apologise.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691237964, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15iu9hq/aita_for_not_telling_my_boyfriend_something/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
