We have gotten along decently well with a few disagreements along the way, yet nothing we couldn't fix calmly. Over the past 3-4 months he has expressed dislike for my two cats whom I both adore. I am not yet ready to have kids, but I have always wanted to have something to take care of, so when I adopted my first cat, I was thrilled, and after getting my second cat I was even more ecstatic. I have raised both of my cats from 3 months old and I love them like kids. I would never, ever give them up for anything nor anyone.\n\nWhenever my boyfriend comes over, he gets annoyed whenever they approach him and he has been treating them like they do not exist. I am the type of person who talks to my pets like they are actual people. No, I am not ashamed. Whenever I leave my home, I might say something along the lines of \"Make sure not to make a mess, okay? I wont be long!\" and whenever my cats watch me do something I'll just talk to them as if they can understand me. It may sound stupid, but it has helped me bond with my cats.\n\nA few weeks ago, my boyfriend came over for two weeks and we had a good time aside from when he would make ''jokes'' about my ''crazy cats''. I didn't think much of it at the time, however. A few days after he came to my place, I planned a fun day with my best friends. We went out and I returned at night. Usually my cats come to me as soon as I enter the door, but they didn't, so I got worried and started calling out for them. This resulted in my boyfriend coming out to greet me, looking much more happier. I asked him if he had seen my cats, and that's when he straight up said he had let them outside so they could run off. I was already getting upset but I tried to remain calm and asked him why. That was when he said that he wanted to start a life with me, but knew it would be ''impossible'' with my ''deranged cats in the way'' but he knew I wouldn't want to get rid of them myself so he had to do it for me. I blew up on him and he tried to make it seem like he did nothing wrong. I kicked him out and he drove himself home. Over an hour later I get bombarded with texts saying how I was insane for kicking my BF out over some cats and how it was immature of me to put cats over a human. I feel like I was in the right because these cats mean the world to me, but if multiple people insist I am in the wrong, I need to truly know, AITA?\n\n(NOTE - my cats are now safe and sound at home)\n\n(edit - it wont let me send screenshots on my phone (or maybe in general? not sure) but if i get the chance i will upload them here asap because i do know that something like this CAN be unbelievable so i respect anyones doubts \ud83d\ude0a)", "created_utc": 1667864352, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp4u4z/aita_for_kicking_my_boyfriend_out_for_trying_to/", "score": 310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is just cats, what else is he willing to throw out of your house if he ever gets jealous of your attention to them? Sentimental items? Precious heirlooms? God forbid if anybody has died in your family and you have a picture of them in your house and he throws it out too. This behavior will never be a one off. It's a symptom.\n4.

He thought cats were fine, but never grew up with them or thought much of them. But he was always very pleasant around my cat (I only had one during our relationship) and even happily cat sat for me on occasion, and they had their own friendship when I was away.

That\u2019s the most bizarre part of this, that you\u2019re questioning yourself here\u2026.are you not aware that\u2019s a criminal act that he did? He legit needs to be locked away and certified.
