He's no longer with his son's mom and for the last four years he has been married to his wife Kat. My brother and Kat started dating not long after my nephew started school. At first my nephew seemed to really get along well with Kat and was happy about her presence. But after a few months, during their engagement, I noticed he was more withdrawn and less enthusiastic about Kat and his dad and the wedding. My parents noticed this as well. We asked him if everything was okay and he shrugged it off. My parents brought it up to my brother that they noticed a change and he said things were normal at home and nothing had changed, so it was likely something else, and he'd say something when he wanted to talk.\n\nFour years on and things still felt off. There was always something and we were never sure what it was. My nephew never said anything either. Then a couple of weeks ago my brother mentioned that my nephew was grounded indefinitely at his house and that his ex was refusing to back him up on it. We asked what happened and he said that my nephew had not been acknowledging the presence of Kat in school at all. \n\nWhat started it off with my brother was an assignment where he had to write about his family. He talked about having two homes. How he lived with his mom, maternal grandparents and his uncle, aunt and cousins in one home and he lived with his dad in the other. No mention of Kat living there too. My brother and Kat went into the school and the teacher said she hadn't realized Kat was in the home and that he never mentioned her. Some old work was brought up where my nephew had drawn stuff for art a grade or two ago where he showed himself having two homes but didn't draw Kat while he did draw all the people in the home he shared with his mom.\n\nMy brother confronted my nephew and told him he should have included Kat in all family related writings and drawings and that it was mean of him to talk like she doesn't exist. He asked why he had done it and according to my brother, my nephew said he didn't want to write about her or draw her and that was all he said. So he decided he would be punished for the foreseeable future. No TV, video games, no spending time with his friends, parties, etc.\n\nMy parents and I were shocked by how tough my brother was being. My mom ended up getting a few minutes alone with my nephew who told her that he's expected to think of Kat as his other mom and say he has three parents and he doesn't like that so he found it easier to not say anything, he thought he would be in less trouble.\n\nMy parents decided they were going to talk to my brother and tell them how wrong they felt he was in his decision. I decided to join him and my brother called us all out and said we were ganging up on him like bullies and disrespecting his parenting.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697193361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176vqng/aita_for_joining_my_parents_in_ganging_up_on_my/", "score": 530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mom literally took away all communication devices and locked them in her room or the basement and turn the house alarm on so I couldn\u2019t leave so I was just stuck by myself in the house with no safety measures just to insure I was in that house. The first time I pulled my grades up so I was no longer grounded, the second time my aunt (she\u2019s a cousin but I call her aunt) came in and asked for the phone and I told her every device was locked away she went and cussed my mom tf out.

How\u2019s that sound?\u201d \nSomething like that. Put the ball in his hand and let him pick and chose what he wants to do so long as he\u2019s not nasty about it. If he never does than that\u2019s fine. Not every relationship in peoples lives are meant to be . \n\nRelationships take time and this grounding him bullshit will not, let me repeat, ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT help the situation. It will only build resentment and if he\u2019s like me, he\u2019ll go no contact for a while if not forever. \n\nI talk to my parents now but it took a long time to do so and only on the surface level. Never about my true thoughts/feelings. If my parents were to die tomorrow I\u2019d be sad but after like a week I\u2019d get over it, it\u2019s that bad. Granted my parents also did some other forms of punishment so I can\u2019t say all of it comes from these two extreme groundings but they certainly didn\u2019t help. \n\nKid needs space and a safe place to vent. You as the aunt/uncle should let him no that no matter what you got his back if it\u2019s to talk, just sit in silence, listen to music, or to talk about stupid shit like the weather/tv shoes because in a house like that he probs feels like he has no one and if he\u2019s losing his friends for an indefinite amount of time he\u2019ll truly believe he is alone in the world and those nasty thoughts of finding eternal peace will strike or living on the streets would be better than living there. \n\nPoor kid. I don\u2019t pray but I\u2019m sending good vibes out there for him. Bully the brother some more at this point and let him know his shit don\u2019t smell like roses, get off his high horse, and talk to his son. Not only talk to him but LISTEN to his son. Listen to his thoughts, listen to his feelings, try to understand his point of view. Open up the door so that the kid can walk in at any moment of his choosing. He doesn\u2019t have to be best friends with the kid but the relationship needs to be more than \u201cit\u2019s my way or the highway\u201d \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother has some serious gall calling you a bully when he is right here bullying his own child.", "Your brother is committing emotional abuse.  And he's not listening to reason when it interferes with his agenda.\n\nI think the best way you can help your nephew would be to go to your brother's ex and support her in going to court to alter the custody agreement and get your nephew out of what is clearly a toxic, punitive environment.  \n\nIf she has trouble affording a lawyer, help her find free legal services or offer to help pay.  Do whatever it takes to get your nephew the hell away from your brother and his terrible parenting.  \n\nYou might also call up your nephew's guidance counselor and let them know what's going on so he can get some support at school.\n\nPeople who harm children are worse than A's.  That would be your brother.\n\nYou and your parents are NTA.  Now go take further steps to help your nephew no matter how much it upsets your brother, who is entirely in the wrong.  Your nephew is powerless.  You're not.  Help him!", "NTA, your nephew has no obligation to absolutely love Kat and treat her like this second mom or something. Divorce and remarrying is a hard subject as is, even more so with the kids involved, your brother should probably understand this better and talk to his son more about how he can make this environment more comfortable for him. Punishing him and forcing him to love her will do the exact opposite of what he wants. Also accepting the reality that your nephew might never fully warm up to Kat is also a realistic mindset, sometimes it just doesn\u2019t happen and that\u2019s ok as well.", "NTA.\n\n>So he decided he would be punished for the foreseeable future. No TV, video games, no spending time with his friends, parties, etc\n\nThis is abuse. Your brother is an abuser. He cares more about Kat than his own child, and your nephew knows it.", "NTA and Kat is just your brother's wife and NOT your nephew's other \"mom\". Your brother is a bully. Kat is a bully. And your nephew and only your nephew decides who is his mom and no one else. Your brother is and Kat is.", "Imagine getting grounded for having feelings.", "This is a horrible suggestion! Encouraging the poor kid to spend \u201calone time\u201d with someone he doesn\u2019t acknowledge as family after he\u2019s been punished for it?! \n\nYes, you cannot force a kid to love someone, and having them be alone together is exactly what you\u2019re suggesting!", "Let severely punish the kid for not liking my new wife, surely that would make him like my wife more lol", "This was my first thought as well. Nephew's behavior is a big red flag. SOMETHING is going on with this kid, and someone urgently needs to get to the bottom of it.", "$20 dad is forcing son to try to replace bio mom as revenge for splitting up.  I\u2019ve seen parents do some shitty things to get revenge on the other parent.  \n\nMy parents never divorced, but they should have long before I was even an idea (yeah that bad).  Long story short - Dad always tried to get me on his side about my mom, going on about how terrible she was, everything she did wrong, how poorly she treated him, how controlling she was, etc.  This went on from the time I was 5 until my mom pass (then he wanted sympathy that his wife was gone). All it did was make me resent him even more bc he gave us a lot of other reasons to resent him. He was a mentally and physically abusive alcoholic, controlling, manipulative, and just a not so nice person to anyone in the family.  But outside people - he was charming charismatic, fun, etc. So it was our family secret.  Yeah I kept him at arms length and low contact from the time I was 18 until he passed.", "I wrote this before extra information. I thought it was lack of personal interaction, it was pushing it instead.\n\nIn any case, decisions should be made regarding kids best interests, not peoples egos.\n\nThe kid feels forced to express things he doesnt feel. That is wrong... it doesn't make them horrible people who shouldn't spend time with the kid, it just means they want the reward before participating in the \"competition\". They are skipping steps instead of letting the relationship develop naturally.", "\"I have to make my son miserable because otherwise my new wife won't touch my pee-pee anymore!\"", "Yep!!  My mind immediately went to \u201cwhat TF happened to that kid?\u201d  People don\u2019t change overnight, there is always a cause. As an adult, it\u2019s your job to figure it out for the kid. This child likely doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat and is trying to make the adults in his life happy! \n\nAdd on that the new wife is left out of drawings, a child psychologist would have a field day with it.  Kids don\u2019t know how to process their feelings and it comes out in those sorts of ways.", "One of the first things I ever told my stepson was \"you can call me mom, stepmom, my name, or something else if you're not comfortable with those (as long as it's not disrespectful!) It's your choice, kid.\" He decided stepmom worked for him!\n\nI've also made it clear over the years to him (and his dad) that I am not his parent- I will not parent him. However, I am an adult in this household and should be respected as such. The only time I'm going to step in and \"parent\" is if his dad's not available and it's an unsafe or inappropriate situation. Then I'll discuss what happened with his dad when he's available. \n\nI've also made it very clear too that my family doesn't really do halfs or steps. You're family or you're not. He's my kid. And God help the soul who hurts him- because I WILL go full on Mama Bear quicker than shit.", "No a child should never be punished for this.", "Th red flags are stuck all over the dad who is the one actively hurting his own son.", "Or you're projecting your past onto this scenario.  The kid is being pushed too hard to pretend he feels something he does not.  Why is anybody's guess, but the red flags are shadows from your past.", "Since we are making things up.  I\u2019m going with dad was a Disney dad and rules showed up when stepmom moved in.  And by rules, I mean things like sensible bedtimes, manners, and proper meals.  Son blames the stepmom for party time going away.\n\nOr his mom has engaged in some sweet, sweet alienation against the stepmom."]}
