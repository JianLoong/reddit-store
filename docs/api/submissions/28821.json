He's no longer with his son's mom and for the last four years he has been married to his wife Kat. My brother and Kat started dating not long after my nephew started school. At first my nephew seemed to really get along well with Kat and was happy about her presence. But after a few months, during their engagement, I noticed he was more withdrawn and less enthusiastic about Kat and his dad and the wedding. My parents noticed this as well. We asked him if everything was okay and he shrugged it off. My parents brought it up to my brother that they noticed a change and he said things were normal at home and nothing had changed, so it was likely something else, and he'd say something when he wanted to talk.\n\nFour years on and things still felt off. There was always something and we were never sure what it was. My nephew never said anything either. Then a couple of weeks ago my brother mentioned that my nephew was grounded indefinitely at his house and that his ex was refusing to back him up on it. We asked what happened and he said that my nephew had not been acknowledging the presence of Kat in school at all. \n\nWhat started it off with my brother was an assignment where he had to write about his family. He talked about having two homes. How he lived with his mom, maternal grandparents and his uncle, aunt and cousins in one home and he lived with his dad in the other. No mention of Kat living there too. My brother and Kat went into the school and the teacher said she hadn't realized Kat was in the home and that he never mentioned her. Some old work was brought up where my nephew had drawn stuff for art a grade or two ago where he showed himself having two homes but didn't draw Kat while he did draw all the people in the home he shared with his mom.\n\nMy brother confronted my nephew and told him he should have included Kat in all family related writings and drawings and that it was mean of him to talk like she doesn't exist. He asked why he had done it and according to my brother, my nephew said he didn't want to write about her or draw her and that was all he said. So he decided he would be punished for the foreseeable future. No TV, video games, no spending time with his friends, parties, etc.\n\nMy parents and I were shocked by how tough my brother was being. My mom ended up getting a few minutes alone with my nephew who told her that he's expected to think of Kat as his other mom and say he has three parents and he doesn't like that so he found it easier to not say anything, he thought he would be in less trouble.\n\nMy parents decided they were going to talk to my brother and tell them how wrong they felt he was in his decision. I decided to join him and my brother called us all out and said we were ganging up on him like bullies and disrespecting his parenting.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697193361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176vqng/aita_for_joining_my_parents_in_ganging_up_on_my/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But that conversation should not be about how he decides to discipline his kid. It should be about explaining to him that disciplining him because of personal feelings will most likely make the kid blame Kat for it and make it even harder for that relationship ever be something positive. You cannot force a kid to love someone or talk about them.\n\nThe only solution I see here is to encourage Kat and the kid to spend some alonetime together and make him feel in time that he is cared about not just baggage. He should have friends over while she is at home - hard to deny her existence then. \n\nTo be fair, it doesn't sound like she has made a huge deal of effort to integrate into the kids life.... maybe its just the lack of information in the post.

Someone needs to stick up for your nephew, his parents are neglecting his emotional needs.", "NTA. He needs to get down to the bottom of it, and he\u2019s not gonna do that if he\u2019s punishing him. Either Kat is abusive, or his mom is poisoning his mind about Kat.", "NTA.  I\u2019m gathering from the talk your parents had that your nephew had been \u2018instructed\u2019 PRIOR to this incident ie right out of the gate when he was about 6 to consider/call Kay as his second mom and to always say he has three parents.  He didn\u2019t feel that way, naturally, so thought not including her and needing to label her was best\u2026and they are punishing him for that. \n\nYou definitely need to have a sit down in private with your brother.  Try to get him to see mandating titles and affection will never work, and cause resentment and issues\u2026like it is right now.", "NTA.  Your brother is taking the completely wrong approach by punishing his son for expressing his feelings (outside the home even).

Validate his feelings. And keep trying to talk some sense into your idiot brother.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole. That\u2019s a rough situation for everyone involved, especially the kid. Perhaps the kids mom is saying bad stuff about Kat? You can\u2019t tell for sure but what\u2019s important is that the kid understands that he\u2019s loved and supported by a lot of people. The punishment seems like a real over reaction which will backfire. As a parent we do overreact at times and make mistakes. This would be a great opportunity for his dad to show what adults do when the mess up. We apologize and try to set things right.", "ESH. Don\u2019t get me wrong this needs to be addressed. BUT\u2026how it\u2019s addressed is more important than actually addressing it. You guys hanged up on him instead of coming to him out of concern. You made him double down on his resolve. Had you guys gone to him out of love and concern for his son and the difficulty he was under maybe you could have encouraged your brother to get his son in therapy where he might talk to the therapist and tell what is going on. Are they grounding him for not calling Kat mom? Are they trying to push a relation equal to his mom? What is actually going on there? You\u2019ll never know bc you pissed off the brother.", "NTA - But someone not your brother needs to have a conversation on the drastic change.

In fact it's something your nephew shouldn't even be punished for.  \n\nFrankly if I was the ex I'd be talking to my lawyer about custody.

She can like them and love them and they are her family but that is it.\n\nAnd i had to have this conversation because she is very affectionate and it is hurtful to the actual parents to call nonrelated/non adoptive parents your mom and dad.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, punishing a kid because of definitions is dumb", "Oh, that is going to turn into a shitshow.

Sometimes stepparents can be overwhelming and overbearing in staking their claim to being family. Maybe she is forcing the \"Mom\" thing.

Your brother's punishment of his son is ridiculous!", "No, it sounds like she **has** made a huge deal of effort to integrate into the kid\u2019s life. Too much of a deal in fact. This all began before he started school so most likely 5 years ago and it\u2019s now coming out that it\u2019s because they want Kat to be considered the same as his mom, which considering his mom is active in his life she most definitely is not. \n\nKat and OP\u2019s brother need to take about 10 steps back and actually consider what is good for the kid and not what they want or it is going to destroy their relationship with him.", "OP's brother needs to read some of the posts made by step-children going LC or NC. In so many of them, it's because their birth parent is trying to force them to play perfect happy family with the new step-parent, their own feelings be damned. Whether it's a recent marriage, or a long-term mess that the kid is ready to escape, the adults have only managed to sour any relationship and push the kid away, as if the kid hadn't already had a life pre-step-parent.\n\nOP, your nephew has his own feelings about all of this, and should never be punished for the way he feels--especially when his own life is so out of his own control.

In any case, its not something to punish a kid for in either case.\n\nIn my case it happened after a few days they met, it was clearly too early. And she was 7, not a toddler any more. So it was worth talking about.", "If you haven't been abused you wouldn't see the red flags in this post,  it could be abuse or she's pushed to hard but I feel there is definitely something traumatic here!!!"]}
