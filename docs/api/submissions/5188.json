I did not feel like Ani taking time while he wasn't around was a good compromise to him obtaining 50-50 and a judge agreed, stating since dad would not see the kids during that time, it made sense to keep them with mom (me). Two of my three kids were not super affectionate in general, but were with me and more than once she made comments about rubbing it in her face or using my kids to hurt her, because the kids would not be the same with her. For three or so years we had a very tense dynamic and my ex was useless. I told him he should be doing better as my co-parent but he told me his wife was more of the co-parent now. He eventually left the old job and 50-50 began happening. \n\nOnce 50-50 happened we had some more issues, mostly because she started calling herself their mom and I hated that. My kids have only ever called her Ani and I know they used to say she wasn't their mom. But I admit I was jealous. I also believe that's what she wanted to have happen. I did get it under control because my kids came first. But it was always annoying when she had already gone out of her way to introduce herself to someone as their mom and then there was confusion because they called me mom.\n\nThings sort of calmed over the last three years. We're not close. We're not all one big family. But my kids are safe and looked after and that's what matters to me. I also had them in therapy from a very young age so that helped them a lot.\n\nAni recently learned that she will not be able to have a biological child of her own. She and my ex were trying for years and she suffered three miscarriages in that time. I'm not sure of all the details but I do know this was a blow. They found out the final results of testing last week. My ex told me that he wants the kids to spend more time with them and to be with them for Christmas (I get this year per our CO). He admitted the kids do not want to be there but wanted me to agree anyway, because Ani's feelings and helping her. I told him no. He told me again about Ani's feelings and I told him her feelings were not mine or our kids' problem.

If you were to force them to do something they not only don't have to do, but have already been really clear they don't want to do, it may hurt the relationships they have with you, & there's absolutely no way they'd be gracious company while at their father's house.", "I am sorry for Ani's feelings as I'm sure she is devastated. But I don't see why this makes them ask to change the court order. On the contrary, it seems that if there are strong emotions around, the stability of an established arrangement would be all the more important. As far as I can see, you're NTA here.", "NTA. It\u2019s sad that she can\u2019t have children with your ex. But not your problem, or your children\u2019s problem.", "NTA. My parents divorced when I was 13 and I was forced to spent Christmas every other year with my father\u2019s family, even though I didn\u2019t like me and they would bully me because of the divorce (they blamed my mother and I\u2019m very similar to her). Please, do not make you kids spent the holidays in this messy situation", "NTA your ex husbands wife isn\u2019t a parent to your children. She tried to insert herself as the mother but that simply isn\u2019t the case. Having your children for a prolonged time feels to me like having props to help with Ex\u2019s wife grief which in isn\u2019t coping in a healthy way. It\u2019s sad that she isn\u2019t able to have biological children of her own but your ex and his wife have to cope with this results in their way maturely not trying to cover up pain and lashing out at others. Perhaps it would be better if your children\u2019s time at their fathers home is reduced for a time.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m happy you didn\u2019t react when she went out of her way to make you jealous because at the end of the day your kids are teenagers they know who their mom is. The more your ex and his wife push a closer relationship on them the more the kids will resist. Stepparents who try to force a relationship never get anywhere. With that being said your kids are at an age where they should have a say about who they want to spend time with. The wife not being able to have her own kids isn\u2019t your problem or your kids problem. She needs therapy to help her cope. Her leaning on your kids will just make them not want to be around her because she will be more clingy and \u201cI\u2019m your mom\u201d them to death to deal with her own pain.", "NTA", "NTA Ani need therapy. Children and unwilling adults shouldn\u2019t bear the brunt of her ongoing emotional turmoil, frustration, and jealousy.", "NTA... Ani is a walking red flag. She is narcissistic and expects to replace you as the kids' mother which isn't healthy for anyone. Your ex sounds like he's not even parenting them and is expecting her to play mommy while he lives his life.\n\nThere is no way I would ever give up my holidays with my kids because a step mother asked. And there is no way I'd modify a parenting plan because it could be used against you in the future. Nope, nope, nope. \n\nHer feelings are unimportant in this situation. The kids are the only ones who should have any input. If she wants her own children so much, she should adopt her own. But, I don't think that's a good idea honestly. She can't get past herself.", "NTA - Your kids are only young once and you want to cherish every Christmas that you get, it's understandable and I think your ex and Ani should take a holiday and let the kids do what's going to make them happy.", "NTA You're not keeping the kids from them, you're following an agreement.", "NTA.\n\nYou're following the court order, and the kids don't even want to be with them.\n\nSo that's a twofer in your favor. Your kids are not there to be her emotional support.  That's your ex's job.", "NTA not your feelings not your problem! Not your kids feelings not your kids problem! People need to stop depending on others to make them feel better all the time and learn how to regulate their own emotions without trying to make kids be their parent! The kids do not want to be there for Christmas and if you don't want to make them don't! She is not their mother and she has no legal rights to those kids only he does! Quite frankly, this is the time they need to spend alone healing instead of using your children as a replacement of her not having any of her own! It's sad that she can't have children and I do hate that for her since she wants them, but at the end of the day that's between them!", "NTA. She is their step mother because she married their father not because they chose her. She is trying to force a relationship they don't want and your ex is complicit.", "Definitely NTA. It's not yours, or the kids responsibility to take care of STEP mom's feelings.", "NTA. What is it with people thinking that marrying a parent automatically makes them a parent figure to the stepchildren? This kind of relationship is earned, and sometimes it just never works out. By forcing the issue, she got the opposite of what she expected. I am sorry for her losses and the diagnosis, it must be devastating, but it is absolutely not your children's role to fill the void.", "NTA. As someone who comes from a divorced family and who has had their fair share of step parents and SO\u2019s (trying to be parents) come through, Ani sounds like the kind of overstepping stepmom I would hate. Her calling herself the mom of your kids is definitely not okay. She is not entitled to be in your kids life she is lucky enough to get to be, but it isn\u2019t about her. She needs to learn to respect boundaries with you and your kids.", "Nta. She is an adult who needs to sorry through her own feelings. I say this as a woman who has had a few miscarriages myself.\nThe children cannot be burdened with making her happy etc. \nAlso it is your court ordered time with the kids. It's important to keep things normal for the kids.", "Unless someone is dying there's no reason to force you to be alone for three Christmases in a row. That's simply cruel. You're their mother, and *you* will be hurting when you can't spend Christmas with them for that long. She might love them, but it seems like she's trying to bandage her infertility trauma with being a \"mom\" step-mom, instead of wanting the best for them. NTA", "NTA. Nope sir, those kids are Kids, they are Not emotional support animals.", "NTA OP!!! Ani sounds insufferable. Forcing her perceived status on the kids is horrible. She probably did more damage to their relationship by trying to force them to see her as their mom. Your ex-husband is on the wrong side and should be advocating for whatever makes the kids comfortable and happy. Thankfully, you have them in therapy cause Ani is.... a lot. You're an amazing mom for standing your ground and supporting your kids.", "NTA \n\nDo not deviate from your agreement or CO. If you give an inch now, they\u2019ll try to take a mile in the future.\n\nKeep it to a T.\n\nAnd no, NTA for saying that.", "NTA and you are 100% right. Ani is NOT a parent. NOT. \n\nYou are doing this all correctly, including therapy. I would suggest that you see if your oldest has the legal right to express their wishes on this matter. And I would also suggest that you consult with the therapist and request a report from him/her about this matter.", "You stuck to doing the correct thing according to your court order. Is that the right thing? Did you even think of discussing it with your kids? Did you consider a compromise? You still have emotional baggage and you might be using your kids as emotional bargaining chips. Only you know for sure.", "Why don't you split Christmas? Christmas with one, Christmas Eve with the other. Set an example of compromise for your kids And yes, YTA for saying that. It will be in your and your kid's best interest to be kind to Ani", "Agreed. Ani needs therapy, not treat the kids as emotional support animals. Besides, the more she forces them to be with her, the greater are the chances of them cutting her out the second they turn 18.", "I think it\u2019s also important to follow the court custody agreement. I could easily see her letting the kids be with them for Christmas this year (her year) and then next year them still saying \u201cwell according to the court it\u2019s our year\u201d", "NTA. Definitely. I liked what you said.", "I think I would go nuclear if a step parent ever tried to claim equal parenting rights or wanted my kids to call her \u2018mum\u2019. I agreed to have kids with one person, their dad. Any person who goes into a relationship with a single parent needs to understand they\u2019re never going to be a full parent to those kids. If they play their cards right and don\u2019t force the issue they might end up a beloved parental figure, which is not the same as a parent, but that\u2019s like the difference between someone understanding they might get nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and not Best Actor because they just weren\u2019t in the movie enough to qualify for the latter. \n\nRight now my ex\u2019s gf has been in the scene for 2.5 years and still seems to be \u201cfriendly known adult who will sometimes retrieve juice boxes\u201d, she\u2019s not stepped into any role of responsibility beyond that. I\u2019m not particularly bothered if she does take more responsibility in future as something like \u201ctrusted adult the kids can be left with sometimes\u201d but it\u2019s honestly a relief that her absolutely glacial progression with my kids indicates she won\u2019t be expecting them to call her mum anytime soon. Good for her.", "The kids ready stated they do not want to spend Christmas with Ani.", "> Is that the right thing? \n\nThe right thing will be to give the children as emotional support pets against their wishes and against custody agreement?\n\nSure. You have a lot of strong morals.", "I did not discuss it with my kids or consider a compromise because my ex already had spoken to them and was aware they did not want to go. If he was able to admit it then I knew saying no was the right thing. I will not force my kids to be there more than they are ordered to be.", "If you read the post, you would know the children don't want to be at Dads.", "This so much. It sounds like Ani has been boundary stomping from day one. It is in no way OP\u2019s kids\u2019 responsibility to perform like good little consolation prizes.", "This comment summarises every thing in a nut shell", "I mean even an animal, like a dog or a cat, if you try to force affection on them, they'll hate you.  You have to respect the autonomy of any living thing and earn the relationship.\n\nSounds like Ani basically acted like someone trying to cuddle a cat that's trying to escape.  Doesn't make the cat want to come sit with you in the future.\n\nSame thing with the kids.  By trying to force them to see her as mom, she made it so they're uncomfortable with her.", "I cannot see them using the time for that. Though I think it could only be a good thing if they did.", "Honest question: What kind of decisions would need to be made or changed because the step mom cannot have bio kids? I\u2019m not fully following your line of thought here.", "Thanks. Best thing I did for me!", "Have they managed to avoid calling her Mom?\n\nNTA of course", "I'll sound awful rn but is good that someone as unsuitable for parenthood as her can't have kids, even a bio child would be under constant pressure and emotional burden from her....", "i can imagine if she does ever end up having a child of her own she will suddenly not care much about your kids anymore. She only wants them now because shes jealous of what you have.", "I fully agree, but this comment is ironic to me, as I walked through a mall yesterday and they had an ad of foster children on the wall ...", "Yes! And her boundary stomping is likely why the kids prefer to be with OP.\nIt\u2019s ironic that the ex is saying that Ani\u2019s feelings are the kids\u2019 problem while they in turn clearly don\u2019t care about the kids\u2019 true feelings,\nNTA. At least one of the parents listens to them.", "Whether to look into adoption/fertility, what to do with all this money they\u2019d otherwise have spent on kids (if there is any), what the new life-goals are going to look like, how/where to express the nurturing/caring side of their personality (eg volunteering with kids?) if that\u2019s important to them.", "They have never called her mom. That was a complaint Ani had for me before. Like I was going to be outraged by that.", "As a point of clarification, being not adoptable doesn\u2019t seem to be referring to their character, but rather to the fact that just because they are currently in the foster care system does not mean they are available to be adopted.", "The ex husband and his wife were dealt a severe blow and are still processing it. I am concerned their \"process\" could be damaging to the children. Look at this Christmas request. It shows that neither of them understand the reality of their situation. The ex said his wife is a parent. She is family. Is she? The kids decide that not him. \n\nBased on what OP shared the kids decided Ani is their father's wife not their mom. I read somewhere it takes years for a child to see a stepparent as a parental figure. If the person entered the child's life when they were 4, then it would take roughly 4 years for the child to see the new person as a parent. And so on. However, there comes an age where that bond never happens. These kids are teenagers. That ship has sailed.\n\nMy fear is this will *always* be a thing. She's going to want to be the mother of the bride or groom. She's going to want their kids to call her grandma. It doesn't have to be today but at some point someone is going to have to explain boundaries to her. What's sad is Ani could have a healthy relationship with the children if she and her husband (he's at fault too) would stop trying to force it.", "Kids who were sexually assaulted, murder in the family , or a myriad of other tragic things are not \u201creunification is always the goal\u201d.  I tried to phrase it nicely.\n\nEdit,  you\u2019ve commented twice to tell me how wrong I am. That\u2019s enough"]}
