I did not feel like Ani taking time while he wasn't around was a good compromise to him obtaining 50-50 and a judge agreed, stating since dad would not see the kids during that time, it made sense to keep them with mom (me). Two of my three kids were not super affectionate in general, but were with me and more than once she made comments about rubbing it in her face or using my kids to hurt her, because the kids would not be the same with her. For three or so years we had a very tense dynamic and my ex was useless. I told him he should be doing better as my co-parent but he told me his wife was more of the co-parent now. He eventually left the old job and 50-50 began happening. \n\nOnce 50-50 happened we had some more issues, mostly because she started calling herself their mom and I hated that. My kids have only ever called her Ani and I know they used to say she wasn't their mom. But I admit I was jealous. I also believe that's what she wanted to have happen. I did get it under control because my kids came first. But it was always annoying when she had already gone out of her way to introduce herself to someone as their mom and then there was confusion because they called me mom.\n\nThings sort of calmed over the last three years. We're not close. We're not all one big family. But my kids are safe and looked after and that's what matters to me. I also had them in therapy from a very young age so that helped them a lot.\n\nAni recently learned that she will not be able to have a biological child of her own. She and my ex were trying for years and she suffered three miscarriages in that time. I'm not sure of all the details but I do know this was a blow. They found out the final results of testing last week. My ex told me that he wants the kids to spend more time with them and to be with them for Christmas (I get this year per our CO). He admitted the kids do not want to be there but wanted me to agree anyway, because Ani's feelings and helping her. I told him no. He told me again about Ani's feelings and I told him her feelings were not mine or our kids' problem.

The kids are old enough to make their own decisions on where to spend Christmas.  If she doesn't like it, then she knows where she stands.  You can not force those feelings on someone.  It doesn't work like that.", "CO-PARENT here. NTA and watch out. You said you marry too young, I'm assuming you're still very young (less than 40 surely) and your ex found an imature woman to marry. \nMy ex has a GF who is very young, but he put his rules on the table from the very beginning (she's 24 or something, were 12 years older than her). He told her I'm tje mom and I'm ALWAYS in the picture because my relationship with my in laws is solid and we get along pretty well, we share all sorts of events \"big happy family\" way, this family is very protective of children so they make everything to make a good childhood for them, they're not spoiled, they work on their school and their house chores and they have to clean after themselves but we all agree that us, adults, have to do better for them. It has meant (along the years) that our issues or big events (divorces, movings, losses, births, etc) are our responsibility and if we need therapy or anything to solve it WITHOUT affecting the kids we will do so. \nNow, his GF was not very fond of this at the beginning but my ex made it very clear that his daughter is priority and since she's used to our dynamics we won't change it until she's older to make some choices. Eventually she was alright, she noticed that my in laws were building a relationship with her, that I want nothing to do with my ex, that but especially: SHE SAW that I mever interrupted the relationship she's building with my child. She was aware i kept and eye very open (my child lives with her dad because of my job and we have open custody, she spends as much time as she wants with either of us, obviously respecting school schedule and such) and she has always been good to her (my ex wouldn't have it any other way), so after a while and realizing my baby is not such a little gullible child anymore, I was also more relaxed, and yes ..i understand the feeling of jealousy as well, very human. And yes, we have to get over it because you know: kids. my daughter, now 12, asked me a few times if it was ok to do \"x\" or \"y\" with her and I said: sure!. I told her that her relationship with Ani (her step mom, sorry for copying, made it easy) is hers and she will learn from every encounter and relationship she builds and I'm always here to catch her or back her up when needed. They get along well but i now that no one can replace me, even when she spends more time with my child, I los my mom when I was a child and my grandma was more than I could have ever ask for, my aunties as well; NONE of them could replace my mom, never, and I know the feeling, that's how I know my spot in my daughter's hear is mine and mine only. They have some things they enjoy to do (they're more of a dancing team and shopping) and we enjoyed our things, we like books and painting and camping (I hate shopping). \nNow, your ex need to prioritize his children. SHE CAN NEVER BE MOM to your children and forcing them is going to make them resentful n the long run. People tendon to assume children as little ornaments in the house, they don't feel, they don't pay attention, they don't really know what's going on... WRONG!! Kids are very aware and they're not dumb, they grow and they can tell they've been manipulated, coerced, forced or pushed to do something, what they do? They rebel because...humans! It's out nature? Why do we take away rights from children, that we give to any othwr adult? The right to build relationships, the right to have an opinion and feelings?? They're not here to please us, WE brought them here out of our own will, the least we could do is to give them basi right all humans deserve, having feelings is amongst the basi ones but somehow children do not have that privilege, adults are always telling them what to feel (don't cry; smile; hug that person; you can't talk like that, you are selfish, etc etc etc). \nIs very imature from the step mom to demand love when they cannot be demanded. She can build the relationship with them and forcing them to call her \"mom\" is going to make them distance even more when they grow. The \"I'm the mom\" thing....they notice, they're quiet but they notice and when they're old enough to speak up for themselves they will say it out loud and she will be hurt and you will be blamed. She (stepmom) needs therapy URGENTLY and your ex, because he's to tangled in his marriage drama to see the bigger picture. He's suffering a frustrated wife who can't be a mom, he wants to solve it ASAP because his home is uncomfortable now, the easiest way is to \"make everyone cooperate\", he's not even thinking about the consequences which I already mentioned, he's looking for a quick fix and a \"happy wife happy life\". Don't be surprised he starts asking for custody or asks to have at least one kid to move with her because poor Any can't have babies. \nFind a professional who can talk to ALL OF YOU 3 ADULTS about what you're not seeing, so and outsider can tell you all in your faces what's missing, want needs to be fixed and where to begin, that has an important impact and she need to see where's her fault. \nIf you let go of Christmas he'll ask more and more because steps mom want it as well DON'T DO IT WITHOUT PAPERWORK AND PROFESSIONALS PRESENT, he said something scary: \"they don't want to but wants you to approve anyway\"..so...he is willing to take away his children's right to have their own feelings (basic human right) so he can d*uck his wife peacefully? (That's the whole problem, he is having a troublesome home, he's not getting any and he wants a quick fix no matter who falls on the way) DON'T DO IT. You're not TA and they need therapy, his wife needs therapy before it gets ugly, and it will get ugly Because everything you brush underneath the rug piles up until it explodes. She can become a danger to your children if she doesn't seek help, she's a mourning mother without the proper care, she'll be mourning her unborn hypothetical children until it becomes unbearable and it will backfire on her, on your ex Wich in turn will make it affect you and your kids. \nWe're all broken, we just need to admit it and take the necessary steps to fix it.

And despite the genuinely awful experiences that occurred before Ani was told that she couldn't have children of her own, that doesn't give her and your ex any right to pressure you into sending the kids to them and then verbally abusing you with insults and derogatory names after you refuse.
