I did not feel like Ani taking time while he wasn't around was a good compromise to him obtaining 50-50 and a judge agreed, stating since dad would not see the kids during that time, it made sense to keep them with mom (me). Two of my three kids were not super affectionate in general, but were with me and more than once she made comments about rubbing it in her face or using my kids to hurt her, because the kids would not be the same with her. For three or so years we had a very tense dynamic and my ex was useless. I told him he should be doing better as my co-parent but he told me his wife was more of the co-parent now. He eventually left the old job and 50-50 began happening. \n\nOnce 50-50 happened we had some more issues, mostly because she started calling herself their mom and I hated that. My kids have only ever called her Ani and I know they used to say she wasn't their mom. But I admit I was jealous. I also believe that's what she wanted to have happen. I did get it under control because my kids came first. But it was always annoying when she had already gone out of her way to introduce herself to someone as their mom and then there was confusion because they called me mom.\n\nThings sort of calmed over the last three years. We're not close. We're not all one big family. But my kids are safe and looked after and that's what matters to me. I also had them in therapy from a very young age so that helped them a lot.\n\nAni recently learned that she will not be able to have a biological child of her own. She and my ex were trying for years and she suffered three miscarriages in that time. I'm not sure of all the details but I do know this was a blow. They found out the final results of testing last week. My ex told me that he wants the kids to spend more time with them and to be with them for Christmas (I get this year per our CO). He admitted the kids do not want to be there but wanted me to agree anyway, because Ani's feelings and helping her. I told him no. He told me again about Ani's feelings and I told him her feelings were not mine or our kids' problem.

NTA", "This sounds like she is emotionally abusive to your children.  Yikes.", "they shouldn\u2019t make them decide but if they independently say \u201ci don\u2019t want to spend christmas with her\u201d their wishes should be respected", "If she actually loved those kids, she'd care about their feelings and perspective.  She would care about you as someone they love and as their mother.\n\nWhat she is feeling is possession and attachment.", "_\"Two of my three kids were not super affectionate in general, but were with me and more than once she made comments about rubbing it in her face or using my kids to hurt her, because the kids would not be the same with her.\"_\n\nYou literally birthed these babies from your body and have been there from the moment they were born. She is simply their dad's wife. How does she expect to have the exact same relationship with them?", "But the kids are of age to express a preference. The 15  year old at least. You can request a hearing for your child to speak to the judge.", "Would it be possible for the court to order counseling to them (Ani and your ex)?", "Reading compression is key lol so I agree with u", "Can you come teach my mom this? Both my mom and my partners mom really struggle with this and it makes visiting and the holidays stressful! Sometimes I want to tell them to count themselves lucky cause while my partner and i live far away our families are 45mins from from each other so we can split a holiday/vacation down the middle but it still feels like someone is always complaining that we arent spending enough time with them. It becomes very stressful.", "One of my cats was so scared when she came to live with us, she spent all her time hiding under the sofa.\n\nI spent hours, literally, lying on the floor with my hand under the sofa so she could see me, and smell me, and get used to me. My wife thought I was nuts. What I DIDN\u2019T do was force cuddles or unwanted contact. One day she came and sat on my lap and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to move (I was late to work that day\u2026)\n\nAnd now she absolutely adores me! I have to put my shoes on standing up when I need to go out, because if I sit down for two minutes, there she is, sitting on me!\n\nI followed pretty much the same concept with my stepson, and that seems to have worked too, except that he rarely hid under the sofa", "You do not sound awful. It is true. While people choose to have kids for their own reasons, expecting them to fulfil emotional needs is a set-up for a bad situation. \n\nShe already has unrealistic expectations of her step children. If she has her own, the potential for harm to that child is a concern.", "Not awful, my adoptive mother did this exact thing to me. She still does and I\u2019m 36. It\u2019s awful.", "Stop talking about my mom like that. If we were TV babies that were smart and cute and not monsters that cried no matter what she did, and she did everything, gave up everything you understand\u2026", "If the CO says they spend Christmas with her and Dad, then that should be respected unless there is a very, very good reason to break that (eg abuse, neglect).", "imo op shoud try and get full custody of her children because op's ex clearly is neglecting the agreement and not being the parent.", "I wish I could.  My mom is weird.  She'll set a time for a holiday and then if someone doesn't like it, she'll change it, and not tell anyone else.  So we all get confused.  It absolutely ruined Thanksgiving. I ended up staying at home and taking a nap after brunch with my husband's family.  It was amazingly restful", "We had a skittish shelter dog that we all broke through to by just laying a couple feet from him. It's so special when they finally start to trust you.", "I think it does matter if the kids want to be returned or not.  I know a little boy who is in foster care.  I don\u2019t know any of the details about why he and his baby sister are in foster care though.  He told me he had \u201crun away from him\u201d but I told him \u201cNo you are just staying with Mrs. S and Mr. G for a little while\u201d.  He then asked if he would go back home and I told him I hope he did.  The next part broke my heart because he said he never wanted to go back there ever again.  I don\u2019t know what happened but this little boy is only 6 and most 6 year olds want to be with their Mom and Dad.", "the CO says that opposite of that anyway so it\u2019s kind of a moot point", "I imagine she won't until her youngest is old enough to be listened to in court.  I don't think it'd be fair to leave the younger/youngest to deal with the fall out of the oldest/older getting to reduce their time.\n\nI reckon dad's gonna be *shocked* when the kids ghost hin after the youngest is 18.", "My partner and I tried to say we were gunna spend xmas with my fam and come over early boxing day here cause that's what did last year only reverse the families around. And then she had a tantrum about my partner not being here Christmas day so the only compromise to make everyone \"happy\" is that I go spend Christmas with my family and he spends Christmas with his and someone drives him over on the 27th. The cherry on top of the cake is that his fam keeps talking about how his sisters future mil is a \"boundary stomper\" I just sit there and nod and say \"yikes\"  I wish I could just eat brunch and take a nap. That sounds like a good day.", "yes it is! especially after spending a ton of time trying to get there. makes you feel almost accomplished and special. that bond with an animal is like no other", "The vast majority of kids in foster care are there essentially because their parents are poor, not because they are abused or assaulted. You should read Torn Apart by Dorothy Roberts to learn more about the foster care system and how it's used to break up families in vulnerable communities, especially black families.", "And his wife will completely have a nervous breakdown because she clearly hasn't looked into therapy to start to deal with that trauma.\n\nAnd both of them will deserve it because they're pushing so hard on the kids boundaries.", "It was great day! And the next day, I went out for steak with who ever wanted to join, my treat.  We had fun, had great food, and I was well rested.  I counted it a win.", "That does sou d like fun! I want that but our moms just gotta be like no, spend time with ME.", "my mom is the exact same. i\u2019m only 20, so idk if you want my advice, but i\u2019ve lived a full life and my mom has kinda mostly stopped. you gotta stand up for yourself at some point. she\u2019s never going to stop until you make her. wish you the best xx"]}
