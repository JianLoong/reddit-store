I\u2019m not sure why now that I think about it, they\u2019re very similar sayings.", "I\u2019m so confused as to why you\u2019re getting downvoted so hard for this harmless comment. That expression definitely can be used in a positive way. And you\u2019re agreeing that in this case it was not positive. You\u2019re completely right lol", "The downvotes tell a lot about people here", "Everyone who has commented saying that it CAN be used in a positive way is being downvoted and I\u2019m so confused\ud83d\ude02 like you\u2019re right, even tho in this case it\u2019s a negative connotation, it\u2019s possible for it to be used positively", "Having morals is fine, but when it leads to you judging friends you\u2019ve known more than half your life and extends to judging their child, then it\u2019s excessive. OP needs to learn how to say \u201cto each their own\u201d or accept that they might lose friends over it.", "Fuckin hell that is super creepy holy shit. I can\u2019t imagine my parents\u2019 friends checking on my or my sister\u2019s social media. That\u2019s fucking wild.", "Sounds like OP wasn\u2019t involved with anything fun at that age tbh. Jealous and judgmental; bad combo for a \u201cfriend\u201d", "It\u2019s a different world in college post-covid. That might not be true lol. Those mfers are socially isolated now.", "That's very true - definitely telling of character and not in a good way", "I had to explain this to my family once, that I know several of the good \"sons and daughters\" who went to Ivies and now work cushy corporate gigs do coke and other drugs on the side.", "Or they\u2019re not currently but they\u2019ll probably end up having an early midlife crisis and probably end up living their early adulthood but when they\u2019re 40+.", "Right?? I was the good kid who did all the right things. The big difference is we didn\u2019t have IG back then!", "I'm starting to think we can just take the 'judge' out of that statement", "It's one thing to have sex in T A  and another to make TA a whole  personality", "Lmao good catch! OP is holier than thou!", "LOL I missed that one. Holy shit OP is just a complete asshole", "This is what got me! How creepy. He revealed his true colours.", "That just seems to be how my life goes \ud83d\ude02", "My dad is that kind of creepy older man that comments to us about our friends instagram posts. He said of my sister's best friend after she posted a topless pic with her nipples covered that if he knew this kind of content was on instagram he'd be on it more. It's so ick I still feel sick thinking about it now.", "Wonder what he would say if someone was doing it to his own daughter. Probably couldn\u2019t deal with the turntables.", "That\u2019s not true at all. Just following someone means that their stuff will come up in your feed now and then. How often and what will depend on \u201cthe algorithm\u201d. Also, isn\u2019t it a natural thing if you see something from someone you know to click in to their account and have a look at what\u2019s happened lately in their lives? I bet most of us do that all the time without even thinking about it.", "I mean, with my crazy friends from that age we lean into it with their kids. Like \u201clet\u2019s hope they don\u2019t X\u201d bringing up the memory from when their mom did that exact same thing and in hindsight it was dumb but oh so fun at the time. \n\nI grounded them when they went too far and they got me out of my comfort zone. It was a win win.  They didn\u2019t do the harder stuff often, but I always made sure they were safe when tripping or on x. \ud83d\ude02", "I failed out of school with one credit left and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s because I became depressed and STOPPED socializing. Couldn\u2019t get out of bed to go to class or the bar. I had a 4.0 the semester before, juuuuuuust about got a C in that last credit. Time moves on. I\u2019m still glad I made the friends that I did while partying it up.", "Oof. That\u2019s scary. I solo travel and have NEVER had sex on a trip.", "Oh please stop projecting. No one is talking about incels. It\u2019s not that deep", "yeah, it'd be different if he said something like \"well she's a free spirited party animal like you guys were\" or something along those lines. but how he put it........clearly the AH.", "LMAO", "Some Edward Turner and Sheldon Dinkleberg type commentary", "Lol! I mean, if your gonna say it, you should just come out and say it! No need to mince words!", "Even if they were saying they were worried about her, throwing their pasts in their faces would have been an asshole move. Something can be true (in your own opinion) and still be shitty to say.", "Lmao idk how that space got in there but you might be right", "He\u2019d definitely just say \u201cwell it\u2019s different because I\u2019m not creepy\u201d\n\nNews flash buddy", "Defending incels is bold", "Double whammy insult", "it was like.. slut shaming adjacent.  like he thinks it's his business how many boyfriends she's had???", "Well mentals don't necessarily do bigotry", "To us all. All good", "YTA lol wtf. Also why are you even looking at their daughters social media? Just bizarre all around dude, you should say you\u2019re sorry", "What an odd and inappropriate thing to say. Yta.", "YTA", "YTA Don\u2019t insert your opinion where it doesn\u2019t belong. Why are you so concerned about the behaviours of a young woman that isn\u2019t your own kid?", "YTA it's pretty much none of your business and it's not your place to judge. And you could have worded it much better too. Last week there was a post with an AH that used to say \"what's the harm if it's true?\" don't be that person OP. Get better.", "It's disgusting that a grown man is basically stalking a young girls' socials. It says a lot about you than their family.\n\nIf I were her parents I would be horrified too and protect her from creeps that stall her socials.\n\nYTA", "YTA lmao what a weird comment?", "YTA what\u2019s the issue? Why do you need to act like this is a problem? No one else thinks it\u2019s a problem so what\u2019s YOUR deal?", "Nta", "Nta \n\nI would have said the same. U got big cochones.\nMost people here don\u2019t", "NTA, some people just can't handle the truth about their children. Some kids are assholes. Some are weird as weird can be. I don't think you're the a-hole, but  you definitely butt hurt them because they probably realize in all honesty that you're right. And people tend to take stuff very hard when it comes to the kids. If you have been friends for years, maybe just keep the thoughts between you and your spouse, If you want to maintain the friendship, that is.", "No ,if you have been friends for so long,you could say anything that's true, imo", "If someone said, \"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree,\" about my kids, I would consider that shining, glowing praise.", "\"I guess\" indicates uncertainty. It's a common way to soften a statement.", "\u201cSorry I was objective, I know the truth can be painful.\u201d", "idk OP is right and apples tend to not fall far from the tree so chances are both him and his kid are judgemental af!", "*Everything* about this is creep-central!! Dude needs to take some time and sit with some big questions", "Well, the alternative is that his daughter is the one on Insta, but she mentioned Emily is having fun and OP made judgemental assumptions about what fun means for a young woman on Instagram. Either way, not great, but maybe he\u2019s not a creep. I hope.", "Why are you obsessed with this teenager?? Let\u2019s hope the parents keep Emily far away from you", "Except you are. You\u2019re also being judgmental towards your friends.", "You were calling her a slut. Seriously grow up and don\u2019t imply that about women. You are teaching your children poorly.", "If you don't care, why do you seem to be following her instagram so closely?", "An account made today to reply to comments in here with dickish and stupid comments? Are you OP or just a weirdo?", "I've been looking for this comment. This should be up higher.\n\nOP and his kids def don't have an honest relationship and they for sure would be afraid to come to him for *real* help with anything, esp something he'd look down on them for.\n\nSounds a lot like my mother.", "I judge a man that fucks around with anyone as much i judge a woman, its not a gender thing", "That's horrifying.  Do you still talk to him?", "indeed.", "I\u2019m low contact. I love him but his views on life are a bit messed up so I can only spend so much time with him before we start fighting and I end up leaving angry and upset."]}
