Your choice of words is one thing, but your tone is revealing. It sounds judgmental and jealous of the life experiences these people had and their daughter is having. Your children said she was fun, why are you looking at her Instagram posts if you disagree?!", "YTA for trying to slut shame a 19 year old. Full stop.

You\u2019re the biggest one for trying to slut shame a 19 year old directly to her parents and then being disingenuous about it when called out.

How is it an approving one? Why did you add \u201cI guess\u201d on the end?\n\nNow answer those same questions about your statement that she \u201cseems to have a lot of boy friends and parties\u201d.\n\nYour statements were judgmental, disapproving, and carried implications that you consider their daughter slutty and degenerate and them that way too, in retrospect. You were flexing on your own kid\u2019s current places in life by negatively judging them and their daughter sententiously.\n\nLearn some manners.\n\nYou\u2019re being deliberately obtuse when you said in reply to another comment that you didn\u2019t think saying Emily was similar to her parents was an inappropriate thing to do. But just in case you have cognitive limitations or social delays, if that\u2019s what you wanted to do here\u2019s how you do it right: \u201cI think it\u2019s great that Emily has the opportunity to spend some time traveling and having fun like you two did when you were younger.\u201d", "YTA - you were being judgmental. This wasn\u2019t a matter of your friends complaining about their kid or trying to figure out where they went wrong. They merely mentioned their kid and you decided to attack her character along with theirs!", "Pro tip: No one ever wants to hear someone else\u2019s opinion of their child\u2019s lifestyle, unless it is shining, glowing praise.", "On first glance it looks like you're not th'AH because you're just saying \"oh she's just like you were\", which is a fine comment to say - but your ENTIRE post is littered with judgement of your friends and her daughter, from calling them crazy as teenagers, \"fun\" in inverted commas, to snide off hands of \"my kids are at college and working\", the implication being \"my kids are well behaved and successful, unlike yours\". \n\nYou quite obviously look down upon them, and I have no idea why you're friends since you never seemed to approve of their \"lifestyle\". I can imagine your comment was said in the judgemental tone it was intended, which yes, would make YTA.", "Info: are you not aware that the phrase you used is usually used in a negative connotation? And it's amplified when using it towards things that people are often judged negatively for? So you came off as judgemental? Which I'm not even sure you weren't being from this post anyways. It seemed like such an unnecessary comment.", "Lol dude, the problem was not the apple comment, you know very well the second comment was waay too inappropriate. You could have simply said \"she's partying like you guys used to\" or \"she reminds me of you when you were younger living your best life\"", "Why would you use that particular saying even if that wasn\u2019t what you meant? It never has a positive connotation. Unless you meant it in a negative way, in which case you are 100% TA. If not you should probably clear that misunderstanding with them.", "YTA. Why are you even paying attention to a teenager's Instagram?", "YTA. You just come across as judgemental and disapproving. There was no need to mention to us that your children are in college and working, it's irrelevant, but you felt the need to tell us, to compare your children to Emily. No-one says 'the apple doesn't fall far from the tree' in a positive way - it's clearly judgemental of them and their daughter. Plus the way you put 'fun' in quotes.", "In this post and your comments you\u2019re pretty clearly trying to play this off as an innocent observation but it\u2019s not. Your addition of \u201cI guess\u201d at the end of your statement and judgmental tone is clear in the post and I\u2019m sure it was clear in the conversation as well. I\u2019m honestly kind of surprised you\u2019d been friends with them this long since you\u2019re so judgmental of them and now their daughter. It\u2019s none of your business what she\u2019s doing with her life and her parents didn\u2019t express concern or ask for your opinion. Her sex life is especially out of bounds and not your business to comment on or concern yourself with at any level.

You just called their daughter a wild child for no reason.", "YTA-  when you don't intend to be s judgmental dick, you apologize when folks point out you were a bit of a dick. If you double down and want credit for having good intentions when someone tells you your behavior wasn't appropriate- you are absolutely an asshole. \n\nAlso, why are you following a 19 year old girls Instagram- Stop following her.
