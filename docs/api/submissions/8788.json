Make sure you have everything moved out though before you tell him just tell him he\u2019s been making me feel uncomfortable and you don\u2019t wanna live here anymore. Make sure you set up another place before you do this though. And start putting your trash in different places and hiding your laundry maybe even get a lock on your door until you\u2019re able to find a spot.", "NTA - RUN MATE RUN NOW", "Get out before you find yourself drugged and chained to the bed. Also, there\u2019s probably a camera in your room. NTA", "Please move asap, you\u2019re not safe there.", "I immediately went to \"he's selling this stuff online\" reading through the first bit. The camera thing is c r e e p y. If you're not on the lease you could find someplace else and bounce one afternoon (I hope you can do this soon). It's suspect that he jumped to \"i'M nOt GaY!!1!!' when you asked about your kleenex.\n\nNTA!! Poor 20 year old (no sarcasm). You've been faced with a lot of real world all at once. i'm 33. i think i would have died if i had a roommate like that at 20, i certainly wouldn't have known what to do. i wouldn't know now honestly!", "NTA, but move out as soon as you have some place safe to sleep.

Dude sounds like a major creep.", "If you do it online they will send a notice with the new address - do it in person at the post office with your ID and there should be no notice", "Yeah how they ended up roommates would change the ick factor on the age gap. If the roommate just had an extra room, advertised it, and OP happened to be the first person who answered and passed the credit check that's one thing ... if this guy went from having no roommate at all to offering to rent his spare room to \\*this particular 20yo\\* who happened to need housing that's a whole lot creepier.", "NTA\n\nGet out now before he starts harvesting your organs.", "ESH but you should move regardless", "I think wondering if I'd BTAH would be the least of my concerns. I would just leave. Your name isn't on the lease... run, run away and don't look back. ...Unless you signed a contract with him, then I guess you'll have to do what you have to do to get out of it.", "NTA!!! Regardless of his sexuality, it\u2019s weird and creepy.", "NTA - sort of. You need to give him 30-days notice. No doubt your roomy has a 'thing' for you. The Kleenex thing is disgusting (by him, not you). The camera is a total invasion of your privacy. Legally, you could have left then. But, by staying, you consented. Consider couch-surfing if you cannot afford to move out and cover the 30-days you need to give him. I know it is a hard pill to swallow, but invasion of privacy is not a crime. I don't think stealing dirty Kleenex that has been thrown away is considered theft (just creepy).", "NTA. Leave immediately today. There is almost 100% a camera in your room. You may have to keep paying your usual but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay there. Talk to your landlord about the situation and see if you can break the lease. IMO you don\u2019t have to be considerate to creeps. Don\u2019t tell the roommate what your doing and don\u2019t give them a timeframe of when your leaving because he may just escalate knowing he won\u2019t be able to creep on you much longer.", "Piggybacking this comment. \n\nLook into how to use your phone's camera to detect IR light from cameras. Lots of ways to do a look through. After confirming there are no cameras look into getting one for your own. \n\nNTA", "I second this. OP, you are not safe there. It doesn't matter that you're a guy. This dude is a predator. He is doing wildly inappropriate things and angrily denying it when confronted. His behavior can and likely will escalate. Hell, it already has escalated by the sounds of it. You need to leave as quickly and quietly as possible. Check your room for a hidden camera before you do anything else. Then secure your bedroom door if you can't leave immediately. Watch your food and drink in case he puts something in it.\n\nThis man can hurt you. What would you be telling a female friend in this situation? Do it. Get the hell out.\n\nNTA. Please stay safe.", "If a hidden camera is found, don't  touch it, get the police involved", "Why are you still there? I feel like this is the start of criminal minds - gtfo man\n\nWhatever his deal, I wouldn\u2019t wanna be part of that.\n\nThe not gay comment is so random, he\u2019s clearly deflecting from something.\n\nJust tell him you\u2019ve paid Feb rent - he can keep it as the one month notice. You\u2019re not on the lease so GET OUT", "Nta. Something weird is going on. You should follow the advice of others here and do a thorough sweep of your room, if you find anything call the police, but make sure he cant get into your room or to you to destroy evidence. Maybe when hes not home?", "NTA - Probably hidden cameras in your bathroom and bedroom. If he is selling video, then used Kleenex, dirty clothes, etc. would sell at a premium.  Find his hidden cameras but leave them alone. Set up your own hidden camera. Get the police involved if can produce evidence of theft or surreptitious surveillance.", "NTA - please move out as soon as possible, do not stay there 1 minute longer then you have to. It\u2019s very concerning that he knew the exact moment to go into your bedroom to take the tissues out of you trashcan. Call your parents, but call them away from your apartment, let them know what\u2019s going on, tell them you would like to move quickly, set up a date & time to move when you know he won\u2019t be home. Make sure your parents &/or other older adults are there to help you move. Most importantly cut off all contact AND do not leave a forwarding address, it also may be wise to change your phone number too. If you have to call the police.", "He filmed you without your consent.

Or both. \n\nIn any case, RUN. \nNTA", "NTA - don\u2019t stay anywhere you are being made to feel threatened uncomfortable or violated . \nHe crossed a lot of boundaries.  GTFO ASAP\n\na couple of things \n-Leave money owed  to him in check form so you can prove you paid and So there is no reason he can validate finding you \n- have a friend or friends be with you when you are moving your things. \n-Contact the police sometimes when a person is moving out in domestic relationships etc they will have a cop escort outside the home . In any case alert police what you are doing \n- make your plans away from the house so he isnt forewarned on camera etc \n- is there a friend or family you can stay with? \n- somebody below made a good post about how to find cameras in your room etc \n\nI hope you are ok please keep us updated", "There's no reason for living anywhere you're uncomfortable.

Anyone else think there\u2019s a camera in his room?", "NTA- your roommate however is just a serious of red flags! \n\nWhatever his sexual preferences are, it\u2019s creepy AF! Also definitely gaslighting you to boot. I would get the hell out of there ASAP. I personally wouldn\u2019t even bother giving notice. Just pack up and get out, live on a friends sofa for a while if you have too. Check your room for cameras and maybe get a lock for your door. Maybe I\u2019ve been watching too much true crime but he\u2019s probably going to get worse.", "YTA.\n\nThis sounds like it's just some boyish fun.\n\nMaybe he has a crush on you, but at the end of the day he was just helping you tidy up. It's basically a free maid service.", "Dude NTA and RUN!!!", "YWNBTA. Get the hell out of there absolutely as soon as possible before things get worse. Whatever his intentions are, they're nothing good. That's actual sex predator behavior.", "OP has no lease/rental agreement.", "Good advise", "Yeah probably, but he was to bring it up", "Or forward to a PO Box. Then forward to the physical address from the box later.", "But then the creepy roommate could just sell his own dirty sock/underwear/Kleenex to perverts instead?
