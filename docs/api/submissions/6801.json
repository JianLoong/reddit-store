A lot has happened since then and it's not relevant to the post but long story short, I have no family left in my home country so I chose to acquire dual citizenship and stay where I now live.\n\nRecently I reconnected with my childhood friends and I was really happy to  reunite and catch up. They can't all come over to me because it's super expensive for three people to pay for a flight and accommodation.\nOne of them (Bea 26F) is married and she and her husband have a big home and usually invites the other two for weekends over/vacations. So she suggested they have me over this time for their early January vacation for two weeks. My job allows me to work from anywhere as long as I have my tablet and stylus so it wouldn't inconvenience me if I was away for two weeks. The others took time off work, I think. \n\nThe vacation was great for the most part and they were all kind to me despite all the years apart. Bea's husband was welcoming but that's where the conflict came in.\nWhenever I took some time to myself to work a little, he would be there, making small talk and joking around. Sometimes he would tell me things about himself and then say he doesn't feel like he has anyone to share these stuff with. \n\nI have no problem with being a confidant of some sort but I believe a husband shouldn't be spending too much alone time with his wife's friend no matter the reason.\nI told him this when it got too uncomfortable and explained my reasons. That's when he got really inappropriate and tried to shoot his shot. I freaked out and told him something along the lines of \"Bea is a great woman. I can't believe you would disrespect her like this.\"\nThings got awkward after that so I told my friends I'll find a hotel to stay at for the rest of my stay. They all burst out laughing saying things like 'gotcha' and asked if it's because Bea's husband came onto me. \n\nI asked how they knew because as long as he kept his distance, I wasn't planning to tell B and possibly cause an argument between them. \n\nIt turns out they were all in on it to \"prank\" me. \nI was furious. It didn't sound like a prank to me but one of those meaningless tests people do to test each other's loyalty. Things got heated and I left to find a hotel after giving them all a piece of my mind (including Bea's husband)\n\nI got here yesterday evening. One of the other friends called me saying vacation is ruined since Bea's husband is angry that I called him an a-hole in the argument and wants them to leave. She hopes I could apologize. Also, Bea does this to all her new friends to 'see how loyal they are' because her husband is handsome and a great guy and women want him. \n\nI responded with \"I wish I gave in to this great guy then\" and hung up. \nNow that I've calmed down, I think maybe I went a little too far with my response.

This is why suddenly reconnecting with random childhood friends is a bad idea. Many time we forget small things that happen which cause us to grow apart. Overtime it might look like naturally drifting apart but they always have reasons. You moved away and did not have a natural drifting apart so you got caught in their drama.

Seriously, do other women laugh when the \"prank\" is revealed? And just go on with their lives? I would be livid and go absolutely scorched earth. Jesus. I think they have something sick and twisted going on. This is not harmless or funny in any terms. Like does the wife enjoy being like, \"haha, he's my husband, you can't have him!\" Or \"Oh thank goodness you proved your loyalty! Now we can be friends!\" And other women are just like ... \"Yeah! Sure! Great!\" What if she has trauma? They don't freaking now. Guy is going to end up getting injured. Also, do they only do this to unattached ladies???", "NTA.

THEY ruined vacation \u2014 for you, by deliberately making you extremely uncomfortable, at which point you had lost your appetite for their brand of fun.

What gross \"friends\"", "NTA. Reddit is making me dumber apparently. Today\u2019s lesson: *sexual harassment is a prank*. JFC. It is not a prank, it is not something friends do to each other, and it is rife for bad feelings. And finally it seems like a setup. Like you have appeared open and they\u2019d dog pile on you, or you don\u2019t say *fuck no* as aggressively as you did and he goes way over the line *all for the prank*. Maybe he never drops the behavior-*still pranking you! Ha ha!* as he *sexually assaulting you*. Still the prank, soooo funny\u2026.\n\nFind better friends. Ugh.", "Since kindergarten to when? Everyone is a friend in kindergarten. Notice how most people drift apart and only some stay with you, it\u2019s because people keep changing through the years.
