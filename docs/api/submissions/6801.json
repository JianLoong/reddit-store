{"id": 6801, "submission_id": "106hahd", "title": "AITA for leaving and ruining the vacation over a 'harmless prank' ?", "selftext": "For anonymity, I'm using a throwaway and not mentioning country names.\nI (25F) moved out of the country I grew up in 7 years ago for college. A lot has happened since then and it's not relevant to the post but long story short, I have no family left in my home country so I chose to acquire dual citizenship and stay where I now live.\n\nRecently I reconnected with my childhood friends and I was really happy to  reunite and catch up. They can't all come over to me because it's super expensive for three people to pay for a flight and accommodation.\nOne of them (Bea 26F) is married and she and her husband have a big home and usually invites the other two for weekends over/vacations. So she suggested they have me over this time for their early January vacation for two weeks. My job allows me to work from anywhere as long as I have my tablet and stylus so it wouldn't inconvenience me if I was away for two weeks. The others took time off work, I think. \n\nThe vacation was great for the most part and they were all kind to me despite all the years apart. Bea's husband was welcoming but that's where the conflict came in.\nWhenever I took some time to myself to work a little, he would be there, making small talk and joking around. Sometimes he would tell me things about himself and then say he doesn't feel like he has anyone to share these stuff with. \n\nI have no problem with being a confidant of some sort but I believe a husband shouldn't be spending too much alone time with his wife's friend no matter the reason.\nI told him this when it got too uncomfortable and explained my reasons. That's when he got really inappropriate and tried to shoot his shot. I freaked out and told him something along the lines of \"Bea is a great woman. I can't believe you would disrespect her like this.\"\nThings got awkward after that so I told my friends I'll find a hotel to stay at for the rest of my stay. They all burst out laughing saying things like 'gotcha' and asked if it's because Bea's husband came onto me. \n\nI asked how they knew because as long as he kept his distance, I wasn't planning to tell B and possibly cause an argument between them. \n\nIt turns out they were all in on it to \"prank\" me. \nI was furious. It didn't sound like a prank to me but one of those meaningless tests people do to test each other's loyalty. Things got heated and I left to find a hotel after giving them all a piece of my mind (including Bea's husband)\n\nI got here yesterday evening. One of the other friends called me saying vacation is ruined since Bea's husband is angry that I called him an a-hole in the argument and wants them to leave. She hopes I could apologize. Also, Bea does this to all her new friends to 'see how loyal they are' because her husband is handsome and a great guy and women want him. \n\nI responded with \"I wish I gave in to this great guy then\" and hung up. \nNow that I've calmed down, I think maybe I went a little too far with my response.
