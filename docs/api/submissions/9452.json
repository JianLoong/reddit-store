The call of the wild narcissist???  Yeah... that's gaslighting pure and simple.", "NTA, but your mom is for being so emotionally immature.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go live with your grandparents, free yourself of this toxicity.", "NTA. Would living with your grandmother be a possibility? Would you be happier with that? It sounds like it might be a more stable environment.", "NTA", "NTA. It seems your mom doesn't like the honest truth of unintentional consequences from her behavior.\n\nSure, you could not have cheated, but you were scared. You wanted to pass. I'll be honest, I took pity on a few classmates a few times & let them cheat bc I could tell they were so stressed & clearly things were going on at home. We never got caught, thankfully, although I suspect some of my teachers realized it & just shook their head because they realized I was being WAY too nice. We all make mistakes growing up, and your mom should know better than to make you feel worse about your current situation. \n\nI have a family member that's like your mom. He was strict & some of his actions (like forcing everyone to eat everything, severe punishments, etc) had unintended consequences for his kids, as well as other family members he cared for. He still won't acknowledge that some of the unintentional issues that they had as teens & have as adults were in part because of him. I called him out on one of them, and it took some time, but he recognized it. The others though, still to this day, he won't lol. If he ever brings it up to me though, you bet I'm going to mention that it was partially his doing LOL but in a kind way. His kids did have to move out, so maybe you will have to as as well. \n\nIf studying will be better at your grandmother's, go there. Regardless of what happens - tell your mom you love her & she will always be your mom, and you are grateful for loving you & caring about you, but that she's a human being, and we are all imperfect & we ALL make mistakes, including her. Tell her  that you know being a parent is hard, but that parents also make mistakes, and it's part of being a human. That you know she tried the best that she could with what you all had. What's important is how you can both move forward together. \n\nI suspect it's a blow to her hearing that she wasn't a great mom, and is automatically going to the other extreme (I wasn't a terrible mom! how dare you!) but just because you made some mistakes (and hers are decently big, I'll say that) doesn't mean she was a terrible mom. Maybe not today, maybe not ever, but maybe it will hit her one day. \n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA.\n\nI was going to go with NAH but the last couple of paragraphs changed that. It sounds like your mother has had to try to make the best out of a hard situation with you and your siblings. Unfortunately, (it sounds like you\u2019re the oldest), you just seem to have been leant on to help whilst she\u2019s out working. Whilst that\u2019s not fair on you at all, if your mother was struggling financially you can see why this happened.\n\nThe issue is her attitude. Either she knows that it\u2019s her fault and simply can\u2019t accept it, or she genuinely believes what she is saying. Her reaction to me suggests that deep down she knows it\u2019s her fault. Some people fail miserably at accepting blame, or dealing with the guilt of that. They would rather try and put the blame elsewhere rather than accept their fault. \n\nYou\u2019re not the arsehole here and you\u2019ve been dealt a pretty shitty hand. However, it sounds like you\u2019re doing a good job of getting your head down and working hard. I would consider moving in with your grandmother so you can truly focus on your studying. It\u2019s not fair that you should have to compromise your future to look after the family. That is your mothers responsibility.", "20 year old from SA here (living in the US) and i CANNOT imagine being switched around so much especially not to an afrikaans school and vice versa. I\u2019m sorry tjommie, your mom is a narcissist, don\u2019t take her words to your heart.

She need to change before she can have sustain a healthy, familial relationship.\n\nMoving in with your grandmother, even if it would give a some peace and quiet, may be a blessing in disguise, it still is the most unfair situation for you and I truly hope this situation gets better soon!", "NTA,\n\n\\[Matric = 12th grade in SA.\\]\n\nYou\u2019ve definitely had an unfair time of it. My advice, however, would be tune out arguments and disagreements with your mother about your upbringing. You don\u2019t get anything out of that. Rather focus on what is good for you. Maybe move to your Gogo\u2019s if that will be a better environment for you. But don\u2019t allow this debris from the past to cloud your mind now. Focus on your studies and don\u2019t allow any defeatist thoughts into your mind about how you are doomed to fail. \n\nI have a friend from the old days who was nicknamed Teach. Never knew why until years later. Turned out he\u2019d spent his matric year in detention in the 80s and had done all his schoolwork by himself (so he was his own Teacher).
