Would living with your grandmother be a possibility? Would you be happier with that? It sounds like it might be a more stable environment.", "NTA", "NTA. It seems your mom doesn't like the honest truth of unintentional consequences from her behavior.\n\nSure, you could not have cheated, but you were scared. You wanted to pass. I'll be honest, I took pity on a few classmates a few times & let them cheat bc I could tell they were so stressed & clearly things were going on at home. We never got caught, thankfully, although I suspect some of my teachers realized it & just shook their head because they realized I was being WAY too nice. We all make mistakes growing up, and your mom should know better than to make you feel worse about your current situation. \n\nI have a family member that's like your mom. He was strict & some of his actions (like forcing everyone to eat everything, severe punishments, etc) had unintended consequences for his kids, as well as other family members he cared for. He still won't acknowledge that some of the unintentional issues that they had as teens & have as adults were in part because of him. I called him out on one of them, and it took some time, but he recognized it. The others though, still to this day, he won't lol. If he ever brings it up to me though, you bet I'm going to mention that it was partially his doing LOL but in a kind way. His kids did have to move out, so maybe you will have to as as well. \n\nIf studying will be better at your grandmother's, go there. Regardless of what happens - tell your mom you love her & she will always be your mom, and you are grateful for loving you & caring about you, but that she's a human being, and we are all imperfect & we ALL make mistakes, including her. Tell her  that you know being a parent is hard, but that parents also make mistakes, and it's part of being a human. That you know she tried the best that she could with what you all had. What's important is how you can both move forward together. \n\nI suspect it's a blow to her hearing that she wasn't a great mom, and is automatically going to the other extreme (I wasn't a terrible mom! how dare you!) but just because you made some mistakes (and hers are decently big, I'll say that) doesn't mean she was a terrible mom. Maybe not today, maybe not ever, but maybe it will hit her one day. \n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA.\n\nI was going to go with NAH but the last couple of paragraphs changed that.

Whilst that\u2019s not fair on you at all, if your mother was struggling financially you can see why this happened.\n\nThe issue is her attitude. Either she knows that it\u2019s her fault and simply can\u2019t accept it, or she genuinely believes what she is saying. Her reaction to me suggests that deep down she knows it\u2019s her fault. Some people fail miserably at accepting blame, or dealing with the guilt of that. They would rather try and put the blame elsewhere rather than accept their fault. \n\nYou\u2019re not the arsehole here and you\u2019ve been dealt a pretty shitty hand.

Maybe move to your Gogo\u2019s if that will be a better environment for you. But don\u2019t allow this debris from the past to cloud your mind now.

You got this!\n\n\nEdit: Saw your comments about your grandmother, and while I understand, I really think you should talk to her about what's going on. You definitely need some kind of responsible adult in your life who knows what's going on, and hell, maybe your grandmother would prefer having you to the alternatives.\n\nSecond edit: it's been a while since I was in school so I'm not sure how things work these days, but if there's a teacher you trust I would recommend talking to them about the situation as well just in case the situation takes a nose dive at home. I found just having that affords you a lot more leniency and second chances than just trying to do things by yourself", "NTA", "This AH actually believes she\u2019s a good mother? My cat would make a better mother than her. She sounds selfish, lazy and immature. The op should definitely take up the option to move to another relative if she thinks it will offer better stability.", "OP is a \"her.\"", "Dyslexia strikes again, I\u2019ll change that.", "No worries!", "NTA she sounds exhausting and ungrateful. Maybe you should go with your grandma OP. You wouldn\u2019t have to be a 2nd parent. Good luck on your exams.", "OP Did you grow up in circumstances where your mum had to pay for your education, but as a single mum didn't always earn enough to pay for 3 children? \nShe may have made what she thought were the \"least bad\" of limited options. \nIf your mum was doing her best in very difficult circumstances then that would have been very hurtful for her to hear. \nIf the cost of education was the real problem then maybe you need to place your anger elsewhere.\nYou probably owe each other an apology for being insensitive to how circumstances effected both of you.", "I think saying someone is narcissistic is thrown around too easily here. In this situation her mother is far more likely to have had a defensive (hurt) reaction to her daughter not understanding that she would have been trying her best. No-one would want to be called a bad parent when they've done everything they could for their kids but it still wasn't enough.", "NTA. Your mother is not acknowledging her failures and does not want to be held accountable. Sorry for what you went through and wishing you the very best for the future.", "NTA and your mom is stunted and acting like a child. Read adult children of emotionally immature parents.", "NTA\n\nChanging what language you\u2019re learning in, missing school for two years, being responsible for your siblings to a significant degree - those are significant hurdles to overcome.\n\nEven if your mom faced similar circumstances (which I doubt) her success despite the situation doesn\u2019t negate that it IS difficult - and as your mother, it was her choices that contributed to it.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have taken much for your mother to validate that you were struggling, she didn\u2019t need to bring up herself at all.\n\nAnd frankly your mother should be grateful for having a daughter who was doing HER job. \n\nI wish you the best of luck OP. Cheating wasn\u2019t a good choice but I can understand why you did it. You need support, not judgement.", "I fully agree with this. There\u2019s no point in arguing with your mom, OP, because she will always play the victim or act like she had it worse or that you\u2019re exaggerating or something. If she was apologizing or coming from a place of understanding I\u2019d say have those open and honest conversations with her. But as it stands now, trying to argue will just be a never ending frustration and there are much better areas to focus your time and attention.", "Narcissists always claim they were perfect parents, and that the children were ungrateful and don't remember how wonderful everything was.", "NTA.  I'm sorry you went through such chaos where your education is concerned.  This is not your fault, and you hit the nail right on the head--your education was chaotic and interrupted, totally your mother's responsibility.", "Cats make great moms \n\nmy cat was at deaths door and used the last of her strengths to groom my hair:( to make sure I\u2019d be ok In the big cruel world \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude22", "Same here. Sounds like we had the same mother", "I can vouch for that.  \"So I guess I'm a rotten mother!\"", "This line is why my mother gets 2 hours maximum from me on important holidays, and not much else. And that's mostly to avoid any latent possibility of my own regret when she passes.", "NTA. You are amazing. I hope you realize that. I read your initial post and subsequent comments and am so proud of how you have handled adversity because it does not sound easy. Wishing you the best.", "Absolutely spot on! And these terrible parents love to remind you of all the things they did for you; they never reflect on the things they did TO you.", "Oh man, this one got me. What a good kitty :( I'm not crying!!", "Fucking onions, man.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m a teacher. This is \ud83d\udcaf not your fault! \u2665\ufe0f", "Nta. You SHOULD maybe go back and live with your grandmother. Your mom sounds like a narcissist.", "Not knowing more, this sounds like the struggles of many parents in developing nations. She did not have the money to give you a good, stable education. Life was tough; she did the best she could. As the oldest, you were the only one available to parent your siblings. When you blamed Mom for your struggles in school, she went into defensive mode. Her reaction is not the best, but I think she's feeling guilty and hurting. You are hurting, too.\n\nI think you're asking AITA because you know this, and you don't really want to go live with grandmother. NAH.", "NTA.\n\nReading something like this makes me grateful to live in a developed nation.", "Nta but I agree you should move out to your grandparents if that is a viable option. Your situation is abusive, you dealt with parentification at a young age.", "NTA. Your mother is a narcissist. She will never prioritize you. She will never admit she was wrong. In her eyes, it will always be someone else's fault. Because that's what narcissists do. The only way for you to be a priority is to leave. My mother is a narcissist. I know this pain well. I also went to multiple different schools growing up (luckily no language shifts though) it's hard. It will remain hard. But you can overcome it. You can make it. Keep forging ahead as best you can. Good Luck.", "Your mother made some really shit decisions that badly affected your life. That is undeniable.\n\nYou have also made some really shit decisions. Yes, you were a child, but you are 18 now. You need to accept that those choices (like chucking sickies regularly) were actually YOUR choice. You can't change them, but by truly accepting your mistakes, you can move on, and do better.\n\nMove in with your grandmother. Hopefully without all the extra chores, you will have time to both study and do homework. Get help from teachers, and really put the hours in. NTA", "No! Now I'm having flashbacks! How many f*cking times have I heard that. My mom also did a *tisk* sigh combo to let you know whatever you just said/asked for was completely unreasonable and a burden. Even when it was a necessity. I might need therapy."]}
