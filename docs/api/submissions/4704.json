{"id": 4704, "submission_id": "zltq76", "title": "AITA for getting my girlfriend a Cricut instead of a sewing machine?", "selftext": "Hi, I'm M26 and my girlfriend, Sarah is F27.Yesterday was Sarah's birthday. A couple weeks ago, she requested a sewing machine for her birthday gift. Even though she already had one (that was not broken), I agreed to get it for her. Since I'm a guy who knows nothing about sewing, I spent a a good 2 weeks of searching for a good model. In the end, I picked a Brother sewing machine along with some extra materials.\n\nJust when I was about to order it, I came across the Cricut Maker 3. For those who don't know, Cricut is something that can cut all kinds of things (e.g. fabric, wood, paper, leather). It can even engrave metal! It is used to make DIY projects like stickers, bags, mugs and necklaces.\n\nSince Sarah is very into crafting, I immediately thought she'd love it. In my opinion, it was way better than the sewing machine (since she already had one). Sure, the Cricut was double the price of the sewing machine (nearly $1000) but I had some money saved.\n\nAfter some research, I bought the Cricut with a Heat Press and other tools. I thought it would be an amazing birthday gift. I was about to tell Sarah that I didn't get the sewing machine - but knowing her, she would beg me to tell her what her new gift was. I wanted it a surprise so I decided to keep it a secret.\n\nFast forward to her birthday. Sarah was super excited.\n\nI gave her the present, saying that I didn't get the sewing machine but I got something even cooler. As I said those words, I could sense her disappointment but she was trying to hide it. I suddenly felt really bad but I hoped that she would like the Cricut.\n\nWhen she unwrapped the present, she looked even more disappointed. She said \"Thanks... I don't see why you couldn't get a sewing machine though. It isn't hard to get one.\" I was kinda put off by her 'unappreciation', but I apologised anyway.\n\nSarah continued - \"When you tell me what you want for your birthday, I get it for you. I didn't get you books when you said you wanted a kettle.\"\n\nI tried to explain what a Cricut could do, but she didn't really listen. She just pulled out her phone and Googled the price. When she found out I spent $1000+ on the present, she freaked out. She said that I could've gotten her *four* sewing machines for that price, or that I could've simply taken her on holiday.\n\nThis hurt me, because I did put in a lot of effort in my gift. It's embarrassing, but I suddenly was on the verge of tears. I don't cry much, but I felt emotional at that moment. When Sarah saw that, she said - \"Why are you crying? I do appreciate your present but it's just you totally disregarded what I wanted.\"\n\nShe left to give me some space, but we still had birthday dinner together. It was rather awkward but we pulled through.\n\nFast forward to today. Sarah still hasn't touched her Cricut. It's almost like she's trying to make a point that I really wasted my money on something she wouldn't use.\n\nI do feel a bit like an asshole because I did ignore what she wanted. But at the same time I feel I had good intentions...?\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: Hi again. After reading all your comments, I realise that I was indeed an asshole. But believe me when I say that 1) I wasn't trying to guilt-trip her by crying and 2) I didn't get the Cricut so she could make me things.\n\nHowever, I'll admit that I thought that the Cricut was cooler and bought it partly because of that. I was wrong because ultimately it's her gift not mine.\n\nThanks for all the responses. Since I already knew what model and materials to get, I just placed an order for the Brother sewing machine. It can only be delivered in a week's time, so I'm going to get some of her favourite food today to make up for it. I haven't returned the Cricut because all those add-ons would be tricky to return. I'm still deciding if I should keep it or not.\n\nLastly, if you're wondering why I bought the Cricut: This was 2 years ago, but Sarah saw a machine similar to a Cricut in an art store and said that when she had more money, she would get it. Also, throughout the years, she has been interested in cutting wood and fabrics. But yes, I should've asked her first before splurging on this gift.\n\nThanks again.\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of people wondering how I spent $1000 on the Cricut haha - I'm not in the US!", "created_utc": 1671031253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zltq76/aita_for_getting_my_girlfriend_a_cricut_instead/", "score": 2585, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It takes a lot of time and energy to craft things with it, especially if you're a beginner.  Why would you buy something you knew nothing about or that she never asked for when you knew what she wanted? YTA", "YTA. She told you what she wanted, but you decided that you knew better. You decided that your take on it was far superior to hers, and that you knew better what she would enjoy than she did. Then, when she pointed out that she told you what she wanted, you got all hurt about it, and became the victim. Gross. \n\n\nYou have a deep lesson to learn here. I hope you take the time to learn it.", "> Fast forward to today. Sarah still hasn't touched her Cricut. It's almost like she's trying to make a point that I really wasted my money on something she wouldn't use.\n\nNo, she probably hasn't touched it because she didn't want it. You misjudged her interests and bought something she has no interest in, and did it on a gift well above the price point where you should check with somebody before buying it for them. Especially when it comes to crafting, something somebody doesn't really want rapidly becomes a chore instead of fun.\n\nYTA, a little bit, not because you tried to surprise your GF with a nice gift, but because you're showing a clear pattern of not actually thinking about what she wants and mistrusting her intentions. Return the Cricut and get her a sewing machine like she asked.", "YTA, she hasn't touched her Cricut you say? If I didn't know any better I'd say she doesn't want it nor have a use for it...", "I'm going to assume that your GF wants a sewing machine because she sews - as in she puts cloth together and uses the machine to attach them together.\n\nThe Cricut does the opposite - subtractive manufacturing.\n\nSomeone telling me what to get them would be the best thing ever. I suck at picking gifts. If my SO told me exactly what they wanted, that saves me from a potentially bad pick.\n\nYTA, but gently.", "YTA - you bought her something she had no interest in because *you thought it was cool and therefore she should use it.*\n\nBy the way, it's totally reasonable to own more than one sewing machine, especially when they have different features and can handle different types of projects. And to have them set up simultaneously to work on more than one thing at a time.\n\nYou're upset because YOU decided what she *should want*, and she hasn't touched it to. You do understand that her not being interested in the thing she doesn't want isn't an attack, right? Her having her own mind, and her own wants, and not yielding to what you attempt to impose on her isn't being passive aggressive. You bought her something she didn't want, and decided for her what she needs. That's asshole territory. She isn't a 3 year old.", "Gently, YTA. \n\nShe asked for something specific and a Cricut is much different than that of a sewing machine.\n\nIt does sound like you had good intentions, but if Sarah wanted a Cricut, she likely would've asked for one. \n\nMy advice would be to return it and shop for a sewing machine she actually wants together.", "YTA. She told you what she wanted. You ignored her and thought you knew better because she already had a sewing machine. There is a VAST difference in sewing machines - she likely has a basic one that can't handle heavy fabrics or do more complicated stitching. Bottom line, you IGNORED what she told you. Return the Cricut and get the sewing machine.", "Oh dear. Yta even though you didn't mean to be. First, being crafty doesn't mean the cricut is for you. I got one at a yard sale and it's amazing, but I rarely use it. It's only for specialized crafts. Second, being thoughtful can mean different things at different times and with different people. You thought about what she might want and tried to pick something she might like. That's a generous impulse. But in doing so you ignored what she actually said. Out loud. With words. That's a patronizing and AHish impulse. You think you know better than she does what she wants even when she's clear about what she wants. Don't do that.\n\nApologize. Take back the cricut, buy the sewing machine. In the meantime try to remember that this argument wasn't about the gift. It was about the lack of respect you unintentionally demonstrated.", "YTA. Both for buying her what she didn\u2019t want, AND for making it about the money. You\u2019re not gonna buy her love with money, you\u2019re going to earn it\u2014partly through respecting her opinions.", "YTA and presumably the issue is resolved by returning the Cricut and getting a sewing machine. \n\nA sewing machine is a very basic need for someone who wants a sewing machine. My mother had a sewing machine which she used quite a bit and would have had no need or interest in a Cricut because she had no interest in crafting but actually sewing - i.e. making her own clothing; altering my clothing. She did quilting but mostly handwork for her quilting.\n\nWhile there are inexpensive sewing machines that work, the more expensive machines can do amazing stuff. At this point, return the Cricut and take your girlfriend along to actually pick out the machine she wants based on the amount you want to spend. If she loves to sew and actually uses the machine, it is the kind of thing in which it sometimes pays to spend for features that make advanced sewing techniques possible.", "YTA.\nA generous one, but still... it feels kind of horrible for someone to ask you what kind of gift you want,  agree to it and then turn around get something you have never shown any interest in.  You chose something *you thought was cool* after promising to get what she wanted. \n\nYou asked her wishes and then ignored them. \n\nIn your shoes,  I would have asked some questions about what was wrong with the sewing machine she has- does it not have enough power? Does she want more stitching options? Is the motor approaching the end of its lifespan? Does she just want a second machine so she can more easily switch between heavy fabrics and more delicate material?", "She told you exactly what she wanted, a sewing machine, meaning her crafts are strictly fabric crafts. You disregard what she clearly asked for, got her something that doesn't align with the crafts she does, and expect her to be happy over it?\n\n\nThe only one you should be disappointed in is yourself. She even said that she gets you exactly what you ask for, so why couldn't you do the same for her?\n\n\nYTA", "YTA-Good intentions would be getting her what she asked for not deciding you know better than her about what she wants and getting that instead. It is the thought that counts but this kind of gift is thoughtless.", "\"Sarah still hasn't touched her Cricut. It's almost like she's trying to make a point that I really wasted my money on something she wouldn't use.\"\n\nShe didn't touch it because that's not what she needs for her project(s).  Stop projecting/assuming.\n\n\"I do feel a bit like an asshole because I did ignore what she wanted\"\n\nClearly sewing is an important hobby of hers and, whether her old sewing machine works or not, she's tired of it for whatever reason. I'm sure she's given you a reason why that you either forgot or aren't sharing.\n\nYeah, you researched a bunch.  Good for you, but that's not what she asked you to do.

You completely ignored your girlfriend skill set (sewing) and completely dismissed her ability to assess how good her own tools are (saying that a new sewing machine wasn't needed because she had one). \n\nEveryone who's saying N T A seems to miss how you completely don't have any respect for your girlfriend's skills or her ability to convey her needs.\n\nIt's incredibly rude of you to assume that you know better than her after a quick Google search what tools she needs and what is a better crafting machine. She literally told you. \n\nAnd now you have the audacity to be mad that she's not using a machine that she doesn't have an interest in nor knows how to use? You're again making her gift about you. Nothing you have done is selfless.\n\nYTA and maybe stick to giving gift cards if you're going to openly insult people with gifts like this.", "YTA - Instead of getting her something she wanted, you got her something you thought was cool. And not only that, you got her all excited to get the thing she actually wanted, only to let her down in the moment by giving her something she probably doesn\u2019t even know how to use. \n\nCricut is a totally different skill set than sewing. Just because someone is \u201ccrafty\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t take substantial time and effort to learn each crafting skill. I crochet and if someone got me a $1,000 set of knitting needles, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with them. It would take me a substantial amount of time and effort to learn. Because it\u2019s a skill set I don\u2019t already have.\n\nAnd now, when she\u2019s not spending the time to learn how to use a totally new thing that she didn\u2019t want or need just to make you feel better, you\u2019re in your head thinking she\u2019s not using it just to make a point to you.\n\nDo you not see how you\u2019re making this whole thing all about you?", "YTA Your intentions don't matter. You are an asshole for deciding you thought this would be a better gift. It is NOT the same thing, and it is NOT what she wanted/needed. You seem to be on some high horse because you spent more money, but she's right.", "YTA - Rule of thumb:  If you want to make someone happy on their birthday or Christmas, get them what they ask for\u2026", "YTA\n\nYou knowingly got her something she doesn't want or need. Just because she sews, it doesn't mean she is into any kind of craft. \n\nConsidering you still didn't exchange it and didn't get her what she wanted, and somehow see her as the guilty party for not enjoying it... Sucks.\n\nPS: what you did was perfectly intentional. You knew what she wanted. You got something random for her on purpose.", "YTA. Do you think you discovered Cricut? I don't craft, and I know what one is. They have been around for quite a while.\n\nYou realize you completely man-splained what a Cricut is and why she needs one more than a sewing machine, right?\n\nHere is the problem: \nI get that you may not know about a Cricut and thought it was a cool gadget, but why did you assume that she didn't know what one was or that she needed/wanted something she never mentioned before?  Why do you think she doesn't need a new sewing machine when you don't sew and specifically told you that is what she needs & wants? You aren't an expert on sewing or crafting, but you know better than her? She is pissed off b/c she listens to what you need/want and respects it. You don't reaspect what she needs/wants and think you know better. I'm guessing this isn't the first time you have done this nor is this kind of arrogance and dismissive behavior limited to gift giving.", "This is a classic example of the gift giver making it about them and not about what the recipient actually wants. This would be like if you asked for golf clubs and she got you a new bike. A cricut and a sewing machine are two completely different things. \n\nSoft YTA because this wasn\u2019t malicious but if you ask someone what they want for a gift, listen to them and don\u2019t get them something you think they \u2018should\u2019 want.", "YTA - The cricut, CAN do a lot... but it can't do what a sewing machine can do at all.

Instead you decided to surprise her because you thought you knew better and are still hanging on to the belief that the cricut is better than a sewing machine. But it can't sew!

You obviously had good intentions, but when someone tells you what they want and you agree to get it for them, that is the gift you should get them. She was obviously really excited about the new sewing machine and her response was just the disappointment in realizing that you got her something she didn't ask for. Can you return the cricket and get the original sewing machine?", "YTA\nYour competent girlfriend who knows what she needs and wants in order to do what she wants to do told you what to get and you decided that her hobby wasn't good enough and instead she needs this other hobby that you deem cooler.\nFYI: I don't know any serious seamstress with just one machine.", "YTA.\n\nI was going to go E S H because there were far nicer ways for her to express her disappointment but one line gives me pause: \n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it was way better than a sewing machine.\u201d\n\nGifts aren\u2019t about what\u2019s better. They are about what holds the most meaning for the receiver. A simpler, more inexpensive tool can hold more meaning and usefulness for someone then a flashy expensive item they will never use.\n\nIt also sounds like you yourself are not a sewer. Sewing is a far different skill than decorating mugs.\n\nA sewer may work with leather and metal sparingly but they require separate skills.

You agreed to buy her a sewing machine. Then, you instead bought a completely different machine with a big learning curve and all these attachments for it that have nothing to do with sewing.

She wants to sew, which is why she asked for a new sewing machine. She does not want to do heat transfers. \n\n(Also, all of y\u2019all in the comments saying we don\u2019t get to pick our gifts: have you never put together an Amazon wish list or wedding / baby registry?

I can be 100% clear on something I want and he\u2019ll go pick out something that\u2019s kind of like what I wanted but totally opposite. He gets distracted by something he thinks I might like versus just getting the thing I 100% want. \n\nSo I don\u2019t love getting presents anymore. And then, he\u2019s hurt because I\u2019m not excited. \n\nSelfish? Maybe. But I try to get him what he wants or even let him order it himself so he gets EXACTLY what he wants.

But gifts are not supposed to be obligations. They are GIFTS. He obviously genuinely thought he was getting her something even cooler than the sewing machine. It was fine for her to be disappointed, but the proper reaction to getting a gift is always to be thankful and appreciative, and it is certainly not to google the price and complain that she would rather have been taken on a vacation with that (very generous) amount of money.\n\nThe proper reaction on her part would have to be appreciative in the moment. Then to consider whether the machine would actually be something she could use. Then, if she decided the answer was no, to go to bf a couple days later and very politely explain that while she really appreciates the thought, she is fairly sure she won't really have use for the machine, and see if perhaps it could be returned and she could put the money towards a sewing machine instead.", "NTA. I understand her disappointment, it wasn't what she asked for but you didn't choose a different option to be malicious! Gift-giving is all about the thought. One time for my birthday my partner got me a locket with a cardinal bird on it. Honestly, it's big and clunky and not my taste. But he got it for me because cardinal birds remind me of my late grandmother who I was really close with and he wanted to surprise me with something meaningful. I don't wear it often, but I do have it displayed nicely on my dresser so I can see it every day because the thought behind that gift was incredibly sweet and meaningful. You tried to do something nice and she's allowed to be disappointed she didn't get the sewing machine, but this reaction? Out of proportion and honestly just kind of bratty.

A couple weeks ago, she requested a sewing machine for her birthday gift. Even though she already had one (that was not broken), I agreed to get it for her. Since I'm a guy who knows nothing about sewing, I spent a a good 2 weeks of searching for a good model. In the end, I picked a Brother sewing machine along with some extra materials.\n\nJust when I was about to order it, I came across the Cricut Maker 3. For those who don't know, Cricut is something that can cut all kinds of things (e.g. fabric, wood, paper, leather). It can even engrave metal! It is used to make DIY projects like stickers, bags, mugs and necklaces.\n\nSince Sarah is very into crafting, I immediately thought she'd love it. In my opinion, it was way better than the sewing machine (since she already had one). Sure, the Cricut was double the price of the sewing machine (nearly $1000) but I had some money saved. \n\nAfter some research, I bought the Cricut with a Heat Press and other tools. I thought it would be an amazing birthday gift. I was about to tell Sarah that I didn't get the sewing machine - but knowing her, she would beg me to tell her what her new gift was. I wanted it a surprise so I decided to keep it a secret.\n\nFast forward to her birthday. Sarah was super excited. \n\nI gave her the present, saying that I didn't get the sewing machine but I got something even cooler. As I said those words, I could sense her disappointment but she was trying to hide it. I suddenly felt really bad but I hoped that she would like the Cricut.\n\nWhen she unwrapped the present, she looked even more disappointed. She said \"Thanks... I don't see why you couldn't get a sewing machine though. It isn't hard to get one.\" I was kinda put off by her 'unappreciation', but I apologised anyway. \n\nSarah continued - \"When you tell me what you want for your birthday, I get it for you. I didn't get you books when you said you wanted a kettle.\"\n\nI tried to explain what a Cricut could do, but she didn't really listen. She just pulled out her phone and Googled the price. When she found out I spent $1000+ on the present, she freaked out. She said that I could've gotten her *four* sewing machines for that price, or that I could've simply taken her on holiday. \n\nThis hurt me, because I did put in a lot of effort in my gift. It's embarrassing, but I suddenly was on the verge of tears. I don't cry much, but I felt emotional at that moment. When Sarah saw that, she said - \"Why are you crying? I do appreciate your present but it's just you totally disregarded what I wanted.\"\n\nShe left to give me some space, but we still had birthday dinner together. It was rather awkward but we pulled through.\n\nFast forward to today. Sarah still hasn't touched her Cricut. It's almost like she's trying to make a point that I really wasted my money on something she wouldn't use. \n\nI do feel a bit like an asshole because I did ignore what she wanted. But at the same time I feel I had good intentions...? \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Per your post, I can see you put effort into finding a sewing machine, but that wasn\u2019t the gift you gave.", "Yta - I\u2019m a crafter too. Don\u2019t get me wrong the present you got her is a great but she wanted a new sewing machine.", "I am a fairly heavy Circuit user, and YTA.\n\nTo put it into perspective, you got her a CNC mill when she asked for a drill press. Sure, it might do similar, but it is absolutely not the same.", "YTA. She wanted a sewing machine and you got her something else she didn\u2019t want bc you know better and get then offended when she doesn\u2019t use it?!! \n \nIt\u2019s like getting someone roller blades when they wanted skates bc they can\u2019t roller blade bc it hurts the feet and then getting mad bc they won\u2019t willingly hurt their feet to use the gift they didn\u2019t want", "YTA. She told you what she really wanted. You ignored her. Return that thing and take her sewing machine shopping so she can choose for herself. This isn\u2019t rocket science.", "YTA,\n\nShe hasn't touched it because she is not interested.  You should be gotten the sew machine like she wanted and get over sewing accessories to go along with it.\n\nNext time when she asks for example a specify book, don't buy her a dictionary.  Because a dictionary is better because it has all the words.", "YTA. \n\nListen, people should be gracious when they get gifts they don't want, but also if you have an agreement where you will get people what they ask for, you are an AH for going against it. \n\nYour girlfriend asked for a sewing machine and you AGREED (literally what you say) to get her one. That means she expected one and didn't ask anyone else for that gift. You could have said no, or even \"we will see\" but you agreed that is what you were getting her and she got excited to have a new one.  It doesn't matter if she already has one that you deem works fine. Maybe it doesn't work that well and you wouldn't know that because you don't sew on it,  maybe it doesn't do the things she wants, maybe overall she wants a new model. I have a car that works fine and at some point I'm getting a new one, even if this one runs. \n\nYou are the one who got excited to get her something that you think is cool, with zero regards to her own interests or what you agreed to. And it is even more frustrating that it costs more because she didn't want it at all. She wanted to sew, not like...work with metal. \n\nAnd now you are bothered she isn't using it, when she never asked for it and also told you to your face she didn't like it. The shock!", "YTA. People who tell you they want sewing machines really want sewing machines.", "YTA. Idk why you felt that you knew what she wanted more than she does.", "You meant well, but ultimately she is right. She told you what she wanted, and I question her a bit about this, because as you noticed, sewing machines are not such a simple thing, so maybe a bit more guidance would have been good.\n\nBut you decided to go a totally different way, which sounds like you put a lot of thought into it. But yeah seems like you misjudged a bit.\n\nI will call NAH, because you meant well, and she expected different. Things happen", "NAH - why not just return the thing and all it\u2019s items and get get the sewing machine? You took a swing trying to get something \u2018better\u2019 and it was a miss. \n\nApologize, tell her you\u2019re returning it, and ask her if there\u2019s anything specific she wants in the new sewing machine. Take an interest in her interests", "YTA. All crafts are not interchangeable. \n\nIf your GF doesn't do any crafts that she would use a Cricut for, then the gift was not useful for her. She told you what she wanted and would use: a sewing machine.\n\nI own both a sewing machine and a cutting machine similar to a Cricut. That's because I make different crafts with each. I got my cutting machine after years of cutting shapes by hand (either scissors, xacto knives, or manual die cuts). I only made the investment after I determined it was worth the money and time to use it (it's a tad temperamental). However, it still spends lots of time in my closet because even I only need it a few times a year.\n\nYour GF hasn't used the gift because she doesn't do those kinds of craft projects. She does sew, which is why she wanted a nice sewing machine. You didn't listen, but now are upset that she isn't using a craft machine that she never wanted.\n\nWould *I* love to be gifted hundreds of dollars of Cricut products? Absolutely, because it would be a big step up for stuff I already use. But again, it's because that's in my craft wheelhouse. It's not in your GF's. She likes to sew, so that's what she would appreciate.", "YTA\n\n>A couple weeks ago, she requested a sewing machine for her birthday gift.\n\n>I feel I had good intentions...? \n\nGood intentions would be getting her the sewing machine she requested. It doesn't matter that she already has a sewing machine or that Cricuts can do a million different things. It's not what she wanted. \n\nIf possible just return the stuff you bought. Ask Sarah which specific sewing machine she wants and get it. Just listen to her next time.", "YTA. She didn't ask for a Cricut. She doesn't do the sorts of crafts that are made with a Cricut.

You got her something she doesn't use or probably even know HOW to use. You didn't get her what she wanted and instead got her something YOU wanted (or at least thought was cooler).

Looks like you bought something that you thought was cool.", "YTA She specifically asked for one thing and you got another, something she most likely won\u2019t even use.

It\u2019s not like she wasn\u2019t clear about it.", "YTA\nCricut is so different from sewing machine. No wonder she's not using it. I like embroidery and if you gave me this instead of embroidery hoop I wouldn't know what to do with it. There are so many different types of crafting and each of them need different tools and materials. You should've given her what she wanted, not what you wanted her to have.", "Oh pal, I actually feel so bad for you, I think you've upset yourself but thought you were doing something that she would love. So for that reason YTA, but clearly not malicious, just misguided. \n\nI think in the future a surprise present would be better as a small side along present. So for example, main present sewing machine which was asked for, and a surprise present is some flowers. \n\nEither return or sell the cricut, buy her a sewing machine and if there's much difference maybe go spend a weekend together to properly bury the hatchet.", "I'm confused. Sewing machines attach fabric to fabric, and can range from super simple to super complex. They are for making clothes or quilts, or even embroidery.  Cricut is sort of an ultra fancy paper cutter plus ironing board. How did you jump from one to the other in your head? They're not remotely the same type of crafting. It's like asking for a bicycle and being given an expensive hang glider instead.\n\nI'm voting YTA because you decided that you know her mind and crafting preferences better than she does. That's never going to go over well. I'd suggest you return the Cricut and take her shopping for her dream sewing machine with all the bells and whistles.", "YTA. Just another somebody that thinks they know better what someone else likes and wants. Very disappointing.", "NTA a birthday WISH list is just that a wish list. It\u2019s not for people to demand what others GIFT them. Do you have a habit of disregarding her wants? Based on what you wrote it doesn\u2019t seem like it. She already has a working item of what she wanted, you were going to get her that item but, found something you thought she would like and would be a surprise. She also didn\u2019t specify the sewing machine she wanted so how were you to know that she wanted that no ifs and it buts about it.\n\nI think her attitude was wrong and ungrateful. As a crafting person she would likely love it but chose to throw a pity party and make you feel bad instead. If she really wouldn\u2019t use it than she could have been much kinder and diplomatic in her delivery of that message. \n\nWith her attitude though return the stuff, get her a sewing machine and think hard about the relationship. If this is a one off or a pattern of hers.", "NAH. It was a very generous gift and I'm sure your heart was in the right place, but at the same time, she told you clearly what she wanted and that wasn't it. Can the Cricut be returned? If it's still in the box and you have the receipt, the store should take it back. Then you can get her the sewing machine she really wants.", "YTA. Return it fool. Get her the sewing machine and plan a weekend getaway with the extra money leftover.", "What Cricut costs $1k? I thought $300 tops.", "YTA and here's why:\n\n>I tried to explain what a Cricut could do, \n\nYou admit you know nothing about sewing, yet took it upon yourself to disregard her request and buy her a completely different type of machine because YOU thought it was better. Then you tried to mansplain to her why she should be grateful for your *superior* decision. Get over yourself.", "YTA- a circuit and sewing machine cannot even do the same thing. She is *not* making a point by not using, she doesnt craft that way!", "My suggestion: sit her down. Tell her you love how creative and crafty she is. You came across the circuit and, when reading about what it does, it made you think of her because it can do so many neat things and you imagined all the unique and interesting things she could create with it. Now you understand it is not something she is really interested in and you will happily return it and she can pick out the sewing machine she wants.\n\nI get it - it\u2019s kind of disappointing when you choose a gift for someone special by putting a lot of thought into who they are and that connection is not recognized. She is thinking you were not listening to her when you were actually thinking about her interests and personality when you bought the gift. Hopefully you guys can use the opportunity to bolster communication skills.", "Soft YTA. I'm not a fan of telling people what to get me, and I think this was a very thoughtful gift. However, you told her you were getting her a sewing machine, so I understand her disappointment.", "Gentle YTA. If you ask someone what they want, they tell you, it's really disappointing when they don't get what they wanted. If you aren't going to listen, don't bother asking. My family used to do this to me all the time. Birthdays and Christmas, they'd ask what I wanted. I'd tell them specifically. They either didn't bother, or get me a generic version of what I wanted or something vaguely similar. It really is a let down.  \nFor example, I'm a crocheter. I got given a knitting kit because it's the same, right? Wrong. Totally different skill.", "YTA. She wanted something specific and you got her something totally different.", "The road to misery is paved with good intentions. Sorry, YTA.", "YTA. Your ego is getting in the way. First you didn't listen to or understand your girlfriend well enough to get WHY she wanted a new sewing machine even though she already has one. How old is her current one? Does it work well? What kind of features does it have? What kinds of projects does she want to do with it? Does she already have projects in progress that she has materials and plans for that the new machine was supposed to help her accomplish? \n\nYou don't seem to understand why the answers to any of those questions might be important. You just assumed that her request was stupid because you hadn't taken the time to ask her why she wanted it. Instead you found a different machine that was better according to YOUR criteria; but you don't even know why she wanted a sewing machine, so your criteria are completely irrelevant. Then, when you had a chance to check with her about it first and make sure she wanted it, you decided not to, because it was more important to you that you pulled off a surprise than that she actually get a gift she enjoys. \n\nYour priorities are out of whack. Gifts are supposed to show the recipient that you are thinking about what's important to them and what they like. The point of giving a gift is not to spend a lot of money or make yourself look cool for picking something out. You're making this all about YOU instead of her.", "Even though your intentions were good, YTA. A Cricut is a cool thing and there's a bunch of things you can do with it, none of them are sewing, which is your GF's hobby.

She's also TA a little because of her displaying her disappointment and not acknowledging that to a layman, this seemed like an upgrade on what she requested but since she had no time to really prepare for this seemingly large disappointment, I think you need to consider that while dealing with the disappointment you're also feeling. I do think this is a great opportunity for your relationship to learn how to handle miscommunication though since you both have feelings on it but there was no malice. Those don't come along very often. Also, ask if she'd like you to return it and get the sewing machine and go on holiday with the savings.

She\u2019s also the AH though because she completely dismissed the time and effort you put into trying to find her a gift that she would like and is being ungrateful about it.  And no Sarah, it is not like you asked for a book and got a kettle. \n\nI think the bigger issue here is your mismatch on wants and needs. She thinks it\u2019s ok to replace an item that isn\u2019t broken and you clearly don\u2019t. You should probably have a discussion about that - did she plan on having 2 machines or was she going to sell or donate her old one? If you knew what her plan was, maybe you would also be more ok getting her what she wanted. \n\nIf after all of that you didn\u2019t feel like replacing her usable machine, you could have gotten her a sewing machine with different features (there are different stitch types that usually require different equipment).

But when a gift recipient makes clear what they want, and the giver gets them something else (that\u2019s more expensive, so it wasn\u2019t because of the price) it makes the gift recipient feel unseen/unheard.

She's probably been thinking about what she could do with a new sewing machine. You disappointed her, and made her feel like you don't take her interests seriously (which it sounds like you don't tbh or you would have realised she might be disappointed.) Worse, you made her feel like you think you know better than her, and that you don't listen to her.\n\n You can still send it back and get her the sewing machine though; maybe offer to spend the difference on her for something else and let yourself be a a little vulnerable to her, yknow? It's not embarrassing that you cried; you wanted to do a big gesture and got invested in the idea of that, but you fucked up and you were sad and humiliated and disappointed too, it's ok, big feelings happen physically like that. It's ok to talk about that with the person you love and apologise and make amends.

But this is not how everyone thinks about gifts, especially as they get more expensive. To me, when someone gets me a gift I didn\u2019t expect and won\u2019t use, it\u2019s kind of a waste.

It sounds like you already established with your gf that you would get her the machine, and I\u2019m willing to bet she had projects planned for that machine. Now she doesn\u2019t have the tool she wanted, and instead has a new piece of expensive equipment that would require her to focus less on her sewing.

She told you exactly what she wanted, and you decided that you knew better.  I'm sure you had good intentions, but the issue here is that you bought something that YOU think is cool, rather than what she actually asked for.

A PS5 is a great gift.....but it's not what you actually wanted, and what you were looking forward to.  I understand the impulse to want to surprise her with what you think is a \"better\" gift, but when someone asks you for something specific (within reason of what you can find and afford, obviously), it's really better to just get them what they ask for.  They are asking for the item for a reason.  If you run into this issue again, just ask her.  \"Hey, I found this cool machine for crafting called a Cricut, would you like that instead of a sewing machine?\"  It might ruin the \"surprise\" but that's better than leaving her disappointed.", "YTA for thinking you know what your partner wants more than they do.", "YTA, but I feel like you already knew that.\n \nI\u2019m a seamstress and I can tell you that I, and almost every other sewist I know, have more than one machine.

I have one that\u2019s smaller and more basic that is my \u201ctraveling\u201d machine as well as a much fancier one that stays at home. \n\nCricuts are cool but not a tool used by every sewist. I have one and I rarely use it. It could\u2019ve been a good gift\u2026except for the fact that she told you exactly what she wanted and a Cricut isn\u2019t it. She was excited because she thought you\u2019d listened to her and gotten what she asked for. Of COURSE she was disappointed to find out you hadn\u2019t, especially because of how much you spent. The right course of action is to return the Cricut. If you\u2019re nervous about shopping for a machine without her, take her with you to pick one out.

You had good intentions, but you fell into the very dumb trap of \"I know what she wants better than she knows!\" which is ridiculous.  If someone wants something, it doesn't come down to cost or whatever else - it's what they're interested in for reasons they don't have to justify.  She asked for something for her birthday, which is normal, but you took it a step further by telling her in advance that you'd be getting it for her (I'm not sure why you did that...).  That set up expectations and, thus, disappointment.\n\nThat said, a gift is just that and it's only good manners to accept it and be polite and not argue about how you didn't get her what she wanted.  After the birthday dinner she could have gently expressed her disappointment (which, to me, centres on the fact that you lied and told her you'd get her something specific and then didn't do it), but she comes across as entitled in her wording.  She also shouldn't have looked up the cost at the dinner table and berated you publicly about how the money could have otherwise been used.\n\nYou're offended because she isn't using the gift she never wanted in the first place - that's the gamble with picking something that you don't know if the person is interested in.  She doesn't owe you for it, regardless of the cost.", "\nShe's upset because she doesn't think you listen to her.

Come time to open gifts, and she got you a very different, way more expensive console instead. Yeah it cost a lot of money, but you have no desire to use that console. All your accessories and materials are for this other console that you just wanted an updated version of.

And to be able to do all of those things you rattled off that it can do, it will take her months of learning and figuring it out before it\u2019s perfected. That means a lot of trial, error, and wasted material.

My 3rd is a serger, which I use together with my fancy one when making clothing/underwear, cloth pads and etc. They all serve their purpose, and sure I can get away with just 1, but having all 3 for the roles I use them for makes life simpler for me and my crafting. \nAlso, for more than half that amount of money if you *really* needed to go against what she asked for and got her die cut machine, you could\u2019ve gone with a silhouette portrait, that way if she didn\u2019t like it you would only be out a couple hundred rather than $1000+ \n\nI know it\u2019s the thought that counts, but sometimes when someone actually takes the time to hear you and get you something you\u2019ve been wanting for your bday; it can  make a person feel really loved and heard.", "I am going against the grain here.

She told you what she wanted for her birthday. You bought something else. It's a lot to ask someone to pretend they're incredibly excited that you bought something really expensive that they didn't want just to protect your feelings. If she's 'crafty' she's likely heard of Cricut before, too. They try to sell them to you *everywhere* in craft stores.

Not many features but they probably could still actually sew a seam. My grandmother had a very old Singer - so old that it was probably not even originally electric as it had some kind of pedal to start it although she didn't have to pump for power. My understanding is that many of the original old Singer machines were modified to electric in the early 20th century just as many gas lamps were modified to take electric bulbs rather than thrown away.

Getting someone a gift that's *too* expensive can make them  uncomfortable, especially if they can't reciprocate, and especially especially if you don't know whether they even want it.\n\nIt's good to be grateful when you receive gifts, but as a gifter you also have to remember that gifting is not about you, it's about the other person. OP thought a more expensive gift was automatically better, but their lack of thought towards their girlfriend ended up hurting her feelings, which, considering the circumstances, I can understand.", "Seriously!

I also get pretty ragey over wasteful consumption. Our family lives minimally and tries to buy responsibly. So when an older relative sends stuff that is useless, it just sets me on edge as to how wasteful all of it is. \n\nI appreciate the thought when it has genuine, actual thought. For example, we\u2019re cloth diapering this baby, and someone gifted us a cloth diaper with, \u201cI love you to the moon and back\u201d written on the bum of the diaper. That means so much to me, because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been saying to my first born for their entire life (nearly 17 years). Only one diaper, so it was about $12 for that person. But they knew how much I would love that and that\u2019s the thought I can appreciate. \n\nWhen genuine thought is put into getting something someone really needs/wants, no matter how low the cost, I always deeply appreciate it. \n\nBut I will never appreciate any gift where thought and consideration is completely left out, and they\u2019re just doing it to make them feel better about themselves. My Dad is a pretty absentee father. He\u2019s quite literally never gotten my kids a Christmas or birthday gift. 17 years. No gift. He\u2019s just trying to play the part of good father/grandfather because he has a new girlfriend.

Sometimes being able to pick it out yourself is enjoyable all by itself, and once you get past the most basic sewing machine, it would be hard for you to pick out which one she'd like the most, even if you also like to sew.\n\n**Can you return it and at least get enough money back to buy a midrange sewing machine?**\n\nGentle YTA.

The gf's reaction is unfortunate. But I do think that a lot of the comments to get it right that it was probably best to have kept with the sewing machine. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1) it's only the users call on whether a machine needs to be replaced, maybe hers was very old and getting worn out or she was wanting an upgrade or different features (yes sewing machines have features)\n\n2) lately there's big conversation around money/saving/inflation and I 100% agree with your girlfriend being unhappy with how much you spent, that's a lot of money that could have been used differently \n\n3) people are correct Cricuts are tedious and you have to really like it or want it and have to do crafts that it will be helpful for it to get the money's worth out of it.\n\n4) if it's time for her to replace her sewing machine then it would have been a nice gift for her to not have to spend money on replacing it and you would've have given her a very useful gift, now she has to spend money on replacing it.\n\nOnto of all of that I do feel like the not broken comment and her saying you don't listen to her reveals a trend. \n\nMy vote it YTA , however I don't think you're an A H I just think your incorrect in this situation.

I'd feel like I was demanding something specific. It was very much hammered into me as a child that if I received any gift, I should be grateful for what I was given. Some of my favorite gifts I've ever received were things I would not have thought to ask for. And I sympathize with OP's reaction of feeling hurt when a thoughtful gift is met with rejection.\n\nBut I realize that not everyone approaches gift giving the same way.

Machines aren't interchangeable.  Not when they're designed to do specialised tasks.  I'm not even talking about the matter of whether she wanted or not - I'm talking about the base-level *capability of using it*.  Your girlfriend sews.  That means all the crafting materials she has - the fabrics, threads, buttons, notions, ribbons, lace panels etc etc - are all materials for sewing.\n\nIt's also highly likely that she has multiple existing sewing projects on the go that she is trying to progress in one way or another.  I paint, sew, embroider, knit, am starting to crochet, and do a few other things besides.  Right now I have two half-finished shawls, various parts of a crochet rug waiting to be joined, two temperature blanket knitting projects, half an embroidered diary project that's been stalled for months, a partially-deconstructed chair I'm replacing the leather on, an entire shelf covered in jars of pickles, one squirrel skin I unsuccessfully tanned and have been trying to work out how to re-soften and a christmas cake that needs frosting.\n\nEven if she is a bit like me (basically 2 raccoons and a magpie in a trenchcoat, grabbing at everything shiny in my local yarn shop and stealing it away with no solid plan of a project), she may well not have any materials in storage that she can just pull out to use with the cricut.  And even if she does, and has fully decided to try and make use of the gift you got her, she's unlikely to have figured out how to use it, decided what she wants to use it for, learned what materials she needs, sorted them out of storage and started working on it *a mere day after her birthday*.  She probably wanted to spend her birthday doing things she enjoys, not pretending to enjoy an obligation-gift with an intimidatingly high price tag.\n\nIt was going to be N.A.H initially for me - what you did was well-meant, but not done with understanding of her interests, but by the same token she's allowed to not want a very expensive unasked-for device that she has no use for, especially since it sounds like it's not the norm for you to surprise each other with unexpected items.  But if you're feeling put out about her not using her gift this quickly after you got it *on top of that* then I have to say YTA.\n\nIt's giving the same vibe as when distant aunts would buy me these wildly expensive, intimidatingly fragile and fancy china dolls as a kid (I was a lego and books and drawing kid, never played with dolls once as far as I can recall) and then expect me to make a performance of pretending to play with it in front of them so they could feel happy.", "Did bro even show his nose in here after this question, or just slink off into the night? \n\nFor the record, OP, YTA.
