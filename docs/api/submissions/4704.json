{"id": 4704, "submission_id": "zltq76", "title": "AITA for getting my girlfriend a Cricut instead of a sewing machine?", "selftext": "Hi, I'm M26 and my girlfriend, Sarah is F27.  \nYesterday was Sarah's birthday. A couple weeks ago, she requested a sewing machine for her birthday gift. Even though she already had one (that was not broken), I agreed to get it for her. Since I'm a guy who knows nothing about sewing, I spent a a good 2 weeks of searching for a good model. In the end, I picked a Brother sewing machine along with some extra materials.\n\nJust when I was about to order it, I came across the Cricut Maker 3. For those who don't know, Cricut is something that can cut all kinds of things (e.g. fabric, wood, paper, leather). It can even engrave metal! It is used to make DIY projects like stickers, bags, mugs and necklaces.\n\nSince Sarah is very into crafting, I immediately thought she'd love it. In my opinion, it was way better than the sewing machine (since she already had one). Sure, the Cricut was double the price of the sewing machine (nearly $1000) but I had some money saved. \n\nAfter some research, I bought the Cricut with a Heat Press and other tools. I thought it would be an amazing birthday gift. I was about to tell Sarah that I didn't get the sewing machine - but knowing her, she would beg me to tell her what her new gift was. I wanted it a surprise so I decided to keep it a secret.\n\nFast forward to her birthday. Sarah was super excited. \n\nI gave her the present, saying that I didn't get the sewing machine but I got something even cooler. As I said those words, I could sense her disappointment but she was trying to hide it. I suddenly felt really bad but I hoped that she would like the Cricut.\n\nWhen she unwrapped the present, she looked even more disappointed. She said \"Thanks... I don't see why you couldn't get a sewing machine though. It isn't hard to get one.\" I was kinda put off by her 'unappreciation', but I apologised anyway. \n\nSarah continued - \"When you tell me what you want for your birthday, I get it for you. I didn't get you books when you said you wanted a kettle.\"\n\nI tried to explain what a Cricut could do, but she didn't really listen. She just pulled out her phone and Googled the price. When she found out I spent $1000+ on the present, she freaked out. She said that I could've gotten her *four* sewing machines for that price, or that I could've simply taken her on holiday. \n\nThis hurt me, because I did put in a lot of effort in my gift. It's embarrassing, but I suddenly was on the verge of tears. I don't cry much, but I felt emotional at that moment. When Sarah saw that, she said - \"Why are you crying? I do appreciate your present but it's just you totally disregarded what I wanted.\"\n\nShe left to give me some space, but we still had birthday dinner together. It was rather awkward but we pulled through.\n\nFast forward to today. Sarah still hasn't touched her Cricut. It's almost like she's trying to make a point that I really wasted my money on something she wouldn't use. \n\nI do feel a bit like an asshole because I did ignore what she wanted. But at the same time I feel I had good intentions...? \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671031253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zltq76/aita_for_getting_my_girlfriend_a_cricut_instead/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It takes a lot of time and energy to craft things with it, especially if you're a beginner.  Why would you buy something you knew nothing about or that she never asked for when you knew what she wanted? YTA", "YTA. She told you what she wanted, but you decided that you knew better. You decided that your take on it was far superior to hers, and that you knew better what she would enjoy than she did. Then, when she pointed out that she told you what she wanted, you got all hurt about it, and became the victim. Gross. \n\n\nYou have a deep lesson to learn here. I hope you take the time to learn it.", "> Fast forward to today. Sarah still hasn't touched her Cricut. It's almost like she's trying to make a point that I really wasted my money on something she wouldn't use.\n\nNo, she probably hasn't touched it because she didn't want it. You misjudged her interests and bought something she has no interest in, and did it on a gift well above the price point where you should check with somebody before buying it for them. Especially when it comes to crafting, something somebody doesn't really want rapidly becomes a chore instead of fun.\n\nYTA, a little bit, not because you tried to surprise your GF with a nice gift, but because you're showing a clear pattern of not actually thinking about what she wants and mistrusting her intentions. Return the Cricut and get her a sewing machine like she asked.", "YTA, she hasn't touched her Cricut you say? If I didn't know any better I'd say she doesn't want it nor have a use for it...", "I'm going to assume that your GF wants a sewing machine because she sews - as in she puts cloth together and uses the machine to attach them together.\n\nThe Cricut does the opposite - subtractive manufacturing.\n\nSomeone telling me what to get them would be the best thing ever. I suck at picking gifts. If my SO told me exactly what they wanted, that saves me from a potentially bad pick.\n\nYTA, but gently.", "YTA - you bought her something she had no interest in because *you thought it was cool and therefore she should use it.*\n\nBy the way, it's totally reasonable to own more than one sewing machine, especially when they have different features and can handle different types of projects. And to have them set up simultaneously to work on more than one thing at a time.\n\nYou're upset because YOU decided what she *should want*, and she hasn't touched it to. You do understand that her not being interested in the thing she doesn't want isn't an attack, right? Her having her own mind, and her own wants, and not yielding to what you attempt to impose on her isn't being passive aggressive. You bought her something she didn't want, and decided for her what she needs. That's asshole territory. She isn't a 3 year old.", "Gently, YTA. \n\nShe asked for something specific and a Cricut is much different than that of a sewing machine.\n\nIt does sound like you had good intentions, but if Sarah wanted a Cricut, she likely would've asked for one. \n\nMy advice would be to return it and shop for a sewing machine she actually wants together.", "YTA. She told you what she wanted. You ignored her and thought you knew better because she already had a sewing machine. There is a VAST difference in sewing machines - she likely has a basic one that can't handle heavy fabrics or do more complicated stitching. Bottom line, you IGNORED what she told you. Return the Cricut and get the sewing machine.", "Oh dear. Yta even though you didn't mean to be. First, being crafty doesn't mean the cricut is for you. I got one at a yard sale and it's amazing, but I rarely use it. It's only for specialized crafts. Second, being thoughtful can mean different things at different times and with different people. You thought about what she might want and tried to pick something she might like. That's a generous impulse. But in doing so you ignored what she actually said. Out loud. With words. That's a patronizing and AHish impulse. You think you know better than she does what she wants even when she's clear about what she wants. Don't do that.\n\nApologize. Take back the cricut, buy the sewing machine. In the meantime try to remember that this argument wasn't about the gift. It was about the lack of respect you unintentionally demonstrated.", "YTA. Both for buying her what she didn\u2019t want, AND for making it about the money. You\u2019re not gonna buy her love with money, you\u2019re going to earn it\u2014partly through respecting her opinions.", "YTA and presumably the issue is resolved by returning the Cricut and getting a sewing machine. \n\nA sewing machine is a very basic need for someone who wants a sewing machine. My mother had a sewing machine which she used quite a bit and would have had no need or interest in a Cricut because she had no interest in crafting but actually sewing - i.e. making her own clothing; altering my clothing. She did quilting but mostly handwork for her quilting.\n\nWhile there are inexpensive sewing machines that work, the more expensive machines can do amazing stuff. At this point, return the Cricut and take your girlfriend along to actually pick out the machine she wants based on the amount you want to spend. If she loves to sew and actually uses the machine, it is the kind of thing in which it sometimes pays to spend for features that make advanced sewing techniques possible.", "YTA.\nA generous one, but still... it feels kind of horrible for someone to ask you what kind of gift you want,  agree to it and then turn around get something you have never shown any interest in.  You chose something *you thought was cool* after promising to get what she wanted. \n\nYou asked her wishes and then ignored them. \n\nIn your shoes,  I would have asked some questions about what was wrong with the sewing machine she has- does it not have enough power? Does she want more stitching options? Is the motor approaching the end of its lifespan? Does she just want a second machine so she can more easily switch between heavy fabrics and more delicate material?", "She told you exactly what she wanted, a sewing machine, meaning her crafts are strictly fabric crafts. You disregard what she clearly asked for, got her something that doesn't align with the crafts she does, and expect her to be happy over it?\n\n\nThe only one you should be disappointed in is yourself. She even said that she gets you exactly what you ask for, so why couldn't you do the same for her?\n\n\nYTA", "YTA-Good intentions would be getting her what she asked for not deciding you know better than her about what she wants and getting that instead. It is the thought that counts but this kind of gift is thoughtless.", "\"Sarah still hasn't touched her Cricut. It's almost like she's trying to make a point that I really wasted my money on something she wouldn't use.\"\n\nShe didn't touch it because that's not what she needs for her project(s).  Stop projecting/assuming.\n\n\"I do feel a bit like an asshole because I did ignore what she wanted\"\n\nClearly sewing is an important hobby of hers and, whether her old sewing machine works or not, she's tired of it for whatever reason. I'm sure she's given you a reason why that you either forgot or aren't sharing.\n\nYeah, you researched a bunch.  Good for you, but that's not what she asked you to do.  I'm sticking with a soft YTA", ">I came across the Cricut Maker 3. For those who don't know, Cricut is something that can cut all kinds of things (e.g. fabric, wood, paper, leather).

You completely ignored your girlfriend skill set (sewing) and completely dismissed her ability to assess how good her own tools are (saying that a new sewing machine wasn't needed because she had one). \n\nEveryone who's saying N T A seems to miss how you completely don't have any respect for your girlfriend's skills or her ability to convey her needs.\n\nIt's incredibly rude of you to assume that you know better than her after a quick Google search what tools she needs and what is a better crafting machine. She literally told you. \n\nAnd now you have the audacity to be mad that she's not using a machine that she doesn't have an interest in nor knows how to use? You're again making her gift about you. Nothing you have done is selfless.\n\nYTA and maybe stick to giving gift cards if you're going to openly insult people with gifts like this.", "YTA - Instead of getting her something she wanted, you got her something you thought was cool. And not only that, you got her all excited to get the thing she actually wanted, only to let her down in the moment by giving her something she probably doesn\u2019t even know how to use. \n\nCricut is a totally different skill set than sewing. Just because someone is \u201ccrafty\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t take substantial time and effort to learn each crafting skill. I crochet and if someone got me a $1,000 set of knitting needles, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with them. It would take me a substantial amount of time and effort to learn. Because it\u2019s a skill set I don\u2019t already have.\n\nAnd now, when she\u2019s not spending the time to learn how to use a totally new thing that she didn\u2019t want or need just to make you feel better, you\u2019re in your head thinking she\u2019s not using it just to make a point to you.\n\nDo you not see how you\u2019re making this whole thing all about you?", "YTA Your intentions don't matter. You are an asshole for deciding you thought this would be a better gift. It is NOT the same thing, and it is NOT what she wanted/needed. You seem to be on some high horse because you spent more money, but she's right.", "YTA - Rule of thumb:  If you want to make someone happy on their birthday or Christmas, get them what they ask for\u2026", "YTA\n\nYou knowingly got her something she doesn't want or need. Just because she sews, it doesn't mean she is into any kind of craft. \n\nConsidering you still didn't exchange it and didn't get her what she wanted, and somehow see her as the guilty party for not enjoying it... Sucks.\n\nPS: what you did was perfectly intentional. You knew what she wanted. You got something random for her on purpose.", "YTA. Do you think you discovered Cricut? I don't craft, and I know what one is. They have been around for quite a while.\n\nYou realize you completely man-splained what a Cricut is and why she needs one more than a sewing machine, right?\n\nHere is the problem: \nI get that you may not know about a Cricut and thought it was a cool gadget, but why did you assume that she didn't know what one was or that she needed/wanted something she never mentioned before?  Why do you think she doesn't need a new sewing machine when you don't sew and specifically told you that is what she needs & wants? You aren't an expert on sewing or crafting, but you know better than her? She is pissed off b/c she listens to what you need/want and respects it. You don't reaspect what she needs/wants and think you know better. I'm guessing this isn't the first time you have done this nor is this kind of arrogance and dismissive behavior limited to gift giving.", "This is a classic example of the gift giver making it about them and not about what the recipient actually wants. This would be like if you asked for golf clubs and she got you a new bike. A cricut and a sewing machine are two completely different things. \n\nSoft YTA because this wasn\u2019t malicious but if you ask someone what they want for a gift, listen to them and don\u2019t get them something you think they \u2018should\u2019 want.", "YTA - The cricut, CAN do a lot... but it can't do what a sewing machine can do at all. I imagine she had a list of things she was looking forward to doing and none of them can be done right now. \n\nYou know what would have made everything better don't you? Communication. Instead you decided to surprise her because you thought you knew better and are still hanging on to the belief that the cricut is better than a sewing machine. But it can't sew! If she has old clothes she doesn't fot in anymore, the cricut can't alter them. The cricut can't make a quilt out of engraved wood or metal.", "Gently YTA for not getting the gift your GF requested. You obviously had good intentions, but when someone tells you what they want and you agree to get it for them, that is the gift you should get them. She was obviously really excited about the new sewing machine and her response was just the disappointment in realizing that you got her something she didn't ask for. Can you return the cricket and get the original sewing machine?", "YTA\nYour competent girlfriend who knows what she needs and wants in order to do what she wants to do told you what to get and you decided that her hobby wasn't good enough and instead she needs this other hobby that you deem cooler.\nFYI: I don't know any serious seamstress with just one machine.", "YTA.\n\nI was going to go E S H because there were far nicer ways for her to express her disappointment but one line gives me pause: \n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it was way better than a sewing machine.\u201d\n\nGifts aren\u2019t about what\u2019s better. They are about what holds the most meaning for the receiver. A simpler, more inexpensive tool can hold more meaning and usefulness for someone then a flashy expensive item they will never use.\n\nIt also sounds like you yourself are not a sewer. Sewing is a far different skill than decorating mugs.\n\nA sewer may work with leather and metal sparingly but they require separate skills. Someone who sews isn\u2019t going to automatically enjoy making stickers. Just because someone enjoys one form creativity doesn\u2019t mean they enjoy all types.\n\nYour opinion, especially as a non-sewer, shouldn\u2019t affect her gift as long as she\u2019s asking for something in budget. \n\nThe line I quoted makes you come across as if you knew better than your girlfriend.

You agreed to buy her a sewing machine. Then, you instead bought a completely different machine with a big learning curve and all these attachments for it that have nothing to do with sewing.

She wants to sew, which is why she asked for a new sewing machine. She does not want to do heat transfers. \n\n(Also, all of y\u2019all in the comments saying we don\u2019t get to pick our gifts: have you never put together an Amazon wish list or wedding / baby registry?

I can be 100% clear on something I want and he\u2019ll go pick out something that\u2019s kind of like what I wanted but totally opposite. He gets distracted by something he thinks I might like versus just getting the thing I 100% want. \n\nSo I don\u2019t love getting presents anymore. And then, he\u2019s hurt because I\u2019m not excited. \n\nSelfish? Maybe. But I try to get him what he wants or even let him order it himself so he gets EXACTLY what he wants. I\u2019d just like a little bit of the same consideration in return. \n\nAll that to say, start listening to her NOW. Change your course NOW. Return the Cricut and get her a nice sewing machine and a gift card to a fabric store or sewing supply store she talks about.", "YTA. \n\nReturn the Circuit, get the sewing machine and her favorite flowers. Show that you listen to her and care about her preferences.", "YTA- she specifically said she wanted a sweing machine and you bought something completely different. She will probably never use that Cricut now because it's associated with her disappointment and your disregard for her wishes. If you are able to return the Cricut, get your money back and get her the best sewing machine you can afford. Do all of this while she's out of the house ASAP. Use whatever money you have left to take her out for a nice weekend getaway to someplace SHE would really enjoy if you hate it that's even better. You will smile and love every minute of it.

I have one. You know how many steps there are to Cricut projects? At minimum, you need to find or make files, then get this big heavy machine out where there\u2019s open room, hook up your computer, cut out image, pick out tiny little bits, deal with this big annoying sticky mat, oh and YOU NEED A PROJECT IN MIND before you start any of this?? Like yeah you can make lots of things, it\u2019s a great tool, but it\u2019s still just a tool. If she doesn\u2019t want to make stickers, it doesn\u2019t matter that it makes stickers.

It was fine for her to be disappointed, but the proper reaction to getting a gift is always to be thankful and appreciative, and it is certainly not to google the price and complain that she would rather have been taken on a vacation with that (very generous) amount of money.\n\nThe proper reaction on her part would have to be appreciative in the moment. Then to consider whether the machine would actually be something she could use. Then, if she decided the answer was no, to go to bf a couple days later and very politely explain that while she really appreciates the thought, she is fairly sure she won't really have use for the machine, and see if perhaps it could be returned and she could put the money towards a sewing machine instead.", "NTA. I understand her disappointment, it wasn't what she asked for but you didn't choose a different option to be malicious! Gift-giving is all about the thought. One time for my birthday my partner got me a locket with a cardinal bird on it. Honestly, it's big and clunky and not my taste. But he got it for me because cardinal birds remind me of my late grandmother who I was really close with and he wanted to surprise me with something meaningful. I don't wear it often, but I do have it displayed nicely on my dresser so I can see it every day because the thought behind that gift was incredibly sweet and meaningful. You tried to do something nice and she's allowed to be disappointed she didn't get the sewing machine, but this reaction? Out of proportion and honestly just kind of bratty. You tried to do something very sweet and she didn't appreciate it in the slightest... that's sad. Definitely NTA.", "Wow NTA at all\u2026 can\u2019t believe all these replies.\n\nFor a crafty person, a cricut is an awesome gift. You put a lot of thought into it and for all you knew, she wanted it but didn\u2019t ask for it because of the price.\n\nShe was so rude about not getting exactly what she wanted - it\u2019s childish and appalling.\n\nMy family never buys gifts from a list (except for me) and I couldn\u2019t imagine verbally expressing disappointment about that. It\u2019s a gift???? Especially when so much thought is put into it.\n\nJust return it and get the sewing machine I guess, but she really handles this poorly.", "ESH. You because you deliberately disregarded what your girlfriend specifically told you she wanted and got her something else for no good reason. And your girlfriend for reacting to shitty to what you intended to be a thoughtful gift.", "NTA,\n\nDamn all these people who think you're entitled to a gift and exactly what you want.

Shit like this happens. So now just return the circuit and buy the sewing machine. All done, all better. And in the future if you find something that you think it's better, discuss it with her. Like I was looking for a book. Couldn't find it. Asked my husband to find it. My husband suggested kindle prescription, u wasn't aware this was a thing years ago, and now I have access to all the books. In this case, this was a better option.\nBut what you did was like if I asked for a specific book and my husband got me a movie based on that book.", "NTA\n\nFFS... in order to not be an AH on reddit regarding gifts, everyone would do better to just give gift cards.\n\nYou obviously thought your gf would appreciate the Circuit as she's crafty.  It's not like you went to the gas station and bought her windshield wipers!  Gifts used to be about showing someone you care by putting thought and effort into choosing a gift for them.  According to reddit, gifts are now required to be the exact specifications demanded by the receiver.\n\nIf she doesn't intend to use the Circuit, give her the receipt and have her return it and get what she wants.  This is the way things have gone since the commercialization of events and holidays.\n\nKudos for putting thought and consideration into what you wanted to give to your gf.", "NTA. I\u2019m going against the grain here but I think you had your heart in the right place, it was a really cool gift and since she is so crafty you thought she would love it. I kind of find it rude that she went and googled the price. That being said, as she is so upset though, might be better to return that gift and get her what she wanted. But I definitely do not think you\u2019re an asshole.", "NTA, it\u2019s a gift, while she can make suggestions, she can\u2019t dictate what you buy her and she was extremely ungrateful in receiving your expensive gift. She\u2019s acting very bratty and entitled, I\u2019d be reconsidering if I wanna spend more of my life with this person who doesn\u2019t even know how to politely say thank you when they receive a gift. It\u2019s the epitome of rudeness when you blatantly reject a gift, and to Google the price in front of you!! Wow!! Incredibly rude.

A couple weeks ago, she requested a sewing machine for her birthday gift. Even though she already had one (that was not broken), I agreed to get it for her. Since I'm a guy who knows nothing about sewing, I spent a a good 2 weeks of searching for a good model. In the end, I picked a Brother sewing machine along with some extra materials.\n\nJust when I was about to order it, I came across the Cricut Maker 3. For those who don't know, Cricut is something that can cut all kinds of things (e.g. fabric, wood, paper, leather). It can even engrave metal! It is used to make DIY projects like stickers, bags, mugs and necklaces.\n\nSince Sarah is very into crafting, I immediately thought she'd love it. In my opinion, it was way better than the sewing machine (since she already had one). Sure, the Cricut was double the price of the sewing machine (nearly $1000) but I had some money saved. \n\nAfter some research, I bought the Cricut with a Heat Press and other tools. I thought it would be an amazing birthday gift. I was about to tell Sarah that I didn't get the sewing machine - but knowing her, she would beg me to tell her what her new gift was. I wanted it a surprise so I decided to keep it a secret.\n\nFast forward to her birthday. Sarah was super excited. \n\nI gave her the present, saying that I didn't get the sewing machine but I got something even cooler. As I said those words, I could sense her disappointment but she was trying to hide it. I suddenly felt really bad but I hoped that she would like the Cricut.\n\nWhen she unwrapped the present, she looked even more disappointed. She said \"Thanks... I don't see why you couldn't get a sewing machine though. It isn't hard to get one.\" I was kinda put off by her 'unappreciation', but I apologised anyway. \n\nSarah continued - \"When you tell me what you want for your birthday, I get it for you. I didn't get you books when you said you wanted a kettle.\"\n\nI tried to explain what a Cricut could do, but she didn't really listen. She just pulled out her phone and Googled the price. When she found out I spent $1000+ on the present, she freaked out. She said that I could've gotten her *four* sewing machines for that price, or that I could've simply taken her on holiday. \n\nThis hurt me, because I did put in a lot of effort in my gift. It's embarrassing, but I suddenly was on the verge of tears. I don't cry much, but I felt emotional at that moment. When Sarah saw that, she said - \"Why are you crying? I do appreciate your present but it's just you totally disregarded what I wanted.\"\n\nShe left to give me some space, but we still had birthday dinner together. It was rather awkward but we pulled through.\n\nFast forward to today. Sarah still hasn't touched her Cricut. It's almost like she's trying to make a point that I really wasted my money on something she wouldn't use. \n\nI do feel a bit like an asshole because I did ignore what she wanted. But at the same time I feel I had good intentions...? \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Per your post, I can see you put effort into finding a sewing machine, but that wasn\u2019t the gift you gave.", "Yta - I\u2019m a crafter too. Don\u2019t get me wrong the present you got her is a great but she wanted a new sewing machine.", "I am a fairly heavy Circuit user, and YTA.\n\nTo put it into perspective, you got her a CNC mill when she asked for a drill press. Sure, it might do similar, but it is absolutely not the same.", "YTA. She wanted a sewing machine and you got her something else she didn\u2019t want bc you know better and get then offended when she doesn\u2019t use it?!! \n \nIt\u2019s like getting someone roller blades when they wanted skates bc they can\u2019t roller blade bc it hurts the feet and then getting mad bc they won\u2019t willingly hurt their feet to use the gift they didn\u2019t want", "YTA. She told you what she really wanted. You ignored her. Return that thing and take her sewing machine shopping so she can choose for herself. This isn\u2019t rocket science.", "YTA,\n\nShe hasn't touched it because she is not interested.  You should be gotten the sew machine like she wanted and get over sewing accessories to go along with it.\n\nNext time when she asks for example a specify book, don't buy her a dictionary.  Because a dictionary is better because it has all the words.", "YTA. \n\nListen, people should be gracious when they get gifts they don't want, but also if you have an agreement where you will get people what they ask for, you are an AH for going against it. \n\nYour girlfriend asked for a sewing machine and you AGREED (literally what you say) to get her one. That means she expected one and didn't ask anyone else for that gift. You could have said no, or even \"we will see\" but you agreed that is what you were getting her and she got excited to have a new one.  It doesn't matter if she already has one that you deem works fine. Maybe it doesn't work that well and you wouldn't know that because you don't sew on it,  maybe it doesn't do the things she wants, maybe overall she wants a new model. I have a car that works fine and at some point I'm getting a new one, even if this one runs. \n\nYou are the one who got excited to get her something that you think is cool, with zero regards to her own interests or what you agreed to. And it is even more frustrating that it costs more because she didn't want it at all. She wanted to sew, not like...work with metal. \n\nAnd now you are bothered she isn't using it, when she never asked for it and also told you to your face she didn't like it. The shock!", "YTA. People who tell you they want sewing machines really want sewing machines.", "YTA. Idk why you felt that you knew what she wanted more than she does.", "You meant well, but ultimately she is right. She told you what she wanted, and I question her a bit about this, because as you noticed, sewing machines are not such a simple thing, so maybe a bit more guidance would have been good.\n\nBut you decided to go a totally different way, which sounds like you put a lot of thought into it. But yeah seems like you misjudged a bit.\n\nI will call NAH, because you meant well, and she expected different. Things happen", "NAH - why not just return the thing and all it\u2019s items and get get the sewing machine? You took a swing trying to get something \u2018better\u2019 and it was a miss. \n\nApologize, tell her you\u2019re returning it, and ask her if there\u2019s anything specific she wants in the new sewing machine. Take an interest in her interests", "YTA. All crafts are not interchangeable. \n\nIf your GF doesn't do any crafts that she would use a Cricut for, then the gift was not useful for her. She told you what she wanted and would use: a sewing machine.\n\nI own both a sewing machine and a cutting machine similar to a Cricut. That's because I make different crafts with each. I got my cutting machine after years of cutting shapes by hand (either scissors, xacto knives, or manual die cuts). I only made the investment after I determined it was worth the money and time to use it (it's a tad temperamental). However, it still spends lots of time in my closet because even I only need it a few times a year.\n\nYour GF hasn't used the gift because she doesn't do those kinds of craft projects. She does sew, which is why she wanted a nice sewing machine. You didn't listen, but now are upset that she isn't using a craft machine that she never wanted.\n\nWould *I* love to be gifted hundreds of dollars of Cricut products? Absolutely, because it would be a big step up for stuff I already use. But again, it's because that's in my craft wheelhouse. It's not in your GF's. She likes to sew, so that's what she would appreciate.", "YTA\n\n>A couple weeks ago, she requested a sewing machine for her birthday gift.\n\n>I feel I had good intentions...? \n\nGood intentions would be getting her the sewing machine she requested. It doesn't matter that she already has a sewing machine or that Cricuts can do a million different things. It's not what she wanted. \n\nIf possible just return the stuff you bought. Ask Sarah which specific sewing machine she wants and get it. Just listen to her next time.", "YTA. She didn't ask for a Cricut. She doesn't do the sorts of crafts that are made with a Cricut. She told you exactly what she wanted AND you told her you'd get it for her - so she had an expectation there....\n\nYou didn't get it for (as promised). You got her something she doesn't use or probably even know HOW to use. You didn't get her what she wanted and instead got her something YOU wanted (or at least thought was cooler). You failed in Gift Giving 101 - which is consider what the RECIPIENT needs or wants... not the giver.", "YTA. Looks like you bought something that you thought was cool.", "YTA She specifically asked for one thing and you got another, something she most likely won\u2019t even use. And now your feelings are hurt because YOU chose not to listen. You spent more money and time researching and purchasing something she never wanted. It\u2019s not like she wasn\u2019t clear about it.", "YTA\nCricut is so different from sewing machine. No wonder she's not using it. I like embroidery and if you gave me this instead of embroidery hoop I wouldn't know what to do with it. There are so many different types of crafting and each of them need different tools and materials. You should've given her what she wanted, not what you wanted her to have.", "Oh pal, I actually feel so bad for you, I think you've upset yourself but thought you were doing something that she would love. So for that reason YTA, but clearly not malicious, just misguided. \n\nI think in the future a surprise present would be better as a small side along present. So for example, main present sewing machine which was asked for, and a surprise present is some flowers. \n\nEither return or sell the cricut, buy her a sewing machine and if there's much difference maybe go spend a weekend together to properly bury the hatchet.", "I'm confused. Sewing machines attach fabric to fabric, and can range from super simple to super complex. They are for making clothes or quilts, or even embroidery.  Cricut is sort of an ultra fancy paper cutter plus ironing board. How did you jump from one to the other in your head? They're not remotely the same type of crafting. It's like asking for a bicycle and being given an expensive hang glider instead.\n\nI'm voting YTA because you decided that you know her mind and crafting preferences better than she does. That's never going to go over well. I'd suggest you return the Cricut and take her shopping for her dream sewing machine with all the bells and whistles.", "YTA. Just another somebody that thinks they know better what someone else likes and wants. Very disappointing.", "NTA a birthday WISH list is just that a wish list. It\u2019s not for people to demand what others GIFT them. Do you have a habit of disregarding her wants? Based on what you wrote it doesn\u2019t seem like it. She already has a working item of what she wanted, you were going to get her that item but, found something you thought she would like and would be a surprise. She also didn\u2019t specify the sewing machine she wanted so how were you to know that she wanted that no ifs and it buts about it.\n\nI think her attitude was wrong and ungrateful. As a crafting person she would likely love it but chose to throw a pity party and make you feel bad instead. If she really wouldn\u2019t use it than she could have been much kinder and diplomatic in her delivery of that message. \n\nWith her attitude though return the stuff, get her a sewing machine and think hard about the relationship. If this is a one off or a pattern of hers.", "NAH. It was a very generous gift and I'm sure your heart was in the right place, but at the same time, she told you clearly what she wanted and that wasn't it. Can the Cricut be returned? If it's still in the box and you have the receipt, the store should take it back. Then you can get her the sewing machine she really wants.", "YTA. Return it fool. Get her the sewing machine and plan a weekend getaway with the extra money leftover.", "What Cricut costs $1k? I thought $300 tops.", "YTA and here's why:\n\n>I tried to explain what a Cricut could do, \n\nYou admit you know nothing about sewing, yet took it upon yourself to disregard her request and buy her a completely different type of machine because YOU thought it was better. Then you tried to mansplain to her why she should be grateful for your *superior* decision. Get over yourself.", "YTA- a circuit and sewing machine cannot even do the same thing. She is *not* making a point by not using, she doesnt craft that way!", "My suggestion: sit her down. Tell her you love how creative and crafty she is. You came across the circuit and, when reading about what it does, it made you think of her because it can do so many neat things and you imagined all the unique and interesting things she could create with it. Now you understand it is not something she is really interested in and you will happily return it and she can pick out the sewing machine she wants.\n\nI get it - it\u2019s kind of disappointing when you choose a gift for someone special by putting a lot of thought into who they are and that connection is not recognized. She is thinking you were not listening to her when you were actually thinking about her interests and personality when you bought the gift. Hopefully you guys can use the opportunity to bolster communication skills.", "Soft YTA. I'm not a fan of telling people what to get me, and I think this was a very thoughtful gift. However, you told her you were getting her a sewing machine, so I understand her disappointment.", "Gentle YTA. If you ask someone what they want, they tell you, it's really disappointing when they don't get what they wanted. If you aren't going to listen, don't bother asking. My family used to do this to me all the time. Birthdays and Christmas, they'd ask what I wanted. I'd tell them specifically. They either didn't bother, or get me a generic version of what I wanted or something vaguely similar. It really is a let down.  \nFor example, I'm a crocheter. I got given a knitting kit because it's the same, right? Wrong. Totally different skill.", "YTA. She wanted something specific and you got her something totally different.", "The road to misery is paved with good intentions. Sorry, YTA.", "YTA. Your ego is getting in the way. First you didn't listen to or understand your girlfriend well enough to get WHY she wanted a new sewing machine even though she already has one. How old is her current one? Does it work well? What kind of features does it have? What kinds of projects does she want to do with it? Does she already have projects in progress that she has materials and plans for that the new machine was supposed to help her accomplish? \n\nYou don't seem to understand why the answers to any of those questions might be important. You just assumed that her request was stupid because you hadn't taken the time to ask her why she wanted it. Instead you found a different machine that was better according to YOUR criteria; but you don't even know why she wanted a sewing machine, so your criteria are completely irrelevant. Then, when you had a chance to check with her about it first and make sure she wanted it, you decided not to, because it was more important to you that you pulled off a surprise than that she actually get a gift she enjoys. \n\nYour priorities are out of whack. Gifts are supposed to show the recipient that you are thinking about what's important to them and what they like. The point of giving a gift is not to spend a lot of money or make yourself look cool for picking something out. You're making this all about YOU instead of her.", "Even though your intentions were good, YTA. A Cricut is a cool thing and there's a bunch of things you can do with it, none of them are sewing, which is your GF's hobby.

She's also TA a little because of her displaying her disappointment and not acknowledging that to a layman, this seemed like an upgrade on what she requested but since she had no time to really prepare for this seemingly large disappointment, I think you need to consider that while dealing with the disappointment you're also feeling. I do think this is a great opportunity for your relationship to learn how to handle miscommunication though since you both have feelings on it but there was no malice. Those don't come along very often. Also, ask if she'd like you to return it and get the sewing machine and go on holiday with the savings.  Surely knowing she'd rather spend time with you than have such an expensive gift will soothe some feelings", "YTA you decide in relationships with people if you are the request a specific gift and give it sort of people or you are the get a surprise sort of people, and both are fine but you cant decide to be one and do the other and expect everything to be chill.

And no Sarah, it is not like you asked for a book and got a kettle. \n\nI think the bigger issue here is your mismatch on wants and needs. She thinks it\u2019s ok to replace an item that isn\u2019t broken and you clearly don\u2019t. You should probably have a discussion about that - did she plan on having 2 machines or was she going to sell or donate her old one? If you knew what her plan was, maybe you would also be more ok getting her what she wanted. \n\nIf after all of that you didn\u2019t feel like replacing her usable machine, you could have gotten her a sewing machine with different features (there are different stitch types that usually require different equipment).

But when a gift recipient makes clear what they want, and the giver gets them something else (that\u2019s more expensive, so it wasn\u2019t because of the price) it makes the gift recipient feel unseen/unheard.
