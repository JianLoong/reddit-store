I was disappointed but didn't bring it up because what I got from others was amazing and I was grateful for what I had.\n\nFor my 24th birthday (Sept 1) it was repeated, he didn't get me a gift, this time I brought it up in a not super pushy way. His response was \"You should be grateful I'm even here, you fat ugly wh0re\" I assume he said this because my then fiance now husband came from a wealthy family and he showers me in gifts/love (I love him sm, and I'm very grateful). I brushed it off and kept enjoying my birthday.\n\nLast week was his 22nd birthday and I had recently got a promotion and since I had spare money, I splurged on his gift. By then I had moved past most of what he said. He loves all things dinosaur and wants to be an archeologist, I spent around 200$ on the skull of a fox sized dinosaur skull from a certified skeleton store. On the bottom was a little authentication sign and an info card.\n\nWhen his birthday came around we all gathered and we all had a great time until it got to gift opening, when it was my gift he picked up, he had a mild look of disgust but opened it regardless, when he saw the gift he said \"See this is probably a fake plastic replica, her broke ass couldn't afford a real skull, and if her husbands rich why didn't he buy it\" and he tossed it onto the couch. I picked it up showed him the label and loudly read about what it was and where it was from, then I showed him it was read by gifting it back to him so he could feel the bone. After that he giggled and said \"oops\" ALL HE SAID WAS OOPS!! \n\nImmediately I snatched the gift and me and my fiance left. From then my aunt and uncle and most of the family kept messaging me saying how he doesn't think before he speaks and to give it back and he's so sad and because he didn't understand why he didn't get the gift (I'm assuming they said this because he's neurodivergent, but I don't think that's fair) \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669514880, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5oonz/aita_for_taking_away_my_disabled_cousins_birthday/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My family is saying he doesn't understand that I need to stop being a bitch and get over what he said and that it made him sad and left out because he didn't get gift from me, even though he didn't buy me gifts for the last two years and still bought everyone else one.\n\n**[Check out our upcoming Reddit Talk with Iliza Shlesinger on Nov. 28th!](https://redd.it/z29rfu)** \n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My whole family is neurodivergent. We're just not AHs... He is.", "NTA\n\nIt's funny that his parents didn't seem to care about following the family tradition 2 years in a row for your birthday.  They didn't seem to care he called you a whore, but they are soooo upset he didn't get his gift due to his behavior.  While I wouldn't have asked him why he didn't, but I kind of feel he did it as a statement si maybe bait you so he could lash out at you.\n\n\nHim being autistic doesn't mean he can call you a whore and treat your gift like shit while insulting you and your fiance.  He has likely never been taught to take any accountability because him and his parents use autism as an excuse for anything bad he does.  \n\n\nIt's called consequences for actions.  He called you a whore and honestly if it were me, I would have skipped his birthday all together this year.", "Nta. So nta.\n\nI hate it when people blame their shitty behavior on mental issues. Autism does not cause people to be assholes. He doesn't think before he speaks but that doesn't mean that autism controls his thoughts.\n\nHe was ungrateful, for a thoughtful gift. You had every right to leave and take it back.", "You know that it doesn't matter that he's disabled, right? I'm autistic and I would never just be that rude to someone.", "He's being abusive and doesn't deserve the gift. NTA.", "NTA. Being neurodivergent doesn't allow you to be an AH. He is giving autistic people a bad name. I have a few autistic friends, and I think they would find this kind of behaviour appalling.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s autistic, but that doesn\u2019t mean he gets away with being an a-hole! He\u2019s spoiled and I\u2019m sure he gets away with a lot of things in his life because people overcompensate for him being autistic. This in fact is a disservice to him and those around him. \n\nReturn that gift you bought for a refund at the store. Get a cheap plastic dino from the dollar store and give that to him since he had such low expectations of your gifts. And just say something like ... \u201chere you go. Last time you said you expected a plastic dinosaur right? Happy bday!\u201d", "NTA. Your cousin needs to learn his lesson.\n\nAlso, as an autistic person, I would never dream of acting this way. His behaviour is not representative of neurodivergents. What it *is* representative of, though, is a brat.", "Yeah no big fat NTA. Based on this post I asume he disrespecting you and calling you very insulting names is a common occurance. \n\nThe whole \"you should be gratful Im even here\" I applaud you for keeping your cool that time someone told me to my face that I would have told them to leave and ban them from any event Im hosting. \n Even if the present was cheap (which it wasnt he just assumed the worst) that gives him no right to treat it with such disrespect. \n\nHis neurodivergance doesnt excuse his attitude and actions. It explains them (even then not fully) but doesnt justify them, I suspect your familly is used to cuddling him and excusing his horrible behavior this could be the first time he has actually been given consequences and thats why he is not getting it.", "NTA. Most of my family and friends are autistic, I'm also neurodivergent. Never in a million years would I let this shit slide. Have you told anyone what he said previously?", "NTA \n\nIf he doesn't understand, his parents should take the time to explain it to him. That's their job, not matter how much it surprises them they have to actually parent a neurodivergent kid, and that it takes effort, not caving every time the kid has a fit because he suddenly has consequences.", "NTA.\n\nHe's an ungrateful brat who deserves to be taught a lesson which should be \"bad behaviour is not rewarded,\" disability or not. \n\nAlso, I see some people here saying \"It's rude to take back a gift once it's been given\". While I see what they're saying, throwing it to the ground in a huff was him saying he didn't want it, no?", "NTA. I don't care what kind of issues he or his family says that he has, but if anyone in my family ever called me anything like that, I would never, ever speak to them again much less by them an expensive and exotic gift. I'm glad you took that gift back.", "NTA autism isn\u2019t an excuse for rude behavior. My cousin, whom I\u2019m very close to, has an aunt on her other side who is \u2018autistic\u2019 and always says the most horrible stuff and everyone just shrugs and says she\u2019s autistic. She made my cousin cry at her own wedding. I hate that woman with a deep and abiding passion.", "NTA.\n\nBeing autistic doesn't excuse his behavior. His simply an ah.", "Absolutely NTA! You're right the title sounds awful but as an autistic person autism does NOT give you an excuse to treat people like crap. Not only has he been incredibly rude to you, he literally insulted you and your gift. He didn't even apologize! Don't let your relatives make you feel bad for this, he doesn't get to be cruel because of his autism.", "NTA. Autistic doesn\u2019t mean you get to be abusive. His family enables him and he\u2019s going to be a nightmare when his parents die off and he has to take care of himself", "Autism is not an excuse to be an abusive AH. I'm assuming he was enabled his whole life, but as they said fuck around and find out. He did just that. Ooops.  \nNTA", "Info. Where are you getting a dinosaur SKULL for $200?

That's theft imo. A lot of people feel a sort of entitlement to the things they've bought, but I don't think that's right. I don't think you're a massive asshole because you took it away immediately and he didn't, like, Idk, own it for long enough for me to feel like it was his, he owned it for like 30 seconds.
