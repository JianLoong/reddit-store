Way back in the way back, I was a single mom and had to travel on business about once a month, so I had a sitter stay at my place to watch my kiddo. One month my parents were in town and offered to stay for the week. Grateful as it saved me some $$. When I got home, my mom informed me she had done my laundry and was surprised that I had no underwear. I'm like, Mom, what do you think was in my suitcase with me? Oops ... So fast forward a couple of weeks and I get a package delivered to my office from my mom. My secretary was all excited and had me open it right away. Inside was a bunch of pretty lacy panties from VS.

It's all from good intentions, but the result is still awful for everyone. Yet, I seriously do not believe she gets upset to be be manipulative, even if that's what it ends up being.", "I am VERY close to my mom and grandma, and it would never occur to either one of them to get into anyone's bags and do our laundry for us! I even read this to my mom and she was aghast. (She would lose her mind if Grammy dug around in her stuff and did her laundry).\n\nOP is 30 and lives away from her mom. It is not okay to get into packed luggage and wash someone else's clothes! Especially if you aren't going to read care labels and put cashmere in the dryer.", "I have a normal relationship with my parents, thank you very much, and neither of them would dream of going through my stuff without asking. They do nice things for us all the time. But they ask first, because they're normal.", "My well intentioned mother washed my clothes for me, time to go no co \ud83d\ude02I do this for my daughter, but I just pick them up off the floor. My mom still does this for me, although arguably, I should be past throwing them on the floor. But I do appreciate packing, clean, folded clothes. \ud83d\ude0a", "That's my point. Nobody does it.", "You can have kind intentions but your actions can still make you an AH, in this case it was nice for the mom to want to wash OP's clothes but, like you say, OP is 30, she can take care of her own things and not have to worry whether everything can be packed away the night before her flight.", "[Bot](https://old.reddit.com/user/Primaethj) stole [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a2mv4/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_violated_my_privacy/j9pfor5/)", "> Yet, I seriously do not believe she gets upset to be be manipulative, even if that's what it ends up being.\n\nShe is absolutely being manipulative. \n\nYou think her intention is \"I want to make my family happy\", which means any consequence can be excused because the intention is good.\n\nBut her intention is actually \"I want to make *myself* happy by doing this task\".  You've voiced to her multiple times that the task does not make *you* happy, but she doesn't care. If it makes her happy, she doesn't care if it makes you sad. \n\nA rational response to pointing this out would be a discussion and agreement. But by getting upset and escalating every discussion into a fight, she's able to circumvent that discussion AND make you feel bad for her. She may not even realize the reasons she's doing this. But that doesn't change the fact that she's doing it, and more importantly - does not care about how it affects you.", "Yeah doing that to my cashmere sweater would just really make me angry as well.", "I'm 35... and just visited my folks a week after new year... I even got to stay in my old bedroom... Yep MY mom did all my laundry when I was at work with my old man... did not have to ask and DID not flip the eff out on her either...", "so you think op wears dirty clothes every day until she flies home to visit her mom? lmao bffr", "Whatever troll", "> You can have kind intentions but your actions can still make you an AH, \n\n100% agree with you and I'm not excusing the mother's actions but its a balance - it it worth getting yourself and your mother upset over something that might not be as big of a deal?  And its a trip - you kinda have to expect that somethings will go not as planned, its where the best stories come from :)", "if she didn't smell mom wouldn't have washed. Think about it."]}
