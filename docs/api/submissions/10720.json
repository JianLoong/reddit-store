On the night before I flew back, I went out with some friends. I came home to find my suitcase empty. I mildly panicked because my flight was early the next morning. I asked my mom about it and she was washing the clothes. It was late, like close to midnight, and they were still drying. And she washed my cashmere sweater which I only dry clean. \n\nI was noticeably irritated. I kept asking where my stuff was and was getting anxious about not knowing if everything was accounted for. \n\nI felt bad after I calmed down. I told my mom that while the gesture was nice, I don\u2019t want her going through my things without asking. She started crying and told me to hang out with my dad since \u201cI never get mad at him\u201d. I feel like I ruined our last night together and that I should have just kept my mouth shut. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the feedback. Yes she has done things like this before, now that I reflect, I don\u2019t think she ever gave me a healthy amount of privacy. I moved out when I was 17 and I don\u2019t see her a lot, so it just felt really bad to make her cry, especially since doing a chore for someone could be seen as motherly.

I'm someone who cries super fucking easily, at everything, as much as a try not to. During a conflict even more easily, even when I'm wrong and I know it. I try not to and I will apologize. I don't mean to manipulate anyone by crying, I feel even worse because it's bringing an apology back to myself, and hate it. Maybe the mom is super emotional as I am? And yes, she should've apologized, washing the clothes, the night before, without consent, sucks)."]}
