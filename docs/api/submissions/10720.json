There\u2019s no way a logical person wouldn\u2019t realize this is totally inappropriate and seriously inconvenient for you if you\u2019re leaving the next morning. This is manipulation, pure and simple.", "NTA and I want to gently suggest that your mom might have issues with emotional manipulation. My mom cries and says cheap things like this. I'm 42 years old and have only just recently (with my husband's help) started to recognize and accept that she is emotionally abusive and has legitimate narcissistic tendencies. I had no idea but now everything makes sense.", "NTA - You are 30, not 13.  Your mother should respect that.  Your reaction was perfectly valid at every step.", "NTA. You were packed and ready, she unpacked you and washed your clothes (probably ruining an expensive sweater) and made you stay up late\u2026..and she is upset? \n\nNTA but you mom sure is! She definitely needs to be told to leave your stuff alone!", "NTA. Crying and saying what she did was manipulation to get you to feel like you ruined the night together. All you did was reinforce a boundary that you are most definitely allowed to have. Don't let her guilt you.", "NTA. No matter how innocent her intentions were, she should ask first. My daughter is 12 and I respect her privacy and get consent before potentially crossing boundaries.", "NTA - Your expectation of privacy is perfectly reasonable at your age.", "**NTA**\n\nWhat your mother did was completely and utterly inappropriate, period. \n\nContrary to what others are saying, it was NOT a \"nice gesture\". If she had wanted to make a nice gesture it would in fact have been EASIER for her to simply MAKE THE OFFER to do your laundry at any point during your visit. Instead, she waited until the last possible moment, when you were out of the house, to go through your things without your permission (intrusive, massive invasion of privacy, and completely irrational given that it sounds like you were mostly packed to leave already), unpack your bags, and wash everything without your consent and without even checking about laundering instructions. And then when you very appropriately pointed out how unbelievably inappropriate, unhelpful, and just plain odd her actions were, she pulled out the tears on cue, which was wildly manipulative, instead of just apologising.\n\nI don't know if this behaviour is par for the course for her, but it doesn't even really matter. There was nothing helpful about it. It was super invasive, and her reaction to your VERY appropriate response was just proof that she knew she'd done wrong and was hoping to make YOU feel bad about it. You are NTA, but your mother is a piece of work.", "NTA. I would lose my shit, especially as an adult.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my parents left my sister and I overnight a couple times with this elderly couple that went to our church. The first time, the wife took all of our CLEAN clothes out of our bag and washed them when we weren\u2019t looking AND THEN tried to swipe my clothes when I was in the shower, but I had locked the door. She did manage to swipe my younger sister\u2019s clothes while she was showering, and replaced her pajamas with one of the husband\u2019s oversized shirts. \n\nI was maybe 10 or 12 and my sister is 5 years younger. I was so fucking unbelievably creeped out. The next time, I made sure my sister knew to lock the door every single time she was in the bathroom, and I had this little diary lock that I put on the zipper of our bag. I guess the wife got the message, because my parents certainly weren\u2019t going to call her out, even though they knew I was super uncomfortable with all of that.", "NTA and I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s cried victim after completely violating boundaries.", "NTA- I hope your sweater is okay.", "NTA- this sounda like it could ve my mothwr tbh. I am currently trying to ser more boundries. While the intention might have been good, the lack of reasoning and consent behinf it all is awful. She is also not regulating her own emotions and using guot tripping to save herself- I\u2018ve also been there. Explain to her why how it makes you feel what she did, tha u appreciatr the gesture, but in the future would not tomerate such behaviour and that you expect clear communication.\njust because she\u2018s ypur mother, does not meab she has un\u00f6imited access to your stuff.", "INFO\n\nDoes your mom always cry when she does wrong and gets confronted for it?", "INFO: does your mom have a history of sabotaging you like this?

You have every right to speak up. \n\nHer crying is emotionally manipulative, which is why you feel bad. The correct response on her part would be an apology and a promise to not do such things again, not to guilt you for feeling upset by her actions.", ">And she washed my cashmere sweater which I only dry clean.\n\nIs she going to pay for it now? I don't think that was a nice gesture. It doesn't matter if you don't pack well. NTA.", "NTA \nIt was a nice gesture, but \"a good thought doesn't mean it's good made\" (I don't know if there's a real English translation for it).\nSo, she destroyed your cashmere sweater with her gesture and she should've asked, because there could've been private stuff in your suitcase.\n\nI think she overreacted because she wanted to show you, that she loves you. But that doesn't make it better.", "**NTA**, your mother stomped all over barriers and screwed up your travel preperations.  If you don't mind aggravating the situation, as her why she ruined a dry-clean only cashmere sweater.  I would probably let this lie but, but I think your mother probably has other boundary issues.", "NTA. Your mom\u2019s heart was in the right place, but her brain was somewhere else. You were packed and ready to go - you had everything under control, and she made a decision of what to do with your clothes without asking you. You had every right to be irritated with her, especially since she didn\u2019t even tell you after the fact what she had done. \n\nHer crying and telling you to go to your father in pure emotional manipulation - she is punishing you for your legitimate feelings. You didn\u2019t ruin your last night together - she did. After all, when you approached her about your clothes, she could have apologized to you instead of playing the guilt card.", "NTA\n\nParents have boundaries too. You're no longer a child. She needs to ask before doing anything with your belongings.", "Ew people like your mom are the most annoying and manipulative. Definitely you\u2019re Nta. My mom was the same way but she was \u201csneaky\u201d about it and then played victim", "NTA - Regardless of anything else, your stuff was in your suitcase. That alone is an issue, right there. This is more than not understanding boundries, she emptied a suitcase to do this.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not helping if you didn't ask.  The 'gesture' was not 'nice.'", "NTA is that how she deals with adversity? So sorry", "NTA-she needs to know that's not ok...although she probably meant well.", "NTA\n\nP.S: As someone who owns multiple items in cashmere, they can be washed by hand or in the \u201cdelicates\u201d cycle in the washing machine. I promise you, they won\u2019t get damaged. You can put them in a mesh wash bag. I started doing this after a dry cleaning service ruined my cashmere jumper. Not defending your mother here. Just wanted to share this in case you need to get it dry-cleaned but don\u2019t have the time.\n\nETA: Added info about the wash bag.", "NTA, and you may want to check out some of the resources at /r/raisedbynarcissists. What your mother did stinks of manipulation.", "NTA- it's okay to have boundaries especially at 30. While I'm sure she thoight she was doing a nice thing it doesn't make it appropriate without you agreeing to it", "NTA,  It sounds like your mother has People Pleaser Syndrome, always trying to be helpful and make people happy, even when not requested or needed.  I think you did right to tell her you appreciate her wanting to \"help,\" but this is not the way.  You need to set your boundaries, and your personal items are just that.  You may go through this same conversation with her again, but eventually she should get the message.  My mother had PPS, we worked through it.", "NTA. I used to have a similar issue with my mother. We live in the same town so they have a key to my house for emergencies (and vice versa). However my mum used to take this as if I was away for any reason she could come into my house and \"help\" which always involved her breaking and/or losing something (mostly my window blinds). Despite me asking her multiple times not to come in while I was away she continued to do it until one time I was blatantly rude about what she had done at which made her stop because she was offended.\n\nSo sometimes the only way to get people to stop pushing your boundaries is to be incredibly rude when they do until they get the message.", "NTA. My mother went through my things from childhood to adulthood.

Way back in the way back, I was a single mom and had to travel on business about once a month, so I had a sitter stay at my place to watch my kiddo. One month my parents were in town and offered to stay for the week. Grateful as it saved me some $$. When I got home, my mom informed me she had done my laundry and was surprised that I had no underwear. I'm like, Mom, what do you think was in my suitcase with me? Oops ... So fast forward a couple of weeks and I get a package delivered to my office from my mom. My secretary was all excited and had me open it right away. Inside was a bunch of pretty lacy panties from VS. I called my mom to thank her, and she said, \"Well, you'll never catch a man in those plain white cotton things you wear.\" All I could say was, \"***What makes you think guys are looking at my underwear?!***\"\n\nEpic parenting fail, and a really funny memory!", ">*This is manipulation, pure and simple*.\n\nAbsolutely.  Your mother was throwing a silent tantrum, OP, because..... \n\n*On the night before I flew back, I went out with some friends*.\n\nI bet that you didn't ask permission to do this, OP, and perhaps you came in later than she wished.  You have offended her by growing up and no longer being under her control.\n\nNext time that you visit your hometown, OP, think about staying with one of your friends instead of mom.  There needs to be push back for such a serious breach of boundaries.\n\nNTA", "I will add, in all fairness, that I am unorganized and my version of packing after a trip is stuffing everything in the suitcase to be washed when I get home.", "Holy shit you're intense", "You think she does her own laundry if mom is doing it for her without asking?", "But either she put the sweater in the dryer (and ruined it), or she assumed a wool sweater would air-dry overnight and forced OP to pack a damp sweater at the last minute. But I hope you\u2019re right and she did no permanent damage.", "I don't think we have enough information to make this diagnosis. I appreciate you sharing so that people can learn and possibly see these traits in themselves or others. But I feel like this is a really big leap.\n\nIf it were my mother I would assume that she had gone through my suitcase. Tried on part of my clothes. Spilled wine and/or got food on my clothes that she was wearing at the time, realized this was going to be hard to gaslight me about. Put the clothes in the washing machine to have a way to gaslight me. So that would make OP's mother an abusive narcissist.  Although, this also could be true; we don't have enough information to determine.", "Did you even read this?  OP was packed to catch a flight the next day, mom unpacked belongings, which meant OP was no longer prepared with their packed belongings.  Seems pretty straightforward.", "That's as may be, it's still a frog.\n\nThat is to say, it does not matter if your method of packing does not meet your mothers standards. You were packing for you, to return to your home where you could unpack and wash at your leisure. Your standard is the only one that matters.\n\nYou were not packing for her or a mixture of her stuff and yours. You were packing your stuff. As long as it fit in the suitcase and you were satisfied with it, that is all that matters.\n\nShe needed to leave your stuff alone. If it being messily packed stresses her out, she needs to work on dealing with her feelings without touching your stuff.\n\nIf she was trying to \"make your life easier\", she failed. I can understand the impulse to it. But she failed. Objectively, she made things harder for you because she didn't even get things washed to start repacking, much less complete it.\n\nBut make no mistake. Even if she'd completed washing and repacking, she would have still been in the wrong. It was not her stuff and she had no business doing anything with it.\n\nSide note: Would I be right in guessing that if she were to visit you, she'd spend time reorganizing drawers/closets, or deep cleaning parts of your place that you'd already cleaned prior?", "Lol. Isn't that how everyone packs on the way home? All the laundry is dirty, so you just shove it in the suitcase \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af I do pair my socks, after having misplaced one of my favorite running socks.\n\nNTA. Mom overstepped a lot. All she needed to do was ask first. It's not hard.", "Given that OP had to catch a flight back home, one would very much assume she manages her own laundry as needed."]}
