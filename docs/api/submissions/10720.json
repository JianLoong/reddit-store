On the night before I flew back, I went out with some friends. I came home to find my suitcase empty. I mildly panicked because my flight was early the next morning. I asked my mom about it and she was washing the clothes. It was late, like close to midnight, and they were still drying. And she washed my cashmere sweater which I only dry clean. \n\nI was noticeably irritated. I kept asking where my stuff was and was getting anxious about not knowing if everything was accounted for. \n\nI felt bad after I calmed down. I told my mom that while the gesture was nice, I don\u2019t want her going through my things without asking. She started crying and told me to hang out with my dad since \u201cI never get mad at him\u201d. I feel like I ruined our last night together and that I should have just kept my mouth shut. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the feedback. Yes she has done things like this before, now that I reflect, I don\u2019t think she ever gave me a healthy amount of privacy. I moved out when I was 17 and I don\u2019t see her a lot, so it just felt really bad to make her cry, especially since doing a chore for someone could be seen as motherly.

Instead of making a direct request for that need to be filled, which many ppl w these tendencies might believe they don't deserve or can't do, she does something \"\"for\"\" op. Now that she's done something she believes merits approval and affection, she goes to op expecting that emotional reward as supposed payment for the unrequested service\n\nEvidence of this thinking: when op is instead upset about the invasiveness and disruption and property damage, listen to her reply. \"Why don't you go be with your father? You're never angry at him.\" Mom, like my father, sounds like she's living in a fantasy land in which checking off every task she can to earn the favor of ppl around her should guarantee her perfectly smooth relationships.

Possible that the father could have been absent or abusive in ways that caused op to hide any dissatisfaction, sure.

Ugh, years ago I had my boyfriend's mom unpack my bag to hang up my clothes for a one night stay at a family member's home. I was not pleased and it felt extremely nosy. It's okay to be annoyed about this even if her intentions were good.", "NTA\n\nMy mom went crazy too", "Info : why so many mom now are neurotic ? Because they are influenced by society. Many women are reminded that being a mother is the most beautiful thing in the world. So some women use that while being entitled, thus creating monsters of manipulation", "100% agree. If I have the option of doing laundry on long trips (visiting friends or family), I always *ask* if they mind if I use their laundry facilities, *do it myself,* and *take some burden off them* by asking if I can add other things of theirs to my load(s), which I always return to them washed, dried, and folded. \n\nThe only exception was my brother a SIL because they have one of those no-agitator top-load washing machines, and I couldn't reach the bottom of it to retrieve all the items in it to put them in the dryer. I have no idea who designed that machine, but they were at least 5'10! So for a few years, my brother (6'2) or SIL (5'11) had to grab the last few things out of the machine and toss them in the dryer. Their kids are getting older and have more chores now, so they finally have a stepstool to use it (my niece is 10 and only 2\" shorter than me!), so I was able to use it myself this year!\n\nEven before the stepstool, I did a call out \"bring anything that needs washed! Laundry is going in now!\" I could at least start the load!\n\nAnd no one went through my suitcase! I asked to put the contents in the washer, but no one touched it!", "Her mom\u2019s heart was not \u201cin the right place.\u201d Every single thing she did from going into OP\u2019s room to washing her clothes late at night and accusing OP of loving her father more was emotional manipulation.", "Mom was trying to make the op miss her flight and stay at her parents longer.", "Same place that spinach does when you cook it, I swear.", "House elves steal the excess to make socks, cause they only get 1 from each pair from the washing machine.", "My mum read my diary. Saw something she didn't like and so left it open so I'd know that she'd seen it. Then she played the victim.\n\nShe never apologised for the breach in privacy. I stopped writing in a diary (which in hindsight impacted my mental health) and I never trusted her the same way again.", "NAH \u2014 everyone in the comments can\u2019t be serious when saying that OPs mom is being manipulative.\n\nSome mothers don\u2019t let go and continue to treat their adult children as children. She probably genuinely thought she was being helpful and was hurt by the response.  I don\u2019t think she\u2019s inherently being manipulative. Manipulation requires some form of bad intent, which I think is missing from this situation. She just has issues with boundaries. My mother does as well. Doesn\u2019t make her an AH. It\u2019s probably just a mom thing.", "NTA... Mom wants to mommy and overstepped. Cashmere? C'mon. At least check the labels if you're going to do an un-asked, un-consented to \"favor\" for someone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd have empathy for mom but the emotional manipulation in lieu of proper acknowledgement and apology for overstepping boundaries? Not cool at all. Prolly wouldn't visit for a while. She knows why.", "My mil used to do our laundry right before we were supposed to leave. We finally got locks for our luggage", "Some mothers are narcissists. My mother would constantly do stuff like this with the hope she should sabotage my exit and force me to stay or to get me to do things she wanted me to do. This to me sounds like classic narcissism. Especially because no one leaves at 17 without really looking back unless there was something to leave from.", "Those were exactly my thoughts. Mom was trying to make op miss the flight. \nNTA op. And you felt bad for what you said because your mother intentionally guilt tripped you. Like I hear my mother... Yes I am same generation with you.", "When the pieces started coming together we sold our house and moved 1600 miles away from her. I think that might be freaking the fuck out?", "There's also a point to be made here about how good you are at packing if you are someone who travels a lot. I can do 6 days with a \"weekender\" shoulder bag! If someone unpacked my weekender that I took for a 6-day trip, it would take me a good chunk of time (at least an hour) to repack it. If I had already packed it to depart the next day, and the clothes I needed to put in it would be wet until 3 AM, I would then be up at 4 AM to re-do something I had already done!", "Once I asked to start doing only my own laundry, that\u2019s what happened. It was when I started buying my own clothes because then I could choose what I wanted. My mom has never taken. Only offered when I was like a senior in high school and working full time. She was sahm and would just text and ask if I wanted her to do my laundry. It was just her way of being nice when I was too busy", "I NEED to know the answer...WHERE ARE MY MATCHING SOCKS??!!", "My mom BROKE the lock on my diary and then would throw things back in my face during arguments.  She insisted I \"wanted\" her to read my diary.  \n\nLooking back, I don't know why I just didn't keep a diary, but you don't think about that when you're 12....  you also don't recognize how utterly inappropriate your mother is being until much later", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is old enough to know the basics of respect. Her crying and over dramatic reaction is just a way for her to get out of having to admit she was wrong and apologize.", "NTA", "Might as well open your mail. Oh wait, I bet she did, eh?\n\nWashing cashmere in water at her age isn't likely ignorance, but malicious.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Nice gestures without consent aren't nice gestures.", "NTA. My mother in law is constantly doing things that ruins things or makes my life harder and my husband always says, \u201cShe\u2019s just trying to help!\u201d Well\u2026 she is most definitely not helping. I agree with all the others, seeing as how you are a grown adult, she should have asked first.", "NTA.", "NTA", "It is unfortunate that your comment is being down voted, because you are not wrong.", "Yeah, I usually like to try and see everything from the other person's perspective as well, ask \"were they just being a bit daft in decision making\", but this screams ulterior motive to me. Firstly, we can reasonably assume the mother has been washing clothes for at least 20 years, so she knows approximately how long a load takes to wash and dry. We also can safely assume she knew the daughter was leaving the next day (though time of departure might be a mitigating factor, If she's leaving at 6pm it's a different story to 5am). I see a few much more reasonable explanations as to why the Mum did this than \"oh I was just trying to do something nice\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Snooped through the luggage, then panicked and needed a reason to explain why it was all messy/not in the right place. This is a clear invasion of privacy.\n* Empty nesting of some sort, trying to find any way to force the daughter to have to stay longer. Deliberately manipulative and something my mother would do when she didn't want me to leave the house for things she'd already approved of. Can stem from just wanting more time with your kid, or more sinister wanting control/not handling that you no longer control them\n* Depending on the age of the mother, it's not unreasonable to say she might be pushing 70, and it was just an honest to god seniors moment. This could either be supported or refuted by her response of \"go to your dad\". She could be upset that she's losing her faculties, or she could be pulling classic narc behaviour.", "I was about 14/15, and very close friends with a gal from another school, which was uncommon for someone at an all boys school. We spoke almost every night, just got along great. I decided for her birthday I'd write a lovely letter, and knew she liked colourful pens so would get her some of those (I had very little money). I drafted it on my phone since I had about a 1 hour public transport commute to/from school, and didn't want to write it in my schoolbooks. One night we're watching TV, I go to the kitchen or whatever, come back, and Mum's doing a sly grin. And then almost immediately starts asking me about it. I'm confused because the only place I'd put it was on my phone, which I now notice I'd left on the table in front of her. She starts pressuring me insisting I reveal everything, which I had already mentioned in passing, she knew about my friend. Insisting nobody says things like that if they're not in love or whatever. All I could focus on was \"This conversation makes me uncomfortable, and why the fuck did you go through my phone?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImmediate lack of trust from me, spent the time before I went NC giving her no information about my life, and got very good at hiding things.", "I\u2019m largely the same with the ungovernable crying. I was way more bothered by the childish \u201cgo hang out with your dad\u201d comment than the crying. OP is NTA.", "They are wedged in the crack between washer and dryer.
