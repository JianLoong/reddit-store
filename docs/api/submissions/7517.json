Why else would you need the RSVP?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you were very clear with your instructions. Don\u2019t let their own childish behavior make you feel like you are in the wrong. You are not.\n\nI hope your child had a wonderful birthday! \ud83d\udc99", "You're NTA. If they could not take 5 seconds to RSVP,  too bad for them.", "NTA, it's rude as hell not to RSVP (or worse, RSVP \"yes\" and no-show without any warning so the cost is lost).", "NTA. People just always trying to get something for free.", "NTA it\u2019s only fair that you pay for those who rsvpd. From the title I thought you hosted a party and made the guests pay and for that I would say yta but no you made it clear how it works.", "NTA. The RSVP - regardless of whether you were paying or not - is a common courtesy.\n\nThose same people also leave puppies on the side of a highway after their kids get tired of it.", "NTA, you booked according to the numbers given and they were asked multiple times to respond and ignored your requests.", "NTA.  They needed to learn the lesson of being considerate.", "NTA Who shows up to an event when they didn\u2019t RSVP? You offered to pay for everything if they just took a minute out of their day to do that one simple thing. You shouldn\u2019t blame yourself for any of it, they saw you were having it at a business and not in your backyard so of course they have to let you know who is coming. You were gracious enough to let them join and even split the cost with them, they were rude and left. Given how they acted I\u2019m assuming they didn\u2019t even bring a birthday present, because cheap inconsiderate people usually don\u2019t. Don\u2019t invite them to the next one, save yourself the headache!", "Was going to say yeah, definitely, by the title alone! But I actually read it and no, NTA. Although I have 5 kids, and have thrown SO many parties, so word of advice, always reserve 5 extra. 1st five who show, you're covered. After that, it's up to you if you want to pay or not. (I would, but I'm a damn pushover with family...)", "NTA you let them know they had to rsvp by a certain date. You even went above and beyond by offering to do half. They seem to think they are entitled and can do as these please.", "NTA. Seems like they don\u2019t understand the concept of RSVP.", "NTA \n\nThey were the rude ones to show up without letting you know.  Even if you didn\u2019t reach out to make sure\u2026..it\u2019s normal social etiquette that if someone wants you to RSVP then you RSVP. Not responding to a request for RSVP typically means not going. You are in the clear.\n\nThough I\u2019m passive aggressive too, and depending on if it continues then wait for the next time it gets brought up.  \u201cI know I\u2019m sorry for the confusion.  It\u2019s just when you didn\u2019t RSVP like I requested on the invite, didn\u2019t return my phone calls, or email I just thought you were saying you weren\u2019t coming and didn\u2019t know how to tell me.  It\u2019s like I said in my phone call I needed to know the exact headcount in order to budget exactly how much it would cost.  I\u2019m sure you understand that with ___ amount of people coming unexpectedly it would be challenging to pay.  Especially when you didn\u2019t respond to any (inflection) attempts that you wouldn\u2019t be here.  But this is good so next time I write an invite for an RSVP, I\u2019ll put down that if people unexpectedly can come great but that it would be on them to pay.\u201d \n\nSay it with the sweetest tone and apologetic face\u2026..they can\u2019t really respond since they were the ones in the wrong.", "NTA. Good grief, grace is quickly becoming extinct. What rude, entitled, self-centered people. I would've totally forked out the money so my kid could celebrate the birthday child. But beyond that, I would've frickin' RSVP'd. Sheesh.", "Nta. You planned ahead of time giving them multiple notices", "NTA. How hard is it for people to reply?", "NTA \nYou were actually nicer than me, because I wouldn\u2019t have offered to pay half at all. And you should reply to these comments on social media", "Nope,  NTA.  You clearly laid it out in your invite that you needed RSVP so you would know how much to pay.  You assumed, rightfully so, that the headcount was reached and paid accordingly.  Anyone showing up the day of should have assumed they were paying their own way in if they failed to RSVP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If my kid is invited to a party like this you bet I\u2019m going to rsvp. When I was a kid I would get invited to Chuck E. Cheese but would have to pay for games. It\u2019s  nice that you were paying and only asked for the rsvp.", "Nta\n\nNot your fault the fools couldn\u2019t let you know they were coming. They had at least 2 months and you were asking.

Yeah, I didn't think so.", "NTA\n\nI think you were more than generous offering to pay half, tbh. Funny how they can attack you on social media but not send a message saying, yeah, we'll come, sign us up.", "NTA.  They didn't follow instructions so that cost them money and frustration.  Maybe next time they receive a request to RSVP they will do just that.  As for catching crap on social media, block them.  No one gets to spend your money or tell you how to.  You were making a point and I bet they will remember next time.", "[deleted]", "I was actually typing out a request for more info before deciding that OP was NTA regardless, but some places might be a flat fee and you need the RSVP just for headcount/seating purposes (like the baby shower I'm planning).", "They did thank you!", "Yes exactly NTA is a simple RSVP too much too ask", "When I graduated HS, a friend of mine's mom threw a party.

This is such a headache and it hurts to be blasted for something I did my due diligence on ya know?", "I had it listed on the invites so it was clear why I needed it but I guess I should assume next time people don\u2019t read although if you ignore me and leave me on read every time I reach out idk I just won\u2019t invite them for the future most likely!", "I want to but I also don\u2019t want to give them the satisfaction on there of the drama and whatnot. I\u2019m leaning towards just blocking them and no longer inviting them. They\u2019ve done this before but showed up with strangers as well.

Thank you for your response", "So I can understand that to an extent but the invites also had it listed there and I made it very clear that I needed the headcount and why so I just did the down payment for set amount of people. I\u2019m moreso just wondering if I should\u2019ve caved in the moment instead of offering to pay half. I made the down payment a month before the party and reached out again to make sure and got no response, I don\u2019t feel like that part is my fault.", "Offering to pay for the people who didn't bother to respond is just encouraging bad behavior. OP didn't say they couldn't participate --just that they'd have to cover their own fees, which is completely fair.", "Cool story...", "Damn.  No RSVP and no GIFT = No CLASS", "Okay, that might be where the issue lies. \n\nAlways assume, everyone is an idiot, lol. Even if you KNOW they aren't assume they will have and idiotic moment. \n\nIt will save you a lot of headaches in the future.\n\nBy putting that on the invite, it could be (and will be...because people are idiots) taken as, \"RSVP, only if you want a goodie bag for your kid, otherwise just show up\".", "I quit with those folks around the 5th birthday. Best do it before the birthday activities get pricier.

Depending if you are feeling petty, just anytime they start it then remind them they did that BS and so you thought they couldn\u2019t figure out a way to say no.  Like they can shoot the first shot but yeah keep going \u201cwell it was on my invite\u2026.and text\u2026..and etc.\u201d lol Or next invite have that part about consequences of not rsvp in bold, italics, higher font to really get the point across.  Maybe even have it highlighted to be sure hahaha. You can tell other friends and family what happened in case anyone gets uppidity about it. I\u2019m petty though. \n\nAre they just saying petty things to you or around family and friends too?", "[deleted]", "I liked it", "Oh no, I didn't think of that! You're right. There's a flaw in my logic. Lol", "Lol that\u2019s funny! I should.. and it\u2019s on social media for everyone to see and some family is backing it up.. I feel I did my due diligence and they think that I should\u2019ve assumed regardless of an answer.. just leaning towards blocking them and never inviting them again lol", "I\u2019m just gonna put a disclaimer next time if you don\u2019t rsvp you can\u2019t come at all regardless \ud83e\udd23 I am a little biased about these family members as in the past they would RSVP and then show up with strangers like it was fine and dandy so I think I\u2019ve been too much of a pushover. I appreciate your insight!", "You TOTALLY did your due diligence and beyond.", "No. You asked for a head count for a reason. Nta, not your fault they just expected you to have a blank expense account for it.", "They had every chance to reply. They didn't. You paid for those who did. NTA.", "NTA but personally I always plan for a few extra, so I either add more kids on or just keep it in the back of my head for budgeting purposes", "Definitely NTA, and I love how social media always seems to be used as a tool for people to tell a story where they're painted as a victim.", "NTA you put RSVP on a card for that specific reason.", "NTA but seriously 2-3 months in advance? Was this a destination birthday party lol", "NTA, you did it the only sane way! They need to foot the bill if they're so rude that they can't RSVP!", "Nta", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "I can understand that", "Lol no I just like to have my ducks in a row especially with peoples work schedules or kids schedules, I just like to have it far in advance. Especially since a lot of people had to come from 5-6 hours away", "Since OP said it was a kid's event space I assume it was one of those play/gym sort of things or something similar. Those places often hold birthday parties where they're also still open for the public. \n\nBooking a birthday gets you a reserved space and maybe some snacks, drinks, cake, etc. You still have to pay per kid like you normally would, but you usually get a decent discount per kid since you're also paying for the extras. \n\nThat's probably why she was only willing to pay for half the total for the kids she didn't expect since that's what it would've originally cost her if they had RSVP'd.", "I hate people who take their beefs to social media, especially if they're at fault. Maybe reply to those posts with a screenshot of the invitation and your reminders, and a comment that \"reading is obviously a challenge\"."]}
