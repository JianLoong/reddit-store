I guess the only thing that might have made it less dramatic would have been to have to let the group know later that your family couldn't make it due to other plans. That said, the group made pretty significant plans without asking you about it, so they kind of deserved to have their balloon popped. I understand that would have been a frustrating moment and being emotional and frank about it was justified. I hope you stick to the plans you have already made. It is your time, use it how you choose.", "NTA, it sounds like manipulation on their part. Stick to your plans. Take the vacation you want to take.", "NTA...you only get so much time off.  Use it as you choose.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to go on a forced \u201cvacation\u201d with your family doing stuff that you hate doing. Sister is acting like she\u2019s doing you a big favor and it\u2019s disingenuous bullshit. I opted out of my family\u2019s dysfunctional nightmares and it was the best decision ever.", "NTA- They didn\u2019t talk to you about it before, AND it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s birthday. And how you choose to vacation is your decision.", "NTA. You can\u2019t just make plans for people without asking for their input. Everyone has jobs and plans of their own. That\u2019s not the type of thing you surprise an adult with, it just doesn\u2019t work. Enjoy the trip for your daughter\u2019s birthday!", "NTA. They showed no consideration for you, your husband or your daughter.", "NTA- if somebody plans my vacation for me and without me, I\u2019m not going to smile and pretend I\u2019m excited. My time off is important and my autonomy is even more important.", "NTA. Surprises are great for little things - not for big things like vacations. You already had plans for your daughter\u2019s birthday. This was the risk they took making plans without your input. And then saying you hurt their feeling is them trying to put the responsibility for their bad planning on you. \n\nYour sister said you didn\u2019t respect her schedule, but did she respect yours?", "NTA\n\nAnd those \u2018vacations\u2019 sound like hell anyway.", "ETA\n\nWhat you said was really passive aggressive. It sounds like you don\u2019t want to go there so you can just say something more polite like: we\u2019ve already made plans to go elsewhere, or we\u2019re hoping to do international travel etc\n\n\nThe fam could\u2019ve planned with you but honestly it\u2019s usually easiest to just pick a date between a few people rather than go back and forth with a lot of people", "ESH.\n\nSurprise vacations are like surprise puppies: almost never a good idea. If they wanted to treat your family or your daughter they did need to get your input. Only an AH control freak surprises someone else with a \"gift\" thst requires a ton of effort, time or expense.\n\nHowever, snarkily guilt tripping them with \"I hope you enjoy celebrating my daughter's birthday without us\" was out of line. The rest of your family's social life doesn't revolve around your kid's birthday, and if you've been traveling instead there's no expectation that they would. All you had to say was that it was your daughter's birthday so you'd already made travel plans, so you'd have to sit this out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This was basically them telling you what you would do whether you like it or not. Good for you and enjoy your trip.", "Absolutely NTA. Why in the world would they make plans for your daughter's birthday without making sure you were available? While your response wasn't kind, I don't think it raises to the level of asshole. Spend your daughter's birthday how she wants.", "Definitely NTA. It's up to you and your family to decide where you will go on vacation.", "NTA it sounds like they did you a favor. You have plans so you can\u2019t go. Just keep taking you little family vacations and relax. I would hate \u201cvacationing\u201d with my family", "I missed the part where they invited you.

Did your siblings think this would be a birthday surprise for your daughter or did they forget or\u2026 ?", "I would personally have smiled and asked whether they would be paying for me via bank transfer, or simply loaning me their credit card - but then, I'm petty.

In my family their name is carol and they\u2019d never learn how to people if you didn\u2019t call them out", "NTA.  They planned a vacation and expected you to rearrange your life to fit it in?  Anyone who is upset that you will not be there is the AH.  Your family wants to vacation in different places as  a smaller family unit.  Not the AH at all.", "NTA.", "NTA", "They were bothered about your family group not vacationing at Sis\u2019s house.  The \u201csurprise\u201d was an attempt to corner you into participating.", "YTA. She hates parties and to take her on birthday trips. So if course they didn't take her birthday into account - you're never there to celebrate with \n\nAnd for the rest of the post, it seems perfectly reasonable to give up trying to plan with you, so they're planning without you. This seems to be a result you should be happy with.\n\nYou're a dog in manger.", "NTA. You don't want to go on your sister's vacation. No problem there. If your siblings want to bow down to HRH for a vacation house that's okay.\n\nIt was rude of them to assume you would also be a grateful peasant.\n\nEnjoy your vacation and birthday celebration. They probably won't try that again.", "Hello no. Highly support you not doing this\u2026 \n\nNTA", "NTA Vacation time is limited and everyone can choose themselves how to spend it.

It's her daughter and since the daughter doesn't like parties they really should've asked her what she was doing for her. I wouldn't want to vacation with anyone if I have to do what u want and eat what u want. Let's not talk about cooking and cleaning. To me vacations are to relax and enjoy urself", "ESH\nYou didn't need to make it about missing your daughter's birthday. You wouldn't be one of the a-holes if you said \"We have other plans\" without dragging your kid into it. If they picked the dates intentionally to coincide with your routine of taking a trip on her birthday, assuming that time was theirs to use, you weren't an a-hole at all. \n\nYou want something different from a vacation than what your family does at your sister's house. It's okay to set boundaries to protect your safety and comfort. Joining fewer family trips, joining only when others on the trip are also not working, joining for a shorter period, all are options that could balance your needs with participating in large vacation get togethers.", "YTA. I had to reread this a few times to get what happened.  You said that schedules rarely align for you to hang/vacation/whatever at your sister's house with the family.  They, knowing you have free time at your daughter's birthday, work together so they can hang out with you and celebrate your daughter too (because maybe they want to spend some time with their niece?).  Your response is a snarky comment, basically trashing their attempt to get everyone together for once.\n\nEven if you already had unchangeable plans, dismissing them like that is just rude.  Sure, you do you blah blah blah, but just be honest and tell them what you really think (that spending time with them sucks and isn't worth ever compromising about to make happen).  Then no one has to waste time considering you again, and you don't have to think about it again.", "NTA. People need to learn the difference between a good surprise and a surprise that creates an imposition.", "Not respecting her schedule? Lol that's rich. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nWhy would they not include you? That makes no sense", "They picked the date knowing OP would be available for their trip.", "I was just wondering if this was done on purpose. Perhaps OP\u2019s family does not enjoy vacationing with them.", "OP should be happy that their family planned a vacation for them (including OP & their kids) without informing or letting them know before it was thrust on them. The family is the AH, not OP. The family is trying to manipulate OP into doing what they want them to do.", "Then they shouldn't get upset when the people they left out of the planning don't go along with it.", "Since they deliberately chose to plan their 'surprise vacation over OP's daughter's birthday - her comment was warranted. You don't make plans for someone else's kids birthday, particularly a whole vacation and then get upset when they don't agree to it.", "The family intentionally picked that time as they knew OP would be available for a vacation. They picked the dates that ran over OP's daughters birthday on purpose.", "Telling them that spending time with them sucks is more rude than what OP said? How?", "Or maybe knowing they had other plans?", "It sounds like they are bothered by her reaction and comments and not just the fact they can\u2019t go"]}
