NTA.", "I keep reading and reading and the only conclusion I come to is that they purposely chose those days knowing that OP wouldn't come.", "Because it's NOT a vacation for OP *or* daughter.\n\nRelatives SUCK, and have no privilege to demand even a SECOND of OP's time.", "HI SISTER THAT OWNS THE VACATION HOUSE!!!!!!", "I totally agree. It sounds like the family tried to include OP in tons of plans, and OP wasn\u2019t satisfied with any of them. So the family gave up and decided to make their own plans without OP.", "Sooooo, you're saying the only time they can ever spend time \u231a with their niece is by blindsiding  her parents with a done deal? Are you OP's mom?", "OP doesn't want to, and made it plain with behavior.\n\nNo need to be openly rude to relatives' faces when behavior can imply the answer to an I telligent and reasonable person.", "Completely agree! I feel bad for the siblings who put in so much effort to try to find a time to all spend together. All this could have been avoided by OP just being clear with their siblings and saying they don\u2019t plan on attending, instead of dragging it out and making it seem like a scheduling issue when clearly they just don\u2019t want to go. \n\n\nOP should just be honest with them, say they don\u2019t plan on joining for future family trips and would rather plan vacations elsewhere with their daughter and husband. That way the rest of the family can be free to plan their trips together without worrying about including them.", "That's what OP did.\n\nJust also letting relatives know OP is on to their little game.", "Disagree.\n\nRelatives could easily infer that OP has NO interest in the 'vacation's, they just don't like it & refuse to accept it.\n\nOP's statement is a way of acknowledging that and dismissing the relatives' petulence as unimportant.", "Read for comprehension, dearie.", "My advice to you is to leave before they show up. Less chance of you being manipulated to stay and have the party that way. Unless your SIL has a key to your house. In that case I think you're doomed.", "Do it. \nDo it for your mental, emotional and spiritual well being.\nConsider not being there at all, but at a spa instead? \nLet them come hoping to eat cake, but be somewhere else being pampered.\n\n\nOh and OP, NTA.\nCommunication is key in all relationships and your family had the audacity to not include you in some very specific plans about your immediate family and your child\u2019s birthday.\n\n\nGo and enjoy the vacation with your family, best wishes to your daughter on her birthday.\n\nHopefully your extended family will learn from their faux pas.", "Yea\u2026 which to most people would be a courteous gesture to make.\n\nIf OP has a problem with how these \u201cfamily vacations\u201d are done, she should be an adult and talk to her family about it. If she doesn\u2019t want to go, she can politely decline.\n\nThese trips read as awkward but she reads as bitter.", "I read the paragraph now twice and I can't find anything that answers the question.\n\nCould it be take you mistake reading comprehension with making wild assumptions?\n\nIt doesn't say that it was supposed to be a surprise for OP, I read it as a surprise for the parents (read the first line of the paragrpah above). OP says in said paragraph, that she should have been included in the planning. Why would she say that, if the surprise was for her?", "They tried to plan with OP. For neutral reasons it failed. They've managed a time that works for most, because they can't manage a time that works for all.\n\nOP doesn't seem to want to go anyway, but it's now upset they can't...", "I can't help but read this as OP's siblings saying \"We're meeting on this day. We know you're not coming because you have plans. Meh.. can't be helped, you'll be missed\"", "Yes thank you. OP says that as a family they actually don\u2019t like joining and they haven\u2019t participated in a few years. And apparently it\u2019s already known that they take time off for their daughter\u2019s birthday to travel, so to me it feels like everyone else agreed on a date that worked for them knowing that OP wouldn\u2019t want to join anyway. No idea why OP was insulted for not being included when she actually doesn\u2019t want to be included? And if she does and daughter is happy to join the rest of the family, they are welcome to?", "I think you misunderstood the post. I had to read it twice to keep up. \n\nOP and husband always take time off for their daughter's birthday for a trip. \n\nOP and husband have been unable to make it to any recent family vacations because they have limited time off and it never lines up. They're secretly ok with it because they don't enjoy those family vacations under the current circumstances at sister's house.\n\nOP's family decided to secretly all plan a family vacation at sister's house to coincide with OP's daughter's birthday, thinking it meant OP, husband and daughter would therefore finally be able to join.\n\nWhen this was presented to OP, they responded by saying they already have plans and won't be going. \n\nFamily is mad because they feel like they went out of their way to accommodate OP. \n\nOP is mad because they weren't consulted before their family planned all this. \n\nSo family is TA for trying to make it a surprise instead of just telling OP they're happy to all plan around her family's schedule. \n\nOP is also TA for not communicating all these years that they're not interested in these family vacations and instead blaming it on their schedule. \n\nThe resolution should be for OP to be honest about why they don't like those trips and express clearly if they are asking for the family to plan a different type of trip or if they just want to not participate.", "OP isn't upset that OP isn't going, they don't want to. Their siblings are the ones that are upset.", "OP is insulted that her family tried to plan a vacation for her daughters birthday without talking to her because they knew she would take time off during that time. \n\nI read this as her family tried to ambush her into going on this vacation annually with them again."]}
