Why make them \"infer\" it? That was a waste of their time. It sounds like they held off on making plans together as a result, even though they were all free, because she led to them believe she wanted to join in too.\n\n2) Maybe they *did* infer this, and that's why they stopped consulting her, made plans on their own (for a time they potientally already knew she wouldn't be available), and then announced what they were doing rather than asking. They may have been leaving the door open for her, but not necessarily expecting anything or trying to pressure her the way she assumed.\n\n3) The parents are the ones who said she \"ruined the surprise\", not the siblings, and the parents don't seem to have been involved in the planning either, so I don't think they necessarily speak for the group or know the full background. It's also not clear if the parents were upset she didn't want to go on the trip, or just at the rude comment she made in response.\n\nI feel like this is a situation where if you asked each person to describe the events, they'd all come back with a completely different version.

(Was the daughter even present for the \"surprise\"?) They also didn't explicitly invite OP, just announced their plans and she seemingly responded to that announcement as if they were *definitely* expecting her to go along.\n\nThe parents then confronted her about it afterwards, but OP doesn't mention the *siblings* doing the same.\n\nAnd were the parents upset about her not going, or just criticizing how she reacted? (I mean, it was definitely very passive aggressive in a way that I could see bringing down the mood.)\n\nOP also doesn't mention the siblings using the term \"surprise\", just the parents. So did the siblings refer to it as a surprise for her? Did the parents draw their own conclusion based on OP not knowing about it and/or her response? Was it possibly a surprise for the parents themselves, which is why they announced it in front of them? Lots of unknowns.\n\nOverall, the post puts a ton of emphasis on OP's emotions towards the vacation and why she feels pressured to go, but then only provides very vague details about what her siblings supposedly said and did to put that pressure on her. It makes me wonder if she just got caught up in her own head here (which we're all guilty of sometimes), filled in the blanks with her own anxieties, and misinterpreted their intentions without even realizing it. This could be one huge miscommunication, fueled by all the poor communication leading up to it.\n\nTL;DR I definitely agree with you that everyone involved needs to do a better job of communicating directly. It sounds like this story is full of assumptions being made on ALL sides and that's a recipe for resentment. They need to actually talk to each other and sort it out.", "That's why I think this is deliberate.\n\nWe know you don't want to come but we also don't want to risk offending you by not inviting you, so we planned this on the days we know you usually have plans.", "Same here.

The only time they take off is for daughter\u2019s birthday, so we\u2019ll schedule the family trip for them so she / they can join us, we\u2019ll surprise her at dinner and it\u2019ll be great!\u201d, without ever thinking a) that you might have already made other plans, or b) it\u2019s daughter\u2019s birthday, she gets to choose, or c) you just don\u2019t want to do someone else\u2019s housework while you\u2019re on vacation. \n\n\nAnd this is why so many people hate \u2018big\u2019 surprises: if the recipient doesn\u2019t react as positively as the giver has built it up in their head, then the *recipient* is suddenly the ungrateful bad guy.

That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with my comment lol.

Once you grow up and move out of home, what you do with your vacation is up to you. If you want to spend it with family - fine. If not - also fine.

They knew you have plans every year for her birthday, and they couldn't be bothered to include you in their planning  ON your daughter's birthday? It sounds very presumptuous of them.\n\nNow, at the end of the day, I would've asked the daughter which she preferred, but at the end of the day, it's ridiculous to cause a scene on their part because they couldn't be bothered to coordinate.", "NTA. I\u2019m with you. Vacationing with family is more like work. I want my on space to do what I want when I want. Go enjoy your planned vacation. They will get over it.", "Why is everything about your sister.", "NTA and you are my hero. I can only wish to have such a perfect reply in a situation like that.", "Soft YTA, you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it as well. You said you don\u2019t like the \u201cfamily\u201d vacation because it doesn\u2019t feel like a vacation so why fuss about them going on your kids birthday when you wouldn\u2019t go anyway. They prefer to go to your sisters probably because it saves them a lot of money. Maybe you should talk to your sister about letting others choose what to do and where to eat.", "NTA. My family does this to me too and I hate it. If you make the plans without me, they\u2019re your plans. If you invite me, you\u2019re inviting me to YOUR plans.

It\u2019s hard enough keeping track of your own schedule, let alone everyone else\u2019s, and it sounds like your daughters birthday tradition is for just your immediate family, not the whole extended family, so whilst they would be aware of it, it could easily have slipped everyone\u2019s minds when planning occurred. \n\nHowever, you\u2019ve already missed a few extended family vacations because of your busy schedule - and their response to this was to simply plan a trip around their schedules and act like they\u2019re doing you some massive favour by making it a surprise vacation for you, instead of actually getting to the root of the problem.", "Have you ever tried being honest with people? \nThey hate it.\nStating they don't enjoy these trips will get OP the same reaction as slapping them with a dead fish. \nTrust me, I tried it once people can not handle the truth.", "They planned kt so OP would be forced to go with them not to exclude her.

That's fine but she should be an adult enough to communicate that to her sister.  \n\nAlso, a lot of jealousy  about the sister's financial  situation.

If so OP gets free vacation where they don't  pay for lodging or food.", "Bud lol that\u2019s 100% dramatic don\u2019t even.   It was passive aggressive and dramatic.  That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s wrong but let\u2019s cal it what it is.", "I'm assuming that they thought it was a nice surprise for your benefit.  None of this makes you TA but you now have the unenviable task of dealing with their hurt feelings.  To keep the peace, I'd be tempted to apologize for being abrupt, shrug it off as being surprised and then tell them that you already had plans that your daughter is excited about and that you really can't change them.  If course if they were just trying to power play you, then I'd just tell them to piss up a rope and stand by what you said.", "I can understand the logic but that\u2019s still a lot of assumptions tbh. If Op has never spent their daughter\u2019s birthday with her family because the daughter choses and does something else, and does not go on any family trips because her husband can\u2019t come (I\u2019ll be honest that\u2019s more an excuse- an adult can attend at least one or two family trips without a spouse) why would they assume this would be the time they could trick her into coming? She\u2019d simply say no she\u2019s not coming just like she LITERALLY did. If they did remember Op and hubby always take a trip for her daughters birthday- they could have hoped that maybe they\u2019d choose to join. However that alone is still not manipulation or control. \n\nThere\u2019s a Hanlon\u2019s Razor saying that goes \u201cdo not attribute malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.\u201d To phrase it simply, there is no reason to assume her siblings cared so much to attempt to \u201cmanipulate and control Op\u201d if they elected to plan without her in the first place. They could have forgotten about their niece\u2019s birthday and that could explain the shocked response to Op\u2019s reaction \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "Apart from accidentally inverting of the holiday drama actors and actions, I stand by what I said. \n\nAlso, if I had to go in holiday with my entire family I would end up in jail and I absolutely wouldn\u2019t expect my family to change their holiday plans or cancel them because my child was celebrating a birthday! I am not the main actor and neither my child - a gift and card would be gratefully received.", "Yes I agree with everything you are saying and I was honestly very confused at first at what the issue even was. If I don\u2019t want to do a family thing I straight up say it. I imagine that the siblings have asked her why she doesn\u2019t come and she uses husbands job as an excuse and she might just be pissed off that now she has to choose and can\u2019t make an excuse as easily. They could have done it purposefully or maybe they didn\u2019t. I think there is a lot of history and context that we don\u2019t get and I can\u2019t remember if it was in the post or a comment, but OP def said something about sister being entitled so I think there is a lot of resentment and likely immaturity going on. Some posts on here I really wonder if people deep down know they are the AH, but they come on here and omit some facts so they feel better about themselves", "Yes it does because it\u2019s exactly what you said.  \u201cSimply stated what is/was going to happen\u201d.  Being dramatic doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong, but it\u2019s definitely a dramatic way to go about it.

This \"gift\" they're trying to foist on you is like getting someone a surprise pet that they'll be responsible for - a messy, irresponsible, terrible \"gift\" that's actually a surprise obligation. Nope nope nope nope nope. They planned this all without consulting you because they wanted you to feel guilty and say yes. That's super manipulative.\n\nHave fun with your daughter!

You're way too enmeshed with your family.  Spread your wings and enjoy your little family.  Aim for every 3-5 years doing the family vacay, if you insist.", "Asshole for the jaw dropping family dinner proclamation, not an asshole for not wanting to go.

There\u2019s no need to stoop to your family\u2019s level. You could have said \u201chey that sounds like fun but we have plans that week. Too bad about that.\u201d And then change the subject\u2014fast. ;)", "You are NTA but you are in an untenable situation.\n\nIf I were your siblings, I'd come back pretty quickly with \"then let's NAIL THIS DOWN for next year.\"  You don't want that.  You need to slyly explain that you aren't coming to any more family vacation trips.  You love them all, and this family vacation isn't for you.  Your daughter doesn't like large groups, your family is more relaxed when you're able to focus on your nuclear unit, and your husband's job change simply means that those vacation days are very precious to you.  You're happy to go to family dinners, maybe holidays.  But you will not be going to the family vacations for the foreseeable future.\n\nWill they be up in their feels about this?  YES.  What a shame, but not your problem.  They will try to make it your problem, but it isn't your problem.\n\nThere are some tricks to this.  First, do not get caught up in why you don't like family vacations.  Don't criticize golden sister or talk about being the maid at their house or never getting to do what you want to do there.  It's not even relevant.  You aren't saying \"no\" to big family vacations so much as you are saying \"yes\" to nuclear family vacations.  Talk about this season of your life and how you're enjoying travel and your husband is so busy that you really need that time to reconnect, blah blah blah.  It's not about them at all. \n\nSecond, when they talk about how awful it is, agree.  When they talk about feeling hurt, tell them you are so sorry that they feel that way.  Commiserate.  Yes, it's terrible that you really need this time to connect with your husband and daughter and just focus on each other, but them's the breaks--you have to do what your family has decided that it needs.  It's awful that you can't do both this and have the big family vacation but you'll all get through it.  And if they get really dramatic, laugh.  \"You're being awfully dramatic.  Obviously I'm not cutting off the family given that I'm here at dinner/lunch/Christmas/whatever.\"\n\nIf you completely avoid anything about how much you don't want to do this family vacation \\*and\\* you sympathize with their fee-fees about your not coming while staying firm that it's not what's best for your husband and daughter, that doesn't leave them a lot of room to scheme.  But either way, NTA.", "And the 'surprise' for the parents is \"oh the whole familys going even OP/their clan\" and so it makes them feel pressured to now attend because their parents are reacting to the whole family together", "Lmao. Didn\u2019t make it dramatic AT ALL??? The description of the dinner read like a movie script. If not for dramatic effect, why tell us \u201cI put my fork down and smiled.\u201d?", ">Unfortunately, we've already made plans for those dates and won't be able to make it\",\n\nExcept if they haven't figured out they aren't available that date every year then honestly it's on them", "I\u2019d not think it was dramatic at all.

Op NTA", "Yeah I'm kind of confused about why OP is upset that they planned a vacation without her, a vacation that she doesn't like going on and hasn't been on in years. Has OP just been telling them this whole time that she's been busy so she couldn't go? If so, they probably thought that they had happily worked out a way OP could join them.", "To an extent, I see your point of view but also if you have people who regularly manipulate you, as OP has explained their family does, then this is pretty textbook manipulation. Also yes adults can go on trips alone but considering how very little vacation most of us get (and how much vacation itself costs), it'd be kind of rude and selfish of OP to leave her husband behind on what may be the only vacation of the year AND take his kid(s) to boot.

Making major plans without consulting with others is just idiotic, even if people are normally available why would you just assume?", "going on regular vacations with your childhood family has always struck me as weird as hell. but also, def nta anyhow as you do in fact have plans already and they were rude to make plans without your input.", "How can they plan a \u2018surprise\u2019 for your child without including you in the planning?  It makes no sense. Good for you on calling them out. I\u2019ve said this before in other posts but I really don\u2019t get the whole family vacation thing. It seems like an American thing where you are obligated to spend your precious vacation time with family. I think you guys only get two weeks off a year, so it\u2019s even more precious.
