Your reasoning is inconsistent and circumstantial at best.\n\nYou say you \"help each other often.\" To what degree? Why is this scenario different to you?\n\nAdditionally, you say that it wasn't her fault because the window was very old and bound to break anyway. So, even though you both occupy this space, she must pay the full cost to fix it because the bad luck happened to her?\n\nIf what she had done was negligent, I would have a different opinion.", "ESH solely because of the stupidity of this entire situation. Why are *you* putting *half* of *your* paycheck into saving for a house, and she isn't doing her part? How is it a \"shared responsibility\" if she's not fulfilling her side of that responsibility? If she's not contributing to the housing fund, for the future house you will *share*, she has no right to ask you to pay for half a window, regardless of whether she broke it by accident or not. \n\nBefore you even consider buying a house, maybe you two need to sit down and have a real conversation about finances because what the heck is the logic here. Here's a start- take a quarter of your paycheck and a quarter of her's to put into the housing fund. Done. Now she's \"practicing saving,\" and you're still putting the same amount in the fund without depleting half of your own paycheck.\n\nETA: To all those saying Y-T-A, did you miss the part where she contributes basically *nothing* to the house savings? The finances are clearly way off-balance in the relationship, and I wouldn't doubt she doesn't help much with other expenses based on her attitude/behavior. If she's not contributing, she doesn't get to demand that OP pay half of anything, while claiming it's \"shared responsibility\" when clearly she doesn't take on any of that responsibility in the first place.", "Risk our future? It's a window.\n\nThe hyperbole alone gets you a YTA.", "YTA and shouldn't be married to someone if you can't fathom having any sort of combined income. She's absolutely correct here. You guys are a team. You both should be putting money into things that happen within your living space. That you both share. Because you are literally married to her.   \n\n\nPersonally, I can't imagine being married to someone who doesn't combine their income with mine. Otherwise what's the point? Income is a huge deal in relationships. Especially relationships bound by a legal document ffs lol. It's one thing to have a personal savings for fun stuff for either of you, but ideally you both should be combining MOST finances together, within a joint account. Because you aren't roommates. You are MARRIED!", "YTA the cost of repairing a window won't put in danger your future, but your attitude towards your wife is. If you always put on her shoulders the cost of maintaining the house, she won't be able to save money and your acting more like petty roommate than husband.", "Of course an unintended expense is a shared responsibility.  Don't argue, be a team player.  She's asking for half! Not unreasonable.", "YTA. How is paying for half of the cost of the window replacement gonna put your future at risk? How little do you really have in savings that a small emergency payment is putting your future together at risk? I mean this kind of mentality is putting your future together at risk but that's beside the point. \n\nAlso, how does one practice saving without saving? That phrase makes no sense to me.", "Why is only your money going towards a house?   Is she going to be on the title?    If the breakage was not her fault, why aren\u2019t you sharing the cost of window?  How do you pay for other stuff that is shared, eg buying appliances, is that 50/50?  Is here any flexibility with your finances?", "I can't see why you don't pay half the cost of an **accident** in your home.

You're either putting money aside as savings or you aren't. How exactly is she \"practicing\" savings??", "OK you have the money because you save it while she doesn't! You intend to buy a house : if she has no money don't put her name on the deed!! Now for the window I suggest you pay but ask her to reimburse as it comes from your savings. Maybe it will teach her that saving is not a luxury but a necessity", "You guys chose to have split finances, which living situation wise means that you're responsible only for your half of the bills. If my roommate broke something in the apartment, she'd be paying for it, not me. Same thing applies here, NTA.\n\nAnd as a side note OP, don't listen to the judgments on here. This sub has a massive holier than thou attitude about everything and posters here want to act like the supreme moral authority and like they're the voice of ethical standards but then I get heavily downvoted for pointing out that buying cocaine contributes to an entreprise which causes the deaths of thousands of people every year, so their word is meaningless. You're not talking to good people here, just people who pretend to be to make themselves appear virtuous", "Info :  Do you both pitch in equally for rent and utilities ?  If you're doing that and you (but not her) are saving half of your income towards your house fund...what is she doing with the other half of her income ?", "YTA. You live together so maintenance should be paid by both. You stated it wasn\u2019t her fault so if you don\u2019t pay half you are punishing her for doing the work. If you had done it the same thing might have happened.", "YTA you said so yourself that it\u2019s not her fault. The house is half yours and unless you\u2019re saying it is in fact her fault then it only makes sense to help her pay.", "YTA. When you are married, you are a team. There is no this is my money, this is her money. Your reasoning is illogical. You sound cheap.", "YTA. If a window is \u201crisking your future\u201d you\u2019re not going to be able to afford a house anytime soon. Might as well pay to repair the rental and alleviate your wife\u2019s stress. Also, I suspect the \u201chelp each other often\u201d might be a bit one sided and your wife is using this situation to change expectations. Just a suspicion though", "Wow you\u2019re dramatic af, YTA", "You\u2019re married. You share a house. An accident happened that costs money. The price of a window is not a substantial \u201crisk to your future.\u201d You are the asshole.", "YTA. Technically, maybe she should pay, since she did break the window, but you said it wasn't her fault. \n\n>We have separate banks and budgets but help each other often.\n\nSo help, what's the big deal?\n\n>Should I take money from the house fund and risk our future or let her pay it off?\n\nYou have been putting half your income into the house fund and paying for half the window's replacement cost puts your future at risk? Was this an elaborately etched or stained glass window?", "YTA. You must be in very dire straits if a paying for a half a pane of glass is going to risk your future", "Is everything all only alright in your marriage as long as the income is equal? Well heads up, if you stay married for more than five minutes this is absolutely certain to change.  Even if you have no kids and nothing goes wrong, the gender pay gap widens massively as women get older.  I have fought this for years and years in my highly paid career. The bottom line is that I have witnessed many brilliant women be overlooked and underpaid, while mediocre males just trundle through getting promoted and paid more for a lot less hassle. By stats alone you are likely to end up earning more than her in the end.\n\nThrow into the mix having babies, inevitable breaks in career, the imbalance of childcare and the increasing complexity of running a household with lots of people and admin - again typically the female dials down her career to keep the show on the road. In most relationships this is not a big deal, happy family life, but different incomes. Two parents trying to work full time and remain equally paid - recipe for household disharmony and acrimony.\n\nFinally, one or both of you may well get ill. You may need to be looked after, she may develop a long term condition that affects her ability to work. If you continue to see value only as long as your other half \u2018pulls their weight\u2019 you are not a genuine team.\n\nYou are married, combine your finances, save money in a joint pot, pay all bills together. Quit bean counting and start working on uniting the pair of you under some shared goals. Life will be much happier in the long term.\n\nEdit : slight YTA, I think you need to start looking at your marriage a bit differently", "YTA\n\n>She\u2019s saying that, since we\u2019re married and a team, I am responsible for half the payment.\n\nYeah you are. No wonder your wife can't manage to save money when you shove stuff like that solely on her lap.", "If the cost of one window is going to 'risk your future', you've got more problems than an argument with your wife. You seem a bit obsessive about this.\n\nThis is the time to be generous and kind. YWBTA not to help pay.", "yta, this is like any other home repair which can be needed through no fault of anyone. What are you going to do when you have a house and something spontaneously needs to be repaired? \n\nI'm genuinely confused as to how this works out. I realize I'm old fashioned with a combined income, but there has to be some middle ground between combining and what you're doing here.", "YTA.\nYou absolutely have the money. It's in your savings by your own admission. Replacing one window is not going to derail your long-term plans, but being an AH about this to your own wife might derail your marriage.", "So you both agree that it's not her fault and also that it's her responsibility? How those that make sense in your mind? Yes, take it out of The house fund, or whatever fund you use for house repairs.\n\nYTA", "YTA\nYou have a savings account for emergencies, random things that happen in life that you can\u2019t plan for (like a broke window). That\u2019s LITERALLY what it\u2019s for by definition. \nMaybe you and your wife should put your money together and live as husband and wife?  Stop with the my money, her money thing. You\u2019re married, you share everything in life, hence marriage. \nIf she made more than you would you expect her to give MORE of her money even though you\u2019re equal partners?

That\u2019s an issue.", "INFO: had you touched and it broke would you expect her to pay half?\n\nNAH \n\nLook I think that there is a big question here. Does it matter, at the end of the day the house equity will be dependant on what each of you bring financially.
