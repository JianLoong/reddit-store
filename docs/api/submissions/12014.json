I am completely happy with my weight and the way I look. I\u2019m also health conscious but late night snacks are a vice for me. Mind you, we keep a snack bin in our room because I have a endocrine disorder which messes with my insulin, it\u2019s called PCOS. People with it experience intense food cravings (typically sugar). I regulate the cravings with exercise.He also has an endocrine disorder and I frequently wake up to him munching on something. I\u2019ve even woken up to food wrappers in my bed and all I say is, \u201ccan you please throw these away!\u201d It something I thought we had accepted with one another.\n\nSo at 5:30 this morning, he wakes up to my crunching on crackers, while sitting on the corner of my bed. He sleeps heavy, so I was shocked I woke him. He responded, \u201cWhy are you eating right now?\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t been able to sleep all night and now I\u2019m hungry.\u201d To which he says, \u201cfor someone who is concerned about their weight, this is the worse time to be eating.\u201d I have said minor comments in the past like \u201cThese pants make my butt look huge\u201d or \u201cmaybe this is not the most flattering shirt because you can see my stomach\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019m fat. I respond, \u201cstop picking on me (at this point I\u2019m agitated.) He says \u201c I\u2019m your husband and I\u2019m trying to help you, it\u2019s not healthy.\u201d I say, leave me alone and go back to sleep.\u201d He storms out of the room and insists I\u2019m being mean to him!\u201d All the while I\u2019m apologizing asking him not to leave.\n\nI can completely understand how the crunch noise could be annoying. However, couldn\u2019t he of just said \u201cplease go eat in the other room\u201d or try to be more quiet?\u201d So, AITA here for waking him up or is he the asshole by saying he\u2019s helping me?\u201d BtW I would have happily moved to the other room if he told me to please put those away or got eat somewhere else. I just feel like this is gaslighting.\nEdit: there are pieces left out here to make the post shorter, so let me clarify. He\u2019s acting as though I have asked him the watch what I eat. I have never asked him to monitor what I eat. He is saying that I am saying and doing things I never did and then makes me feel bad because I\u2019m calling him out on that. He\u2019s using helping me in his defense to say rude shit when he\u2019s annoyed I\u2019ve never asked him to help me and he\u2019s acting as if I did. Look, I never claimed to be a psychologist.

If you want to eat something, go to the kitchen or pantry to get it, and eat outside the bedroom. This would allow you to burn off calories, and also, it would make it more likely that you're eating out of hunger, not boredom.
