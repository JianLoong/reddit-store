If you want to eat something, go to the kitchen or pantry to get it, and eat outside the bedroom. This would allow you to burn off calories, and also, it would make it more likely that you're eating out of hunger, not boredom.

Either something physical is making you hungry and have trouble sleeping or these are physical manifestations of emotional/mental struggles.
