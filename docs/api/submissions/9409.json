There are consequences for your actions. Your sister should realize this.", "NTA.  Your daughter is absolutely able to choose the guest list for jer borthday party just like your sister did for her wedding.\n\nYou reap what you sow.", "NTA.

Especially a 15/16yo who knows how to behave.  And even if you say the reception is 21+ I'm sure she'd have wanted to be at the ceremony.  \n\n> my sister told she wanted the freedom to go wild at her wedding and that my daughter would eventually get over it  \n\nTell your sister that your daughter wanted the freedom to be with people who want her around, and she'll eventually get over it.", "NTA. Your sister got to the \"find out\" portion of her fucking around. Shouldn't have set the kids hopes up by hyping up her role in a wedding then not inviting her.

I agree with everyone else here who says your daughter is merely returning your sister's \"favour\".\n\n2.

As you say in your edit, OP, it\u2019s only a birthday party, I\u2019m sure your sister \u2018would eventually get over it\u2019.

Ya know, exactly like your daughter is supposed to. \n\nWhen your sister whines about not being invited to your daughter's sweet 16 birthday party, remind her that your daughter gets to choose who she wants to attend. Just like your sister did with her wedding. \n\nAfter all if your daughter has to put on her big girl pants and *get over* not being included why can't your sister?", "NTA. \nI was not invited to my brothers wedding when I was 15 because his (now ex) wife didn\u2019t get on with her siblings and didn\u2019t invite them so her theory was \u2018fair is fair\u2019. 20 years later it still hurts to think about it and while I\u2019ve repaired my relationship with my brother it will never be the same. Your daughters relationship with your sister is fractured forever and your sister is simply acting entitled to think your daughter should have invited her to her birthday.", "nta. honestly you are hardly involved in this. more between the two of them. also. ppl with child free weddings are known to bend the rules for teenagers they are close with. i mean two years til shes an \u201cadult.\u201d lets be honest. thats an absolute snub.", "NTA you could answer the same as your sister did towards the feelings of your daughter. 'You'll eventually get over it'\n\nOn top of that, it is 'only' a birthday party (of which there ar normally 1 a year) where she got excluded from compared to a wedding (which hopefully is a once in a lifetime event), so I don't see why your sister's feelings of being excluded are more valid then those of your daughter.", "NTA and your little sister needs to grow up", "NAH.

She\u2019s upset with a child \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "You are correct but in a \"it's irrelevant\" way. The wedding was a general guardrails on age. The bride didn't choose the daughter exclusively. All kids were excluded. This is a specific target for a specific reason. So the daughter absolutely gets to decide who goes, but she can also do it for petty reasons.", "Yeah, especially with the edit OP added.  NTA", "Also 16 year olds aren't children, so honestly, excluding them from an event sounds more like a power trip than anything", "I reckon they probably intended that there should be drug use at their wedding, rather than just alcohol. Can't have a 16yo around when they're puffing a doobie.\nObviously getting wasted is more important to OPs sister than family relationships.", "I\u2019m close to family members I have 9y gab from. Maybe your life experience isn\u2019t the normality for everyone.", "The thing is 15 isn't that young. By that age, she's capable of looking after herself without needing her hand held and she'd be well aware that adults drink and let loose. If it was a 10yr old or something, I'd understand. Sis was being TA.

I've been to at least half a dozen weddings with an age limits somewhere in the 12 to 16 range. For a couple there was a higher limit for the reception and with a free flowing booze reception that's just a good idea anyway, you don't want kids at that.", "Just an FYI, that ONE reason to have a childfree wedding, the other reason is to allow for free drinking without worrying about minor supervision or underaged drinking, which was the reason the sister actually had a childfree wedding, especially seeing as she\u2019s 23, so the number of potential guests in the teen-21 class is very likely limited to just OP\u2019s daughter. \n\nThe idea is the same, sister can invite who she wants and so can daughter, especially as it was clearly communicated daughter was hurt. But, just to be clear, poorly behaved kids ruining the wedding isn\u2019t the only reason people have child free weddings.", "i remember that story and it was so stupid to read it. Like, I am from the Balkans, 40 days old babies are given weak wine during their baptism (Christians orthodox)  and the only law that stops children from drinking at any age is \"dont sell alcohol to someone who is under 18\". At weddings here, children as young 12 will be allowed to taste weak alcoholic drinks, and that Bridezilla or Groomzilla couldnt handle a 19 years drinking?", "I don't know what happens these days, but back when we used rocks scratched on cave walls as a form of communication, kids would be dancing in a group with a couple of tipsy aunties, uncles, and older cousins. Out of everyone else at least half of the guests would be shitfaced, while the other half would be the DD.\n\nI assure you we all survived the experience, and hardly spared a glance for uncle Craig throwing up in the pot plant, or aunty Sheryl drunkenly searching for her other shoe.", "And honestly, if I were the daughter, I\u2019d probably pull away from aunt.  She thought they were sooo close then to not be invited to her wedding?  What a kick in the gut.  I\u2019d be heartbroken.  \n\nSister has every right but she must face the consequences of her decision and it may cost the relationship with the daughter.", "Asking the real questions here! Even without children, there would surely still be elderly relatives in attendance. Their parents were there! How wild could it possibly have been?", "Only way I could see this making sense was if the wedding was fully open bar. That's the only type of \"child free\" wedding I've been too, where you had to be 21+ and the ceremony and reception were at the same venue, so no splitting up the kids/teens after.", "St. Peter don't you call me cause I can't go...", "Same in the UK. Excluding older teens - especially one you are so close to - is weird. What were they planning on doing - snorting coke off naked bodies?!\n\nAnd if sister says can invite who she wants to her party then so can OP\u2019s daughter.\n\nOP and daughter are NTA", "I don\u2019t really understand the concept of child free weddings. I understand that not all children of guests will be invited, but the children in your close family who you consider important to you? And also, not inviting a 16 yo?

Surprised that cf in this case meant 18 and under. Usually its young kids. Or 12 and under. And it's even more surprising since the daughter who she claimed to be so close to would get caught in that net. You'd think for that reason alone the bride would set the bar lower.", "I\u2019d give this comment an award if I had coins.  \ud83e\udd47", "We had a childfree wedding (anyone under 16) as we didn't want screaming kids or kids running about. That included nieces and nephews", "Are close family toddlers immune to typical toddler behavior? Because that's the point. No crying babies, finicky toddlers, excitedly whiny 8 y os. Family does not get a pass. There's no guarantee they will behave. Plus it really would cheese off the other guests if there are carveouts. Zero point to making exceptions.\n\nI do agree that it's weird to exclude older teens, esp under the circumstances.", "That's a bit extreme, she's like 23.

If she cared that much she should've thought about that earlier. Daughter will likely NEVER see sister in the same light after this. She's no longer her older wiser friend, she's now her married aunt who didn't want \"some dumb kid ruining her special day\".\n\nMale your bed, lie in it. Sister needs to stop whining about the consequences of her own actions like she didn't do it entirely herself.", "So your sister will get over not being invited to your daughters birthdays and milestone events.
